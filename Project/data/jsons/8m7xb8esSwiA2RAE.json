    "content": "After 10 long months of delay and recalcitrance , President Donald Trump has finally submitted his answers to some of special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s questions on Russian interference with the 2016 election , according to the president \u2019 s personal lawyers .\nWe don \u2019 t know whether these answers will be forthright , or whether the president will try to dodge the questions asked , since the format doesn \u2019 t allow for immediate follow-ups . ( Last week , Trump told Fox News \u2019 s Chris Wallace that he \u201c probably \u201d wouldn \u2019 t voluntarily agree to answer further questions from Mueller or do an in-person interview with the special counsel \u2019 s team . )\nBut Trump submitting his answers is still a significant moment for the probe . Unlike his many public statements , these statements to the special counsel are submitted at risk of legal penalties for making false statements . And after investigators judged President Bill Clinton to have made false statements in a deposition and grand jury interview , congressional Republicans made those statements the basis for articles of impeachment against him .\nTrump has spent hours meeting with his lawyers about the questions over several sessions , per the Washington Post . The morning after one meeting last week , he sent a series of tweets calling the Mueller investigation \u201c a disgrace to our Nation \u201d that was trying to \u201c destroy people \u201d and \u201c ruin \u201d lives \u2014 perhaps a sign he was having trouble with his answers .\nIt is possible that Trump has nothing serious to hide . Maybe his many months of refusing to agree to answer these questions are solely because he \u2019 s being cautious \u2014 because he fears a \u201c perjury trap \u201d or a \u201c witch hunt \u201d will ensnare him even though he \u2019 s done nothing wrong . Maybe the fact that he \u2019 s only answering these now that he \u2019 s installed a new acting attorney general he views as more loyal is also just a coincidence .\nBut if there is more to the story of what happened in 2016 than Trump has so far admitted , then the president has likely been struggling with some difficult choices behind the scenes .\nSuch as : Does he fess up to politically damaging and perhaps legally perilous conduct ? Or does he continue to try to conceal , or lie about , what happened \u2014 even in statements made under penalty of perjury ?\n\u201c Will Mueller interview Trump \u201d has become \u201c Will Trump deign to answer a very limited set of Mueller \u2019 s questions \u201d\nAll the way back in January , Mueller \u2019 s team first requested to question Trump as part of their investigation .\nThe stakes were high . Trump \u2019 s statements about many topics have often been ... factually challenged . But they are generally made to the press and the public , and not to federal law enforcement officers . Should Trump make false statements to Mueller \u2019 s team , there could be legal consequences for him ( potential impeachment while he \u2019 s in office , or even criminal charges after he leaves it ) .\nIn March , Mueller \u2019 s team told Trump \u2019 s lawyers about various topics they hoped to ask Trump about in person . Trump \u2019 s lawyers used this information to assemble a list of more than 40 likely questions , which the New York Times obtained earlier this year . Many of these questions related to obstruction of justice ( connected to Trump \u2019 s firing of FBI Director James Comey and pressure on Attorney General Jeff Sessions ) , but many others related directly to Russian interference .\nTrump \u2019 s team decided they did not want to have him answer these questions . They offered various shifting excuses for not agreeing to do the interview ( while dubiously claiming Trump himself still wanted to do it ) . The most common justifications for refusal were that they feared a \u201c perjury trap , \u201d that Trump had a tendency to make off-the-cuff misstatements , and that they had constitutional executive power concerns about the obstruction of justice questions .\nAll this time , the threat of Mueller subpoenaing Trump was hanging over everything . ( Mueller himself explicitly mentioned that possibility to Trump \u2019 s team , per the Post . ) This is one likely reason Trump didn \u2019 t just refuse to answer questions outright . Many legal experts believed that Trump would likely lose a battle over a subpoena in court , were one to occur . But that battle would take some time and hold up the investigation .\nEventually , a compromise was struck . For at least an initial set of questions , Mueller \u2019 s team agreed that Trump could answer in written form , rather than orally \u2014 minimizing the chances for an off-the-cuff misstatement . And he scaled back these initial questions to focus on the topic of collusion with Russia , not obstruction .\nMueller sent Trump those questions by mid-October . According to the Washington Post , there are about two dozen questions that focus on five topics . More than a month has passed since then . And finally , Trump sat down with his lawyers over several lengthy meetings last week to craft his answers .\nBill Clinton thought he could get away with lying about Monica Lewinsky\nAbout 20 years ago , President Bill Clinton was in a similar position . In a January 1998 deposition for Paula Jones \u2019 s sexual harassment lawsuit against him , Clinton was quizzed about his interactions with several women , including former White House intern and then employee Monica Lewinsky .\nAt the time , Clinton \u2019 s affair with Lewinsky wasn \u2019 t publicly known . If Clinton admitted to it , he \u2019 d cause a major scandal and suffer political embarrassment . But if he lied about it , he might get away with it . What evidence could there be , anyway ?\nSo Clinton proceeded to lie repeatedly , ludicrously claiming that he didn \u2019 t think he and Lewinsky had ever been alone in the Oval Office together , that if they had been together , \u201c nothing remarkable \u201d would have happened , and that he had \u201c never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky . \u201d\nNews of the affair broke days after the deposition . Clinton continued to deny it publicly , but independent counsel Ken Starr \u2019 s prosecutors amassed evidence including Lewinsky \u2019 s taped conversations , a blue dress stained with Clinton \u2019 s semen , and ( eventually ) Lewinsky \u2019 s cooperation .\nSo when Clinton agreed to testify to Starr \u2019 s grand jury , he finally admitted that when he was \u201c alone with Ms. Lewinsky on certain occasions , \u201d he had \u201c inappropriate , intimate contact \u201d with her . Still , Starr argued that Clinton lied three more times in the grand jury testimony , about the details and timeline of the affair . ( In the end , Clinton did \u201c get away with it \u201d in a sense after all , since he was impeached but not convicted , and he remained in office . )\nSo hypothetically , if someone is trying to get away with lying under oath rather than make damaging admissions , they are likely thinking about several questions . What do prosecutors suspect ? What do they know for sure ? What are they likely to find out eventually ? What will they have witnesses willing to testify about ? What can they prove with evidence ? Depending on the answers of these questions , it may be possible to get away with lies \u2014 or to get busted .\nDid Trump have an easy time answering the questions ? Accounts differ .\nThe Washington Post reported that Trump and his lawyers had a four-hour meeting about the questions last Monday , and a 90-minute meeting Wednesday . The morning after that second meeting , Trump sent a series of angry tweets about the Mueller investigation . We don \u2019 t know what \u2019 s been going on behind the scenes , but he certainly seemed agitated about the probe :\nThe inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess . They have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts . They are screaming and shouting at people , horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want . They are a disgrace to our Nation and don \u2019 t ... \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) November 15 , 2018\n.... care how many lives the ruin . These are Angry People , including the highly conflicted Bob Mueller , who worked for Obama for 8 years . They won \u2019 t even look at all of the bad acts and crimes on the other side . A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) November 15 , 2018\nUniversities will someday study what highly conflicted ( and NOT Senate approved ) Bob Mueller and his gang of Democrat thugs have done to destroy people . Why is he protecting Crooked Hillary , Comey , McCabe , Lisa Page & her lover , Peter S , and all of his friends on the other side ? \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) November 15 , 2018\nNaturally , Trump then insisted to Chris Wallace that answering the questions wasn \u2019 t \u201c a big deal \u201d and was \u201c very simple , \u201d because \u201c I did nothing wrong. \u201d He did not explain why it \u2019 s taken him so long to send the answers .\nHis lawyer Rudy Giuliani didn \u2019 t make it sound so simple . Around the same time , he told the Post that there were some of Mueller \u2019 s questions that \u201c create more issues for us legally than others , \u201d that some were \u201c unnecessary , \u201d that some were \u201c possible traps , \u201d and that he might \u201c consider some as irrelevant . \u201d\nMeanwhile , an update on Paul Manafort is coming by Monday\nIn the midst of all this , Mueller \u2019 s team submitted an interesting joint court filing with lawyers for Paul Manafort .\nThe former Trump campaign chair agreed to cooperate with Mueller \u2019 s investigation as part of a plea deal in September . Since then , he \u2019 s left jail to travel to the special counsel \u2019 s office at least nine times , per CNN . However , ABC News had a recent report claiming that the cooperation isn \u2019 t going well \u2014 that there is \u201c frustration over whether Manafort is fully providing the information he agreed to offer . \u201d\nNow , the new Manafort filing asks for just a 10-day extension in submitting an update about his case . \u201c The parties believe a brief extension of the status report date , until November 26 , 2018 , will allow them to provide the Court with a report that will be of greater assistance in the Court \u2019 s management of this matter , \u201d they write .\nThis is an unusually short extension for an update like this . It suggests that something will happen quite soon \u2014 by Monday \u2014 that will clarify Manafort \u2019 s case . ( Don \u2019 t expect big new details , necessarily , but we may get a clearer sense of how his cooperation has gone and whether he \u2019 s ready for sentencing . )\nMarcy Wheeler suggests several possible reasons for the short extension , with one of them being that Trump was expected to submit his answers to Mueller by then . Perhaps Manafort \u2019 s cooperation relates to those answers , and Mueller is waiting to have the answers in hand before revealing how cooperative or uncooperative Manafort is being .\nTrump also told Wallace that he \u201c probably \u201d won \u2019 t agree to any further questioning from Mueller \u2019 s team \u2014 meaning that he likely wouldn \u2019 t answer questions about whether he obstructed justice while in office , and likely wouldn \u2019 t agree to be interviewed in person .\nWhile many have long believed that Trump would never end up agreeing to an in-person interview with Mueller , his public admission of this is significant \u2014 and notably comes right after he \u2019 s ousted Jeff Sessions and gone around DOJ \u2019 s line of succession to install a loyalist , Matt Whitaker , as acting attorney general .\nWhitaker now oversees the special counsel investigation . Whether he yet knows the inner workings of the probe , and if so , whether he \u2019 s told Trump anything about them or interfered in any way , remains mysterious . Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-SC ) recently met with Whitaker , and claimed that Whitaker said he \u2019 s following \u201c regular order \u201d with regards to the investigation .\nBut Trump may believe Whitaker \u2019 s appointment removes or lessens the threat of a Mueller subpoena that \u2019 s been hanging over him all these months . \u201c White House aides and other people close to Mr. Trump anticipate that Mr. Whitaker will rein in any report summarizing Mr. Mueller \u2019 s investigation and will not allow the president to be subpoenaed , \u201d the New York Times reported shortly after Whitaker \u2019 s appointment . Around the same time , \u201c two people close to Whitaker \u201d told the Washington Post that \u201c he is deeply skeptical of any effort to force the president \u2019 s testimony through a subpoena . \u201d\nAnd now , Trump seems to believe he \u2019 s solved his problem . Asked about answering more Mueller questions , he told Wallace , \u201c I think we \u2019 ve wasted enough time on this witch hunt and the answer is probably , we \u2019 re finished . \u201d\n\u201c We gave very , very complete answers to a lot of questions that I shouldn \u2019 t have even been asked and I think that should solve the problem , \u201d he continued . \u201d I hope it solves the problem , if it doesn \u2019 t , you know , I \u2019 ll be told and we \u2019 ll make a decision at that time . But probably this is the end . \u201d",
