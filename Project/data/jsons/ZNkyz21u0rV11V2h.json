It \u2019 s why he lost yet another debate and why he will lose the election .\nThe post-debate coverage has been dominated by Mr. Trump \u2019 s refusal to say he won \u2019 t accept the election results , and rightly so . It would be a shocking statement , except for the fact that he has spent much of this month attempting to undermine the foundations of our democratic system .

Psychologically , he can not accept that ; for him , being labeled a loser is the ultimate humiliation . Therefore he has to manufacture an excuse for his impending defeat , and in this case , the excuse comes in the form of him repeatedly claiming that the election is rigged .\nBut that very claim , which is an extraordinary transgression of an unwritten and almost sacred democratic rule , not only will help insure his defeat , but will make the margin of that defeat even worse .\nMost Americans are unsettled and unnerved by Mr. Trump , and the more exposed to him they are , the more unsettled and unnerved they become . He doesn \u2019 t come across as an agent of change , which would help him ; instead , he comes across as a radical and destabilizing force , which hurts him .\nNarcissism \u2014 in this instance the inability to accept that he is likely to lose to a woman in the biggest contest in the world \u2014 was at the core of Mr. Trump \u2019 s answer about not being prepared to say he would abide by the outcome of the election . What Americans saw almost instantaneously in that answer is that the Republican nominee for president puts himself \u2014 his vanity , his self-obsession , his need to project dominance and therefore his need to win \u2014 far above everything in life , including the best interest of the nation . All of us struggle with pride and none of us is selfless ; but no one we have ever seen in American political life is as egotistical and selfish as Donald Trump .\nThat character flaw has led him to several terrible moments during this election , including the one in Wednesday \u2019 s debate that sealed his defeat .
