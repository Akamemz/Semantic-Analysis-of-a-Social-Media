    "content": "Artists going back and forth with their own faith\u2014between the temptations of worldly fame and the shelter , and strictures , of the church\u2014is a persistent motif in American popular music and in black American music above all . In declaring himself born again and renouncing secular music , as he \u2019 s done in the lead-up to his new album Jesus Is King , Kanye West is reenacting the story of Little Richard , for example , who channeled the sacred ecstasies of the black pulpit into the salacious come-ons of early rock \u2019 n \u2019 roll , then enrolled in theological college in the later 1950s , backslid into the wop-bop-a-loo-bop in the 1960s , then became an evangelical minister . And West is also playing out a conflict central to the soul music that he sampled and manipulated to forge the beloved style ( \u201c the old Kanye \u201d ) of his first several albums .\nFoundational soul stars such as Sam Cooke and Aretha Franklin made their names first in great gospel groups and choirs , then had to deal with a backlash from faith communities ( and often their families ) when they switched from extolling divine love to exercising earthier passions in much the same vocal styles . Al Green , for one , eventually repented his choice , after an angry lover scalded him with hot grits , and skedaddled his heavenly pipes more or less permanently back to the altar . Others managed to keep a foot in both camps , with Franklin in 1972 recording the bestselling gospel album of all time , Amazing Grace , without resigning her pop career .\nObservers who mostly know West for his ( as Barack Obama once put it ) \u201c jackass \u201d public antics and a few of his hits might be more suspicious of his come-to-Jesus moment\u2014which first started to surface with the weekly \u201c Sunday Service \u201d gospel-music events he and his spouse , Kim Kardashian West , have been hosting since January , building to more public versions at the Coachella festival and at churches around the country , and finally Jesus Is King , both the album and an Imax short film release under the same name . He \u2019 s also promised ( or threatened , depending on your point of view ) a sequel record , Jesus Is Born , to come out on Christmas Day . Plenty of wary church traditionalists and cultural secularists alike have called West out for \u201c fake Christianity , \u201d a celebrity self-servingly exploiting the black church \u2019 s forgiving embrace , sans the substance of the faith \u2019 s community mission . ( Christians , West raps on the album , \u201c will be the first ones to judge me/ Make it seem like nobody love me. \u201d ) Now , it \u2019 s not like gospel hasn \u2019 t had its own share of big charismatic egos in the past\u2014consider for instance the superstardom of James Cleveland , whose 1979 song \u201c God Is \u201d gets sampled on the Jesus Is King track of the same name , and who was Franklin \u2019 s musical director on Amazing Grace . Not to mention the womanizing reputation of Franklin \u2019 s own preacher dad . But perhaps it \u2019 s true West is just trying to get \u201c uncanceled \u201d after all his controversial stances on politics and race the past couple of years , which I won \u2019 t rehash here .\nJesus Is King makes me wonder both what West has to offer praise music and what it has to offer him .\nAnybody who \u2019 s followed West \u2019 s twists and torques closely is unlikely to believe it \u2019 s that simple . For one thing , West \u2019 s never been prone to cagey dissemblance\u2014massively unfiltered self-expression accounts for at least five out of seven of his deadliest sins . For another , religion has always been a subtheme in his music , from his name-making 2004 hit \u201c Jesus Walks \u201d \u2014which was groundbreaking at the time for rendering it not so uncool to mention God in a rap song\u2014through the visions of supernatural grandeur ( \u201c I Am a God \u201d ) he exhibited amid the arresting sonics of Yeezus , to the gospel sounds and references on 2016 \u2019 s The Life of Pablo . There , West welcomed worship-music star Kirk Franklin and the avidly churchgoing Chance the Rapper as guests and , in essence , chanted along with St. Augustine , \u201c God make me good\u2014just not yet. \u201d With Jesus Is King , it seems that \u201c yet \u201d has come . A year ago , West was putting out one of the crassest sex raps of his career in \u201c I Love It \u201d with Lil Pump . Now he \u2019 s admonishing his studio collaborators not to curse or have \u201c premarital sex. \u201d That story stirs memories of another perverse-turned-pious music legend , Prince , who later in life made musicians and friends pay fines to his \u201c swear jar \u201d for the same language that once made his own songs the object of scandalized congressional hearings .\nStill , it \u2019 s the speed and starkness of West \u2019 s turnabout that \u2019 s somewhat concerning . Interrogating his sincerity at this stage seems like a cul-de-sac , but Jesus Is King does make me wonder both what West has to offer praise music and what it has to offer him . Given the revelations last year about his hospitalization and diagnosis with bipolar disorder and his resistance to following medical prescriptions , as well as all the allusions to self-harm on last year \u2019 s half-finished-feeling album , Ye , not to mention the continuing erraticness of his public statements and inability to get his albums out on time if he gets them out at all , it \u2019 s difficult not to feel like West finding God at this juncture represents someone being corkscrewed around in an internal hurricane desperately lashing himself to the nearest rock .\nGet \u2588\u2588\u2588 Culture in Your Inbox The best of movies , TV , books , music , and more , delivered three times a week .

When I told an evangelical Christian acquaintance this weekend that I worried whether West was , so to speak , fit to consent to his own conversion , my friend gently replied that the faithful don \u2019 t believe it works that way\u2014it \u2019 s God who bestows the revelation , not the convert who rationally selects it . Paul didn \u2019 t fill out any paperwork to request that intervention en route to Damascus . My friend went on to say that in his circles , lots of people are quite hyped about the hip-hop star joining the righteous path . Which makes sense if you are convinced that everybody needs to be saved\u2014perhaps above all , as West says on the album \u2019 s second track , quoting from the most famous of gospel hymns , a \u201c wretch \u201d like him .\nOn the other hand , personally I don \u2019 t believe any of that , and it doesn \u2019 t entirely reassure me about whether musically immersing in and culturally debating West \u2019 s conversion aren \u2019 t deriving entertainment from somebody \u2019 s ongoing public breakdown . But I also don \u2019 t believe that people with mental health issues\u2014which to varying degrees describes a high percentage of the populace , myself not excluded\u2014aren \u2019 t entitled to both self-expression and agency over their own life choices . So is it right even to raise such hesitations ? I \u2019 m not at all sure . But it \u2019 s hard to avoid while listening to Jesus Is King , where the musical productions are often enticing and enveloping in the manner ( if not always to the standard ) of West \u2019 s best , while the lyrics\u2014when not directly drawn from Scripture , which supplies some reliable biblical-language zing\u2014seem more leaden and witless than ever before .\nThe line that got the most traction on Twitter and other platforms over the weekend was \u201c Closed on Sunday/ You my Chick-fil-A , \u201d which uses the chicken sandwich chain \u2019 s policy of keeping the Sabbath holy to advocate for the same in family life . ( The \u201c you \u201d here seems to be Kardashian West , who hasn \u2019 t always seemed to be in lockstep with every tenet of West \u2019 s new lifestyle . ) One snag here is that the song blithely bypasses Chick-fil-A \u2019 s long-standing association with anti-gay groups ; another is that it \u2019 s awfully thin stock for fans to be making such gravy of . But the way the half-sung words are overlaid on an exquisite Spanish guitar and cooed vocal sample from vintage Buenos Aires artist Chango Farias G\u00f3mez and the Grupo Vocal Argentino makes it more palatable than any track on which a man excoriates \u201c jezebels \u201d really has any right to be .\nThe album begins with a track on which West doesn \u2019 t appear at all vocally , \u201c Every Hour , \u201d which on first impression is a straight praise hymn being sung by the Sunday Service choir , directed by Los Angeles gospel and music business stalwart Jason White . White \u2019 s ensemble is also known as the Samples , which is particularly apt here , because the choir \u2019 s singing is manipulated in the production , sped up and sometimes seemingly phased out of synch with the accompaniment , to slightly dizzy and frantic effect . That prelude gives way to \u201c Selah , \u201d which opens with somber organ chords while West raps in his most breathlessly urgent mode about the general misbehavior ( \u201c keep perfect composure/ while I scream at the chauffeur \u201d ) and , to him , maltreatment that led to his spiritual crisis : He tells the \u201c woke \u201d that they should \u201c wake up \u201d and \u201c kiss and make up \u201d with him as a perceived \u201c Judas. \u201d As if they wouldn \u2019 t have already been awakened by the accumulation of floor-shaking drum blasts and the choir \u2019 s crescendoing hallelujahs .\nThat \u2019 s followed by one of my two or three favorite tracks , \u201c Follow God , \u201d which uses a 1970s gospel sample ( referencing the same \u201c father stretch my hands \u201d Scripture that structured two tracks on Life of Pablo ) as the backdrop to a rapid-fire account of a fight West had with his often-absent father over whether he was really being \u201c Christ-like \u201d in how he \u2019 s living out his new faith , climaxing comically , \u201c He starts spazzin \u2019 on me/ I start spazzin \u2019 back/ He said , \u2018 That ain \u2019 t Christ-like , \u2019 / I said , Ayaaaa ! \u201d The song has more typical Kanye-level energy than much of the album , but it also feels more true-to-life and less defensive than most of the album \u2019 s lyrics , just reporting about how starting out on a new path can be tense and tentative . It serves better than most of the lyrics to account for the verbal simplicity of much of Jesus Is King , in that as a newborn in the faith , it \u2019 s not as though West has much well-considered theological wisdom to dispense , unlike a lot of gospel music written or guided by experienced preachers . The narrative gets somewhat more sophisticated on \u201c Use This Gospel , \u201d another highlight ( and one of the remakes of tracks from last year \u2019 s scrapped-but-leaked Yandhi album ) , via the much-heralded reunion of the brothers of Clipse\u2014West \u2019 s frequent collaborator Pusha T and his long-absent partner No Malice , who was called just Malice until he underwent his own conversion around the turn of the decade . No Malice , with a couple of Christian rap albums already under his belt , begins his verse , \u201c A lot of damaged souls , I done damaged those , \u201d taking a kind of personal ownership of the scales of sin and redemption that West never quite achieves . I am less enamored with the Kenny G sax solo that caps the track ( as Richard Thompson once sang , \u201c I agree with Pat Metheny/ Kenny \u2019 s talents are too teeny \u201d ) , but I appreciate the cosmic absurdity of its existence .\nFor his part , though , West has only the wide-eyed , unsteady-on-his-feet drive of the fresh would-be zealot . If he falls back on old habits , such as narcissistic self-aggrandizement or being a millionaire whining about having to pay taxes ( see \u201c On God \u201d ) , that \u2019 s only human . But he can aspire to better . And he can evoke that aspiration via the illuminated-crystal sonic effects that he consistently pursues here , whether through the arpeggiated synths of \u201c On God , \u201d or the horns of the compact closing title track ( partly drawn from 1970s Quebecois prog rocker Claude L\u00e9veill\u00e9e ) , or most of all the spine-tingling layered voices , variously from Ty Dolla Sign ( \u201c Everything We Need \u201d ) , Ant Clemons ( \u201c Water \u201d and elsewhere ) , gospel star Fred Hammond ( \u201c Hands On , \u201d which drags ) , the James Cleveland choir sample ( \u201c God Is \u201d ) , and the Sunday Service voices .\nHis main error , I think , is in not relying even more extensively on the choir and developing Jesus Is King into more of a complete gospel album , at the expense of being quite as much of a true Kanye record . Only a few tracks here even break the three-minute mark , and even then West often seems to be scraping the barrel for lyric ideas ( viz . the \u201c Eve made apple juice \u201d bit on \u201c Everything We Need \u201d ) . Perhaps it was the urge to get in and out fast , leaning on the element of surprise , but West \u2019 s best work is almost always more extended , trafficking in themes and variations , in diptychs and triptychs . Ultimately , I feel as though I took more gospel feeling away from Life of Pablo , despite its many profane passages . While what \u2019 s left out of Jesus Is King , in terms of vice and self-indulgence , arguably counts as much as what is there , it suffers by using the Sunday Service choir mostly like a special effect rather than highlighting the individual voices within it across tracks , to lend it the texture and dynamics one hears in a really great gospel ensemble\u2014for an example , you need stray no further than comparing \u201c Every Hour \u201d to what you hear from Cleveland \u2019 s people on \u201c God Is. \u201d What \u2019 s more , putting a spotlight on the choir ensemble would have been more a proof of humility from West than anything he can proclaim verbally .\nThe film is almost comically modest for an artist who \u2019 s worked in the medium of his own ego as much as he has in music and fashion .\nIntriguingly , that is exactly what happens in Jesus Is King the movie . It takes nearly half its half-hour run before viewers ever see West \u2019 s face . For the first long while , there \u2019 s mostly the choir with White within the pastel-lit , keyhole-shaped caverns of artist James Turrell \u2019 s Roden Crater installation in the Arizona desert . Finally , after about 15 minutes , West joins the singers in rearview and silhouette , bobbing his head to the rhythm . Many minutes later , the choir completes a vigorous round of \u201c Selah \u201d hallelujahs , trades embraces , and disperses . Then we find West sweeping the space up with a broom\u2014genuinely putting himself in service\u2014warbling \u201c Street Lights \u201d to himself ( from 2008 \u2019 s 808s & Heartbreak ) . That clip transitions to West singing in a trio with a piano and organ player . Then again to him crooning to his infant son , Psalm , cradled to his naked chest . Cut to credits .\nThe film is almost comically modest for an artist who \u2019 s worked in the medium of his own ego as much as he has in music and fashion . It \u2019 s almost a manifesto of anti-narcissism . It \u2019 s also totally lush and gorgeous . There \u2019 s an especially striking extended sequence in which the fish-eye lens is staring up at White from below as he conducts the choir , which is off-camera but richly heard . In the next number , the camera zeroes in on one singer \u2019 s expressive features , not as she sings a solo but as she simply proceeds on through her harmony part . Between the two clips , there \u2019 s so much conveyed about both the individualism and the collectivity of the tradition , of gospel almost as a verb . The film isn \u2019 t as complex a text as the album ( in fact , it barely includes any of those songs ) , yet within the throughline of West \u2019 s creative career , it feels somehow more complete and satisfying . It \u2019 s a lesson to remember if his identity as a Christian artist is going to be one he sustains . On the other hand , the smart money might remember the many life cycles of Little Richard , and refrain for now from taking that bet .",

And he can evoke that aspiration via the illuminated-crystal sonic effects that he consistently pursues here, whether through the arpeggiated synths of \u201cOn God,\u201d or the horns of the compact closing title track (partly drawn from 1970s Quebecois prog rocker Claude L\u00e9veill\u00e9e), or most of all the spine-tingling layered voices, variously from Ty Dolla Sign (\u201cEverything We Need\u201d), Ant Clemons (\u201cWater\u201d and elsewhere), gospel star Fred Hammond (\u201cHands On,\u201d which drags ), the James Cleveland choir sample (\u201cGod Is\u201d), and the Sunday Service voices.\n\nHis main error, I think, is in not relying even more extensively on the choir and developing Jesus Is King into more of a complete gospel album, at the expense of being quite as much of a true Kanye record. Only a few tracks here even break the three-minute mark, and even then West often seems to be scraping the barrel for lyric ideas (viz. the \u201cEve made apple juice\u201d bit on \u201cEverything We Need\u201d). Perhaps it was the urge to get in and out fast, leaning on the element of surprise, but West\u2019s best work is almost always more extended, trafficking in themes and variations, in diptychs and triptychs. Ultimately, I feel as though I took more gospel feeling away from Life of Pablo, despite its many profane passages. While what\u2019s left out of Jesus Is King, in terms of vice and self-indulgence, arguably counts as much as what is there, it suffers by using the Sunday Service choir mostly like a special effect rather than highlighting the individual voices within it across tracks, to lend it the texture and dynamics one hears in a really great gospel ensemble\u2014for an example, you need stray no further than comparing \u201cEvery Hour\u201d to what you hear from Cleveland\u2019s people on \u201cGod Is.\u201d What\u2019s more, putting a spotlight on the choir ensemble would have been more a proof of humility from West than anything he can proclaim verbally.\n\nThe film is almost comically modest for an artist who\u2019s worked in the medium of his own ego as much as he has in music and fashion.\n\nIntriguingly, that is exactly what happens in Jesus Is King the movie. It takes nearly half its half-hour run before viewers ever see West\u2019s face. For the first long while, there\u2019s mostly the choir with White within the pastel-lit, keyhole-shaped caverns of artist James Turrell\u2019s Roden Crater installation in the Arizona desert. Finally, after about 15 minutes, West joins the singers in rearview and silhouette, bobbing his head to the rhythm. Many minutes later, the choir completes a vigorous round of \u201cSelah\u201d hallelujahs, trades embraces, and disperses. Then we find West sweeping the space up with a broom\u2014genuinely putting himself in service\u2014warbling \u201cStreet Lights\u201d to himself (from 2008\u2019s 808s & Heartbreak). That clip transitions to West singing in a trio with a piano and organ player. Then again to him crooning to his infant son, Psalm, cradled to his naked chest. Cut to credits.\n\nThe film is almost comically modest for an artist who\u2019s worked in the medium of his own ego as much as he has in music and fashion. It\u2019s almost a manifesto of anti-narcissism. It\u2019s also totally lush and gorgeous. There\u2019s an especially striking extended sequence in which the fish-eye lens is staring up at White from below as he conducts the choir, which is off-camera but richly heard. In the next number, the camera zeroes in on one singer\u2019s expressive features, not as she sings a solo but as she simply proceeds on through her harmony part. Between the two clips, there\u2019s so much conveyed about both the individualism and the collectivity of the tradition, of gospel almost as a verb. The film isn\u2019t as complex a text as the album (in fact, it barely includes any of those songs), yet within the throughline of West\u2019s creative career, it feels somehow more complete and satisfying. It\u2019s a lesson to remember if his identity as a Christian artist is going to be one he sustains. On the other hand, the smart money might remember the many life cycles of Little Richard, and refrain for now from taking that bet.\n\nRead more in Slate about Kanye West.",
