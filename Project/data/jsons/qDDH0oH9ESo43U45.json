That not only means he will be able to fill former justice Antonin Scalia 's vacant seat on the Supreme Court , but he will also quite likely get to replace one of the liberal members of the court , such as Ruth Bader Ginsburg ( age 83 ) or Stephen Breyer ( age 78 ) . As I previously reported , same-sex marriage and to a lesser extent abortion rights are both shielded from immediate legal threats , thanks to protections offered by previous Supreme Court decisions .\nUnfortunately , the same can not be said of voting rights , which are in serious and pressing danger from a Trump presidency .\n`` It \u2019 s not the apocalypse yet , '' Dale Ho , the director of the voting rights project at the American Civil Liberties Union , explained over the phone . `` It could be the apocalypse . I \u2019 m not going to say it \u2019 s not going to be the apocalypse . But on voting , we \u2019 re obviously not in as good a position as we expected to be in , and we \u2019 re going to have to wait and see . \u201d\nHo cautioned supporters of voting rights to not give up and lose hope . For instance , he noted , the Fifth Circuit Court , the most conservative of the circuit courts , struck down a restrictive Texas voter-ID law in July . Nine out of the court 's 15 judges \u2014 five Democratic appointees and four Republican appointees \u2014 backed the decision to overturn the law .\nThis suggests , Ho said , `` that we have penetrated the consciousness of moderate conservatives on this issue . '' For instance , he said , we can not know for certain how Justice Anthony Kennedy , the court 's most prominent middle-road conservative , is likely to rule on voting-rights cases .\nBut while it 's not yet time to give up hope entirely and move to New Zealand , there is cause to be worried about the fate of voting rights in this country . The possibility of Trump 's naming not just one but two right-wing justices to the high court creates two major sources of headaches for voting rights advocates .\nThe first is the current right-wing efforts to restrict voting rights .\n`` For the last five years , we were largely in a defensive posture on voting rights , '' Ho explained , noting that in 2013 Scalia joined the 5-4 majority in voting to weaken the Voting Rights Act .
