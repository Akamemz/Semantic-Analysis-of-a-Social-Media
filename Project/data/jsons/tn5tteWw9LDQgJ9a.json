But he said if Congress votes to kill the agreement next month , military action will be likely against Tehran .\n\u201c At that point we really don \u2019 t have options , \u201d the president said . \u201c We \u2019 re kind of flying blind . The logical conclusion is that for any president , me or my successor , to make sure that Iran \u2019 s not getting a nuclear weapon , I \u2019 m going to have to resort to some sort of military action because there aren \u2019 t going to be many other options left to us . \u201d\nHe added , \u201c That \u2019 s not to suggest that opponents of this deal want war .
