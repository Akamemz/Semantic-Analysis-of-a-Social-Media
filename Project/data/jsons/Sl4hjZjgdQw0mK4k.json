That may seem like a narrow and technical issue, but it raises the fundamental question before us in the 2020 election: can we make our government work for the people?\n\nIn 2007, I came up with the idea for the CFPB \u2014 a new federal agency dedicated to protecting families from predatory financial products and holding financial firms accountable for cheating consumers.

And despite intense lobbying from special interests, President Obama signed that agency into law. Since the agency opened its doors in 2010, it has returned nearly $12 billion to people who were cheated.\n\nThe CFPB has been a success in part because Congress designed it to be insulated from the undue influence of Wall Street.
