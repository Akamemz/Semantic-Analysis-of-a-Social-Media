( China Daily/Reuters )\nA large portion of Washington media have decided the big story of the day is President Trump telling CBS White House correspondent Weijia Jiang \u201c Ask China , \u201d after she asked , \u201c Why does [ the rate of U.S. testing to other countries ] matter ? Why is this a global competition to you if every day Americans are still losing their lives and we \u2019 re still seeing more cases every day ? \u201d The general argument is that Trump \u2019 s response to Jiang was racist .\nRather than the ten-millionth \u201c can you believe President Trump said that ? \u201d story , let \u2019 s take a look at what \u2019 s actually going on in China .\nThere is widespread consensus outside of China that whatever the actual tally of coronavirus deaths in that country was , the sum was significantly higher than the officially released numbers . The Washington Post felt sufficient confidence to write on April 3 that evidence such as the number of hours that crematoriums were working and the number of urns returned by funeral homes added up to a death toll around 42,000 to 47,000 .\nBack in mid-April , Wuhan health officials revised their local death toll from 2,579 to 3,869 . One-half of the previous total is 1,289.5 ; the increase was 1,290 \u2014 almost as if someone arbitrarily decided to raise the existing death toll by fifty percent .\n( If you \u2019 re wondering about those 21 million cell phone subscriptions that disappeared , Chinese cell phone companies stated that they were cancelations driven by economic and lifestyle changes during the outbreak . While I think the Chinese government \u2019 s capacity for dishonestly , coverups , and propaganda is considerable , hiding 21 million deaths would be a real logistical challenge . )\nChina also contends that it has had only a handful of new cases in a country of more than a billion people in March , April , and so far in May , and only one death since April 17 . As far as the Chinese government is telling the world , they have the coronavirus beaten once and for all .\nOr maybe not : \u201c Authorities in the central Chinese city of Wuhan , where the pandemic coronavirus was first detected , have ordered fresh Covid-19 tests for all of its 14 million residents after a cluster of new community cases . The unprecedented move came after reports on the weekend of six new coronavirus cases from the same residential compound , known as Sanmin . \u201d\nAnd it \u2019 s not just Wuhan again : \u201c On Sunday , Chinese authorities reclassified Shulan , a city near the Russian and North Korean borders , as high risk , after a cluster of cases connected to a woman with no known history of travel or exposure to the virus . \u201d\nWe know the Chinese national and Wuhan local authorities never like admitting bad news unless they have to , and when they do admit bad news , it is likely drastically understated .\nFor a long time in the Soviet Union , understanding what was really going on required \u201c reading between the lines \u201d \u2014 noticing changes in standard phrases , the absence of certain expected points , or other ways to hint at or allude to arguments that ran counter to the official Communist Party line .\nNotice this article that originally appeared in the Chinese business publication Caixin :\nAs of Friday , the national drug regulator approved 30 testing kits for the virus , including 19 nucleic acid tests and 11 antibody tests . The combined manufacturing capacity of testing kits surpassed 9 million a day , according to the National Medical Products Administration . Statistics from Dongxing Securities showed that in normal operation , medical institutions in China could test a total of 1.66 million people a day , matching the basic needs of massive testing as social activities resume . But access to testing has been uneven . While big cities including Beijing , Guangdong and the epicenter Wuhan have greatly expanded capacity and allowed residents to take tests as they wish , people in remote areas such as Heilongjiang still face difficulties . There is \u201c no chance \u201d that the coronavirus pandemic will end soon , and countries must prepare for a \u201c new normal \u201d amid plans to reopen , said Zhang Wenhong , head of the infectious diseases department of Huashan Hospital of Fudan University in Shanghai and director of the city \u2019 s COVID-19 clinical expert team .\nDoes this sound like a country that has had only a handful of cases in the past ten weeks ?\nChinese movie theaters briefly reopened in March , then suddenly closed again .
