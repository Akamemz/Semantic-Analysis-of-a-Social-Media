    "content": "In the wake of President Obama 's re-election , the public opinion dam has seemingly begun to burst on one hotly-contested social issue : Same-sex unions . Are Americans moving decisively leftward on abortion , too ? I spent the last week in Boulder , Colorado at the annual Conference on World Affairs . It 's an overwhelmingly liberal crowd , so one of my more challenging tasks was discussing `` reproductive rights '' on a panel comprised of pro-choice women and me . In order to inoculate myself against the inevitable `` you 're not a woman '' critique , I cited statistics demonstrating that ( a ) being pro-life is a mainstream , if not majority position ; and ( b ) women are statistically just as likely to be pro-life as pro-choice . I drew on a pair of 2012 polls . The first , from Gallup , recorded a record-low 41 percent of Americans self-identifying as pro-choice , with a +2 pro-life `` gender gap '' among women . The other was from CNN , which pegged pro-life sentiment at 52 percent overall , with women deadlocked on the issue . Here 's a snapshot of the Gallup stats :\nSince last fall , however a number of public surveys have detected a lurch to the left on these questions . Rasmussen has measured a fairly sharp turnabout , while NBC/WSJ found a majority in favor of legal abortion in `` all or most '' circumstances for the first time . But the NBC/WSJ polling partnership released a new poll last week , which I linked in passing . I did n't dig into the numbers too thoroughly beyond Obama 's weak approval numbers ; luckily , Allahpundit did , and he discovered an about-face on abortion , with the new data reflecting the prevailing attitudes mentioned above :\nThat 's a 52/45 pro-life split , with a sizable plurality ( 42 percent ) embracing most Republicans ' mainstream stance . Question , then : Why did pro-choice sentiment spike in late 2012 and early 2013 ? I 'd submit that blanket coverage of Todd Akin 's egregious comments really poisoned the well for the pro-life brand . People said to themselves , `` I 'm not comfortable with abortion in a lot of circumstances , but if that 's what they believe , I do n't want to be a part of that . '' This , skeptics of abortion-on-demand went `` pro-choice '' to avoid being lumped in with the ( barely existent ) no-exceptions , `` legitimate rape , '' anti-biology crowd . AP also links to a WaPo infographic showing that large majorities support abortions under limited and rare scenarios , including the life of the mother being at risk , rape , and birth defects . On the other hand , near super-majorities oppose abortion for the most common reasons . I 'd love to see the numbers on gender-selective abortions -- which House Democrats refused to oppose last year . Or repeats , which account for roughly 50 percent of abortions in America today . Or full-stop infanticide . The vast majority of abortions are obtained for reasons of convenience , and approximately half are performed on women who 've terminated at least one previous pregnancy . Pro-lifers faced a backlash when one of their own made ignorant remarks that were covered ad nauseam . Will pro-choicers see the same effect now that one of their extremists is on trial for murdering seven infants and an adult patient ? Lurid revelations of newborns being decapitated at birth amidst horrific conditions might be rather bad for business for the abortion industry , which may explain why their media supporters did their level best to bury the Gosnell story . The ghastly truth is finally winning out , thanks to a coordinated PR push from abortion opponents . And it 's grisly . It turns out the sanitary conditions were so breathtakingly poor because the Philadelphia clinic never faced inspections ... for entirely political reasons .
