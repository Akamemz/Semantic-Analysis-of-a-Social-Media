    "content": "In the late-1980s heyday of the anti-drug `` Just Say No '' campaign , a man calling himself `` Jerry '' appeared on a Seattle talk radio show to criticize U.S. marijuana laws .\nAn esteemed businessman , he hid his identity because he did n't want to offend customers who \u2014 like so many in those days \u2014 viewed marijuana as a villain in the ever-raging `` war on drugs . ''\nNow , a quarter century later , `` Jerry '' is one of the main forces behind Washington state 's successful initiative to legalize pot for adults over 21 . And he no longer fears putting his name to the cause : He 's Rick Steves , the travel guru known for his popular guidebooks .\n`` It 's amazing where we 've come , '' says Steves of the legalization measures Washington and Colorado voters approved last month . `` It 's almost counterculture to oppose us . ''\nA once-unfathomable notion , the lawful possession and private use of pot , becomes an American reality this week when this state 's law goes into effect . Thursday is `` Legalization Day '' here , with a tote-your-own-ounce celebration scheduled beneath Seattle 's Space Needle \u2014 a nod to the measure allowing adults to possess up to an ounce of pot . Colorado 's law is set to take effect by Jan. 5 .\nHow did we get here ? From `` say no '' to `` yes '' votes in not one but two states ?\nThe answer goes beyond society 's evolving views , and growing acceptance , of marijuana as a drug of choice .\nIn Washington \u2014 and , advocates hope , coming soon to a state near you \u2014 there was a well-funded and cleverly orchestrated campaign that took advantage of deep-pocketed backers , a tweaked pro-pot message and improbable big-name supporters .\nGood timing and a growing national weariness over failed drug laws did n't hurt , either .\n`` Maybe ... the dominoes fell the way they did because they were waiting for somebody to push them in that direction , '' says Alison Holcomb , the campaign manager for Washington 's measure .\nWashington and Colorado , both culturally and politically , offered fertile ground for legalization advocates \u2014 Washington for its liberal politics , Colorado for its libertarian streak , and both for their Western independence .\nBoth also have a history with marijuana law reform . More than a decade ago , they were among the first states to approve medical marijuana .\nStill , when it came to full legalization , activists hit a wall . Colorado 's voters rejected a measure to legalize up to an ounce of marijuana in 2006 . In Washington , organizers in 2010 could n't make the ballot with a measure that would have removed criminal penalties for marijuana .\nSince the 1970 founding of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws , reform efforts had centered on the unfairness of marijuana laws to the recreational user \u2014 hardly a sympathetic character , Holcomb notes .\nThat began to change as some doctors extolled marijuana 's ability to relieve pain , quell nausea and improve the appetites of cancer and AIDS patients . The conversation shifted in the 1990s toward medical marijuana laws . But even in some states with those laws , including Washington , truly sick people continued to be arrested .\nImproved data collection that began with the ramping up of the drug war in the 1980s also helped change the debate . Late last decade , with Mexico 's crackdown on cartels prompting horrific bloodshed there and headlines here , activists could point to a stunning fact : In 1991 , marijuana arrests made up less than one-third of all drug arrests in the U.S. Now , they make up half \u2014 about 90 percent for possession of small amounts \u2014 yet pot remains easily available .\n`` What we figured out is that your average person does n't necessarily like marijuana , but there 's sort of this untapped desire by voters to end the drug war , '' says Brian Vicente , a Denver lawyer who helped write Colorado 's Amendment 64 . `` If we can focus attention on the fact we can bring in revenue , redirect law enforcement resources and raise awareness instead of focusing on pot , that 's a message that works . ''\nWith a potentially winning message , the activists needed something else : messengers .\nSteves , who lives in the north Seattle suburb of Edmonds , was a natural choice \u2014 the `` believable , likeable nerd , '' as he calls himself . Known for his public television and radio shows , as well as his `` Europe through the Back Door '' guide books , he openly advocated in 2003 for a measure that made marijuana the lowest priority for Seattle police .\nHe already knew Holcomb , who had been the drug policy director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington state . The ACLU chapter recognized that voter education would be crucial to any future reform , especially after polling revealed that many voters did n't even know Washington had a medical marijuana law .\nHolcomb helped recruit Steves to star in a 2008 infomercial designed to get people talking about marijuana law reform . The video was aired on late-night television and at forums held across the state , during which experts in drug policy answered questions from audiences .\nIn November 2009 , John McKay , the former Seattle U.S. attorney , agreed to appear on one of those panels . McKay was well respected , from a prominent Republican family and had served as the Justice Department 's top prosecutor in western Washington \u2014 charged with carrying out U.S. drug laws .\nHe called for a top-to-bottom review of the nation 's drug war and endorsed regulating marijuana like alcohol .\nOver the next year , a voter initiative drive and legislative efforts gained steam but ultimately failed . California 's Proposition 19 legalization measure also failed in 2010 . But even with little money and no significant editorial endorsements , in an off-presidential election year with lower youth turnout , Prop 19 received more than 46 percent of the vote .\nHolcomb thought : Imagine what Washington could do in a presidential year , with an endorsement from McKay and some money .\nSo , with the backing of the ACLU 's state chapter , Holcomb formed New Approach Washington . In June 2011 , the group announced Initiative 502 , to legalize up to an ounce of marijuana and to create a system of state-licensed growers , processors and retail stores . It was tailored to gain mainstream support : There would be no home-growing , and there would be a DUI standard designed to be comparable to the 0.08 limit for blood-alcohol content .\nThe drug also would be taxed at every stage , from growing and processing to selling . State studies were done showing legalization could bring in half a billion dollars a year for schools , health care and substance-abuse prevention .\nThe list of co-sponsors was unimpeachable : Steves , McKay , Seattle City Attorney Pete Holmes , the former top public health officer for Spokane County , two past presidents of the state bar association , a top University of Washington addiction expert . The Seattle Times ' editorial page offered its own endorsement .\nNational drug-policy reform groups also were focusing on 2012 . The New York-based Drug Policy Alliance saw campaigns developing in three states \u2014 Washington , Colorado and Oregon \u2014 and it had the money on-the-ground advocates so desperately needed . The alliance is funded in part by billionaire and longtime liberal political donor George Soros , who came out in favor of marijuana legalization in 2010 .\nThe organization chipped in more than $ 1.6 million in Washington . The Washington , D.C.-based Marijuana Policy Project gave $ 1 million in Colorado .\nThen came another big donor . Peter Lewis , the founder of Progressive Insurance , had used marijuana after a leg amputation and had been a big contributor to medical marijuana campaigns . His people initially told Holcomb they did n't think I-502 would pass , but then he offered a match : If they could raise $ 650,000 , he 'd kick in $ 250,000 . New Approach Washington met the goal , and Lewis became the campaign 's biggest donor , responsible for more than $ 2 million of the $ 6 million raised .\nThe money ensured that Washington 's activists could keep their message on air , and they did so effectively .\nThe first television ad , which aired last summer , featured a middle-aged mom saying that she did n't like marijuana , but that taxing it would bring in money for schools and health care and free up police resources . Among women aged 30 to 50 , Holcomb says , support for regulating marijuana jumped about 18 percent .\nThe next ads featured McKay , former Seattle U.S. Attorney Kate Pflaumer and Charles Mandigo , the former head of the FBI office in Seattle , urging approval of I-502 .\nColorado 's measure did n't have the big-name endorsements that Washington 's did , but the state had other things going for it . For one , it already had the most highly regulated medical marijuana market in the country . There , organizers were careful to appear before news cameras in suits and ties . Ads featured middle-aged women , or schoolchildren who could benefit from marijuana taxes .\nOpponents tried to fight back , mounting a $ 543,000 campaign in Colorado , with backing from a Florida-based anti-drug group and an evangelical Christian group .\nIn Washington , a small group from the medical marijuana community raised $ 6,800 to oppose I-502 .
