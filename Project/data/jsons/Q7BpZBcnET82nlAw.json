Those formal sessions mean that the Senate is not in recess and that President Trump can not use the recess-appointment power to unilaterally make appointments . This , by the way , is exactly what the Senate did during President Barack Obama \u2019 s term to prevent him from making his own recess appointments . And in 2014 , the Supreme Court upheld the Senate \u2019 s power to do that \u2026 \u201c All this talk of adjournments and recesses may sound technical . But many important principles of constitutional law are embodied in constitutional fine print . Most obviously , a president can not just make Congress disappear when he wishes\u2014in order to end an oversight investigation , for instance , or to prevent Congress from voting against a war he would like to wage . As for the question of staffing the government , the Supreme Court explained in its 2014 decision that the primary method prescribed by the Constitution for appointing officers of the United States\u2014including the attorney general , Supreme Court justices , and more than 1,000 other varied jobs\u2014is presidential nomination plus Senate confirmation\u2026 The president generally can \u2019 t just cut Congress out of the picture. \u201d Neal K. Katyal and Thomas P. Schmidt , The Atlantic\nMoreover , \u201c Despite Trump \u2019 s claim that he has a \u2018 very strong power \u2019 to adjourn Congress , this power is actually quite limited . The Constitution provides that the president may adjourn both houses of Congress \u2018 to such Time as he shall think proper , \u2019 but only \u2018 in Case of Disagreement between them , with Respect to the Time of Adjournment. \u2019 Thus , the president \u2019 s power to adjourn Congress is only triggered when the two houses disagree about when to adjourn\u2026 right now the House and Senate are in agreement about when to adjourn \u2014 they plan to formally adjourn on January 3 , 2021\u2026 \u201c All of that said , if McConnell were determined to engineer a situation where Trump could make recess appointments , he could most likely do so\u2026 Let \u2019 s suppose , for the sake of argument , that Trump succeeds in adjourning the Senate . Then what ? The most likely answer is that Trump would have to keep Congress out of session for a decent amount of time\u2026 Democratic political operatives couldn \u2019 t dream of a more damaging story to tell about Trump during a presidential election year . The president is threatening to delay stimulus legislation , relief for many people who are unemployed , and potentially funding for necessary public health measures , over a petty dispute about a few political job vacancies. \u201d Ian Millhiser , Vox\n\u201c On its face , Trump \u2019 s argument for doing this is absurd . The compliant Republican-controlled Senate has confirmed most nominees this president has put forth . Yet some of the most critical positions in the government \u2014 including the secretary and deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 remain without a confirmed official in place to this day not because of Senate dawdling but because the president hasn \u2019 t gotten around to making a selection . Indeed , Trump has said that he likes having senior roles in government filled by acting officials , who may be more eager to please him .
