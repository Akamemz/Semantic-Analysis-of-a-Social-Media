    "content": "Of late , Bernie Sanders has been under assault from the technocratic wing of the Democratic Party . The charge ? His campaign has circulated economic projections that show stunning \u2014 and rather implausible \u2014 benefits from Sanders 's agenda .\nSanders 's `` promises runs against our party 's best traditions of evidence-based policy making and undermines our reputation as the party of responsible arithmetic , '' wrote four Democratic ex-chairs of the White House 's Council of Economic Advisers . `` These are numbers we would describe as deep voodoo if they came from a tax-cutting Republican , '' agreed Paul Krugman .\nAmidst this onslaught , Steve Randy Waldman has penned what is , I think , the best defense of Sanders . He admits that the campaign 's policy proposals are sketchy and the economic projections it 's circulating are fantastical . But he argues that none of that really matters .\nThe president 's `` role is to define priorities that must later be translated into well-crafted policy details , '' he says . `` In a democratic polity , wonks are the help . ''\nWaldman has a point . If elected president , Sanders could certainly get some top economists to tighten his policies . He would have the vast machinery of the federal government available to sweat the details . The best experts in academia would be honored to advise him . Every think tank in town would produce reams of research on how to implement his ideas .\nAnd , hell , let 's just be honest : All this policy talk is just a way to pass the time between now and the election . It does n't matter how strong Bernie Sanders 's single-payer health care plan is \u2014 it 's not going to pass , just like Donald Trump is n't going to get Mexico to pay for a wall and Hillary Clinton is n't going to get universal pre-K past a Republican Congress and Ted Cruz is n't going to set up a value-added tax .\nIt 's obvious that debating the details of campaign proposals is , on some level , fantasy football for wonks . Events will intercede , bureaucracies will weigh in , Congress will balk , promises will be broken . Remember when Barack Obama ran for president opposing an individual mandate and then flip-flopped and supported one ? So what 's the point of paying attention to any of this at all ?\nAs someone who pays quite a lot of attention to campaign policy processes , here 's my answer : Watching a candidate run his campaign 's policy processes is one of our best ways of predicting how he would run his White House .\nThe key word there , by the way , is run . Some of the most important decisions the president makes are about how to run the processes that translate vision into policy . Those decisions include whom to hire , which advisers to listen to , which ideas make sense , which strategies are likely to work . The presidency is one damn decision like that after another . Obama , famously , is so exhausted by the decision fatigue of the job that he wears the same color suit every day so he has one less thing to decide in the morning .\nThis is one way in which campaigns give us insight into presidencies . Presidential candidates also have to decide whom to hire , which advisers to listen to , which ideas are truly good ones , which strategies are likely to work . To make those decisions well , they need a sound philosophy , yes , but they also need to want to hear good advice , they need to want advisers who will tell them when they 're wrong , they need to have good instincts for when something they want to believe is true simply is n't , and they need to be realistic about the strategies that are likely to work and the ones that are n't .\nMy worry about Sanders , watching him in this campaign , is that he is n't very interested in learning the weak points in his ideas , that he has n't surrounded himself with people who police the limits between what they wish were true and what the best evidence says is true , that he does n't seek out counterarguments to his instincts , that he 's attracted to strategies that align with his hopes for American politics rather than what we know about American politics . And these tendencies , if they persist , can turn good values into bad policies and an inspiring candidate into a bad president .\nThe reason I care about the puppies-and-rainbows promises of his single-payer proposal is that I think Sanders believes them \u2014 I do n't think he 's a cynical politician simply eliding the weaknesses of his plan . The reason I care about his campaign 's circulation of fairly outlandish economic projections is that it makes me worry there 's no one around Sanders with the sense to say that those results do n't pass the smell test . The reason I 'm frustrated by Sanders 's promise that a political revolution will overcome all opposition to his plans is I think he believes it , and so I 'm not sure he has a real plan B for when the political revolution does n't happen . The reason Sanders 's persistently superficial answers on foreign policy matter to me is that they 're a test of his ability to learn on the fly about topics he 's not terribly interested in .\nIn a democratic polity , wonks are the help . But that only underscores the importance of electing someone good at hiring and managing them . A President Sanders could hire excellent technocrats to help him make policy , but would he want to ? A President Sanders could surround himself with experts who know the shortcomings of his ideas , but would he listen to them ? A President Sanders could become deeply engaged on foreign policy , but would he decide to ?\n( A similar argument explains why I 'm unimpressed by those who dismiss Hillary Clinton 's email travails and wave away her decision to accept $ 675,000 from Goldman Sachs in return for three speeches . These were choices that spoke to Clinton 's willingness to bend rules or violate norms in ways she knew would look bad to voters when she deemed it in her self-interest . The presidency is full of moments when there 's something the president could do , and maybe even wants to do , but probably should n't do . I worry about the choices she 'll make in those moments . )\nManagement is n't the sexiest or most inspiring of topics . But , as Jimmy Carter can tell you , it matters .

'' ) and good advice from ideological fantasies . I have always thought this story , reported by Megan McArdle , showed the mundane ways in which Bush 's deficiencies diminished his presidency :\nA senior economic adviser for George W. Bush once told me a rather haunting story about the administration \u2019 s decision to sign the 2002 farm bill ... Like virtually all sound economists , Bush \u2019 s advisers disliked the bill , a subsidy-laden monstrosity that was considerably worse than the farm bill that had preceded it in 1996\u2014but they reluctantly allowed it to go forward , because they thought passing the farm bill would buy legislative support for something they considered even more important : the authority the president needed to advance the next round of treaty negotiations at the World Trade Organization .
