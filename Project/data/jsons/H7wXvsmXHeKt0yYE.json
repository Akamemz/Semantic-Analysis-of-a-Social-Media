Early on , the narrative I embraced about Lewiston \u2019 s newcomers was of passive refugee-victims . The life they fled in Africa did leave considerable scars , but over time I came to see that the new immigrants were not passive . Their resilience has moved and inspired me . One early acquaintance , Fatuma Hussein , founded United Somali Women of Maine to promote gender equality . She \u2019 d come to the U.S. at age 13 from a Somali refugee camp . The first line in my Lewiston notebook was hers : \u201c We are making new lives here . \u201d\nFatuma has made a new life . She and her husband , Muktar , have eight children , from college-aged to preschooler . The organization she founded in 2001 , known now as the Immigrant Resource Center of Maine , is one of the city \u2019 s largest nonprofits . There are stresses : family responsibilities and a perpetually jammed schedule , plus funding pressures as other Somali nonprofits have cropped up . Then there \u2019 s Fatuma \u2019 s de facto role as spokeswoman . She \u2019 s become a voice of Somali women in Maine , asked to testify when the Legislature considers refugee-related bills and sometimes quoted by the media . That role has intensified in the aftermath of Donald Trump \u2019 s election . More and more she feels like a mandated emissary of the Lewiston Somali community , demonstrating through action that Muslims are not to be feared .\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Fatuma Hussein is founder of the Immigrant Resource Center of Maine , a nonprofit that supports refugees and immigrant communities . \u201c In America , you can be whatever you want to be , \u201d she says .\nFatuma admits her kids are under a lot of pressure . She wants them to earn A \u2019 s . Wants them to get into top colleges . To reflect well on the Somali community . And to be happy , of course . In America , you can be whatever you want to be . She tells them this a lot . But to get there , they have to study and do right . Whenever the topic of drugs comes up , Fatuma tells them she will kill them \u2013 she uses this word \u2013 if they ever get into that kind of trouble . She \u2019 s exaggerating but says , \u201c I \u2019 d rather go to jail than see them having all this privilege and screw it up . \u201d\nFatuma was 11 , visiting relatives , when the Somali civil war erupted in 1991 after the collapse of Mohamed Siad Barre \u2019 s government . Her memories of what happened are fragments : being pressed into the back of a crowded flatbed truck , the truck tipping over , people on the ground , gunshots and smoke , bodies motionless . Fear in Utanga , the refugee camp where she wound up . Heartaching separation from her parents and siblings .\nFor Fatuma that time in Utanga , and the hard years in Atlanta when she arrived there as an adolescent with extended family , background everything . Her kids will have what she did not , and they will play their part in getting there .\nThe lives of Lewiston \u2019 s new immigrants are complex , often delineated by loss . Like Fatuma , Jamilo Maalim was separated from her parents . She was a toddler when militants attacked the family \u2019 s village and relatives fled with her to a refugee camp in Kenya . She lived there eight years . I met Jamilo when she was 22 , or maybe 23 . ( Record keeping , especially during escalations in the war , was haphazard , and many refugees don \u2019 t know their birthdate . ) Her downtown Lewiston apartment was spare but comfortable , decorated with swags of plastic flowers and photos of her daughter and son . The living room held a leatherette sofa and TV , and a soft rug where the family sat to eat their meals .\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Immigrant teenagers play soccer on a basketball court at a park in Lewiston .\nJamilo \u2019 s physical traits \u2013 the set to her chin , upright posture , a warm but searching gaze \u2013 suggest both sensitivity and grit . When she arrived in Lewiston as a 9-year-old , she entered third grade . She was quick \u2013 learned English easily , made friends , loved gym class . Yet she struggled at home , shuttled among relatives who sometimes harshly punished .\nAt 17 she left school and moved to Massachusetts to live with a Somali boy she \u2019 d met online . She named the baby born that fall Aaliyah \u2013 Arabic for ascending . A year later , the relationship dissolved . Jamilo and Aaliyah wound up in a shelter for several months . After Jamilo returned to Lewiston with her daughter , her family pressured her into an arranged marriage . That ended after two years , just after her second child , Hamzah , turned 1 .\nIn spite of the instability , Jamilo kept moving forward . She returned to high school while pregnant with Aaliyah , got promoted to team leader within weeks of a new job , and played on a women \u2019 s soccer team . Almost daily , her extended family pressured her to return to the marriage . She wanted to raise her kids , work , and find a man with whom she could have a marriage that felt mutual . She wanted to sort through her past and choose her future .\n\u201c Inshallah [ God willing ] , someday I will have a happy life , \u201d she told me not long after her marriage broke up .\nGetting to know Lewiston \u2019 s Somali community , with its many strong , independent women , forced me to reevaluate my views on Muslim gender bias . It also made me wonder about what I \u2019 d absorbed \u2013 was still absorbing \u2013 about Islam overall .\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Lula Abdi , originally from Somalia , helps kindergartners at Connor Elementary School learn their letters using clay figures .\nSome Mainers I know describe a reexamination of values that stem from what they see as cultural richness in new immigrants . One Lewiston man put it like this : \u201c My Somali friends changed the way I [ see things ] . What matters are relationships . Material things do not equate with happiness. \u201d His observations resonated with me . For close to two centuries in Maine , my family \u2019 s life revolved around community , family , and faith . The values we abided by resemble the ones many of Lewiston \u2019 s newcomers hold close today .\nA sizable minority of Mainers remains unhappy about the presence of the city \u2019 s newest residents . Lewiston sits in the state \u2019 s 2nd Congressional District . Mr. Trump won here in 2016 , giving him his only electoral vote in New England . The expansion of the city \u2019 s services to include translators and English as a second language instructors is anathema to many , as is coexistence with Islam . In recent years , the region \u2019 s anti-Islam faction has gained momentum and new followers .\nSome Lewistonians blame the newcomers for whatever still feels wrong in the city \u2013 too few living-wage jobs , dilapidated infrastructure , the pockets of poverty that took hold after the mills closed .\nIn truth , and in spite of what some might claim , there have been setbacks along the way \u2013 most recently when several young new immigrants were arrested in connection with the beating death of a man during a fight in the downtown park . That tragedy , which occurred in June 2018 , prompted soul-searching among city leaders along with an investigation that so far has resulted in authorities charging one young person with manslaughter and two others with misdemeanor assault .\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff The Androscoggin River skirts Lewiston , a city of 36,000 that was once a hub of textile and shoe manufacturing .\nBut here \u2019 s the thing : You can view the arrival of Muslim and other African newcomers as part of Lewiston \u2019 s struggles . Or you can see them as the closest thing the city has to a solution .\nPhil Nadeau , the longtime deputy city administrator , was for more than a decade an outspoken advocate of the city \u2019 s rising population of refugees and asylum-seekers . In retirement he \u2019 s creating a website celebrating Lewistonian accord . \u201c I love this place , \u201d he told me of the city where he was born . \u201c I want to make sure we go down on the right side of history . \u201d\nSo much overlays the social landscape through which Fatuma and Jamilo and other new Lewistonians move . On a sunny autumn day in 2016 , Jamilo hosted Aaliyah \u2019 s fourth birthday party at an orchard outside Lewiston . Most of the guests were Somali . Among the tree-lined rows , women hoisted kids onto their shoulders and handed them bags for apples . One woman \u2019 s fianc\u00e9 \u2013 the only male guest \u2013 helped . \u201c So many Eves , only one Adam , \u201d another woman joked .\nAt the cash register , one of Jamilo \u2019 s friends commented that , because they were picking the apples themselves , she \u2019 d thought they were free . The cashier \u2019 s face hardened . \u201c You shouldn \u2019 t take produce you can \u2019 t pay for , \u201d she said .\nJamilo \u2019 s friend protested \u2013 she was paying ; that \u2019 s why she \u2019 d brought her bag of apples to the register . If she didn \u2019 t have enough money , she \u2019 d take some out .\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Immigrants from Egypt , Angola , Burundi , and other nations take an English language class .\n\u201c I didn \u2019 t come here to steal your apples , \u201d the friend said .\nThe cashier glared . The friend swore . The cashier threatened to call the police . Party guests backed away from the register . Jamilo and a friend hurriedly cleaned up the remains of the lasagna they \u2019 d brought .\nThe party wasn \u2019 t ruined . The kids didn \u2019 t overhear the confrontation , and Jamilo shrugged it off . Her friend had a temper ; the cashier was rude . Jamilo had dealt with worse .\nA month later , Mr. Trump won the election . Jamilo texted me the next day . She was shocked by the outcome , she said , and worried for herself and other Muslims . Then she added , \u201c God bless America ! I still love this country ! \u201d That was Wednesday . The next day at noon she left work to go home and make lunch . As she stepped into a crosswalk , a motorist sped past and shouted at her to take off her hijab . Soon afterward Jamilo texted , \u201c I \u2019 m terrified . \u201d\nA few days after the incident , though still shaky , she reiterated her love for the U.S. \u201c This is my home , \u201d she said .\nJamilo never thinks about leaving the U.S. After Mr. Trump was elected , Somali social media lit up with rumors . Muslims would be required to wear identification bracelets . They \u2019 d have to sign a national registry . Muslim men would be monitored .\nIn the past three years , fear among newcomers in Lewiston has flowed and ebbed with the latest pronouncements out of Washington . But these are people who trekked miles across the desert , often under attack , to reach refugee camps where conditions were also perilous . Those who made it to the U.S. did so with a resolve that now characterizes their daily lives .\nI first noticed this stoic reaction to what they considered bad news in the months after the presidential election . The new immigrants I knew worried about what was coming , yes . But there was a sense of continuity and a marked lack of bitterness . People were getting on with things , one man told me . In the months that followed , I saw it : Newcomers were quietly focusing on building their lives \u2013 on getting a new job , taking a college exam , preparing for a new baby .\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Clothing with Somalia labels is popular in stores , like this one on Lisbon Street .\nAnd on unity . \u201c We need to come together . As community , as \u2018 we the people , \u2019 it is our responsibility to fix the divide caused by our political leader , \u201d community leader Abdikadir Negeye wrote in an opinion piece in the Lewiston Sun Journal . By \u201c we the people , \u201d Abdikadir means the state of Maine , the city of Lewiston \u2013 and its new immigrant community .\nBridging differences is keenly personal to Abdikadir . He \u2019 s Somali Bantu , a marginalized ethnic minority . More than 2,000 Bantus live in Lewiston . Most descend from various African tribes whose people were captured and sold during the Indian Ocean slave trade . Even after slavery was abolished in Somalia at the turn of the 20th century , a vast class divide remained .\nDirect yet tender , Abdikadir is married to Ikran , an ethnic Somali woman . He refers to it as a \u201c mixed marriage. \u201d Abdikadir \u2019 s family was OK with the union ; hers pushed back and then relented . Abdikadir says he worried at first , when they were still engaged . But he loved Ikran . Their marriage would work . And so it has .\nIn the debate over the future of immigration in America , refugees and asylum-seekers are generally viewed as victims or as liabilities . Neither view encompasses the way I see new immigrants in Lewiston or the way they seem to see themselves : as initiators and collaborators . The proverb Iskaashato ma kufto \u2013 \u201c If people support one another , they do not fall \u201d \u2013 sums up the African way in Lewiston .\nTools in the new immigrant toolbox include consensus-seeking , de-emphasis on \u201c being right , \u201d and the goal of common understanding . In a public setting \u2013 say , a school committee meeting \u2013 newcomers feel the event should not adjourn until all who wish to speak have had a chance to do so . In part , this approach is cultural and ingrained . In part , it \u2019 s more newly acquired . Infighting \u2013 among clans , among ethnicities \u2013 has intensified Africa \u2019 s civil wars for generations . The newcomers know firsthand the costs of conflict . Those who made it to the U.S. want a fresh start \u2013 not unlike immigrants everywhere throughout the centuries .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox . By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy\nThis much is indisputable : Before the arrival of its asylum-seekers and refugees , Lewiston was one more postindustrial city in slow fade . Now its newcomers are part of who it is \u2013 so too their life stories and their steady forward motion .\nNew immigrant kids in Lewiston are Mainers now . They grew up with snow and the piercing blue of a winter sky . They wear wool hats with their hijabs and go to sleep at night with the nearby Androscoggin flowing beneath the ice .",

More and more she feels like a mandated emissary of the Lewiston Somali community, demonstrating through action that Muslims are not to be feared.\n\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Fatuma Hussein is founder of the Immigrant Resource Center of Maine, a nonprofit that supports refugees and immigrant communities. \u201cIn America, you can be whatever you want to be,\u201d she says.\n\nFatuma admits her kids are under a lot of pressure. She wants them to earn A\u2019s. Wants them to get into top colleges. To reflect well on the Somali community. And to be happy, of course. In America, you can be whatever you want to be. She tells them this a lot. But to get there, they have to study and do right. Whenever the topic of drugs comes up, Fatuma tells them she will kill them \u2013 she uses this word \u2013 if they ever get into that kind of trouble. She\u2019s exaggerating but says, \u201cI\u2019d rather go to jail than see them having all this privilege and screw it up.\u201d\n\nFatuma was 11, visiting relatives, when the Somali civil war erupted in 1991 after the collapse of Mohamed Siad Barre\u2019s government. Her memories of what happened are fragments: being pressed into the back of a crowded flatbed truck, the truck tipping over, people on the ground, gunshots and smoke, bodies motionless. Fear in Utanga, the refugee camp where she wound up. Heartaching separation from her parents and siblings.\n\nFor Fatuma that time in Utanga, and the hard years in Atlanta when she arrived there as an adolescent with extended family, background everything. Her kids will have what she did not, and they will play their part in getting there.\n\nThe lives of Lewiston\u2019s new immigrants are complex, often delineated by loss. Like Fatuma, Jamilo Maalim was separated from her parents. She was a toddler when militants attacked the family\u2019s village and relatives fled with her to a refugee camp in Kenya. She lived there eight years. I met Jamilo when she was 22, or maybe 23. (Record keeping, especially during escalations in the war, was haphazard, and many refugees don\u2019t know their birthdate.) Her downtown Lewiston apartment was spare but comfortable, decorated with swags of plastic flowers and photos of her daughter and son. The living room held a leatherette sofa and TV, and a soft rug where the family sat to eat their meals.\n\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Immigrant teenagers play soccer on a basketball court at a park in Lewiston.\n\nJamilo\u2019s physical traits \u2013 the set to her chin, upright posture, a warm but searching gaze \u2013 suggest both sensitivity and grit. When she arrived in Lewiston as a 9-year-old, she entered third grade. She was quick \u2013 learned English easily, made friends, loved gym class. Yet she struggled at home, shuttled among relatives who sometimes harshly punished.\n\nAt 17 she left school and moved to Massachusetts to live with a Somali boy she\u2019d met online. She named the baby born that fall Aaliyah \u2013 Arabic for ascending. A year later, the relationship dissolved. Jamilo and Aaliyah wound up in a shelter for several months. After Jamilo returned to Lewiston with her daughter, her family pressured her into an arranged marriage. That ended after two years, just after her second child, Hamzah, turned 1.\n\nIn spite of the instability, Jamilo kept moving forward. She returned to high school while pregnant with Aaliyah, got promoted to team leader within weeks of a new job, and played on a women\u2019s soccer team. Almost daily, her extended family pressured her to return to the marriage. She wanted to raise her kids, work, and find a man with whom she could have a marriage that felt mutual. She wanted to sort through her past and choose her future.\n\n\u201cInshallah [God willing], someday I will have a happy life,\u201d she told me not long after her marriage broke up.\n\nGetting to know Lewiston\u2019s Somali community, with its many strong, independent women, forced me to reevaluate my views on Muslim gender bias. It also made me wonder about what I\u2019d absorbed \u2013 was still absorbing \u2013 about Islam overall.\n\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Lula Abdi, originally from Somalia, helps kindergartners at Connor Elementary School learn their letters using clay figures.\n\nSome Mainers I know describe a reexamination of values that stem from what they see as cultural richness in new immigrants. One Lewiston man put it like this: \u201cMy Somali friends changed the way I [see things]. What matters are relationships. Material things do not equate with happiness.\u201d His observations resonated with me. For close to two centuries in Maine, my family\u2019s life revolved around community, family, and faith. The values we abided by resemble the ones many of Lewiston\u2019s newcomers hold close today.\n\nA sizable minority of Mainers remains unhappy about the presence of the city\u2019s newest residents. Lewiston sits in the state\u2019s 2nd Congressional District. Mr. Trump won here in 2016, giving him his only electoral vote in New England. The expansion of the city\u2019s services to include translators and English as a second language instructors is anathema to many, as is coexistence with Islam. In recent years, the region\u2019s anti-Islam faction has gained momentum and new followers.\n\nSome Lewistonians blame the newcomers for whatever still feels wrong in the city \u2013 too few living-wage jobs, dilapidated infrastructure, the pockets of poverty that took hold after the mills closed.\n\nIn truth, and in spite of what some might claim, there have been setbacks along the way \u2013 most recently when several young new immigrants were arrested in connection with the beating death of a man during a fight in the downtown park. That tragedy, which occurred in June 2018, prompted soul-searching among city leaders along with an investigation that so far has resulted in authorities charging one young person with manslaughter and two others with misdemeanor assault.\n\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff The Androscoggin River skirts Lewiston, a city of 36,000 that was once a hub of textile and shoe manufacturing.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: You can view the arrival of Muslim and other African newcomers as part of Lewiston\u2019s struggles. Or you can see them as the closest thing the city has to a solution.\n\nPhil Nadeau, the longtime deputy city administrator, was for more than a decade an outspoken advocate of the city\u2019s rising population of refugees and asylum-seekers. In retirement he\u2019s creating a website celebrating Lewistonian accord. \u201cI love this place,\u201d he told me of the city where he was born. \u201cI want to make sure we go down on the right side of history.\u201d\n\nSo much overlays the social landscape through which Fatuma and Jamilo and other new Lewistonians move. On a sunny autumn day in 2016, Jamilo hosted Aaliyah\u2019s fourth birthday party at an orchard outside Lewiston. Most of the guests were Somali. Among the tree-lined rows, women hoisted kids onto their shoulders and handed them bags for apples. One woman\u2019s fianc\u00e9 \u2013 the only male guest \u2013 helped. \u201cSo many Eves, only one Adam,\u201d another woman joked.\n\nAt the cash register, one of Jamilo\u2019s friends commented that, because they were picking the apples themselves, she\u2019d thought they were free. The cashier\u2019s face hardened. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t take produce you can\u2019t pay for,\u201d she said.\n\nJamilo\u2019s friend protested \u2013 she was paying; that\u2019s why she\u2019d brought her bag of apples to the register. If she didn\u2019t have enough money, she\u2019d take some out.\n\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Immigrants from Egypt, Angola, Burundi, and other nations take an English language class.\n\nThe cashier narrowed her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to steal your apples,\u201d the friend said.\n\nThe cashier glared. The friend swore. The cashier threatened to call the police. Party guests backed away from the register. Jamilo and a friend hurriedly cleaned up the remains of the lasagna they\u2019d brought.\n\nThe party wasn\u2019t ruined. The kids didn\u2019t overhear the confrontation, and Jamilo shrugged it off. Her friend had a temper; the cashier was rude. Jamilo had dealt with worse.\n\nA month later, Mr. Trump won the election. Jamilo texted me the next day. She was shocked by the outcome, she said, and worried for herself and other Muslims. Then she added, \u201cGod bless America! I still love this country!\u201d That was Wednesday. The next day at noon she left work to go home and make lunch. As she stepped into a crosswalk, a motorist sped past and shouted at her to take off her hijab. Soon afterward Jamilo texted, \u201cI\u2019m terrified.\u201d\n\nA few days after the incident, though still shaky, she reiterated her love for the U.S. \u201cThis is my home,\u201d she said.\n\nJamilo never thinks about leaving the U.S. After Mr. Trump was elected, Somali social media lit up with rumors. Muslims would be required to wear identification bracelets. They\u2019d have to sign a national registry. Muslim men would be monitored.\n\nIn the past three years, fear among newcomers in Lewiston has flowed and ebbed with the latest pronouncements out of Washington. But these are people who trekked miles across the desert, often under attack, to reach refugee camps where conditions were also perilous. Those who made it to the U.S. did so with a resolve that now characterizes their daily lives.\n\nI first noticed this stoic reaction to what they considered bad news in the months after the presidential election. The new immigrants I knew worried about what was coming, yes. But there was a sense of continuity and a marked lack of bitterness. People were getting on with things, one man told me. In the months that followed, I saw it: Newcomers were quietly focusing on building their lives \u2013 on getting a new job, taking a college exam, preparing for a new baby.\n\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Clothing with Somalia labels is popular in stores, like this one on Lisbon Street.\n\nAnd on unity. \u201cWe need to come together. As community, as \u2018we the people,\u2019 it is our responsibility to fix the divide caused by our political leader,\u201d community leader Abdikadir Negeye wrote in an opinion piece in the Lewiston Sun Journal. By \u201cwe the people,\u201d Abdikadir means the state of Maine, the city of Lewiston \u2013 and its new immigrant community.\n\nBridging differences is keenly personal to Abdikadir. He\u2019s Somali Bantu, a marginalized ethnic minority. More than 2,000 Bantus live in Lewiston. Most descend from various African tribes whose people were captured and sold during the Indian Ocean slave trade. Even after slavery was abolished in Somalia at the turn of the 20th century, a vast class divide remained.\n\nDirect yet tender, Abdikadir is married to Ikran, an ethnic Somali woman. He refers to it as a \u201cmixed marriage.\u201d Abdikadir\u2019s family was OK with the union; hers pushed back and then relented. Abdikadir says he worried at first, when they were still engaged. But he loved Ikran. Their marriage would work. And so it has.\n\nIn the debate over the future of immigration in America, refugees and asylum-seekers are generally viewed as victims or as liabilities. Neither view encompasses the way I see new immigrants in Lewiston or the way they seem to see themselves: as initiators and collaborators. The proverb Iskaashato ma kufto \u2013 \u201cIf people support one another, they do not fall\u201d \u2013 sums up the African way in Lewiston.\n\nTools in the new immigrant toolbox include consensus-seeking, de-emphasis on \u201cbeing right,\u201d and the goal of common understanding. In a public setting \u2013 say, a school committee meeting \u2013 newcomers feel the event should not adjourn until all who wish to speak have had a chance to do so. In part, this approach is cultural and ingrained. In part, it\u2019s more newly acquired. Infighting \u2013 among clans, among ethnicities \u2013 has intensified Africa\u2019s civil wars for generations. The newcomers know firsthand the costs of conflict. Those who made it to the U.S. want a fresh start \u2013 not unlike immigrants everywhere throughout the centuries.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

Now its newcomers are part of who it is \u2013 so too their life stories and their steady forward motion.\n\nNew immigrant kids in Lewiston are Mainers now. They grew up with snow and the piercing blue of a winter sky. They wear wool hats with their hijabs and go to sleep at night with the nearby Androscoggin flowing beneath the ice.",
