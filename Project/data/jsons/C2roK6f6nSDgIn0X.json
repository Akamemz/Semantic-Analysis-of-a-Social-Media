    "content": "The detritus of the 2016 Republican presidential race is composed of candidates who bet everything on winning the Iowa caucus . Scott Walker , Rick Perry and Bobby Jindal were all , at one point or another , singularly focused on Iowa \u2013 not because that \u2019 s a particularly good strategy , but because they had no other choice . Iowa is the first state to hold a nominating contest , and it \u2019 s jam-packed with white evangelical voters who just love to caucus . If you \u2019 re a hard-right outsider candidate with an unkillable desire to be president , Iowa is your best opportunity to assert yourself and make an impact on the race .\nThe problem with the all-out Iowa-centric strategy is that there are other elections and caucuses after Iowa , and they \u2019 re not all so uniquely white , Christian , conservative and corn-loving as the Hawkeye State .\nThat brings us to Ted Cruz . The Texas senator , I should hasten to point out , is a very different candidate from Walker , Perry and Jindal ; he \u2019 s capable of raising money and his poll numbers are on an upward trajectory . Nowhere is this more evident than in Iowa , where the last two polls have put him in second place , only narrowly trailing Donald Trump . Cruz \u2019 s surge in Iowa makes sense given that the Cruz game plan is essentially to embrace the Iowa-is-everything strategy , but apply it nationally . Cruz \u2019 s path to the White House , as he sees it , is to drive up turnout among white voters and conservative Christians . \u201c Today , roughly half of born again Christians aren \u2019 t voting , \u201d he said at his announcement speech back in March . \u201c They \u2019 re staying home . Imagine instead millions of people of faith all across America coming out to the polls and voting our values . \u201d\nFor the moment , this strategy is reaping dividends in one place where it was likely to , and people are starting to talk about Cruz as a sleeper threat for the nomination . But let \u2019 s be clear : Cruz still faces a mountain of troubles , both inside Iowa and beyond .\nHis most immediate problem in Iowa is Donald Trump , who has been dominating the polls there and appears to have successfully beaten off a challenge from Ben Carson . Cruz \u2019 s rise seems to be coming at Carson \u2019 s expense , but the question is whether he \u2019 ll have more success in knocking Trump out of the top spot . The Cruz strategy relies to a large degree on a Trump collapse \u2013 the candidate and his campaign are upfront about this and are confident that Cruz will catch the majority of Trump \u2019 s supporters if and when they bolt .

Then he runs into the post-Iowa problem of having to win over electorates that aren \u2019 t so overwhelmingly conservative \u2013 a problem that is especially pronounced in non-caucus states . \u201c There is not a single primary state where \u2018 very conservative \u2019 voters represent as large a share of the electorate as they do in Iowa , \u201d the New York Times notes .
