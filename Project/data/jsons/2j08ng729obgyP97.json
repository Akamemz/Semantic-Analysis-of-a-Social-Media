It is not .

And that , essentially , is the position congressional Republicans find themselves in right now , which was made crystal clear in the House on Wednesday , when the vast majority of GOPers voted to repeal President Obama \u2019 s recent unilateral moves to reduce undocumented immigrant deportations . It wasn \u2019 t much of a surprise , then , to see Speaker John Boehner try to frame the vote as having little to do with immigration policy per se , and everything to do with reversing an \u201c executive overreach [ that ] is an affront to the rule of law \u201d and a threat to the Constitution .\nThat said , the vote happened less than 48 hours ago . So , yes , I am a bit taken aback by a report from Politico that shows the Republicans \u2019 facade of Constitution-fetishism and fealty to tradition has already crumbled .

However , their other proposal for how to make a document they usually speak of as nearly biblical in its sanctity even better is newer \u2014 and if it were to be accepted by anyone in the party outside its Tea Party fringe , it would represent a significant nativist shift on immigration from the GOP . It \u2019 s a proposal to tweak that pesky 14th Amendment in order to combat the phantom menace of \u201c anchor babies \u201d and end the long-standing U.S. practice of birthright citizenship . Needless to say , Steve King , the leader of what pro-immigration reform GOP aides derisively call the \u201c boxcar crowd \u201d ( as in , they want to round the nation \u2019 s undocumented immigrants into boxcars for eventual deportation ) , is leading the charge .\nObviously , I \u2019 m not a fan of this ambitious plan to literally change the definition of who is and is not an American .
