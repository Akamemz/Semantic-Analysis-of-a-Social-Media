    "content": "Yesterday , the New York Times ran and \u201c investigative \u201d piece on Ted Cruz \u2019 s finances . I their story they point to an alleged failure by Ted Cruz to report a loan he received to finance his campaign :\nThose reports show that in the critical weeks before the May 2012 Republican primary , Mr. Cruz \u2014 currently a leading contender for his party \u2019 s presidential nomination \u2014 put \u201c personal funds \u201d totaling $ 960,000 into his Senate campaign . Two months later , shortly before a scheduled runoff election , he added more , bringing the total to $ 1.2 million \u2014 \u201c which is all we had saved , \u201d as Mr. Cruz described it in an interview with The New York Times several years ago . A review of personal financial disclosures that Mr. Cruz filed later with the Senate does not find a liquidation of assets that would have accounted for all the money he spent on his campaign . What it does show , however , is that in the first half of 2012 , Ted and Heidi Cruz obtained the low-interest loan from Goldman Sachs , as well as another one from Citibank . The loans totaled as much as $ 750,000 and eventually increased to a maximum of $ 1 million before being paid down later that year . There is no explanation of their purpose . Neither loan appears in reports the Ted Cruz for Senate Committee filed with the Federal Election Commission , in which candidates are required to disclose the source of money they borrow to finance their campaigns . Other campaigns have been investigated and fined for failing to make such disclosures , which are intended to inform voters and prevent candidates from receiving special treatment from lenders . There is no evidence that the Cruzes got a break on their loans .\nSo he got a loan to finance his campaign , he didn \u2019 t get special treatment on the loan , but he failed to report it . But the hypocrisy :\nThere would have been nothing improper about Mr. Cruz obtaining bank loans for his campaign , as long as they were disclosed . But such a disclosure might have conveyed the wrong impression for his candidacy . Mr. Cruz , a conservative former Texas solicitor general , was campaigning as a populist firebrand who criticized Wall Street bailouts and the influence of big banks in Washington . It is a theme he has carried into his bid for the Republican nomination for president . Earlier this year , when asked about the political clout of Goldman Sachs in particular , he replied , \u201c Like many other players on Wall Street and big business , they seek out and get special favors from government . \u201d\nThis is an administrative error that can be fixed by filing an amendment . But the GOP establishment , as reflected through their mouthpiece Jennifer Rubin , thinks this is the silver bullet they were in search of : 10 reasons that Goldman Sachs loan is a nightmare for Ted Cruz .\nThe GOP is lucky to find this out now . Imagine what would happen if the party nominated someone with this to go up against the Clinton attack machine . It \u2019 s one more reason not to nominate someone with such a thin public record who has never been thoroughly vetted .\nRight , like a paper mistake is going to kill a candidate when a federal investigation of the Clinton Foundation won \u2019 t bother Hillary .\nTed Cruz \u2019 s primary runoff against Dewhurst was July 31 , 2012 . He publicly disclosed the margin loan July 9 , 2012. pic.twitter.com/8yyV4zxrV9 \u2014 Phil Kerpen ( @ kerpen ) January 14 , 2016\nAnd the loan had been reported on in the press in 2013\nAs of the end of 2012 , Cruz listed a \u201c Loan to Ted Cruz For Senate \u201d as an asset valued at $ 500,001 to $ 1 million . However , because of the 2002 changes to campaign finance law , the committee is limited to making loan repayments to the candidate ( 1 ) from funds received before an election , or ( 2 ) $ 250,000 from funds received after an election . Because of earlier loan repayments , as of the end of 2012 , the committee could only legally repay the candidate $ 298,000 . This includes $ 48,000 for his outstanding primary election loans , and $ 250,000 for his outstanding runoff election loans . \u2026 Cruz does list on his personal financial disclosure report as liabilities two loans received in 2012 . One was a margin loan of $ 250,001 to $ 500,000 from Goldman Sachs . The other was a line of credit of $ 250,001 to $ 500,000 obtained from Citibank .\nCruz took out the loan before his primary campaign against David Dewhurst . It was disclosed at the time , though apparently not carried forward . It was reported on in the press in 2013 and , to make matters worse , Cruz is going to be left holding the bag for the loan because the election committee can \u2019 t legally repay him . So Rubin \u2019 s fulmination is wrong . And Cruz has explained the circumstances , so it isn \u2019 t like there is deception involved :\nHere \u2019 s what @ tedcruz told reporters tonight in Dorchester , S.C. , about the @ nytimes report on his undisclosed loan : pic.twitter.com/AWtgIYJQp4 \u2014 Patrick Svitek ( @ PatrickSvitek ) January 14 , 2016\nThere are two take aways from this story . The first is that the loan was disclosed during Cruz \u2019 s primary challenge to David Dewhurst . The fact that the loan was not carried forward on his general election documentation is not a deal of any type . The loan was not hidden and Rubin \u2019 s pantie wetting fit over hypocrisy is just as dumb as she is . The law can be complied with by filing an amended report which Cruz has indicated he will do . The second take away is \u201c is this all ya got ? \u201d Really . You investigate a man \u2019 s financial disclosure and the best you can come up with to justify your labor is a loan that was disclosed on one report and not disclosed on a second report but was not improper in any other respect ?\nAnd maybe there is a third . Just how good is the NYT when it misses stuff that is on the internet and can be found via a Google search ? Or did it miss it ?",
