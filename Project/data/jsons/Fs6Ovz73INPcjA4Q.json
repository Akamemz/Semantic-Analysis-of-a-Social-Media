    "content": "Republicans ripped President Obama 's long-awaited budget proposal Wednesday , describing it as a `` reheated '' plan that revives controversial tax hikes in the name of deficit reduction without ever balancing the budget .\nThe 2014 plan , delivered to Congress Wednesday morning , was pitched by Obama as a compromise -- twinning tax increases , which Republicans dislike , with changes to Social Security , which liberal Democrats despise .\n`` I have already met Republicans more than halfway , '' Obama said in the Rose Garden Wednesday .\nBut Republican leaders , while praising the president for proposing a change to curb the growth of Social Security , said they had no interest in agreeing to new tax increases for a budget that would n't balance anyway .\n`` We do n't need an extreme unbalanced budget that wo n't balance in your lifetime or mine , '' Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said on the floor Wednesday .\nThe sentiment was echoed by GOP leaders in the House , who complained about the budget 's abundant red ink -- which would run to nearly $ 5.3 trillion over 10 years .\nHouse Speaker John Boehner accused the White House of trying to hold `` modest '' changes to entitlements `` hostage '' to the call for more tax increases -- which Republicans argue they already conceded to during negotiations over the fiscal crisis late last year .\nHouse Republican Leader Eric Cantor urged Obama to drop the call for tax increases and work together with Republicans on entitlements .\nThe budget claims to reduce the deficit by $ 1.8 trillion over 10 years . But annual deficits would never drop below $ 400 billion in that time , though they do mark an improvement over the $ 1 trillion deficits common during Obama 's first four years in office . The budget projects a deficit for the current year of $ 973 billion , falling to $ 744 billion in 2014 .\nThe budget would also nearly double the federal tax on cigarettes to $ 1.95 per pack . That money would fund a new pre-school program for 4-year-olds .\nThe president 's proposed spending for the 2014 fiscal year , which begins Oct. 1 , would rise 2.5 percent from this year .\nBy including proposals to trim Social Security and Medicare , the government 's two biggest benefit programs , Obama is hoping to entice Republicans to consider tax increases .\nObama called his plan `` a fiscally responsible blueprint for middle class jobs and growth , '' during remarks he made Wednesday morning in the White House Rose Garden .\n`` If you 're serious about deficit reduction , then there 's no excuse to keep these loopholes open , '' he said .\nBut instead of moving Congress nearer a grand bargain , Obama 's proposals so far have managed to anger both the Republicans , who are upset by higher taxes , and Democrats unhappy about cuts to Social Security benefits .\nThe president 's spending and tax plan is two months late . The administration blames the delay on the lengthy negotiations at the end of December and then fights over the resulting March 1 automatic spending cuts .\nThe Obama budget proposal will join competing outlines already approved by the Republican-controlled House and the Democratic-run Senate .\nObama 's plan is not all about budget cuts . It also includes an additional $ 50 billion in spending to fund infrastructure investments , including $ 40 billion in a `` Fix It First '' effort to provide immediate money to repair highways , bridges , transit systems and airports nationwide .\nObama 's budget would also provide $ 1 billion to launch a network of 15 manufacturing innovation institutes across the country , and it earmarks funding to support high-speed rail projects .\nThe president 's plan to establish a program to offer preschool to all 4-year-olds from low- and moderate-income families would be financed by the higher tax on tobacco , which the administration said would raise $ 78 billion over a decade .\nThe administration said its proposals to increase spending would not increase the deficit but rather would be paid for either by increasing taxes or making deeper cuts to other programs .\nAmong the proposed cuts , the administration wants to trim defense spending by an additional $ 100 billion and domestic programs by an extra $ 100 billion over the next decade .\nThe budget proposes cutting $ 400 billion from Medicare and other health care programs over a decade . The cuts would come in a variety of ways , including negotiating better prescription drug prices and asking wealthy seniors to pay more .\nIt would obtain an additional $ 200 billion in savings by scaling back farm subsidies and trimming federal retiree programs .\nThe most sweeping proposal in Obama 's budget is a switch in the way the government calculates the annual cost-of-living adjustments for the millions of recipients of Social Security and other benefits .
