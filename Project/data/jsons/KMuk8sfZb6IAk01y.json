    "content": "One striking thing about the new White House Obamacare promotion campaign is that so far it has n't had much to say about the central focus of Obamacare , which is helping Americans buy affordable health insurance .\nLook at the cases President Obama has highlighted . There are young people who say they have benefited from being allowed to stay on their parents ' health policies until age 26 . There are people suffering from serious illnesses who say they are thankful there will no longer be lifetime caps on insurance benefits . There are stories of people with pre-existing conditions who will be able to purchase coverage .\nObama 's pitch for those features of his national health care scheme is one he could have made -- and did make -- a year , or two years , or three years ago . Indeed , in the years after Obamacare was signed into law in March 2010 , the president and his Democratic allies often stressed the same topics they 're stressing now .\nThe difference , of course , is that the Obamacare exchanges now exist , and Americans have just days to go before a Dec. 23 deadline to purchase coverage that will begin on Jan. 1 , 2014 . And while tens of millions of people are being affected , many negatively , by the changes in insurance markets brought on by Obamacare , the benefits the administration often cites involve far smaller groups of people .\nTake the issue of pre-existing conditions . Beginning a recent press briefing , spokesman Jay Carney said the White House particularly wants to highlight `` the Affordable Care Act 's protections for consumers with pre-existing conditions . '' A short time earlier , Carney claimed that `` up to 129 million Americans who have a pre-existing condition for which they could have been denied coverage or charged more up to now are protected , because denying them coverage is prohibited beginning in 2014 . ''\nThe White House 's numbers are vastly overstated . In 2010 , Rep. Henry Waxman and other Democrats then in control of the House Energy and Commerce Committee tried to determine how many people had been denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition . They did not come up with a definitive number , but they found that in the previous two years , the nation 's four largest for-profit health insurance companies had denied coverage to 651,000 people based on pre-existing conditions .\nAround the same time , conservative analysts James Capretta and Tom Miller examined the issue and noted estimates that the number of Americans who might be denied such coverage was between 2 million and 4 million , and quite possibly far smaller than even the low end of that range . That is a significant number of people , with a real problem that needs addressing . But it 's not 129 million . It 's not even a small fraction of that number .\n`` It 's a very small group in our large country , '' says another conservative analyst , Yuval Levin , `` but the fear of falling into it is a powerful political force . ''\nOne way the Obama administration fed that powerful political force was to exaggerate the problem .\nIndeed , a larger number of people -- perhaps 5 million in the nation 's individual insurance market -- are now facing cancellation of their coverage and far higher premiums and deductibles in the new policies they must purchase . And yet the administration has dismissed them as a tiny part of the U.S. population . `` It 's a relatively small number of people in the overall scheme of things , '' Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said last month .\nWhat is indisputable is that the aspects of Obamacare the White House cites most often in its promotional campaign -- the pre-existing conditions policy , or the estimated 3.4 million young Americans who can stay on their parents ' coverage until age 26 -- involve numbers that are far smaller than the tens of millions of people who will likely face steeper costs , nearly unpayable deductibles and sharply limited doctor choices under Obamacare . ( In addition to the 10-million person individual market , some experts believe such problems are coming soon to the 45-million person small-group market . )\nAnd that is why the White House sales campaign focuses on the same things Democrats said in 2009 , and 2010 , and 2011 , and 2012 . Back then , the burdens of Obamacare had not yet become a reality for most Americans . Now they have , and the administration does not have a good answer for the millions who will struggle under the new system . No wonder the president is talking about something else .",
