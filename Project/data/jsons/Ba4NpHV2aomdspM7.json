Gathering intelligence on perhaps the world \u2019 s most secretive , suspicious and difficult-to-read country is incredibly difficult .

But there is also plenty of blame leveled in South Korea at efforts there .\nSupporters of South Korea \u2019 s liberal government , which remains eager for inter-Korean engagement , lament the previous decade of conservative rule , when exchanges between diplomats , government and business leaders , aid groups and others stopped under hard-line policies toward North Korea \u2019 s nuclear ambitions . This , they say , deprived spies of high-quality information sources .\nConservatives , meanwhile , blame liberals for supposedly downsizing espionage operations while pursuing inter-Korean rapprochement . They say such networks have been difficult to rebuild .\nSouth Korea \u2019 s government has repeatedly played down unconfirmed media reports that Kim is in fragile health following heart surgery , saying it has detected no unusual activity in North Korea or any emergency preparation by its ruling Workers \u2019 Party , military and Cabinet . Without specifying its sources , South Korea \u2019 s presidential office said it believes Kim is handling state affairs normally at an unspecified site outside the capital , Pyongyang .\nU.S. President Donald Trump told reporters Monday that he has a \u201c very good idea \u201d about Kim \u2019 s health but couldn \u2019 t talk about it and wished him well .\n\u201c I do know how he \u2019 s doing , relatively speaking , \u201d Trump said at the White House . \u201c You \u2019 ll probably be hearing in the not-too-distant future . \u201d\nSome experts say South Korea , as well as its regional neighbors and ally Washington , must begin preparing for high-level instability that could come if Kim is sidelined by health problems or even dies .
