Republicans mainly vote with Trump because Trump mainly agrees with them on a broad range of public policy issues \u2014 especially the desirability of cutting taxes , reducing social assistance , regulating businesses and gun owners less stringently , and trying to make abortion illegal \u2014 and they still agree with him on those policies , no matter what he says about Charlottesville .\nBut that agreement doesn \u2019 t give Republicans a free pass for inaction .
