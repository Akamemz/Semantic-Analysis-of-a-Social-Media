    "content": "A progressive correspondent asks : \u201c If you were drafting the Constitution in 2017 , would you include the Second Amendment ? \u201d\nIt \u2019 s an ignorant question , but one that was asked in good faith , and the answer may be illuminating to some of our friends who are mystified by conservative thinking on the question .\nThe short answer is : Yes , of course a 21st-century Bill of Rights should codify the right to keep and bear arms . The document does not create the right ; the right precedes the document , which merely recognizes it and ensures that the government is constrained when , inevitably , its all-too-human members are tempted to violate that right .\nProgressives take a tabula rasa view of the human condition , the human animal , the human experience , and human society . In this view human beings , individually and corporately , can be shaped into . . . whatever we desire to shape them into . Rights , in this understanding , come from the state : We decide together , through democratic and other political means , what rights and obligations people are to have , and the state acts ( in theory ) as our instrument in that matter . If you take that view , then the progressive attitude toward the right to keep and bear arms \u2014 that it is more trouble than it is worth and that it therefore should be reduced or eliminated altogether \u2014 is entirely understandable .\nConservatives take a different view , one that is rooted in the nation \u2019 s foundational philosophy . The American premise is a theological premise : that all men are endowed by their Creator \u2014 not the state \u2014 with certain unalienable rights . For our Founding Fathers , who were steeped in the Anglo-Protestant liberal tradition , this was not only the truth but the \u201c self-evident \u201d truth . The right to keep and bear arms , like the right to speak one \u2019 s mind , worship as one sees fit , and petition the state for redress of grievances , is not the king \u2019 s gift to give or to withhold \u2014 the matter was settled by no less an authority than God Himself . For those who are not of a religious cast of mind , the same conclusion can be arrived at through the tradition of natural law and natural rights , which the Christian liberals of the 18th century understood as complementary to their discernment of Divine intent . Whether one believes that man was created by God or by evolutionary processes , the conclusion ends up being the same : Man has reason , individual and corporate dignity , individual and corporate value , and these are not subject to revision by any prince , power , or potentate .\nPut another way : The right to keep and bear arms would still be there without the Second Amendment . Like the right not to suffer political or religious repression , it exists with or without the law . It is an aspect of the human being , not an aspect of the governments that human beings institute among themselves . The state does not grant the right \u2014 the state exists because the right exists and needs protecting from time to time . The state protects our rights from criminals and marauders , and the Constitution protects our rights from their protectors .\nNo doubt that sounds like a lot of crazy talk to many of our progressive friends . \u201c Rights from God ! Imagine ! \u201d That is a critical failure of our most progressive institution , the schools , which consistently neglect \u2014 or decline \u2014 to provide our students with even a rudimentary education in American civics and the history of the American idea . It isn \u2019 t that the modern left-winger is obliged to accept the intellectual and philosophical basis of the American order , but he ought to understand that things are the way they are for a reason . The idea that the Second Amendment could simply be repealed \u2014 that \u2019 s that ! \u2014 isn \u2019 t only an attack on the right to keep and bear arms : It is an attack on the American constitutional order per se . That our progressive friends often are so pristinely ignorant of the moral order underpinning the American Founding is one of their great intellectual failures . They do not understand the American idea , and , as a result , they do not really understand their own ideas , either .\nWhy did the Founders care so deeply about the right to keep and bear arms , to such an extent that they put it on equal footing with freedom of speech and freedom from arbitrary government violence ? That \u2019 s a complicated question . There were concerns unique to the Founding era , among them the libertarian dread of standing armies . Without a permanent military , the ability of the people to organize quickly and effectively against threats foreign and domestic was essential . One possible threat was that of tyrannical domestic government , something that weighed heavily on the minds of the Founders , who knew Roman history . ( To say nothing of English history ! ) Our modern progressive friends scoff at the notion that the Second Amendment could really allow ordinary Americans to frustrate the tyrannical ambitions of a modern federal government with the modern U.S. military \u2014 gunships , nukes , and all \u2014 at its command . That \u2019 s probably true , though one need not be a sophisticated military tactician to appreciate the fact that the mighty America military has been bogged down for 15 years in Afghanistan , unable to tame a raggedy gang of modestly armed rustics \u2014 there is more to warfare than armaments .\nWhy did the Founders care so deeply about the right to keep and bear arms , to such an extent that they put it on equal footing with freedom of speech and freedom from arbitrary government violence ?\nBut there is much , much more to that question than revolutionary fantasies .
