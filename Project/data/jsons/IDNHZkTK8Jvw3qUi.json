    "content": "Former Virginia Gov . Bob McDonnell and his wife , Maureen , were indicted Tuesday on federal corruption charges stemming from their relationship with a wealthy businessman in a case sure to test the ethical boundaries between friendship and political influence .\nFormer health supplement company executive Jonnie R. Williams Sr. plied the McDonnells with gifts and loans and , in return , received access in order to peddle his products , charging documents filed Tuesday claim .\nMr. McDonnell on Tuesday night reiterated that he did nothing wrong \u2014 Virginia law does not require the disclosure of gifts to family members \u2014 and insisted that the gifts were motivated by nothing more than friendship .\nBut now the former governor and first lady face 14 federal charges , including conspiracy to defraud citizens of Virginia and obtaining property under color of official right .\nMr. McDonnell also was charged with giving a false statement to a credit union for neglecting to mention a $ 50,000 loan from Mr. Williams . Mrs. McDonnell faces a charge of obstructing an official proceeding for attempting to return to Mr. Williams some items of clothing he bought for her after an investigation had begun .\nThe McDonnells were scheduled to make an initial court appearance in U.S. District Court in Richmond on Friday . If convicted , each could face a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison and hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines .\nThe 43-page indictment also seeks the forfeiture of more than $ 140,000 as well as dozens of gifts received by the McDonnells , including a silver Rolex watch engraved with the phrase \u201c 71st Governor of Virginia , \u201d several pairs of high-end Louis Vuitton shoes , a slew of golf apparel and equipment and 30 boxes of Anatabloc \u2014 the signature product of Star Scientific .\nProsecutors said that , in exchange for gifts and loans , Mr. McDonnell arranged meetings for Mr. Williams with Virginia government officials , hosting and attending events at the governor \u2019 s mansion designed to promote Mr. Williams \u2018 product among government officials and industry researchers .\nA defiant Mr. McDonnell on Tuesday night addressed the charges before reporters at a Richmond law firm , presenting himself as someone who has been \u201c falsely and wrongly accused and whose public service has been wrongly attacked . \u201d\n\u201c While I deeply regret accepting these legal gifts and loans from Mr. Williams , all of these now have been returned or repaid with interest , \u201d he said in a seven-minute statement . \u201c I have apologized for my poor judgment and I accept full responsibility for accepting these legal gifts and loans . \u201d\nThe former governor cited two \u201c independent and nonpolitical investigations have confirmed that Mr. Williams and Star Scientific received nothing from the state. \u201d He said the charges stem from a \u201c misguided \u201d legal theory that would suggest that facilitating an introduction or arranging a meeting is a federal crime if it involves a political donor or someone who gave someone a gift .\n\u201c I will use every available resource and advocate that I have for as long as it takes to fight and prevail against these false allegations and the unjust overreach of the federal government , \u201d said Mr. McDonnell , who appeared alongside his wife and daughter and did not take questions afterward .\nThe indictment put Mrs. McDonnell firmly at the center of the case , facilitating contact between the governor and the wealthy businessman . It details how , after Mr. Williams dropped more than $ 18,000 on an April 13 , 2011 , shopping trip for her in New York City , she ensured that Mr. Williams was seated next to the governor during a Union League Club event that evening .\nThe indictment also spotlighted Mrs. McDonnell \u2019 s request that Mr. Williams foot the bill for an Oscar de la Renta dress to wear at her husband \u2019 s January 2010 inauguration .\nA McDonnell staffer expressed concern over the prospect of Mr. Williams purchasing the dress for Mrs. McDonnell , causing her to decline the offer but to take a \u201c rain check . \u201d\nThe first lady responded in an email that contained a candid disclosure of the McDonnells \u2019 personal financial situation as they moved into the governor \u2019 s mansion .\n\u201c I need to talk to you about Inaugural clothing budget . I need answers and Bob is screaming about the thousands I \u2019 m charging up in credit card debt , \u201d Mrs. McDonnell wrote to the unidentified staffer . \u201c We are broke , have an unconscionable amount in credit card debt already , and this Inaugural is killing us ! ! \u201d\nOver the course of the next two years , the first couple continued to publicly support Star Scientific . Mrs. McDonnell flew on Mr. Williams \u2018 private jet to a Star Scientific event in Florida within weeks of striking a deal for the family to borrow $ 50,000 from Mr. Williams . During the same period , Mr. Williams provided the family $ 15,000 to pay for wedding expenses for the McDonnells \u2019 daughter , the indictment states .\nMr. Williams is not named in the indictment , but descriptions of a \u201c JW \u201d match publicly known accounts of his relationship with the McDonnells .\nThe charges were the outgrowth of an investigation into the former executive mansion chef , who was fired in early 2012 after he was accused of stealing food from the mansion kitchen .
