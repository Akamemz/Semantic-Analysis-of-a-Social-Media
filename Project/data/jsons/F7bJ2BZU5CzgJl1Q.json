In his opening statement , Major Hasan , who has long sought to declare his guilt , said that `` the evidence will clearly show that I am the shooter . ''\nHasan is accused opening fire at a training center , killing 13 and injuring scores of others . He was shot by a responding police officer , and is now partly paralyzed from that injury .\nThough there is little suspense about the final verdict , the trial \u2013 which could last months \u2013 is important to the military-justice system , to the victims and their families , and to the still-unresolved question of whether the attack was an act of terrorism .

Tara Osborn , the presiding judge , has gone to great lengths to make sure the verdict and sentence in this trial survive any appeals . For example , in the long run up to the much-delayed trial , Hasan pleaded with the court to let him acknowledge his guilt , but Colonel Osborn , denied that request , given that the prosecution is seeking the death penalty .

Now victims face the prospect of taking the stand to explain what they saw , and then being cross-examined by man on trial for unleashing the fury of bullets against them .\nOsborn 's ruling that Hasan can defend himself has been widely seen as an insult to survivors and the families of those who died . Delays in the trial have also worn on possible witnesses and the broader military community in Texas and beyond .\nYet at least some of the 30 victims scheduled to testify say they are anxious to help convict a man they see as a traitor .\n`` I 'm not going to dread anything . That 's a sign of fear , '' injured Staff Sgt . Alonzo Lunsford told the Associated Press . `` That man strikes no fear in my heart . He strikes no fear in my family . What he did to me was bad . But the biggest mistake that he made was I survived . So he will see me again . ''\nOn its first day , the trial shed light on the motives for the attack .
