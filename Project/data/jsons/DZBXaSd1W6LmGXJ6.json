ET ] It 's the end of a busy morning of momentous rulings from the Supreme Court . We 're still working on getting analysis on and reaction to the two landmark decisions that will impact marriage between same-sex couples in the United States and we 'll bring that to you on CNN.com , CNN 's mobile apps and CNN TV .\nWe 'll sign off this live blog now , thanks for reading . Here are links to more of the coverage we already have :\nOur main story : Supreme Court rulings on same-sex marriage hailed as historic victory\nDetails on the DOMA case : Supreme Court strikes down federal provision on same-sex marriage benefits\nDetails on the Proposition 8 case : Supreme Court dismisses California 's Proposition 8 appeal\nFrom CNN Money : The financial impact of the same-sex marriage ruling\n[ Updated at 11:49 a.m . ET ] Religion and marriage are intricately tied together for many and our Belief blog co-editor Daniel Burke has got a range of reaction from believers and non-believers .\nFormer Arkansas Gov . Mike Huckabee is one of those looking at the decisions through a religion lens :\n5 people in robes said they are bigger than the voters of CA and Congress combined.And bigger than God.May He forgive us all . \u2014\n[ Updated at 11:43 a.m . ET ] Both the decisions affecting same-sex marriage were 5-4 splits . And the dissenting justices put out some strong opinions of their own .\nFew public controversies touch an institution so central to the lives of so many , and few inspire such attendant passion by good people on both sides . Few public controversies will ever demonstrate so vividly the beauty of what our Framers gave us , a gift the Court pawns today to buy its stolen moment in the spotlight : a system of government that permits us to rule ourselves . Some will rejoice in today 's decision , and some will despair at it ; that is the nature of a controversy that matters to much to so many . But the Court has cheated both sides , robbing the winners of an honest victory , and the losers of the peace that comes from a fair defeat . We owed both of them better . I dissent .\nWhat the Court fails to grasp or accept is the basic premise of the initiative process . And it is this . The essence of democracy is that the right to make law rests in the people and flows to the government , not the other way around . Freedom resides first in the people without need of a grant from government . The California initiative process embodies these principles and has done so for over a century ... In California and the 26 other States that permit initiatives and popular referendums , the people have exercised their own inherent sovereign right to govern themselves . The Court today frustrates that choice .\n[ Updated at 11:35 a.m . ET ] Kris Perry , one of the key figures in the Proposition 8 case , said it was a victory not just for couples wanting to wed but also children . `` No matter where you live , no matter who your parents are , no matter what kind of family you 're in , you are equal , you are as good as your friends ' parents and your friends . ''\nShe added : `` We can go back to California and say to our own children - all four of our boys - your family is just as good as everybody else 's family . ''\n[ Updated at 11:20 a.m .

''\nHe concluded : \u201c What is inevitable is that the male and female relationship will continue to be uniquely important to the future of society . The reality is that society needs children , and children need a mom and a dad . We will continue to work to restore and promote a healthy marriage culture , which will maximize the chances of a child being raised by a married mother and father . \u201d\n[ Updated at 11:08 a.m . ET ] The Human Rights Campaign , which has pushed for LGBT equality , is declaring two `` monumental victories . '' Here 's the top of their statement :\nIn recent years , California \u2019 s Proposition 8 and the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act became symbols of anti-LGBT discrimination around the country and around the world . Today , both crumbled .\nIn a watershed moment in the fight for equality , the United States Supreme Court today ruled to return marriage equality to California and to strike down DOMA . The court ruled in the Prop 8 case on procedural grounds , not reaching a decision on the merits of Prop 8 or the broader question of whether the Constitution guarantees the fundamental right to marry the person you love .\nMarriages in California are expected to begin again soon . While a joyous milestone , these victories nonetheless throw into sharp relief the uneven progress for LGBT people around the country\u2014a landscape where states like California are rapidly advancing toward equality , but progress in many other places remains stagnant .\n[ Updated at 11:05 a.m . ET ] A little more detail on exactly what the Proposition 8 decision by the Supreme Court means : By dismissing the case , the decision will allow for the lower court decision in California that allows for same-sex marriage to be reinstated .

ET ] Here 's what Hollywood is saying - some reactions from celebrities , many of whom have campaigned for gay rights .\nRemember the old days when # DOMA was around and gay people could n't get married in California ? Crazy right ! ? \u2014\n# DOMA IS DEAD ! ! ! # SCOTUS has done the right thing , and now the love of my life and I can get our constitutionally guarunteed rights ! Wahooo ! \u2014\nToday marks a watershed moment in history and a tremendous victory for the principle of equality . The 5-4 decision by our Supreme Court striking down DOMA affirms the universality of love\u2013the desire of all people not only to find , but to value and affirm , a lifelong commitment to another person . I have lived nearly four score years , and have borne witness to both the heartbreak and promise of true justice and equality in America . Today my heart soars , and my faith in the promise of our great nation is renewed . Now , if there 's anything we gays know how to do well , it is to celebrate ! Let the joy of this day ring out with PRIDE .\n[ Updated at 10:47 a.m .

ET ] So what 's your reaction to the rulings today ?\n[ Updated at 10:38 a.m .

ET ] Same-sex marriage can resume in California - that 's the result of the Supreme Court ruling just in that dismisses an appeal regarding California 's Proposition 8 .\nThe Supreme Court has dismissed a closely-watched appeal over same-sex marriage on jurisdictional grounds , ruling Wednesday private parties do not have `` standing '' to defend California 's voter-approved ballot measure barring gay and lesbians couples from state-sanctioned wedlock . The ruling permits same-sex couples in California to legally marry . The 5-4 decision avoids for now a sweeping conclusion on whether same-sex marriage is a constitutionally-protected `` equal protection '' right that would apply to all states . The case is Hollingsworth v. Perry ( 12-144 ) .\n[ Updated at 10:30 a.m . ET ] New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman told CNN the ruling was a `` great win . '' `` \u201c A great win not just for the gay community , it \u2019 s a great win for the American tradition of equal justice under the law , \u201d he said .\n[ Updated at 10:29 a.m .

ET ] Supporters of same-sex marriage waiting outside the Supreme Court cheered the DOMA decision . Reaction is also coming in from Twitter .\nDNC chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said that `` finally '' all married couples would get benefits .\nFinally , married couples will enjoy the federal benefits and protections they 've been denied for years . # DOMA # SCOTUS \u2014\n[ Updated at 10:15 a.m . ET ] Of course we ca n't draw any conclusions from the DOMA ruling about which way the justices will decide on California 's Proposition 8 .\n[ Updated at 10:12 a.m . ET ] The justices were split 5-4 . The majority ruling was written by Justice Anthony Kennedy . Dissents were written by Chief Justice John Roberts , Justice Antonin Scalia and Justice Samuel Alito .\n[ Updated at 10:09 a.m . ET ] Legal expert Jeffrey Toobin puts the ruling in context : `` DOMA is gone . ''\n[ Updated at 10:08 a.m . ET ] From our team in Washington :\nThe Supreme Court has struck down a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act , ruling that same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits .\n[ Updated at 10:06 a.m . ET ] This is the case where Edie Windsor said she had to pay more in inheritance tax than warranted because her spouse was a woman not a man .\n[ Updated at 10:02 a.m . ET ] We 're reading the decision to see how the justices ruled regarding the rights of legally married same-sex couples to receive federal benefits provided to heterosexual spouses .\n[ Updated at 10:01 a.m .

But will it have had any impact on the nine justices ?\nLet 's go DOMA . Supreme Court lets make history & stand for MARRIAGE EQUALITY ! # GetItDoneThisWeek # TheWhole WorldIsWatching \u2014\n[ Updated at 9:50 a.m .

ET ] While we 're waiting for the opinions to be delivered , here 's Donna Brazile 's take on yesterday 's landmark ruling on the Voting Rights Act . The Democratic strategist says it 's time for President Obama and Congress to pass a new Voting Rights Act .\n[ Updated at 9 : 40 a.m . ET ] A quick reminder that you can watch our reporting live on CNN TV as well as refreshing this page and staying with CNN on CNN.com and our mobile apps .\n[ Updated at 9:19 a.m . ET ] Large crowds are gathering outside the Supreme Court in Washington D.C. and on social media . Right now we can see rainbow gay pride banners and blue flags with a yellow `` = '' sign that is a standard of those fighting for more rights for same-sex couples . Not in view are groups who support traditional marriage between a man and a woman , but that 's not to say they 're not there . Both sides were strongly represented when the Supreme Court heard the arguments back in March .\nOn Twitter , # DOMA will probably start trending soon . There 's certainly a lot of people tweeting about the Supreme Court today .\nThe Tie the Knot organization that wants marriage equality tweeted `` The big day is here . ''\nWe 've gone red to show our support for marriage equality . Read more about what 's at stake at # SCOTUS : glaad.org/marriage \u2014\nOr that the Family Research Council is backing traditional unions .\nMarriage brings a man and woman together as husband and wife to be father and mother to any children their union produces . # 1m1w \u2014\nOdd : in spring , it looked like Prop 8 was the big case ; today , stakes appear higher on DOMA . # scotus # 10amtoday \u2014\n[ Posted at 9:05 a.m . ET ] It 's set to be the last public day of the Supreme Court session , and we 're waiting for opinions in three cases - two of which address same-sex marriage .\nIt 's widely expected that we 'll get rulings on the federal Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) and California 's Proposition 8 , and those rulings could affect the lives , rights and finances of millions of Americans .\nCNN Supreme Court producer Bill Mears writes that DOMA , passed in 1996 , defines marriage as between one man and one woman for federal purposes , like taxes . `` That means the estimated 120,000 gay and lesbian couples legally married in nine states and the District of Columbia are still considered - in the eyes of DOMA opponents - the equivalent of girlfriend and boyfriend . ''\nThat meant that Edie Windsor faced a hefty bill for inheritance taxes when her partner of 42 years died . She claimed in court that she had had to pay $ 363,053 more than if her spouse , thea Spyer , had been a man .\nBut Mears points out that the DOMA issue is more than just a financial question :\nThe larger debate over DOMA 's intent and impact 17 years after passage has driven a wedge between the executive and legislative branches . At issue is what role the federal government should play when it comes to marriage - something states have traditionally controlled .\nThe other key case expected to be decided today considers Proposition 8 . `` In the 'Prop 8 ' case , the high court is being asked to establish a constitutional 'equal protection ' right . It is the kind of hot-button issue that will define our society , our laws , our views on family , '' Mears writes .",

She claimed in court that she had had to pay $363,053 more than if her spouse, thea Spyer, had been a man.\n\nBut Mears points out that the DOMA issue is more than just a financial question:\n\nThe larger debate over DOMA's intent and impact 17 years after passage has driven a wedge between the executive and legislative branches. At issue is what role the federal government should play when it comes to marriage - something states have traditionally controlled.\n\nThe other key case expected to be decided today considers Proposition 8. \"In the 'Prop 8' case, the high court is being asked to establish a constitutional 'equal protection' right. It is the kind of hot-button issue that will define our society, our laws, our views on family,\" Mears writes.",
