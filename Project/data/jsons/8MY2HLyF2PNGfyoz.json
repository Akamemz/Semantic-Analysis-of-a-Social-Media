Mr. Gates is leading the legal battle for the city in its fight with the state over a housing mandate and the `` sanctuary state '' law .\nExtreme minority status is a common condition in divided America . According to Ballotpedia , a single party has an absolute grip on power in 19 states , controlling the governorship as well as veto-proof majorities , or supermajorities , in their legislatures . Democrats are powerless minorities in 16 such states , while Republicans are completely shut out in California , Oregon , and Illinois . Last month , Republican state senators in Oregon fled to Idaho to deny Democrats a quorum \u2013 and a vote \u2013 on a sweeping climate-change bill . The bill petered out , much to the delight of Republicans .\nWisconsin state Sen. Jon Erpenbach had a similar experience , though it didn \u2019 t end as well . In 2011 , he and 13 fellow Senate Democrats went into exile in Illinois for three weeks in order to delay consideration of a major anti-union bill . The bill was being pushed by then-Gov . Scott Walker and the Republican-dominated legislature . Ultimately , the bill became law .\nAs a voiceless minority , \u201c you feel very , very disenfranchised , \u201d says Mr. Erpenbach . \u201c You use every possible parliamentary tool to stop what they do , and 9 times out of 10 , you lose . \u201d\nWhat distresses Mr. Erpenbach most is that Wisconsin is overall a purple state \u2013 but that parity is not reflected in the legislature because of gerrymandered voting districts . Voters last year elected a Democrat as a governor , restoring \u201c balance \u201d in government , as Mr. Erpenbach puts it , but not before the GOP legislature used a lame-duck session to restrict the incoming governor \u2019 s powers .\n\u201c Whether it \u2019 s the Democrats in a supermajority or the Republicans in a supermajority , it seems like the parties are just more concerned about 50.1 % of the people \u2013 [ that ] enough people will elect them and keep them in a majority , \u201d says Mr. Erpenbach .\nAs in California , the minority party in Wisconsin turned to the courts to try to remedy partisan redistricting and the diminished governorship . They \u2019 ve lost on both counts . Mr. Erpenbach says Democrats have no choice but to continue \u201c plugging away \u201d at the redistricting message , educating voters so that when representatives go home , they hear about it .\nRepublicans in California , meanwhile , can \u2019 t agree on how to restore their voice . It \u2019 s been a long decline \u2013 precipitated , many observers believe , by Republican Gov . Pete Wilson in the 1990s . He went against demographic trends and pushed anti-immigration measures . In the short term , it won him reelection , but it also drove Latinos into the arms of Democrats . Other factors also came into play , but with white people now a minority in California and Donald Trump in the White House , Republicans are struggling in this deeply blue state .\nThe state GOP needs to \u201c stop fighting the culture wars \u201d and instead present itself as a more \u201c mainstream \u201d party that focuses on pocketbook issues , as well as education and the environment , says Bill Whalen , former speechwriter for Governor Wilson . Republican consultant Mike Madrid blasts California Republicans for their \u201c silence \u201d on President Trump \u2019 s \u201c racist tweets \u201d about four Democratic women of color in the House .\nOn the other hand , Fred Whitaker , chairman of the Republican Party of Orange County , rejects the idea that Republicans should adjust their ideology .\n\u201c You can \u2019 t become the Democratic Party lite , \u201d he says . Many Asians and Latinos are socially conservative , but fiscally liberal when it comes to larger government , he says . \u201c Our job is to talk with every voter where they are , who align with our values , and see if we can \u2019 t bring them across. \u201d The party must also field more candidates who look like the neighborhoods they come from , he says .\nHe and others believe that the state is headed for a financial crisis . It may have a surplus now , but it relies on high income taxes , and when the next recession hits , they say voters will see the error of their ways .\n\u201c Voters wanted a Democratic majority in statewide offices and in the legislature \u201d \u2013 and now they have a high-tax state , with rising gas taxes and the highest rate of poverty in the nation , says Republican state Sen. John Moorlach , who represents Huntington Beach . \u201c When a recession hits , it \u2019 s not going to be pretty . \u201d\nCalifornia \u2019 s Democrats won supermajority status last November . But Mr. Moorlach says he \u2019 s \u201c not complaining \u201d about his new situation . \u201c It is what it is , que sera , sera . \u201d\nAnd he says at least Democrats have allowed him to have a voice , whether in committee or on the Senate floor . As vice chair of the powerful Energy , Utilities , and Communications Committee , he realizes he \u2019 s \u201c pretty much a figurehead , \u201d but he still contributes . Votes tend not to go the way he wants , but he has a chance to put things on record .\nIt \u2019 s not completely hopeless for Republicans , adds Marcia Godwin , a government expert at the University of La Verne in La Verne , California . Sometimes , bipartisan coalitions form in Sacramento when the liberal wing of the Democratic Party won \u2019 t go along , she says .
