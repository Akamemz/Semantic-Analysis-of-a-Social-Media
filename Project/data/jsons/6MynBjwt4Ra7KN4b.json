Pelosi had boasted going into the vote that she had support from two-thirds of the caucus , and she received just over that amount .\nPelosi , 76 , has held the top slot in House Democratic leadership since 2003 . She became the first female speaker of the House in history when Democrats won control of Congress in 2006 .

Ryan 's 63 votes is the most serious defection she has faced .\nThe debate over who was best to lead the House Democrats , who are now entering their sixth year in the minority , was emblematic of the larger debate over the direction of the party after Hillary Clinton suffered a surprising and stinging loss in the presidential race to Donald Trump . House Democrats had hoped to pick up as many as 15 or 20 seats to cut into Republicans ' 30-seat edge .
