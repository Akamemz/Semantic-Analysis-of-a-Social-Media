Had Justice Antonin Scalia , who died in February , still been on the court , Mr. Obama would likely have lost in a 5-4 decision that could have spanked him on broad constitutional grounds and imposed limits on future presidents , analysts said .\nInstead , the tie decision leaves in place rulings by a district judge in Texas and by the 5th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals that Mr. Obama broke the law when he claimed he had the categorical power to grant \u201c deferred action \u201d to nearly half of the illegal immigrants in the country .\nRepublicans hailed it as a blow to Mr. Obama \u2019 s expansive claims of power , saying the court restored some of the balance that the country \u2019 s founders envisioned in the Constitution .\nSEE ALSO : In wake of ruling , immigrant activists demand Obama stop all deportations\n\u201c The Supreme Court \u2019 s ruling makes the president \u2019 s executive action on immigration null and void . The Constitution is clear : The president is not permitted to write laws \u2014 only Congress is . This is another major victory in our fight to restore the separation of powers , \u201d said House Speaker Paul D. Ryan , the Wisconsin Republican who is leading a similar lawsuit against Obamacare .\nMr. Obama was not cowed . He said the justices never reached the big issues of the case , so it doesn \u2019 t affect any of his other policies , such as global warming and Obamacare .\nHe said he will abide by the ruling , effectively ending his plans for the DAPA program . But he said most of those who would have qualified still won \u2019 t be deported because they are likely to have ties to the community and relatively clean criminal records .\nHispanic rights groups vowed to make Republicans pay at the ballot box in November . They said the clearest way for illegal immigrants to gain legal status is to elect lawmakers who support a path to citizenship .\n\u201c This act of cruelty delivered on immigrants by the Republican Party will serve as another watershed moment in the complete collapse of Latino and immigrant support for the GOP and its candidates , \u201d said Kica Matos , director of immigrant rights at the Center for Community Change Action . \u201c Our movement gets stronger when faced with anti-immigrant attacks . We expect the decision to be another factor in record Latino and pro-immigrant voter turnout in 2016 . \u201d\nJustices didn \u2019 t release an opinion in the deadlock , and they don \u2019 t say who voted on which side of the question \u2014 though based on oral arguments , it \u2019 s fairly certain the four justices appointed by Democratic presidents sided with the administration and the Republican-appointed justices sided with Texas .\nTexas argued that the program forced it to issue driver \u2019 s licenses to illegal immigrants and to pay for education and health care benefits that the illegal immigrants would also be entitled to under DAPA .\nThey said the DAPA program broke federal procedural law because it was a major policy change never put out for public comment , that it broke immigration law by granting legal status to too many people and that it violated the president \u2019 s constitutional limits on power .\nU.S. District Judge Andrew S.
