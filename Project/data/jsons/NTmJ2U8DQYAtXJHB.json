And it was a missed opportunity for the media as well .\nTrump , as is well known , always needs an enemy . With Hillary leaking excerpts from her forthcoming book , with Alec Baldwin on summer hiatus , with Mitch McConnell telling associates he wonders if Trump will make it ( at least according to the NYT ) , the press is his main punching bag .\nThe president \u2019 s message comes down to this : the media treat me with monstrous unfairness , they are also unfair to you , and they view you with condescension .\nThat \u2019 s fair game , but here \u2019 s why this attack did nothing to expand his base or further his agenda .\nJust 24 hours earlier , Trump had given a generally well-received speech on sending more troops to Afghanistan , and won some media plaudits for the deliberative nature of the consultations with his generals . Slamming the press ( along with John McCain , Jeff Flake and dangling a pardon for Joe Arpaio ) booted that story from the news cycle .\nWhile the president seemed to be on offense , in a larger sense he was on the defensive . He was relitigating the Charlottesville story , the fallout from which was just starting to fade . When he did denounce the KKK , neo-Nazis and white supremacists , he told the crowd , the media reaction was \u201c it should have been sooner . He 's a racist . \u201d\nBut that put him in the position of insisting he \u2019 s not a racist . And while it \u2019 s fine to punch back at the coverage , the president was wrong in insisting that he media ignored his remarks such as \u201c racism is evil. \u201d They were covered and replayed again and again .
