    "content": "A federal appeals court ruled Thursday that President Trump \u2019 s extreme vetting executive order is likely illegal , upholding a temporary restraining order that has halted most of the president \u2019 s plan and delivering the first serious legal setback of the administration .\nThe 9th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals said the administration bungled the writing of the Jan. 27 executive order by making it too broad and then botched the legal defense in court by failing to back up a number of its claims of expansive presidential powers in the area of national security .\nIn a unanimous ruling , the judges said that courts must serve as a check on the president , even when he is exercising his national security powers , and that the hassle his order would have caused to citizens , immigrants \u2014 both legal and illegal \u2014 and their relatives abroad was too much to stomach .\nOn the other hand , halting the extreme vetting policy while the courts sort out matters wouldn \u2019 t harm the government , the judges said .\n\u201c The government has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of its appeal , nor has it shown that failure to enter a stay would cause irreparable injury , and we therefore deny its emergency motion for a stay , \u201d the 9th Circuit panel wrote .\n\u201c See you in court , the security of our nation is at stake ! \u201d he wrote in all capital letters on his Twitter account within a half-hour of the court \u2019 s ruling .\nThe Justice Department wouldn \u2019 t tip its legal strategy Thursday and declined to say what Mr. Trump \u2019 s tweet meant . A spokeswoman would say only that the department \u201c is reviewing the decision and considering its options . \u201d\nThe ruling maintains a temporary restraining order imposed by a lower-court judge last week , meaning Mr. Trump can not carry out most of his policy .\nThe order halted for 90 days visitors from Iran , Iraq , Yemen , Somalia , Syria , Sudan and Libya . It also paused the U.S. refugee program for 120 days . Both delays were intended to give the government a chance to improve vetting procedures , officials said .\nSome 60,000 visas were canceled and more than 1,000 people were blocked from getting on planes to travel to the U.S. after the order went into effect .\nA number of legal challenges were filed , and the Trump administration quickly issued guidance calling for the admittance of green card holders , signifying legal permanent residence , and Iraqis traveling on visas issued in exchange for their help to the U.S. war effort .\nEven after those clarifications , the states of Washington and Minnesota filed a lawsuit in Seattle arguing that most of the policy was illegal .\nIn defending the order , the Trump administration argued that the courts shouldn \u2019 t second-guess the president \u2019 s national security decisions , particularly in the area of immigration .\nBut the 9th Circuit panel \u2014 which consisted of William Canby Jr. , an appointee of President Carter ; Richard Clifton , an appointee of President George W. Bush ; and Michelle T. Friedland , an appointee of President Obama \u2014 shot down that claim .\n\u201c There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability , which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy , \u201d the judges wrote .\nTrump attorneys also said nobody outside the U.S. has a right to a visa .\nBut Judge James L. Robart , who issued the temporary restraining order Friday , and the 9th Circuit disagreed .\nThe appeals court said illegal immigrants in the U.S. have some rights , as do relatives living inside the U.S. , to facilitate the travel of their families living outside the country . The court also declined to narrow the scope of Judge Robart \u2019 s ruling so that it would not apply to those who have never been to the U.S .\n\u201c There might be persons covered by the [ temporary restraining order ] who do not have viable due process claims , but the Government \u2019 s proposed revision leaves out at least some who do , \u201d the judges wrote .\nThe appellate judges said Mr. Trump botched the order on the whole by writing it so broadly and that it wasn \u2019 t their job to rewrite the order to make it legal .\nAn attempt by Mr. Trump \u2019 s attorneys to try to clarify his ruling by exempting green card holders was also rejected . The court said it \u201c seems unlikely \u201d that the White House counsel could legally amend or supersede an executive order signed by the president .\nThe appellate judges noted their own analysis of the case was preliminary and said they would save for later the debate over whether Mr. Trump \u2019 s policy amounts to the \u201c Muslim ban \u201d he promised during the campaign \u2014 which , if true , would be an unconstitutional infringement on religion , immigrant rights advocates said .\n\u201c In light of the sensitive interests involved , the pace of the current emergency proceedings , and our conclusion that the Government has not met its burden of showing likelihood of success on appeal on its arguments with respect to the due process claim , we reserve consideration of these claims until the merits of this appeal have been fully briefed , \u201d the judges wrote .\nThe case has already been scheduled for a fuller hearing in March . But if the Trump administration appeals this ruling in the meantime , it could seek either an en banc hearing before the full 9th Circuit or take the case to the Supreme Court .\nEven without a clear understanding of how the Trump administration would handle the case , observers were quick to react to the ruling .\nImmigrant rights advocates cheered it , saying the court stood up for refugees and immigrants .\n\u201c The government \u2019 s erratic and chaotic attempts to enforce this unconstitutional ban have taken a tremendous toll on innocent individuals , our country \u2019 s values , and our standing in the world , \u201d said Omar Jadwat , director of the American Civil Liberties Union \u2019 s Immigrants \u2019 Rights Project .\nConservatives , though , said the decision was misguided and potentially dangerous .\n\u201c No foreigner has a constitutional right to enter the United States and courts ought not second-guess sensitive national security decisions of the president , \u201d said Sen.
