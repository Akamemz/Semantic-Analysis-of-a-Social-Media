And in the past four years , the high court has dramatically expanded corporate rights .\nIt ruled that corporations have the right to spend money in candidate elections , and that some for-profit corporations may , on religious grounds , refuse to comply with a federal mandate to cover birth control in their employee health plans .\nThese are personal rights accorded to corporations . To many , the concept of corporations as people seems odd , to say the least . But it is not new .\nThe dictionary defines `` corporation '' as `` a number of persons united in one body for a purpose . '' Corporate entities date back to medieval times , observes Columbia law professor John Coffee , an authority on corporate law . `` You could think of the Catholic Church as probably the first entity that could buy and sell property in its own name , '' he says .\nIndeed , having an artificial legal persona was especially important to churches , says Elizabeth Pollman , an associate professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles .\n`` Having a corporation would allow people to put property into a collective ownership that could be held with perpetual existence , '' she says . `` So it would n't be tied to any one person 's lifespan , or subject necessarily to laws regarding inheriting property . ''\nLater on , in the United States and elsewhere , the advantages of incorporation were essential to efficient and secure economic development . Unlike partnerships , the corporation continued to exist even if a partner died ; there was no unanimity required to do something ; shareholders could not be sued individually , only the corporation as a whole , so investors only risked as much as they put into buying shares .\nBy the 1800s , the process of incorporating became relatively simple . But corporations are n't mentioned anywhere in the Constitution , leaving the courts to determine what rights corporations have \u2014 and which corporations have them . After all , Coca-Cola is a corporation , but so are the NAACP and the National Rifle Association , and so are small churches and local nonprofits .\n`` All these truly different types of organizations might come under the label 'corporation , ' `` Pollman observes . `` And so the real difficulty is figuring out how to treat these different things under the Constitution . ''\nIn the early years of the republic , the only right given to corporations was the right to have their contracts respected by the government , according to legal historian Eben Moglen .\nThe great industrialization of the United States in the 1800s , however , intensified companies ' need to raise money .\n`` With the invention of the railroad , you needed a great deal of capital to exploit its purpose , `` Columbia professor Coffee says , `` and only the corporate form offered limited liability , easy transferability of shares , and continued , perpetual existence . ''\nIn addition , the end of the Civil War and the adoption of the 14th Amendment provided an opportunity for corporations to seek further legal protection , says Moglen , also a Columbia University professor .\n`` From the moment the 14th Amendment was passed in 1868 , lawyers for corporations \u2014 particularly railroad companies \u2014 wanted to use that 14th Amendment guarantee of equal protection to make sure that the states did n't unequally treat corporations , '' Moglen says .\nNobody was talking about extending to corporations the right of free speech back then .
