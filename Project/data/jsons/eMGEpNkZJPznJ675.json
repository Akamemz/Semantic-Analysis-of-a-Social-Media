Reagan bounced back , carried 49 states in a landslide reelection , and went on to oversee an economic boom and change world history by pushing the Soviet Union into collapse . So , history tells us that presidential approval ratings at this point in time are not indicative of a president \u2019 s future success . ( Fox News )\nThe second point Gingrich brings up is that the media has failed to even compare the president \u2019 s numbers to how some of his contemporary foreign counterparts are polling .\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron is who came to Gingrich \u2019 s mind as somehow who the media and elite fawned over and was widely popular upon election but then voters changed their minds drastically .\nThe news media loved him . They lionized him because he was seen as the anti-Trump . Macron was smooth where Trump was rough . Macron was sophisticated and international where Trump was an American populist ( oh how it pains the elite media to have a crude populist as their president when they could have someone elegant who understands fine wine and cheese ) . Unfortunately for the elite media , the Macron myth has not aged well . As voters came to know him , they were put off by his icy , imperialist aloofness . As they came to understand his proposed reforms , they decided they opposed them . Macron was at 64 percent approval in June . Now , less than two months later , he has fallen to 36 percent .... BELOW TRUMP .\nInstead of reporting this , however , the media has ignored it .\nBut Macron isn \u2019 t the only world leader to poll low .\nFor example , British Prime Minister Theresa May earned a 34 percent satisfaction rate , Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had a July approval rating of 34.2 percent , and the Democratic Party in the United States received 38 percent approval in June . All of these approval ratings are lower than President Trump \u2019 s - but you don \u2019 t see the elite media fighting to break that news story .\nGingrich reminds readers to remember these two points the next time they hear pundits talk about the president \u2019 s approval numbers .\n\u201c Then relax and enjoy the nonsense knowing it is just that : nonsense , \u201d he concluded .",
