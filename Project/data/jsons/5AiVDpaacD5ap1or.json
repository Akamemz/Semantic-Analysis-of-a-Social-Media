    "content": "Bill de Blasio , like his progressive political idol Barack Obama , is finding out that you can \u2019 t do the New Politics if you don \u2019 t pay attention to the old politics .\nIn Obama \u2019 s case , it was a failure to recognize the threat posed to him by Republicans who didn \u2019 t buy into his calls for a post-partisan partnership with Congress . For New York \u2019 s ambitious liberal mayor , it was an inability to keep long-simmering tensions with the city \u2019 s traditionally powerful police department from boiling over in the past few days .\nJust over a year after sailing into office with 72 percent of the vote on a message of transformational change , de Blasio found his mayoralty subsumed by a torrent of anger , unleashed by the murder of two police officers in Brooklyn Saturday by a troubled gunman who said he was killing \u201c pigs \u201d to avenge the deaths of two men by cops in Staten Island and Ferguson , Missouri . By Monday , de Blasio was lashing out at the press corps that covers him , trying to paper over public divisions with his own police commissioner and coping with what friends described as the emotional blow of facing public rejection by many in the nation \u2019 s biggest police force . \u201c He \u2019 s pretty badly shaken \u201d by the murders , one told us .\nThat a civic tragedy would so quickly devolve into a full-blown political crisis for the new mayor was testament to the vehemence of anti-de Blasio elements in the police union \u2014 and the mayor \u2019 s mistaken belief that his 2013 victory gave him the right to shred an old Gotham political playbook that dictated a mayor show deference to the New York Police Department .\nYou can \u2019 t be big-city mayor and alienate the cops \u2014 and that \u2019 s just as true now as it was under three-term New York City Mayor Ed Koch , or even a century ago .\n\u201c Koch was loved by the cops and always told all his successors that you must have the support of the cops , that the cops can be your best friend . If Koch were alive today that \u2019 s what he would tell Bill de Blasio , \u201d said George Arzt , former press secretary to Koch , whose election in 1977 election greatly improved City Hall-police relations .\nDe Blasio \u201c needs to press reset in his relationship with the cops , \u201d Arzt said .\nGood luck with that . The bad blood between the NYPD and de Blasio is nothing new \u2014 it dates back to an election campaign centered on de Blasio \u2019 s withering criticism of the Bloomberg administration \u2019 s stop-and-frisk policy , and his close alliance with the Rev . Al Sharpton , who has organized scores of protests targeting cops over their behavior toward urban blacks .\nAccording to a former de Blasio aide , during the general election campaign in 2013 de Blasio \u2019 s team was even convinced that members of his police detail were eavesdropping on his private conversations in his city-assigned car . Things got so bad that de Blasio , according to the staffer , would step into the street to make sure he was out of earshot of plainclothes officers .\nThe low-boil contempt for de Blasio , which has been building for months , erupted publicly on Saturday when dozens of cops turned their backs on the mayor as he arrived at the Brooklyn hospital where the bodies of officers Wenjian Liu , 32 , and Rafael Ramos , 40 , had been taken .\nIn a sign of the growing strain , NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton told the \u201c Today \u201d show on Monday morning that the murder of the officers was the \u201c direct spinoff \u201d of protests against police violence \u2014 and added that police-community tensions were the highest since the 1970s . That infuriated de Blasio allies . An emotional de Blasio appeared later in the day at a Police Athletic League event , seeming jarred by the turn of events . His message , however , was now the same as Bratton \u2019 s : Protests could wait until after the funerals for the two men had passed .\nCity Hall officials seemed genuinely surprised by the ferocity of the backlash . They said de Blasio wasn \u2019 t concerned with the optics and that he \u2019 s trying to calm the waters , even if it means allowing police union leaders to lambaste him in public .\n\u201c In these situations , the loudest voices are on the most extreme ends of both sides , \u201d De Blasio senior adviser Peter Ragone said . \u201c And what we \u2019 re trying to do right now \u2026 responsible actors are trying to avoid having the loudest voices [ overtake the others ] . \u201d\nDe Blasio allies often point out that he is governing at a time of transition in the city , the first new mayor elected since the population shifted to a majority of Hispanics , blacks and Asians . The police department has seen demographic changes as well , although its top union leaders \u2014 a set of hard-edged members who have long been quote machines for the city \u2019 s voracious media \u2014 have basically remained the same . The unions , whose leaders have long criticized city mayors , are currently in a contract dispute with City Hall .\nDavid Axelrod , Obama \u2019 s longtime adviser whose former business partner , John Del Cecato , is a de Blasio adviser , said that de Blasio \u2019 s dilemma isn \u2019 t unique \u2014 it \u2019 s a burden borne by any progressive who wants to speak truth to power while wielding it . \u201c My sense is that he sincerely appreciates both the hard job the police do and the gulf that exists today , and is trying to close that breach , \u201d Axelrod said . \u201c And he has to weather the storm and speak hard truths to police and the community and , over time , the public will appreciate his role as a rational voice , trying to heal the city and move forward . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s a point of pride for the de Blasio administration that the city never erupted in violence amid protests after a Staten Island man named Eric Garner , who was black , died after an apparent chokehold from a police officer trying to arrest him on suspicion of selling loose cigarettes . The move by Staten Island officers to approach Garner was in keeping with the same controversial broken-windows anti-crime strategy that Bratton first employed as Rudy Giuliani \u2019 s police commissioner .\nPeople close to de Blasio also said he supported the Garner protesters not because he backed their position but because he wanted to avoid antagonizing them in the wake of the grand jury decision not to indict the officer who killed Garner . Above all , one source said , de Blasio wanted to avoid provoking riots akin to the unrest in Ferguson after a white cop shot an unarmed black man whom he later said had attacked him .\nBut de Blasio \u2019 s unpopularity with the historically white-dominated NYPD parallels his increasing struggles with white New Yorkers , who now disapprove of him by a nearly two-to-one margin in public polling . When confronted with similar polling numbers over the past year , de Blasio allies have repeatedly said that the mayor retains the strong backing of nonwhite New Yorkers and the Democratic base \u2014 and claimed the mayor \u2019 s private polling showed a much more modest racial disparity .\nThe blue rage isn \u2019 t rooted in any one statement de Blasio has made against cops \u2014 in fact , he has been universally supportive of the rank-and-file in his public utterances . But in his past roles as a public official , he \u2019 s often sided with the victims of police brutality , and he recently told an interviewer that he has told Dante , his teenage mixed-race son , not to reach for a cellphone around officers because it might put him in danger as a \u201c a young man of color. \u201d He took the unusual step \u2014 unimaginable under the mayoralties of Giuliani or Michael Bloomberg \u2014 of inviting Sharpton to City Hall , seating him opposite Bratton at a table where the activist proceeded to strongly denounce the police . ( \u201c If Dante wasn \u2019 t your son , he \u2019 d be a candidate for a chokehold . And we got to deal with that reality , \u201d Sharpton said to de Blasio as Bratton looked on . ) Last week , de Blasio privately met with organizers of the Garner protests , another moment that antagonized police .\nBut the action that turned off cops most of all was his defense of City Hall staffer Rachel Noerdlinger , a longtime Sharpton aide whose son and boyfriend posted anti-police messages on their Facebook accounts .
