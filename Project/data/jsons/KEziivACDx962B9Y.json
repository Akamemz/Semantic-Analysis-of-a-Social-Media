Section 212 ( f ) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 states :\nWhenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States , he may by proclamation , and for such period as he shall deem necessary , suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants , or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate .\nTherefore , if Donald Trump believes that people from Trinidad and Tobago , or Sri Lanka , or Iceland are bad news for the United States of America , regardless of the quality of his analysis in forming that belief , he is given power under federal law to ban those people from coming to the United States .\nAnd if Donald Trump should draw from a list of countries compiled by his predecessor \u2014 it was the Obama administration which made a finding that Libya , Somalia , Sudan , Iraq , Iran , Syria and Yemen can not or will not facilitate the quality of vetting of immigrants and refugees satisfactory to a proper diminution of risk of terrorism \u2014 and issue a proclamation pursuant to that 1952 law suspending entry by people from those countries , then under the law the issue is closed until such time as Trump wishes to reopen it , or Congress wishes to change the 1952 law .\nOn either a temporary or even permanent basis so long as Trump or a successor who shares his beliefs sits in the White House .\nSecond , there is no constitutional right of a foreign national to enter the United States .
