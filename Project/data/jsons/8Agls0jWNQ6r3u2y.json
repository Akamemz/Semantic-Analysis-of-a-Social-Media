Ambassador Nikki Haley eclipsed Secretary of State Rex Tillerson as America \u2019 s top diplomat .\nAs President Donald Trump heads to New York for his first United Nations General Assembly , the weeklong gathering is being viewed as the most public test yet for the shrunken diplomat at Foggy Bottom \u2014 an opportunity for Tillerson to reassert himself by the president \u2019 s side as something more than a bean-counter or risk being overshadowed by Haley on the most high-profile stage to date .\nIt would be unprecedented for a U.N. ambassador to upstage a secretary of state at the diplomatic Super Bowl .

But Pompeo , a former congressman , is not seen as eager to leave a job he loves , while Haley has been asserting herself as someone ready for something bigger since she joined the administration .\nAs grounds for accepting the U.N. post , Haley insisted that it maintain the Cabinet-level status it enjoyed under President Barack Obama \u2014 a rare elevation in a Republican administration .\nShe does not view herself as someone who reports to Tillerson , people who have worked with both principals said . She regularly video-conferences into National Security Council meetings and speaks freely with the press , often charting her own course without seeking sign-off from the White House or the State Department .\nThat course is often notably at odds with Trump \u2019 s `` America First '' vision of the world . Haley 's tough talk about human rights , Russian malfeasance and the need to oust Syrian dictator Bashar Assad is more in line with the hawkish takes of Republicans like Sens . John McCain and Lindsey Graham . She has won praise from conservative outlets , such as National Review , that have been outright hostile to Trump .\nSo far , it seems to have cost her nothing .
