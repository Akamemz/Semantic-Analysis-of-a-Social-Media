For example , deep in Justice Scalia \u2019 s lengthy opinion for a 5-to-4 majority in the landmark Second Amendment case District of Columbia v. Heller were a few sentences suggesting that the constitutional right to individual gun ownership that the court was establishing did contain some limits . \u201c Like most rights , the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited , \u201d Justice Scalia wrote , adding that \u201c nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions of the possession of firearms. \u201d He then listed several examples of \u201c longstanding \u201d prohibitions , including gun possession by people convicted of felonies and prohibitions on carrying guns \u201c in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings. \u201d ( One of those \u201c longstanding \u201d prohibitions \u2014 for schools \u2014 has proved short-lived . )\nWas this language , different in tone from the rest of the opinion and structured almost as a \u201c by the way , \u201d the price for Justice Kennedy \u2019 s vote ? I can \u2019 t prove it , but I thought so at the time , and still do . Circumstantial proof lies in the court \u2019 s failure for the past decade to take up another Second Amendment case , despite Justice Thomas \u2019 s repeated charge that the court is turning the Second Amendment into a \u201c constitutional orphan. \u201d While it takes only four votes for the court to accept a case for decision , four justices who are committed to an outcome on a hot-button topic want to be able to count to five before taking the plunge . Was the gridlock because of uncertainty about whether Justice Kennedy was all in on the Second Amendment , as Judge Kavanaugh appears to be ? A grant of a new Second Amendment appeal after the new justice takes his seat would prove my theory .\nThe court \u2019 s conservatives were not the only ones who had to modify their behavior to take account of Justice Kennedy . It often seemed to me that the court \u2019 s liberals treated him with kid gloves , signing on to opinions that they knew were weakly reasoned in order to keep him on their team , however briefly , and out of the conservatives \u2019 clutches . The most recent example was last term \u2019 s Masterpiece Cakeshop case , in which Justices Breyer and Kagan joined Justice Kennedy \u2019 s completely unpersuasive conclusion that a few nasty words about religion uttered by one or maybe two members of Colorado \u2019 s Civil Rights Commission turned the baker who wouldn \u2019 t bake a wedding cake for a same-sex couple into a victim of religious discrimination by the state .\nI guess I see the logic of Justices Breyer and Kagan bolstering Justice Kennedy and providing some insulation for him from Justices Gorsuch and Thomas , who indicated in concurring opinions that they would have ruled for the baker on more far-reaching grounds , not dependent on the supposed facts of this particular case . But did Justices Breyer and Kagan really think the multipart , multi-actor proceedings were so \u201c infected by religious hostility \u201d that the business owner who discriminated against a gay couple was actually himself the victim of discrimination ?
