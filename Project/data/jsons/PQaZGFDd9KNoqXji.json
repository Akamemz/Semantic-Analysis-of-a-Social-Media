    "content": "Despair pervaded American newsrooms following the 2016 election . It wasn \u2019 t just that most of the media had failed to foresee the outcome of the vote ; it was the realization , as one colleague put it , that \u201c nothing we do matters. \u201d Out of this despair , a new resolve and many a subscription drive were born , based on the widely shared belief that if more people consume more-accurate stories , American democracy may be saved .\nIn the popular imagination , the public is divided into two segments of roughly equal size : the \u201c liberal bubble \u201d and the \u201c right-wing bubble. \u201d In fact , there has never been much evidence that this picture was true , and two recent data points contribute to disproving it . One is a large study of the reach and impact of fake news ; the other is opinion-poll data on the tax-reform bill that Congress passed and President Trump signed into law in December . Together , they burst the two-bubble theory by showing that most Americans are better informed and less gullible than you might think . That , in turn , suggests that fighting \u201c fake news \u201d is not the solution , or perhaps even a solution , to our current political problems .\nFor the fake-news study , three political scientists from three different universities\u2014Andrew Guess , from Princeton , Brendan Nyhan , from Dartmouth , and Jason Reifler , from the University of Exeter\u2014combined data on Web traffic in the month before and one week after the election with responses to an online public-opinion survey by 2,525 Americans to determine who consumed fake news , and how much . For their definition of \u201c fake news , \u201d the authors relied on an earlier study by the economists Hunt Alcott and Matthew Gentzkow , who looked at stories that are \u201c intentionally and verifiably false and could mislead readers. \u201d The economists \u2019 study suggested that every American adult had been exposed to at least one fake news story in the leadup to the 2016 election , but relatively few people\u2014roughly eight per cent\u2014actually believed them .\nThe economists \u2019 study was based on what people recalled seeing ; the new study by the political scientists uses more and harder data . The conclusions , however , are fairly similar . First , they found that Trump supporters read fake pro-Trump stories while Clinton supporters read fake pro-Clinton stories , but the latter group consumed a lot less fake news than did the former . The study did not directly address the question of how far in advance of reading the fake stories these voting preferences had been cemented ; the authors concluded that \u201c the \u2018 echo chamber \u2019 is deep . . . but narrow. \u201d The biggest news , in other words , is that while many people were exposed to fake news stories , few were taken in by them as measured by how many similar articles they went on to read . About ten per cent of news consumers sought out more fake news , and they read an average of 33.16 fake stories , according to the political scientists .\nAn earlier study that used a different approach to data collection\u2014combining social-media sharing , hyperlinking patterns , and language use\u2014yielded similar results . In an article published in the Columbia Journalism Review last March , scholars and researchers from Harvard , Ritsumeikan , and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology argued that , in media consumption , \u201c polarization was asymmetric. \u201d In other words , rather than two bubbles , there was one , positioned far to the right of the political spectrum .
