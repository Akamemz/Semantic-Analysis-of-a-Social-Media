Romney \u2019 s foreign policy Cabinet , \u201d said one source close to the campaign . \u201c Some will probably come from his list of advisers , and some will probably come from outside . \u201d\nMr. Romney is \u201c almost certain to reach beyond his present advisory group to other conservatives who have served in past administrations , \u201d said Leslie H. Gelb , president emeritus and board senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations .\nFew expect the fall race to turn on foreign policy issues , but Mr. Romney appears to have made some progress in convincing voters of his ability to deal with global affairs , once thought a clear source of strength for the president . A Washington Post/ABC News poll in April found President Obama favored by 53 percent to 36 percent among voters on his ability to handle foreign policy issues , but a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday found the president \u2019 s advantage down to 47 percent compared with 44 percent for Mr. Romney .\nMr. Romney \u2019 s Foggy Bottom shortlist , said Mr. Gelb , probably will include recently retired World Bank President Robert B. Zoellick and Stephen J. Hadley , who served as national security adviser for four years under President George W. Bush .\nNeither man is among the 24 foreign policy analysts listed as special advisers to the campaign .\nOther potential contenders for Foggy Bottom not on the list of analysts are Deputy Secretary of State William J. Burns and former Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs R. Nicholas Burns , both of whom Mr. Gelb thinks will be in the running .\n\u201c These are people of great experience , and it \u2019 s typical once you get into the selection process to look for people with experience , \u201d Mr. Gelb said .\nBut what about John R. Bolton ? The ambassador to the United Nations under Mr. Bush is on the campaign \u2019 s advisory team and is probably its most outspoken and prolific op-ed writer .\nThe Romney-Bolton connection firmed up in 2010 when both came out against the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty ( New START ) with Russia . The treaty , which has since been passed by Congress and signed by Mr. Obama , was a divisive issue among Republicans . Retiring Sen. Jon Kyl , Arizona Republican , led an unsuccessful drive to block the accord .\n\u201c New START pitted the more neocon side of the party , the Jon Kyls and John Boltons against what I would call the more traditional internationalist wing of Henry Kissinger , James Baker , Brent Scowcroft and even Dick Lugar , \u201d said Brian Katulis , a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress . \u201c Romney basically ignored their arguments and came out pretty strongly against the treaty . \u201d\nBut the extent to which Mr. Romney aligns himself with the rest of Mr. Bolton \u2019 s bare-knuckle foreign policy positions is not clear .\n\u201c If America does not provide stability , there are only two other possibilities , \u201d Mr. Bolton wrote recently in Townhall Magazine . \u201c Either no one will provide it , and the ensuing vacuum will threaten international peace and prosperity , or others will step into the void . The United States can be certain they will not be looking out for America \u2019 s best interests , but for their own . \u201d\nThe interventionist tone of such assertions seems to make some of Mr. Romney \u2019 s foreign policy advisers uncomfortable .\nSeveral told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 in recent weeks that Mr. Romney believes the U.S. must take aggressive steps to \u201c defend \u201d its values abroad , but recoiled when asked whether Mr. Romney believes in \u201c projecting \u201d such values abroad .\nIf Mr. Romney does pick his foreign policy Cabinet from the campaign \u2019 s current pool of advisers , Mr. Bolton probably won \u2019 t make the cut , Mr. Gelb said .\n\u201c My guess is that he couldn \u2019 t get confirmed to be secretary of state or anything like that , just based on past experience , \u201d he said . \u201c Romney might take him on as some kind of special adviser in the White House , but I don \u2019 t think he \u2019 ll appoint him to anything . \u201d\nRecent weeks , meanwhile , have brought what another campaign insider described as an attempt by some advisers to jockey for position - if not to gain influence over Mr. Romney \u2019 s message , then to get their names atop the list of possible Cabinet nominees .\n\u201c Clearly there are some people politicking at the top , \u201d the insider said .\nAmong the campaign \u2019 s key advisers are former CIA Director Michael V. Hayden ; Mitchell Reiss , who once served as director of policy planning at the State Department ; and Eliot Cohen , who heads the Strategic Studies Program at Johns Hopkins University \u2019 s School of Advanced International Studies and penned the foreword to the Romney campaign \u2019 s 43-page foreign policy white paper last fall .\nAlso being mentioned is Robert Kagan , a pre-eminent conservative foreign policy theorist who - in an ironic twist - is married to Victoria Nuland , the chief spokeswoman for Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton .\nBut there are no guarantees any of them will end up in a National Security Council , U.N. ambassador or top State Department posting .\n\u201c My experience goes back to an awful lot of presidential campaigns , and generally , you just don \u2019 t know these things , \u201d said Richard Williamson , who served key positions in the George H.W .
