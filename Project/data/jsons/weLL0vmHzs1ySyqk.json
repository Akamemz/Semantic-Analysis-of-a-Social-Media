The joblessness rate , however , held at a 50-year low .\nHere were the main results from the Department of Labor \u2019 s report Friday compared to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg :\nChange in non-farm payrolls : +145,000 vs. +160,000 expected and +256,000 in November\nUnemployment rate : 3.5 % vs. 3.5 % expected and 3.5 % in November\nAverage hourly earnings , month on month : +0.1 % vs. +0.3 % expected and +0.3 % in November\nAverage hourly earnings , year on year : +2.9 % vs. +3.1 % expected and +3.1 % in November\nThe latest jobs report included downward revisions to both October and November \u2019 s payroll gains . New jobs in October totaled 152,000 , down 4,000 from the previous estimate . And payrolls in November were revised down by 10,000 to 256,000 .\nAhead of the report , most economists expected that payrolls gains would decrease in December after surging in November , when General Motors ( GM ) employees striking between September and October returned to work and pushed up results . But the end of the strike only accounted for a net revised 39,300 of November \u2019 s payroll gains in motor vehicles and parts industries \u2013 meaning underlying job growth in November was still above the one-year trend even aside from the one-time effect .\nMost of the December employment gains came from service industries , extending a trend present throughout 2019 amid broad-based softness in the manufacturing sector .\nWithin the services sector , retail trade added 41,200 jobs in December , more than reversing the decline of 14,100 from November . Education and health-services was another major job gainer , adding 36,000 positions in December . However , this was just half the additions as seen in November .\nGoods-producing industries lost a net 1,000 jobs in December , after adding 52,000 positions in November . Manufacturing lost 12,000 jobs , versus the gain of 58,000 in November boosted by the conclusion of the GM strike .\nInclusive of revisions , payrolls increased by 2.1 million overall in 2019 and averaged about 176,000 per month , representing the slowest pace of job additions since 2011 . In 2018 , job gains had averaged a227,000 per month .\nHowever , the unemployment rate also ticked lower in 2019 , with December \u2019 s 3.5 % joblessness rate matching November \u2019 s rate for the lowest level in 50 years . The lowest unemployment rate in 2018 had been 3.7 % .\nAnd in December , the closely watched U-6 underemployment rate \u2013 which also includes discouraged workers no longer seeking jobs and part-time employees seeking full-time work \u2013 fell to 6.7 % . This level was lower than any point since at least 1994 , or as far back as Bloomberg data tracks .
