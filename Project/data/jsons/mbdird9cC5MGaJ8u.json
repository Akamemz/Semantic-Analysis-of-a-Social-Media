    "content": "At 2:30 on February 14 , David Hogg was not yet a spokesperson for radicalized young America or a renowned media savant or a resistance fighter or , to some , the encapsulation of everything terrifying about where the country is going , but a high-school senior crouched in a dark classroom while a gunman with an AR-15 ranged beyond the walls of his hiding place , slaughtering 17 people in six minutes . In the quiet aftermath , when the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School had stopped but before the SWAT team had given the all clear , the 17-year-old debate geek did what first came to mind : He detached himself from the situation by turning on his phone \u2019 s video recorder and , in a perfect simulation of the news correspondents he had watched in his bedroom for years , narrated the events that had just taken place . To an imaginary audience , Hogg explained that he , like many of his classmates in Parkland , Florida , had initially thought the massacre was a drill . \u201c And then we heard more gunshots , \u201d he said somberly , still in a crouch , his face in shadow , \u201c and that was when we realized , This was not a drill . \u201d\nLike so many young men in so many foxholes before him , Hogg discovered in himself a powerful drive not to leave this Earth without making a mark . \u201c We really only remember a few hundred people , if that many , out of the billions that have ever lived , \u201d he told me at his house in a gated community in Parkland , ten days after the shooting . \u201c Is that what I was destined to become ? \u201d Hogg was home alone that day , checking his phone and keeping company with Tater , the family terrier ( allergic to grass but fond of tangerines and bananas ) , and he struck me as surprisingly composed . After the shooting , he had met up with his father but then driven himself home . That \u2019 s when he lost it , alone in the car , screaming \u201c Fuck ! \u201d again and again at the top of his lungs and hammering his fists on the dashboard . By the time he got to his house , he was calm enough to send his video to the Sun-Sentinel , the newspaper where he worked as an intern . \u201c I had the exclusive for about six hours , \u201d he told me .\nHogg understood that he was living in a historical moment . Later that evening , he shouldered past his father , who was blocking the door , and biked back to school , where he offered his eyewitness account to the first television producer he saw . The segment with Laura Ingraham aired live at 10:05 on Fox . It is remarkable to watch \u2014 Hogg with his stoic poise , his David Byrne cheekbones and wide-set stare , his grave expression and small impatient nods of understanding , narrating the day \u2019 s atrocities . But it \u2019 s most memorable for its final moments , when he refuses to allow Ingraham to offer her condolences or to get off the air . \u201c Can I say one more thing to the audience ? I don \u2019 t want this just to be another mass shooting . I don \u2019 t want this to be something that people forget . \u201d\nBy 6 a.m. , to his parents \u2019 astonishment , Hogg was in an ABC News van riding back to school , preparing to interview with George Stephanopoulos . Just past nine , on MSNBC , he was smoother now , more assertive and armed with facts . \u201c Everybody \u2019 s getting used to this , and that \u2019 s not okay , \u201d he told Stephanie Ruhle . He referenced statistics from Everytown for Gun Safety : \u201c There have been 18 more mass shootings than there need to be this year at schools . It needs to come to an end . \u201d\nInstantly he was absorbed into the crew camped out at the house of a schoolmate named Cameron Kasky , a loose association of Parkland juniors and seniors who saw the shooting with the moral clarity of revolutionaries . Soon the group was operating under a hashtag , # NeverAgain , and planning a march on Washington . Hogg was so obviously an asset , a connoisseur of news cycles and sound bites , with the ability to hoover up facts and figures like his idol John Oliver and then spew them in angry torrents before the cameras . When Anderson Cooper asked Hogg if banning bump stocks was a good idea , his answer was succinct : \u201c Absolutely , but that should have been done after 50 people were slaughtered in Las Vegas . \u201d\nHogg was good on TV \u2014 great , even \u2014 and in the marathon of coverage that followed the Parkland shooting , he honed his persona . Angry , edgy , righteous , relentless , he was the warrior who would take anyone on and refused to be knocked off message . The White House called to invite him to the president \u2019 s \u201c listening session \u201d on guns , and he hung up on them . He told this to Bill Maher on his HBO show , physically leaning across his friend Kasky and into Maher \u2019 s face to make his point . \u201c I ended on this message with them : We don \u2019 t need to listen to President Trump . President Trump needs to listen to the screams of the children and the screams of this nation . \u201d\nEmma Gonz\u00e1lez , also a senior , was friendly with Hogg from the previous year , when they collaborated on Project Aquila , an experimental weather balloon for astronomy club . ( She tracked the data ; he was the documentarian . ) After the shooting , they became figureheads of what has felt like a natural phenomenon : a groundswell , a tidal wave , perhaps something more lasting than the grief-and-outrage cycles that accompanied previous mass shootings . They were an irresistible pair . Gonz\u00e1lez spoke to the cameras and crowds with transparent emotional intensity , bringing the nation to tears with her heartbreak and fury . Hogg , also intense , was sharper , more aggressive , and spoke more strategically . His Twitter following exploded into the high six digits , hers past seven . Mostly , she drew adoration . He was easier to hate . Right-wing conspiracy theorists accused him of being a \u201c crisis actor , \u201d a pretender , a fake . Ted Nugent took a special dislike . Death threats became a regular part of his life .\nAt the March for Our Lives one month later , before a crowd of as many as 800,000 in Washington , D.C. , Hogg took a deep breath , his voice finding new bass notes when he led the crowd in chants of \u201c No more ! \u201d He afterward called for a boycott of Ingraham , forcing an apology from her on Twitter for insulting him ( she accused him of whining about not getting into UCLA ) . After that , he led a coordinated die-in at Publix supermarkets for its contributions to Florida Republican gubernatorial candidate Adam Putnam , who accepted money from the NRA . In May , Hogg and Gonz\u00e1lez led the first dance at prom , she in vamp lipstick and he in a red bow tie . In June , they announced their summer plans : Along with other kids from Stoneman Douglas , they would take a bus tour across the country to register young voters . Three legs , 75 cities , two months . The parallels to 1964 and Mississippi were unmistakable .\nThe sun was setting on Huntington Beach Pier in Orange County , California , last month , where Hogg and his classmates were visiting on week five of their tour . Several hundred people had gathered there for a vigil for the victims of gun violence : little girls wearing French braids and heart-shaped sunglasses , older lefties with weather-beaten faces wearing Obama T-shirts . Hogg was the last person to speak . Wearing a black MARCH FOR OUR LIVES hoodie , he first addressed the problem of police violence against unarmed people of color . Then , with relish , he raised the subject of Dana Rohrabacher , the local congressman in the midst of a surprisingly close race and entangled in Robert Mueller \u2019 s Russia investigation . \u201c I tweeted today that I can smell fear , and I think I can smell an indictment , too ! \u201d He concluded with the words \u201c Your hope , your vote , \u201d before turning to lead a short march to the beach .\nThe scene might be taught in future courses on political stagecraft . Hogg positioned himself at the head of the pack , instructed someone to fetch him a megaphone , and led a short chant \u2014 \u201c Tell me what democracy looks like ! \u201d \u2014 striding face-first into the lenses of the backward-scrambling photographers , the sunset reflected in his sunglasses and the wind ruffling his hair . As the procession moved down the boardwalk along Huntington Beach , where a Democrat has not won a House election in 42 years , cyclists and runners and parents pushing strollers stopped and stared at the young man who , having turned 18 , looked more than capable of achieving what he told me recently he has decided he now plans to do : run for Congress when he \u2019 s 25 .\nThe tour had begun with anti-gun activists on the South Side of Chicago and swept across America , through the cities of the industrial Midwest and Indian reservations and the open-carry state of Texas , up through red California and blue California and then back again , ending finally on the second Sunday in August , in Newtown , Connecticut , where 20 first graders had been killed one morning in 2012 by a man with an AR-15 . \u201c We were inspired by what the Freedom Riders did and what the farmers \u2019 movement out in California did , \u201d says Matthew Deitsch , a past graduate of Stoneman Douglas , whose younger siblings survived the shooting and who has taken a leave from college to work with the students . \u201c It was conscious , because these parts of our history really move the dial , really change the way we talk about certain issues. \u201d All this was paid for through the March for Our Lives Action Fund , which was established in the weeks after the shooting , quickly raised more than the roughly $ 5 million it spent on the march , and continues to support the students \u2019 activities .\nThe bus was silver and looked impermeable . It carried between 18 and 22 kids at a time , along with a handful of adults . A representative from Precision Strategies , a communications firm founded by members of the 2012 Obama campaign , frequently traveled with them , as well as Michael Skolnik , once the political director for Russell Simmons and co-founder of the Soze Agency , which is \u201c committed to amplifying the authentic narrative of a vibrant global generation. \u201d There was also a therapist on the bus , chosen by the students but insisted upon by their parents , along with a trio of hefty security guards whose job was not just to protect the kids but to constantly assess the level of threat against Hogg in particular .\nHogg , in fact , was frequently not on the bus but traveling separately in a black SUV accompanied by bodyguards . If he were a politician , one of the staffers told me , the intensity of interest in him would merit 24-hour Secret Service surveillance . \u201c We get people armed to the teeth showing up and saying , \u2018 Where \u2019 s David Hogg ? \u2019 \u201d Deitsch told me . An outfit called the Utah Gun Exchange had been following the kids on tour all summer \u2014 on what it called a pro\u2013Second Amendment \u201c freedom tour \u201d \u2014 sometimes in an armored vehicle that looks like a tank with a machine-gun turret .\nRoad to Change : How Parkland survivors and Chicago youth are uniting to end gun violence .\nThe NRA seems to take Hogg \u2019 s existence as an affront , having tweeted out his name and whereabouts and inciting its approximately 5 million members by perpetuating the falsehood that the Parkland kids want to roll back the Second Amendment . Hogg \u2019 s mother , Rebecca Boldrick , says that in June she received a letter in the mail that read , \u201c Fuck with the NRA , and you \u2019 ll be DOA . \u201d\nThe seniors at Stoneman Douglas all approached this summer differently . Some escaped Florida the minute they graduated ; others chose to avoid the celebrity-activist vortex . Mei-Ling Ho-Shing , a student who has criticized the bus tour as not being welcoming enough to the school \u2019 s students of color , spoke at the U.N. and , later , attended a spiritual retreat . \u201c I made sure nothing would mess up my week , \u201d she told me . \u201c I did not have my phone , and I did not bring my MSD shirt. \u201d Gonz\u00e1lez , both galvanized and emotionally spent , has hired a separate public-relations firm to help her manage the flood of requests for her time .\nHogg has emerged as the leader of a newly invigorated anti-gun-violence movement , the living embodiment of its message and a human front in a new culture war . The refrains he tweets \u2014 \u201c The young people will win , \u201d # USAoverNRA \u2014 have become battle cries for his young followers , and when big-ticket donors call to contribute to the Parkland fund , what they ask for is face time with Hogg himself . \u201c I think he has no fear , \u201d said Bella Robakowski , a 17-year-old who was waiting to speak with him recently at a block party in L.A. , where supporters were eating Ben & Jerry \u2019 s while a small group of NRA protesters gathered out front . Robakowski is president of NeverAgain SoCal , one of the countless organizations founded by students in the weeks after the shooting . \u201c Someone needs to get on the news and say , \u2018 We \u2019 re dying . \u2019 \u201d\nIf somebody is stupid enough to try anything on us , that will make the movement even stronger .\nA lot of what has catapulted Hogg to this elevated and precarious place is his wonkishness : his dexterity on social media and cable news , his appetite for the nitty-gritty of policy disputes . He is aware of the way his particular talents mesh with how his generation thinks . \u201c It \u2019 s like when your old-ass parent is like , \u2018 I don \u2019 t know how to send an iMessage , \u2019 and you \u2019 re just like , \u2018 Give me the fucking phone , \u2019 \u201d he told a young journalist two weeks after the shooting . At the march , he hung an orange tag stamped \u201c $ 1.05 \u201d off the microphone : It was the price the Parkland students calculated that their senator , Marco Rubio , put on each of their lives , given the donations he \u2019 d accepted from the NRA . ( At graduation , he attached it to his mortarboard like a tassel . )\nHogg \u2019 s Twitter feed is a study in narrative discipline , its relentless focus on the politicians who accept gun-lobby money twinned with exhortations to his nearly 900,000 followers to vote . \u201c People call us snowflakes , \u201d he tweeted earlier this month . \u201c What happens when all the snowflakes vote ? That \u2019 s called an avalanche . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s so funny , \u201d says Delaney Tarr , Hogg \u2019 s good friend and a founding member of the # NeverAgain crew . \u201c The way David tweets is legitimately the way he is in person . If he has an opinion , he \u2019 s not going to silence it for a moment. \u201d Unlike many of his peers , Hogg appears not to care much what people think about him . He \u2019 s been bullied before : \u201c I \u2019 m easy to pick on because I \u2019 m a string bean , \u201d he says . \u201c I \u2019 ve had this shit said about me my entire life \u201d \u2014 not death threats , but \u201c twig arms and shit like that . I don \u2019 t care. \u201d He \u2019 s discovered the power of escalation , how calamity can be turned into rage can be turned into provocation . He told one journalist , \u201c The pathetic fuckers that want to keep killing our children , they could have blood from children spattered all over their faces and they wouldn \u2019 t take action because they all still see those dollar signs. \u201d At one point , I asked him whether he worries , using that language , about riling up NRA members enough that they threaten his life and his mother \u2019 s . \u201c If somebody is stupid enough to try anything on us , that will make the movement even stronger , \u201d he said .\nAt stops throughout the tour , Hogg meditated in public on the difference between sympathy and empathy . \u201c You can \u2019 t have empathy for somebody that \u2019 s gone through something you haven \u2019 t \u2014 because definitionally you can \u2019 t , \u201d he told me in an empty seminar room at USC , between a session of a kids \u2019 summer camp and meetings with local legislators . \u201c But you can feel for them and have sympathy for them . And that \u2019 s what this country needs to practice more . It \u2019 s about realizing that you do come from a different place . I come from a privileged white community in South Florida where the median household income is over $ 128,000 a year . \u201d\nIn part , Hogg was trying to address the criticism that he and his movement are siphoning attention away from the underrepresented victims of gun violence . The students at Stoneman Douglas have learned a lot this year about problems in this country that run far deeper than individual sociopaths who can get their hands on an assault rifle . Gun deaths are an epidemiological problem in poor communities , and African-American children are ten times more likely to die from a gunshot than white ones . But he was also reflecting on himself , on his own temperamental impulse to remain disconnected , even haughty sometimes , and the way the events of this year have cracked something inside of him .\nHogg is the son of a Republican father and a Democratic mother . His sister , Lauren , just finished ninth grade ; four of her friends were killed in the shooting . Until David was in high school , the Hoggs lived in Torrance , California , where his father , Kevin , worked as an FBI agent at LAX and his mother taught at an elementary school . Kevin always kept a gun in the house \u2014 including , when he was on active duty , a rifle called an MP5 . He carried his service revolver with him even when he wasn \u2019 t working . \u201c I had it on my hip every time I went anywhere , \u201d he says . \u201c I took it to David \u2019 s Little League games. \u201d Rebecca says she always hated guns , though she once accompanied Kevin to the shooting range . ( In his retirement , Kevin maintains a Glock for personal use . )\nEven as a very young child , David was strong-willed . \u201c You could not convince him to do anything he didn \u2019 t want to do , \u201d says Rebecca . In # NeverAgain , the memoir David and Lauren recently published together , he reflects on his anti-authoritarian tendencies , recalling how he refused to learn to ride the Spider-Man bike his parents gave him in kindergarten , or to take the sailing or golf lessons they pressed on him . \u201c I would just turn everything into an us-versus-them situation , \u201d he writes .\nAlso he is dyslexic . He didn \u2019 t learn to read until the fourth grade and recalls teachers \u201c telling my parents I would amount to nothing , like I was some kind of broken toy. \u201d He found a way to process their skepticism . \u201c They taught me not to give a shit about what other people think \u2014 all that matters is what you think. \u201d Lauren attributes the way he talks today to his early dyslexia . \u201c He gets absorbed in his words because he \u2019 s been doubted so much , \u201d she says . \u201c He needs to overcompensate when he \u2019 s arguing . \u201d\nHogg frequently uses the word narcissistic in reference to himself . When Kevin was diagnosed with Parkinson \u2019 s disease and chose to retire and move the family to Florida , with its lower cost of living , David threw a massive fit , refusing at first to go at all \u2014 \u201c Screaming up the stairs , \u201d according to Lauren , \u201c \u2018 I don \u2019 t want to move to Florida ! I \u2019 m not moving ! \u2019 \u201d \u2014 and then capitulating finally but with numerous demands : a new computer , his pick of bedrooms and paint colors . He showed up at Stoneman Douglas in the middle of ninth grade , acting like he already knew everything . He rejected the girls who liked him and looked down on those who didn \u2019 t . \u201c He always was an attempter , \u201d says Deitsch , who was running the TV-production club . \u201c He would attempt to be great . He would come into TV production like he was the president , and I \u2019 d be like , \u2018 Sir , I \u2019 m in charge here . \u2019 \u201d\nBut \u201c midway through my junior year , I kind of had an existential crisis , \u201d Hogg told me . It was familiar high-school stuff having to do with unrequited love and , with college applications looming , an undistinguished academic track record . At 16 , Hogg started waking at 3 a.m. to meditate , not with a guru or through an app but following the tenets of Metta meditation . \u201c I sat there in my room very creepily in the dark , \u201d he says . \u201c I would hold on to this rock that I got in California the last time I was out there , when I was hiking with my best friend . You could tell it used to be really rough , but because it was in the ocean so much it was really smooth and soft . It fit perfectly in the palm of my hand , and then I would just hold that and try to focus . It \u2019 s really focusing on loving anyone , including those you hate . \u201d\nThe early-morning regimen of meditation and study seemed to work . He cultivated an identity as a super-dork , fanatical about journalism , always carrying a camera around and suggesting drone shots in the television production club . ( He was obsessed with the YouTube filmmaker Casey Neistat and wore sunglasses to emulate him . ) In AP Government he always sat in the front row . \u201c He constantly had questions about everything , to the point where other kids were rolling their eyes , \u201d says his teacher Jeff Foster . After class , Hogg worked in the school garden , experimenting with hydroponics in order to develop ways to grow food on Mars .\nHis grades started to rise and his confidence took on a mellower cast . He became close with Gonz\u00e1lez , who was frequently at his house , as well as Tarr and Matt Deitsch \u2019 s brother Ryan , both journalism students who are now among the more visible Stoneman Douglas activists . \u201c He was always wearing these little snap-backs , \u201d says Tarr . \u201c He was so awkward and so eager. \u201d This small clique would stake out a lunch table outside in the sun and sit there sweating rather than have to deal with the social stress of the cafeteria . \u201c We \u2019 re the misfits , \u201d Hogg told me months ago , before he became famous . \u201c We \u2019 re really nihilist . We love making jokes and being self-deprecating . It really lightens the mood . \u201d\nHogg believes this new rootedness prepared him for the events of February 14 \u2014 not just enduring the horror of the shooting itself but shouldering the responsibility of speaking for a generation . \u201c It just feels really weird because , like , months ago , nobody knew me at my school , even . I basically knew Emma , Ryan , Delaney , and a few others , but that was it . And now the world knows who we are . It feels like I \u2019 m living in a fucking terrible version of The Truman Show . \u201d\nThroughout , Gonz\u00e1lez has been his guide . \u201c She \u2019 s incredibly emotionally intelligent , \u201d he says . The kids in the movement \u201c use her as a translator , essentially , of emotion and sympathy . And she \u2019 s helped me more than I \u2019 ve ever known about what it means to listen to somebody and actually , just quite frankly , give a shit about them . Because before , even up until junior year , I didn \u2019 t really care about people . I only cared about myself. \u201d Tarr has watched the two of them grow closer as they \u2019 ve each become spectacularly famous . \u201c They are on a platform that \u2019 s leaps and bounds above any of us , \u201d she says . \u201c They know who they were before all this . They understand each other the way nobody can . \u201d\nThe bus tour was another kind of awakening . \u201c The amount of suffering I \u2019 ve seen is beyond belief , \u201d Hogg says . \u201c The amount of inequality is beyond belief. \u201d He has listened every day , multiple times , to stories of personal tragedy . Trans people told him how guns helped to stoke already high suicide rates . Native Americans , too . And parents , of course , talked about losing children for no reason at all . On Father \u2019 s Day , Hogg and the other students met Michael Brown Sr. , whose son Michael was killed by police in Ferguson , Missouri , in 2014 . \u201c He told us to close our eyes , \u201d Hogg says , \u201c and imagine the person that we love most , that we hold dearest . And then imagine them being shot and left on hot asphalt for four hours . And not knowing where they were , if that was them , and not being able to see them . I imagined my sister . I imagined Emma . I was really just thinking of , like , pretty much everybody on our team , because we \u2019 re all family now . \u201d\nHogg met a 16-year-old girl who was pregnant in a juvenile-detention center \u2014 the same jail in which her own mother , at 16 , had been pregnant with her . The situation in which that girl found herself , Hogg told me , \u201c that is not evidence of her failing in any way , shape , or form . The system perpetrates that . \u201d\nThe bus was a retreat for the kids \u2014 no reporters , no documentarians . I saw Hogg escape there one afternoon , in the middle of an outdoor event , when the gathering was packed with well-wishers elbowing each other off painted paths into cactus gardens . \u201c I don \u2019 t see myself as narcissistic as I used to be , \u201d he told me . \u201c The feeling that I get when I \u2019 m on that bus around my friends is the feeling that you get when you take your warm clothes out of the dryer and you put them on your face . \u201d\nFrom the beginning , the tour had two intersecting priorities . The first was to register young people to vote . The second , Matt Deitsch says , was \u201c to make America meet America \u201d \u2014 a national consciousness-raising effort around gun violence , introducing kids from different neighborhoods to each other and building coalitions . To put it in 21st-century terms , they were hoping to scale the movement .\nEveryone was aware that young people , historically , do not vote . Just 20 percent of people aged 18 to 29 voted in the last midterm election . The kids \u2019 basic idea was to travel to districts where youth voter turnout had been especially low , though they are so focused on Florida they decided to send a second bus to every congressional district in the swing state . They wanted Hogg and Gonz\u00e1lez on the national tour , for obvious reasons . They were the headliners , the media draw , and the ones regular people would come out to see . But also , \u201c David has so much hate targeted toward him , we really wanted people to meet him , \u201d says Deitsch . At a rally in Dallas , Hogg and Deitsch hopped a wall to speak with gun-rights protesters after a man in a red STRAIGHT OUTTA MERICA T-shirt approached them to ask if it was true what he heard , that these kids wanted to take away their guns . Hogg assured him that it was not true \u2014 his dad was FBI \u2014 and that they were for \u201c common-sense gun reform , \u201d like universal background checks . There had been multiple FBI warnings against the shooter at his school , he said . Should that kid really have been able to get a gun ? By the end , he and the protester were shaking hands . \u201c They \u2019 re not anti-gun ! They \u2019 re just common-sense whatever , \u201d the man told his friends . \u201c This is what America \u2019 s about . Come on , let me shake your hand . Someone take a picture right now . \u201d\nHogg , who had fulfilled all of his Eagle Scout requirements when the shooting occurred and then refused to participate in the initiation because of the Boy Scouts \u2019 affiliation with the NRA , is passionate and earnest about the democratic process in a way that \u2019 s far more reminiscent of the Greatest Generation than of his own . He told me , unprompted , about his fantasy of reforming high-school civics education , of making it a requirement for all four years , creating a knowledgeable citizenry that \u2019 s invested in the mechanics of government . \u201c People need to realize that people have died for your vote , \u201d Hogg says . \u201c Free college is on the ballot . The draft is on that ballot . Universal health care is on the ballot . Abortion is on the ballot . Supreme Court is on the ballot . Everything that affects your life and , more importantly , affects the people that come after you is on that ballot . Your inaction today will affect you tomorrow . \u201d\nGun violence has become a galvanizing focus for Hogg \u2019 s generation , a direct way to engage in a wide range of progressive issues \u2014 the environment , racism , inequality . It could , potentially , be the issue that actually gets people to vote , similar to how abortion drove an invigorated cohort of social conservatives to the polls in 1980 . Seventy-seven percent of voters ages 18 to 29 say gun control will be an important factor in determining their vote in the midterms , and the share of registered voters in that group is up more than 2 percent nationwide since the Parkland shooting . In certain states \u2014 Pennsylvania , New York , Indiana \u2014 it \u2019 s up much more than that . In Florida , youth voter registration is up 41 percent .\nCivic disengagement in poor communities of color is high in the post-Obama years . \u201c Going into 2016 , I heard this , and it was painful : \u2018 My vote doesn \u2019 t matter , \u2019 \u2018 We can \u2019 t change things , \u2019 \u201d says Cornell Belcher , a pollster and founder of the Brilliant Corners research firm . One of the Parkland kids \u2019 explicit goals has been to help turn this around by telling the whole story of gun violence , not just of mass shootings in schools and nightclubs .\nAt any one time , at least half the kids on the national tour were students who grew up very far from Parkland . Some had made connections with the Parkland kids way back before the march ; some were invited on the bus at the last minute . Alex King , a senior from North Lawndale College Prep in Chicago , belonged to Peace Warriors , a support group for students who \u2019 d lost a loved one to gun violence . The Parkland action fund had flown him down to meet with the students at Gonz\u00e1lez \u2019 s house in February , and he had stayed involved in the # NeverAgain activities ; at each stop on the bus tour , he told audiences what it was like , at 17 , to have attended more funerals than graduations . Bria Smith , a student activist from Milwaukee , was on a panel with them on the first week of the tour . Afterward , one of the students invited her to dinner . Then \u201c Michael Skolnik pulled me aside and asked me for my perspective on the tour . I was so shook to my core when they asked me to come. \u201d The next morning , her mother drove her to meet the kids at their hotel , and together they hit the road .\nSmith comes from a neighborhood where gun violence is so ordinary that as a child she believed it was normal . \u201c In my community , it \u2019 s easier to get a gun than it is to find a parking spot , \u201d she says . As a teenager , she joined as many activist and organizing groups as she could . The media frenzy around the Parkland shooting was difficult to watch . \u201c So many people giving media coverage to a couple students , I felt really salty , \u201d she says . \u201c We \u2019 re not given millions of dollars in donations. \u201d And when she met Hogg for the first time , \u201c I thought he was another white boy. \u201d At her school , Smith says , \u201c I hear white boys speak about politics all the time. \u201d And then he did something she thought was extraordinary . \u201c He asked me a question that no other person has asked me . He asked , \u2018 What do you need ? We can get it for you. \u2019 And I thought , Whoa . Maybe I do need to speak up about that . Maybe I do need to ask for favors . \u201d\nThe Parkland kids did their best to cede the spotlight and neutralize some of the structural inequalities they were spending their days talking about . It didn \u2019 t always work , though . When the tour came through New York , Gonz\u00e1lez and Matt Deitsch were invited on the Daily Show ; in Newtown , while the official program of speeches by Connecticut activists and Newtown students took place in a humid tent , the real action was behind the tent , where Senators Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy and three gubernatorial candidates all scrambled for face time with Gonz\u00e1lez and Hogg .\nAt a session of a Freedom Schools summer camp at USC \u2014 while younger kids sang and chanted and danced around him \u2014 Hogg receded completely , slinking down in his chair and pulling his cap over his eyes . When participants were asked to stand and fill in the sentence \u201c What sparks my interest in justice , \u201d Hogg said what was clearly on his mind : \u201c What sparks my interest in justice is how people aren \u2019 t treated equally by the press . \u201d\nJammal Lemy , a Stoneman Douglas graduate who returned to Parkland after the shooting to help with the organizing effort , wishes Hogg would relax . \u201c He overcompensates for his white guilt , \u201d Lemy says . \u201c He wants to fix everything . He needs to be more of a hand of support rather than a crutch. \u201d Hogg told me that if he \u2019 d learned anything on tour , it \u2019 s how to listen . \u201c I \u2019 m not here to speak for anyone , \u201d he told the website Complex .\nAt an event at the California African American Museum in L.A. , Hogg did not speak at all . He sat backstage with his phone beside a long table littered with half-eaten Chick-fil-A , while in the auditorium a panel of Parkland students and local activists assembled by a Black Lives Matter group discussed urban gun violence . After the panel , I watched Gonz\u00e1lez , who is tiny , get swarmed by an admiring throng and then , upon hearing that two women in wheelchairs could not approach the stage , vault over her fans to hug them . When Hogg emerged from backstage to shake hands and chat , he stood slightly apart , dutifully posing for selfies , giving each person in turn a small , mechanical smile . Later , out in the parking lot by the bus , the kids were fooling with Hula-Hoops . Ryan Deitsch demonstrated expert-level skills . Gonz\u00e1lez was pretty good . Hogg held his Hula-Hoop away from his body , game but hesitant , not quite sure he was up for the gyrating it required .\nAnd then suddenly he was on fire again . Maybe he got a good night \u2019 s sleep . Maybe it was his visit to his grandparents nearby . All the kids had accompanied him there on the Saturday after the Freedom Schools session , filming his grandparents \u2019 30-year-old pet tortoise , Toby , as he munched on a humongous leaf and then tweeting the video to his followers , comparing the wrinkly reptile to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell . When he walked into the COR AME Church in Orange County that morning , he was still laughing at the video , passing it around and counting the thousands of retweets .\nMore than a thousand people had arrived at the church to hear the panel on gun violence . It was standing room only , security everywhere , a sign-language interpreter , and giant video screens magnifying the stage : five local activists on the left and the Parkland kids on the right . Hogg was seated at the far end of the panel , his long legs sticking out from beneath the tablecloth . Every time he offered an insight or a sound bite , remarks he must have made hundreds of times by now , the audience cheered as if he were speaking truths they were desperate to hear . \u201c Honestly , Wounded Knee was the first mass shooting. \u201d \u201c In the same way we all have a right to bear arms , we all have a right to live. \u201d \u201c If you are shooting someone from 1,600 feet away , you are not defending yourself . You are hunting . \u201d\nHogg is adjusting to sudden fame in all the ways you might expect \u2014 he wears it uncomfortably sometimes , then other times it \u2019 s as if he has practiced for it his whole life . ( \u201c He \u2019 s like , \u2018 I \u2019 m not a celebrity , \u2019 \u201d his mother told me , \u201c and I \u2019 m like , \u2018 Shut up . You \u2019 re a fucking rock star. \u2019 \u201d ) After the panel , the line to see him , hug him , and take photos with him snaked almost to the back of the room , and he was clearly enjoying himself . I saw , in every place we went , teenage girls hovering just outside his circle . \u201c I think he \u2019 s really cool , obviously , \u201d a 15-year-old named Sami Shanman told me one night , as she waited to interview him for a teen-news website . \u201c For me , it \u2019 s the way he speaks . He \u2019 s the one I \u2019 ve seen the most hate on . But he \u2019 s also one of the strongest in the movement . He is so strong and not going to give up . \u201d\nAt one point this summer , I asked him if he was ever tempted by all the attention from girls his age . \u201c No , \u201d he answered . \u201c They think they know me , but they only know the me that I choose to put out there . Emma and Delaney , and the people in our group \u2014 they know me . I may be a teenage boy and a walking hormone , but I just care about everybody. \u201d Later that evening in Orange County , at a bonfire on the beach , Hogg was talking to half a dozen girls who were looking for advice on how to organize anti-gun movements at their schools . He talked about the way women get shafted at work and in culture . \u201c Promise me you won \u2019 t take anybody \u2019 s shit , \u201d he said . It was as teen-earnest as a John Hughes movie . Then he looked around at the blackness , the beach , the waves . \u201c Beaches are a place for a mass shooting , \u201d he said . \u201c I hate to bring that up . \u201d\nHogg is working on a seven-year plan . Now that the bus tour is over , he and his friends in the March for Our Lives organization plan to spend the next several months meeting more activists and canvasing in advance of the midterm elections . And if he could design his future without any obstacles , he would go to college in the fall of 2019 , \u201c read a shitload of books , \u201d then take some time off in 2020 to work on a presidential campaign .\n( Certain candidates have already approached him , he told me . ) Then , after college , he would prepare for his congressional run . \u201c I think I \u2019 ve come to that conclusion , \u201d he says . \u201c I want to be at least part of the change in Congress . \u201d\nIn the past five months , Hogg has developed political opinions on just about everything . He is against charter schools and for universal health care . He is obsessed with Mueller \u2019 s investigation and especially the indictment of Maria Butina , the alleged Russian spy who infiltrated the NRA . He believes that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is \u201c a future president of the United States. \u201d He is interested in the idea of placing age limits on politicians . \u201c The reason Republicans are successful right now is because they \u2019 re empowering young people , \u201d he told me , pointing out that Paul Ryan was 45 when he became Speaker of the House . \u201c Older Democrats just won \u2019 t move the fuck off the plate and let us take control . Nancy Pelosi is old. \u201d I am old enough to be Hogg \u2019 s mother , and pushed back on the idea that age equals ineptitude . Later , he posted a survey on Twitter . \u201c I had an interesting conversation today when the question of congressional age limits came up . Do you think there should be an age limit on congressmen , congresswomen , and congressthem ? \u201d Of more than 33,000 votes , 59 percent said yes .\nHis antenna for adult hypocrisy has made it especially difficult to find a comfortable vision of a future self \u2014 he sees so few real-life examples of the kind of politician he aspires to be . Bernie Sanders : \u201c A great guy , terrible on guns. \u201d Obama : \u201c He increased drone warfare and killed a lot of civilians. \u201d Hogg \u2019 s mother says that from birth her son has been an old soul and preternaturally mature . But sometimes he thinks and speaks exactly like a teenager . \u201c Honestly , they all kind of suck , \u201d he said .\nMore immediately , Hogg needs to figure out college . He has declined an offer of admission at UC Irvine , where he might have otherwise gone , but applying to schools again this fall isn \u2019 t very appealing \u2014 he knows he tests poorly , and he doesn \u2019 t like to write . Then there \u2019 s the problem of money . Kevin Hogg has always been famously cheap , and now that his health is deteriorating , his son is preoccupied with how he \u2019 ll pay for the stuff he needs : college , gas , food . \u201c Wherever I go , I want to go for free , because I don \u2019 t want to put that over my parents or myself. \u201d The students on the tour had received a stipend from the action fund \u2014 Hogg earned about $ 6,000 \u2014 though they received it with ambivalence , some referring to the payments as \u201c blood money . \u201d\nOf course , Hogg is now the kind of applicant many colleges would be happy to consider . Hogg \u2019 s mother told me that even Harvard is a possibility . The family was in Boston in the spring , at a gala dinner \u2014 \u201c They shut down Fenway Park , and I was like , \u2018 Oh , wow , these people know how to party \u2019 \u201d \u2014 and Harvard professors kept coming up to their table and introducing themselves . David went on a private tour , and Rebecca says that alumni told her , \u201c There is the potential that your son will be the leader of this country , and we want to make sure he goes to Harvard. \u201d Rebecca was out of her mind with pride . But \u201c we could never afford Harvard . Never . It wasn \u2019 t on our radar . I looked it up and saw how much it cost and said , \u2018 There is no way. \u2019 With any luck at all , he can get into Harvard and they can help us financially. \u201d ( Harvard declined to comment on potential candidates . )\nBackstage at the AME church , while the kids were still laughing from their visit with the tortoise , Hogg approached me . It was clear that all of the decisions he faced were piling up and making him crazy . He is being bombarded with offers and opportunities from everywhere . One of the California colleges that had rejected him just invited him to a paid speaking engagement . The tour was moving to Oakland next , where Hogg was planning to meet briefly with a Silicon Valley philanthropist who wants to pick his brain about strategies for youth engagement . \u201c I \u2019 ve been offered jobs that are six or seven figures \u201d \u2014 at media companies , at nonprofits . Recently , he met Michael Bloomberg and asked him how he schedules his life . \u201c He was like , \u2018 I have a scheduler . \u2019 \u201d\nHogg has always been earnest , Lauren says , but in recent months he has grown even more so . \u201c He \u2019 s very critical of everything and he \u2019 s super-serious , and that has become his whole life , \u201d she says . At an age when all decisions feel consequential and all outcomes dramatic , Hogg \u2019 s reality corroborates that perception . He is hyperaware of the terribleness of his circumstance , that his own future has opened up through the unimaginable murder of 17 people and is built , in some ways , on the inevitable deaths of others . On his right wrist he wears a collection of brightly colored bands stamped with the names of the Stoneman Douglas dead , and he tries to keep them constantly in mind . \u201c A kid is going to die today on the South Side of Chicago , \u201d he told me a few minutes before it was time to speak . \u201c And I hate to accept that reality . \u201d\nWe finished talking , and he left to take the stage , where I watched him heed the advice he regularly gives to teenage fans who ask what they can do if they \u2019 re not old enough to vote . \u201c The most important thing about being young is your face , \u201d he tells them . \u201c Get in people \u2019 s faces . \u201d\n* This article appears in the August 20 , 2018 , issue of \u2588\u2588\u2588 .

    "content_original": "Photo: Andres Kudacki\n\nAt 2:30 on February 14, David Hogg was not yet a spokesperson for radicalized young America or a renowned media savant or a resistance fighter or, to some, the encapsulation of everything terrifying about where the country is going, but a high-school senior crouched in a dark classroom while a gunman with an AR-15 ranged beyond the walls of his hiding place, slaughtering 17 people in six minutes. In the quiet aftermath, when the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School had stopped but before the SWAT team had given the all clear, the 17-year-old debate geek did what first came to mind: He detached himself from the situation by turning on his phone\u2019s video recorder and, in a perfect simulation of the news correspondents he had watched in his bedroom for years, narrated the events that had just taken place. To an imaginary audience, Hogg explained that he, like many of his classmates in Parkland, Florida, had initially thought the massacre was a drill. \u201cAnd then we heard more gunshots,\u201d he said somberly, still in a crouch, his face in shadow, \u201cand that was when we realized, This was not a drill.\u201d\n\nLike so many young men in so many foxholes before him, Hogg discovered in himself a powerful drive not to leave this Earth without making a mark. \u201cWe really only remember a few hundred people, if that many, out of the billions that have ever lived,\u201d he told me at his house in a gated community in Parkland, ten days after the shooting. \u201cIs that what I was destined to become?\u201d Hogg was home alone that day, checking his phone and keeping company with Tater, the family terrier (allergic to grass but fond of tangerines and bananas), and he struck me as surprisingly composed. After the shooting, he had met up with his father but then driven himself home. That\u2019s when he lost it, alone in the car, screaming \u201cFuck!\u201d again and again at the top of his lungs and hammering his fists on the dashboard. By the time he got to his house, he was calm enough to send his video to the Sun-Sentinel, the newspaper where he worked as an intern. \u201cI had the exclusive for about six hours,\u201d he told me.\n\nHogg understood that he was living in a historical moment. Later that evening, he shouldered past his father, who was blocking the door, and biked back to school, where he offered his eyewitness account to the first television producer he saw. The segment with Laura Ingraham aired live at 10:05 on Fox. It is remarkable to watch \u2014 Hogg with his stoic poise, his David Byrne cheekbones and wide-set stare, his grave expression and small impatient nods of understanding, narrating the day\u2019s atrocities. But it\u2019s most memorable for its final moments, when he refuses to allow Ingraham to offer her condolences or to get off the air. \u201cCan I say one more thing to the audience? I don\u2019t want this just to be another mass shooting. I don\u2019t want this to be something that people forget.\u201d\n\nAs One: Making the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Yearbook\n\nBy 6 a.m., to his parents\u2019 astonishment, Hogg was in an ABC News van riding back to school, preparing to interview with George Stephanopoulos. Just past nine, on MSNBC, he was smoother now, more assertive and armed with facts. \u201cEverybody\u2019s getting used to this, and that\u2019s not okay,\u201d he told Stephanie Ruhle. He referenced statistics from Everytown for Gun Safety: \u201cThere have been 18 more mass shootings than there need to be this year at schools. It needs to come to an end.\u201d\n\nInstantly he was absorbed into the crew camped out at the house of a schoolmate named Cameron Kasky, a loose association of Parkland juniors and seniors who saw the shooting with the moral clarity of revolutionaries. Soon the group was operating under a hashtag, #NeverAgain, and planning a march on Washington. Hogg was so obviously an asset, a connoisseur of news cycles and sound bites, with the ability to hoover up facts and figures like his idol John Oliver and then spew them in angry torrents before the cameras. When Anderson Cooper asked Hogg if banning bump stocks was a good idea, his answer was succinct: \u201cAbsolutely, but that should have been done after 50 people were slaughtered in Las Vegas.\u201d\n\nHogg was good on TV \u2014 great, even \u2014 and in the marathon of coverage that followed the Parkland shooting, he honed his persona. Angry, edgy, righteous, relentless, he was the warrior who would take anyone on and refused to be knocked off message. The White House called to invite him to the president\u2019s \u201clistening session\u201d on guns, and he hung up on them. He told this to Bill Maher on his HBO show, physically leaning across his friend Kasky and into Maher\u2019s face to make his point. \u201cI ended on this message with them: We don\u2019t need to listen to President Trump. President Trump needs to listen to the screams of the children and the screams of this nation.\u201d\n\nEmma Gonz\u00e1lez, also a senior, was friendly with Hogg from the previous year, when they collaborated on Project Aquila, an experimental weather balloon for astronomy club. (She tracked the data; he was the documentarian.) After the shooting, they became figureheads of what has felt like a natural phenomenon: a groundswell, a tidal wave, perhaps something more lasting than the grief-and-outrage cycles that accompanied previous mass shootings. They were an irresistible pair. Gonz\u00e1lez spoke to the cameras and crowds with transparent emotional intensity, bringing the nation to tears with her heartbreak and fury. Hogg, also intense, was sharper, more aggressive, and spoke more strategically. His Twitter following exploded into the high six digits, hers past seven. Mostly, she drew adoration. He was easier to hate. Right-wing conspiracy theorists accused him of being a \u201ccrisis actor,\u201d a pretender, a fake. Ted Nugent took a special dislike. Death threats became a regular part of his life.\n\nAt the March for Our Lives one month later, before a crowd of as many as 800,000 in Washington, D.C., Hogg took a deep breath, his voice finding new bass notes when he led the crowd in chants of \u201cNo more!\u201d He afterward called for a boycott of Ingraham, forcing an apology from her on Twitter for insulting him (she accused him of whining about not getting into UCLA). After that, he led a coordinated die-in at Publix supermarkets for its contributions to Florida Republican gubernatorial candidate Adam Putnam, who accepted money from the NRA. In May, Hogg and Gonz\u00e1lez led the first dance at prom, she in vamp lipstick and he in a red bow tie. In June, they announced their summer plans: Along with other kids from Stoneman Douglas, they would take a bus tour across the country to register young voters. Three legs, 75 cities, two months. The parallels to 1964 and Mississippi were unmistakable.\n\nThe sun was setting on Huntington Beach Pier in Orange County, California, last month, where Hogg and his classmates were visiting on week five of their tour. Several hundred people had gathered there for a vigil for the victims of gun violence: little girls wearing French braids and heart-shaped sunglasses, older lefties with weather-beaten faces wearing Obama T-shirts. Hogg was the last person to speak. Wearing a black MARCH FOR OUR LIVES hoodie, he first addressed the problem of police violence against unarmed people of color. Then, with relish, he raised the subject of Dana Rohrabacher, the local congressman in the midst of a surprisingly close race and entangled in Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. \u201cI tweeted today that I can smell fear, and I think I can smell an indictment, too!\u201d He concluded with the words \u201cYour hope, your vote,\u201d before turning to lead a short march to the beach.\n\nThe scene might be taught in future courses on political stagecraft. Hogg positioned himself at the head of the pack, instructed someone to fetch him a megaphone, and led a short chant \u2014 \u201cTell me what democracy looks like!\u201d \u2014 striding face-first into the lenses of the backward-scrambling photographers, the sunset reflected in his sunglasses and the wind ruffling his hair. As the procession moved down the boardwalk along Huntington Beach, where a Democrat has not won a House election in 42 years, cyclists and runners and parents pushing strollers stopped and stared at the young man who, having turned 18, looked more than capable of achieving what he told me recently he has decided he now plans to do: run for Congress when he\u2019s 25.\n\nHogg at a march at Huntington Beach Pier in Los Angeles. Photo: Andres Kudacki\n\nThe tour had begun with anti-gun activists on the South Side of Chicago and swept across America, through the cities of the industrial Midwest and Indian reservations and the open-carry state of Texas, up through red California and blue California and then back again, ending finally on the second Sunday in August, in Newtown, Connecticut, where 20 first graders had been killed one morning in 2012 by a man with an AR-15. \u201cWe were inspired by what the Freedom Riders did and what the farmers\u2019 movement out in California did,\u201d says Matthew Deitsch, a past graduate of Stoneman Douglas, whose younger siblings survived the shooting and who has taken a leave from college to work with the students. \u201cIt was conscious, because these parts of our history really move the dial, really change the way we talk about certain issues.\u201d All this was paid for through the March for Our Lives Action Fund, which was established in the weeks after the shooting, quickly raised more than the roughly $5 million it spent on the march, and continues to support the students\u2019 activities.\n\nThe bus was silver and looked impermeable. It carried between 18 and 22 kids at a time, along with a handful of adults. A representative from Precision Strategies, a communications firm founded by members of the 2012 Obama campaign, frequently traveled with them, as well as Michael Skolnik, once the political director for Russell Simmons and co-founder of the Soze Agency, which is \u201ccommitted to amplifying the authentic narrative of a vibrant global generation.\u201d There was also a therapist on the bus, chosen by the students but insisted upon by their parents, along with a trio of hefty security guards whose job was not just to protect the kids but to constantly assess the level of threat against Hogg in particular.\n\nHogg, in fact, was frequently not on the bus but traveling separately in a black SUV accompanied by bodyguards. If he were a politician, one of the staffers told me, the intensity of interest in him would merit 24-hour Secret Service surveillance. \u201cWe get people armed to the teeth showing up and saying, \u2018Where\u2019s David Hogg?\u2019 \u201d Deitsch told me. An outfit called the Utah Gun Exchange had been following the kids on tour all summer \u2014 on what it called a pro\u2013Second Amendment \u201cfreedom tour\u201d \u2014 sometimes in an armored vehicle that looks like a tank with a machine-gun turret.\n\nRoad to Change: How Parkland survivors and Chicago youth are uniting to end gun violence.\n\nThe NRA seems to take Hogg\u2019s existence as an affront, having tweeted out his name and whereabouts and inciting its approximately 5 million members by perpetuating the falsehood that the Parkland kids want to roll back the Second Amendment. Hogg\u2019s mother, Rebecca Boldrick, says that in June she received a letter in the mail that read, \u201cFuck with the NRA, and you\u2019ll be DOA.\u201d\n\nThe seniors at Stoneman Douglas all approached this summer differently. Some escaped Florida the minute they graduated; others chose to avoid the celebrity-activist vortex. Mei-Ling Ho-Shing, a student who has criticized the bus tour as not being welcoming enough to the school\u2019s students of color, spoke at the U.N. and, later, attended a spiritual retreat. \u201cI made sure nothing would mess up my week,\u201d she told me. \u201cI did not have my phone, and I did not bring my MSD shirt.\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez, both galvanized and emotionally spent, has hired a separate public-relations firm to help her manage the flood of requests for her time.\n\nHogg has emerged as the leader of a newly invigorated anti-gun-violence movement, the living embodiment of its message and a human front in a new culture war. The refrains he tweets \u2014 \u201cThe young people will win,\u201d #USAoverNRA \u2014 have become battle cries for his young followers, and when big-ticket donors call to contribute to the Parkland fund, what they ask for is face time with Hogg himself. \u201cI think he has no fear,\u201d said Bella Robakowski, a 17-year-old who was waiting to speak with him recently at a block party in L.A., where supporters were eating Ben & Jerry\u2019s while a small group of NRA protesters gathered out front. Robakowski is president of NeverAgain SoCal, one of the countless organizations founded by students in the weeks after the shooting. \u201cSomeone needs to get on the news and say, \u2018We\u2019re dying.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIf somebody is stupid enough to try anything on us, that will make the movement even stronger.\n\nA lot of what has catapulted Hogg to this elevated and precarious place is his wonkishness: his dexterity on social media and cable news, his appetite for the nitty-gritty of policy disputes. He is aware of the way his particular talents mesh with how his generation thinks. \u201cIt\u2019s like when your old-ass parent is like, \u2018I don\u2019t know how to send an iMessage,\u2019 and you\u2019re just like, \u2018Give me the fucking phone,\u2019 \u201d he told a young journalist two weeks after the shooting. At the march, he hung an orange tag stamped \u201c$1.05\u201d off the microphone: It was the price the Parkland students calculated that their senator, Marco Rubio, put on each of their lives, given the donations he\u2019d accepted from the NRA. (At graduation, he attached it to his mortarboard like a tassel.)\n\nHogg\u2019s Twitter feed is a study in narrative discipline, its relentless focus on the politicians who accept gun-lobby money twinned with exhortations to his nearly 900,000 followers to vote. \u201cPeople call us snowflakes,\u201d he tweeted earlier this month. \u201cWhat happens when all the snowflakes vote? That\u2019s called an avalanche.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so funny,\u201d says Delaney Tarr, Hogg\u2019s good friend and a founding member of the #NeverAgain crew. \u201cThe way David tweets is legitimately the way he is in person. If he has an opinion, he\u2019s not going to silence it for a moment.\u201d Unlike many of his peers, Hogg appears not to care much what people think about him. He\u2019s been bullied before: \u201cI\u2019m easy to pick on because I\u2019m a string bean,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve had this shit said about me my entire life\u201d \u2014 not death threats, but \u201ctwig arms and shit like that. I don\u2019t care.\u201d He\u2019s discovered the power of escalation, how calamity can be turned into rage can be turned into provocation. He told one journalist, \u201cThe pathetic fuckers that want to keep killing our children, they could have blood from children spattered all over their faces and they wouldn\u2019t take action because they all still see those dollar signs.\u201d At one point, I asked him whether he worries, using that language, about riling up NRA members enough that they threaten his life and his mother\u2019s. \u201cIf somebody is stupid enough to try anything on us, that will make the movement even stronger,\u201d he said.\n\nWith Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti. Photo: Andres Kudacki\n\nAt stops throughout the tour, Hogg meditated in public on the difference between sympathy and empathy. \u201cYou can\u2019t have empathy for somebody that\u2019s gone through something you haven\u2019t \u2014 because definitionally you can\u2019t,\u201d he told me in an empty seminar room at USC, between a session of a kids\u2019 summer camp and meetings with local legislators. \u201cBut you can feel for them and have sympathy for them. And that\u2019s what this country needs to practice more. It\u2019s about realizing that you do come from a different place. I come from a privileged white community in South Florida where the median household income is over $128,000 a year.\u201d\n\nIn part, Hogg was trying to address the criticism that he and his movement are siphoning attention away from the underrepresented victims of gun violence. The students at Stoneman Douglas have learned a lot this year about problems in this country that run far deeper than individual sociopaths who can get their hands on an assault rifle. Gun deaths are an epidemiological problem in poor communities, and African-American children are ten times more likely to die from a gunshot than white ones. But he was also reflecting on himself, on his own temperamental impulse to remain disconnected, even haughty sometimes, and the way the events of this year have cracked something inside of him.\n\nHogg is the son of a Republican father and a Democratic mother. His sister, Lauren, just finished ninth grade; four of her friends were killed in the shooting. Until David was in high school, the Hoggs lived in Torrance, California, where his father, Kevin, worked as an FBI agent at LAX and his mother taught at an elementary school. Kevin always kept a gun in the house \u2014 including, when he was on active duty, a rifle called an MP5. He carried his service revolver with him even when he wasn\u2019t working. \u201cI had it on my hip every time I went anywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cI took it to David\u2019s Little League games.\u201d Rebecca says she always hated guns, though she once accompanied Kevin to the shooting range. (In his retirement, Kevin maintains a Glock for personal use.)\n\nEven as a very young child, David was strong-willed. \u201cYou could not convince him to do anything he didn\u2019t want to do,\u201d says Rebecca. In #NeverAgain, the memoir David and Lauren recently published together, he reflects on his anti-authoritarian tendencies, recalling how he refused to learn to ride the Spider-Man bike his parents gave him in kindergarten, or to take the sailing or golf lessons they pressed on him. \u201cI would just turn everything into an us-versus-them situation,\u201d he writes.\n\nAlso he is dyslexic. He didn\u2019t learn to read until the fourth grade and recalls teachers \u201ctelling my parents I would amount to nothing, like I was some kind of broken toy.\u201d He found a way to process their skepticism. \u201cThey taught me not to give a shit about what other people think \u2014 all that matters is what you think.\u201d Lauren attributes the way he talks today to his early dyslexia. \u201cHe gets absorbed in his words because he\u2019s been doubted so much,\u201d she says. \u201cHe needs to overcompensate when he\u2019s arguing.\u201d\n\nHogg frequently uses the word narcissistic in reference to himself. When Kevin was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease and chose to retire and move the family to Florida, with its lower cost of living, David threw a massive fit, refusing at first to go at all \u2014 \u201cScreaming up the stairs,\u201d according to Lauren, \u201c \u2018I don\u2019t want to move to Florida! I\u2019m not moving!\u2019 \u201d \u2014 and then capitulating finally but with numerous demands: a new computer, his pick of bedrooms and paint colors. He showed up at Stoneman Douglas in the middle of ninth grade, acting like he already knew everything. He rejected the girls who liked him and looked down on those who didn\u2019t. \u201cHe always was an attempter,\u201d says Deitsch, who was running the TV-production club. \u201cHe would attempt to be great. He would come into TV production like he was the president, and I\u2019d be like, \u2018Sir, I\u2019m in charge here.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut \u201cmidway through my junior year, I kind of had an existential crisis,\u201d Hogg told me. It was familiar high-school stuff having to do with unrequited love and, with college applications looming, an undistinguished academic track record. At 16, Hogg started waking at 3 a.m. to meditate, not with a guru or through an app but following the tenets of Metta meditation. \u201cI sat there in my room very creepily in the dark,\u201d he says. \u201cI would hold on to this rock that I got in California the last time I was out there, when I was hiking with my best friend. You could tell it used to be really rough, but because it was in the ocean so much it was really smooth and soft. It fit perfectly in the palm of my hand, and then I would just hold that and try to focus. It\u2019s really focusing on loving anyone, including those you hate.\u201d\n\nThe early-morning regimen of meditation and study seemed to work. He cultivated an identity as a super-dork, fanatical about journalism, always carrying a camera around and suggesting drone shots in the television production club. (He was obsessed with the YouTube filmmaker Casey Neistat and wore sunglasses to emulate him.) In AP Government he always sat in the front row. \u201cHe constantly had questions about everything, to the point where other kids were rolling their eyes,\u201d says his teacher Jeff Foster. After class, Hogg worked in the school garden, experimenting with hydroponics in order to develop ways to grow food on Mars.\n\nHis grades started to rise and his confidence took on a mellower cast. He became close with Gonz\u00e1lez, who was frequently at his house, as well as Tarr and Matt Deitsch\u2019s brother Ryan, both journalism students who are now among the more visible Stoneman Douglas activists. \u201cHe was always wearing these little snap-backs,\u201d says Tarr. \u201cHe was so awkward and so eager.\u201d This small clique would stake out a lunch table outside in the sun and sit there sweating rather than have to deal with the social stress of the cafeteria. \u201cWe\u2019re the misfits,\u201d Hogg told me months ago, before he became famous. \u201cWe\u2019re really nihilist. We love making jokes and being self-deprecating. It really lightens the mood.\u201d\n\nHogg believes this new rootedness prepared him for the events of February 14 \u2014 not just enduring the horror of the shooting itself but shouldering the responsibility of speaking for a generation. \u201cIt just feels really weird because, like, months ago, nobody knew me at my school, even. I basically knew Emma, Ryan, Delaney, and a few others, but that was it. And now the world knows who we are. It feels like I\u2019m living in a fucking terrible version of The Truman Show.\u201d\n\nThroughout, Gonz\u00e1lez has been his guide. \u201cShe\u2019s incredibly emotionally intelligent,\u201d he says. The kids in the movement \u201cuse her as a translator, essentially, of emotion and sympathy. And she\u2019s helped me more than I\u2019ve ever known about what it means to listen to somebody and actually, just quite frankly, give a shit about them. Because before, even up until junior year, I didn\u2019t really care about people. I only cared about myself.\u201d Tarr has watched the two of them grow closer as they\u2019ve each become spectacularly famous. \u201cThey are on a platform that\u2019s leaps and bounds above any of us,\u201d she says. \u201cThey know who they were before all this. They understand each other the way nobody can.\u201d\n\nThe bus tour was another kind of awakening. \u201cThe amount of suffering I\u2019ve seen is beyond belief,\u201d Hogg says. \u201cThe amount of inequality is beyond belief.\u201d He has listened every day, multiple times, to stories of personal tragedy. Trans people told him how guns helped to stoke already high suicide rates. Native Americans, too. And parents, of course, talked about losing children for no reason at all. On Father\u2019s Day, Hogg and the other students met Michael Brown Sr., whose son Michael was killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. \u201cHe told us to close our eyes,\u201d Hogg says, \u201cand imagine the person that we love most, that we hold dearest. And then imagine them being shot and left on hot asphalt for four hours. And not knowing where they were, if that was them, and not being able to see them. I imagined my sister. I imagined Emma. I was really just thinking of, like, pretty much everybody on our team, because we\u2019re all family now.\u201d\n\nHogg met a 16-year-old girl who was pregnant in a juvenile-detention center \u2014 the same jail in which her own mother, at 16, had been pregnant with her. The situation in which that girl found herself, Hogg told me, \u201cthat is not evidence of her failing in any way, shape, or form. The system perpetrates that.\u201d\n\nThe bus was a retreat for the kids \u2014 no reporters, no documentarians. I saw Hogg escape there one afternoon, in the middle of an outdoor event, when the gathering was packed with well-wishers elbowing each other off painted paths into cactus gardens. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself as narcissistic as I used to be,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe feeling that I get when I\u2019m on that bus around my friends is the feeling that you get when you take your warm clothes out of the dryer and you put them on your face.\u201d\n\nA tour stop at St. Elmo Village in Los Angeles. Photo: Andres Kudacki\n\nHogg with (from left) Kelly Choi, Ariel Hobbs, and Bria Smith. Photo: Andres Kudacki\n\nFrom the beginning, the tour had two intersecting priorities. The first was to register young people to vote. The second, Matt Deitsch says, was \u201cto make America meet America\u201d \u2014 a national consciousness-raising effort around gun violence, introducing kids from different neighborhoods to each other and building coalitions. To put it in 21st-century terms, they were hoping to scale the movement.\n\nEveryone was aware that young people, historically, do not vote. Just 20 percent of people aged 18 to 29 voted in the last midterm election. The kids\u2019 basic idea was to travel to districts where youth voter turnout had been especially low, though they are so focused on Florida they decided to send a second bus to every congressional district in the swing state. They wanted Hogg and Gonz\u00e1lez on the national tour, for obvious reasons. They were the headliners, the media draw, and the ones regular people would come out to see. But also, \u201cDavid has so much hate targeted toward him, we really wanted people to meet him,\u201d says Deitsch. At a rally in Dallas, Hogg and Deitsch hopped a wall to speak with gun-rights protesters after a man in a red STRAIGHT OUTTA MERICA T-shirt approached them to ask if it was true what he heard, that these kids wanted to take away their guns. Hogg assured him that it was not true \u2014 his dad was FBI \u2014 and that they were for \u201ccommon-sense gun reform,\u201d like universal background checks. There had been multiple FBI warnings against the shooter at his school, he said. Should that kid really have been able to get a gun? By the end, he and the protester were shaking hands. \u201cThey\u2019re not anti-gun! They\u2019re just common-sense whatever,\u201d the man told his friends. \u201cThis is what America\u2019s about. Come on, let me shake your hand. Someone take a picture right now.\u201d\n\nHogg, who had fulfilled all of his Eagle Scout requirements when the shooting occurred and then refused to participate in the initiation because of the Boy Scouts\u2019 affiliation with the NRA, is passionate and earnest about the democratic process in a way that\u2019s far more reminiscent of the Greatest Generation than of his own. He told me, unprompted, about his fantasy of reforming high-school civics education, of making it a requirement for all four years, creating a knowledgeable citizenry that\u2019s invested in the mechanics of government. \u201cPeople need to realize that people have died for your vote,\u201d Hogg says. \u201cFree college is on the ballot. The draft is on that ballot. Universal health care is on the ballot. Abortion is on the ballot. Supreme Court is on the ballot. Everything that affects your life and, more importantly, affects the people that come after you is on that ballot. Your inaction today will affect you tomorrow.\u201d\n\nGun violence has become a galvanizing focus for Hogg\u2019s generation, a direct way to engage in a wide range of progressive issues \u2014 the environment, racism, inequality. It could, potentially, be the issue that actually gets people to vote, similar to how abortion drove an invigorated cohort of social conservatives to the polls in 1980. Seventy-seven percent of voters ages 18 to 29 say gun control will be an important factor in determining their vote in the midterms, and the share of registered voters in that group is up more than 2 percent nationwide since the Parkland shooting. In certain states \u2014 Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana \u2014 it\u2019s up much more than that. In Florida, youth voter registration is up 41 percent.\n\nCivic disengagement in poor communities of color is high in the post-Obama years. \u201cGoing into 2016, I heard this, and it was painful: \u2018My vote doesn\u2019t matter,\u2019 \u2018We can\u2019t change things,\u2019 \u201d says Cornell Belcher, a pollster and founder of the Brilliant Corners research firm. One of the Parkland kids\u2019 explicit goals has been to help turn this around by telling the whole story of gun violence, not just of mass shootings in schools and nightclubs.\n\nAt any one time, at least half the kids on the national tour were students who grew up very far from Parkland. Some had made connections with the Parkland kids way back before the march; some were invited on the bus at the last minute. Alex King, a senior from North Lawndale College Prep in Chicago, belonged to Peace Warriors, a support group for students who\u2019d lost a loved one to gun violence. The Parkland action fund had flown him down to meet with the students at Gonz\u00e1lez\u2019s house in February, and he had stayed involved in the #NeverAgain activities; at each stop on the bus tour, he told audiences what it was like, at 17, to have attended more funerals than graduations. Bria Smith, a student activist from Milwaukee, was on a panel with them on the first week of the tour. Afterward, one of the students invited her to dinner. Then \u201cMichael Skolnik pulled me aside and asked me for my perspective on the tour. I was so shook to my core when they asked me to come.\u201d The next morning, her mother drove her to meet the kids at their hotel, and together they hit the road.\n\nSmith comes from a neighborhood where gun violence is so ordinary that as a child she believed it was normal. \u201cIn my community, it\u2019s easier to get a gun than it is to find a parking spot,\u201d she says. As a teenager, she joined as many activist and organizing groups as she could. The media frenzy around the Parkland shooting was difficult to watch. \u201cSo many people giving media coverage to a couple students, I felt really salty,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re not given millions of dollars in donations.\u201d And when she met Hogg for the first time, \u201cI thought he was another white boy.\u201d At her school, Smith says, \u201cI hear white boys speak about politics all the time.\u201d And then he did something she thought was extraordinary. \u201cHe asked me a question that no other person has asked me. He asked, \u2018What do you need? We can get it for you.\u2019 And I thought, Whoa. Maybe I do need to speak up about that. Maybe I do need to ask for favors.\u201d\n\nThe Parkland kids did their best to cede the spotlight and neutralize some of the structural inequalities they were spending their days talking about. It didn\u2019t always work, though. When the tour came through New York, Gonz\u00e1lez and Matt Deitsch were invited on the Daily Show; in Newtown, while the official program of speeches by Connecticut activists and Newtown students took place in a humid tent, the real action was behind the tent, where Senators Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy and three gubernatorial candidates all scrambled for face time with Gonz\u00e1lez and Hogg.\n\nAt a session of a Freedom Schools summer camp at USC \u2014 while younger kids sang and chanted and danced around him \u2014 Hogg receded completely, slinking down in his chair and pulling his cap over his eyes. When participants were asked to stand and fill in the sentence \u201cWhat sparks my interest in justice,\u201d Hogg said what was clearly on his mind: \u201cWhat sparks my interest in justice is how people aren\u2019t treated equally by the press.\u201d\n\nJammal Lemy, a Stoneman Douglas graduate who returned to Parkland after the shooting to help with the organizing effort, wishes Hogg would relax. \u201cHe overcompensates for his white guilt,\u201d Lemy says. \u201cHe wants to fix everything. He needs to be more of a hand of support rather than a crutch.\u201d Hogg told me that if he\u2019d learned anything on tour, it\u2019s how to listen. \u201cI\u2019m not here to speak for anyone,\u201d he told the website Complex.\n\nAt an event at the California African American Museum in L.A., Hogg did not speak at all. He sat backstage with his phone beside a long table littered with half-eaten Chick-fil-A, while in the auditorium a panel of Parkland students and local activists assembled by a Black Lives Matter group discussed urban gun violence. After the panel, I watched Gonz\u00e1lez, who is tiny, get swarmed by an admiring throng and then, upon hearing that two women in wheelchairs could not approach the stage, vault over her fans to hug them. When Hogg emerged from backstage to shake hands and chat, he stood slightly apart, dutifully posing for selfies, giving each person in turn a small, mechanical smile. Later, out in the parking lot by the bus, the kids were fooling with Hula-Hoops. Ryan Deitsch demonstrated expert-level skills. Gonz\u00e1lez was pretty good. Hogg held his Hula-Hoop away from his body, game but hesitant, not quite sure he was up for the gyrating it required.\n\nVisiting the Robert F. Kennedy Community Schools\u2019 library in Los Angeles, at the site where Kennedy was assassinated 50 years ago. Photo: Andres Kudacki\n\nAnd then suddenly he was on fire again. Maybe he got a good night\u2019s sleep. Maybe it was his visit to his grandparents nearby. All the kids had accompanied him there on the Saturday after the Freedom Schools session, filming his grandparents\u2019 30-year-old pet tortoise, Toby, as he munched on a humongous leaf and then tweeting the video to his followers, comparing the wrinkly reptile to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. When he walked into the COR AME Church in Orange County that morning, he was still laughing at the video, passing it around and counting the thousands of retweets.\n\nMore than a thousand people had arrived at the church to hear the panel on gun violence. It was standing room only, security everywhere, a sign-language interpreter, and giant video screens magnifying the stage: five local activists on the left and the Parkland kids on the right. Hogg was seated at the far end of the panel, his long legs sticking out from beneath the tablecloth. Every time he offered an insight or a sound bite, remarks he must have made hundreds of times by now, the audience cheered as if he were speaking truths they were desperate to hear. \u201cHonestly, Wounded Knee was the first mass shooting.\u201d \u201cIn the same way we all have a right to bear arms, we all have a right to live.\u201d \u201cIf you are shooting someone from 1,600 feet away, you are not defending yourself. You are hunting.\u201d\n\nHogg is adjusting to sudden fame in all the ways you might expect \u2014 he wears it uncomfortably sometimes, then other times it\u2019s as if he has practiced for it his whole life. (\u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m not a celebrity,\u2019 \u201d his mother told me, \u201cand I\u2019m like, \u2018Shut up. You\u2019re a fucking rock star.\u2019 \u201d) After the panel, the line to see him, hug him, and take photos with him snaked almost to the back of the room, and he was clearly enjoying himself. I saw, in every place we went, teenage girls hovering just outside his circle. \u201cI think he\u2019s really cool, obviously,\u201d a 15-year-old named Sami Shanman told me one night, as she waited to interview him for a teen-news website. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s the way he speaks. He\u2019s the one I\u2019ve seen the most hate on. But he\u2019s also one of the strongest in the movement. He is so strong and not going to give up.\u201d\n\nAt one point this summer, I asked him if he was ever tempted by all the attention from girls his age. \u201cNo,\u201d he answered. \u201cThey think they know me, but they only know the me that I choose to put out there. Emma and Delaney, and the people in our group \u2014 they know me. I may be a teenage boy and a walking hormone, but I just care about everybody.\u201d Later that evening in Orange County, at a bonfire on the beach, Hogg was talking to half a dozen girls who were looking for advice on how to organize anti-gun movements at their schools. He talked about the way women get shafted at work and in culture. \u201cPromise me you won\u2019t take anybody\u2019s shit,\u201d he said. It was as teen-earnest as a John Hughes movie. Then he looked around at the blackness, the beach, the waves. \u201cBeaches are a place for a mass shooting,\u201d he said. \u201cI hate to bring that up.\u201d\n\nHogg is working on a seven-year plan. Now that the bus tour is over, he and his friends in the March for Our Lives organization plan to spend the next several months meeting more activists and canvasing in advance of the midterm elections. And if he could design his future without any obstacles, he would go to college in the fall of 2019, \u201cread a shitload of books,\u201d then take some time off in 2020 to work on a presidential campaign.\n\n(Certain candidates have already approached him, he told me.) Then, after college, he would prepare for his congressional run. \u201cI think I\u2019ve come to that conclusion,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to be at least part of the change in Congress.\u201d\n\nIn the past five months, Hogg has developed political opinions on just about everything. He is against charter schools and for universal health care. He is obsessed with Mueller\u2019s investigation and especially the indictment of Maria Butina, the alleged Russian spy who infiltrated the NRA. He believes that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is \u201ca future president of the United States.\u201d He is interested in the idea of placing age limits on politicians. \u201cThe reason Republicans are successful right now is because they\u2019re empowering young people,\u201d he told me, pointing out that Paul Ryan was 45 when he became Speaker of the House. \u201cOlder Democrats just won\u2019t move the fuck off the plate and let us take control. Nancy Pelosi is old.\u201d I am old enough to be Hogg\u2019s mother, and pushed back on the idea that age equals ineptitude. Later, he posted a survey on Twitter. \u201cI had an interesting conversation today when the question of congressional age limits came up. Do you think there should be an age limit on congressmen, congresswomen, and congressthem?\u201d Of more than 33,000 votes, 59 percent said yes.\n\nHis antenna for adult hypocrisy has made it especially difficult to find a comfortable vision of a future self \u2014 he sees so few real-life examples of the kind of politician he aspires to be. Bernie Sanders: \u201cA great guy, terrible on guns.\u201d Obama: \u201cHe increased drone warfare and killed a lot of civilians.\u201d Hogg\u2019s mother says that from birth her son has been an old soul and preternaturally mature. But sometimes he thinks and speaks exactly like a teenager. \u201cHonestly, they all kind of suck,\u201d he said.\n\nMore immediately, Hogg needs to figure out college. He has declined an offer of admission at UC Irvine, where he might have otherwise gone, but applying to schools again this fall isn\u2019t very appealing \u2014 he knows he tests poorly, and he doesn\u2019t like to write. Then there\u2019s the problem of money. Kevin Hogg has always been famously cheap, and now that his health is deteriorating, his son is preoccupied with how he\u2019ll pay for the stuff he needs: college, gas, food. \u201cWherever I go, I want to go for free, because I don\u2019t want to put that over my parents or myself.\u201d The students on the tour had received a stipend from the action fund \u2014 Hogg earned about $6,000 \u2014 though they received it with ambivalence, some referring to the payments as \u201cblood money.\u201d\n\nOf course, Hogg is now the kind of applicant many colleges would be happy to consider. Hogg\u2019s mother told me that even Harvard is a possibility. The family was in Boston in the spring, at a gala dinner \u2014 \u201cThey shut down Fenway Park, and I was like, \u2018Oh, wow, these people know how to party\u2019 \u201d \u2014 and Harvard professors kept coming up to their table and introducing themselves. David went on a private tour, and Rebecca says that alumni told her, \u201cThere is the potential that your son will be the leader of this country, and we want to make sure he goes to Harvard.\u201d Rebecca was out of her mind with pride. But \u201cwe could never afford Harvard. Never. It wasn\u2019t on our radar. I looked it up and saw how much it cost and said, \u2018There is no way.\u2019 With any luck at all, he can get into Harvard and they can help us financially.\u201d (Harvard declined to comment on potential candidates.)\n\nBackstage at the AME church, while the kids were still laughing from their visit with the tortoise, Hogg approached me. It was clear that all of the decisions he faced were piling up and making him crazy. He is being bombarded with offers and opportunities from everywhere. One of the California colleges that had rejected him just invited him to a paid speaking engagement. The tour was moving to Oakland next, where Hogg was planning to meet briefly with a Silicon Valley philanthropist who wants to pick his brain about strategies for youth engagement. \u201cI\u2019ve been offered jobs that are six or seven figures\u201d \u2014 at media companies, at nonprofits. Recently, he met Michael Bloomberg and asked him how he schedules his life. \u201cHe was like, \u2018I have a scheduler.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHogg has always been earnest, Lauren says, but in recent months he has grown even more so. \u201cHe\u2019s very critical of everything and he\u2019s super-serious, and that has become his whole life,\u201d she says. At an age when all decisions feel consequential and all outcomes dramatic, Hogg\u2019s reality corroborates that perception. He is hyperaware of the terribleness of his circumstance, that his own future has opened up through the unimaginable murder of 17 people and is built, in some ways, on the inevitable deaths of others.
