Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., will be the first amendment to the main bill, and it may end up being one of the most controversial. It proposes expanding background checks to gun shows and online sales but exempting checks in transactions between families.

The weapons ban, affecting 157 gun models, would update the 1994 law that expired in 2004. (Reid voted against the original ban.)\n\nHigh-Capacity Magazine Ban\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., plans to introduce a bill that would ban high-capacity magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. It is similar to the provision in Feinstein\u2019s bill.\n\n\u201cWe owe it to them to vote on this measure,\u201d Blumenthal said this week, referring to the Newtown families. \u201cThere is no turning back from a proposal to ban high-capacity magazines.\u201d\n\nArmed Prosecutors And Judges In Courtrooms, Federal Buildings\n\nWhile Sandy Hook was Democrats\u2019 catalyst for new gun control legislation, the shooting deaths of a Texas attorney and his wife similarly prompted Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, to introduce legislation to allow prosecutors and judges to carry weapons in courtrooms and other federal buildings for protection.\n\nCornyn told The Hill that \u201cprosecutors put their lives on the line every day, and they deserve the peace of mind to go about their work without fearing for their safety.\u201d His Line of Duty Act, S. 698, aims to do that and allows for the use of ammunition magazines \u201cof any size.\u201d\n\nImprove Mental Health Care\n\nLook for the presentation of bills or amendments that would improve mental health care in America, as well as keep guns out of the hands of those with mental health problems, something President Obama advocated for in the aftermath of Sandy Hook.

This would make it a felony for an individual to buy a gun on behalf of a felon or anyone barred from having one.
