    "content": "And even these grim numbers are assuredly low . As with most other things , when it comes to coronavirus testing , prisoners are a low priority . For example , as of this week , 29 prisoners in New Jersey are confirmed to have died from the virus . But the state has tested less than 1 percent of its incarcerated population . Despite an outbreak at a jail in Miami , Florida has only tested 615 prisoners , with 208 positive . But that \u2019 s from an incarcerated population of 95,000 . And the state \u2019 s Department of Corrections only began posting the data after several facilities were caught trying to hide virus-related deaths .\nIn the facilities that are doing more widespread testing , the figures are jaw-dropping :\n\u2014 Nearly a quarter of prisoners tested at the Bledsoe County , Tenn. , Correctional Complex have tested positive . Overall , about 20 percent of prisoners tested in Tennessee have tested positive , yet of the 16 correctional facilities surveyed by a local TV news station , 11 had tested five or fewer prisoners . Nashville journalist Steven Hale reported that , of the state \u2019 s incarcerated population of 30,000 , just under 4,000 have been tested . Two months into the outbreak , the Riverbend maximum security prison in Nashville had tested just two people .\n\u2014 At a rural prison in Arkansas , 680 of the 1,700 prisoners have tested positive .\n\u2014 Ohio is one of the few states currently mass testing prisoners . The results are astonishing . At one facility , more than 2,200 prisoners and 174 staffers tested positive . At another , nearly 1,500 prisoners and 93 staff . As of this week , 4,072 of the 6,375 inmates and staff the state has tested are positive for the coronavirus , an infection rate of over 60 percent .\n\u2014 North Carolina has tested less than 2 percent of its prisoners . But at the one facility where mass testing has been done \u2014 Nuese Correctional Institution \u2014 460 of the 770 inmates tested positive , or nearly 60 percent .\n\u2014 At Lakeland prison in Michigan , the first and so far only prison in the state to test all of its inmates , 785 of the 1,403 prisoners were positive .\n\u2014 Harris County , Tex . has tested 500 of its approximately 3,000 incarcerated people . So far , 262 have tested positive , an infected-to-tested rate of 52 percent .\n\u2014 The infection rate at the Rikers Island jail is five times that of New York City , and 30 times that of the United States . The prison \u2019 s first coronavirus death was a man who had been jailed for a technical parole violation . New York Gov . Andrew M. Cuomo ( D ) has refused to consider mass commutations to prevent further spread .\nIt isn \u2019 t much better at the federal level . In early March , after numerous warning from public health officials about the virus in jails and prisons , federal prosecutors were arguing in court filings that prisoners were more protected from covid-19 inside a prison than out . A few weeks later , the Federal Bureau of Prisons put out a statement boasting that only 10 inmates had tested positive . But that \u2019 s because the agency wasn \u2019 t testing . Five days later , the number grew to 29 prisoners and 30 staff . Then came the outbreak at the Oakdale facility in Louisiana . Prison officials there responded by simply refusing any more testing of symptomatic inmates .\nAs of the most recent BOP update , 1,692 federal prisoners have tested positive , as have 349 staff . The Associated Press reported this week that 70 percent of federal prisoners who have been tested have tested positive . At the same time , the Marshall Project recently reported that less than one half of one percent of federal prisoners have been tested .\nAt the few facilities where mass testing is taking place , infection rates are similar to those we \u2019 re seeing in state prisons . At the FCI Terminal Island in Los Angeles , for example , half the inmate population has tested positive .\nSo far , 33 federal prisoners are confirmed to have died from covid-19 . The first confirmed death was Patrick Jones , convicted of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute in a school zone . He had 21 grams of cocaine in his apartment . The \u201c school \u201d his apartment was near was a junior college . He was sentenced to 27 years in prison .\nThe most recent confirmed death was Andrea Circle Bear , a Native American woman who died after giving birth while on a ventilator . Circle Bear was serving 26 months on drug charges . A federal judge initially approved her admission into a drug-treatment program , but that decision was rescinded after federal prosecutors argued that her drug use presented a threat to her unborn child . Instead , she was sent to a prison facility in Texas , where despite her low-level crime , pregnancy and at least one preexisting condition , she was denied release , contracted the virus and died . The Rapid City Journal reports that at her sentencing , U.S. Attorney Ron Parsons told her , \u201c Don \u2019 t let yourself or your property get mixed up in the world of illegal drugs . It ends badly . ''\nIt didn \u2019 t have to be this way . Over the past two months , defense attorneys and advocates across the country have begged , pleaded , screamed and worked frantically to free as many people as possible , often putting their own health at risk .\nIn King County , Wash. , an early epicenter of the outbreak , public defenders filed motions to release low-level offenders , the sick and elderly , and those nearing the ends of their sentences . One attorney told me that while she and her colleagues attended release hearings in person , prosecutors voiced their opposition over the phone to avoid exposure . In Washington , D.C. , city officials assured the public that the jail was taking appropriate precautions , citing written policies . But they didn \u2019 t actually visit the jail in person to make sure those policies were being followed . The city \u2019 s public defenders did and found the obscene conditions later verified by an independent auditor . In Louisiana , a sitting judge dismissed covid-19 concerns by explaining to colleagues that drug users have bad hygiene and therefore are more of a threat to spread the virus outside the jail than behind bars .\nAfter pressure from some members of Congress , on April 3 , Attorney General William P. Barr issued a memo outlining terms for some federal prisoners to be released to home confinement . But as with the D.C. jail , those policies appear to only exist on paper . The aforementioned Marshall Project report found numerous examples of prisoners being told they would be released , only to find the release orders were subsequently rescinded . Politico reported that the Federal Bureau of Prisons was isolating prisoners before releasing them , sometimes in the same units where it was isolating prisoners showing symptoms of infection . It \u2019 s such a mess of mixed signals and bungled operations that one federal judge recently called it \u201c Kafkaesque . \u201d\nThis is what happens when a bureaucracy built on punishment is tasked with compassion . It \u2019 s like asking the dishwasher to make coffee . That isn \u2019 t what it \u2019 s for .\nSince the 1980s , there have been periodic waves of stories about people mysteriously found hanging in local jails \u2014 people arrested for low-level crimes such as petty theft , or drunken driving , or mundane traffic offenses . Inevitably , these flurries of stories have come with speculation that the deaths were murders . It \u2019 s hard to imagine why someone would hang himself over a reckless driving charge .\nInstead , while there have certainly been plenty of incidents of inmate deaths at the hands of jail staff , most of these deaths were suicides . These suicides themselves don \u2019 t occur in waves . They \u2019 re pretty consistent . But so often , a high-profile incident gets journalists digging , and they discover the others that have been occurring all along . Once it \u2019 s clear that the deaths were suicides after all , the outrage then dies down until the next cycle begins .\nSometimes , a few voices will make the obvious and important point : People who are arrested for low-level offenses should not be committing suicide . And that they are should tell us that there \u2019 s something wrong with our jails .\nBut that point never really seems to resonate with the public . Americans don \u2019 t want jailers actively killing people . But we don \u2019 t want our jails too cozy , either . We want them punitive . If that occasionally means conditions that might drive otherwise healthy people to suicide , or neglect that leads to preventable death from other causes , that \u2019 s tragic but not tragic enough to hold anyone accountable .\nThe covid-19 outbreaks are a symptom of the same problem , but distilled , sped up and presented in starker relief . The main difference is that unlike abuse of inmates or jailhouse suicides , this time , our neglect of the incarcerated comes with a price : As jail and prison staff get infected , they \u2019 ll bring the virus home and infect the surrounding community . But we seem to be okay with that , too .\nIn the early days of the outbreak , I spoke with a number of public defenders and criminal-justice-reform advocates who were hoping the mass emptying of the jails would help make the case for bail reform . Once thousands of low-level offenders were released to prevent virus spread and needless deaths , the thinking went , we \u2019 d see that keeping people behind bars because they can \u2019 t afford bail is purely punitive , and doing so does nothing to improve public safety .\nBut that argument rested on a faulty premise . It assumed that when confronted with the urgency of the covid-19 , that upon the realization that prisons and jails by their very nature make inmates sitting ducks for a highly communicable and potentially lethal disease , judges , governors , prosecutors and other public officials would have enough regard for the health , welfare and humanity of incarcerated people to at least get low-level offenders out of harm \u2019 s way . It assumed they would give a damn .\nIt was a good-faith assumption , grounded in the notion that even the most retributive among us would want to prevent needless mass deaths behind bars . It was wildly optimistic .",
