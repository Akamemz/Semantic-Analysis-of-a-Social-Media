That might take on more steam if , despite recent polls showing him far behind , Donald Trump is elected president .\nBut renominating Garland would mean that Clinton , who \u2019 s already running the 2016 campaign as more of an extension of Obama than she ever planned , would have to make one of her first and most significant decisions as president a direct extension of his presidency , long after he \u2019 s settled into his new home in Washington 's Kalorama neighborhood . It also could cause an instant letdown on the left , which has long been skeptical of Clinton 's liberal credentials and may want a pure progressive choice .\n\u201c Yes . I would recommend it .

Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D-Calif. ) supports renominating Garland , an aide said , as does Sen. Chris Coons ( D-Del. ) .

Garland already has two GOP senators publicly asking to bring him up for a vote and is likely to find himself increasingly popular among Republicans if Trump continues his sharp slide in the polls .\nSen. Susan Collins ( R-Maine ) told NBC \u201d s Chuck Todd that Republicans could be \u201c hoisted on their own petard \u201d by ignoring Garland because Clinton may choose someone far more liberal .\n\u201c I very much want Judge Garland to be brought up before the full Senate , \u201d Collins told Todd this week . \u201c It would be the height of irony if Hillary wins and asked President Obama to withdraw the nomination so that she can make her own choice , which almost certainly would result in a much more liberal nomination . \u201d\nSen.
