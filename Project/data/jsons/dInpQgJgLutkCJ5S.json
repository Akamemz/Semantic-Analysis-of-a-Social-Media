They are now trying to bring on reluctant Democrats from conservative states , and in some cases , members from both parties who represent a state together .\nSenator Mark Begich , Democrat of Alaska , has been cool to new gun measures , and Senator Lisa Murkowski , a Republican from the state , voted against even proceeding to debate gun measures . Supporters of the background check amendment believe the exemptions for people who live far from gun dealers might appeal to them .\nAmong the 16 Republicans who joined 50 Democrats and two independents in voting last week to proceed to consideration of gun legislation , more than a half dozen have already decided not to support the measure , and other Republicans who voted to proceed on the bill remain ambivalent . The hope is that some changes to the bill may bring others along .\n\u201c The senator is still reviewing the proposal and has not made a final decision , \u201d said Rachel Barinbaum , a spokeswoman for Mr. Begich , who last week said the measure seemed out of step with Alaska voters .\nDemocrats are also concerned about the extended absence of Senator Frank Lautenberg , a New Jersey Democrat and the oldest member of the Senate at 89 , who has been away for weeks dealing with health complications partly from cancer treatment he received several years ago .
