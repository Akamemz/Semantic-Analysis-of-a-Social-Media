But all the dire warnings give the impression the cuts are much larger than they actually are.\n\nTake today's White House example: The Department of Transportation.\n\nThe Department of Transportation's budget for 2013 is $74.2 billion. The automatic spending cuts would slice $1 billion out of its budget: that is a cut of less than 1.4 percent.\n\nAnd consider this: even if the cuts go into effect, the Department of Transportation will spend more money this year ($73.2 billion) than it spent last year ($72.6 billion).\n\nThe administration is saying that the Department of Transportation cannot squeeze 1.4 percent of its budget without sending air traffic controllers home and that they cannot find a way to operate effectively this year with a budget that is actually larger than the budget they had last year.\n\nThat may be true, but it raises larger questions about the government's ability to find relatively modest savings without cutting essential services.\n\nI asked Secretary LaHood about this at today's White House briefing:\n\nKARL: Can't you find some other way to cut without telling air traffic controllers to stay home?\n\nLAHOOD: This has to be a part of it.

There has to be some impact in order to save a billion dollars. A billion dollars is a lot of money.\n\nKARL: Let's be clear: It's less than 2 percent of your budget.\n\nLAHOOD: It's a lot of money, Jonathan.\n\nAnother fact lost amidst all the dire warnings is that although the cuts go into effect on March 1, most of the impact won't be felt until weeks or even months after that.\n\nHere's why: On March 1, the federal government will give employees 30 days notice that they may have to take unpaid leave (furlough).
