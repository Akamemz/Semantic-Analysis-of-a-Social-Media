But on the other hand , some issues are just too urgent to leave undiscussed .\nClimate change is one of those issues : While we \u2019 re stalled out in first gear fighting over whether it even exists , the forecasts of impending doom grow worse \u2014 and more urgent \u2014 every day . Which means that , as painful as it may be , talking about it with your friends and family is vital . \u201c Breaking the social silence around climate change \u2014 getting people to really begin identifying with the issue and what it means \u2014 is a crucial first step for individuals to effect change , \u201d says Adam Corner , research director for the British nonprofit Climate Outreach and co-author of the new book Talking Climate .\nAnd those conversations , he says , are far more powerful when they emphasize shared values , rather than an outsider trying to convince someone to adopt a new set of beliefs . In recent years , psychologists and social scientists have identified some tricks for communicating climate concerns in a way that doesn \u2019 t start fights or alienate people \u2014 and maybe even spurs skeptics into action .\nThe first rule of climate-change communication is : Don \u2019 t use the words \u201c climate change. \u201d That \u2019 s according to a study out of Penn State , which notes the term , along with \u201c global warming , \u201d can give the conversation a more political tone right out of the starting gate , causing people to double down on their own beliefs rather than engage with new ones .\n\u201c The very phrase \u2018 climate change \u2019 or \u2018 global warming \u2019 may serve as a trigger for people and they won \u2019 t hear anything else after that , \u201d explained Susanne Moser , a climate-change communication scholar and social-science researcher at Stanford University \u2019 s Woods Institute for the Environment . \u201c As a conversation opener , those may actually be a dead end .
