    "content": "So 2017 is probably going to be a lot like 1995 on Capitol Hill .\nRepublicans in the House and Senate are practically exuberant that they now have control of both bodies of Congress and President-elect Trump coming into the White House . They have a chance to legislate and promulgate GOP and conservative policies which registered merely as \u201c messaging bills \u201d under President Obama .\nThe election of Trump grants Republicans agency to truly legislate . Many Republicans in Congress have never served under a GOP President . Eight years of a Democratic administration wore them down . Some grew tired of always working \u201c against \u201d something rather than striving \u201c for \u201d something .\nSome Congressional Republicans grew disheartened . Uninspired . Exasperated . More years of investigations and inquiries awaited them in what many anticipated was the incoming Clinton Administration . So some Republicans turned on themselves . They went after former House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio . Chatter began that maybe House Speaker Paul Ryan , R-Wisc. , wasn \u2019 t good enough , either . Maybe Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , was the problem \u2013 so say nothing of all of those weird Senate rules .\nAnd now , Republicans hit the jackpot . Or at least think they have . They \u2019 re anxious to get started . Energized . Confident . And expectations from the public are off the chart .\nRepublicans seized control of both the House and Senate in the fabled 1994 midterm elections . Republicans lost the Senate in 1986 . So it had only been eight years in the wilderness there . But the House was another enterprise altogether . Republicans wandered aimlessly in the minority for 42 years in the House of Representatives . So entrenched were the Democrats in the House , many observers believed the party may have marshaled a \u201c permanent majority. \u201d In fact , Democrats ran the House for all but four of the previous 62 years .\nThat was until Republicans captured an astonishing 54 seats in 1994 and flipped the House to GOP control . They beat then-House Speaker Tom Foley , D-Wash. Then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich , R-Ga. , christened the incoming freshmen \u201c majority makers \u201d and was determined to show the public how the GOP could run the House better . Gingrich planned to advance his 10-point \u201c Contract with America \u201d through the House during the first hundred days . Gingrich encouraged the public to watch Congressional proceedings on C-SPAN . And in a maneuver which would appear practically archaic today , Republicans took out an ad in TV Guide which listed the ten Contract with America points . Gingrich hoped voters would follow along at home and then check off each item as they advanced through the House .\nThe parameters of the opportunity ahead for Congressional Republicans now are different compared to 1994 . But much like GOPers 22 years ago , this crowd is ready to legislate , buoyed by the opportunity to work with the Trump Administration . Their parliamentary muscles atrophied over the past few years . So Republicans are marking an ambitious agenda which features the prospective repeal and replacement of Obamacare , a new tax structure , a robust infrastructure program , a crackdown on the Obama Administration \u2019 s immigration policy and a planned rollback of various executive branch rules .\nThe House and Senate conducted a minimalist schedule over the past few years . McConnell promised full work weeks when the GOP earned control of the Senate two years ago . But the Senate rarely met for a full five days . The House adhered mostly to the classic four-day schedule . But recesses were long . Both bodies skipped town from mid-July until almost mid-September this year . Lawmakers gave back days which leaders scheduled for legislative work . The compact schedule produced harried lawmakers and aides as everyone maximized their time in Washington . GOP leaders defended the skeletal approach . They argued it was important for lawmakers to escape the Beltway and be in touch with their constituents .\nNow those sentiments are out the window . Republican lawmakers will want to be in Washington . Five-day weeks ( or more ) are expected in both chambers . Trump and Republicans have to have something to show the public\u2026and soon .
