But what else ?\nHow about being embarrassingly bad at job creation ? That 's right . From January 2011 through January 2015 , Louisiana under Jindal ranked 32nd in job creation with 5.4 percent growth over four years . Wisconsin under Walker ranked 35th , with 4.85 percent growth . New Jersey under Christie ranked 40th , with 4.15 percent growth . This compares with a national average of 8.21 percent .\nEven Ohio 's John Kasich , who 's worked more with Democrats\u2014most notably by agreeing to Medicaid expansion under Obamacare\u2014and thus tarnished his brand with conservative purists while puffing himself up with Beltway pundits -- only ranked 23rd . He 's still under the national average , with Ohio 's 6.23 percent growth . Ohio has yet to get back to 2007 employment levels , \u201c The nation and the majority of other states reached this benchmark in 2014 , \u201d said researcher Hannah Halbert , in a statement from Policy Matters Ohio .\nAnd then there 's Gov . Sam Brownback of Kansas , once a 2016 hopeful cheered on by Grover Norquist and supported by supply-side icon Arthur Laffer in his crusade to slash ( and eventually abolish ) Kansas state income tax\u2014a sure-fired job-creation move , according to the promises of all concerned . Justly dubbed a \u201c failed experiment \u201d for the massive deficits it has generated , the experiment also produced only lackluster job growth of 5.95 percent , ranking 28th in the nation\u2014better than Walker and Christie , sure , but lower than its neighbors in Nebraska ( 25th ) and Oklahoma ( 14th ) .\nAfter years on end of House Speaker John Boehner whining , \u201c Where are the jobs ? \u201d this is a singularly unimpressive lot of contenders , wannabes and dropouts . But it 's not an anomaly , as we 'll soon see . Nor is it an anomaly that the national press , so far , routinely ignores this abysmal record . But can they continue to ignore it going forward\u2014particularly in the age of social media ?\nHistorically , state governors have been the most credible candidates for president . Eight sitting governors have been elected to the White House , compared to just three sitting senators , and four vice presidents ( compared to eight who took office after a president died ) . As chief executive of a state , governors can claim an experience most similar to that of president ( though without the foreign policy part ) , and the potential diversity of that experience purportedly allows for an influx of proven practical state-level solutions to be ushered onto the national stage .\nAt least that 's how the political folklore goes . Now , however , it 's something of the opposite . With the off-year Tea Party wave of 2010 sweeping a large number of ideologically extreme politicians into office , decades of right-wing state-level institution-building reached fruition , and helped establish a high degree of uniformly mistaken economic practices\u2014cutting taxes , public investment and much-needed services , all in accordance with a playbook that 's a proven loser . While individual presidential candidates can be expected to blow their own horns , the fact that their basic playbooks are all so similar opens them up to a broader attack : the entire framework of how they think about economic policy simply does n't work .\nOf course , the GOP 's problem is much bigger than just its current crop of governors , but the pattern of their failures open it up to a new line of attack\u2014provided those failures are seen for what they are . The GOP field can be thought of in terms of three main factions : The governors , all reelected , hence \u201c proven \u201d \u2014with former governors Jeb Bush , Rick Perry and Mike Huckabee thrown in ; the first-term ( hence \u201c green \u201d and r\u00e9sum\u00e9-thin ) senators ( Ted Cruz , Rand Paul and Marco Rubio ) , and the assorted wild cards ( Ben Carson , Donald Trump , Carly Fiorina , etc . ) The senators enjoy the prominence of acting on a national stage , but doing so as part of a particularly dysfunctional Congress hardly sets them up to follow in the footsteps of Ronald Reagan , JFK or even Barack Obama . Moreover , their relentless attacks on Obama seem custom made to be turned back on them : Was he too young , in need of seasoning ? Lacking in executive experience ? A glib , superficial media star ? Really , Tea Party children of Sarah Palin ? Really ?\nEvery cheap shot the freshman GOP senators have taken , endorsed or profited from directed at Obama is now a heat-seaking missile ready to turn back on them . The wild cards are there to make the senators look ... well , senatorial , if not presidential . They are a sign of normal politics ' failure . The governors are supposed to be the remedy to all this\u2014normal politics getting back on track , recalling the promise of George W. Bush , after the GOP 's Clinton impeachment fiasco ( never mind the details of how that turned out .... ) . That 's why this crop of governors ' not-ready-for-prime-time economic records are particularly devastating : this is supposed to be their strong suit , both as governors and as Republicans . Instead , it is neither .\nIt 's not just the embarrassing job-creation numbers , though that alone should be enough to disqualify the whole lot of them . New Jersey has just experienced its ninth bond downgrade under Christie , who may end up looking for a bridge to hide under . In Wisconsin , Walker , facing a two-year deficit that could go as high as $ 2 billion , has responded with $ 300 million in cuts for higher education , on top of billions in previous education cuts . Still , job creation was supposed to be Walker 's big thing\u2014he promised to create 250,000 jobs in four years when he first ran in 2010 , but came up short by more than 100,000 jobs . Making matters worse are the neighborhood comparisons . Wisconsin ranked between 29th and 41st in job growth over the last four years , the worst in the Midwest three of those years , and second worst the other . In fact , the state performed poorly on a whole host of indicators used by Bloomberg News , and suffers markedly in contrast with neighboring Minnesota , where progressive policies have that state 's economy recovering nicely .\nPerhaps the pundits are still dazzled by these guys , but folks at home , not so much . Neither Christie nor Walker has any traction in beating Hillary Clinton in head-to-head home state matchups , probably the only kind of polls this early with any potential long-term 2016 value , since they involve figures well-known to the public being polled . Then again , Walker 's job approval fell to 41 percent in the latest Marquette Law poll ( 56 percent disapprove ) , which has plenty of other bad news for him as well .\nIn contrast , Kasich does show signs of life , but the modest dose of political pragmatism he 's shown is hardly what the GOP base is looking for , nor is he actually doing that well . Other ambitious GOP governors should really be thinking about reality TV . Bobby Jindal ? ( Budget cuts to higher education that `` would set us back generations , '' according to GOP House Speaker Chuck Kleckley ? ) Mike Pence ? Sam Brownback ?\nTo really appreciate how bad this field is , we need a bit more context . First , let 's be clear , the GOP 's perceived advantage on the economy is entirely a matter of illusion . In his book , `` They \u2019 re Not Even Close : The Democratic vs. Republican Economic Records , 1910-2010 , '' investigative historian Erik Zuesse shows that \u201c Democratic economic superiority extends not only to the performance of the stock markets , but also to employment , wages , economic equality , and all other major economic variables , \u201d as he explained in a 2012 column for Business Insider .\nThe GOP stock market record is particularly noteworthy , since it 's the epitome of what they 're supposed to do best at . However , Zuesse notes , \u201c each one of the nine separate studies ( all of the studies that have been done ) of the performance of U.S. stock markets under Republican versus under Democratic presidents and congresses , has shown consistent and overwhelming superiority of economic performance with Democrats in the White House , and also with Democrats in Congress , as compared to Republicans . \u201d\nThere 's also a considerable gap between polarized economic policy debates in Washington and a relatively cohesive consensus among most econmists , as pointed out by economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers , writing for Bloomberg in 2012 ( \u201c The U.S. Economic Policy Debate Is a Sham \u201d ) . They reference an ongoing survey of leading economists conducted by the University of Chicago \u2019 s Booth School of Business , including economists of both parties as well as independents . They note that \u201c 92 percent agreed that the stimulus succeeded in reducing the jobless rate , \u201d a point that Republican politicians routinely ridicule . ( When repeated in 2014 , 97 percent agreed . ) \u201c On the harder question of whether the benefit exceeded the cost , more than half thought it did , one in three was uncertain , and fewer than one in six disagreed , \u201d they add . ( By 2014 , just 6 percent disagreed . ) As for the \u201c Laffer Curve , \u201d and the GOP claim that tax cuts will pay for themselves by the growth they produce , Stevenson and Wolfers reported , \u201c The Booth poll couldn \u2019 t find a single economist who believed that cutting taxes today will lead to higher government revenue -- even if we lower only the top tax rate . \u201d\nTwo other more recent results are worth mentioning . Democrats have long favored infrastructure spending as a way to stimulate the economy and raise average incomes . Before Obama took office , Republicans agreed , but no longer . In May 2013 , 89 percent of economists agreed , just 5 percent disagreed . Later that same year , 91 percent agreed that a U.S. debt default would mean that \u201c U.S . families and businesses are likely to suffer severe economic harm , \u201d even as some Republicans said it would be a good thing to default . Just 3 percent disagreed .\nThe Booth expert polling results are n't monolithic , nor are they necessarily infallible\u2014orthodox economists were blindsided by the financial collapse in 2008 , after all . But the degree to which key articles of GOP economic faith clash with overwhelming expert judgment is staggering\u2014and there 's nary a hint of it in most of the media . It 's a disconnect reminiscent of global warming , but much less widely recognized .\nIndeed , pundits as a class have internalized the notion of the GOP as the \u201c daddy party , \u201d the one that does best at all manner of male-stereotyped roles : fighting wars , running the economy , understanding how things work . The Democrats are supposedly the \u201c mommy party , \u201d the one that takes care of you when you hurt .\nIt 's utter balderdash , but voters tend to buy into it . In the same column mentioned earlier , Zuesse cited a Gallup poll headline \u201c Obama Still Wins on Likability ; Romney on the Economy. \u201d The figures were telling : \u201c By 54 percent to 31 percent Obama is the more likable candidate , but by 52 percent to 43 percent Romney would 'better handle ... the economy , ' and by 54 percent to 39 percent Romney would 'better handle ... the federal budget deficit . ' \u201d\nThe majority was wrong about Romney 's economic acumen . He promised to reduce unemployment to 6 percent by the end of 2016 , a target Obama hit by October 2014 . But it was n't just about top-line economic targets\u2014it was his entire economic approach .\nAll the way back in January , 2012 , Jim Tankersley wrote a piece for the National Journal , \u201c The Romney Conundrum , \u201d taking note of the disconnect between Romney 's economic plan and the recommendations of his top advisors\u2014a disconnect paralleling the one noted by Stevenson and Wolfers : \u201c Romney issued a 59-point economic plan with fanfare last September . The platform contradicts landmark findings on monetary and housing policies published in 2011 by his top two economic advisers : Glenn Hubbard , the dean of Columbia University \u2019 s business school ; and N. Gregory Mankiw , a Harvard University professor and the author of the nation \u2019 s most widely used college economics textbook. \u201d So Romney was to be trusted because he knew so much , had such smart advisers\u2014who he completely ignored . Yet , somehow , Romney managed to muddle through the whole campaign without this glaring contradiction ever becoming a significant story in the media .\nThis is not a luxury that the current crop of GOP governors should take for granted . Sure , the press will continue to shill for them , repeating some version of \u201c daddy party \u201d nonsense , and repeating failed Clinton scandals ad nauseam , assuming Clinton wins the nomination this time . But outside groups and social media activists could mix things up a lot more this time around . And Clinton 's \u201c listening tour \u201d approach is custom-made for gaining ground-level traction , homing in on GOP failures of governance , and blowing up the prefab narratives on which the wannabes ' hopes are pinned . She 's already touched on a few highly popular proposals\u2014supporting ( however nebulously ) a livable minimum wage and free community college , for example\u2014and will obviously build on these over time . There are individual-level appeals to be made here , with significant public support .\nBut there 's also a wonk side to this unfolding story , which GOP governors are particularly vulnerable to . Not only are Democrats better for the national economy as a whole , they 're better for state-level economies , too . As far back as 2004 , it 's been noted online that red states as a whole are takers of federal tax revenues , blue states are donors . Analyzing annual data from 2008 through 2014 , red states consistently got more money than blue states , by anywhere from 36 percent to 73 percent . One result of this , naturally , is that red states can better afford to cut taxes , since they 're mooching off all the rest of us . And yet , blue states continue to do better , year after year , decade after decades .\nOne rough measure of this broad pattern was produced by David Wise , reported on the London School of Economics blog . Wise compared red , blue and purple states , based on presidential election votes since 1988 , with special weighting for the two most recent elections . This ignores statehouse and state legislative control , which sometimes diverge , so it 's not perfect , but it does reflect dominant voter values and priorities . Wise combined rankings of dozens of indicators to produce two composite measures . First , he explains , `` An Overall Economic Strength Index was based on each state \u2019 s performance for positive economic outputs in areas such as the following : per capita income , median household income , household net worth , the poverty rate , economic growth and jobs added over recent years , labor force participation , the human capital index , entrepreneurial activity , patents generated and manufacturing value-added . '' Next , `` A Social Cohesion/Dysfunction Index was designed to measure the quality of life and social cohesion in each of the states . This index included : life expectancy , infant mortality , literacy , the human development index , and the rates of drunken driving deaths , violent crime , teen pregnancy , divorce , incarceration , child abuse , domestic violence deaths and drug deaths . ''\nThe differences he found were dramatic . Comparing the average ranks in economic strength , compared to the midpoint , he found that blue states averaged 3.23 above average , purple states averaged 1.19 above average , and red states averaged 3.67 below average . Looking at the top and bottom , he wrote , `` Out of the top ten ranked states for economic strength there were four blue states , three red and three purple . Out of the bottom ten ranked states there were one blue , eight red and one purple . ''\nThe average ranks in social cohesion and dysfunction showed an even stronger difference : of blue states averaged 6.16 above the midpoint , purple states 0.52 above the midpoint , and red states averaged 5.03 below the midpoint . `` Against this index , six blue states ranked in the top ten along with two red states and two purple states . No blue state scored in the bottom 10 on this index although two purple states and eight red states did . ''\nI 've already noted one potential source of \u201c noise \u201d in this data\u2014the fact that it uses presidential elections to sort states into categories . But another source of \u201c noise \u201d is that economic policies vary over time and only represent part of what contributes to states ' economic performance\u2014as well as their social cohesion . A more focused way of examining how well certain policies work would be to look at policy rankings , and see how well they correlate with economic behavior . This wo n't eliminate the non-policy factors , but it tell us about the role of policy factors and the impact\u2014good or bad\u2014that they have .\nA November 2012 study , jointly produced by Good Jobs First and the Iowa Policy Project , \u201c Selling Snake Oil To The States , \u201d does just that . It looks at the rankings and recommendations produced by rightwing economist Arthur Laffer ( yes , that Laffer ) for ALEC ( the American Legislative Exchange Council ) a once-shadowing , but now well-known group which helps drive the conservative agenda at the state level .\nLaffer and others have created an ideologically-driven \u201c State Economic Competitiveness Index \u201d in a report titled \u201c Rich States , Poor States , \u201d starting in 2007 . \u201c Selling Snake Oil \u201d found that ALEC 's report was actually a guide to what not to do .\nAs explained in the executive summary \u201c Rich States , Poor States embodies the policy agenda that ALEC pushes to state legislators : reduction or abolition of progressive taxes , fewer investments in education and other public services , a smaller social safety net , and weaker or non-existent unions . These are the policies , ALEC claims , that promote economic growth. \u201d Although the claim that these are good policies is an ideological one , the claim that they work to promote economic growth is not\u2014it 's an empirical claim , and it can be tested , to find out if its true or false . As the report found \u201c the ALEC-Laffer recommendations not only fail to predict positive results for state economies\u2014the policies they endorse actually forecast worse state outcomes for job creation and paychecks . \u201d\nSpecifically states that ALEC ranked higher , based on a set of 15 \u201c fiscal and regulatory policy variables , \u201d actually did worse over the period of years studied , while those that ranked lower on ALEC 's scale did better . \u201c Selling Snakeoil \u201d looked at all 50 states , so there could be no concerns about \u201c cherry picking . \u201d\nFirst they examined change in state GDP , over five years , and found almost no correlation : 0.02 , which was not statistically significant . Next , they examined growth in non-farm employment , and found a somewhat stronger correlation\u2014but in the \u201c wrong \u201d direction : -0.09 , meaning that \u201c the higher a state was ranked on the A-L Index in 2007 the worse its job creation record over the next five years. \u201d Things were similar , but even worse when measuring state per capita income : The negative correlation of -.27 was statistically significant . Finally , ALEC/Laffer claimed that states following their policy prescriptions would experience more growth and higher incomes , translating into greater government revenue . But again , the correlation was negative , the opposite of what was promised : -.16 .\nThere was actually one measure which turned out as ALEC/Laffer predicted : population growth . But that 's not a measure of economic performance !\nThe study then went on to test the ALEC/Laffer ranking scale against two other obvious measures of state economic well-being : the median family income and the poverty rate . They examined the results on a year-by-year basis , median income first . \u201c The relationship is not only negative each year , it also became worse over time : the better a state did on the ALEC Outlook Ranking , the more family income declined from 2007 to 2011 . The correlation , -.30 , is statistically significant. \u201d The same pattern held , but the correlation was weaker ( .21 ) , though still \u201c marginally statistically significant . \u201d\nThere 's a lot more in the \u201c Snake Oil \u201d report . It looks at individual components of the ALEC/Laffer scale , and finds them equally unhelpful for their advertised purpose . It examines a number of key claims in greater detail , such as the arguments for lower taxes , fighting against unions and the minimum wage , and the claim that \u201c state tax rates in many instances approach 'Laffer Curve ' territory , where tax cuts would actually increase tax revenue. \u201d Of course that claim is nonsense , as already indicated above .\nThe report also spends time discussing factors that do impact state economies , which ALEC/Laffer simply ignore , despite a substantial research literature . One of the most basic things they point out is that \u201c [ I ] nstead of ALEC \u2019 s extreme policy recommendations , we find that the composition of a state \u2019 s economy\u2014whether it has large or small shares of the nation \u2019 s fastest-growing industries\u2014is a far better predictor of job and income growth. \u201d More broadly , they state :\nOverall , we find that Rich States , Poor States consistently ignores decades of published research , making broad , unsubstantiated claims and often using anecdotes or spurious two-factor correlations that fail to control for obviously relevant factors . Indeed , our analysis finds that the report repeatedly engages in methodologically primitive analysis that any college student taking Statistics 101 would be taught to avoid .\nBecause the \u201c Snake Oil \u201d report came out in late 2012 , I reached out to one of the authors , Peter Fisher , research director of the Iowa Policy Project , to find out about any more recent developments . There has been some pushback from ALEC allies , but no signs of learning . \u201c There have been two editions of RSPS since then , the latest coming out about 10 days ago , \u201d Fisher told me . \u201c They have not changed the methodology at all , so the criticisms still apply . \u201d\nIn short , ALEC is treating it as a political battle\u2014the exact sort of thing Stephenson and Wolfers were criticizing . And what about Laffer himself ? Back in 2012 , when Brownback gave Laffer a $ 75,000 contract to help sell his tax cut proposal , he was supremely confident :\nLaffer told more than 200 people at a small-business forum at Johnson County Community College that there is a war among states over tax policy and that nowhere is that revolution more powerful than in Kansas . He said Kansas \u2019 tax cuts and political shifts will produce \u201c enormous prosperity \u201d for the state . \u201c It \u2019 s not a left-wing , right-wing thing , \u201d Laffer said . \u201c It \u2019 s economics . \u201d\nHe was wrong about the \u201c enormous prosperity , \u201d of course . But his second statement was spot on . The more that reporters look past the spin , and focus on the economic records of GOP governors running for president , the more informative the coming election will be . What better time to put the information back in the information age ?",

They reference an ongoing survey of leading economists conducted by the University of Chicago\u2019s Booth School of Business, including economists of both parties as well as independents. They note that \u201c92 percent agreed that the stimulus succeeded in reducing the jobless rate,\u201d a point that Republican politicians routinely ridicule. (When repeated in 2014, 97 percent agreed.) \u201cOn the harder question of whether the benefit exceeded the cost, more than half thought it did, one in three was uncertain, and fewer than one in six disagreed,\u201d they add. (By 2014, just 6 percent disagreed.) As for the \u201cLaffer Curve,\u201d and the GOP claim that tax cuts will pay for themselves by the growth they produce, Stevenson and Wolfers reported, \u201cThe Booth poll couldn\u2019t find a single economist who believed that cutting taxes today will lead to higher government revenue -- even if we lower only the top tax rate.\u201d\n\nTwo other more recent results are worth mentioning. Democrats have long favored infrastructure spending as a way to stimulate the economy and raise average incomes. Before Obama took office, Republicans agreed, but no longer. In May 2013, 89 percent of economists agreed, just 5 percent disagreed. Later that same year, 91 percent agreed that a U.S. debt default would mean that \u201cU.S. families and businesses are likely to suffer severe economic harm,\u201d even as some Republicans said it would be a good thing to default. Just 3 percent disagreed.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe Booth expert polling results aren't monolithic, nor are they necessarily infallible\u2014orthodox economists were blindsided by the financial collapse in 2008, after all. But the degree to which key articles of GOP economic faith clash with overwhelming expert judgment is staggering\u2014and there's nary a hint of it in most of the media. It's a disconnect reminiscent of global warming, but much less widely recognized.\n\nIndeed, pundits as a class have internalized the notion of the GOP as the \u201cdaddy party,\u201d the one that does best at all manner of male-stereotyped roles: fighting wars, running the economy, understanding how things work. The Democrats are supposedly the \u201cmommy party,\u201d the one that takes care of you when you hurt.\n\nIt's utter balderdash, but voters tend to buy into it. In the same column mentioned earlier, Zuesse cited a Gallup poll headline \u201cObama Still Wins on Likability; Romney on the Economy.\u201d The figures were telling: \u201cBy 54 percent to 31 percent Obama is the more likable candidate, but by 52 percent to 43 percent Romney would 'better handle ... the economy,' and by 54 percent to 39 percent Romney would 'better handle ... the federal budget deficit.'\u201d\n\nThe majority was wrong about Romney's economic acumen. He promised to reduce unemployment to 6 percent by the end of 2016, a target Obama hit by October 2014. But it wasn't just about top-line economic targets\u2014it was his entire economic approach.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAll the way back in January, 2012, Jim Tankersley wrote a piece for the National Journal, \u201cThe Romney Conundrum,\u201d taking note of the disconnect between Romney's economic plan and the recommendations of his top advisors\u2014a disconnect paralleling the one noted by Stevenson and Wolfers: \u201cRomney issued a 59-point economic plan with fanfare last September. The platform contradicts landmark findings on monetary and housing policies published in 2011 by his top two economic advisers: Glenn Hubbard, the dean of Columbia University\u2019s business school; and N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard University professor and the author of the nation\u2019s most widely used college economics textbook.\u201d So Romney was to be trusted because he knew so much, had such smart advisers\u2014who he completely ignored. Yet, somehow, Romney managed to muddle through the whole campaign without this glaring contradiction ever becoming a significant story in the media.\n\nThis is not a luxury that the current crop of GOP governors should take for granted. Sure, the press will continue to shill for them, repeating some version of \u201cdaddy party\u201d nonsense, and repeating failed Clinton scandals ad nauseam, assuming Clinton wins the nomination this time. But outside groups and social media activists could mix things up a lot more this time around. And Clinton's \u201clistening tour\u201d approach is custom-made for gaining ground-level traction, homing in on GOP failures of governance, and blowing up the prefab narratives on which the wannabes' hopes are pinned. She's already touched on a few highly popular proposals\u2014supporting (however nebulously) a livable minimum wage and free community college, for example\u2014and will obviously build on these over time. There are individual-level appeals to be made here, with significant public support.\n\nBut there's also a wonk side to this unfolding story, which GOP governors are particularly vulnerable to. Not only are Democrats better for the national economy as a whole, they're better for state-level economies, too. As far back as 2004, it's been noted online that red states as a whole are takers of federal tax revenues, blue states are donors. Analyzing annual data from 2008 through 2014, red states consistently got more money than blue states, by anywhere from 36 percent to 73 percent. One result of this, naturally, is that red states can better afford to cut taxes, since they're mooching off all the rest of us. And yet, blue states continue to do better, year after year, decade after decades.\n\nOne rough measure of this broad pattern was produced by David Wise, reported on the London School of Economics blog. Wise compared red, blue and purple states, based on presidential election votes since 1988, with special weighting for the two most recent elections. This ignores statehouse and state legislative control, which sometimes diverge, so it's not perfect, but it does reflect dominant voter values and priorities. Wise combined rankings of dozens of indicators to produce two composite measures. First, he explains, \"An Overall Economic Strength Index was based on each state\u2019s performance for positive economic outputs in areas such as the following: per capita income, median household income, household net worth, the poverty rate, economic growth and jobs added over recent years, labor force participation, the human capital index, entrepreneurial activity, patents generated and manufacturing value-added.\" Next, \"A Social Cohesion/Dysfunction Index was designed to measure the quality of life and social cohesion in each of the states. This index included: life expectancy, infant mortality, literacy, the human development index, and the rates of drunken driving deaths, violent crime, teen pregnancy, divorce, incarceration, child abuse, domestic violence deaths and drug deaths.\"\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe differences he found were dramatic. Comparing the average ranks in economic strength, compared to the midpoint, he found that blue states averaged 3.23 above average, purple states averaged 1.19 above average, and red states averaged 3.67 below average. Looking at the top and bottom, he wrote, \"Out of the top ten ranked states for economic strength there were four blue states, three red and three purple. Out of the bottom ten ranked states there were one blue, eight red and one purple.\"\n\nThe average ranks in social cohesion and dysfunction showed an even stronger difference: of blue states averaged 6.16 above the midpoint, purple states 0.52 above the midpoint, and red states averaged 5.03 below the midpoint. \"Against this index, six blue states ranked in the top ten along with two red states and two purple states. No blue state scored in the bottom 10 on this index although two purple states and eight red states did.\"\n\nI've already noted one potential source of \u201cnoise\u201d in this data\u2014the fact that it uses presidential elections to sort states into categories. But another source of \u201cnoise\u201d is that economic policies vary over time and only represent part of what contributes to states' economic performance\u2014as well as their social cohesion. A more focused way of examining how well certain policies work would be to look at policy rankings, and see how well they correlate with economic behavior. This won't eliminate the non-policy factors, but it tell us about the role of policy factors and the impact\u2014good or bad\u2014that they have.\n\nA November 2012 study, jointly produced by Good Jobs First and the Iowa Policy Project, \u201cSelling Snake Oil To The States,\u201d does just that. It looks at the rankings and recommendations produced by rightwing economist Arthur Laffer (yes, that Laffer) for ALEC (the American Legislative Exchange Council) a once-shadowing, but now well-known group which helps drive the conservative agenda at the state level.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nLaffer and others have created an ideologically-driven \u201cState Economic Competitiveness Index\u201d in a report titled \u201cRich States, Poor States,\u201d starting in 2007. \u201cSelling Snake Oil\u201d found that ALEC's report was actually a guide to what not to do.\n\nAs explained in the executive summary \u201cRich States, Poor States embodies the policy agenda that ALEC pushes to state legislators: reduction or abolition of progressive taxes, fewer investments in education and other public services, a smaller social safety net, and weaker or non-existent unions. These are the policies, ALEC claims, that promote economic growth.\u201d Although the claim that these are good policies is an ideological one, the claim that they work to promote economic growth is not\u2014it's an empirical claim, and it can be tested, to find out if its true or false. As the report found \u201cthe ALEC-Laffer recommendations not only fail to predict positive results for state economies\u2014the policies they endorse actually forecast worse state outcomes for job creation and paychecks.\u201d\n\nSpecifically states that ALEC ranked higher, based on a set of 15 \u201cfiscal and regulatory policy variables,\u201d actually did worse over the period of years studied, while those that ranked lower on ALEC's scale did better. \u201cSelling Snakeoil\u201d looked at all 50 states, so there could be no concerns about \u201ccherry picking.\u201d\n\nFirst they examined change in state GDP, over five years, and found almost no correlation: 0.02, which was not statistically significant. Next, they examined growth in non-farm employment, and found a somewhat stronger correlation\u2014but in the \u201cwrong\u201d direction: -0.09, meaning that \u201cthe higher a state was ranked on the A-L Index in 2007 the worse its job creation record over the next five years.\u201d Things were similar, but even worse when measuring state per capita income: The negative correlation of -.27 was statistically significant. Finally, ALEC/Laffer claimed that states following their policy prescriptions would experience more growth and higher incomes, translating into greater government revenue. But again, the correlation was negative, the opposite of what was promised: -.16.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThere was actually one measure which turned out as ALEC/Laffer predicted: population growth. But that's not a measure of economic performance!\n\nThe study then went on to test the ALEC/Laffer ranking scale against two other obvious measures of state economic well-being: the median family income and the poverty rate. They examined the results on a year-by-year basis, median income first. \u201cThe relationship is not only negative each year, it also became worse over time: the better a state did on the ALEC Outlook Ranking, the more family income declined from 2007 to 2011. The correlation, -.30, is statistically significant.\u201d The same pattern held, but the correlation was weaker (.21), though still \u201cmarginally statistically significant.\u201d\n\nThere's a lot more in the \u201cSnake Oil\u201d report. It looks at individual components of the ALEC/Laffer scale, and finds them equally unhelpful for their advertised purpose. It examines a number of key claims in greater detail, such as the arguments for lower taxes, fighting against unions and the minimum wage, and the claim that \u201cstate tax rates in many instances approach 'Laffer Curve' territory, where tax cuts would actually increase tax revenue.\u201d Of course that claim is nonsense, as already indicated above.\n\nThe report also spends time discussing factors that do impact state economies, which ALEC/Laffer simply ignore, despite a substantial research literature. One of the most basic things they point out is that \u201c[I]nstead of ALEC\u2019s extreme policy recommendations, we find that the composition of a state\u2019s economy\u2014whether it has large or small shares of the nation\u2019s fastest-growing industries\u2014is a far better predictor of job and income growth.\u201d More broadly, they state:\n\nOverall, we find that Rich States, Poor States consistently ignores decades of published research, making broad, unsubstantiated claims and often using anecdotes or spurious two-factor correlations that fail to control for obviously relevant factors. Indeed, our analysis finds that the report repeatedly engages in methodologically primitive analysis that any college student taking Statistics 101 would be taught to avoid.\n\nBecause the \u201cSnake Oil\u201d report came out in late 2012, I reached out to one of the authors, Peter Fisher, research director of the Iowa Policy Project, to find out about any more recent developments. There has been some pushback from ALEC allies, but no signs of learning. \u201cThere have been two editions of RSPS since then, the latest coming out about 10 days ago,\u201d Fisher told me. \u201cThey have not changed the methodology at all, so the criticisms still apply.\u201d\n\nIn short, ALEC is treating it as a political battle\u2014the exact sort of thing Stephenson and Wolfers were criticizing. And what about Laffer himself? Back in 2012, when Brownback gave Laffer a $75,000 contract to help sell his tax cut proposal, he was supremely confident:\n\nLaffer told more than 200 people at a small-business forum at Johnson County Community College that there is a war among states over tax policy and that nowhere is that revolution more powerful than in Kansas. He said Kansas\u2019 tax cuts and political shifts will produce \u201cenormous prosperity\u201d for the state. \u201cIt\u2019s not a left-wing, right-wing thing,\u201d Laffer said. \u201cIt\u2019s economics.\u201d\n\nHe was wrong about the \u201cenormous prosperity,\u201d of course. But his second statement was spot on. The more that reporters look past the spin, and focus on the economic records of GOP governors running for president, the more informative the coming election will be. What better time to put the information back in the information age?",
