After all , principles are merely shorthand for the best practices of a just society . When some alleged principle helps leftists enserf-ify you , then it \u2019 s a pretty Schiffy principle , isn \u2019 t it ?\nWeaponizing principles is one of the left \u2019 s favorite tactics , and it \u2019 s right out of Alinsky 101 . Rule for Radical No . 4 is `` Make the enemy live up to its own book of rules . '' And it works really well , right up until the moment that you stop playing by the rules that the left is trying to jam down your throat .\nNow , the objection to my view \u2013 offered in good faith by good faith conservatives ( you old softies ) and in bad faith by the cruise-shilling Fredocon hacks who make common cause with our enemies \u2013 is that this kind of wokeness makes one unprincipled . It doesn \u2019 t . Those of us who see what \u2019 s happening and refuse to go full lemming \u2013 never go full lemming \u2013 are not abandoning conservative principles . We \u2019 re just not trying to hold onto the alleged principles that have abandoned us .\nThis comes up a lot recently as the left has redoubled its efforts to weaponize our principles to create a monopoly on power . We \u2019 ve seen Big Tech do it for a while now , but today it \u2019 s happening even more . The idea is to leverage our purported beliefs so that we are diverted from protecting and asserting our own interests by blind adherence to a version of conservative dogma that our opponents force-feed us and that we , for some reason , all too often fail to puke back up all over them like a supermodel exiting a Golden Corral .\nTime to get woke to the scam and stop playing their no-win game .\nOne of the best examples of this is the argument that we conservatives can not make a moral argument against , or use their political power to provide legal remedies to , the liberal cancellation game . This game is the informal process by which individuals and companies deter dissent and enforce conformity of thought and expression by threatening and sometimes destroying the livelihood of dissenters . One of the conservative principles we aspire to is individual choice , manifesting in not interfering with the choices of individuals and companies over who they do business with . This often means a conservative is stifled or fired .\nBut another conservative principle is freedom of expression .

The lib objection sounds plausible , until you understand that individuals and companies punishing you by preventing you from earning a livelihood is as much of a punishment as the government coming and punishing you under criminal law \u2013 except in the cancellation kangaroo court you have no rights , no due process , and no appeal . And , in fact , this is not even an accurate representation of the allegedly operative principle .
