Amid growing concerns over racial inequality in the criminal justice system , \u201c civil asset forfeiture \u201d is facing renewed scrutiny .\nOn June 25 , Sens . Rand Paul , Angus King , Mike Crapo , and Mike Lee reintroduced their bill , the \u201c Fifth Amendment Integrity Restoration Act , \u201d to limit civil asset forfeiture and restore due process rights .\nThrough civil asset forfeiture , federal and state-level law enforcement can seize private property they merely suspect is related to some criminal activity . Examples of seized property include cash , vehicles , and even homes . No charges or convictions are required for police to confiscate this property . ( Alternatively , in the less-common process of criminal asset forfeiture , a conviction is required . ) In an inversion of the principle of \u201c innocent until proven guilty , \u201d Americans must pursue a lengthy , complicated , and costly appeal process to get their property back .\nAccording to the public interest law firm the Institute for Justice ( IJ ) , the Department of Justice takes in roughly $ 4.5 billion annually from civil asset forfeiture .
