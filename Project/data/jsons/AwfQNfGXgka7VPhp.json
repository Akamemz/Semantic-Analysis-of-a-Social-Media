The terrorist attacks on Paris and heightened tensions with Russia have refocused the GOP presidential field on the RJC\u2019s top concerns \u2014 foreign policy and national security \u2014 adding uncertainty to an already unpredictable primary that lacks a consensus front-runner.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a moment in the post-Paris atmosphere for the candidate to deliver something big and major, because people are going to be paying attention,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary and RJC board member who has helped organize the event. \u201cThis audience is pretty sophisticated, politically involved and they\u2019ve heard a lot of speeches before.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s fair to say this audience will be up for grabs if the race continues on these current lines \u2014 and it\u2019s a real opportunity for these candidates to win some support if they can demonstrate some depth of understanding on policy issues.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s certainly the case for Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, but for Jeb Bush, this event is an exercise in damage control. Many of the RJC board members scheduled to attend have already committed to a candidate, and some are now shopping for a plan B, especially those who threw their support behind Bush early on.\n\n\u201cMost of the people I speak to, none of them regard Jeb Bush as politically alive,\u201d said a longtime RJC board member based in New York City, who requested anonymity to speak freely. \u201cA lot of people on the RJC were very early committed to Jeb because of friendships and relationships. Now that Jeb has run out of steam, I don\u2019t know where any of them stand.\n\n\u201cMost people I know now are talking up Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz,\u201d he continued.\n\nDonald Trump, whose rambunctious projection of strength has kept him atop the polls for months, is also set to attend the RJC event, although he does not have strong support from many of its members.\n\nBen Carson, another outsider who was positioned near the front of the pack until the recent events overseas unmasked his lack of knowledge about foreign policy, is also scheduled to attend.\n\nSeveral of Bush\u2019s most prominent Jewish supporters will host a breakfast meeting on the sidelines of the RJC forum on behalf of his Right to Rise super PAC, which will look to convince supporters it\u2019s worth staying the course and waiting for the group to spend more of its $100 million war chest on TV ads (thus far, the group\u2019s first $24 million in ads has done nothing to move Bush\u2019s numbers).\n\nFormer House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a fundraising juggernaut with strong RJC ties who was brought into the fold earlier this year as a campaign co-chairman, will address attendees along with Right to Rise executive director Mike Murphy. Both are set to update attendees on Right to Rise\u2019s efforts on Bush\u2019s behalf and its view of the GOP primary, in which Bush continues to lag Trump, Carson, Rubio and Cruz.\n\n\u201cObviously, it\u2019s to bring everyone up to date and to cultivate anybody who hasn\u2019t made a decision yet,\u201d said Fred Zeidman, an RJC member and Bush supporter from Houston who noted that no donation is required to attend the breakfast. \u201cIt\u2019s never been portrayed to be a fundraiser.\u201d\n\nNearly every GOP candidate will be in town to speak to and take questions from moderator Matt Brooks, even long-shots like George Pataki and Jim Gilmore.\n\nBut the real battle is between Bush, thought to be the establishment front-runner when the year began, and Rubio and Cruz, who are ascendant now.\n\nThursday night, following the event, Rubio will hold a fundraiser in Washington looking to consolidate support from RJC members. Cruz will do the same thing in New York City.\n\nAlthough billionaire Paul Singer has already thrown his support behind Rubio, and Sheldon Adelson is reportedly likely to follow suit, Bush\u2019s super PAC believes it can make a compelling argument to RJC members in town for meetings that the war chest the group amassed in the first half of the year will be able to engineer a comeback \u2014 and that Bush, as a candidate, stands to do better as voters focus more on sobering issues like national security.\n\nBush, based on the list of hosts for the 7:30 a.m. meeting Thursday, already has solid support from a number of RJC board members.
