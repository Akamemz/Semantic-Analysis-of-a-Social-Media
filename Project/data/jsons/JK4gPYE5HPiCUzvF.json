Their positioning last night , as in the recent Houston debate , was symbiotic . One would punch at Trump and land some blows , then the the other would follow-through , maintaining pressure on the billionaire . A few additional thoughts on each candidate : He was sharp , focused , and ruthless throughout the event , turning Trump attacks into effective counter-assaults . His strongest moments were pressing Trump hard on his multiple donations to Hillary Clinton 's 2008 presidential campaign , a theme he tied in to several subsequent answers . He was also prosecutorial in his insistence that Trump allow the New York Times to release audio of an off-the-record conversation about immigration . Trump refused several times . He also took a Trump taunt about polling and turned it into a key point . Trump touted a CNN poll indicating that he holds a very large national lead in the Republican primary . Cruz countered with that exact same poll , which shows that both he and Rubio lead Hilary Clinton in that survey 's general election ballot question , whereas Trump loses handily . Even when he was n't savaging Trump , Cruz offered poised and commanding answers across a litany of issues . His response upbraiding decades of failed left-wing leadership in the city of Detroit was powerful , as were his points about the Supreme Court . Very strong night for him.As usual , the Floridian performed ably on the debate stage , challenging and prodding Donald Trump repeatedly -- while laying off Cruz ( who returned the courtesy ) . His feistiness in the early moments of the debate set the tone , calling Trump out for always responding to substantive criticism with personal , superficial answers . Trump confirmed this critique over and over . Rubio was especially aggressive in blasting Trump on his failed scam university , at one point baiting the billionaire into admitting that he 'd refunded `` many '' dissatisfied customers . This , after Trump misleadingly insisted that 98 percent of students were pleased with their experience , and falsely claiming an A rating from the Better Business Bureau . In the waning years of Trump University 's existence , it received D and D-minus ratings . Like Cruz , Rubio was fluid and conversant on a wide array of issues , often circling back to Trump 's lack of seriousness and specific knowledge . One of the funniest moments of the debate came when Cruz ridiculed Trump for his constant interruptions , encouraging him to `` breathe . '' After a joking exchange about yoga breaking out on stage , Rubio interjected , `` he 's very flexible , '' referring to a previous answer from Trump . Clever and nimble . The reason Cruz won over Rubio is that the latter seemed a little more fatigued than usual at times , and occasionally appeared to cross a line into petty bickering . Doing so rattled Trump , but set up Cruz for more effective answers . Sitting in the CPAC debate watch party ( hosted by \u2588\u2588\u2588 Media ) there was a palpable sense among the large anti-Trump majority that the two young Senators ' alliance ought to expand beyond the debate stage.He may not have a path to the nomination even if he wins Ohio , but the governor played his hand extremely well last night . Over and over again , he returned to his core message : While these guys bicker and insult each other , Americans want an adult with a proven record of actually helping people and accomplishing things -- and that 's me . That 's been his schtick for months . It felt timely and compelling on that stage last . And according to Frank Luntz 's focus group , Kasich 's tone and message scored.For the second consecutive debate , he was exposed as a policy ... well , lightweight , both by his rivals and by Fox News moderators .
