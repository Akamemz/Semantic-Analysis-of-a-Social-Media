This is a call in the dark night saying , \u2018 Look , guys , let \u2019 s change . We have to adapt or die . \u2019 \u201d\nIn the state that controls the single biggest pot of electoral votes , Wayne Lindholm , president of the Lincoln Club of Orange County , which has served as a rich source of funds for the GOP over the years and whose members have included Richard Nixon and John Wayne , summed up the party \u2019 s challenge more bluntly : \u201c We need to break the image of being just old white guys . \u201d\nThis state used to be Republican territory , producing Nixon , Ronald Reagan and other GOP stalwarts up through the late 1980s , when dramatic demographic trends began to eat away at the conservative voter base .\nThat has been the case in Orange County . Louis DeSipio , a professor of Hispanic studies at the University of California , Irvine , said Nixon wouldn \u2019 t recognize his former stomping grounds .\nIn 1980 , the state \u2019 s population was 65 percent white , 23 percent Hispanic and 10 percent Asian . Fast-forward to today , and of the state \u2019 s estimated 38 million people , 34 percent are Hispanic , 19 percent are Asian and 43 percent are white .\nThat is a problem for a party that has won elections primarily on the backs of white voters . The result : Democrats control the governorship , both U.S. Senate seats and large majorities in both houses of the state Legislature . George H.W . Bush , in 1988 , was the last Republican to carry the Golden State in a presidential election .\n\u201c The white electorate on which [ Republicans ] have relied for many years is growing much more slowly than the non-white electorate , \u201d Mr. DeSipio said .\nRelying on white voters isn \u2019 t working for the Republican Party nationally , either .\nIts 2012 presidential nominee , Mitt Romney , won 59 percent of the white vote , a higher percentage than Ronald Reagan did in 1980 when he defeated Democrat Jimmy Carter . But most minority voters roundly rejected Mr. Romney , and that cost him the White House .\nPresident Obama won the votes of 73 percent of Asians and 71 percent of Hispanics nationally , and 72 percent of the Hispanic vote and 79 percent of the Asian vote in California .\nMr. Romney \u2019 s loss , in a race that many strategists felt he should win , sent Republican leaders scrambling for answers .\nIn an election postmortem , the Republican National Committee found that trouble winning minority votes was a key stumbling block .\nMr. Steel , a former head of the California Republican Party , is among those making the case that the GOP must field and , more important , elect minority candidates .\n\u201c If the party is to be robust and be a player in California , they are going to have to make some absolutely fundamental changes in their marketing approach , \u201d Mr. Steel said . \u201c The dynamic , fast-growing Asian population needs to be brought in wholesale , and the best way to do that is have a whole lot of Asian-Americans run for local and state offices who are Republican Asians . \u201d\nMr. Steel said the party also must invest more into minority outreach .\nHe points to a project he spearheaded in 2012 when he raised $ 50,000 as part of an outreach effort in Nevada that included a bilingual phone bank and mailers in four Asian languages promoting Mr. Romney . Exit polls suggested that the limited investment paid off : Mr. Romney pulled in 47 percent of Nevada \u2019 s Asian and Pacific-American vote , compared with 26 percent nationwide .\nSome analysts warn that the Republican foray into identity politics can go only so far . They say the chief problems are the party \u2019 s stances on issues that are key to winning minority votes .\n\u201c The question is going to be , \u2018 Are you in favor of legalization ? \u2019 \u201d said Roberto Suro , a professor at the University of Southern California \u2019 s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism who previously served as director of the Pew Hispanic Center . \u201c If the answer is , \u2018 Under no circumstances , \u2019 this is going to be hard . \u201d\nJack M. Guerrero , a Cudahy City Council member who serves as mayor and ran for the California Assembly in 2012 , said Republicans need to reformulate their message to argue that they are fighting for the little guy , and need to reassure people that the party does not want to scrap social safety net programs but rather make them more efficient and accountable .\nBut , he said , the \u201c elephant in the room \u201d for Hispanic voters is immigration .\nMr. Guerrero , who was elected to the City Council last year and is the son of Mexican immigrants , said his party needs to adopt a more respectful tone toward immigrants and reject the stances of high-profile Republicans such as Rep. Steve King of Iowa , who Hispanics see as anti-immigrant .\n\u201c Those of us that are a lot more sensible need to stand up to that , \u201d Mr. Guerrero said .\nHe also said the party needs to embrace legalization for at least some illegal immigrants , including a pathway to citizenship \u201c even if it will take you 15 years . \u201d\n\u201c If we present a proposition like that , we can get Latinos onboard , \u201d he said . \u201c If we don \u2019 t get past that option , then it is all on the messenger eventually . It is someone like me . We will survive only by propping up Republican exceptionals out there [ who are ] able to convince constituents that , except for [ immigration ] , they are Republicans . \u201d\nRep. Dana Rohrabacher , a California Republican who is backing Mrs. Steel and some of the other minority candidates , made it clear that getting rank-and-file Republicans to embrace legalization is difficult .\n\u201c I will never vote to legalize the status of people who come here illegally , \u201d Mr. Rohrabacher said at a campaign stop , with Mrs. Steel at his side . \u201c It is an insult to immigrants who came in legally , like Michelle . \u201d\nThe Republican Party \u2019 s immigration problem in California stems back to the 1990s , when Gov . Pete Wilson led an initiative , passed by voters , that cracked down on illegal immigrants \u2019 use of many state social services . The law was invalidated by a court , and a subsequent Democratic governor halted appeals , leaving the ruling in place .\nThe political damage came quickly and went beyond Hispanics , said Charles Kim of Fullerton , whose wife , Young Kim , is running for a seat in the California Assembly . The initiative , known as Proposition 187 , turned off Asian voters as well , he said .\n\u201c That is the turning point for when they started losing interest in the Republican Party , \u201d Mr. Kim said . \u201c Democrats , they hug you first . I disagree with them , but they welcome me . I agree with Republicans , but they don \u2019 t welcome me . That is the feeling we have . \u201d\nThe biography on the \u201c About Young Kim \u201d page of his wife \u2019 s campaign website makes no mention of her party affiliation .\nMrs. Steel doesn \u2019 t shy away from her immigrant experience when she talks with voters .\nShe was born in South Korea , and her family moved to Japan , where her father served as a diplomat . After her father died , Mrs. Steel \u2019 s mother packed up her three daughters and moved to the United States , where she learned her third language : English .\nSpeaking with a thick accent , which forces some people to lean forward and listen more intently , Mrs. Steel jokes about how she figured it was an American dating tradition to bring along a best friend after Mr. Rohrabacher , now a congressman , tagged along with her husband on their first outing .\nShe said her desire to run for public office was fueled by the way her mother was treated by the state tax agency , the California Board of Equalization , after she opened a clothing store in Los Angeles .\n\u201c She got harassed and abused by tax agency , \u201d Mrs. Steel said . \u201c So I had a grudge against them . She paid taxes that she didn \u2019 t owe , plus collecting interest on top of it . \u201d\nMrs. Steel , who graduated from Pepperdine University and received an MBA from the University of Southern California , won one of the five seats on the same tax board in 2006 , making her one of the senior ranking Republican officials in the state government .\nAnother minority Republican hopeful , Janet Nguyen , an Orange County supervisor running for state Senate , said her family benefited from social welfare programs after emigrating from Vietnam . She said that is an experience more Republicans need to understand .\n\u201c When people start saying things like those on welfare are \u2018 milking the system , \u2019 well , guess what ? That is offensive to me , even though I am not on welfare . That system helped me get to where I am today , \u201d Ms. Nguyen said .\n\u201c However , we are rebuilding the party and we are making sure that we are reaching out , \u201d she said . \u201c There are now individuals like myself who are more outspoken about issues and also are talking to Republican leaders about these issues and how we deal with it . \u201d\nRepublicans hope Mrs. Nguyen can help them tap into the Vietnamese voting bloc . They estimate there are 40,000 unregistered Vietnamese in that Senate district , and they want to get at least 10,000 of them registered and turned out to vote .\nThe thinking is simple : If they can register Vietnamese voters , even if they sign up as Democrats or decline to pick a party , the new voters are likely to back the Vietnamese candidate .\n\u201c This is an old tactic , \u201d Mr. Steel said . \u201c It used to be the Italians . It used to be the Irish . It is a tribalistic thing . It is very effective and so that is kind of an early 20th century phenomena .
