    "content": "When House Speaker Nancy Pelosi withdrew her original State of the Union invitation , preventing President Trump from delivering the address as scheduled on January 29 , she was probably surprised when he responded with such calm forbearance : \u201c This is her prerogative . I will do the address when the shutdown is over. \u201d By the time Trump finished the rescheduled speech Tuesday evening , she no doubt understood that her petty political ploy had been a blunder . Trump , being no mean showman , had long since realized that the highly publicized delay would increase public interest in the speech \u2014 and that is precisely what happened .\nBy the time he entered the House chamber , it was already obvious that the national audience would very likely exceed last year \u2019 s larger-than-usual viewership for such speeches . This is not typical for the SOTU address . The normal pattern is a reasonably large audience for a president \u2019 s first address , followed by a gradual decline in public interest each year thereafter . This was certainly true for Trump \u2019 s predecessor . Tuesday evening \u2019 s speech , however , drew a larger audience than did the President \u2019 s 2018 address . According to a report in the Hill , broadcast TV numbers from Nielsen show the audience share was 10 percent over last year \u2019 s speech :\nThe four major broadcast outlets \u2014 CBS , NBC , ABC and Fox \u2014 combined for a 16.3 overnight rating during the address Tuesday night , which could result in total viewership of approximately 49 million when final numbers , to include the cable news networks and other outlets , are in later Wednesday .\nMoreover , CBS and CNN conducted polls of public reaction to Trump \u2019 s words and the vast majority of viewers liked what they heard . The CBS/YouGov poll found that 76 percent of the public approved of the address , including 97 percent of Republicans and a whopping 82 percent of Independents . And a majority of viewers agreed that the President accomplished one of his primary goals for the address \u2014 improving national unity . According to CBS , \u201c Fifty-six percent of Americans who watched tonight feel the president \u2019 s speech will do more to unite the country. \u201d On specific issues , an unambiguous majority of viewers agreed with the President .\nAnd , in more than one case , their answers debunked Democrat talking points . A particularly glaring example of this was the public \u2019 s response to his points on illegal immigration . The Democrats have consistently attempted to convince the public that President Trump and his administration is exaggerating the seriousness of the problem . They have frequently accused him of unnecessarily stoking racism and xenophobia in order to \u201c manufacture a crisis. \u201d Indeed , this is the primary basis for their consistent yet evidence-free claims that he himself is a racist . That is not , however , how the Americans who watched last night \u2019 s SOTU address view the issue :\nMost viewers had a favorable opinion of what Mr. Trump had to say about immigration.\u2026 From what they heard tonight , 71 percent of speech-watchers think there is a crisis at the southern border .\nIt goes without saying , of course , that such unexpected and unwelcome findings forced the people at CBS to downplay the significance of their own poll . To that end , they devoted a lot of irrelevant verbiage to the number of Republicans who watched President Trump \u2019 s speech :\nIn the latest CBS national poll released last month , 25 percent of Americans identified themselves as Republicans . Among those who watched Tuesday night \u2019 s address , that figure was 43 percent .\nOddly , the folks at CBS neglect to explain how that datum applies to the extraordinarily high approval figures among the Independents who watched the President \u2019 s speech . Moreover , on other issues , the approval ratings on Trump \u2019 s speech are also too high to explain away :\nOn North Korea , 78 percent of speech-watchers think a second meeting between Mr. Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is a good idea.\u2026 Most viewers [ 74 percent ] approved of Mr. Trump \u2019 s comments on the Middle East .\nThe analysts at CNN also conducted a survey of the people who watched the State of the Union address , and found higher rates of approval than they evidently expected . It \u2019 s unlikely that these number crunchers were pleased to find that the percentage of viewers who rated the speech as \u201c very positive \u201d or \u201c somewhat positive \u201d was identical to the CBS result \u2014 76 percent . Not coincidentally , CNN also tried to explain that away with the \u201c more Republicans watched \u201d argument . But the positive effect of Trump \u2019 s performance was very real and clearly taking its toll on Speaker Pelosi as the speech went on . Former Speaker Newt Gingrich felt her pain :\nShe had to listen politely.\u2026 and pretend to be a good hostess ( the President is the guest of the House ) . When even her most radical new members began standing and applauding , she must have experienced a bit of despair .\nThis was obvious to anyone watching Madam Speaker gnaw her lip and writhe for the 82 minutes Trump spoke . To paraphrase the immortal P.G . Wodehouse , it was clear that , if not actually disgruntled , she was far from being gruntled .
