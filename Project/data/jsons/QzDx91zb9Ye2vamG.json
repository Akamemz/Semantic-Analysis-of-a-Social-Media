At least not this time .\nIn Iowa , Jane Gasperi , a retired Des Moines real estate agent , is still too shocked to consider which other candidate she might back . Right up until she heard the news , she had been convinced , \u201c My candidate is going to be on the ticket . \u2019 \u201d\nStill the White House may not be out of the question for the former California prosecutor and attorney general . Mr. Shrum describes her as a \u201c serious possibility \u201d for the vice presidential nominee .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think she ever developed a coherent message . You could see that in the tag lines that kept changing . I think the last one was \u2018 Justice for All , \u2019 \u201d says former Democratic consultant Robert Shrum .\nIn a letter to staff and supporters on Tuesday , Ms. Harris explained that her campaign simply did not have the finances to continue . But a lack of funding is a symptom , not a cause , and political analysts all point to one cause to explain her campaign \u2019 s demise : the lack of a consistent , core message .\nOn Monday evening , Kamala Harris \u2019 Des Moines headquarters was humming with activity . Millennials sat with laptops at folding tables , twinkly Christmas lights above their heads . Purple and yellow \u201c For the People \u201d signs spelled out \u201c Iowa \u201d in a giant floor-to-ceiling display .\nThe campaign was hitting all of its outreach targets to finish in the top three in the Iowa caucuses , Senator Harris \u2019 state communications director said over breakfast with a reporter Tuesday morning , promising to follow up about a candidate meet-and-greet in Decorah .\nNot long after , she texted : \u201c The office is closed . Sorry . \u201d\nThe suspension of the California senator \u2019 s presidential bid shocked her supporters here and around the country . Yes , her poll numbers had plummeted , and recent media reports had portrayed a poorly run campaign plagued with internal divisions . But she had performed well in the last debate , and was \u201c all in \u201d in Iowa , packing the house at a recent event in Indianola .\n\u201c Her momentum was changing , \u201d says Janelle Rettig , the Johnson County supervisor who just endorsed Ms. Harris on Sunday .\nIn a letter to staff and supporters on Tuesday , Ms. Harris explained that her campaign simply did not have the finances to continue . \u201c I \u2019 m not a billionaire . I can \u2019 t fund my own campaign , \u201d she wrote , in a subtle dig to ultrawealthy late entrants Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer .\nBut a lack of funding is a symptom , not a cause , and political analysts all point to one cause to explain her campaign \u2019 s demise : the lack of a consistent , core message .\n\u201c Senator Harris never really had a rationale for her campaign , \u201d says Phil Trounstine , co-editor and publisher of Calbuzz . \u201c She had positions , but she never really had convictions . And people saw that , which is why she never caught on . \u201d\nShe bowed out in time to remove her name from the California ballot , saving herself from an embarrassing showing and perhaps making her a more viable vice presidential pick , says Mr. Trounstine . But \u201c Kamala was an inherently weak candidate , because she \u2019 s a show horse \u201d \u2013 albeit \u201c a good one . \u201d\nSenator Harris launched her campaign with a bang , drawing an enthusiastic crowd of more than 20,000 people at her January kickoff in Oakland . The former California prosecutor and attorney general had achieved rock-star status after her sharp questioning at last year \u2019 s Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh . A gifted , personable speaker and personification of the American immigrant dream \u2013 her mother was from India and her father from Jamaica \u2013 she generated positive reviews from voters and the media .\n\u201c The campaign coverage was absolutely glowing , until it wasn \u2019 t , \u201d says a former Harris staffer . As reporters and voters kicked the tires , many found them deflated . \u201c She has never been tremendously strong on policy , once you get down into the details . \u201d\nThe senator changed positions on \u201c Medicare for All , \u201d one of the most controversial issues in the campaign . At the June debate , she got a boost after zinging front-runner Joe Biden over school busing , but then adjusted her position on that as well . For a time , she seemed to be running in the progressive lane , then moved more to the moderate lane .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think she ever developed a coherent message . You could see that in the tag lines that kept changing . I think the last one was \u2018 Justice for All , \u2019 \u201d says former Democratic consultant Robert Shrum , who now teaches at the University of Southern California . Telling voters that she can \u201c prosecute \u201d Donald Trump is \u201c not a sufficient message in this primary . \u201d\nSenator Harris is not the first upper-tier candidate to drop out . Former Texas Rep. Beto O \u2019 Rourke , who almost defeated Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018 , also entered the presidential race with high expectations , only to exit before the voting began .\nLike Ms. Harris , \u201c he had a problem defining himself , \u201d says Dianne Bystrom , the former director of the Carrie Chapman Catt Center for Women and Politics at Iowa State University in Ames . Mr. O \u2019 Rourke wound up focusing on gun control after this summer \u2019 s shooting in El Paso , but it wasn \u2019 t enough . He dropped out Nov. 1 for lack of funding .\nDr. Bystrom , who heard Senator Harris speak in Council Bluffs , Iowa , a few weeks ago , says her message of pay equity for women and teachers was strong but failed to resonate . That , combined with poor polling , and the spate of negative media coverage about internal campaign troubles , sunk her . \u201c People don \u2019 t want to give money to people they think are not viable . \u201d\nAn hour flipping through TV channels in Des Moines on a recent weeknight reveals ads for Mr. Steyer and South Bend , Indiana , Mayor Pete Buttigieg ( who has shot to first place in recent polls there ) \u2013 as well as for former New York Mayor Bloomberg , despite the fact that he \u2019 s not even competing in the early states .\nThe big spenders in the race rankle some Harris supporters . Jane Gasperi , a retired Des Moines real estate agent , had planned to host a house party for Senator Harris on Monday evening , but says she had to cancel because of difficulties in getting people to respond to an unrecognized number .\nStory Hinckley/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Jane Gasperi , seen here in front of her home in Des Moines , Iowa , Dec. 3 , canceled her house party for Kamala Harris on Monday evening .

And then there \u2019 s Bloomberg out there with all of his money , \u201d she says . \u201c I \u2019 m just so sad that it all came down to money . \u201d\nAt a coffee shop in Iowa City , Ms. Rettig , the county supervisor , explains how she and her wife read all of the candidates \u2019 books and interviewed them before endorsing Ms. Harris .

And her prosecutorial experience could be a huge plus , since often it \u2019 s the vice presidential candidate who gets tapped to go on the attack .\nVice President Biden already appears to have glossed over their debate sparring over busing . From his \u201c No Malarkey \u201d bus tour in Iowa on Wednesday , he said the contest lost \u201c a really good one \u201d in Senator Harris , saying she is \u201c capable of being president or vice president or on the Supreme Court or attorney general . \u201d\nAs for her followers , at least one of them , Tracy Van Houten , a Democratic party activist in Los Angeles County , says she will support Massachusetts Sen.
