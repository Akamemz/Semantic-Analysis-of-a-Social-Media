It \u2019 s pretty clear that the ban will have a limited impact on most temporary visa holders , it \u2019 s a lot less clear what it \u2019 s going to mean for refugees \u2014 the Trump administration will have a lot of leeway to interpret the court \u2019 s ruling .\nBut on some level , the \u201c travel ban \u201d itself was always more of a symbolic gesture than a real one . The changes that President Trump \u2019 s executive order threatens to make to visa and refugee admissions are huge \u2014 with the temporary bans providing a cover for a permanent shift in how the US decides who gets to come here . The reason the \u201c ban \u201d part matters is that it \u2019 s what President Trump wanted all along . Now , he \u2019 s gotten what he wanted , and the whole world knows it .\nIt \u2019 s hard to see that as anything other than a win . And it \u2019 s harder still to dismiss the idea that the symbolic victory will itself have real-world effects .\nTo Donald Trump , a symbolic victory is the only kind that matters\nDonald Trump himself certainly sees Monday \u2019 s Supreme Court action as a victory .\nVery grateful for the 9-O decision from the U. S. Supreme Court . We must keep America SAFE ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) June 26 , 2017\nHe \u2019 s wrong in most of the particulars ( it wasn \u2019 t a \u201c decision ; \u201d it \u2019 s necessarily the case that the ruling was unanimous ; etc . ) But it makes sense that he \u2019 d greet it as a victory , despite the fact that many visa-holders will still be allowed into the US ( and even if most refugees are allowed to join them ) . Because he now gets to put into place something called a \u201c ban , \u201d which was clearly all he wanted to begin with .\nPeople , the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want , but I am calling it what we need and what it is , a TRAVEL BAN ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) June 5 , 2017\nEverything we know about the history of the travel ban \u2014 from its early development before the inauguration , masterminded by Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller , to its hasty rollout and embarrassing post-facto revisions , to the \u201c watered-down \u201d version issued in March \u2014 indicates that Donald Trump is not intimately aware of the details of the executive orders he has signed on the subject , and has not been particularly involved in the process of developing them . ( Indeed , he has openly blamed his own Department of Justice for the revised order he signed in March . ) But he really doesn \u2019 t like it when judges have stopped his administration from doing what he thinks it should be able to do , and he really likes calling the policy a \u201c ban . \u201d\nThis is par for the course for President Donald Trump : His interest in policy is limited to an interest in getting \u201c a win \u201d on something .\nAs a real-estate tycoon , back in his Art of the Deal days , \u201c Money ( was ) n't important except as proof that he is more successful than his peers , \u201d \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Zack Beauchamp wrote during the campaign , and `` \u2018 Deals \u2019 are literal codifications of his victories over other people. \u201d Something similar \u2019 s true now , but for \u201c money \u201d and \u201c deals \u201d read bills and executive orders .\nIt \u2019 s why Trump pressed the House of Representatives to take a vote on the American Health Care Act before they had majority support for it ; held a Rose Garden reception when they tried again and passed the chamber ; then called the bill \u201c mean \u201d when he realized there were political downsides to it .\nIt \u2019 s why his administration has scurried to lower the bar for what counts as a \u201c wall \u201d on the US/Mexico border , and who \u2019 s expected to pay for it . The point isn \u2019 t that Donald Trump believes fervently that there needs to be a concrete barrier along the entire border . It \u2019 s that Donald Trump wants something to point to and call a \u201c wall , \u201d and the details maybe should be left to people who have thought harder about the subject .\nAs much as the policies being perpetuated by the Trump administration matter , they \u2019 re not the sum total of his presidency \u2019 s effect on the world . The symbolic victories are important politically for Trump \u2014 they \u2019 re promises he can tell his base he \u2019 s kept .\nThe Supreme Court just made it easier for the Trump administration to cast refugees as enemies\nOne of the most consistent themes in the rhetoric of Donald Trump is that Americans can \u2019 t trust people who come from unstable parts of the world \u2014 even , and perhaps especially , when those people claim to be fleeing persecution .\nWhen the world was horrified by the Syrian refugee crisis in 2015 , Trump warned of a \u201c Trojan horse \u201d of ISIS infiltrators taking advantage of American hospitality . Every time a terrorist attack is perpetuated in Europe and it appears a Muslim might be the perpetrator , President Trump has cited it hastily as a reason his \u201c ban \u201d is needed \u2014 reinforcing the idea , often contrary to the reality of who the attackers actually were , that there \u2019 s a critical mass of terrorists seeking to sneak into the US for the purpose of doing us harm , and that America \u2019 s instincts of generosity are a mere soft-headed liability .\nThe federal judges who \u2019 ve ruled against the Trump administration on the travel ban \u2014 the ones whose rulings were partially stayed by the Supreme Court on Monday \u2014 have been extremely skeptical that the Trump administration is making its decisions based on thorough assessments of national security , rather than simply on fear . But the Supreme Court showed much more deference . It granted , by default , the administration \u2019 s assertion that national security requires closer vetting of refugees around the world \u2014 and simply tried to weigh that against the claims of harm suffered by people and organizations in the US if their relatives , employees and students weren \u2019 t allowed on American shores .\nThe balance it struck \u2014 that the travel ban applies only to people without a \u201c bona fide relationship \u201d with an American individual or entity \u2014 is only partially explained in the Monday order , and is almost certainly going to unleash a flood of lawsuits as various people try to establish \u201c bona fide \u201d relationships over government denials . Hopefully , the \u201c bona fide relationship \u201d standard won \u2019 t seep into other areas of immigration law , which is already strewn with subjective standards that are only intermittently subject to judicial review . But even if it isn \u2019 t , the Supreme Court has validated the idea that people who don \u2019 t already have connections in the US , and want to come here anyway , should be viewed with a certain amount of suspicion .\nThis idea is already part of the way that America looks at foreigners , and especially refugees . But it couldn \u2019 t be more different from the refugee program \u2019 s purpose . Unlike every other immigration program in the US , refugees aren \u2019 t brought here on the basis of being good for America . They \u2019 re brought here because their homes and lives have been destroyed by persecution and they deserve the chance to settle down and create new , permanent lives for themselves \u2014 not because they \u2019 re particularly worthy , but because they \u2019 re humans .\nWhen the Supreme Court weighed judicial standing ( of the groups challenging the travel ban ) against security , it determined that for people merely fleeing persecution \u2014 the people for whom the refugee program was designed \u2014 security trumped .\nThis administration has banged the drum of distrust of refugees whenever it can \u2014 and even when it can \u2019 t . It \u2019 s just gotten another opportunity to remind America that someone who merely wants to flee persecution should not be trusted .\nThe Supreme Court just cut off the court-led \u201c resistance \u201d at the knees\nThe reason the Supreme Court deferred to the Trump administration on security is simple : when the president says something is a \u201c national security threat , \u201d it \u2019 s pretty well-established that the courts aren \u2019 t supposed to second-guess him .\nIt \u2019 s just that , when the president in question is Donald Trump , the federal courts that had previously heard the travel-ban cases weren \u2019 t exactly willing to extend him the benefit of the doubt .\nThe string of losses that the Trump administration suffered in the cases against both the initial travel ban in February and the revised version this spring were satisfying to the administration \u2019 s critics , and it was easy to understand why the courts weren \u2019 t deferring to the Trump administration when Trump and key advisers had a tendency to carelessly undermine the arguments their lawyers were making in court .\nAt the same time , though , it was pretty clear that a president who wasn \u2019 t Trump \u2014 who had never promised a \u201c Muslim ban , \u201d or who didn \u2019 t have a tendency to insult and threaten judges \u2014 would have had an easier time making the same case . The constitutional questions posed in the travel-ban cases really weren \u2019 t open-and-shut , and the lower courts \u2019 rulings had a tendency to make them seem that way . It wasn \u2019 t hard to conclude that judges were being , at least in part , motivated by a desire to stand up for the system of checks and balances against a president who didn \u2019 t appear to respect them much .\nBut given the choice between defending the judicial branch and following existing tradition , the Supreme Court chose the latter on Monday .\nMaybe , when the court takes up the travel-ban case in full in the fall \u2014 if it hasn \u2019 t been rendered moot in the meantime , of course \u2014 some or all of the justices will refuse to grant the traditional deference to the Trump administration , and will push the administration \u2019 s lawyers as hard as lower-court judges have . But on Monday , when they had to make a snap decision , they determined that it wasn \u2019 t appropriate to allow skepticism of the administration to keep Trump from doing what he claimed he needed to do .\nThe lower courts \u2019 harshness toward the travel ban was the clearest sign that at least some federal judges thought of themselves as part of the resistance . Monday \u2019 s ruling is the clearest sign that , at least for now and at least on the whole , the Supreme Court does not .\nSending people a message they \u2019 re not wanted is likely to change their behavior\nOne downside of calling Trump \u2019 s executive orders a \u201c Muslim ban \u201d is that Muslims beyond the handful of blacklisted countries might be under the misapprehension that they \u2019 re banned from entering the US ; the idea that there is something in the US called a \u201c travel ban \u201d in effect may be the only information many people have about it .\nThe version of the ban that \u2019 s going to go into effect starting on Thursday , in theory , shouldn \u2019 t deter anyone who has a \u201c bona fide relationship \u201d to someone or something in the US . Those people should , in theory , be allowed to apply for visas , receive them , and enter without incident . But that might not be an easy nuance to grasp .\nSomeone simply thinking , in the abstract , about applying to study abroad in the US or taking a business trip here might not stumble upon the right information that would explain to them that either of those circumstances count as \u201c bona fide relationships \u201d under the Supreme Court \u2019 s ruling .\nEven if they know the facts of the ruling on paper , they might be skeptical that it \u2019 ll be that easy for them in practice . The process of applying for a visa is often convoluted and arbitrary . A certain amount of suspicion that they \u2019 re going to have to jump through unwarranted hoops to prove a \u201c bona fide \u201d relationship might not be irrational .\nOr they \u2019 ll simply choose not to come to the US \u2014 because they have been sent the message , through the fact that there is a \u201c travel ban \u201d on certain people from certain countries and that the president of the United States is very proud of this fact , that they aren \u2019 t necessarily welcome here .\nIt would be a sensible decision on their part . It \u2019 s not their responsibility to deny the Trump administration a victory . But it would help the Trump administration and those who welcomed the travel ban get exactly what they wanted , in the final analysis : fewer people coming to the US from countries they find suspicious .",
