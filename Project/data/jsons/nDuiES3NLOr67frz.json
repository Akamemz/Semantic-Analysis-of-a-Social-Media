He said the way such sites present results is a \u201c very serious situation -- will be addressed . \u201d\nLater , in remarks at the White House , Mr. Trump said companies including Google , Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. are \u201c treading on very , very troubling territory \u201d and warned : \u201c They better be careful because you can \u2019 t do that to people . \u201d\nThe allegations come as some policy makers in Washington have voiced concerns about a number of practices by Google , a unit of Alphabet Inc. , including whether it is stifling competition and endangering the privacy of billions of users . Members of Congress questioned Google and other tech giants earlier this year over allegations that their platforms favored liberal voices over conservative ones .\nA Google spokeswoman said its search results aren \u2019 t biased toward a particular political ideology . \u201c We continually work to improve Google Search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment , \u201d she said in a statement .\nRelated Video \u200bGoogle handles 90 % of the world 's internet searches , and it increasingly is promoting a single answer for many questions .

On Sept. 5 , executives including Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey and Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg are scheduled to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee about election interference . Other issues , such as alleged bias , are also expected to be raised during the hearing .\nKent Walker , Google \u2019 s senior vice president for global affairs , planned to join the hearing . But last week , Sen. Richard Burr ( R. , N.C. ) , who heads that committee , said he had rejected Google \u2019 s offer to send Mr. Walker , apparently in an effort to force a more-senior executive to appear .\nIn his tweets Tuesday , Mr. Trump questioned whether Google \u2019 s purported political bias may be \u201c illegal \u201d but didn \u2019 t elaborate on what he meant when he said the issue will be addressed .\nA White House official said the Republican president has made clear he wants his administration to look into the issue and several officials were tasked on Tuesday with finding options for potential action against social media companies . \u201c It \u2019 s starting now , \u201d the official said .\nIt wasn \u2019 t known what steps Mr. Trump could take to put pressure on the companies besides continuing his public criticisms .

But the administration could target related issues to make life difficult for them .\nFor example , the White House could urge allies in Congress to change Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act , a landmark law that shields internet companies from liability for hosting content produced by others . It could also push for investigations of online privacy violations . Both issues have attracted support from Democrats as well as Republicans .\n\u201c It \u2019 s clear to me and to most people that there is not bias in search and there is not bias in social media , \u201d said Michael Beckerman , president and CEO of the Internet Association , which represents tech companies including Google on regulatory issues .
