Biden forced Democrats to revisit the # MeToo issue over the weekend as one of their own made it clear that she is unwilling to stay quiet for the good of the team .\nFormer Nevada state Assemblywoman Lucy Flores accused Mr. Biden , the putative front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination , in an op-ed article over the weekend of putting his hands on her shoulders , smelling her hair and planting a kiss on the back of her head during her 2014 campaign rally for lieutenant governor .\nOn Sunday , Ms. Flores described the incident , which Mr. Biden had said he did not recall , as \u201c disqualifying , \u201d given what she called his history of \u201c acting inappropriately with women \u201d and a political climate in which young Democratic \u201c foot soldiers \u201d like herself are no longer willing to \u201c keep our mouths shut . \u201d\n\u201c We \u2019 re often pressured to keep our mouths shut about anything , \u201d Ms. Flores told CNN \u2019 s \u201c State of the Union. \u201d \u201c We , as party loyalists , as party stalwarts , are foot soldiers for the party . We \u2019 re expected to , quote-unquote , keep our dirty laundry to ourselves . And it \u2019 s always in service to the party . \u201d\nMr. Biden , who has yet to declare his candidacy , responded by vowing to \u201c remain the strongest advocate I can be \u201d for women . The Biden camp posted multiple declarations of support from former female staffers and colleagues who vouched for his character .\n\u201c In my many years on the campaign trail and in public life , I have offered countless handshakes , hugs , expressions of affection , support and comfort , and not once , never , did I believe I acted inappropriately , \u201d Mr. Biden said . \u201c If it is suggested I did so , I will listen respectfully , but it was never my intention . \u201d\nSEE ALSO : Believe women ? Democrats not ready to disqualify Biden based on one allegation\nAt the same time , the accusation raised questions about whether the 76-year-old Delaware Democrat \u2019 s physical , press-the-flesh campaign style may become a liability in the # MeToo era .\n\u201c Joe Biden is a longtime American political figure who came from the fleshy world of \u2018 60s and \u2018 70s politics , when everybody started to hug and kiss , \u201d former Reagan White House speechwriter Peggy Noonan said on NBC \u2019 s \u201c Meet the Press. \u201d \u201c It was different from the \u2018 40s and \u2018 50s . We \u2019 re hugging . We \u2019 re kissing . All that stuff is going on . That \u2019 s part of his story right now . \u201d\nWell before the Flores accusation , Mr. Biden had gained a reputation for his close encounters with women , such as a 2015 episode in which he rested his hands on the shoulders of Stephanie Carter , wife of then-Defense Secretary Ashton Carter , and then whispered into her ear .\nSome of the encounters appeared friendly , others uncomfortable . White House counselor Kellyanne Conway pointed to a \u201c treasure trove \u201d of \u201c creepy Uncle Joe videos \u201d on the internet .\n\u201c I think Joe has a big problem here because he calls it an affectionate handshake , his party calls it completely inappropriate , \u201d Mrs. Conway said on \u201c Fox News Sunday . \u201d\nOf course , Mr. Trump has his own problems on that score . He has denied accusations that he engaged in unwanted touching or kissing with more than a dozen women , buttressed by his bragging on tape about being able to grab women by the genitals . But the hypocrisy risk is higher for Democrats , given their calls to \u201c believe women . \u201d\nMs. Flores agreed that the timing of her op-ed was political , spurred by Mr. Biden \u2019 s anticipated candidacy . She acknowledged that she supported Sen. Bernard Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primary and attended former Rep. Beto O \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s campaign kickoff Saturday in El Paso , Texas .\nAsked about Mr. Biden \u2019 s statement , Ms. Flores said , \u201c I \u2019 m glad that he \u2019 s willing to listen . I \u2019 m glad that he is clarifying his intentions , \u201d but \u201c my point was never about his intentions .\n\u201c And they shouldn \u2019 t be about his intentions , \u201d Ms. Flores said . \u201c It should be about the women on the receiving end of that behavior . And this isn \u2019 t the first time , and it wasn \u2019 t the only incident where he was acting inappropriately with women . \u201d\nShe emphasized that \u201c never do I claim that this rises to the level of a sexual assault or anything of that nature . \u201d\n\u201c What I am saying is that it \u2019 s completely inappropriate , that it does not belong in any kind of a professional setting , much less in politics , \u201d Ms. Flores said . \u201c That is something that we should consider when we are talking about the background of a person who is considering running for president . \u201d\nMany of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates reacted over the weekend by saying they believed Ms. Flores \u2014 or had no reason not to \u2014 and that only Mr. Biden could decide whether the allegation was \u201c disqualifying . \u201d\n\u201c I read the op-ed last night . I believe Lucy Flores , and Joe Biden needs to give an answer , \u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren , Massachusetts Democrat , said at the Heartland Forum in Iowa .\nFormer San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro , who was also at the Iowa forum , said , \u201c I believe Lucy Flores . I believe the vice president put a statement out today . He \u2019 s going to decide whether he \u2019 s going to run or not , and then the American people , if he does , will decide whether they support him or not . \u201d\nOn Capitol Hill , Senate Minority Whip Richard J. Durbin , Illinois Democrat , said he didn \u2019 t believe that a single accusation of inappropriate behavior should be enough to keep Mr. Biden out of the 2020 presidential race , where he leads the crowded field of would-be nominees in virtually every poll .\n\u201c Certainly one allegation is not disqualifying , but it should be taken seriously , \u201d Mr. Durbin said on NBC \u2019 s \u201c Meet the Press . \u201d\nA Quinnipiac University poll released Friday found Mr. Biden , who served two terms as President Barack Obama \u2019 s vice president , with the support of 29 percent of Democrats and Democrat-leaning voters , followed by Mr. Sanders , at 19 percent .\nMr. Sanders questioned whether Mr. Biden should be ruled out as a candidate based on one allegation .\n\u201c I think that \u2019 s a decision for the vice president to make , \u201d Mr. Sanders said on CBS \u2019 s \u201c Face the Nation. \u201d \u201c I \u2019 m not sure that one incident alone disqualifies anybody , but her point is absolutely right . This is an issue not just for Democrats or Republicans . The entire country has got to take this seriously .\nPolitical strategist Cornell Belcher , a former Democratic Party pollster , said he was confident that Mr. Biden \u2019 s potential candidacy would survive the accusation , which appeared Friday in an essay by Ms. Flores in New York magazine called \u201c An Awkward Kiss Changed How I Saw Joe Biden . \u201d\n\u201c The culture has fundamentally changed , which is a problem for a lot of our older candidates , who , to your point , came up in a culture that was very different , \u201d Mr. Belcher said on \u201c Meet the Press. \u201d \u201c But I think he can survive it .
