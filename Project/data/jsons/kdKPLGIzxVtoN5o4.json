In the highest bracket , Californians are paying 13.3 percent in state income taxes , and that money comes off the top when those high-earning Silicon Valley types are calculating federal taxes . In New York City , the Wall Street guys are paying 8.82 percent to the state and another 3.876 percent to the city , which lowers their taxable federal income by almost 13 percent on the marginal dollar .\nEliminating deductibility for state and local income taxes is of course politically satisfying for mean-spirited conservatives such as myself \u2014 it constitutes a very substantial tax increase on the sort of well-kept and comfortable lefty Californians and New Yorkers from whom we tend to hear more than maybe we really want to on all sorts of political issues . Rich Democrats in Santa Monica and on the Upper West Side think we should have higher taxes , and we knuckle-dragging right-wingers down in Texas and Florida disagree . This way , everybody gets what he wants .\nLike the mortgage-interest deduction , which the Trump plan unfortunately keeps ( the president loves his real estate and is the self-proclaimed \u201c king of debt \u201d ) , the deduction for state and local taxes was intended to be a benefit to the middle class , i.e. , the salt-of-the-earth voters who simultaneously are strongly in favor of an active welfare state and strongly disinclined to pay for it .

That \u2019 s not surprising : High-income households make a lot of money , often have larger mortgages ( at least in absolute terms ) , and , to no one \u2019 s surprise , pay most of the taxes , both at the federal level and at the state and local levels .

The federal government is not very good at social engineering : Its efforts to help low-income Americans with bad credit borrow money to buy houses they could not afford was a significant contributor to the subprime meltdown and financial crisis of 2008\u20132009 . Encouraging homeownership through subsidizing mortgage interest ( which is what that deduction actually does ) can encourage the wrong kind \u2014 the low-equity , high-interest kind \u2014 of homeownership .
