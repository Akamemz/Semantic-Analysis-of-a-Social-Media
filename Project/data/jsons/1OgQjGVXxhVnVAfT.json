Reports say he \u2019 d grown frustrated with Trump \u2019 s unwillingness to heed his legal advice , including his view that an interview with Mueller would be too risky .\nAnd less than a week after announcing that Trump was adding two new lawyers to his legal team , personal Trump attorney Jay Sekulow had to walk back the announcement , saying the two wouldn \u2019 t be working on the special counsel investigation after all because of \u201c conflicts \u201d with their other clients .\nWhite House lawyers Ty Cobb and Don McGahn work for Trump on issues tied to the Russia investigation , but both are on the taxpayer payroll , meaning they are responsible for protecting the office of the presidency , not Trump personally .
