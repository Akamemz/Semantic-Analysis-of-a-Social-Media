    "content": "For the first time , hospitals and insurers would be forced to disclose their secret negotiated rates under a far-reaching plan released Friday by the Trump administration .\nAdministration officials said the final rule will compel hospitals in 2021 to publicize the rates they negotiate with individual insurers for all services , including drugs , supplies , facility fees and care by doctors who work for the facility .\nThe administration proposed extending the disclosure requirement to the $ 670 billion health-insurance industry . Insurance companies and group health plans that cover employees would have to disclose negotiated rates , as well as previously paid rates for out-of-network treatment , in file formats that are computer-searchable , officials said .\nThe insurers , including Anthem Inc. and Cigna Corp. , would have to provide a transparency tool to give cost information to consumers in advance , senior administration officials said .\nThe requirements are more far-reaching than many industry leaders had expected and could upend commercial health-care markets , which are rife with complex systems of hidden charges and secret discounts . The price-disclosure initiative has become a cornerstone of the president \u2019 s 2020 re-election health strategy , despite threats of legal action from industry .\n\u201c Right now there is too much arbitrage in the system , \u201d a senior administration official said in an interview Thursday with The Wall Street Journal . \u201c There are a ton of vested interests who will oppose this . We expect to get sued . We \u2019 re really goring people \u2019 s oxes . \u201d\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How could information from insurers and hospitals be helpful to you if this plan goes into effect ? Join the conversation below .\nHospitals and insurers typically treat specific prices for medical services as closely held secrets , with contracts between the insurers and hospital systems generally bound by confidentiality agreements . Policy makers , employers and patients are often unable to see clearly which hospital systems and doctor practices are driving high costs .\nThe proposal covering insurers is the newest part of the price-disclosure initiative , and it would include the private-employer market , where about 158 million people get their health insurance . Insurers and group health plans would have to put the negotiated rates into a file that third-party developers could incorporate into shopping tools .\nInsurers would also have to create a web-based tool for beneficiaries that discloses the list price , the negotiated rate , cost sharing , and the amount left on a plan deductible , as well as allowable out-of-network rates , officials said . There will be a 60-day public comment period on the proposal .\nThe requirements for the negotiated rate file could cost insurers an estimated $ 200 million to build based on estimates in the proposal .\nOther costs include an estimated $ 64 million to $ 161 million for three years to implement and maintain posting about cost sharing .\nThe proposal also states that \u201c price transparency may have the opposite effect because in some markets where pricing is very transparent , pricing can narrow and average costs can increase . \u201d\nStudies show consumers are often required to pay more out of pocket when they don \u2019 t have the price information they need to comparison shop . Employer health-plan deductibles are outpacing wage growth and have risen to an average $ 1,655 for a single plan , according to a September survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation .

WSJ explains how the flow of money , drugs and rebates behind the scenes may drive up the price of prescription medicine for consumers .

First , they will have to provide insurer-specific negotiated rates in a computer-readable file .\nSecond , hospitals will have to post negotiated charges online for 300 specific services that patients typically shop around for . Seventy of those services , including vaginal birth , colonoscopy , and joint-replacement surgery , are stipulated in the rule , according to senior administration officials . Hospitals can select the other 230 services they post online .\nHospitals face fines of up to $ 300 a day if they don \u2019 t comply with sharing negotiated rates .\nThe requirements would cost hospitals more than $ 23 million annually in 2016 dollars , according to an estimate in the rule . Annual costs range from $ 38.7 million to $ 39.4 million in 2019 dollars .\nTaken together , the price-disclosure initiatives could reshape the $ 3.5 trillion health-care industry .\nPrices charged for health care vary widely depending on whether a provider is in or out of the patient \u2019 s insurance network and on the insurer \u2019 s undisclosed price agreements with hospitals .
