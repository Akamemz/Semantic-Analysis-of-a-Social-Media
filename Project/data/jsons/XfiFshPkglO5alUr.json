What initially appeared to be a mixed picture for Donald Trump and the Republicans has grown darker - but there is a Sunshine State silver lining .\nOn the morning after polling , Mr Trump said the results showed almost a `` complete victory '' .\nEven at the time that was difficult to square with the reality that his party had lost control of the House of Representatives for the first time in eight years .\nThere was the prospect that the Republicans were going to make historic gains in the Senate , however . The president boasted of the possibility of a four-seat pick-up - which would build the largest majority for his party in more than a century .\nHere 's a look at some of the most significant developments since the first round of election-night instant analyses , many of which were written when it was challenging to spot the Democratic wave among the evening 's early returns .\nIt became clear near midnight on election day that Democrats would take control of the House of Representatives . The only question was the size of their majority .\nMuch of that depended on the outcome of very close races and the slow trickle of results from California mail-in balloting . What could have been only a tenuous Democratic hold on power has slowly grown to a more robust advantage - and California is a big reason why .\nIn Orange County , the heavily populated suburbs south of Los Angeles , Republicans were routed . What used to be the backbone of conservatism in the state - the home of Richard Nixon , a place Ronald Reagan once referred to as `` Republican heaven '' - turned Democratic blue .\nFour Republican-held districts in the county fell , marking the first time since 1940 that all seven of its House seats will be represented by Democrats .\nAdd another two seats that have been called for the Democrats elsewhere in California and one that appears poised to go blue , and there could be only seven Republicans left in the state 's 53-seat congressional delegation . There 's still plenty of Republican red on the California map , but it 's all in the relatively unpopulated eastern portion of the state .

The scope of the rout , however , was remarkable .\nCombined with post-election-day victories for Democrats in New Jersey , Washington , Georgia and Maine ( and more on that in a minute ) , the Democratic House majority will have at least a 14-seat cushion with five races left to be decided .\nAlthough the size of the victory in terms of seats is dwarfed by the Republican waves of 2010 and 1994 , it is the largest Democratic House gain since the post-Watergate election of 1974 .\nIf the House results were good news for the Democrats , the Senate appeared to be another story .
