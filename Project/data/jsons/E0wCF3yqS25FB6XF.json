    "content": "The all-seeing social-justice eye penetrates every aspect of our lives : sports , movies , public monuments , social media , funerals . . .\nA definition of totalitarianism might be the saturation of every facet of daily life by political agendas and social-justice messaging .\nAt the present rate , America will soon resemble the dystopias of novels such as 1984 and Brave New World in which all aspects of life are warped by an all-encompassing ideology of coerced sameness . Or rather , the prevailing orthodoxy in America is the omnipresent attempt of an elite \u2014 exempt from the consequences of its own ideology thanks to its supposed superior virtue and intelligence \u2014 to mandate an equality of result .\nWe expect their 24/7 political messaging on cable-channel news networks , talk radio , or print and online media . And we concede that long ago an NPR , CNN , MSNBC , or New York Times ceased being journalistic entities as much as obsequious megaphones of the progressive itinerary .\nBut increasingly we can not escape anywhere the lidless gaze of our progressive lords , all-seeing , all-knowing from high up in their dark towers .\nThe Peter Strzok\u2013Lisa Page texts , along with the careers of former FBI director James Comey and his deputy Andrew McCabe , reveal a politicized and in some sense rotten FBI hierarchy , beholden far more to its own exalted sense of a progressive self than merely to investigating crimes against the people .\nLois Lerner was a clumsy reflection of how the IRS long ago became weaponized in service to auditing deplorables . Former CIA director John Brennan and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper used their supposedly nonpartisan positions to further political agendas . That each in his own way is clownish does not mitigate their rank efforts to graft intelligence agencies onto political causes .\nThe same deterioration is true of many in the Department of Justice , who , along with the FBI , misled FISA-court justices , as if that were the only , or perhaps the easiest , way to obtain politically driven surveillance on U.S. citizens . Americans now are woke to the reality that straying too much into the forbidden zone guarantees that their communications can be monitored on the pretense that they \u2019 re colluding with some nefarious power . Yet if foreigners are the menace , why did our proverbial best and brightest traffic with a paid foreign spy at election time to sabotage a political campaign , then trump even the improper use of electronic surveillance with the insertion of paid informants ?\nGoogle , Facebook , and Twitter are facing accusations of censoring social-media accounts and massaging Internet searches according to their progressive political agendas . The masters of the universe have given us the stereotype of 20- and 30-something social-warrior geeks , fiddling with their algorithms to virtue-signal their left-wing fides to a global audience .\nYouTube restricted more than 50 Prager University videos \u2014 often because either a human or computerized auditor did not approve of the videos \u2019 presentation of America \u2019 s historical role as beneficent . Tie-dyed T-shirts , flip-flops , and faded jeans do not mask the reality that some $ 3 trillion in global capitalization is pledged to ensure that the nations \u2019 computers , pads , and smartphones will not be polluted by traditionalist thinking .\nFirst-time congressional candidate Elizabeth Heng , a conservative from central California , found her video ad blocked on Facebook and Twitter . Apparently , her description of the Cambodian holocaust that her parents fled was too graphic or politically incorrect , or both . But then again , in California , everything is politicized , from plastic straws to single-user restrooms , in an Orwellian effort to distract us from the fact that we do not have enough water , usable roads , or workable public schools to remain a civilized state .\nLanguage is especially enlisted to disguise bothersome reality . During the Obama administration , no one would ever have known from \u201c overseas contingency operations , \u201d \u201c man-caused disasters , \u201d \u201c workplace disasters , \u201d and \u201c holy struggles \u201d that radical Islamic terrorists were seeking to kill Westerners from San Bernardino to Paris . As in the case of illegal aliens , undocumented aliens , illegal immigrants , undocumented immigrants , immigrants migrants , the progressive rationale is that anyone killed or harmed by a terrorist or migrant is usually a nobody and so an acceptable casualty in the greater war against incorrect speech and attitude .\nWhen our public colleges now find that an increasing number of newly admitted students can not do college-level work when they begin their courses , administrators drop the old idea of catch-up \u201c remedial \u201d classes or compensatory \u201c remediation \u201d courses . The new language conveys that students are now suddenly qualified , or at least it virtue-signals the university \u2019 s effort to be suitably sensitive to the fact that in California nearly half of those entering the CSU system can not read or compute at what previously had been thought to be a college level .\nOur very names and identities have become politicized . Desperate to highlight their progressive purity ( or to enhance careers ) , politicians sometimes reinvent their nomenclatures and ancestries to suggest solidarity with those deemed racially , ethnically , or economically oppressed . Who now is who or what ?\nSenator Elizabeth Warren claimed falsely \u2014 albeit not quite in the clumsy fashion of left-wing political activist and professor Ward Churchill \u2014 that she was part Native American .

I suppose \u201c Pat O \u2019 Lopez \u201d would be too shameless ? But then again , California Senate candidate Kevin de Le\u00f3n has added both a \u201c de \u201d and an accent to remind voters that he is not just an Anglicized Kevin Leon who could be mistaken for a third-generation Portuguese American .\nAmericans have long accepted that Hollywood movies no longer seek just to entertain or inform , but to indoctrinate audiences by pushing progressive agendas . That commandment also demands that America be portrayed negatively \u2014 or better yet simply written out of history . Take the new film First Man , about the first moon landing .
