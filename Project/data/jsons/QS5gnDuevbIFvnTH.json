    "content": "( CNN ) ISIS has metastasized into something many predicted , but most prayed would never happen : a nihilistic group of militants that has both a safe haven in an anarchic land and cells in Europe able to attack civilian targets .\nFrance , Russia and the coalition of Western countries now sound more bellicose than ever and have begun to act militarily .\nBut how simple is it to fashion a longer-term military plan ?\nHere are five inconvenient facts for those who believe there is a simple military solution to Syria\nISIS and the Syrian regime have few military opponents . Dozens of militias crowd the battlefield , their allegiances as impenetrable as they are varied . It 's a mess -- but a few players stand out , often for bad reasons .\nThe biggest Sunni Arab force against them is called Jaish al-Fateh . It 's an alliance that includes moderates , those who are increasingly radical ( such as Ahrar al Sham which , despite being termed `` radical '' by the U.S. State Department , nevertheless condemned the Paris attacks ) , and al Nusra Front , al Qaeda 's affiliate in Syria .\nThis alliance -- which had seen such great success against the Assad regime that it prompted many to think the Russian intervention was intended mostly to slow its advance -- has itself faltered .\nFor a while , Jaish al-Fateh stopped operations when one part of the alliance disagreed over its anti-ISIS stance .\nMeanwhile , the groups the West used to call `` moderates '' have been sidelined and underfunded and are tiny . The New Syria Force , which was the product of the Pentagon 's $ 500 million Train and Equip program , produced 54 fighters . Defections and clashes meant at one point the force only had five fighters left .\nThe other moderate force , the Syria Democratic Front , is also small and poorly supplied . Critics dismiss it as a fig-leaf group of Sunni Arabs to make the Kurdish forces they fight alongside seem more multiethnic .\nResult : There are n't many pro-U.S. forces in Syria right now . The Assad regime now has fighting alongside it Hezbollah , which the U.S. considers a terrorist organization , and the Iranian militia , which fought the U.S. in Iraq . Al Qaeda is the most militarily effective part of the main anti-Assad regime alliance . Then there 's ISIS . Many look to the Kurds as the best allies against ISIS , but ...\nThe Kurds are sometimes mistrusted by the main group the U.S. badly needs to court : Sunni Arabs . They , in both Iraq and Syria , are the ones whose disillusionment with the Alawi and Shia regime in Damascus and the Shia-dominated government in Baghdad gave ISIS the oxygen to exist .\nWhen the Assad regime bombed Sunni civilians at the beginning of the Syrian conflict , then continued daily for years , al Qaeda and then ISIS presented themselves as their protectors .\nSunnis are a minority in Iraq but a majority in Syria . Without their trust and cooperation , you ca n't expect to kick ISIS out . And the Sunnis do n't trust the Kurds . The Kurds in Syria have cooperated with the regime from the start -- or at least agreed not to fight each other .\nAnd the Kurds are most interested in creating their own homeland in northern Syria , which they call Rojava . That means that when they liberate lands from ISIS , it ca n't immediately be guaranteed that they will welcome back the Sunnis who used to live there .\nEven in Iraq it 's a problem : A Kurdish commander I met outside Sinjar last week said he felt all the Sunni Arabs around that area were ISIS supporters .\nThe upshot of this mistrust is an impediment for those who advocate using the Kurds as a ground force against ISIS . You ca n't expect to attack Raqqa , a Sunni Arab city , clear ISIS out and then be able to administer a large , angry Sunni population . Advocates of the Kurds say they can , and point to the fact that all the sides against ISIS are Syrians and have lived together in the past . But it will be a challenge .\nYou need Sunni Arabs -- and there are very few the U.S. wants to work alongside .\n3 . Turkey is part of the problem , even though it 's in NATO\nIt was the Turkish failure to stop jihadists flooding into Syria in 2013 that enabled ISIS to grow . The Turkish-Syrian border remains porous and the Turks are , many say , more interested in fighting the Kurds in Turkey , Iraq and Syria , whom they consider terrorists , than they are in combating ISIS .\nThis has changed since ISIS attacked Ankara , the Turkish capital , in October and has become all the more violent in southern Turkey .\nJUST WATCHED Hollande : Response to ISIS attacks must be pitiless Replay More Videos ...

This was an advantage that Washington badly needed in order to reduce flight times and increase sorties -- yet the holdup came even while negotiating with a NATO ally .\nUnless the border with northern Syria and Turkey is sealed , ISIS can continue to resupply its `` caliphate '' with new recruits and send attackers toward the West . Sealing that 900-kilometer ( 560-mile ) fence is an essential start -- but it has not happened yet .\n4 . Obama 's strategy sounds tired and compromised -- but it may be the best option\nAt the G20 meeting in Antalya , Turkey , this week , the commander in chief of the world 's most powerful military sounded a lot like he was justifying his policy of airstrikes and special forces advisers teaching local militia -- a policy that few thought was working .\nBut U.S. President Barack Obama 's challenge to people to present serious and effective alternatives was sound .\nAfter Iraq and Afghanistan , an indefinite military occupation of hostile territory is unlikely to sit well with the American public -- however viscerally satisfying an idea it sounds to politicians on the stump .\nAirstrikes and special operations forces strikes do eventually wear down insurgencies , as we saw in Afghanistan .
