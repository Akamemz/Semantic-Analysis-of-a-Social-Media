    "content": "Nobody \u2019 s perfect , or so Hannah Montana says . But I can \u2019 t be the only person who feels little enthusiasm for any US presidential candidate . I don \u2019 t even \u201c feel the Bern. \u201d Although this is the first election in which I can vote , I feel little incentive to do so . None of the candidates excite me or even intrigue me , and while I believe it is extremely important to exercise one \u2019 s right to vote , I wonder if I should really vote for a candidate I have no faith in . Here are the reasons why I find the front-running candidates ( Hillary Clinton , Bernie Sanders , Donald Trump , Ted Cruz , and Marco Rubio ) inadequate to be president . Maybe I \u2019 m too picky , but shouldn \u2019 t we hold our potential president to high standards ?\nI \u2019 m sure many young people reading this article are pulling their hair out and screaming , \u201c How can you NOT be a fan of Bernie ? \u201d Although I consider myself to be an Independent , I am more right-leaning than left-leaning , politically speaking . A candidate like Bernie or Hillary will never suit me , for several reasons that I could write another article on .\nOne of the main reasons that I will not vote for Bernie is because I simply believe his plans are too good to be true . Free college tuition , cheap healthcare , and substantially lower taxes for everyone except the rich sounds incredible . But , will Bernie \u2019 s plans even pass through Congress ? Most reports say the chances are slim to none , even with a democratic congress . Let \u2019 s play devil \u2019 s advocate and say that Bernie wins the presidency and congress approves his Christmas wish list . The extremely wealthy are taxed to pay for these services ( college tuition , healthcare , etc . ) for everyone else until , ultimately , the wealthy will not be wealthy anymore . The average Joe rejoices because he now has all this free stuff and his formerly rich neighbor , taxed into oblivion , no longer has his fancy Mercedes to flaunt .\nBut think about it : we will eventually run out of other people \u2019 s money . What happens when there are no wealthy people left ? Who will pay for all of these free services for everyone else ? Come on people , nothing is free . Sure , I \u2019 d love it if tuition was free so that students could begin their careers without being saddled with debt , and it would be great if healthcare costs decreased . But , we don \u2019 t always get what we wish for .\nIn addition , Bernie did not hold a steady job until he reached the age of 40 , when he was elected as mayor of Burlington , Vermont . Sure , he worked some odd jobs such as being a freelance writer and a filmmaker , but he did not really begin a career until the age of 40 . I want my president to be someone that worked hard for his or her entire life , had a steady career and a proven work ethic .\nFirst , there is the Benghazi scandal that not many people have not taken the time to research . I suggest reading the book Under Fire by Fred Burton and Samuel M. Katz . Educate yourself on what really happened in Benghazi and analyze Hillary \u2019 s reactions . The fact that Hillary stated that the attack on the US Diplomatic compound in Benghazi was caused by an anti-Islamic video is absolutely embarrassing . In addition , those in the Benghazi compound requested more security , but Hillary denied their requests .\nThe congressional committee held an investigation , which angered Democrats because they believed the issue was being politicized to damage Hillary \u2019 s upcoming presidential bid . During the congressional committee hearing , Ron Johnson , a Senator from Wisconsin , tried to get an answer from Hillary as to how and why the attacks occurred . Hillary responded , \u201c What difference at this point does it make ? \u201d This is a completely unacceptable answer from the Secretary of State . Imagine if I was giving a presentation in one of my courses in college , and at the end the professor asked me a question . What if my response to him was , \u201c I am done with my presentation . What difference at this point does it make ? \u201d My professor would probably be shocked , sum me up to be a poor student , and give me a bad grade . Hillary , on the other hand , is freaking Secretary of State and that is her response . Are we in elementary school ? Please , have educated answers when you hold such a high position of authority .\nAnd don \u2019 t even get me started on the email scandal . If Hillary can not keep emails separate and secure to ensure that our nation is safe then she is ineligible to be president . Is knowing how to use email accounts too much to ask for in a potential presidential candidate ?\nIf the democrats have made it this far to my article , I commend you . I \u2019 m sure the entire time you \u2019 re thinking , \u201c Surely Bernie and Hillary are better than any of the Republican presidential candidates ! \u201d Actually , the Republican presidential candidates are equally as bad .\nSome want to vote for Trump because they say he is an excellent businessman , but he has filed for bankruptcy four times . Some say that filing for bankruptcy can be a smart business move if your business is failing . But that \u2019 s the point : his businesses were failing . Perhaps most importantly , though , the US is not a business , it \u2019 s a country . Yes , we need a strong economy , but running a business and running a country are two entirely different things . Trump has not studied politics or international relations enough to understand what that entails .\nIn addition , Trump \u2019 s comment that all Muslims should be banned from the US after the Paris attacks also displays his lack of knowledge about international politics . Banning Muslims from the US will further marginalize them , which leads to more terrorist organizations , which leads to more attacks . Also , ISIS and other groups such as Assad \u2019 s regime in Syria are killing Muslims , and thus they are trying to escape their war-torn and extremely dangerous country by seeking asylum in the US . I understand the stigma surrounding immigration in the US as well as Europe . But do we want to look back on this situation in fifty years and feel shame because we turned back victims of sexual violence and torture ? If you lived in Syria right now , in fear of your life , would you want another country to provide you with aid ? Trump \u2019 s presidency is based on fear of \u2018 the other , \u2019 which doesn \u2019 t exist . We are all humans , and we need to treat each other as such .\nCruz has said that only the four states that were named in the Supreme Court \u2019 s decision on gay marriage should follow the ruling , but that other states should not follow the ruling . I just can \u2019 t believe that we are still arguing about gay marriage . This is another issue we will look back on in fifty years and be ashamed of . The Supreme Court ruled that gay marriage is legal in the US , so it is legal in the US .\nCruz has also said that he would consider carpet-bombing ISIS and wants to send arms to the Kurdish Peshmerga forces to help battle ISIS . Because sending arms to forces has worked before , and it hasn \u2019 t caused any terrorist groups to form or anything * screams internally * . Also , wasn \u2019 t good ol \u2019 Ted born in Canada ?\nRubio is also against gay marriage , which makes me hesitant to vote for him . I also do not agree with his views on climate change.Rubio claims that environmentally friendly standards and organizations are costly , and that the economy is much more important to Rubio than the environment . While I agree that we must strengthen our economy , being environmentally sustainable will lead us to be economically stable in the long run ( * cough OPEC cough * ) .\nRubio \u2019 s views on abortion are also concerning , mainly because they are unclear . I personally do not believe in abortion , except in the cases of rape , incest , and health of the mother . In the past , Rubio has stated that he has a zero-tolerance policy on abortion , but he has also co-sponsored legislation that allowed abortion in the cases of rape and incest . Rubio needs to choose a side and stick to it . Our president needs to have a clear idea of his beliefs and he must be able to follow through with those beliefs appropriately so that the American people are not mislead .\nThere are several issues that I have not discussed for all candidates ( such as gun control and term limits in Washington ) for the sake of length of the article . Perhaps I am being much too picky , but I believe that our president should be held to extremely high standards . We should expect honesty , clarity , respect , responsibility , and transparency from our president . Maybe the corruptness of Washington and the lobbyists have eliminated these values , and we will never have the government that the Founding Fathers envisioned . I love my country and I want to exercise my right to vote , but I am feeling disillusioned with our government and political system . I think we can do better , don \u2019 t you ?",
