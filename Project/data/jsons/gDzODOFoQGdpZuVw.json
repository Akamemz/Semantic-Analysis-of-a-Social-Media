They are Pennsylvania , Idaho , Arkansas , Kentucky , Oregon and Georgia .\nBut for our purposes , let us just examine the GOP Senate races being held tonight in the latter three .\nKentucky : Despite garnering national attention upon first launching his campaign , Tea Party candidate Matt Bevin \u2019 s hopes of unseating incumbent Sen. Mitch McConnell this evening look increasingly desperate . A recent Bluegrass poll shows Sen. McConnell leading by some 20 percentage points . Most political observers therefore acknowledge that McConnell will easily secure his party \u2019 s nomination yet again . But the campaign to keep his seat is only just beginning . Indeed , McConnell trails the Democrats ' hand-selected candidate , Alison Lundergam Grimes , by a percentage point ( according to that same Bluegrass poll linked above ) . Other polls confirm the race is a dead heat , too . So even if the Senate Minority Leader staves off a primary challenger tonight , he still has his work cut out for him .\nOregon : This is a race we \u2019 ve been following for some time . The establishment , pro-choice candidate , Dr. Monica Wehby , has been endorsed by Republican celebrity also-rans such as Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich . She \u2019 s also launched a series of successful campaign ads that seem to have really put her on the map . Her Republican Tea Party opponent Jason Conger , however , is hoping to capture the nomination tonight . But two separate polls show Wehby with a commanding , double-digit lead . Worse , another poll from earlier this month shows Wehby edging the incumbent Sen. Jeff Merkley ( D-OR ) by four percentage points ( 45/41 ) , with leaners .\nClearly , the establishment feels Wehby is the most electable candidate , despite some unflattering stories that have recently come out about her .\nGeorgia : This will be the most closely watched race of the evening . Seven candidates are hoping to succeed retiring incumbent Sen. Saxby Chambliss as Georgia \u2019 s next U.S . Senator . But only two will presumably advance to the next round . To wit , a candidate must exceed 50 percent of the vote to capture the nomination outright . And since there are tons of candidates vying for a nod , that \u2019 s unlikely to happen . Therefore , the top two finishers are expected to compete in a primary run-off on July 22 .\nWho might those top two finishers be ? At this stage polls indicate there are only three candidates who have a serious shot at the nomination . They are businessman and political novice David Perdue , Congressman Jack Kingston , and former Secretary of State Karen Handel . The latter candidate is probably most ideologically aligned with Tea Party conservatism ; she was endorsed by Sarah Palin and Red State 's Erick Erickson . Nevertheless , a recent Morris News Service/Fox5 poll shows that the race is very much up for grabs . Perdue currently leads his rivals with 27 percent of the vote but Kingston and Handel are essentially tied in second place at 17 percent . ( Nearly one-fifth of Republican primary voters in the state are also undecided ) . So if Handel finishes in the top two tonight , she could give the Tea Party a real fighting chance at the nomination and another primary victory . The winner is expected to take on Democrat Michelle Nunn in the general election .\nBe sure to stay tuned for our post-election analysis tonight after the results come in . Finally , another campaign season is fully underway .",
