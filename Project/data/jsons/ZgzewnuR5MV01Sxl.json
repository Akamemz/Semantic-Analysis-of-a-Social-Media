'' That 's all of them , not just the 690,000 who applied for temporary legal status under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) program that Trump will begin abolishing in March . Characterizing this as `` extremely generous , '' Miller demanded that Congress , in return , must\ncreate a $ 25 billion trust fund for a `` wall system '' that includes not just the Southern border but also parts of the North .\nappropriate additional funds to hire more Homeland Security personnel , immigration judges , and other staffers to crack down on the other 10 million or so undocumented immigrants .\nallow citizens to sponsor only their spouses and minor children while disbarring `` extended family '' such as adult children , parents , and siblings .

And all of that without increasing employer-based immigration , unskilled or skilled .

But President Trump 's designs for undocumented parents are not the only troubling aspect of this proposal . The proposed changes to family-based immigration are terrible too .\nNativists have popularized the notion that letting citizens and immigrants bring in anyone other than immediate family privileges connections over skills , which they say works to the economy 's disadvantage . But immigrants have always been coming to this country , establishing themselves , and then bringing in other family members . Trump himself would n't be in the country if his German grandfather , who spoke little English , had n't came to the United States at the age of 16 in 1885 to join his older sister . Indeed , thanks to decades-long backlogs in various family-based categories , there is less chain migration to the United States now than when Trump 's grandfather came . ( Only about a third of the relatives admitted under these categories currently are non-nuclear family members . ) Had the system worked then the way it works now , he might never have been admitted to America and his grandson would now be tormenting poor Angela Merkel for her refugee policies instead .\nChain migration worked to America 's advantage then , and it does so now . Only a third of the immigrants admitted under the family-based immigration system currently would even count as `` chain migrants '' \u2014and that 's by the nativists ' loose definition of the term . And those chain migrants do spectacularly well . A study by College of William and Mary 's Harriet Duleep and formerly of the National Science Foundation 's Mark Regets examined three decades of census data and found no difference in the final earnings of foreigners sponsored by family members versus those sponsored by employers . Though the former make less money than the latter initially , they make bigger income gains subsequently .\nWhy ? Because foreigners who come on family visas are n't tied to specific jobs or occupations . They are therefore far more open to acquiring new skills to go into fields where they expect the best returns . Also , since they do n't have jobs lined up when they arrive , they have a lower opportunity cost for starting businesses\u2014especially since they can count on family support . Finally , the `` best and brightest '' immigrants , who have many options , often pick America as their destination because they have family here .\nThe White House plan is a clever ploy to use the Dreamers as leverage to advance a nativist agenda .
