Apparently , the United States could possibly construct an embassy in the communist country in exchange for denuclearization of the Korean peninsula . This report comes weeks after sources said that the potbellied Dictator is also interested in bringing a McDonald 's to the famished nation as a sign of willingness to work with the west .\nAs noted by Swan 's sources , President Trump 's end goal is ultimately getting North Korea to give up its stash of nuclear weapons . If that includes establishing an official U.S. Embassy in the country , then President Trump could agree to that . His negotiating tactic is to be open to most possibilities that could reasonably get the two countries to a mutual agreement ( Via Axios ) :\n`` One of the sources , who is familiar with the president \u2019 s thinking , said Trump had made it a point not to reject any ideas headed into the summit : `` It \u2019 s definitely been discussed , '' the source said . `` His view is : 'We can discuss that : It 's on the table . Let \u2019 s see . ' Of course we would consider it . There \u2019 s almost nothing he 'll take off the table going in . ''\nThe source said North Korean officials have been wildly inconsistent in the pre-meetings , making it difficult to get any read on how the discussions might go . The source close to the White House added : `` POTUS will consider any idea anyone brings him if it delivers on denuclearization that is irreversible and verifiable . He wo n't be played by Kim . But it is not his style to \u2014 on the front end \u2014 rule out possibilities of what could happen or may happen depending on how negotiations go .
