Bernie Sanders ( I\u2013Vt . ) , for instance , say that `` Billionaires should not exist '' and the wealth disparity in America is `` a moral and economic outrage . '' California businessman Tom Steyer\u2014who happens to be a billionaire\u2014says that `` Senator Sanders is right , '' while Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D\u2013Mass . ) laments the `` extreme concentration of wealth '' in America .\nThey all call for both a wealth tax and a massive increase in government spending in order to fix this inequality and restore `` social justice '' in America . In doing so , they demonstrate how little they understand economics .\nFor starters , wealth inequality is a very poor measure of unfairness in our society . Speaking at the Peterson Institute recently , economist and former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers correctly made the case that a change in wealth inequality would have little impact on the concentration of political power .\nReducing inequality is also a poor means to fix whatever these candidates think ails America . In a 2013 paper published by the Brookings Institution , economist Scott Winship reviewed claims made about inequality and their negative impact on various aspects of our lives . In a summary of that paper for National Affairs , he writes that there 's `` little basis for thinking that inequality is at the root of our economic challenges , and therefore for believing that reducing inequality would meaningfully address our lagging growth , enable greater mobility , avert future financial crises , or secure America 's democratic institutions . ''\nA forthcoming paper by Cato Institute scholars Chris Edwards and Ryan Bourne confirms Winship 's and Summers ' findings . They also thoroughly debunk the claim that a more progressive welfare state is imperative to reduce wealth inequality .

As Bourne writes at Cato : `` Evidence from both here and abroad shows major social programs , not least Social Security , increase measured wealth inequality because they leave the non-rich with 'proportionately less to save , less \u2588\u2588\u2588 to save , and a larger share of their old-age resources in a nonbequeathable form than the lifetime rich .
