Welcome to Iowa , Kansas and North Carolina .\nAccording to the latest round of Fox News Senate battleground polls , none of the front-runners in those states hits the 50 percent mark . That means these races will be decided by late-deciding voters -- and campaigns competing furiously to get their voters to the polls .\nOne thing that is baked into the cake : President Obama is unpopular in these states . That will motivate Republican voters , yet there \u2019 s more to these races -- and with four days until Election Day , a lot could happen .\nLet \u2019 s start in Kansas , which has the most volatile Senate race .\nNo one was talking about Kansas when election season started . But everyone is now , as two long-time incumbents could get their walking papers Nov. 4 .\nThe new poll of Kansas likely voters finds independent Greg Orman has a one-point edge over Republican Sen. Pat Roberts : 44-43 percent . Three weeks ago , Roberts was up by five ( 44-39 percent ) .\nBoth candidates remain well below 50 percent , as Libertarian Randall Batson receives 3 percent , and another 9 percent is undecided or will vote for someone else .\nThe Democratic candidate , Chad Taylor , withdrew from the race Sept. 3 . Roberts was expected to win re-election until Taylor dropped out .\nStill , many more Kansans identify as Republican than as Democrat . So why isn \u2019 t Roberts ahead ?\nOrman has the edge not only because he captures the support of most Democrats , but also just over half of independents -- and more than a handful of Republicans to boot .\nEighty percent of Democrats back Orman . And nearly one in five Republicans go for him too ( 18 percent ) . Independents favor him by a margin of 51-26 percent .\nMeanwhile , the incumbent is having trouble consolidating the base : only 76 percent of Republicans support Roberts , who has represented Kansas in the Senate since 1997 .\nInterest in the election is up among Democrats : 66 percent were extremely or very interested earlier this month . That \u2019 s up to 74 percent now . Interest among Republicans held steady .\nEighty-nine percent of each candidate \u2019 s backers say they are certain to vote for their guy .\nOrman has so far refused to say which party he would caucus with should he win . Most of his backers -- 75 percent -- want Democrats to retain control of the U.S. Senate , while 12 percent want Republicans to win .\nAmong Roberts \u2019 supporters , a huge 93 percent want Republicans to take control .\nOverall , by 49-39 percent , Kansas likely voters want Republicans to win control of the Senate .\nRoberts has a 5-point edge among men ( 47-42 percent ) , while Orman has a 7-point lead among women ( 46-39 percent ) .\nObama \u2019 s job performance rating is underwater by 17 points in Kansas , the worst rating of the three battleground states tested . Some 39 percent approve , while a 56-percent majority disapproves .\nAmong those undecided about their vote in the Senate race , 36 percent approve of Obama , while 40 percent disapprove and the remaining 24 percent are unsure .\nThe small already-voted group goes for Orman by 51-36 percent .\nThe new poll also finds Gov . Sam Brownback could be in trouble . Democratic challenger Paul Davis comes out on top : 48-42 percent .\nEarlier this month , Brownback had a 6-point edge ( 46-40 ) , while in September Davis was up by 4 points ( 45-41 ) .\nBrownback is hurt by a lack of party loyalty , as just 73 percent of Republicans support him and 20 percent back Davis .\nAn 89-percent majority of Democrats are voting for Davis and independents back him by 53-27 percent .\nRepublican Joni Ernst is up just 45-44 percent over Democrat Bruce Braley in the race to replace Iowa \u2019 s retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin .\nBoth Ernst ( 94 percent ) and Braley supporters ( 95 percent ) have a high degree of vote certainty , and both candidates receive strong backing from their party faithful ( 89 percent and 90 percent respectively ) .\nThe reverse gender gap continues , as women are more likely to back Braley by 13 points , while more men support Ernst by 15 points .\nErnst is also helped by the fact that a 55-percent majority of Iowa likely voters disapproves of the job Obama is doing . Just 40 percent approve .\nIt \u2019 s a bad sign for Braley that undecided voters disapprove of Obama \u2019 s performance by a wide 25-point margin .\nIn addition , those who have already voted back Ernst by 61-31 percent .\nThere \u2019 s not much of a contest in the Iowa governor \u2019 s race , as incumbent Terry Branstad remains well ahead of his Democratic challenger Jack Hatch : 53 percent vs. 36 percent .\nBranstad \u2019 s lead comes from overwhelming support from Republicans ( 91 percent ) . Plus , he gets 13 percent of Democrats and 63 percent of independents .\nDemocratic Sen. Kay Hagan is up by just 43-42 percent over Republican challenger Thom Tillis among North Carolina likely voters . That \u2019 s down from a 5-point edge last month , when she was up 41-36 percent ( Sept. 14-16 ) .\nThe incumbent Democrat \u2019 s lead widens to 55-31 percent among the small subgroup of voters who have already cast their ballot .\nBy 47-39 percent , women back Hagan . In 2008 , when Hagan won the seat , she received 55 percent of the vote among women ( Fox News exit poll ) . By 46-39 percent , men go for Tillis .\nEighty-six percent of Democrats back Hagan , while 84 percent of Republicans support Tillis . In a tight race , those couple of points matters .\nIndependents split 36-36 percent . In September they backed Tillis by 12 points .\nWhite voters back Tillis by 51-34 percent . Black voters support Hagan by 84-3 percent .\nA special note to election junkies : North Carolina polls close at 7:30 p.m . ET on election night and will provide early clues about which party will control the U.S. Senate . If Hagan ultimately loses , it will be a bad harbinger for Democrats .\n`` If you think about the three Southern states in which Republicans are trying to knock off incumbent Democrats -- Arkansas , Louisiana and North Carolina -- Sen. Hagan is almost certainly the toughest 'out ' for the GOP , '' says Republican pollster Daron Shaw , who jointly conducts the Fox News poll with Democratic pollster Chris Anderson .\nMore voters think Hagan agrees with Obama too often ( 48 percent ) than think Tillis is too conservative on the issues ( 35 percent ) . In fact , they are more than twice as likely to say Tillis is not conservative enough ( 13 percent ) than that Hagan doesn \u2019 t agree with Obama often enough ( 5 percent ) .\nAt 42 percent approval , President Obama receives his best job rating in North Carolina of the states polled ( 54 percent disapprove ) .\nAmong Tillis supporters , 92 percent feel certain they will vote for him , while 88 percent of Hagan supporters say the same .\nSo , that \u2019 s enough about midterm elections . Let \u2019 s talk about the race everyone also wants to really talk about : 2016 !\nIn Iowa , the first hurdle to the White House , Democrats prefer Hillary Clinton . By a lot : 62 percent want her to be the nominee . She \u2019 s followed by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren at 14 and Vice President Joe Biden at 10 percent .\nFor the GOP nominee , Republican likely voters are spreading their support around . In the low double digits are former Arkansas Gov . Mike Huckabee ( 13 percent ) and author Ben Carson ( 12 percent ) . They are closely followed by Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan ( 9 percent ) , former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush ( 8 percent ) and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul ( 8 percent ) . Both New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz receive 7 percent , former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum comes in at 6 percent , and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker receive 5 percent .\nIn Ohio , a virtual must-win state in presidential elections , Clinton tops each of the Republican challengers tested .\nThe closest hypothetical matchup is between Clinton and Ohio Gov . John Kasich . She bests him by just 3 points among Ohio voters : 47-43 percent .\nClinton also tops Christie by 7 points , Paul by 9 points , and both Jeb Bush and Texas Gov . Rick Perry by 10 points .\nGov . Kasich is poised to win re-election easily , as the poll finds he leads Democratic challenger Edward FitzGerald by 15 points ( 51-36 percent ) .\nThe Fox News Poll is conducted under the joint direction of Anderson Robbins Research ( D ) and Shaw & Company Research ( R ) . The polls were conducted Oct. 28-30 , 2014 , by telephone ( landline and cell phone ) with live interviewers among a random sample of likely voters in Iowa ( 911 ) , Kansas ( 907 ) , North Carolina ( 909 ) and Ohio ( 803 ) . Results based on the full sample in each state have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points .",
