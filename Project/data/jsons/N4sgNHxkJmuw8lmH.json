    "content": "President Barack Obama wanted to show he was so serious about the threat posed by ISIL that he gave a speech from the Oval Office about it\u2014standing up .\nBut afterwards , America knows just about as much what he 's doing and what 's going on as it did before he scrambled Sunday 's prime time schedule with the ultimate presidential prop .\nFrom the spot where George W. Bush spoke the night of Sept. 11 , Richard Nixon resigned and John F. Kennedy talked civil rights and the Cuban Missile Crisis ( all seated , behind where he stood ) , Obama looked firmly into the camera and gave America a not-so-peppy pep talk .\nHis strategy in Syria : working , air strikes and coalition expansion underway .\nLaw enforcement officials : on the case , sharing intelligence and tracking people down .\nPeople had to look somewhere else for how he 's going to step up the mission against ISIL , his positions on several related pieces of legislation in Congress or how exactly he thinks that a 13-minute summoning of political theater is going to turn around two-and-a-half weeks of dismissing much of the response since the Paris attacks as overreaction and Republican fear-mongering .\n\u201c Is that all there is ? We need a new President - FAST ! \u201d Republican frontrunner Donald Trump tweeted as Obama finished .\nThough perhaps no response said more than Hillary Clinton \u2019 s , who didn \u2019 t issue any , by Twitter or press release , pro forma or detailed , leaving her comments to the anti-terrorism speech she delivered Sunday in Washington hours before Obama walked into the Oval Office .\nRepublican presidential candidates , led by Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz , used their weekend events and TV interviews to go into bloodthirsty overdrive : \u201c carpet bomb them into oblivion , \u201d Cruz said in Iowa on Saturday . Go after their families , Trump said Sunday morning in an interview on \u201c Face the Nation \u201d on CBS .\n`` What \u2019 s too far ? What \u2019 s too far ? '' Trump said . `` They are killing people . ''\n\u201c Destroy the caliphate , \u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-S.C. ) said Sunday morning on NBC \u2019 s \u201c Meet the Press . \u201d\nBy contrast , Obama tried to go bloodless , waiting as at other crucial moments of his presidency for comments like that to set the tone\u2014a new CNN/ORC poll shows people disapproving of Obama \u2019 s handling of ISIL 64-33 percent and his handling of terrorism 60-34 percent\u2014then built up a high-profile speech to respond , and said close to nothing .\nMeanwhile , a sense of panic has set in that \u2019 s less like last year \u2019 s sci-fi horror movie cable news frenzy over Ebola , more like a frightening new reality where everyone everywhere feels like they could be mowed down or blown up by someone shouting Allahu Akbar . A measure of how far things have tilted : that same CNN/ORC poll shows that 53 percent of people say they now want to send new ground troops in to fight ISIL .\nObama 's cool , calm `` I got this '' air helped get him elected in 2008 . Seven years later , it \u2019 s clear that many Americans don \u2019 t want reassurance , but want him to convey the sense of urgency that they \u2019 re feeling . Aides were hoping that he \u2019 d be able to .\nGiving the speech from the Oval Office \u201c conveys the seriousness with which we are taking the issue , \u201d a senior administration official said Sunday afternoon , ahead of Obama \u2019 s remarks . Americans would see Obama in \u201c a familiar and appropriate venue , \u201d the official said , \u201c from the place where he makes his decisions . \u201d\nBut he didn \u2019 t announce any of those decisions on Sunday . And the four minutes he spent during the Oval Office address explaining what he thinks Americans should do were shorter on details and passion than the four minutes he spent saying what he thinks Americans shouldn \u2019 t do .\n\u201c We can not turn against one another by letting this fight be defined as a war between America and Islam , \u201d Obama said . \u201c That , too , is what groups like ISIL want . \u201d\nThe irony is that , rhetoric aside , while Americans say they seriously disapprove of Obama \u2019 s performance on terrorism , few Republicans or Democrats have proposed anything substantively different from what Obama 's doing in Syria .\nThat \u2019 s not all : he \u2019 s been waiting since February for Congress to move on his updated Authorization of Military Force that he called for again Sunday . He acknowledged again on Sunday the uncomfortable truth that no solution or strategy can account for every angry or crazed person willing to die who connects with murderous ideology on the Internet or directly in their lives .
