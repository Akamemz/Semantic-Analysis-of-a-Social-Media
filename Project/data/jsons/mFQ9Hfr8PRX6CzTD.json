Economists estimate the national unemployment rate sits between 15 and 20 percent , much higher than it was during the Great Recession in 2008 and 2009 . The unemployment rate at the peak of the Great Depression was about 25 percent .\nThe new weekly jobless claims figure came in around economists \u2019 predictions , which were expected \u201c to be staggering , but not growing , which is a small mercy , \u201d said Julia Pollak , a labor economist at ZipRecruiter .
