As I mentioned at the time , interpreting elections seems to have become an American obsession . Our fixed-term elections mean that off-year contests serve as a referendum on national issues , and narratives allow the losers in a winner-take-all system to tell their side .\nBut there \u2019 s a danger for Trump opponents in overinterpreting Tuesday \u2019 s result . Elections also have concrete implications that deserve attention . And any analysis of off-year contests should involve careful thinking about the relationship between national and state/local politics .\nThinking back to the presidential election , we \u2019 ve obviously spent a lot of time parsing that unexpected outcome . There is , of course , no single reason why Trump won the presidency . But I think it \u2019 s useful to treat the reasons the election was competitive as structural , while the proximate causes of actual outcome were rooted in far more situational factors . These include the timing of the letter from then-FBI Director James Comey , and whatever forces in the universe tipped about 20,000 voters in a few key states . Structural factors include the pain of voters in the Rust Belt , where we \u2019 re told that economic anxiety and poor health outcomes and general resentment drove a new political movement . They also include the fundamentals that make it difficult for a party to win three White House terms in a row .\nIt would be a big mistake for hopeful Democrats to assume that Ralph Northam \u2019 s victory in the Virginia gubernatorial contest is the opposite . Attributing even a more robust margin like Northam \u2019 s to a deep and enduring shift in the values of the electorate is where serious mandate errors come from . In other words , voters are rarely eager to hand the president \u2019 s party more power at this point , and Trump \u2019 s unpopular agenda means they \u2019 re even less likely to do that at this point . But Tuesday \u2019 s numbers don \u2019 t mean we \u2019 re suddenly living in a different country than we were a year ago .\nThe bad news for everyone is that a national governing majority is still very elusive . Last year , Republicans won control of the federal government , but finding a popular governing agenda and enacting it is another matter . The pendulum swings of American electoral politics contribute to this problem ; midterm elections have typically been bad for the president \u2019 s party .\nMore recently , though , they are not just a correction or a bit of pushback . Congressional party control changes more frequently than it once did , and so the stakes are higher , giving politicians an incentive to avoid cooperation . Congressional elections have become more nationalized affairs . It \u2019 s great to get to weigh in on what the president is doing and remind the person in the White House that there \u2019 s an opposition . It \u2019 s less than ideal , to say the least , to be entangled in an ongoing contest for the soul of the nation , in which each side views the other as an existential threat .\nThe absence of a national governing majority \u2014 or the institutional tools to create one \u2014 is the main lesson of 2016 . You can win elections , but that doesn \u2019 t translate into a platform to move forward at the national level . While we saw majorities gather against Trump at the state and local level , we should remember that the national picture is still very murky .\nFor Democrats , the real victory of Tuesday \u2019 s elections was that the party can now boast a diverse slate of state and local officeholders in several areas of the country . That \u2019 s how you build a party . Ideally , American democracy would have two organizationally robust parties that reflect the diversity of the nation . We \u2019 re a long way off from that , but it \u2019 s in these concrete developments , not sweeping election interpretations , that we might find hope for American democracy .",
