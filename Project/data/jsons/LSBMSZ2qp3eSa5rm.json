Speaking to cheering supporters Tuesday night at Trump Tower , he declared : \u201c We don \u2019 t have much of a race anymore . \u201d\n\u201c [ Texas ] Senator [ Ted ] Cruz is just about mathematically eliminated , \u201d Trump claimed . \u201c We \u2019 re really , really rockin \u2019 . \u201d Indeed , Cruz 's poor showing left him with no mathematical chance of clinching the nomination before the Republican convention in July , though Trump could still end up short of the needed 1,237 needed to seal victory before the gathering .\nWith 94 percent of precincts reporting , Trump had garnered 60 percent of the vote , his highest total in any state . He had claimed at least 89 of New York 's 95 Republican delegates .\nOhio Gov . John Kasich finished second in the state with 25 percent of the vote , leaving Cruz to finish third with 15 percent . Kasich was awarded at least three delegates , leaving Cruz in danger of getting shut out .\nAs of Tuesday night , Trump had 845 delegates . Cruz had 559 , and Kasich had 147 .\nCruz , who infamously panned Trump 's `` New York values '' earlier in the primary , had been bracing for a tough showing in the Empire State and showed no signs of throwing in the towel .

Bernie Sanders in her adopted home state , which she represented in the Senate for eight years . Despite the Brooklyn-born Sanders \u2019 hard-fought attempt at an upset , the former secretary of state successfully staved off that possibility Tuesday night .
