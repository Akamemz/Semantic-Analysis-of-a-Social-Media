And this might be her least authentic gambit yet . Meet Hillary Clinton , post-partisan healer , or something . As you watch , keep in mind that she had ripped `` Republican propaganda '' less than 30 minutes earlier from the same stage :\nIf you think you 've heard this exact spiel before , you have . Barack Obama made this red/blue/United refrain famous at the 2004 Democratic National Convention , where his star was officially launched . And he 's been using the disingenuous `` I only want the best ideas , regardless of where they come from '' line throughout his presidency -- all while doggedly pursuing his agenda , while eschewing and demonizing dissenting voices . Hillary acts as a poor man 's Obama here , yearning for grand nonpartisan unity . To call it ludicrously unconvincing would be an understatement . This woman has been an intense partisan throughout her entire career . This woman blamed the fallout from her husband 's improprieties and subsequent cover-up on a `` vast right-wing conspiracy . '' This woman has attempted to pin her wholly self-inflicted email scandal on the Republicans . This woman listed the GOP , alongside Iran 's terrorist regime , as an `` enemy '' of which she 's proud at a presidential debate . This woman compared pro-life Americans , half the country , to ISIS and Al Qaeda . Let 's be the American team . You first , lady . In another campaign speech , she mocked Donald Trump 's vague job creation plan :\nA few problems : ( 1 ) Donald Trump can turn right around and ask how many jobs she has created in her entire life , which has been spent preparing for , and living out , a relentlessly political existence . Aside from chauffeurs , private jet pilots , and email server installers , not too many . Easy counterpunch for him . Love him or hate him , and even counting his business failures , he 's created many thousands of jobs over the years . ( 2 ) Her jobs `` plan '' is Bill Clinton . Saying that she 'll put her husband in charge of one of the two most important elements of her duties is an interesting move . Sure , Bill enjoys strong popularity , and presidency is seen as an economic success .

The Clintons ' party has shifted so hard to the left since the late 1990 's that they 've been forced to repudiate large swaths of his agenda , including welfare reform and free trade .
