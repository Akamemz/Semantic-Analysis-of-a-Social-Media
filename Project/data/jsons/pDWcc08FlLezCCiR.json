Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , making good on his word , brought an empty bill to the floor , permitting both sides to try to round up 60 votes to fill in the text . Inauspiciously , the first day was consumed by a disagreement on where to start . McConnell wanted to begin with a vote on banning sanctuary cities . Chuck Schumer , speaking for the Democrats , demanded the Senate start with President Trump \u2019 s proposal . The dispute was particularly confusing because neither starting point has a remote hope of passage . An argument over which idea to reject first is very Senate 2018 .\nBut it \u2019 s worth zooming out . The public conversation around the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) program has gotten confused , with everyone agreeing to pretend , for various self-interested reasons , that President Trump actually wants a DACA solution , and fast . Trump and the Republicans have adopted this posture because DREAMers are wildly popular \u2014 giving DREAMers legal status is about twice as popular as Trump himself . Meanwhile , Democrats have agreed to Trump \u2019 s framing of his position because they think it helps pressure Trump into a deal .\nNegotiations on DACA have begun . Republicans want to make a deal and Democrats say they want to make a deal . Wouldn \u2019 t it be great if we could finally , after so many years , solve the DACA puzzle . This will be our last chance , there will never be another opportunity ! March 5th . \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) February 13 , 2018\nThere is a deep strangeness to this rhetoric . Trump created a crisis for DREAMers \u2014 all this began when he unilaterally decided to end the DACA program \u2014 and then refused the obvious compromises that could have fixed it . Now he is threatening a veto of the likeliest bipartisan compromises in the Senate . He has taken 690,000 hostages and is now trumpeting the wonderful opportunity everyone has to pay his policy ransom in order to free them , and he is doing all of it while insisting he desperately wants to free them too .\nThe truth is , Trump doesn \u2019 t want a DACA solution . He is willing to accept a DACA solution in return for other things he wants \u2014 notably , heavy investments in border security and a large cut in legal immigration \u2014 but within the negotiations , a DACA fix is the thing Trump is treating as a concession on his part , not the thing he is trying to make happen . If it were the thing he was trying to make happen , it would have happened already .\nRight now , the fate of the DREAMers doesn \u2019 t depend mainly on Democrats . It depends on Republicans . If McConnell and Paul Ryan want a deal , they could have one in moments .

If there \u2019 s no deal , and the Trump administration begins deporting DREAMers over Democratic objections , his real position will become very clear , very quickly .\nIf the Senate passes a DREAMer deal , will the House vote on it ?\nWhich bring us back to Congress . My conversations with both Democratic and Republican staffers , both inside and outside of leadership , have ended in unanimous shrugs . No one knows what , if anything , can actually pass the Senate . And the difficulty of that question pales in comparison to the difficulty of what , if anything , can pass the House .

They \u2019 re in the minority in both the House and the Senate , and after passing last week \u2019 s spending deal , they no longer have the threat of shutting down the government .\nThis is something I got wrong in my initial reaction to the shutdown deal . In preserving the option to shut the government down in the future , I argued , there was no real loss for Democrats , as they hadn \u2019 t abandoned any of their leverage . What I didn \u2019 t appreciate immediately was how much the shutdown had spooked Senate Democrats \u2014 after shutting down the government , they realized they had no strategy for winning the shutdown , and they certainly had no strategy for forcing Trump to fold amid the kind of high-stakes cable news showdown he lives for . So while the shutdown deal held open the option of a future shutdown , in fact , that option had closed , because Senate Democrats had lost faith in it .
