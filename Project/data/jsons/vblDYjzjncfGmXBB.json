I just think he picked the wrong word , '' Candy Crowley said of Romney on CNN shortly after the debate ended .\nCrowley was referring to the tense exchange in the final half-hour of the debate , when Romney questioned whether Obama had called the attack an `` act of terror '' rather than `` spontaneous '' violence that grew out of a protest against an anti-Islam video .\nROMNEY : I think ( it 's ) interesting the president just said something which -- which is that on the day after the attack he went into the Rose Garden and said that this was an act of terror .\nROMNEY : You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack , it was an act of terror . It was not a spontaneous demonstration , is that what you 're saying ?\nROMNEY : I want to make sure we get that for the record because it took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror .\nCROWLEY : It -- it -- it -- he did in fact , sir ... call it an act of terror .\nObama , indicating he thought he had just gotten a boost from the moderator , then chimed in : `` Can you say that a little louder , Candy ?

Here's the exchange:\n\nROMNEY: I think (it's) interesting the president just said something which -- which is that on the day after the attack he went into the Rose Garden and said that this was an act of terror.\n\nOBAMA: That's what I said.\n\nROMNEY: You said in the Rose Garden the day after the attack, it was an act of terror.
