Obama , who spoke during a brief pause in D.C. from his vacation in Martha 's Vineyard , said thousands of civilians as well as the U.S. embassy compound in Baghdad could have been endangered if the dam broke .\nHe vowed to continue a `` long-term strategy '' to turn the tide against Islamic State ( also known as ISIS , or ISIL ) militants , while continuing to urge the incoming Iraqi government in Baghdad to form an `` inclusive '' system .\n`` ISIL poses a threat to all Iraqis and the entire region , '' Obama said . He reiterated that Iraq will `` have to ultimately provide for its national security '' but said the U.S. has a security interest in stopping a `` savage group '' from spreading .\nThe U.S. military provided heavy assistance during the operation to retake the dam .\nPentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said Monday night , `` Over the past 72 hours , at the request of the Iraqi government , the U.S. military used fighters , bombers , attack , and unmanned aircraft to conduct 35 strikes that eliminated ISIL positions in and around the Mosul Dam complex . In all , we destroyed over 90 targets including a range of vehicles , equipment , and fighting positions . ''\nObama 's comments came after both sides gave conflicting claims regarding who had control of the dam . After local forces claimed they had seized it , the Islamic State , which two weeks ago captured the Mosul Dam spanning the Tigris River just north of the city of Mosul , denied those claims .\nThe retaking of the dam , though , marks the first major victory for the Iraqi and Kurdish forces battling the Islamic militants since U.S. airstrikes began earlier this month .\nIt could significantly boost their morale as they try to free territory overrun by the Islamic State in a blitz this summer . Also , the dam and its broader complex hold great strategic value as they supply electricity and water to a large part of the country .\nThe dam 's seizure by Islamic State militants on Aug. 7 was part of a string of victories by the Sunni radical group as it looks to expand its hold in northern Iraq , driving back Kurdish forces , sending minority communities fleeing and unleashing a wave of violence over a territory straddling the Syria-Iraq border .\nAlarmed by the militants ' advance , the U.S. and Iraqi airstrikes pounded the area over the past two days .
