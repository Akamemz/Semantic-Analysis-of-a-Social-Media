While working for ABC News in the summer of 2008 , he was addressing an Asian American Journalists Association convention in Chicago , with his \u201c 20/20 \u201d colleague Juju Chang also on stage . He began commenting on her dress .\nAs New York magazine reported in a brief and little-noticed item , Bashir said that `` I \u2019 m happy to be in the midst of so many Asian babes. \u201d And , he added , \u201c I \u2019 m happy that the podium covers me from the waist down. \u201d He said a speech should be \u201c like a dress on a a beautiful woman \u2014 long enough to cover the important parts and short enough to keep your interest \u2014 like my colleague Juju \u2019 s. \u201d Some audience members booed , the magazine said .\nA little digging reveals that ABC quietly suspended Bashir after the incident . He wrote an apology to the Asian-American group , saying : \u201c Upon reflection , it was a tasteless remark that I now bitterly regret . I \u2026 hope that the continuing work of the organization will not be harmed or undermined by my moment of stupidity . \u201d\nAn ABC spokesman declined to comment on the episode involving Bashir , a former \u201c Nightline \u201d co-anchor .\nThere \u2019 s an obvious contrast between ABC \u2019 s swift move and MSNBC \u2019 s decision to let the controversy build for nearly three weeks after Bashir delivering a disgusting personal attack on Palin that brought him widespread condemnation . By declining to suspend Bashir or denounce his remarks , MSNBC reached the point where the only way to control the damage was to sever its relationship with the British journalist .\nBashir said in a statement yesterday that he decided to leave the network after meeting with Phil Griffin .\nBashir had already apologized for what he called \u201c offensive \u201d comments about the former Alaska governor , whom he also called an \u201c idiot \u201d and \u201c dunce. \u201d He told viewers in a scripted commentary last month that someone should defecate in Palin \u2019 s mouth . He was invoking an old slave punishment in response to a speech by Palin , a \u2588\u2588\u2588 contributor , comparing the national debt to slavery .\nBashir took off two weeks for what was billed as a vacation , and there was a marked contrast with MSNBC \u2019 s treatment of Alec Baldwin , who got the boot over an alleged anti-gay slur hurled at a photographer . In his statement , Bashir said :\n\u201c After making an on-air apology , I asked for permission to take some additional time out around the Thanksgiving holiday .\n\u201c Upon further reflection , and after meeting with the president of MSNBC , I have tendered my resignation . It is my sincere hope that all of my colleagues , at this special network , will be allowed to focus on the issues that matter without the distraction of myself or my ill-judged comments .\n\u201c I deeply regret what was said , will endeavor to work hard at making constructive contributions in the future and will always have a deep appreciation for our viewers \u2013 who are the smartest , most compassionate and discerning of all television audiences . \u201d\nIn his own statement , Griffin said : \u201c Martin Bashir resigned today , effective immediately . I understand his decision and I thank him for three great years with msnbc . Martin is a good man and respected colleague - we wish him only the best . \u201d\nI do n't like to see anyone lose his job . But this was mishandled from the start .\nBut this one is different . Rather than chastising the New Jersey governor , who has undergone lap-band surgery , Politico says he has a pound-for-pound advantage :\n\u201c A fat nominee could be exactly what a Republican Party needs to shed its image as out of touch with ordinary Americans .\n\u201c Think about it\u2014Romney lost in 2012 in large part because he was perceived as lacking empathy . Exit polls showed that Barack Obama beat Romney by 10 percentage points on the crucial question of which candidate \u2018 is more in touch with people like you. \u2019 \u2026\n\u201c Christie \u2019 s size would allow him to do something similar with overweight voters .\nAnd let \u2019 s face it : America definitely has a plus-size electorate . Almost 70 percent of us are overweight , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , including more than a third who , like Christie , are obese . \u201d\nI don \u2019 t think the notion that waistline-challenged voters can relate to Christie is crazy . But this feels like a lightweight piece designed to get attention . Which we just provided .\nYou can feel the chill from all the way across the Atlantic .\nFor all the challenges facing the American media\u2014including an administration that has conducted surveillance of journalists doing legitimate reporting\u2014the situation here pales compared to what \u2019 s unfolding in London .\nThe feisty British press has always been constrained by stricter libel laws and the lack of a First Amendment . But now there are newsroom searches and talk of prosecution for publishing newsworthy stories .\nThis threat to the fundamental rights of a free press stems from the Ed Snowden NSA leaks to Glenn Greenwald , who published his stories in the Guardian , as well as to Bart Gellman of the Washington Post .\nGuardian Editor Alan Rusbridger was hauled before Parliament on Tuesday , while a top official was making noises about who might wind up in jail .\nKeep in mind that we \u2019 re not talking here about protecting confidential sources , as Snowden outed himself .
