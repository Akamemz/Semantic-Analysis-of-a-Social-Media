    "content": "Barney Frank has a new autobiography out . He \u2019 s long been one of the nation \u2019 s most quotable politicians . And Washington lives in perpetual longing for intra-party conflict .\nSo why has a critical revelation from Frank \u2019 s book , one that implicates the most powerful Democrat in the nation , been entirely expunged from the record ? The media has thus far focused on Frank \u2019 s wrestling with being a closeted gay congressman , or his comment that Joe Biden \u201c can \u2019 t keep his mouth shut or his hands to himself. \u201d But nobody has focused on Frank \u2019 s allegation that Barack Obama refused to extract foreclosure relief from the nation \u2019 s largest banks , as a condition for their receipt of hundreds of billions of dollars in bailout money .\nThe anecdote comes on page 295 of `` Frank , '' a title that the former chair of the House Financial Services Committee holds true to throughout the book . The TARP legislation included specific instructions to use a section of the funds to prevent foreclosures . Without that language , TARP would not have passed ; Democratic lawmakers who helped defeat TARP on its first vote cited the foreclosure mitigation piece as key to their eventual reconsideration .\nTARP was doled out in two tranches of $ 350 billion each . The Bush administration , still in charge during TARP \u2019 s passage in October 2008 , used none of the first tranche on mortgage relief , nor did Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson use any leverage over firms receiving the money to persuade them to lower mortgage balances and prevent foreclosures . Frank made his anger clear over this ignoring of Congress \u2019 intentions at a hearing with Paulson that November . Paulson argued in his defense , \u201c the imminent threat of financial collapse required him to focus single-mindedly on the immediate survival of financial institutions , no matter how worthy other goals were . \u201d\nWhether or not you believe that sky-is-falling narrative , Frank kept pushing for action on foreclosures , which by the end of 2008 threatened one in 10 homes in America . With the first tranche of TARP funds running out by the end of the year , Frank writes , \u201c Paulson agreed to include homeowner relief in his upcoming request for a second tranche of TARP funding . But there was one condition : He would only do it if the President-elect asked him to . \u201d\nFrank goes on to explain that Obama rejected the request , saying \u201c we have only one president at a time. \u201d Frank writes , \u201c my frustrated response was that he had overstated the number of presidents currently on duty , \u201d which equally angered both the outgoing and incoming officeholders .\nObama \u2019 s unwillingness to take responsibility before holding full authority doesn \u2019 t match other decisions made at that time . We know from David Axelrod \u2019 s book that the Obama transition did urge the Bush administration to provide TARP loans to GM and Chrysler to keep them in business . So it was OK to help auto companies prior to Inauguration Day , just not homeowners .\nIn the end , the Obama transition wrote a letter promising to get to the foreclosure relief later , if Congress would only pass the second tranche of TARP funds . Congress fulfilled its obligation , and the Administration didn \u2019 t . The promised foreclosure mitigation efforts failed to help , and in many cases abjectly hurt homeowners .\nThis is not a new charge from Frank : he first leveled it in May 2012 in an interview with New York magazine . Nobody in the Obama Administration has ever denied the anecdote , but of course hardly anybody bothered to publicize it , save for a couple financial blogs . I suppose those reviewing `` Frank '' can offer an excuse about this being \u201c old news , \u201d but that claims suffers from the \u201c tree falling in the forest \u201d syndrome : if a revelation is made in public , and no journalist ever elevates it , did it make a sound ?\nThe political media \u2019 s allergy to policy is a clear culprit here . Jamie Kirchick \u2019 s blanket statement in his review of `` Frank '' that \u201c readers \u2019 eyes will glaze over \u201d at the recounting of the financial crisis is a typical attitude . But millions of people suffered needlessly for Wall Street \u2019 s sins ; they \u2019 d perhaps be interested in understanding why .\nThat \u2019 s the main reason why the significance of Obama \u2019 s decision can not be overstated . The fact that we waited six years to get some semblance of a decent economic recovery traces back directly to the failure to alleviate the foreclosure crisis . Here was a moment , right near the beginning , when both public money and leverage could have been employed to stop foreclosures . Instead of demanding homeowner help when financial institutions relied on massive government support , the Administration passed , instead prioritizing nursing banks back to health and then asking them to give homeowners a break , which the banks predictably declined .\nThere were no structural or legislative barriers to this proposition . One man , Barack Obama , could tell another man , Henry Paulson , to tighten the screws on banks to write down loans , and something would have happened . Would it have been successful ? Would it have saved tens or hundreds of billions in damage to homeowners ? Even trillions ? Or would Paulson and his predecessors found a way to wriggle out of the commitment again ? We know the alternative failed , so it \u2019 s tantalizing to think about this road not taken .\nThis still matters because , as City University of New York professor Alan White explained brilliantly over the weekend , the foreclosure crisis isn \u2019 t really over . Though 6 million homes have been lost to foreclosure since 2007 , another 1 million remain in the pipeline , many of them legacy loans originated during the housing bubble . If you properly compare the situation to a time before the widespread issuance of subprime mortgages , we \u2019 re still well above normal levels of foreclosure starts .\nIn addition , over one in six homes remain underwater , where the mortgage is bigger than the value of the home , a dangerous situation if we hit another economic downturn . And up to 4 million homes face interest rate resets from temporary modifications , along with nontraditional mortgages where the rate is scheduled to go up . Home equity lines of credit are also nearing their 10-year limits , requiring borrowers to pay down principal balances . Some Americans have been waiting over five years in foreclosure limbo , which sounds great ( no payments ! ) until you understand the stress and anxiety associated with not knowing if you will get thrown out on the street at any time , something highly correlated with sickness and even suicides .\nIn baseball terms , we \u2019 re in the seventh or eighth inning of the crisis . And Barney Frank detailed how the president-elect had the opportunity to call the game and fix the problem much earlier , which he turned down . You \u2019 d think someone would have noticed .",
