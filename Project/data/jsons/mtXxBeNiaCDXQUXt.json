( Rebecca Cook/Reuters )\nWhen I hear people say that they don \u2019 t like dogma , what I hear is that they don \u2019 t like the dogma of people who disagree with them .\nDear Reader ( Including those of you not cursed to endure the sweatpant-fog climate of Washington , D.C. ) ,\nSometimes we use certain words only to describe the forms of that word we do not like .\nLet me explain : Let \u2019 s imagine that my daughter says , \u201c French food is awful . \u201d\nTo which I retort , \u201c Oh , I agree . We never should have let them talk us out of those toasted cheese sandwiches , that time . But you love duck confit and croissants . That \u2019 s French food , too . \u201d\nThe same dynamic plays itself out in many political and policy debates .\nMy go-to example of this is the word \u201c censorship. \u201d Over my many years of debating with intense libertarians of the left and the right , I \u2019 ve heard many times that \u201c all censorship is wrong \u201d or \u201c I am 100 percent against censorship . \u201d\n\u201c Oh really ? \u201d I ask . \u201c So riddle me this : The FCC prohibits hardcore child pornography on Saturday-morning TV . Are you against that ? \u201d\nThe answers tend to vary , but one very common retort is something like , \u201c Oh come on . That \u2019 s not censorship ; that just reasonable regulation . Besides , no one is proposing doing that . \u201d\nTo which I reply \u2014 and I \u2019 m going to stop using quotation marks because this is getting silly \u2014 of course it \u2019 s censorship . You just approve of it , so you don \u2019 t call it censorship . As for the fact that nobody is proposing running kiddie porn in the cartoon hour doesn \u2019 t mean much . If someone did propose it , you \u2019 ve conceded that it would be reasonable to proscribe it . Ergo ( an incredibly douchey word to use in debate over beers , by the way ) you \u2019 ve conceded that you \u2019 re not 100 percent against censorship . Censorship , in other words , is the word we use for censorship we don \u2019 t like .\nNow , I \u2019 m being unfair to people who have better or more interesting responses to my case , but that \u2019 s okay because a ) that \u2019 s very rare and b ) I \u2019 m not here to discuss censorship .\nThere are all sorts of words that work this way in our politics . Every day I hear people say that one shouldn \u2019 t be \u201c dogmatic , \u201d or that their political opponents are dogmatists , or some such . But as I have written many times , everyone subscribes to all manner of dogmatic convictions \u2014 and they should . People not dogmatically opposed to genocide , premeditated murder , rape , etc . aren \u2019 t brave and pragmatic free-thinkers . They \u2019 re sociopaths .\nThe accumulation of dogma \u2014 good dogma , duck-confit dogma , not-snail dogma \u2014 is the process by which civilizations advance . In a state of nature , man is open to all possibilities if he can be convinced he will gain an advantage in a bid to survive . With no controlling moral authority beyond the basic programming of our genes , we were free to take the shortest route between any two points , so long as we believed it would work out well for us . Even after the Agricultural Revolution , civilizations defined morality largely according to what benefitted the rulers . Child sacrifice \u2014 common around the globe for millennia \u2014 seemed like a plausible way to get better crop yields , so why not go for it ?\nOver time , through the process of trial and error informed by reason and faith , we accumulated some conclusions about how society should operate . These conclusions became dogmas . Dogma is simply the word we use for settled questions we no longer want to reopen . Not all dogmas are good . Some are evil , to be sure : child sacrifice , slavery , etc . But the process of refining our dogmas is what makes us , if not human , then certainly humane . Conversely , the process by which we unthinkingly smash dogmas without understanding their function is the fastest route to barbarism . The Bolsheviks rejected the dogma of universal human dignity and slaughtered people with an abandon more closely resembling the Aztecs than anything resembling secular humanism .\nWhen [ man ] drops one doctrine after another in a refined skepticism , when he declines to tie himself to a system , when he says that he has outgrown definitions , when he says that he disbelieves in finality , when , in his own imagination , he sits as God , holding no form of creed but contemplating all , then he is by that very process sinking slowly backwards into the vagueness of the vagrant animals and the unconsciousness of the grass . Trees have no dogmas . Turnips are singularly broad-minded .\nWhen I was flying over the North Slope of Alaska with a bush pilot nearly 20 years ago , the pilot told me how he once discovered a field of dead moose , almost entirely intact , save for the fact that they had their bellies ripped open . He explained that a grizzly bear or bears had killed all the females just to eat the unborn calves out of their bellies \u2014 because that was the tastiest part . Rather than eat just one whole moose , the bear was simply guided by the turnip-like dogma of its instincts . The history of humanity is full of stories where people , likewise , lived with such undogmatic cruelty . Of course , it \u2019 s unfair to describe the bears as cruel , because they have no concept of cruelty . They think it is good to eat your face , because that is their nature . We do have a concept of cruelty , and we have dogma to thank for it .\nSo when I hear people say that they don \u2019 t like dogma , what I hear is that they don \u2019 t like the dogma of people who disagree with them .\nIn the last 48 hours , amidst the flop-sweat panic over Anthony Kennedy \u2019 s retirement , I \u2019 ve heard one abortion activist after another \u2014 including many who play objective journalists on TV \u2014 insist that abortion opponents are crazed ideologues who want to impose their ideology on others . I have no doubt that these talking points test very well in focus groups . I also have no doubt that these talking points are sincerely held .\nLast night , I saw a tweet from the president of NARAL and responded to it :\nAll positions on abortion are ideological . https : //t.co/geE1H0Z12V \u2014 Jonah Goldberg ( @ JonahNRO ) June 29 , 2018\nIdeology is the first draft of dogma . The good kind is merely a set of preferences , grounded in conviction , evidence , experience , or reason , that helps guide us when we think through an idea or when we encounter new problems or facts . Progressives have an ideology . Conservatives have an ideology . Libertarians , socialists , and , yes , pragmatists have ideologies , too .\nPart of my ideology is the idea that we should err on the side of protecting individual liberty . I am not categorically opposed to restrictions on individual liberty , however . I favor a military draft when it \u2019 s necessary ( and I am ideologically opposed to one when it is unnecessary ) . I believe in putting rapists in jail and executing the most heinous murderers . But part of my ideology holds that we should only do so after providing due process . My concern isn \u2019 t that we might be unfair to a rapist or murderer , however . My concern is that without such systems in place , there \u2019 s too much potential to be unfair to someone falsely accused of murder or rape . The mob hates due process .\nThe debate over abortion revolves around a question of fact \u2014 or interpretation of fact \u2014 that then determines the ideological course of action like the first choice in a \u201c choose your own adventure \u201d book . If you conclude that the unborn , either at conception or at some later point of the pregnancy , acquires moral status and rights , you go down one path of thought . If you believe , like Barbara Boxer does , that it \u2019 s not really a baby until you bring it home from the hospital , that sets you down another path .\nBoth sides in this dispute share some dogmatic and ideological convictions . They just apply them differently . The hardcore pro-abortion crowd uses the language of individual liberty about the mother : How dare the state tell me what to do with my body ! ? In order to make this argument , however , they must define away that other life as nothing more than uterine contents , a glob of cells , or some other euphemism . The hardcore anti-abortion crowd starts from the premise that the fetus is an individual human being and as such deserves protection from harm . And it is the state \u2019 s first obligation to police or regulate violence .\nBoth of these positions are ideological . One common response to this claim , peppering the replies to my tweet , is that abortion isn \u2019 t ideological for the pregnant woman . There \u2019 s some truth to this , in the sense that we often shed our abstract commitments when pressed with real-life choices or difficult circumstances . That \u2019 s why we have the saying , \u201c There are no atheists in fox holes . \u201d\nThe progressive who pounds the table in defense of public schools but sends his own kids to a private school is one example . The conservative CEO who talks a great game about the free market and the evils of crony capitalism but barely hesitates to accept a subsidy is another . This hypocrisy is entirely human , and our capacity to rationalize such things is often infinite .\nAnd one of the most common ways we grease the skids for our retreat is by simply switching one ready-made ideology for another .\nBad ideology , like bad dogma , is a very real thing as well . Bad ideologies confuse is and ought . They hitch themselves to an unproven or unfalsifiable conviction about the way things should be . The worst ideologies assume humans are clay , dispensable when insufficiently pliable . They heap scorn on the hard-learned lessons of civilization in favor of glorious castles built in the air . Opposition to their agenda is seen as an evil desire to deprive people of happiness not attainable in this life .\nOther ideologies are just silly \u2014 not in the desirability of their aims necessarily , but in the belief that they would work . Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won her congressional primary contest in New York this week by championing one such ideology . It basically boils down to what someone called \u201c open-borders socialism. \u201d It is grounded in an ancient romantic notion that economics \u2014 the science of competing choices amidst finite resources \u2014 is a con . We can do all the good things simultaneously . Everyone can become an American , and every American is entitled to free housing , free school , guaranteed work , and every other good thing . It is the ideology of the child or the aristocrat \u2014 often the same thing \u2014 that holds we can of course have our cakes and eat them too . And as with the more evil forms of ideology , its advocates assume that those opposed are motivated by a desire to deprive the deserving of something they could easily give them .\nIn a world of infinite resources , it would indeed be a crime to deprive others of their fair share of the infinite . But we don \u2019 t live in that world . Part of the job of parents is to explain to children that \u201c We are not made of money \u201d and even if we were , we could not or would not satisfy our children \u2019 s every whim .\nBut we live in a time of epidemic childishness , working on the assumptions that we can borrow money forever and that the government is made of money . \u201c Example is the school of mankind , and he will learn at no other , \u201d says Edmund Burke . What he meant by that is people must learn from actual events : They must be shown , not told . This doesn \u2019 t mean that every generation must relearn first-hand the mistakes of the past . It means they must be taught about the mistakes of the past . That \u2019 s what parents do with their kids . And it \u2019 s what grown-ups do in politics .\nBut there \u2019 s a marked shortage of grown-ups these days , which is a real calamity when childishness runs free .\nI know the G-File has been lacking of late in the jocularity some folks look for in this \u201c news \u201d letter . My apologies .

I \u2019 m going to the beach next week , so hopefully I will come back refreshed with a full tank of pull-my-finger jokes .\nCanine Update : A few months ago , Megan McArdle and I briefly discussed dog economics on the Remnant podcast .
