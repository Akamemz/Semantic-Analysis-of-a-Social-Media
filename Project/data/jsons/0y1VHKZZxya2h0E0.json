Martin Luther King Jr .\nBut they resulted in a rarely invoked Senate rule being used to formally silence Sen. Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass .\nOn the Senate floor Tuesday night , Warren read aloud from a letter Scott King wrote in 1986 , when King objected to President Reagan 's ultimately unsuccessful nomination of then-U.S. Attorney Jeff Sessions to a federal district court seat .\nSessions , now a Republican senator from Alabama , is President Trump 's nominee for U.S. attorney general .

''\nThat objection came nearly 30 minutes after Warren was initially warned about impugning Sessions by Sen. Steve Daines , R-Mont. , who was presiding over the Senate at the time .\nRapping on the presiding officer 's desk , Daines had initially cut Warren off some 20 minutes into her speech .\n`` The senator is reminded that it is a violation of Rule 19 of the standing rules of the Senate to impute to another senator or senators any conduct or motive unworthy or becoming [ sic ] a senator , '' Daines said , apparently reading from a note on his desk .\n`` Mr. president , I do n't think I quite understand , '' Warren replied . `` I 'm reading a letter from Coretta Scott King to the Judiciary Committee from 1986 that was admitted into the record . I 'm simply reading what she wrote about what the nomination of Jeff Sessions to be a federal court judge meant , and what it would mean in history for her . ''\nDaines said his interruption was a `` reminder '' that did n't necessarily apply to what Warren had just said . `` However , '' he continued , `` you stated that a sitting senator is a disgrace to the Department of Justice .

'' He added , `` Form of voice includes quotes , articles , or other materials . ''\nWarren replied , `` So , quoting Sen.

As Warren began to speak , he added , `` And the senator is warned . ''\nThat formal warning set up the later interruption \u2014 and the forced termination of Warren 's remarks .\nWarren sought another clarification , as to whether she is allowed to `` accurately describe public views '' and statements about Sessions .\nAgain taking cues from the same staff member whose words he repeated , Daines replied , `` The chair has not made a ruling as respect to the senator 's comments .
