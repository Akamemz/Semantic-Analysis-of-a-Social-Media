A special phone line for instant and direct communication . These are some of the tools former Democratic leader Tom Daschle and former Republican leader Trent Lott used to forge bipartisan consensus and compromise when they ran the Senate a little more than a decade ago .\nIn a joint interview in the shadow of the Capitol , Daschle and Lott reminisced about bridging partisan differences to get things done -- instructive for today 's leaders talking past each other as the fiscal cliff approaches .\n`` We both decided that there were going to be times when we really needed to call each other immediately and not go through staff . And it was so urgent that when that phone rang , we knew we had a matter that had to be addressed right away . So we installed these phones and used them occasionally , and I never got a busy signal when I called , '' said Daschle , breaking out in laughter .\nLott recalled , `` Sometimes I would get up from my desk and I would go down the hall and I would come in the back door of Tom 's office and we would talk . And he would come down to my office . I mean , it 's a little thing , but sometimes if the leader says , ' I do n't want to do that , it looks like I 'm conceding to him .

There 's an argument that you do n't want to make it too early because that gives people that may not be too happy with it more time to undermine it , '' Lott said .\nDaschle added he believes it was easier to form consensus during their tenure because there were so many times of crisis : the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton , the attacks of 9/11 , the anthrax attack on Daschle 's office .\n`` Anytime there 's a crisis of that magnitude , it does bring people together a little bit easier , to bring caucuses and individuals , and provide some direction in ways that we do n't really have today , '' Daschle said .\nBut is n't falling off the fiscal cliff and possibly into another recession a crisis ?\n`` It could be , but we 're not there yet , '' Lott said .\n`` I do think they 've reached a point where they need to quit talking to each other through the media and talking about whole parties and the president and the leaders of Congress . Some of our most effective results came when we sat down at a conference table with -- sometimes with the president or at least with the chief of staff or his ( Office of Management and Budget ) director , with our key budget people , and we really talked about alternatives and hammered it out , '' Lott continued .\nDaschle added : `` There has to be lines of communication . You have the institution that creates mechanisms by which people can talk . One of the things that we did that I really regret that we did n't do more often was the whole joint caucuses , where members could talk among themselves without the cameras and without the public scrutiny , where you really could be candid .
