VA moves Sanders to center stage\nHe \u2019 s a combative , self-described \u201c democratic socialist \u201d more prone to hand-to-hand combat with Republicans than cutting deals with them .\nBut Bernie Sanders now is tasked with leading Democrats through a sensitive political dilemma that \u2019 s putting their party on the defensive .\nWith Eric Shinseki out at the Department of Veterans Affairs , the focus now shifts to Capitol Hill , placing the two-term Vermont independent and Senate Veterans \u2019 Affairs Committee chairman at the center of the growing VA health care controversy . Sanders , who caucuses with Democrats , is assembling a legislative package to help address the issue in the hopes that he can consolidate support within the veterans community and assuage concerns of vulnerable Democrats .\nIn the process , he \u2019 ll have to win over enough Republicans to push the bill through the narrowly divided Senate \u2014 or maneuver deftly so it appears that Democrats aren \u2019 t blamed for its failure .\nIt \u2019 s a tall task for anyone in a gridlocked Congress \u2014 let alone a fiery partisan in the middle of an intense election year . And he \u2019 s already engaged in a fierce back-and-forth with Republicans on the issue , after the GOP rejected his $ 21 billion vets bill earlier this year and he blocked a House plan aimed at holding senior VA officials more accountable .\nIn an interview Friday , the 72-year-old Sanders signaled his VA bill would move in the direction sought by Democrats : Expand access to health care within the VA system even as the GOP pushes to instead let veterans see private doctors .\nThe bill Sanders is developing would allow veterans waiting for care to access other federally licensed health centers or seek private care funded by the VA . The bill also proposes paying down student debt for nurses and doctors in order to bring medical professionals to the sprawling veterans health care system . And Sanders said that he will also aim to loosen strict deadlines for providing care within two weeks to vets , arguing that such onerous requirements contributed to the falsification of wait times .\nTo help head off GOP criticism after blocking the House bill aimed at making it easier to fire or demote senior-level VA officials , Sanders said he wants to strike a compromise with Republicans to hold bad actors accountable .\n\u201c I have concerns with what passed in the House because I worry about potential litigation and I worry about the politicization of the VA , \u201d Sanders said as he crisscrossed Vermont , speaking with veterans along the way . \u201c It \u2019 s a bad idea . I want to work on a compromise . \u201d\nRep. Jeff Miller ( R-Fla. ) , who chairs the House Veterans Affairs \u2019 Committee , said Friday he was \u201c very disappointed \u201d in Sanders \u2019 position , given that the House passed the accountability bill by a resounding 390-33 vote in May .\n\u201c We have to get accountability into the system , and it has to be real accountability , \u201d Miller said . \u201c Just like a member of Congress can fire their staff , so should the secretary have the ability to fire his senior level staff for not doing their job , especially for lying to them . \u201d\nStill , after President Barack Obama accepted Shinseki \u2019 s resignation Friday , Democrats hope the narrative over the scandal will shift away from the battle over whether there should be a new head of the VA \u2014 and instead focus mainly on which party has the best ideas for providing care to veterans . And Democrats believe they got a political boost when Sen. Richard Burr ( R-N.C. ) , the ranking member of the Veterans \u2019 Affairs Committee , engaged in a bitter tit-for-tat last week with some of the nation \u2019 s largest veterans groups over what he argued was their interest in \u201c defending the status quo within \u201d the VA .\nBut Democrats know they are not out of the woods yet , with growing GOP calls for more heads to roll .\n\u201c First , we have to come up with accountability : Who did what wrong , who should lead the veterans administration , where is the accountability ? \u201d Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) said in an interview . \u201c Second , we can \u2019 t leave it at that ; we have to get it well . Are veterans getting adequate health care ? \u201d\nSchumer added : \u201c To fire a whole lot of people , that may not make health care system work any better . And we have to work at that as well . \u201d\nOn Sunday , Sanders laid out the guts of Senate Democrats \u2019 proposal : Establish 27 new VA health care facilities in 18 states , upgrade the organization \u2019 s aging scheduling system , incentivize the hiring of more doctors and nurses and require Obama to create a national commission on veterans \u2019 access to health care . His committee will convene on Thursday to begin considering the legislation .\nThat the gruff Sanders is now in the middle of navigating through a political logjam for red-state Democrats seems rather unlikely . Since joining the Senate in 2007 , the former 16-year House veteran has established himself at the far left of the Democratic Caucus , as an aggressive voice calling for greater social welfare programs , a larger government role in health care and the elimination of tax breaks for corporations and the rich . His nearly nine-hour floor speech in 2010 \u2014 dubbed a \u201c filibernie \u201d \u2014 railing on Obama \u2019 s bipartisan tax deal made him a hero of the left . And he \u2019 s even openly toyed with the idea of running for president in 2016 as an independent .\nBut in recent days , Sanders has moved from being a fringe player in the caucus to a central player on a crucial issue dominating the national debate . He \u2019 s been on the phone with Obama and White House chief of staff Denis McDonough about how to move legislation forward in this tricky political climate .\n\u201c We \u2019 re going to take a lot of guidance from him on how to improve the system , \u201d Schumer said .\nPart of Sanders \u2019 challenge will also be navigating a divide in his own caucus . As senators return to Washington this week , Democrats will have to concoct a plan to hold more officials accountable , just as Republicans ratchet up pressure to pass a House bill that makes it easier to fire senior VA executives caught up in the falsification of records and the delay of health care .\nSanders , who says he still has concerns with that bill , is worried that it would eviscerate officials \u2019 due process and potentially lead to mass firings whenever the White House changes hands .\nBut a number of Democrats up for reelection this year were concerned enough about the scandal \u2019 s fallout \u2014 in the wake of a scathing inspector general \u2019 s report last week \u2014 that they quickly signed on to the House bill last week . Mark Warner of Virginia , Mark Pryor of Arkansas , Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana became co-sponsors of the Senate \u2019 s version of the House bill , sponsored by Republican Marco Rubio of Florida .
