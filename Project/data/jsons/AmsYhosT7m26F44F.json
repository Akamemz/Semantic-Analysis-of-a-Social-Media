And they are pushing Trump hard to right the ship -- namely by focusing exclusively on Hillary Clinton and seizing on her vulnerabilities -- to help avoid an electoral bloodbath in the fall .\n`` If it 's 10 points or more , we are in big trouble , '' said one top Republican , who asked not to be named to talk candidly about the Senate landscape .\nRepublicans believe there 's still ample time to fix their problems , particularly given Clinton 's high negative ratings in many polls . And they are confident in the strength of their Senate GOP incumbents , many of whom are well-funded and have built robust field operations that could help them outperform Trump in their states .\nBut in an interview at the Republican National Convention last month , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said flatly , `` I do n't think we know yet '' whether Trump will help or hurt Republicans down-ticket . He said each of the races are `` big , well-funded , individual pictures '' not necessarily tied to Trump .\n`` I think we 'll have to see where the presidential election ends up , '' McConnell told CNN . `` One of the good things about the Senate is the races are big enough to stand on their own . ''\nAsked if Republicans would keep control of the Senate , McConnell added confidently : `` We will . ''\nBut Senate Republicans also need help from Trump -- namely ensuring he remains competitive until Election Day .\nIn a private meeting this week at a Phoenix airport , Sen. John McCain of Arizona urged Trump 's running mate , Mike Pence , to keep the top of the ticket trained on Clinton -- and not engage in squabbles with other Republicans or distractions like his recent feud with Muslim-American parents whose son was killing while serving in the Iraq War , according to a source familiar with the session . Pence , the source said , agreed .\nFor Democrats to regain the Senate , they need to pick up four seats if Clinton wins the White House and five if Trump pulls off a victory . And there are ample opportunities for Democrats in blue and swing states -- namely in Pennsylvania , Illinois , Wisconsin , Ohio and New Hampshire .\nOther seats on the radar are the ones held by McCain in Arizona , Marco Rubio in Florida and Indiana 's Dan Coats , who is vacating his seat .\nDemocrats are defending just one seat that Republicans stand a serious shot of winning at the moment -- Nevada -- being vacated by Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid . Republicans once were hopeful they had a shot in Colorado , but GOP recruiting failures led to the nomination of conservative Darryl Glenn , who is trailing Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet by double digits in recent polls .\nWith Trump 's standing dropping markedly since the convention , the Democratic strategy is simple : Tie every Republican to their unpopular standard-bearer .\nJUST WATCHED Harry Reid talks Trump , down-ballot Senate races Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Harry Reid talks Trump , down-ballot Senate races 01:57\nSenate Democrats are so deadset on this strategy that Reid publicly rebuked President Barack Obama for saying at the Democratic National Convention that Trump 's message `` was n't particularly Republican , and it sure was n't conservative . ''\n`` I would disagree with the President , '' Reid told CNN . `` The reason we have Donald Trump is because what has happened in the Congress of the United States by the Republicans ... they 've created Donald Trump . ''\nTo help save the Senate , Republicans are banking on the support of well-funded outside groups , including McConnell 's leadership PAC and the network of organizations bankrolled by the Koch brothers , who plan to spend $ 250 million on their political activities this cycle .\n`` What we 've seen is the Republican candidates we 're favoring , that we 're supporting , have been very durable , '' said Mark Holden , senior vice president of Koch Industries .\nAn NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released Friday shows Democrats with an edge nationally on the question of which party should be in charge of Congress -- 47 % of registered voters prefer a Democratic-controlled Congress , with 43 % favoring a GOP-controlled one .\nIn a conference call with reporters on Friday , several Senate Democrats sought to connect GOP senators to Trump 's latest comments on national security issues -- and urged them to officially withdraw their support .\nTrump had his first big primary win in New Hampshire in January , but a new WBUR poll out this week indicates Clinton has a 15-point lead in the state . And in a clear warning sign for the GOP , the same poll shows Sen. Kelly Ayotte trailing Democratic Gov . Maggie Hassan by 10 points .\nWhile both sides believe the New Hampshire Senate race is much tighter , the Trump effect is putting Ayotte in a bind . The first-term senator has indicated she would support Trump -- but has sought to draw a contrast with him by saying she would not endorse him and criticizing several of his more controversial statements .\nAyotte 's New Hampshire colleague , Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen , attacked GOP senators for trying to `` have it both ways '' in backing the nominee while trying to distance themselves from him .\n`` This idea that ' I support him but I do n't endorse him ' -- that 's baloney . When you support somebody , you effectively endorse them , '' Shaheen said on a conference call with reporters Friday .\nEarlier this week , Trump called Ayotte `` weak '' and declined to endorse her . Ayotte responded by saying , `` I call it like I see it , and I 'm always going to stand up for our military families and what 's best for the people of New Hampshire . ''\nGOP officials in the state note its reputation for rewarding independent-minded candidates and argue that the episode is more likely to help Ayotte with voters . But given Trump 's appeal with GOP voters in the state , Ayotte ca n't afford to alienate herself from a crucial voting bloc during a close Senate race .\nThe same holds true in Pennsylvania , a state Trump won overwhelmingly with nearly 57 % of the vote in the April GOP primary . In that state . Sen. Pat Toomey has sharply criticized Trump as the former appeals to swing voters -- particularly in the Philadelphia suburbs .\nTrump has predicted he would win Pennsylvania , a state that has a high percentage of white voters without advanced degrees , a demographic group that has overwhelmingly favored him . He continues to do well -- 53 % to 31 % -- with that voting bloc in the state , according to a poll released earlier this week by Franklin and Marshall .\nBut statewide that same poll shows Clinton with a double-digit lead -- 49 % -38 % -- over Trump .\nThe Senate race between Toomey and Katie McGinty , the Democratic challenger who served in the Clinton administration , is much tighter , with McGinty holding a 1-point lead in the same poll .\nToomey told reporters on a conference call Friday that he believed voters in his state would split their ticket in November , saying , that Trump `` is in a category unto himself . '' With respect to his own race , Toomey said voters `` will make a completely separate decision about the person they want representing them in the United States Senate , '' according to press reports .\nToomey continues to say that he is still deciding whether to officially endorse Trump .\nIn Ohio , polls before both parties ' conventions showed the presidential race in a statistical deadheat .
