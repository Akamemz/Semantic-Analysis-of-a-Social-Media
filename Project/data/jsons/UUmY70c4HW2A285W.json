    "content": "The death of Michael Brown in Ferguson , Missouri , reveals many things about America . One of them that has not yet received adequate attention is that there is a strong case for a form of gun control that is much stricter than anything that 's remotely plausible in the context of American politics .\nThis is true if you think Ferguson Police officer Darren Wilson should have been found guilty of a crime . But in many ways it 's even more true if you think he 's innocent of any wrongdoing . A system in which legal police shootings of unarmed civilians are a common occurrence is a system that has some serious flaws .\nIn this case , the drawback is a straightforward consequence of America 's approach to firearms . A well-armed citizenry required an even-better-armed constabulary . Widespread gun ownership creates a systematic climate of fear on the part of the police . The result is a quantity of police shootings that , regardless of the facts of any particular case , is just staggeringly high . Young black men , in particular , are paying the price for America 's gun culture .\nI 've seen this chart from the Economist many times since Brown 's death . But I think it 's been misinterpreted .\nFerguson is in many ways all about race and racism . But this chart reveals an important sense in which it 's not about that at all . If you know anything about the UK or Germany , you 'll know that these are not even remotely societies who 've eliminated the problem of racism . If anything , having struggled with it for less time than the United States , they 're even worse than we are . Where they outperform us is in drastically reducing the civilian death toll without ending racism or entrenched poverty or any of the St. Louis area 's other problems .\nA well-armed population leads to police shootings of the unarmed in two ways . One is that police officers have to be constantly vigilant about the possibility that they are facing a gun-wielding suspect . Cleveland police officers shot and killed a 12 year-old boy recently , because they not-entirely-unreasonably thought his toy gun was a real gun .\nThe other , more relevant to the Michael Brown case , is that when civilians are well-armed , police have to be as well . That turns every encounter into a potentially lethal situation . The officer always has to worry that if he does n't reach for and use his own gun , the suspect will . In his grand jury testimony , Wilson pointedly claims that at one point Brown put his right hand `` under his shirt into his waistband '' \u2014 i.e. , made a motion that could be plausibly construed as reaching for a gun .\nThe big reason British cops do n't shoot civilians is that cops in the United Kingdom do n't have guns . If a special situation requiring firearms arises , the call is put out for a specially trained firearms unit . But an unarmed teenager shoplifting blunts does n't make the cut , so unarmed teens do n't get shot by British cops .\nIt was genuinely striking as an American to witness the heavy police presence in Cardiff this September around the NATO summit . The relatively small city was positively flooded with cops . Unarmed cops . Cops who walked around town chatting with locals and keeping an eye on things . Armed police are such a curiosity that I heard some middle-aged Welsh ladies asking an officer if any armed units were in town to gawk at ( they were , but the officer professed not to know their whereabouts ) .\nRadley Balko 's excellent book , The Rise of the Warrior Cop , offers plenty of examples of overly militarized policing . But American cops do n't carry weapons because they 're bloodthirsty or insane . The basic reason American police departments are so much better-armed than their British counterparts is that Americans civilians are much better armed . There is about one gun per person in the United States , and the police legitimately need to be able to wield more force than the citizens they are policing . In America there are lots of guns , so the cops need lots of guns . Consequently , people get shot .\nFreedom is n't free , and a somewhat higher rate of police-involved killings could simply be the price we pay for strong gun rights . It 's the interaction with race , however , that makes this so problematic .\nThe cost of American gun ownership is n't borne evenly across the country . Black people \u2014 specifically young black men \u2014 are suffering disproportionately from both gun homicide ( which , yes , is more common where guns are widespread \u2014 it 's true that a large share of crime guns are already illegal , but the legal circulation of large quantities of small weapons makes it much easier to obtain one illegally ) and police shootings .\nTo be clear about something , since it seems very important to a lot of people who email and tweet at me , this is not some kind of crazy cosmic coincidence . It is genuinely true that men murder at a higher rate than women , that young people murder at a higher rate than old ones , and that black people murder at a higher rate than white ones .
