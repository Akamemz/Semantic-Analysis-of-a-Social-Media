    "content": "President Trump blasted his former attorney , Michael Cohen , for \u201c flipping \u201d on him and praised another ex-lieutenant with legal trouble , Paul Manafort , in an exclusive \u201c Fox & Friends \u201d interview with Ainsely Earhardt airing Thursday morning .\nThe sit-down comes during a dizzying week that saw Cohen plead guilty and Manafort get convicted for crimes that mostly had to do with their personal business dealings . But Cohen also admitted making hush money payments on behalf of Trump in what prosecutors say amounted to campaign violations .\n\u201c [ Cohen ] makes a better deal when he uses me , like everybody else , \u201d Trump said . \u201c And one of the reasons I respect Paul Manafort so much is he went through that trial\u2014you know they make up stories . People make up stories . This whole thing about flipping , they call it , I know all about flipping . \u201d\nHe continued : \u201c For 30 , 40 years I \u2019 ve been watching flippers . Everything \u2019 s wonderful and then they get 10 years in jail and they\u2014they flip on whoever the next highest one is , or as high as you can go . \u201d\nCohen , Trump 's former longtime personal attorney and self-described \u201c fixer , \u201d pleaded guilty Tuesday to five counts of tax evasion , one count of bank fraud , one count linked to an unlawful corporate contribution , and one count stemming from an illegal campaign contribution . The tax and fraud charges were tied to his dealings with a taxi business , while the campaign finance charges related to arranging payments to adult film star Storm Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal \u201c at the direction \u201d of then-candidate Trump .\nCohen is facing up to 65 years in prison on all the counts , but prosecutors have pledged to reduce his sentence sharply as part of the plea deal .\n\u201c It almost ought to be outlawed . It \u2019 s not fair . Because if somebody \u2019 s going to give\u2014spend five years like Michael Cohen , or 10 years , or 15 years in jail because of a taxi cab industry , because he defrauded some bank\u2014the last two were tiny ones , \u201d Trump explained . \u201c You know , campaign violations are considered not a big deal , frankly . But if somebody defrauded a bank and he \u2019 s going to get 10 years in jail or 20 years in jail , but if you can say something bad about Donald Trump and you \u2019 ll go down to two or three years , which is the deal he made . \u201d\nTrump said that \u201c in all fairness \u201d to Cohen , \u201c most people are going to do that . \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 ve seen it many times , \u201d Trump said . \u201c I \u2019 ve had many friends involved in this stuff . It \u2019 s called flipping and it almost ought to be illegal . \u201d\nHe laid out a scenario in which \u201c you get 10 years in jail , but if you say bad things about somebody in other words , make up stories if you don \u2019 t know . Make up . They just make up lies . I \u2019 ve seen it many times . \u201d\n\u201c They make up things and now they go from 10 years to they \u2019 re a national hero . They have a statue erected in their honor . It \u2019 s not a fair thing , but that \u2019 s why [ Cohen ] did it , \u201d Trump said .\nTrump also seemingly distanced himself from Cohen , downplaying a relationship which spanned over a decade .\n\u201c He was a lawyer for me , one of many , '' Trump said . `` You know , they always say , 'the lawyer , ' and then they like to add 'the fixer . ' \u201d Well , I don \u2019 t know if he was a 'fixer . ' I don \u2019 t know where that term came from . But he \u2019 s been a lawyer for me . Didn \u2019 t do big deals , did small deals . Not somebody that was with me that much . \u201d\nHe added : \u201c You know , they make it sound like I didn \u2019 t live with\u2014without him . I understood Michael Cohen very well . He\u2014well , it turned out he wasn \u2019 t a very good lawyer , frankly . \u201d\nTrump said that Cohen worked for him for about 10 years , and he would \u201c see him sometimes , \u201d but noted that while Cohen was involved in big deals , Trump had \u201c outside lawyers \u201d and \u201c inside lawyers , too . \u201d\n\u201c I always found him to be a nice guy , \u201d Trump said .\nAt issue involving the president is the $ 130,000 payment to Daniels in the weeks prior to the 2016 presidential election in exchange for her silence about an alleged affair with Trump , as well as the McDougal case . McDougal was paid $ 150,000 by the parent company of the National Enquirer for her , separate , story about an alleged 2006 affair with Trump , which it never published . Cohen admitted Tuesday to making an excessive campaign contribution and causing an unlawful corporate contribution .\nBut Trump insisted he only knew about hush-money payments made by Cohen \u201c later on , \u201d despite Cohen \u2019 s claims to the contrary .\n\u201c Later on I knew . Later on . What he did \u2013and they weren \u2019 t taken out of the campaign finance , that \u2019 s the big thing . That \u2019 s a much bigger thing , \u201d Trump said . \u201c Did they come out of the campaign ? They didn \u2019 t come out of the campaign , they came from me . \u201d\nHe added : \u201c In fact , my first question when I heard about it was , did they come out of the campaign , because that could be a little dicey . And they didn \u2019 t come out of the campaign and that \u2019 s big . But they weren \u2019 t\u2026that \u2019 s not even a campaign violation . \u201d\n\u201c If you look at President Obama , he had a massive campaign violation but he had a different attorney general and they viewed it a lot differently , \u201d Trump said . Trump was referring to Obama 's 2008 campaign being fined $ 375,000 by the Federal Election Commission for a series of missing notices for more than 1,300 contributions . They totaled $ 1.8 million .\nTrump , though , went on to criticize Attorney General Jeff Sessions , saying he \u201c never took control of the Justice Department . '' When asked whether he would fire Sessions or Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , he maintained that he wants to \u201c stay uninvolved \u201d with the DOJ .\n\u201c Jeff Sessions recused himself , which he shouldn \u2019 t have done . Or he should have told me , \u201d Trump said . \u201c Even my enemies say that Jeff Sessions should have told you that he was going to recuse himself and then you wouldn \u2019 t have put him in . He took the job and then he said I \u2019 m going to recuse myself . I said , \u2018 what kind of man is this ? \u2019 \u201d\nTrump added that the \u201c only reason \u201d he appointed him as attorney general was \u201c because I felt loyalty . \u201d\n\u201c He was an original supporter . He was on the campaign . He knows there was no collusion , \u201d Trump said . \u201c And what \u2019 s come out of Manafort ? No collusion . What \u2019 s come out of Michael Cohen ? No collusion . \u201d\nThis week , Manafort , Trump 's former campaign chairman , was charged on eight counts of tax fraud as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s investigation . Unlike Cohen , Trump noted in the exclusive interview with \u201c Fox & Friends , \u201d Manafort did not \u2018 flip . \u2019\n`` I have great respect for what he 's done in terms of what he 's going through . You know , he worked for Ronald Reagan for years . He worked for Bob Dole . He worked , I guess his firm worked , for [ Sen. John ] McCain . He worked for many , many people many , many years , and I would say what he did , some of the charges they threw against him , every consultant , every lobbyist in Washington probably does , '' Trump said .\nHe added : `` If you look at Hillary Clinton 's person , you take a look at the people that work for Hillary Clinton , and look at the crimes that Clinton did with the emails and she deletes 33,000 emails after she gets a subpoena from Congress , and this Justice Department does nothing about it and all of the other crimes that they 've done . ''\nTrump said he `` did n't know Manafort well , '' and that his charges were `` on things totally unrelated to the campaign . ''\n`` And by the way , they got Cohen on [ charges ] totally unrelated to the campaign , '' Trump explained . `` I 'm not involved . I was n't charged with anything . You know , people do n't like to say that , but I was n't charged . ''",
