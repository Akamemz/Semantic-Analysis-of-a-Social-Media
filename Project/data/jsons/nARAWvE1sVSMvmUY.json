She turned to her top Democratic primary challenger , and created the visual to go with the words , shaking Senator Sanders \u2019 s hand and grinning broadly .\nThe message : We ( Democrats ) are a united party \u2013 even if Mr. Sanders technically isn \u2019 t a Democrat \u2013 and the Republicans aren \u2019 t .\nMake no mistake , Mrs. Clinton is not out of the woods on the issue that has dogged her for eight months : Her exclusive use of a private e-mail system while secretary of State , raising questions about whether she put national security at risk . She will testify before a House committee next week on the matter .\nBut in that moment on the debate stage in Las Vegas , Clinton got a gift . Her support among Democrats has sunk below 50 percent , and her ratings among all voters for honesty and trustworthiness have gone south . Sanders was turning the focus back to the issues \u2013 particularly the rising income inequality that drives his campaign \u2013 but in the process he neutralized perhaps his biggest argument against Clinton : questions about her character .\nAnd thus the highly anticipated first Democratic debate stayed focused on policy , in sharp contrast to the large Republican field \u2019 s three-ring circus-like quality in its first two debates . Clinton solidified her status as the queen of the Democrats , the odds-on favorite to win her party \u2019 s nomination \u2013 and , as she reminded viewers several times , positioned to become the first woman president of the United States .\n\u201c It \u2019 s clear that there was only one person on the stage in Las Vegas who can actually be the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee \u2013 Hillary Clinton , \u201d says Republican strategist Ford O \u2019 Connell . \u201c Clinton was hungry and improved from her 2008 performances but her competition was beyond weak . The progressive base might love Sanders , but his \u2018 town crier \u2019 routine will never fly in the general election . \u201d\nBut make no mistake , Sanders is no mere sparring partner for Clinton . He has had a profound impact on the Democratic race . He has electrified liberal stalwarts with his fiery populist rhetoric , drawing huge crowds in contrast with Clinton \u2019 s polite turnouts . In the last fundraising quarter , he raised nearly as much as Clinton \u2013 $ 26 million to her $ 28 million \u2013 mostly in small-dollar Internet donations , requiring far-fewer private , high-dollar fundraising events than Clinton .\nIn the process , Sanders has nudged Clinton \u2013 and therefore the party \u2019 s center of gravity \u2013 to the left on key issues , including trade and climate change .
