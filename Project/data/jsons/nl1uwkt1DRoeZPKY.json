    "content": "Attorney General Eric Holder was just months into the job when he announced plans to prosecute the mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks and other alleged co-conspirators in a New York courtroom , rather than through the Guantanamo Bay military commission process .\nIt was an audacious idea , but immediately beset by political opposition and public safety concerns . The Obama administration 's eventual decision to walk away from the proposal was a stinging defeat for Holder and a reminder of the complexities of the legal fight against terrorism .\nHolder , who announced Thursday that he would step down once a successor is confirmed , took office determined to turn the page from Bush administration policies that authorized harsh interrogation techniques against suspected terrorists . But he will leave with a mixed record of national security decisions that have drawn their own scrutiny and disappointed those who felt he did n't go far enough to distance the Justice Department from past practices .\nThe department points to hundreds of terrorism-fighting successes during Holder 's tenure , including prosecutions of plots to explode a bomb in Times Square and on a Detroit-bound airliner .\nBut also under his watch , the department authorized targeted drone strikes against Americans abroad , subpoenaed journalists ' telephone records in leak investigations and defended in court the government 's bulk collection of millions of Americans ' telephone records .\n`` It 's a complex legacy that I think is somewhat disappointing on national security , '' said Seton Hall University law professor Jonathan Hafetz , a former senior lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union .\nOverall , Hafetz said he believed Holder , attorney general since the start of Obama 's presidency in 2009 , had been `` too supportive of executive power and insufficiently protective of civil liberties .
