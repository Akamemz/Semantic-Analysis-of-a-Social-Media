Rather than arguing about its exact position , we would surely be shocked at its presence almost 7,000 miles from Iran . But on June 20 , Iran downed a US drone that had come close to its territory ( according to the Pentagon ) or violated its airspace ( according to Tehran ) , and almost nobody asked if the US military presence in the Persian Gulf was justified .
