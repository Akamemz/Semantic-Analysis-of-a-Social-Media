It \u2019 s part of the senators \u2019 larger critique of a soon-to-be-released report by the Democratic staff that will detail what President Obama said was \u201c torture \u201d of prisoners in CIA custody .\nFormer Bush-era CIA officials have argued in the past that the interrogations of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed ( KSM ) and Abu Faraj al-Libbi led to the discovery of bin Laden in his compound in Pakistan . The White House and other officials , including former CIA Director Leon Panetta , have vigorously disputed that claim . Senate Republicans are pledging that their addendum to the imminent Senate Intelligence Committee majority staff report on CIA activities will reveal new information that harsh interrogations did help get Bin Laden .

The release will also include a lengthy defense by the CIA and a minority dissent written primarily by the staff of the committee \u2019 s ranking Republican , Saxby Chambliss . Chambliss \u2019 office circulated talking points to Republican offices in anticipation of the report \u2019 s release , obtained by The \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\n\u201c A number of the Study \u2019 s findings and conclusions are erroneous and misleading , \u201d the first talking point reads . \u201c Bottom line : the CIA \u2019 s Detention and Interrogation program did develop significant intelligence that helped us identify and capture important al-Qa \u2019 ida terrorists , disrupt their ongoing plotting , and take down Usama Bin Ladin. \u201d The document offered no additional evidence to back up this claim .\nFeinstein \u2019 s report\u2014which was compiled after a five-year investigation involving the review of over 6 million documents related to the CIA \u2019 s rendition , detention , and interrogation practices\u2014is expected to claim that harsh interrogation techniques provided didn \u2019 t contribute to thwarting any terrorist plots .\nChambliss sought to frame the debate Sunday on CBS \u2019 s Face the Nation , where he preemptively attacked Feinstein \u2019 s report .\n\u201c There is a theory on the part of the Senate Democrats\u2026 that no significant information was obtained as a result of the use of those enhanced interrogation techniques .

John McCain during a meeting of Senate Republicans last week over whether enhanced interrogation techniques amounted to torture , according to a senior GOP senate staffer . McCain , who spent five years in captivity and suffered torture at the hands of the Viet Cong , has long argued that waterboarding is torture and its use runs counter to American laws and values .\nPresident Obama said last Friday , \u201c We tortured some folks , \u201d when announcing that the White House had passed back to Feinstein the final round of redactions and declassifications .
