    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 There is no vacancy at the Supreme Court , but liberal and conservative activists are ready to do battle over one .\nThe potential retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy \u2014 the deciding vote on dozens of controversial cases over a 30-year career \u2014 has energized both sides for what likely would be the most divisive confirmation battle in decades .\nStrategy sessions are being held with increasing frequency . Commercial messages are being crafted in favor and against any potential nominee . Moderate senators on both sides of the political aisle whose votes will be critical already have targets on their backs .\nUnlike last year , when Justice Neil Gorsuch of Colorado was confirmed to the seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia , a fellow conservative , any nominee chosen by President Trump would push the court further to the right .
