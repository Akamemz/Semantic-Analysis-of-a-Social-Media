The CMA represents 38,000 of the roughly 104,000 doctors in California .\nSo why exactly the push back ? Under Obamcare , doctors are practically expected to work for free .\n\u201c We need some recognition that we \u2019 re doing a service to the community . But we can \u2019 t do it for free . And we can \u2019 t do it at a loss .

And reimbursement rates for some procedures are even lower .\nOnce again the argument that Republicans are blocking Obamacare 's implementation and fear mongering about the law is completely blown out of the water . This is n't the first time we 've seen major concerns or push back against Obamcare in the Golden State . Earlier this year , top California Democrat and Insurance Commission Dave Jones warned about fraud and identity theft risks posed to consumers on the exchanges .\nThe state insurance commissioner and anti-fraud groups say the exchange is falling short in ensuring that the people hired as counselors are adequately screened and monitored .\nInsurance Commissioner Dave Jones also said the exchange does not have a plan for investigating any complaints that might arise once the counselors start work . That means consumers who might fall prey to bogus health care products , identity theft and other abuses will have a hard time seeking justice if unscrupulous counselors get ahold of their Social Security number , bank accounts , health records or other private information , he said .\n`` We can have a real disaster on our hands , '' Jones , a Democrat , said in an interview .\nDoctors boycotting Obamacare is the least of our worries , the biggest problem is doctors choosing the leave medicine completely as a result of the healthcare law . According to a recent survey , more than 60 percent of doctors plan to leave medicine early as Obamacare changes the way America does medicine .\nMost physicians have a pessimistic outlook on the future of medicine , citing eroding autonomy and falling income , a survey of more than 600 doctors found .\nSix in 10 physicians ( 62 % ) said it is likely many of their colleagues will retire earlier than planned in the next 1 to 3 years , a survey from Deloitte Center for Health Solutions found .
