Let 's just talk about the ways pop culture can chip away at the soul , the ways a jokey demonstration of a game or an imaginary Twitter fight or yet another celebrity explaining that she believes in equality but do n't call her a feminist or the sound of that song that just would n't go away can make a person realize how far we still have to go . There were truly far too many contenders to choose from this year , but these were the sexist lowlights that raised our blood pressure most .\nIt turned out `` Diane , '' the huffy airline passenger in the medical mask , never even existed . What Buzzfeed dubbed an `` epic '' encounter that `` won '' Thanksgiving was instead merely the `` Bachelor '' producer 's stunt to `` entertain some people '' with `` a cautionary tale . '' Gale 's `` entertaining , '' `` cautionary '' message ? You can pretend to send a strange woman a note saying , `` Eat my dick '' and be lauded as a champion of civility . Got it .\nIn an inadvertently revealing feature on Bleacher Report co-founder Bryan Goldberg 's attempt to `` redefine what 'women \u2019 s interest ' looks like , '' the New Yorker showed the world a man who 's disappointed . Disappointed , because `` Honestly , nothing would have been more helpful here than for some highly regarded feminist writers to say , 'Bryan \u2019 s a good person . ' '' A man who explains , `` I am a dude . I don \u2019 t have a lot of overlapping interests with most women my age . I \u2019 m really into history . I \u2019 m really into markets and finance . I don \u2019 t know a damn thing about beauty , but I don \u2019 t need to . '' Because those unhelpful feminists would n't be into history or finance . And the photo accompanying the whole thing ? It was of a thoughtful Goldberg sprawled on the floor and surrounded by a gaggle of female employees , tapping away on a laptop perched on a high-heeled , short-skirted woman 's lap . Who says it 's tough for women to find desk jobs ?\nGoodness , where to begin ? James Taranto boo-hooing over a `` war on men '' and `` an effort to criminalize male sexuality '' in a story on military sexual assault ? Richard Cohen 's bizarre Miley Cyrus-centric complaining about `` the so-called Steubenville Rape '' ( an odd term for a crime that has so far led to two rape convictions ) ? How about CNN 's pity party for the rapists ? Maybe a Fox News guest 's assertion that women should `` thank men '' for freeing us up `` to embrace that side of yourself that isn \u2019 t about work '' ? We could list all the ways the media gave a platform to Dark Ages ignorance , but we 'd be here till 2015 .\nWhat do you if you 're a `` premium '' clothing brand faced with accusations of deteriorating quality in your merchandise ? If you 're Chip Wilson , you oh so subtly suggest maybe the problem is your fat , scratchy thighs , lady \u2013 perhaps because his company 's pants only go up to size 12 anyway . In a Bloomberg interview in November , the company founder said , `` Some women \u2019 s bodies just actually don \u2019 t work for it \u2026 They don \u2019 t work for some women \u2019 s bodies . It \u2019 s about the rubbing through the thighs , [ and ] how much pressure is there . '' Women and their thighs protested otherwise . Wilson abruptly stepped down as company chairman a month later .\nSpeaking of body wars . First , she laid down the gauntlet \u2013 and got herself a whole lot of free publicity \u2013 by posing in an abs-flaunting ensemble surrounded by her three children and provocatively asking , `` What 's your excuse ? '' Then Kang ramped it up by ranting against Curvy Girl Lingerie \u2019 s campaign of plus-sized women posting photos of themselves in their underwear and complaining , `` We \u2019 re normalizing obesity in our society . '' To cap it all off , she confidently told ABC in early December , `` I said you can just tell by looking at someone if they are fit or not\u2026 . Anyone can tell this with a bare naked eye looking at a bare naked stomach . '' For her obsessive fat-shaming , Kang is proof that a woman can be just as backward and toxic as any man .\nThere was the New York Post 's catty Hillary Clinton cover saying , `` No wonder Bill 's afraid . '' There was the time Julia Gillard 's `` small breasts , huge thighs and big red box '' were the menu items at an Australian fundraiser . There was Wendy Davis ' depiction as an `` abortion Barbie . '' There was the outraged backlash against British MP Jo Swinson and the question of whether she `` hates women , '' because she had the audacity to stand during Prime Minister \u2019 s Questions , despite being seven months pregnant . In short , if it involved a woman who managed to ever be elected or appointed to an office , chances are someone had something terrible to say about it .\nRemember when Adria Richards tweeted a photo of some men she said were making crude comments during a conference ? When the men were fired , Richards was threatened , harassed and canned from her job . During TechCrunch 's Disrupt conference , a pair of dudes unveiled a TitStare app and another got up and pantomimed masturbation . And at E3 , a live `` Killer Instinct '' demo featured a male player telling his female opponent , `` Just let it happen . It 'll be over soon .

'' Yes , it 's true , biology fans \u2013 being able to have a son instead of a daughter is not a matter of sex-determining chromosomes but brilliance .
