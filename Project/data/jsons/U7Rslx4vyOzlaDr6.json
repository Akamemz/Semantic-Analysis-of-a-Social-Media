And more importantly , why now ?\nOrchestrating the chaos , as always , was Trump himself , who largely stayed out of public view last week but managed to incite pandemonium nonetheless .\nIn a dizzying sequence of events , sacked acting Attorney General Sally Yates warned in Senate testimony Monday that ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn was a ripe blackmail target for Russia while in office . The President suddenly fired FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday , and then blindsided his own vice president with his shifting reasoning before sabotaging the White House press operation that was trying to defend him . Amid reports he demanded a loyalty pledge from Comey , critics warned Trump was guilty of a grotesque abuse of power , or even worse . But the President was not done . He suggested that Comey 's investigation into links between his presidential campaign and Russia were indeed the reason he was fired .\nIn a Friday morning tweetstorm , he seemed to suggest he had a Nixon-style White House taping operation , and told Comey to stay mum . Next , he proposed ending press briefings because it 's impossible for his communications team to keep up with the whiplash of his stream-of-consciousness presidency .\nTrump 's behavior provoked confusion and criticism in Washington . But the President is defiant and may have had his detractors in mind as he delivered a commencement address Saturday at Liberty University , in Virginia .\n`` No one has ever achieved anything significant without a chorus of critics standing on the sideline saying why it ca n't be done , '' Trump said . `` Nothing is easier or more pathetic than being a critic .

It 's now normal to observe that Trump is not like a conventional politician , that the point of his political project is to flout norms and shake up the cozy establishment and that the press takes him too literally .\nAnd when Trump behaves in a way that has the media and Washington establishment types running around with their hair on fire , his loyal base of voters who sent him to the White House see a mission accomplished .\nJUST WATCHED What do Trump 's denials on 'tapes ' and 'loyalty ' really mean ?
