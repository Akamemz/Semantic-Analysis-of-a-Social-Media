    "content": "In March , Merrick Garland set out to become a Supreme Court justice , but instead , nearly eight months later he has become the unofficial mascot of Washington dysfunction .\nWhen he was nominated in the spring , just after the unexpected death of longtime conservative icon , Justice Antonin Scalia , Garland was given the royal judicial treatment : Democratic aligned groups anointed him with millions of dollars of positive ads in Washington and in key battleground states , while conservative groups spent their own millions portraying him as an anti-gun tyrant .\nLate last month , just before the Senate gaveled out of session until just after the election , Democrats mustered one last effort to pressure Republican leaders to take Garland up . But parading Garland around the Capitol for a second round of talks with Democratic leaders didn \u2019 t quite have the desired effect .\nThat \u2019 s in part because Republicans weren \u2019 t aware Garland was even at the Capitol .\n\u201c No , I don \u2019 t think I did , \u201d Sen. Jeff Flake ( R-Ariz. ) replied when asked by The \u2588\u2588\u2588 if he knew Garland was recently at the Capitol .\nAnd he \u2019 s one of the few GOP allies Garland has in today \u2019 s bitterly partisan Senate .\nFlake believes his party miscalculated on Garland from the evening Scalia died and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell shut the door on confirming anyone\u2014from a Republican ally to a moderate like Garland\u2014that President Obama put forward to fill the vacancy .\n\u201c Our position shouldn \u2019 t be that the next president ought to decide . Nobody really believes that , because if this were the last year of a Republican presidency nobody would say that , \u201d Flake said with a chuckle . \u201c Our position ought to be to confirm the most conservative justice to replace Scalia\u2014to maintain the balance on the Court . That ought to be the principle , and that would allow for us to go with Garland if the alternative is somebody more liberal . \u201d\nBut that \u2019 s not the principle espoused by Republican leaders . The new rule\u2014one could say , the McConnell Rule\u2014is that no ( Democratic ) president is able to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court in their final year in office .\n\u201c It \u2019 s never [ been ] about Garland , it \u2019 s always been about the principle , \u201d Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley ( R-Iowa ) told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 . Months ago , when Grassley teamed up with McConnell to block Garland , Democrats felt the wind at their backs and fielded a candidate to take on the six term senator .\nThey found just the judge to take him on : Patty Judge . Initially Judge\u2014a farmer and former state senator\u2014looked promising as her campaign was fueled by outside money blasting Grassley for rudely obstructing Garland .\nBut as the summer months rolled on and Republicans made clear that Garland was a non-starter ahead of November , Judge \u2019 s campaign never took root and Grassley looks to be coasting to a seventh term .\nStill , Democrats aren \u2019 t giving up and think they have a winning issue , even if that meant parading around a Supreme Court nominee who the press corps , Republicans and even his supporters have largely given up on .\n\u201c They should understand that their candidates are being hurt by not having a vote on Merrick Garland , \u201d Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid told reporters during a recent press conference . \u201c This is untoward and the Supreme Court has been hamstrung as a result of them wanting Donald Trump to appoint the next Supreme Court justice . \u201d\nBut the McConnell Rule is curious , because it seems to only apply to the High Court . Republicans have been holding hearings to fill the more than twenty vacancies in federal district courts .\nJust two weeks ago , the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on five Texas judges .

The state \u2019 s Republican senators are advocating their speedy approval by the full Senate .\n\u201c We \u2019 ll try to make the case that that should happen in the lame duck session , \u201d Sen. John Cornyn ( R-Texas ) told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c We \u2019 d like to do it now , but there \u2019 s probably not enough time to get it done . \u201d\nWhile the Texans are pushing their home state nominees , they \u2019 re opposed to holding hearings on Garland or anyone else the president might have picked to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court .\n\u201c Mitch McConnell and Chuck Grassley have rightly held the line , \u201d Sen.
