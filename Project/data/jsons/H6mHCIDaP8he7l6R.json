    "content": "Former Vice President Biden and President Trump were both , in their own unique ways , addressing the biggest story of the past few weeks .\nIt was Tuesday , June 9 , and Joe Biden was speaking\u2014virtually\u2014at the funeral of George Floyd , the black man whose death under the knee of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin tore the Band-Aid off the racial wound in America that all too many had been all too willing to ignore . \u201c To George \u2019 s family and friends , Jill and I know the deep hole in your hearts when you bury a piece of your soul deep in this Earth , \u201d Biden said in a video that played over the faint tickling of piano keys in Houston \u2019 s Fountain of Praise church . \u201c We know you will never feel the same again . \u2026 Unlike most , you must grieve in public . It \u2019 s a burden . A burden that is now your purpose to change the world for the better , in the name of George Floyd . \u201d\nThat same morning , Donald Trump \u2019 s attention was focused on the widespread protests and unrest that had beset the country in the wake of Floyd \u2019 s killing . \u201c Buffalo protester shoved by Police could be an ANTIFA provocateur , \u201d he tweeted , referencing a viral video in which a 75-year-old man was pushed to the sidewalk by police and could be seen bleeding from his ear . \u201c He fell harder than was pushed . Was aiming scanner . Could be a set up ? \u201d\nThis is not to say Trump hasn \u2019 t discussed Floyd \u2019 s death\u2014he has . \u201c The death of George Floyd on the streets of Minneapolis was a grave tragedy . It should never have happened , \u201d he declared on May 30 after the launch of the SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft in Cape Canaveral , Florida . \u201c I understand the pain that people are feeling. \u201d But off-prompter the president quickly returned to his preferred \u201c law and order \u201d message on the demonstrations , and a week later was in the Rose Garden imagining Floyd \u201c looking down \u201d and saying of what had happened in his name since his death , \u201c This is a great thing that \u2019 s happening for our country . \u201d\nThese anecdotes represent a tiny fraction of the various issues that will be weighing on voters \u2019 minds when they head to the ballot box in November , but they speak to a growing problem for the president and his quest for a second term . In a campaign that , as of now , is defined by a pandemic , mass unemployment , and a citizenry increasingly coming to terms with racial injustices , Trump has an empathy problem\u2014and it \u2019 s only getting worse .\nThis isn \u2019 t a new conundrum for Trump : Even some of his staunchest supporters wouldn \u2019 t describe the president as compassionate\u2014the brashness is part of the appeal . But 2020 is not 2016 , and Joe Biden is not Hillary Clinton . Trump was able to squeak out a victory in the Electoral College four years ago with only 44 percent likely voters thinking he \u201c cares about average Americans , \u201d in large part because only 53 percent thought his Democratic opponent did . In an August 2016 NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll , one in five respondents reported believing neither major-party candidate cared about people like them .\nThat is decidedly not the case this year . What was a 9-point empathy gap between Trump and Clinton in 2016 has grown to 19 points with Joe Biden on the ticket . Sixty-one percent of registered voters in a May poll from Quinnipiac University think Biden cares about average Americans\u2014an eight-point increase over Clinton overall , but a 15-point increase with independents and a 6-point increase among Republicans . The former vice president \u2019 s numbers on the question improved by two points since March\u2014taking into account his forcefully denial of a sexual assault allegation made by former Senate staffer Tara Reade .\n\u201c I think the Trump campaign has to be perpetually professionally paranoid simply because of the narrowness of his majority in 2016 and the lack of apparent ability to expand that coalition going into 2020 , \u201d said Michael Steel , a veteran of several Republican presidential campaigns . \u201c They have to be cognizant of the fact that Secretary Clinton brought huge negatives\u2014built by decades of unpopularity\u2014into the 2016 race . So running against former Vice President Biden\u2014who doesn \u2019 t have nearly that kind of baggage\u2014is an inherently more difficult challenge . \u201d\nSteel worked on Mitt Romney \u2019 s 2012 campaign , where the candidate was , like Trump , dogged by an inability to radiate compassion with the majority of the country\u2014albeit for entirely different reasons . Mike Huckabee , Romney \u2019 s rival for the GOP nomination in 2008 , savaged the former head of Bain Capital with a line that reverberated four years later : \u201c I want to be a president who reminds you of the guy you work with , not the guy who laid you off. \u201d Romney \u2019 s leaked \u201c 47 percent \u201d comments\u2014in which he appeared to write off nearly half the country as people \u201c dependent upon government \u201d who will vote for Barack Obama \u201c no matter what \u201d \u2014only solidified an existing perception .\nExit polls in 2012 illustrated just how damaging this image was for Romney . Barack Obama maintained a 10-point advantage on being \u201c in touch \u201d with average Americans , per ABC News , and won voters who prioritized empathy by an extraordinary 63 points . It didn \u2019 t matter that Romney won those who cared about a candidate \u201c sharing their values , \u201d \u201c being a strong leader , \u201d or \u201c having a vision for the future \u201d \u2014the cake was already baked .\nIn many ways , the issues at hand in 2012 seem quaint compared with the various catastrophes of the past four months . If empathy was important eight years ago , it \u2019 s hard to imagine it won \u2019 t be doubly so in November , when we could be nearing 200,000 dead from the coronavirus and have tens of millions out of work . President Trump \u2019 s culture war over Confederate monuments , incessant bashing of the news media , and photo op in front of St. John \u2019 s Church will undoubtedly excite his existing base of voters . But\u2014as Biden \u2019 s 8-point lead over Trump in the RealClearPolitics polling average suggests\u2014these battles are cold comfort to the millions of Americans dealing with loss and looking for leadership through one of the most harrowing periods in recent U.S. history .\n\u201c We expect the American president to offer words of comfort and healing and unity in the face of national crises , \u201d Steel noted , \u201c and President Trump either refuses or seems very awkward when he tries . \u201d\nThe Trump campaign , for its part , did not directly address the question of the president \u2019 s capacity for empathy in a statement provided to \u2588\u2588\u2588 , opting instead to focus on his actions . \u201c President Trump has proven he is the leader we need in these tough times , \u201d spokesman Ken Farnaso said in an email . \u201c In the face of the pandemic , President Trump implemented a Whole-of-America approach leading to the greatest public and private sector mobilization effort since WW2 . Following the tragic death of George Floyd , President Trump swiftly called on the Department of Justice to investigate the heinous actions of the Minneapolis police officers involved . Despite false narratives promoted by the Democrats and media , the President \u2019 s unifying message is resonating with Americans throughout our country while Joe Biden continues to lean on divisive rhetoric and broken policies . \u201d\nThe Biden campaign did not respond to a request for comment , but allies believe the former vice president \u2019 s entire life\u2014tragedies and all\u2014has prepared him for this moment . \u201c I think he has a unique ability to connect with people in such a way because of his sets of life experiences , \u201d Democratic strategist Antjuan Seawright told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c We \u2019 ve lived through some of the experiences Joe Biden has had with one of his kids , he lost his wife . We lived through that , but we \u2019 ve also been with him while he \u2019 s been able to console other people and help them get through their experiences . \u201d\nBiden \u2019 s first wife , Neilia , and his daughter , Naomi , were killed in a car accident just after Biden , 30 , was first elected to the Senate . His oldest son , Beau , died from brain cancer in 2015 at the age of 46 . And like George Floyd \u2019 s daughter Gianna and his brother Philonise , Biden grieved in public .
