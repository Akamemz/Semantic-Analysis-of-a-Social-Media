    "content": "On 9/11 , a day devoted to remembering those killed at the hands of Islamofascist terrorists -- and this year , a day when a mob in Egypt attacks the US embassy and replaces the American flag with the Al Qaeda one -- here is the Obama administration 's statement in full :\nThe Embassy of the United States in Cairo condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims \u2013 as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions . Today , the 11th anniversary of the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States , Americans are honoring our patriots and those who serve our nation as the fitting response to the enemies of democracy .
