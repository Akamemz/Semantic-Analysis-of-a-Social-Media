The other was Trade Adjustment Assistance , a safety net aimed at retraining any U.S. workers who might lose their jobs as a result of the new trade package .\nThe simplified version of what happened is this : Democrats really like TAA . Republicans like TPA . Boehner split them into separate votes , hoping Dems and Republicans would vote for the respective parts they liked .

The House voted today to give themselves until July 30 to get the votes they need to get the package passed . And by the numbers , it 's clear that Obama and the House GOP have their work cut out for them in procuring those votes .\nIn an extremely polarized Congress , that 's an unusually haphazard-looking mix of votes .
