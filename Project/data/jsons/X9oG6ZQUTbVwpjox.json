He served turkey and thanked the troops , delivered a speech and sat down with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani before leaving just after midnight . He arrived back in Florida , where he is spending the holiday weekend , early Friday morning local time .\nAs per tradition , reporters were under strict instructions to keep the trip a secret to ensure the president \u2019 s safety in Afghanistan . About 12,000 U.S. forces remain in the country .\nTraveling with Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming and a small clutch of aides , including his acting chief of staff , press secretary and national security adviser , Trump appeared in good spirits as he was escorted around the base by heavily armed soldiers , as the smell of burning fuel and garbage wafted through the chilly air .

U.S. and international forces have been on the ground ever since .\nIt was not immediately clear how long or substantive the U.S. reengagement with the Taliban has been .\nTaliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the Taliban \u2019 s stance is unchanged .

For months now , he has described American forces as \u201c policemen \u201d and argued that other countries \u2019 wars should be theirs to wage .\nTens of thousands of Afghan civilians and more than 2,400 American service members have been killed since the war began 18 years ago .\nJust last week , Trump flew to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to oversee the transfer of the remains of two Army officers killed when their helicopter crashed as they provided security for troops on the ground in Logar province in eastern Afghanistan .
