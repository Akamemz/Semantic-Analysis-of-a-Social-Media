President Obama \u2019 s priority is , and always has been , the Muslim world .

There is an inconvenient discord between the terrorism and violence emanating from his BFF \u2019 s and his putative job as commander-in-chief .\nThe difficulty presents itself , for example , in the context of Benghazi . The anger over Benghazi is more than justified , but not because it is still a mystery why the president sent no one to bomb Libya in order to save Americans under attack . He may have hurt somebody on the ground who was not American , or he may have stirred up local resentment .\nPresident Obama has never made a secret of his \u201c counter-terrorism \u201d policy .

It \u2019 s that he isn \u2019 t right . International law does not require planning for zero civilian casualties \u2013 which would simply encourage combatants to use more civilians as human shields . The Geneva Conventions test is one of proportionality : \u201c An attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life [ or ] injury to civilians \u201d is prohibited if it \u201c would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated . \u201d\nSo international law is not what is driving President Obama \u2019 s foreign policy .
