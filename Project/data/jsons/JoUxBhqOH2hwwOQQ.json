    "content": "A new piece of evidence has emerged buttressing the credibility of Tara Reade \u2019 s claim that she told her mother about allegations of sexual harassment and assault related to her former boss , then-Sen. Joe Biden . Biden , through a spokesperson , has denied the allegations . Reade has claimed to various media outlets , including \u2588\u2588\u2588 , that she told her mother , a close friend , and her brother about both the harassment and , to varying degrees of detail , the assault at the time . Her brother , Collin Moulton , and her friend , who has asked to remain anonymous , both confirmed that they heard about the allegations from Reade at the time . Reade \u2019 s mother died in 2016 , but both her brother and friend also confirmed Reade had told her mother , and that her mother , a longtime feminist and activist , urged her to go to the police . In interviews with \u2588\u2588\u2588 , Reade also mentioned that her mother had made a phone call to \u201c Larry King Live \u201d on CNN , during which she made reference to her daughter \u2019 s experience on Capitol Hill . Reade told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that her mother called in asking for advice after Reade , then in her 20s , left Biden \u2019 s office . \u201c I remember it being an anonymous call and her saying my daughter was sexually harassed and retaliated against and fired , where can she go for help ? I was mortified , \u201d Reade told me . Reade couldn \u2019 t remember the date or the year of the phone call , and King didn \u2019 t include the names of callers on his show . I was unable to find the call , but mentioned it in an interview with Katie Halper , the podcast host who first aired Reade \u2019 s allegation . After the podcast aired , a listener managed to find the call and sent it to \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nOn August 11 , 1993 , King aired a program titled , \u201c Washington : The Cruelest City on Earth ? \u201d Toward the end of the program , he introduces a caller dialing in from San Luis Obispo , California . Congressional records list August 1993 as Reade \u2019 s last month of employment with Biden \u2019 s Senate office , and , according to property records , Reade \u2019 s mother , Jeanette Altimus , was living in San Luis Obispo County . Here is the transcript of the beginning of the call : KING : San Luis Obispo , California , hello . CALLER : Yes , hello . I \u2019 m wondering what a staffer would do besides go to the press in Washington ? My daughter has just left there , after working for a prominent senator , and could not get through with her problems at all , and the only thing she could have done was go to the press , and she chose not to do it out of respect for him . KING : In other words , she had a story to tell but , out of respect for the person she worked for , she didn \u2019 t tell it ? CALLER : That \u2019 s true . King \u2019 s panel of guests offered no suggestions , and instead the conversation veered into a discussion of whether any of the men on set would leak damaging personal information about a rival to the press .\nReade , after being read the transcript of the call , said that it gelled with her memory of it , and , after the video was surfaced , confirmed it is her mother \u2019 s voice on the call . \u201c Aww , I have not heard my mom \u2019 s voice in awhile , \u201d she said . There are several notable things about the emergence of the call . On the one hand , the caller does not specifically mention \u201c sexual harassment \u201d or retaliation , as Reade had recalled . On the other hand , the reference to being unable to \u201c get through with her problems \u201d aligns with Reade \u2019 s claim that she complained to superiors in Biden \u2019 s office and got nowhere , and the reference to going to the press makes clear that the caller is talking about more than just generic problems at the office . The problems , she makes clear , would damage the senator if exposed . Reade \u2019 s inability to remember the exact date of the alleged assault , or its precise location , or the precise location of the office where she picked up the form needed to file a complaint , has been used by skeptics to suggest the allegation is fabricated . What the emergence of the call shows is that even if Reade \u2019 s memory is off on timing or details , the substance of her claims \u2014 in this case , that her mother called Larry King and discussed her situation \u2014 can still be true .\nThe call also calls into question the credibility of Biden \u2019 s denial . Reade said that she filed a complaint about Biden \u2019 s harassment with Marianne Baker , effectively the office manager in the Biden office . The Biden campaign released a statement from Baker , which said that neither Reade nor any other employee had ever complained about improper behavior . \u201c In all my years working for Senator Biden , I never once witnessed , or heard of , or received , any reports of inappropriate conduct , period \u2014 not from Ms. Reade , not from anyone , \u201d Baker said in the campaign \u2019 s statement . \u201c These clearly false allegations are in complete contradiction to both the inner workings of our Senate office and to the man I know and worked so closely with for almost two decades. \u201d For Baker \u2019 s statement to be true , Reade would have had to have lied to her friend , brother , and mother about having complained to Biden \u2019 s office . There is no obvious reason Reade would make up a story to those closest to her about the Senate office not taking Biden \u2019 s harassment seriously , while at the same time resisting pressure to go to the press . Reade has said that the complaint she filed was related to the harassment she said she faced , and did not address the assault . The complaint was left with Biden \u2019 s office , and if it still exists , is with Biden \u2019 s papers at the University of Delaware . The school recently told reporter Rich McHugh that the papers are sealed until two years after Biden leaves public life .\nAnd @ UDelaware -- which houses the collection of Joe Biden 's senatorial papers -- just confirmed to me that the papers `` will remain closed to the public until two years after Mr. Biden retires from public life .
