    "content": "Long , long before he was Donald Trump \u2019 s personal attorney and devoted defender , Rudy Giuliani wasn \u2019 t exactly a fan . The first time , actually , he invoked Trump \u2019 s name in a high-profile , high-stakes setting , Giuliani was the prosecutor in a public corruption case .\nThe setting was the federal courthouse in New Haven , Connecticut , in 1986 . Giuliani was the top gun from the Southern District of New York . And the main defendant , accused of taking kickbacks from companies for whom he helped score contracts with the city \u2019 s Parking Violations Bureau , was Stanley Friedman\u2014a former deputy mayor , the Democratic Party chair in the Bronx and a lobbyist who the year before had netted nearly a million dollars . He typically sported a goatee , pinstriped suits with a pocket square and glasses with his initials in rhinestones . He spent his days on the phone , chain-chomping cigars , a human hub of old-style favor-trading . \u201c A bribe broker , \u201d Giuliani called him . \u201c A force to be reckoned with , \u201d his own attorney would grant in his memoir . And the perch from which Friedman presided was his office at the law firm of one of his closest associates , Roy Cohn , and one of his most prominent clients was Cohn \u2019 s most noted mentee\u2014Donald Trump .\nTrump wasn \u2019 t on trial but Giuliani didn \u2019 t do his reputation any favors . Giuliani sketched for the jury what he called this \u201c cesspool of corruption , \u201d this tale of \u201c plunder , \u201d this story of \u201c the buying and selling of public office. \u201d Knitting the men together , Giuiliani cast Trump as a preeminent beneficiary of Friedman \u2019 s expansive , crooked clout .\n\u201c During the latter part of time that you were deputy mayor , \u201d Giuliani posed , referring to Friedman \u2019 s official capacity in the late 1970s in the administration of Trump family friend Mayor Abe Beame , \u201c You had meetings with Roy Cohn and talked about joining his law firm , isn \u2019 t that correct ? \u201d\nFriedman concurred . \u201c When you leave government , if you are ever interested in coming with my firm , let \u2019 s talk , \u201d he said Cohn had told him\u2014part of an exchange inside a comparatively tiny portion of the 10-week trial that was mentioned briefly by the late investigative journalists Jack Newfield and Wayne Barrett in their 1988 book called City for Sale and then explored more deeply by Graham Kates of CBS News in the run-up to the election of 2016 .\n\u201c Isn \u2019 t it a fact that in your last week to 10 days in office , you signed for the very profitable deals with one of Roy Cohn \u2019 s major clients , Donald Trump\u2014multimillion-dollar deals ? \u201d Giuliani continued , alluding to the unprecedentedly extravagant tax break the barely 30-year-old developer had received to turn the old Commodore Hotel into the sleek Grand Hyatt that opened in 1980 and launched Trump \u2019 s career in Manhattan .\n\u201c What I did , \u201d Friedman responded , in a stroke of evasive doublespeak , \u201c was effectuating and concluding and consummating a five-year or three-year experience of Donald Trump with the city government . \u201d\nNow , going on 33 years later , Giuliani \u2019 s relationship to Trump is radically different . Giuliani and Trump stand shoulder to shoulder in the midst of the spiraling Ukraine scandal . As many struggle to explain Giuliani \u2019 s willingness to serve , without pay , as the president \u2019 s personal attorney and \u201c shadow foreign policy \u201d attach\u00e9 , the two often are characterized as old friends and allies . \u201c My friend for a long time , \u201d in the words of Trump , according to Jay Sekulow , another of his attorneys . It \u2019 s not quite that simple , though , say the New York politicos , former Giuliani aides , former Trump employees and biographers of both men I spoke to this week . It \u2019 s in fact more revealing than that .\nThe relationship , in the estimation of those who know them well , always has been a predominantly transactional one , a function of proximity , pragmatism and a kind of philosophical kinship . Starting in the \u2018 80s , they weren \u2019 t friends as much as self-created characters on the same bustling , spot-lit , tabloid-stoked stage , ferociously and transparently ambitious players in New York \u2019 s nexus of money , publicity and power . They crossed paths at the never-ending parade of fetes for peddlers of influence and boldface names , of which they were two of the boldest . Both of them vengeful and constitutionally untrusting , indefatigable and resolutely unapologetic , ideologically malleable but politically driven , they boasted showman sensibilities and a willingness to co-opt each other \u2019 s fame as their careers rose and fell . Each retained a residue of outer-borough resentment , Giuliani born in Brooklyn and raised on Long Island , Trump a product of a leafy , wealthy enclave past the last subway stop in Queens . They both seemed to see publicity as a sort of sustenance . They both had a taste for black-and-white , law-and-order rhetoric . They both wanted to be president . They attended each other \u2019 s third weddings .\nBut the intertwining of their fates began back in the somewhat adversarial context of that New Haven courtroom . Giuliani was 42 . Trump was 40 . The two of them were young , brash and just getting started , and Giuliani pressed forward on what Friedman had done for Trump at the tail end of 1977 , the strings he pulled in this swirl of spoils .\n\u201c And at the time , you knew that Donald Trump was a client of Roy Cohn ? \u201d\nLess than two weeks later , Friedman was found guilty on all counts . The trial heralded the end of an era of municipal malfeasance , and the moralistic , crusading Giuliani crowed . \u201c I don \u2019 t think there \u2019 s anybody much worse than a public official who sells his office , except maybe for a murderer , \u201d he told Vanity Fair . The limelight and the outcome fueled , too , Giuliani \u2019 s own political hopes . Friedman , a veteran pol who recognized an aspiring one , called it . \u201c I suggest when he throws his hat in the ring and when he announces his candidacy , \u201d he told reporters before he was sentenced to prison , \u201c I hope you say somewhere along the line that maybe Stanley Friedman was right . \u201d\nStanley Friedman was right . In the late '80s , Giuliani was at the cusp of his electoral ascendance , toying with a run for a seat in the United States Senate before setting his sights on City Hall , and Trump in his own manner was equally up-and-coming , spinning the chart-topping sales of The Art of the Deal into an especially manic and acquisitive stretch in which he ramped up his joking , but clearly not totally joking talk of gunning for the Oval Office . For most of the '90s , Giuliani , of course , was mayor of New York , while Trump had to scrap to stay solvent and mitigate reputational stain as he plotted his comeback . In the 2000s , though , they basked in the glow of unexpected boosts , the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , casting Giuliani as \u201c America \u2019 s Mayor \u201d and the early ratings bonanza and pop-culture reach of \u201c The Apprentice \u201d recasting Trump as a singularly successful business boss . Giuliani tried but couldn \u2019 t turn his burst into residence in the White House . Trump , needless to say , on that front did not fail .\nAnd now here they are , Trump and Giuliani , staring at the prospect of Trump \u2019 s impeachment before the new year . Trump recently started to distance himself from Giuliani , according to a former senior administration official , before being told that was a bad idea . Even as allies grow increasingly frustrated with Giuliani \u2019 s loose-lipped , on-air antics , cast-aside aides can turn into enemies , and that , the thinking goes , is the last thing this administration needs at this moment of heightening risk . \u201c I don \u2019 t think Trump has any choice now but to keep Giuliani close , \u201d the senior administration official said .\nThis , ironically , is almost certainly the closest they \u2019 ve ever been .\nIt \u2019 s fair to wonder why the workaholic Giuliani didn \u2019 t follow up on Trump \u2019 s part of the coalition of corruption he had laid out in court . He did . Sort of . In early 1988 , as Giuliani eyed his shift from prosecutor to politician , his righthand man visited Trump at Trump Tower .\n\u201c Trump , he \u2019 s a player , Giuliani \u2019 s a player , and you never know when he \u2019 ll become important to you. \u201d \u2014George Arzt , New York Democratic consultant\nTony Lombardi , a federal agent who worked directly for Giuliani , then still in the top spot at the SDNY , opened a quiet , informal investigation into a potentially fraudulent sale of a Trump Tower duplex to Robert Hopkins , the burly , mob-tied head of New York \u2019 s biggest gambling ring , according to the reporting of Wayne Barrett , who wrote about this in the Village Voice in October of 1993 and again in the New York Daily News in September of 2016 . The transaction had included a briefcase stuffed with $ 200,000 in cash and a loan from a New Jersey bank that had done business with Trump \u2019 s casinos . A Trump limo delivered the money to the bank . Trump himself had attended the closing . And Hopkins \u2019 mortgage broker , seeking leniency on an unrelated charge , was saying Trump had \u201c participated \u201d in money-laundering and was willing to wear a wire to help . But Lombardi\u2014who subsequently , albeit fleetingly , became friendly with Trump , and who died in 2015\u2014talked twice with Trump , decided Trump had \u201c answered all my questions , \u201d and closed the probe before it even got a case number .\nThis , Barrett suggested in the Voice , \u201c may \u2026 have helped create a political alliance. \u201d ( Giuliani didn \u2019 t respond to my requests for comment . Neither did the White House . )\nThe following year , Trump gave $ 3,000 to Giuliani in his bid to become mayor , even co-chairing a fundraiser at the Waldorf Astoria . He also , though , gave $ 2,250 to Giuliani \u2019 s opponent , David Dinkins , the Democrat who went on to win . More than anything , it seemed , Trump simply wanted somebody to knock off his uppermost nemesis , three-term Mayor Ed Koch . Furthermore , and aside from any whiff of impropriety , doling out dollars to politicians and would-be politicians was just \u2026 what Trump did . For Dinkins . For Giuliani . For anybody and practically everybody . Giving money to Giuliani ? Par for the course . It would have been unusual if he hadn \u2019 t .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t remember him having a stronger relationship with Giuliani , \u201d former Trump Organization executive Louise Sunshine told me . \u201c Donald Trump had a relationship with every politician . \u201d\n\u201c That was always his political philosophy\u2014you know , support everybody , \u201d added Jack O \u2019 Donnell , a former Trump casino executive , \u201c because you \u2019 re going to be asking whoever it is for favors . \u201d\n\u201c Trump , he \u2019 s a player , Giuliani \u2019 s a player , and you never know when he \u2019 ll become important to you , \u201d longtime New York Democratic consultant and former Koch aide George Arzt explained . \u201c This was the Roy Cohn technique to try to get close to powerful people . And for Rudy Giuliani , he \u2019 s got to get his money somewhere . \u201d\nTrump , in fact , had started talking about giving money to Giuliani as early as 1987 . \u201c If Rudy decides to run for public office , I hold Rudy in very high esteem , and I would love to be helpful to Rudy , \u201d he told the Washington Post at the time . \u201c Rudy is a man who has tremendous talents. \u201d Giuliani declared himself \u201c flattered . \u201d\n\u201c Close ? \u201d Arzt said . \u201c You know , in politics , you don \u2019 t have to be close . You just have to know the person . \u201d\nAnd they knew each other . Broadly speaking , they were part of the same crowd\u2014the people , the personalities , really , who tended to show up the most in the gossip pages of the Daily News and Newsday and the New York Post and New York magazine .\n\u201c Trump was the kind of guy you gave a couple of parking passes to . It wasn \u2019 t , like , \u2018 Hey , we got ta take care of Donald. \u2019 \u201d \u2014Rick Wilson , Republican consultant\n\u201c Tabloid icons , \u201d Giuliani biographer Andrew Kirtzman said . \u201c Rudy Giuliani , George Steinbrenner , Donald Trump , and Al Sharpton , and Ed Koch \u2026 they were in a very tight club , and there was probably a mutual admiration among them as well as competition . \u2026 They worked the media , impeccably , all of them , and they were in a club , you know , going back to the 1980s . \u201d\nIn 1988 , for example , Giuliani and Trump were dubbed by New York as two of the 20 most important New Yorkers . They gathered for a gala at the Cloud Club atop the Chrysler Building with some of the rest of the picks and a diverse crowd of VIPs including Koch , Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan , Rupert Murdoch , Malcolm Forbes , Arianna Huffington and Gay Talese .\nIn the issue of the magazine featuring the accounting of this top 20 , author Peter Maas wrote about Giuliani , and gossip columnist Liz Smith wrote about Trump .\n\u201c I can \u2019 t resist a man who calls me \u2018 Honeybun , \u2019 \u201d Smith said in a cheeky , contrarian take , ending with a prediction . \u201c I figure that someday I \u2019 ll hear that when I \u2019 m standing in the White House receiving line . \u201d\nMeanwhile , Maas wrapped with this : \u201c \u2026 as a general rule , said Giuliani , anybody in a sensitive public post who has been the subject of endless allegations of malfeasance ought to step down forthwith . \u201d\nIn 1993 , Giuliani beat Dinkins in a rematch\u2014no thanks , though , to Trump , who had given $ 5,500 to Dinkins \u2019 reelection effort and nothing to Giuliani . In 1994 , though , after Giuliani took over , Trump ponied up $ 5,000 . In subsequent years , he chipped in an additional $ 2,700 . For much of Giuliani \u2019 s two-term helm , though , his relationship with Trump , such as it was , was pretty much \u2026 meh .\n\u201c He was not a fixture in the orbit . He was not somebody that , you know , you had to do things for , \u201d a former Giuliani aide told me . \u201c He just wasn \u2019 t part of the every day . He just wasn \u2019 t . He wasn \u2019 t disliked . He was someone you \u2019 d see at events from time to time , and the mayor would always go over and say hi to him and stuff\u2014but these guys weren \u2019 t out drinking and having dinner and buddying around . \u201d\n\u201c There was never a lot of love for Donald Trump . He was one of those characters in that pantheon of New York figures who was inevitably going to be around , but I can \u2019 t recall anybody ever , like , raising , \u2018 Oh , my God , Donald Trump \u2019 s central to our victory , \u2019 \u201d said Republican consultant Rick Wilson , who is one of the more vociferous Trump critics now but was on Giuliani \u2019 s staff back then .\n\u201c Trump , \u201d Wilson said , \u201c was the kind of guy you gave a couple of parking passes to . It wasn \u2019 t , like , \u2018 Hey , we got ta take care of Donald . \u2019 \u201d\n\u201c I covered Giuliani on a daily basis for his entire mayoralty , \u201d said Kirtzman , the biographer who was a reporter for the local cable news network NY1 , \u201c and I don \u2019 t recall many interactions with Trump . I do not remember them having spent a lot of time together . \u201d\nBut once Trump was back largely on more solid fiscal ground , past his most perilous financial straits of the early to mid-1990s , he lobbed public praise at Giuliani . \u201c Rudy Giuliani has done an amazing job as the mayor of New York , helping to make the city a hot place\u2014again , \u201d he wrote in his book titled The Art of the Comeback , which came out in 1997 , the same year Giuliani was reelected .\nIn 1999 , when Giuliani launched an ultimately ill-fated Senate campaign , Trump gave him $ 2,000\u2014 $ 1,000 in January , another $ 1,000 in April .\nThat June , at 93 , Trump \u2019 s father died . At Fred Trump \u2019 s funeral , at Norman Vincent Peale \u2019 s Marble Collegiate Church on Fifth Avenue , Giuliani spoke . The mayor called Trump \u2019 s father \u201c a giant. \u201d Trump \u2019 s father , Giuliani told the more than 800 movers and shakers and mourners , according to the New York Post , \u201c not only helped to build our city , but helped define it. \u201d He said he had helped make New York \u201c the most important city in the world . \u201d\nA little more than three months later , as Trump mounted a Roger Stone-orchestrated test of a presidential run as a Reform Party candidate , he went on Larry King \u2019 s show on CNN to talk about it\u2014and also used the slot to laud Giuliani , who at the time was preparing to take on Hillary Clinton in a highly anticipated Senate race . Giuliani , Trump told King , \u201c has been the best mayor in the history of the city of New York . \u201d\n\u201c I like her very much , \u201d Trump responded , \u201c but I think Rudy\u2014and as I said before , he \u2019 s been the great mayor in the history of the city of New York . This city is the hottest place in the world , and \u2026I \u2019 m so honored to be doing so well and to be the biggest developer in the city . But he really helped the city , and he \u2019 s been a great mayor . And people\u2014maybe some people\u2014don \u2019 t like him and some people love him totally . I happen to be in love \u2026 \u201d\n\u201c If you \u2019 re on the Reform Party ballot in New York , \u201d King said to Trump , \u201c you would publicly endorse Giuliani ? \u201d\nTrump abandoned his run after a few months , and Giuliani \u2019 s fizzled , too , and so both of them at the start of the new century were searching for what was next . In the meantime , they teamed up for a skit at the \u201c Inner Circle , \u201d an annual chummy , clubby convening of New York \u2019 s political figures and members of the press . In the video , Giuliani , wearing a blonde wig , crimson lipstick and a billowy lavender dress with matching high heels , sashays through a department store toward Trump , who \u2019 s dressed \u2026 the way he \u2019 s always dressed . \u201c You know , you \u2019 re really beautiful , \u201d Trump says to \u201c Rudia. \u201d Approximately 20 seconds later , Trump plunges his face into the mayor \u2019 s fake breasts . \u201c Rudia \u201d calls Trump \u201c a dirty boy \u201d and smacks him . \u201c Can \u2019 t say I didn \u2019 t try , \u201d says a smirking Trump\u2014the punchline of a gag that sits of course in an utterly different context today .\nFor some observers , the takeaway was clear : For a little attention , the two of them would do just about anything .\n\u201c Trump put himself wherever he could to get his name in the paper , \u201d former New York Congressman Charlie Rangel told me this week . Ditto Giuliani . \u201c When people know that other people are going to get publicity , both Giuliani and Trump would be attracted to being there . \u201d\nPeak Rudy was the wake of the terror of September 11 , 2001 . People called him \u201c America \u2019 s Mayor. \u201d Time called him the \u201c Mayor of the World , \u201d and the Person of the Year . The Queen of England knighted him .\nTrump , meanwhile , was \u2026 not . He was still two-plus years from his life-altering role on reality TV . In 2003 , Giuliani invited him to his third wedding , along with Henry Kissinger , Barbara Walters and Yogi Berra .\nA year and a half later , though , as Giuliani mostly bided time until he started running for president in 2007\u2014he thought he might have been in a position to run in 2004 had Al Gore beaten George W. Bush in 2000\u2014Trump found himself , somewhat shockingly , newly ascendant , and all of a sudden ubiquitous , and he tossed Giuliani a cameo in the second season of \u201c The Apprentice , \u201d when the program was near its most popular point . In the fourth of the 14 episodes that season , which aired in late September , the winners of that show \u2019 s contest got to meet with Giuliani\u2014 \u201c one of the greatest leaders in the country , \u201d Trump told them . Giuliani was that week \u2019 s reward .\n\u201c Their prize was a great one : They would get to go over to Rudy Giuliani \u2019 s new office at Times Square and have a discussion with the man himself , \u201d Trump said in one of the books he had pumped out that year , Think Like a Billionaire . \u201c We arrived at Rudy \u2019 s offices high above Times Square , an area that is now thriving due to Rudy \u2019 s vigilance and foresight , and we were met by Rudy and his lively wife , Judith . I made a brief introduction and then left the rest to Rudy . \u201d\nTrue enough . \u201c Trump was there for about , I \u2019 m not kidding you , five minutes , maybe , \u201d a Giuliani aide who was there told me . \u201c He came in , met him at the lobby , he brought the cast up with the cameras , and then he walked out and Rudy spent time with the people . \u201d\nGiuliani , Trump recalled in the book , spent \u201c over an hour \u201d giving them a tour of his office . He showed them a sign on his desk . \u201c I \u2019 M RESPONSIBLE , \u201d it read .\n\u201c The most important principle of leadership is knowing what you believe , \u201d he told them . \u201c Because when you \u2019 re in a crisis , you have got to know what \u2019 s really important to you . \u201d\n\u201c One of the great men of our time , \u201d Trump concluded .\nThe following year , Trump invited Giuliani to his third wedding , in Palm Beach , Florida , a lavish , even more eclectic affair , the guest list running the gamut from Katie Couric and Matt Lauer to Simon Cowell and Shaquille O \u2019 Neal to Chris Christie and Bill and Hillary Clinton .\nFast forward a couple years . As \u201c Apprentice \u201d ratings started to sag for Trump , Giuliani spent most of 2007 as the frontrunner in the Republican presidential primary . Trump backed him , although he still split the difference the way he had with his donations in that first mayoral race almost two decades before , giving as well to Hillary Clinton in her Democratic bid .\n\u201c Mr . Trump , \u201d he was asked in a \u201c frequently asked questions \u201d section in that year \u2019 s Think Big and Kick Ass : In Business and In Life , \u201c since you are not running for president , who do we support and how do we get started ? \u201d\n\u201c You have a lot of good people , \u201d Trump said . \u201c Rudy Giuliani is a very good person . Hillary Clinton is a very good person . \u201d\nGiuliani \u2019 s lead in the polls didn \u2019 t last . ( Joe Biden , of all people , in a Democratic debate , landed the most memorable criticism of Giuliani \u2019 s candidacy : \u201c There \u2019 s only three things he mentions in a sentence\u2014a noun , a verb and 9/11. \u201d ) Giuliani \u2019 s bid nosedived once voters started voting . He didn \u2019 t even make it to February of 2008 , as he dropped out and endorsed John McCain .\nThe tables turned yet again , with Giuliani flirting with a run for governor of New York in 2010 and contemplating another run for president but acknowledging that \u201c it \u2019 s too late for me \u201d while Trump just kept attracting more and more political attention with his \u201c birtherism \u201d falsehoods about Barack Obama . Giuliani tried to tamp down such talk .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not one who wants to raise that question , \u201d he told the Washington Times in the spring of 2011 . \u201c It \u2019 s been proven to my satisfaction that the president was born in the United States . \u201d\n\u201c Rudy wanted to be relevant again and Trump gave him that platform. \u201d \u2014A former aide\n\u201c I think he is doing as well as he \u2019 s doing , \u201d Giuliani said , referring to some polls suggesting GOP primary voters preferred the race-baiting conspiracy theorist from \u201c The Apprentice , \u201d \u201c because he \u2019 s saying things the American people need to hear\u2014about leadership and about strength and about being proud of America and not apologizing for America . So I think he \u2019 s resonating . \u201d\nBy early 2015 , Giuliani \u2019 s rhetoric about the 44th president had grown far more harsh\u2014more along the lines of what people had grown accustomed to from Trump .\n\u201c I do not believe that the president loves America , \u201d he said at a private dinner at New York \u2019 s 21 Club . \u201c He doesn \u2019 t love you . And he doesn \u2019 t love me . He wasn \u2019 t brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up through love of this country . \u201d\nEven so , as Trump prepped for his real run for the White House , Giuliani was hardly top of mind at Trump Tower .\n\u201c Never heard him talk about him , \u201d said Sam Nunberg , Trump \u2019 s most active , day-to-day political aide at the time .\nShortly after launching his candidacy for the Republican nomination for president in 2015 , Trump talks with Giuliani at a fundraising event in the Bronx . | AP Photo/Seth Wenig\nAnd it \u2019 s not like Giuliani jumped at the chance to back Trump right when he came down that escalator .\nOnce he was in , though , he was \u2026 all in .\nGiuliani was , in the words of campaign brass Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie , a \u201c super surrogate. \u201d He introduced Trump at rallies . He gave a thunderous speech on his behalf at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland . He was involved in debate prep . And he was by far the most willing Trump defender on the Sunday shows following the leak of the \u201c Access Hollywood \u201d tape of Trump saying he could grab women \u201c by the pussy . \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 ll do all of them , \u201d Giuliani offered . \u201c I \u2019 ll do every Sunday show . \u201d\n\u201c Men at times talk like that , \u201d he said on CNN .\n\u201c Locker room talk , \u201d he said days later at a rally , parroting Trump .\n\u201c Rudy wanted to be relevant again , \u201d a former aide told me . \u201c And Trump gave him that platform . \u201d\n\u201c I didn \u2019 t find it curious when all of a sudden there was Rudy as a Trump supporter , \u201d former Manhattan borough president Ruth Messinger said when we talked this week , \u201c because he \u2019 s interested in power .

    "content_original": "Michael Kruse is a senior staff writer for POLITICO.\n\nLong, long before he was Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney and devoted defender, Rudy Giuliani wasn\u2019t exactly a fan. The first time, actually, he invoked Trump\u2019s name in a high-profile, high-stakes setting, Giuliani was the prosecutor in a public corruption case.\n\nThe setting was the federal courthouse in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1986. Giuliani was the top gun from the Southern District of New York. And the main defendant, accused of taking kickbacks from companies for whom he helped score contracts with the city\u2019s Parking Violations Bureau, was Stanley Friedman\u2014a former deputy mayor, the Democratic Party chair in the Bronx and a lobbyist who the year before had netted nearly a million dollars. He typically sported a goatee, pinstriped suits with a pocket square and glasses with his initials in rhinestones. He spent his days on the phone, chain-chomping cigars, a human hub of old-style favor-trading. \u201cA bribe broker,\u201d Giuliani called him. \u201cA force to be reckoned with,\u201d his own attorney would grant in his memoir. And the perch from which Friedman presided was his office at the law firm of one of his closest associates, Roy Cohn, and one of his most prominent clients was Cohn\u2019s most noted mentee\u2014Donald Trump.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTrump wasn\u2019t on trial but Giuliani didn\u2019t do his reputation any favors. Giuliani sketched for the jury what he called this \u201ccesspool of corruption,\u201d this tale of \u201cplunder,\u201d this story of \u201cthe buying and selling of public office.\u201d Knitting the men together, Giuiliani cast Trump as a preeminent beneficiary of Friedman\u2019s expansive, crooked clout.\n\n\u201cDuring the latter part of time that you were deputy mayor,\u201d Giuliani posed, referring to Friedman\u2019s official capacity in the late 1970s in the administration of Trump family friend Mayor Abe Beame, \u201cYou had meetings with Roy Cohn and talked about joining his law firm, isn\u2019t that correct?\u201d\n\nOver 30 years ago, when he was a U.S. Attorney prosecuting a corruption case against an associate of Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer Roy Cohn, Rudy Giuliani (left) first uttered the name of the future president (right, also in 1986) in a high-profile, public setting. | Robin Graubard/NY Daily News via Getty Images; AP Photo/Robin Graubard\n\nFriedman concurred. \u201cWhen you leave government, if you are ever interested in coming with my firm, let\u2019s talk,\u201d he said Cohn had told him\u2014part of an exchange inside a comparatively tiny portion of the 10-week trial that was mentioned briefly by the late investigative journalists Jack Newfield and Wayne Barrett in their 1988 book called City for Sale and then explored more deeply by Graham Kates of CBS News in the run-up to the election of 2016.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it a fact that in your last week to 10 days in office, you signed for the very profitable deals with one of Roy Cohn\u2019s major clients, Donald Trump\u2014multimillion-dollar deals?\u201d Giuliani continued, alluding to the unprecedentedly extravagant tax break the barely 30-year-old developer had received to turn the old Commodore Hotel into the sleek Grand Hyatt that opened in 1980 and launched Trump\u2019s career in Manhattan.\n\n\u201cWhat I did,\u201d Friedman responded, in a stroke of evasive doublespeak, \u201cwas effectuating and concluding and consummating a five-year or three-year experience of Donald Trump with the city government.\u201d\n\nNow, going on 33 years later, Giuliani\u2019s relationship to Trump is radically different. Giuliani and Trump stand shoulder to shoulder in the midst of the spiraling Ukraine scandal. As many struggle to explain Giuliani\u2019s willingness to serve, without pay, as the president\u2019s personal attorney and \u201cshadow foreign policy\u201d attach\u00e9, the two often are characterized as old friends and allies. \u201cMy friend for a long time,\u201d in the words of Trump, according to Jay Sekulow, another of his attorneys. It\u2019s not quite that simple, though, say the New York politicos, former Giuliani aides, former Trump employees and biographers of both men I spoke to this week. It\u2019s in fact more revealing than that.\n\nThe relationship, in the estimation of those who know them well, always has been a predominantly transactional one, a function of proximity, pragmatism and a kind of philosophical kinship. Starting in the \u201880s, they weren\u2019t friends as much as self-created characters on the same bustling, spot-lit, tabloid-stoked stage, ferociously and transparently ambitious players in New York\u2019s nexus of money, publicity and power. They crossed paths at the never-ending parade of fetes for peddlers of influence and boldface names, of which they were two of the boldest. Both of them vengeful and constitutionally untrusting, indefatigable and resolutely unapologetic, ideologically malleable but politically driven, they boasted showman sensibilities and a willingness to co-opt each other\u2019s fame as their careers rose and fell. Each retained a residue of outer-borough resentment, Giuliani born in Brooklyn and raised on Long Island, Trump a product of a leafy, wealthy enclave past the last subway stop in Queens. They both seemed to see publicity as a sort of sustenance. They both had a taste for black-and-white, law-and-order rhetoric. They both wanted to be president. They attended each other\u2019s third weddings.\n\nBut the intertwining of their fates began back in the somewhat adversarial context of that New Haven courtroom. Giuliani was 42. Trump was 40. The two of them were young, brash and just getting started, and Giuliani pressed forward on what Friedman had done for Trump at the tail end of 1977, the strings he pulled in this swirl of spoils.\n\n\u201cAnd at the time, you knew that Donald Trump was a client of Roy Cohn?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I did.\u201d\n\nLess than two weeks later, Friedman was found guilty on all counts. The trial heralded the end of an era of municipal malfeasance, and the moralistic, crusading Giuliani crowed. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody much worse than a public official who sells his office, except maybe for a murderer,\u201d he told Vanity Fair. The limelight and the outcome fueled, too, Giuliani\u2019s own political hopes. Friedman, a veteran pol who recognized an aspiring one, called it. \u201cI suggest when he throws his hat in the ring and when he announces his candidacy,\u201d he told reporters before he was sentenced to prison, \u201cI hope you say somewhere along the line that maybe Stanley Friedman was right.\u201d\n\nThen-New York Mayor Giuliani posing with Trump at the groundbreaking of the Trump International Hotel and Tower in 1995. | Rose Hartman/Getty Images\n\nStanley Friedman was right. In the late '80s, Giuliani was at the cusp of his electoral ascendance, toying with a run for a seat in the United States Senate before setting his sights on City Hall, and Trump in his own manner was equally up-and-coming, spinning the chart-topping sales of The Art of the Deal into an especially manic and acquisitive stretch in which he ramped up his joking, but clearly not totally joking talk of gunning for the Oval Office. For most of the '90s, Giuliani, of course, was mayor of New York, while Trump had to scrap to stay solvent and mitigate reputational stain as he plotted his comeback. In the 2000s, though, they basked in the glow of unexpected boosts, the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, casting Giuliani as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Mayor\u201d and the early ratings bonanza and pop-culture reach of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d recasting Trump as a singularly successful business boss. Giuliani tried but couldn\u2019t turn his burst into residence in the White House. Trump, needless to say, on that front did not fail.\n\nAnd now here they are, Trump and Giuliani, staring at the prospect of Trump\u2019s impeachment before the new year. Trump recently started to distance himself from Giuliani, according to a former senior administration official, before being told that was a bad idea. Even as allies grow increasingly frustrated with Giuliani\u2019s loose-lipped, on-air antics, cast-aside aides can turn into enemies, and that, the thinking goes, is the last thing this administration needs at this moment of heightening risk. \u201cI don\u2019t think Trump has any choice now but to keep Giuliani close,\u201d the senior administration official said.\n\nThis, ironically, is almost certainly the closest they\u2019ve ever been.\n\n\n\n***\n\nIt\u2019s fair to wonder why the workaholic Giuliani didn\u2019t follow up on Trump\u2019s part of the coalition of corruption he had laid out in court. He did. Sort of. In early 1988, as Giuliani eyed his shift from prosecutor to politician, his righthand man visited Trump at Trump Tower.\n\n\u201cTrump, he\u2019s a player, Giuliani\u2019s a player, and you never know when he\u2019ll become important to you.\u201d \u2014George Arzt, New York Democratic consultant\n\nTony Lombardi, a federal agent who worked directly for Giuliani, then still in the top spot at the SDNY, opened a quiet, informal investigation into a potentially fraudulent sale of a Trump Tower duplex to Robert Hopkins, the burly, mob-tied head of New York\u2019s biggest gambling ring, according to the reporting of Wayne Barrett, who wrote about this in the Village Voice in October of 1993 and again in the New York Daily News in September of 2016. The transaction had included a briefcase stuffed with $200,000 in cash and a loan from a New Jersey bank that had done business with Trump\u2019s casinos. A Trump limo delivered the money to the bank. Trump himself had attended the closing. And Hopkins\u2019 mortgage broker, seeking leniency on an unrelated charge, was saying Trump had \u201cparticipated\u201d in money-laundering and was willing to wear a wire to help. But Lombardi\u2014who subsequently, albeit fleetingly, became friendly with Trump, and who died in 2015\u2014talked twice with Trump, decided Trump had \u201canswered all my questions,\u201d and closed the probe before it even got a case number.\n\nThis, Barrett suggested in the Voice, \u201cmay \u2026 have helped create a political alliance.\u201d (Giuliani didn\u2019t respond to my requests for comment. Neither did the White House.)\n\nThe following year, Trump gave $3,000 to Giuliani in his bid to become mayor, even co-chairing a fundraiser at the Waldorf Astoria. He also, though, gave $2,250 to Giuliani\u2019s opponent, David Dinkins, the Democrat who went on to win. More than anything, it seemed, Trump simply wanted somebody to knock off his uppermost nemesis, three-term Mayor Ed Koch. Furthermore, and aside from any whiff of impropriety, doling out dollars to politicians and would-be politicians was just \u2026 what Trump did. For Dinkins. For Giuliani. For anybody and practically everybody. Giving money to Giuliani? Par for the course. It would have been unusual if he hadn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember him having a stronger relationship with Giuliani,\u201d former Trump Organization executive Louise Sunshine told me. \u201cDonald Trump had a relationship with every politician.\u201d\n\nIn May 1999, Giuliani and Trump came together for a news conference announcing a new morning news show to be hosted by Bryant Gumbel and broadcast from the General Motors Building at Trump International Plaza. Later that same year, the two led the annual German-American Steuben Parade on Fifth Ave. | Andrew Savulich/NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images; Evy Mages/NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images\n\n\u201cThat was always his political philosophy\u2014you know, support everybody,\u201d added Jack O\u2019Donnell, a former Trump casino executive, \u201cbecause you\u2019re going to be asking whoever it is for favors.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump, he\u2019s a player, Giuliani\u2019s a player, and you never know when he\u2019ll become important to you,\u201d longtime New York Democratic consultant and former Koch aide George Arzt explained. \u201cThis was the Roy Cohn technique to try to get close to powerful people. And for Rudy Giuliani, he\u2019s got to get his money somewhere.\u201d\n\nTrump, in fact, had started talking about giving money to Giuliani as early as 1987. \u201cIf Rudy decides to run for public office, I hold Rudy in very high esteem, and I would love to be helpful to Rudy,\u201d he told the Washington Post at the time. \u201cRudy is a man who has tremendous talents.\u201d Giuliani declared himself \u201cflattered.\u201d\n\nBut were they close?\n\n\u201cClose?\u201d Arzt said. \u201cYou know, in politics, you don\u2019t have to be close. You just have to know the person.\u201d\n\nAnd they knew each other. Broadly speaking, they were part of the same crowd\u2014the people, the personalities, really, who tended to show up the most in the gossip pages of the Daily News and Newsday and the New York Post and New York magazine.\n\n\u201cCharacters of a type,\u201d Trump biographer Michael D\u2019Antonio said.\n\n\u201cTrump was the kind of guy you gave a couple of parking passes to. It wasn\u2019t, like, \u2018Hey, we gotta take care of Donald.\u2019\u201d \u2014Rick Wilson, Republican consultant\n\n\u201cTabloid icons,\u201d Giuliani biographer Andrew Kirtzman said. \u201cRudy Giuliani, George Steinbrenner, Donald Trump, and Al Sharpton, and Ed Koch \u2026 they were in a very tight club, and there was probably a mutual admiration among them as well as competition. \u2026 They worked the media, impeccably, all of them, and they were in a club, you know, going back to the 1980s.\u201d\n\nIn 1988, for example, Giuliani and Trump were dubbed by New York as two of the 20 most important New Yorkers. They gathered for a gala at the Cloud Club atop the Chrysler Building with some of the rest of the picks and a diverse crowd of VIPs including Koch, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Rupert Murdoch, Malcolm Forbes, Arianna Huffington and Gay Talese.\n\nIn the issue of the magazine featuring the accounting of this top 20, author Peter Maas wrote about Giuliani, and gossip columnist Liz Smith wrote about Trump.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t resist a man who calls me \u2018Honeybun,\u2019\u201d Smith said in a cheeky, contrarian take, ending with a prediction. \u201cI figure that someday I\u2019ll hear that when I\u2019m standing in the White House receiving line.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Maas wrapped with this: \u201c\u2026 as a general rule, said Giuliani, anybody in a sensitive public post who has been the subject of endless allegations of malfeasance ought to step down forthwith.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nIn 1993, Giuliani beat Dinkins in a rematch\u2014no thanks, though, to Trump, who had given $5,500 to Dinkins\u2019 reelection effort and nothing to Giuliani. In 1994, though, after Giuliani took over, Trump ponied up $5,000. In subsequent years, he chipped in an additional $2,700. For much of Giuliani\u2019s two-term helm, though, his relationship with Trump, such as it was, was pretty much \u2026 meh.\n\n\u201cHe was not a fixture in the orbit. He was not somebody that, you know, you had to do things for,\u201d a former Giuliani aide told me. \u201cHe just wasn\u2019t part of the every day. He just wasn\u2019t. He wasn\u2019t disliked. He was someone you\u2019d see at events from time to time, and the mayor would always go over and say hi to him and stuff\u2014but these guys weren\u2019t out drinking and having dinner and buddying around.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was never a lot of love for Donald Trump. He was one of those characters in that pantheon of New York figures who was inevitably going to be around, but I can\u2019t recall anybody ever, like, raising, \u2018Oh, my God, Donald Trump\u2019s central to our victory,\u2019\u201d said Republican consultant Rick Wilson, who is one of the more vociferous Trump critics now but was on Giuliani\u2019s staff back then.\n\n\u201cTrump,\u201d Wilson said, \u201cwas the kind of guy you gave a couple of parking passes to. It wasn\u2019t, like, \u2018Hey, we gotta take care of Donald.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI covered Giuliani on a daily basis for his entire mayoralty,\u201d said Kirtzman, the biographer who was a reporter for the local cable news network NY1, \u201cand I don\u2019t recall many interactions with Trump. I do not remember them having spent a lot of time together.\u201d\n\nBut once Trump was back largely on more solid fiscal ground, past his most perilous financial straits of the early to mid-1990s, he lobbed public praise at Giuliani. \u201cRudy Giuliani has done an amazing job as the mayor of New York, helping to make the city a hot place\u2014again,\u201d he wrote in his book titled The Art of the Comeback, which came out in 1997, the same year Giuliani was reelected.\n\nIn 1999, when Giuliani launched an ultimately ill-fated Senate campaign, Trump gave him $2,000\u2014$1,000 in January, another $1,000 in April.\n\nThat June, at 93, Trump\u2019s father died. At Fred Trump\u2019s funeral, at Norman Vincent Peale\u2019s Marble Collegiate Church on Fifth Avenue, Giuliani spoke. The mayor called Trump\u2019s father \u201ca giant.\u201d Trump\u2019s father, Giuliani told the more than 800 movers and shakers and mourners, according to the New York Post, \u201cnot only helped to build our city, but helped define it.\u201d He said he had helped make New York \u201cthe most important city in the world.\u201d\n\nA little more than three months later, as Trump mounted a Roger Stone-orchestrated test of a presidential run as a Reform Party candidate, he went on Larry King\u2019s show on CNN to talk about it\u2014and also used the slot to laud Giuliani, who at the time was preparing to take on Hillary Clinton in a highly anticipated Senate race. Giuliani, Trump told King, \u201chas been the best mayor in the history of the city of New York.\u201d\n\nKing asked Trump about Clinton.\n\n\u201cI like her very much,\u201d Trump responded, \u201cbut I think Rudy\u2014and as I said before, he\u2019s been the great mayor in the history of the city of New York. This city is the hottest place in the world, and \u2026I\u2019m so honored to be doing so well and to be the biggest developer in the city. But he really helped the city, and he\u2019s been a great mayor. And people\u2014maybe some people\u2014don\u2019t like him and some people love him totally. I happen to be in love \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re on the Reform Party ballot in New York,\u201d King said to Trump, \u201cyou would publicly endorse Giuliani?\u201d\n\nHere, though, Trump wouldn\u2019t, or didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the best,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump abandoned his run after a few months, and Giuliani\u2019s fizzled, too, and so both of them at the start of the new century were searching for what was next. In the meantime, they teamed up for a skit at the \u201cInner Circle,\u201d an annual chummy, clubby convening of New York\u2019s political figures and members of the press. In the video, Giuliani, wearing a blonde wig, crimson lipstick and a billowy lavender dress with matching high heels, sashays through a department store toward Trump, who\u2019s dressed \u2026 the way he\u2019s always dressed. \u201cYou know, you\u2019re really beautiful,\u201d Trump says to \u201cRudia.\u201d Approximately 20 seconds later, Trump plunges his face into the mayor\u2019s fake breasts. \u201cRudia\u201d calls Trump \u201ca dirty boy\u201d and smacks him. \u201cCan\u2019t say I didn\u2019t try,\u201d says a smirking Trump\u2014the punchline of a gag that sits of course in an utterly different context today.\n\nFor some observers, the takeaway was clear: For a little attention, the two of them would do just about anything.\n\n\u201cTrump put himself wherever he could to get his name in the paper,\u201d former New York Congressman Charlie Rangel told me this week. Ditto Giuliani. \u201cWhen people know that other people are going to get publicity, both Giuliani and Trump would be attracted to being there.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nPeak Rudy was the wake of the terror of September 11, 2001. People called him \u201cAmerica\u2019s Mayor.\u201d Time called him the \u201cMayor of the World,\u201d and the Person of the Year. The Queen of England knighted him.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, was \u2026 not. He was still two-plus years from his life-altering role on reality TV. In 2003, Giuliani invited him to his third wedding, along with Henry Kissinger, Barbara Walters and Yogi Berra.\n\nTop: Then-New York Governor George Pataki (left), Mayor Giuliani (center) and Senator Hillary Clinton (right) tour the site of the destruction of the World Trade Center the day after 9/11.

Bukaty; Amanda Edwards/Getty Images\n\nA year and a half later, though, as Giuliani mostly bided time until he started running for president in 2007\u2014he thought he might have been in a position to run in 2004 had Al Gore beaten George W. Bush in 2000\u2014Trump found himself, somewhat shockingly, newly ascendant, and all of a sudden ubiquitous, and he tossed Giuliani a cameo in the second season of \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d when the program was near its most popular point. In the fourth of the 14 episodes that season, which aired in late September, the winners of that show\u2019s contest got to meet with Giuliani\u2014\u201cone of the greatest leaders in the country,\u201d Trump told them. Giuliani was that week\u2019s reward.\n\n\u201cTheir prize was a great one: They would get to go over to Rudy Giuliani\u2019s new office at Times Square and have a discussion with the man himself,\u201d Trump said in one of the books he had pumped out that year, Think Like a Billionaire. \u201cWe arrived at Rudy\u2019s offices high above Times Square, an area that is now thriving due to Rudy\u2019s vigilance and foresight, and we were met by Rudy and his lively wife, Judith. I made a brief introduction and then left the rest to Rudy.\u201d\n\nTrue enough. \u201cTrump was there for about, I\u2019m not kidding you, five minutes, maybe,\u201d a Giuliani aide who was there told me. \u201cHe came in, met him at the lobby, he brought the cast up with the cameras, and then he walked out and Rudy spent time with the people.\u201d\n\nGiuliani, Trump recalled in the book, spent \u201cover an hour\u201d giving them a tour of his office. He showed them a sign on his desk. \u201cI\u2019M RESPONSIBLE,\u201d it read.\n\n\u201cThe most important principle of leadership is knowing what you believe,\u201d he told them. \u201cBecause when you\u2019re in a crisis, you have got to know what\u2019s really important to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the great men of our time,\u201d Trump concluded.\n\nThe following year, Trump invited Giuliani to his third wedding, in Palm Beach, Florida, a lavish, even more eclectic affair, the guest list running the gamut from Katie Couric and Matt Lauer to Simon Cowell and Shaquille O\u2019Neal to Chris Christie and Bill and Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump and then-girlfriend Melania Knauss (top left) attend Giuliani\u2019s 2003 wedding to his third wife Judith Nathan in New York City, and Giuliani and Nathan (top right) later attend Trump\u2019s wedding to third wife Knauss in 2005 in Palm Beach, Florida.

As \u201cApprentice\u201d ratings started to sag for Trump, Giuliani spent most of 2007 as the frontrunner in the Republican presidential primary. Trump backed him, although he still split the difference the way he had with his donations in that first mayoral race almost two decades before, giving as well to Hillary Clinton in her Democratic bid.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump,\u201d he was asked in a \u201cfrequently asked questions\u201d section in that year\u2019s Think Big and Kick Ass: In Business and In Life, \u201csince you are not running for president, who do we support and how do we get started?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have a lot of good people,\u201d Trump said. \u201cRudy Giuliani is a very good person. Hillary Clinton is a very good person.\u201d\n\nGiuliani\u2019s lead in the polls didn\u2019t last. (Joe Biden, of all people, in a Democratic debate, landed the most memorable criticism of Giuliani\u2019s candidacy: \u201cThere\u2019s only three things he mentions in a sentence\u2014a noun, a verb and 9/11.\u201d) Giuliani\u2019s bid nosedived once voters started voting. He didn\u2019t even make it to February of 2008, as he dropped out and endorsed John McCain.\n\nThe tables turned yet again, with Giuliani flirting with a run for governor of New York in 2010 and contemplating another run for president but acknowledging that \u201cit\u2019s too late for me\u201d while Trump just kept attracting more and more political attention with his \u201cbirtherism\u201d falsehoods about Barack Obama. Giuliani tried to tamp down such talk.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not one who wants to raise that question,\u201d he told the Washington Times in the spring of 2011. \u201cIt\u2019s been proven to my satisfaction that the president was born in the United States.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, though, he talked up Trump.\n\n\u201cRudy wanted to be relevant again and Trump gave him that platform.\u201d \u2014A former aide\n\n\u201cI think he is doing as well as he\u2019s doing,\u201d Giuliani said, referring to some polls suggesting GOP primary voters preferred the race-baiting conspiracy theorist from \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d \u201cbecause he\u2019s saying things the American people need to hear\u2014about leadership and about strength and about being proud of America and not apologizing for America. So I think he\u2019s resonating.\u201d\n\nBy early 2015, Giuliani\u2019s rhetoric about the 44th president had grown far more harsh\u2014more along the lines of what people had grown accustomed to from Trump.\n\n\u201cI do not believe that the president loves America,\u201d he said at a private dinner at New York\u2019s 21 Club. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t love you. And he doesn\u2019t love me. He wasn\u2019t brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up through love of this country.\u201d\n\nEven so, as Trump prepped for his real run for the White House, Giuliani was hardly top of mind at Trump Tower.\n\n\u201cNever heard him talk about him,\u201d said Sam Nunberg, Trump\u2019s most active, day-to-day political aide at the time.\n\n\n\n***\n\nShortly after launching his candidacy for the Republican nomination for president in 2015, Trump talks with Giuliani at a fundraising event in the Bronx. | AP Photo/Seth Wenig\n\nAnd it\u2019s not like Giuliani jumped at the chance to back Trump right when he came down that escalator.\n\nIt took him 10 months to endorse Trump.\n\nOnce he was in, though, he was \u2026 all in.\n\nGiuliani was, in the words of campaign brass Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie, a \u201csuper surrogate.\u201d He introduced Trump at rallies. He gave a thunderous speech on his behalf at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. He was involved in debate prep. And he was by far the most willing Trump defender on the Sunday shows following the leak of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape of Trump saying he could grab women \u201cby the pussy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do all of them,\u201d Giuliani offered. \u201cI\u2019ll do every Sunday show.\u201d\n\n\u201cMen at times talk like that,\u201d he said on CNN.\n\n\u201cLocker room talk,\u201d he said days later at a rally, parroting Trump.\n\n\u201cRudy wanted to be relevant again,\u201d a former aide told me. \u201cAnd Trump gave him that platform.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t find it curious when all of a sudden there was Rudy as a Trump supporter,\u201d former Manhattan borough president Ruth Messinger said when we talked this week, \u201cbecause he\u2019s interested in power. I think he was a person who was singularly unhappy being out of power.\u201d\n\nIn the summer of 2016, Giuliani is an outspoken Trump surrogate, introducing him at rallies (top) and sporting campaign merchandise after walking out of Trump Tower in New York City (bottom). | AP Photo/Evan Vucci; AP Photo/Craig Ruttle\n\n\u201cIt was a philosophical bonding as much as it was a personal bonding, and I think the philosophical preceded the personal,\u201d former Giuliani consultant Adam Goodman added. \u201cDonald Trump, I think, saw a kindred soul, a kindred spirit in Rudy. They\u2019re both fighters. There\u2019s a pugilism that underscores their beliefs and philosophy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe politicians I covered who were the most successful never apologized,\u201d said Kirtzman, the Giuliani biographer. \u201cAnd it didn\u2019t matter how wrong he was. Giuliani was always on offense.\u201d\n\nAfter Trump won, Giuliani wanted to be secretary of State, but Trump made him a cybersecurity adviser instead. He was undeterred, though. Giuliani joined the president\u2019s legal team. The lifelong Yankees fan got booed at Yankee Stadium. Last spring, the New Yorker called him \u201cTrump\u2019s clown.\u201d This spring, he seemed to relish that Trump at times calls him \u201cmy Rudy.\u201d Mainly, though, Giuliani has continued to be one of his more ardent and prominent attack dogs, as his interactions with reporters and appearances on TV have grown increasingly histrionic.\n\nGiuliani has, say people who have known him, worked for him and watched him over the years, living vicariously through Trump.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to be president,\u201d a former aide told me this week, \u201cand this is as close as he\u2019ll get.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery much,\u201d said another. \u201cI think it explains a lot of what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause he\u2019s got the same amount of hubris and the same Achilles\u2019 heel that Trump has,\u201d Trump biographer Tim O\u2019Brien said, \u201cwhich is that he hungers for and thrives on being in the public spotlight and cultivating power. And I think he saw Donald as a vehicle toward being a player again. It\u2019s a lesson in abject thirst for power.\u201d\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s election, Giuliani wanted a position in the administration\u2014hoping for Secretary of State. He currently acts as an attorney for the president. | Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nWilson, the Giuliani aide-turned-Trump critic, sees this as the end of a tragic arc. \u201cI think he reached a point where, you know, better to go out in the last gasp of excitement and fun and being a bomb-throwing, transgressive guy than to be the ex-mayor,\u201d he told me. \u201cThere\u2019s no other way Rudy\u2019s going to be on TV every single day. There\u2019s no other way he\u2019s going to be in the center of the national discourse every single day. So you take this gig, you take the good with the bad. And, you know, the bad is you may be liable for a whole variety of shit. And the good is you go out famous.\u201d\n\nRichard Ravitch, the 86-year-old former chairman of the New York State Urban Development Corporation and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, has known both men for decades. We talked briefly the other day.\n\n\u201cThey deserve each other,\u201d he said.\n\nNancy Cook contributed to this report.",
