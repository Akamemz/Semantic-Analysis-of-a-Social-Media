Just a few days prior , two of our associates were killed by another associate in our store in Southaven , Mississippi . And hours after the shooting in El Paso , our country experienced another mass shooting in Dayton , Ohio . This weekend brought tragedy to Midland and Odessa , Texas .\nIn Southaven and El Paso , our associates responded to anger and hate with courage and self-sacrifice . Our immediate priorities were supporting our associates and the impacted families and cooperating with law enforcement . In parallel , we have been focused on store safety and security . We 've also been listening to a lot of people inside and outside our company as we think about the role we can play in helping to make the country safer . It 's clear to us that the status quo is unacceptable .\nAfter visiting El Paso on Aug. 6 , I mentioned that we would be thoughtful and deliberate in our responses . We 're ready to share our next steps .\nWe 've been giving a lot of thought to our sale of firearms and ammunition . We 've previously made decisions to stop selling handguns or military-style rifles such as the AR-15 , to raise the age limit to purchase a firearm or ammunition to 21 , to require a `` green light '' on a background check while federal law only requires the absence of a `` red light , '' to videotape the point of sale for firearms and to only allow certain trained associates to sell firearms .\nToday , we 're sharing the decisions we 've made that go further :\n\u2022 After selling through our current inventory commitments , we will discontinue sales of short-barrel rifle ammunition such as the .223 caliber and 5.56 caliber that , while commonly used in some hunting rifles , can also be used in large capacity clips on military-style weapons ;\n\u2022 We will sell through and discontinue handgun ammunition ; and\n\u2022 We will discontinue handgun sales in Alaska , marking our complete exit from handguns .\nWe know these decisions will inconvenience some of our customers , and we hope they will understand . As a company , we experienced two horrific events in one week , and we will never be the same . Our remaining assortment will be even more focused on the needs of hunting and sport shooting enthusiasts . It will include long barrel deer rifles and shotguns , much of the ammunition they require , as well as hunting and sporting accessories and apparel . We believe these actions will reduce our market share of ammunition from around 20 % to a range of approximately 6 to 9 % . We believe it will likely drift toward the lower end of that range , over time , given the combination of these changes .\nAs it relates to safety in our stores , there have been multiple incidents since El Paso where individuals attempting to make a statement and test our response have entered our stores carrying weapons in a way that frightened or concerned our associates and customers . We have also had well-intentioned customers acting lawfully that have inadvertently caused a store to be evacuated and local law enforcement to be called to respond . These incidents are concerning and we would like to avoid them , so we are respectfully requesting that customers no longer openly carry firearms into our stores or Sam 's Clubs in states where `` open carry '' is permitted \u2013 unless they are authorized law enforcement officers .\nWe believe the opportunity for someone to misinterpret a situation , even in open carry states , could lead to tragic results . We hope that everyone will understand the circumstances that led to this new policy and will respect the concerns of their fellow shoppers and our associates . As it relates to concealed carry by customers with permits , there is no change to our policy or approach . This morning , we briefed your leadership team on how to communicate this change in policy to customers when needed , and they will be sharing that with you very soon . We will treat law-abiding customers with respect , and we will have a very non-confrontational approach . Our priority is your safety . We will be providing new signage to help communicate this policy in the coming weeks .\nAs an additional step , we commit we will work alongside other retailers to make the overall industry safer , including sharing our best practices . For example , we are exploring ways to share the technical specifications and compliance controls for our proprietary firearms sales technology platform .
