Better to go dark than play this game by the Clinton Rules .\nHillary really put a wrench in the media \u2019 s plans this week . After eagerly cheerleading Barack Obama for eight years , they stood ready to help break the ultimate glass ceiling and play their role as part of the uncritical chorus of Hillary Clinton \u2019 s coronation , first as the Democratic nominee then as president . It \u2019 s why they hate this story . It brings alive the memories of 30 years of the slimy , predatory Clinton enterprise and how its venal , sleazy , one-step-ahead-of-the-law hillbilly hustle stains everything it touches .\nCursed with both arrogance and inertia , the Bill and Hillary machine is stumbling toward political peril as the story of her possibly illegal ( and certainly dodgy and ill-advised ) use of private email servers consumes a Washington and New York press corps that for once can \u2019 t easily look away . The Clintons know we \u2019 re only at the end of the beginning of this story and the national security , legal and political implications for Hillary will get worse . The Clintons are depending on their old skills at manipulating the press and hoping the GOP and conservatives will save her by mishandling their response as badly as she \u2019 s mishandling hers .\nWhile the media \u2019 s passive \u201c attention span \u201d excuse du jour is real , many in the press are possessed of a boundless ideological desire to change the subject right now .

This is about her , not us , so unless GOP elected and opinion leaders are smart and subtle , and execute with the right timing and tone , she wins . Try for once to play the long game and help Hillary Clinton take on water .\nYou can sense the Clintons are on the back foot ; her now-infamous tweet and promises of transparency last week were nothing more than rehashed Clinton stalling tactics from the 1990s , when there were only a handful of media outlets and a relatively hermetic press culture .

Speak more in sorrow than in anger . Don \u2019 t make it all about Benghazi ( they \u2019 re expecting that ) or the record-keeping laws ( boring ) . Touch on those selectively , but focus instead on the grave national security risks that her amateur-hour email server shenanigan posed and more broadly what this says about the Clinton culture .
