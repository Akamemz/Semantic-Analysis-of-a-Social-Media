U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs said federal immigration authorities agreed to pull the July 6 directive and `` return to the status quo . ''\nA lawyer representing the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said only that the judge 's characterization was correct .\nThe announcement brings relief to thousands of foreign students who had been at risk of being deported from the country , along with hundreds of universities that were scrambling to reassess their plans for the fall in light of the policy .\nUnder the policy , international students in the U.S. would have been forbidden from taking all their courses online this fall . New visas would not have been issued to students at schools planning to provide all classes online , which includes Harvard . Students already in the U.S. would have faced deportation if they did n't transfer schools or leave the country voluntarily .\nImmigration officials issued the policy last week , reversing earlier guidance from March 13 telling colleges that limits around online education would be suspended during the pandemic . University leaders believed the rule was part of President Donald Trump 's effort to pressure the nation 's schools and colleges to reopen this fall even as new virus cases rise .\nThe policy drew sharp backlash from higher education institutions , with more than 200 signing court briefs supporting the challenge by Harvard and MIT . Colleges said the policy would put students ' safety at risk and hurt schools financially . Many schools rely on tuition from international students , and some stood to lose millions of dollars in revenue if the rule had taken hold .\nHarvard and MIT were the first to contest the policy , but at least seven other federal suits had been filed by universities and states opposing the rule .\nHarvard and MIT argued that immigration officials violated procedural rules by issuing the guidance without justification and without allowing the public to respond . They also argued that the policy contradicted ICE 's March 13 directive telling schools that existing limits on online education would be suspended `` for the duration of the emergency . ''\nThe suit noted that Mr. Trump 's national emergency declaration has not been rescinded and that virus cases are spiking in some regions .\nImmigration officials , however , argued that they told colleges all along that any guidance prompted by the pandemic was subject to change .
