These diverse voices , he writes , `` provide evidence that social media usage reduces mass political polarization . ''\nHis findings run counter , to some degree , with other findings about social media . For instance , an August Pew study concluded that people are n't eager to share their politics on social media , fearing that people may disagree with them . And a separate Pew study out Tuesday showed some Americans eager to drop friends over political differences . The Pew survey found 26 % of overall Facebook users -- and 44 % of `` consistent liberals '' and 31 % of `` consistent conservatives '' -- said they have blocked or de-friended someone on Facebook over politics .\nFor his study , NYU 's Mr. Barber\u00e1 tracked how people interact on social networks by taking active Twitter users in five states \u2013 Arkansas , California , Florida , Pennsylvania and Ohio -- and then matching them up with voting records . Mr. Barber\u00e1 ended up with a data set of 94,411 U.S. voters that matched Twitter profiles with 2012 voter turnout and party affiliation .\nMr. Barber\u00e1 found that those users who identified with a party often started out strongly leaning left or right in whom they followed \u2013 a conservative often started out following Republican members of Congress or the GOP on Twitter while a liberal may start following Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama -- but about a quarter of the people he tracked slowly added other voices into their feed , creating a feed that was increasingly more mixed in its politics .\nThese users also followed what Mr. Barber\u00e1 called \u201c weak links \u201d \u2013 connections from high school , social acquaintances and coworkers , which before social media wouldn \u2019 t necessarily be labeled as \u201c friends. \u201d Now , on social media , connections are sharing news and links \u2013 and often their political ideologies \u2013 with each other .\n\u201c The common wisdom is that when you go on social media , you are going to be exposed to content that reinforces your beliefs , \u201d Mr. Barber\u00e1 said . \u201c What these studies are ignoring is who is on social media and your level of interaction with those people . \u201d",
