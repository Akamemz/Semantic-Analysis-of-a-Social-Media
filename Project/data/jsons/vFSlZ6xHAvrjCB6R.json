Here's a list of four things you might want to know about how a continuing resolution works and how it might soften the blow of the sequester.\n\n1. Exactly what is a \"continuing resolution\"?\n\nThe continuing resolution, or CR for short, is legislation that basically allows Congress to just carry over the previous fiscal year's budget into the next one. In other words, it permits Congress to maintain roughly the same budget priorities and budget levels over the subsequent year. A CR can last for any length of time, whatever Congress wants \u2014 a few weeks, six months, a year, anything.\n\n2. Why would Congress want to pass a CR in the first place?\n\nLet's back up a little bit. Every year, Congress has to set funding levels for agencies and departments. According to the Constitution, Congress is supposed to do this through appropriations bills. But when Congress can't agree on what those appropriations should look like, they punt, by passing a continuing resolution. Or, they can pass individual appropriations bills for some departments and use a CR for the rest of the departments if they can't hammer out those particular budgets. Often Congress just passes a CR to buy itself more time.\n\nAnd if lawmakers can't even pass a CR before government funding runs out, the government could simply shut down.\n\n3. Is there a real threat of a government shutdown in this case?\n\nBoth House Speaker John Boehner and President Obama seem to agree \u2014 they're not interested in that particular game of chicken. The last time the government shut down was in 1995 and 1996, during the Clinton presidency. Republicans paid a political price for that.\n\nActually, lawmakers in Washington are used to passing continuing resolutions. Over the past 40 years, the CR has been the standard way of doing business on Capitol Hill. Going through the full, traditional appropriations process is a now very rare event in Washington.\n\n4. So how does the continuing resolution interact with the sequester?\n\nOh, right, there's the sequester. Because a sequester is in effect, figuring out what a budget will look like under a continuing resolution is going to be messier. As budget expert Stan Collender of Qorvis Communications put it, \"What's going to happen in March is a new definition of the phrase 'March Madness.' It will have less to do with college basketball and a lot to do with craziness in Washington on budget-related issues.\"\n\nCollender says because the continuing resolution is legislation that's coming after the sequester, it could theoretically cancel or modify the sequester \u2014 if Congress and the White House can agree on something.
