It might even be worse next week in New Hampshire .\nPollsters and other observers surveyed by \u2588\u2588\u2588 this week pointed to a number of reasons why New Hampshire is such a uniquely difficult state to poll . Chief among them : The volatility in the electorate that persists right up until voting begins .\n\u201c People are moving around from candidate to candidate , \u201d said Dante Scala , an assistant professor at the University of New Hampshire and author of a book on the state \u2019 s first-in-the-nation primary . \u201c I think if you called the same person in two successive nights , you might get two different answers of who they like . \u201d\nRecent polls indicate that Rubio , the first-term Florida senator who placed third in Iowa , is the early beneficiary of the post-caucuses momentum . Early tracking polls \u2013 a daily tracker launched this week by the University of Massachusetts-Lowell , and a small-sample , post-Iowa survey from the University of New Hampshire \u2013 show Rubio \u2019 s numbers ticking up .\nWhile the changes aren \u2019 t huge at the moment , they are significant in this regard : Rubio is seeking to parlay his momentum to break away from a pack of candidates who had been jockeying for second place behind Trump , a group that includes Cruz , Jeb Bush , John Kasich and Chris Christie . ( The early post-Iowa surveys show Cruz slightly ahead of Bush and Kasich , with Christie sagging lower . )\nBut before Rubio starts writing his victory speech Monday night , it \u2019 s worth recalling the most famous example of the failure of pre-election surveys to predict the outcome of the New Hampshire primary .\nOn Jan. 3 , 2008 \u2013 the day of the Iowa caucuses \u2013 Hillary Clinton led Barack Obama by 7 points in the RealClearPolitics average of New Hampshire polls . And then Obama won Iowa .\nDespite just four days separating Iowa and New Hampshire , Obama quickly surged in the polls , opening up an 8.3-point lead in the final RCP average .\nBut something happened on the way to an Obama sweep of the first two states : Clinton stormed from behind in the race \u2019 s final 24 hours , leading pollsters \u2013 including the industry \u2019 s professional organization , the American Association for Public Opinion Research \u2013 to conduct thorough reviews of industry practices .\nTheir most basic conclusion : Polls that stop days before the primary miss important shifts in voter preference that occur right up until Election Day .\n\u201c Late deciders haunt everybody , \u201d Scala said this week , recalling his expectation in 2008 that Obama would run away with the primary . \u201c I remember watching the actual returns come in and realizing half an hour in that wasn \u2019 t going to happen . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s a lesson the pollsters who survey New Hampshire are taking to heart . Late-deciding voters are the biggest reason why pollsters are lowering expectations that the pre-primary surveys will match the results next Tuesday .\n\u201c We expect way too much of polls , more than they could possibly deliver , \u201d said University of New Hampshire pollster Andy Smith , who is conducting surveys for CNN and Manchester 's WMUR-TV . \u201c We \u2019 re asking people what they plan to do , and they really don \u2019 t know . \u201d\n\u201c These people really are volatile , \u201d added Monmouth University pollster Patrick Murray . \u201c They really are undecided . Even if they pick a candidate today or tomorrow , they can change their mind . \u201d\nThe seven-day interval between the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary last year , while longer than 2008 , also poses challenges .\n\u201c It comes very soon after Iowa , which is a major news event , \u201d warned Steve Koczela , the president of the MassINC Polling Group , which polls the state for WBUR-FM , the Boston-area NPR affiliate . \u201c Any time you do a poll right after a major news event , you can expect changes . And the New Hampshire primary comes right during those changes . \u201d\nThat leaves those polling New Hampshire with a limited window . They want to measure changes since Iowa , but the news organizations that commission those polls don \u2019 t necessarily want to wait until the last minute . ( Besides , some pollsters believe releasing horse-race polls on Election Day is an unethical practice that could unfairly influence results . )\nMassINC \u2019 s Koczela said the horse-race is only one reason why news organizations commission polls . A more important purpose , he said , is to provide a meaningful narrative of the campaign \u2013 even if that means leaving the field earlier and undermining the survey \u2019 s chances of more closely matching the election results .\n\u201c In terms of accuracy , it would be nice to poll right up until the very last minute , \u201d said Koczela . \u201c But there are other things that are important other than accuracy . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s an issue in all elections \u2013 and late-deciders are a more acute problem in primaries , where voters generally like most of the candidates and are n't making their decisions based on partisan cues , as in general elections .\nThe timing of these surveys also highlights a common complaint among pollsters : Too much attention is paid to the horse-race , and their surveys are mostly being used to predict the results of elections .\n\u201c The public wants to know what the score is , \u201d UNH \u2019 s Smith said , \u201c but I think it behooves public opinion researchers that we try to tell the public the real story of what \u2019 s going on . \u201d\nLate deciders aren \u2019 t the only challenge facing New Hampshire pollsters . Some cited the state \u2019 s open primary system , in which unaffiliated voters can participate in either party \u2019 s primary .\nKoczela pointed to the past two presidential races without an incumbent as evidence of how undeclared voters can shift . In 2000 , he said , many of them participated in the Republican race to back Arizona Sen. John McCain over George W. Bush . But , in 2008 , the Democratic race was more compelling , and independents were more likely to pull ballots in the Obama-Clinton contest .\n\u201c It means the electorate is quite different each time , \u201d said Koczela . \u201c There \u2019 s not a repeat of how things looked in a previous elections . \u201d\nSmith , however , insists Koczela and others are making too much of the independent factor . \u201c Most of them are partisans , \u201d he said . \u201c They vote consistently partisan \u2013 and vote consistently in their party \u2019 s primary . \u201d\nAnother complication : The sheer number of polls and calls from campaigns in the state has left voters dreading the ringing of their telephones .\n\u201c People in New Hampshire are inundated with calls and information and requests on their time , \u201d said UMass-Lowell pollster Joshua Dyck . \u201c It \u2019 s not only pollsters calling voters , it \u2019 s also campaigns calling voters . \u201d\nYet there are also ways in which polling New Hampshire is an easier endeavor than Iowa . Pollsters cited the extremely high turnout rates for presidential primaries in New Hampshire , which can draw more than half the eligible voters . ( In Iowa , on the other hand , fewer than one-in-five active voters participated in Monday \u2019 s caucuses . )\nPollsters said that makes it easier to ensure that they aren \u2019 t including too many non-voters in their surveys .\n\u201c Turnout here is so high , \u201d said Smith . \u201c Turnout in 2008 , for example , was 54 percent [ of voting-age residents ] . No other state has anything like that . \u201d\nPollsters are hoping they can avoid another in a long line of embarrassing misses in New Hampshire : Ronald Reagan won a landslide victory over George H.W . Bush in 1980 , but the polls overstated the former California governor \u2019 s advantage . Walter Mondale led Gary Hart in the polls in 1984 after romping in Iowa , but Hart pulled the upset in New Hampshire .\nIn 1988 , Gallup showed Kansas Sen. Bob Dole entering the New Hampshire primary with an 8-point lead over Bush .\n\u201c Dole was up by 7-to-10 points , \u201d Marist College pollster Lee Miringoff recalled this week . \u201c Everybody was saying , \u2018 Dole on a roll . \u2019 \u201d\nBut Bush won by 9 points \u2013 leaving pollsters again to conclude that they should have kept polling to the end .
