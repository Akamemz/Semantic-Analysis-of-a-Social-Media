    "content": "Republicans were trying to tamp down a conservative rebellion Wednesday and keep a stopgap spending bill on track ahead of a major vote Thursday , hoping to prove their party could govern and in the process trap Democrats in a shutdown showdown .\nThe bill includes government funding through mid-February , extends the popular Children \u2019 s Health Insurance Program and delays a series of unpopular Obamacare taxes , though it doesn \u2019 t include any action on immigration \u2014 something Democrats had demanded .\nTop Democrats and Republicans did manage Wednesday to restart negotiations over a solution for illegal immigrant Dreamers by holding their first meeting in a week . In what passes as progress on Capitol Hill , they agreed to meet again Thursday to talk about how to continue meeting moving forward toward a bill that meets President Trump \u2019 s four goals .\n\u201c What we are trying to do is just get a schedule of meetings , \u201d said Sen. Thom Tillis , North Carolina Republican . \u201c That was the goal [ to ] get in a room . \u201d\nGiven the time crunch , it \u2019 s unlikely any immigration deal could be added to the spending bill , which Republican leaders have scheduled for a vote on the House floor Thursday .\nRepublicans had hoped for easy passage in the House , where their numbers control the process , and send the bill to the Senate , where Democrats would have to decide whether to either accept the deal or filibuster , sending the government into a partial shutdown .\nRepublican leaders saw a chance to flip the script that for more than two decades has given them the blame for shutdown showdowns .\nBut conservatives were undermining those plans , threatening to defeat the spending bill unless it catered to their own demands for more military money and a promise to vote on a strict immigration crackdown bill in the future .\nRep.
