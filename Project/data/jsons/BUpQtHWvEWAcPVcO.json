Here\u2019s a status check on major lawsuits:\n\n- \u201cObamacare\u201d Repeal\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Reed O\u2019Connor in Fort Worth, Texas, ruled that when Congress repealed the ACA\u2019s fines for being uninsured, it knocked the constitutional foundation out from under the entire law. His ruling is being appealed by attorneys general from Democratic-led states to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.\n\nThe challenge to the ACA was filed by officials from Texas and other GOP-led states.

All sides expect the case to go to the Supreme Court, which has twice before upheld the ACA.\n\n- Medicaid Work Requirements\n\nU.S. District Court Judge James E.
