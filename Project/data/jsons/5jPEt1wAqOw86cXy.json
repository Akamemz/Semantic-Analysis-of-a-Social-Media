    "content": "Fresh off a series of weekend victories in state caucuses , Bernie Sanders turned up the heat on Hillary Clinton at Sunday \u2019 s debate in Flint , Mich. , sharply challenging her economic credentials and suggesting her gun control stand would ban guns in America . But the Democratic front-runner fought back , blasting him for voting against the auto bailout , dismissing him as a \u201c one-issue candidate \u201d and hitting him once again for his stance on guns .\nThe Vermont senator reached back to the 1990s as he went after Clinton \u2019 s support for \u201c disastrous trade agreements \u201d like NAFTA . His rhetoric was notably more pointed and , reflecting the tension in the race , Sanders even cut her off at times as she tried to speak over him .\n\u201c Excuse me , I \u2019 m talking , \u201d Sanders snapped , during one feisty exchange on the economy .\nBut Clinton pushed back , and defended the country \u2019 s economic progress during her husband \u2019 s administration .\n\u201c If we \u2019 re going to argue about the \u2018 90s , let \u2019 s try to get the facts straight , \u201d she said , touting the jobs and income growth that came with the era .\nSanders also tried to cast Clinton as soft on climate change , while declaring he unequivocally does not support fracking . Clinton maintained she has the \u201c most comprehensive plan to combat climate change . \u201d\nThe clashes came after Sanders won the Maine Democratic caucuses , adding to wins the night before in Nebraska and Kansas \u2014 by far the most successful two days of his campaign .\nBut Sanders remains significantly behind in the race for delegates , with Clinton having won more \u2013 and more valuable \u2013 state contests , as well as enjoying the overwhelming support of so-called \u201c superdelegates. \u201d Sanders is looking for a game-changer as the race heads next to states like Michigan this coming Tuesday , and Ohio and Florida the week after that .\nSanders cited his most recent wins at the end of Sunday \u2019 s debate , in arguing he would be the better candidate to go up against Republican front-runner Donald Trump .\nHe began to joke he \u2019 d give his \u201c right arm \u201d to run against the billionaire businessman and then cited polls saying , \u201c Sanders versus Trump does a lot better than Clinton versus Trump . \u201d\nBut while Sanders said he \u2019 s \u201c exciting \u201d working-class and young voters , Clinton pointed to the raw numbers .\n\u201c There \u2019 s only one candidate [ in either primary campaign ] who has more votes than [ Trump ] , and that \u2019 s me , \u201d Clinton said . \u201c I will look forward to engaging him . \u201d\nWith the CNN-hosted debate held in Michigan , the state \u2019 s economic and crime problems were front and center .\nOn gun control , the two candidates sparred sharply , with Clinton using the Sandy Hook massacre to make a point about holding gun makers responsible for crimes \u2013 and Sanders arguing that position would effectively mean an America without guns .\nThe dispute started when Sanders defended his past support for a bill to help protect gun manufacturers and sellers from lawsuits .
