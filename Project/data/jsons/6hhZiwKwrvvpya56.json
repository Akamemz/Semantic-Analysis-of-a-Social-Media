We could use more like him .\nBeverly Hills , Calif. \u2014 The late David Koch put his name on a few things and his money behind a great many , prominent among them the theater in which the New York City Ballet performs . The facility had become run down , and Koch put up $ 100 million for renovations and ongoing maintenance . That is one of the neat things you can do when you are a billionaire .\nAn \u201c infamous right-wing billionaire , \u201d L. A . Weekly called him . In announcing Koch \u2019 s death on Friday , the New York Times described him as a funder of the \u201c right-wing libertarian movement . \u201d\nIs there a \u201c right-wing libertarian movement \u201d ? And was David Koch emblematic of it ?\nKoch was for many years a trustee of Reason magazine and a benefactor of the kind of politics associated with it . I am not at all sure that if the term \u201c right-wing \u201d today means anything at all it means something that includes former Reason editor Nick Gillespie or current Reason editor Katherine Mangu-Ward . Koch himself was a supporter of gay rights , abortion rights , drug legalization , and much else that does not fit very comfortably on the current \u201c right wing \u201d agenda , although to be sure that political calculus gets pretty complicated pretty quickly : There are a fair number of libertarian-minded conservatives who , though they object to abortion on libertarian grounds ( that it violates the rights of the unborn child ) , take a much more liberal attitude toward the private lives of consenting adults .\nBut the part of David Koch \u2019 s career in public life that may be most offensive to the contemporary incarnation of the \u201c right wing \u201d isn \u2019 t the drugs or the abortion or the gay rights , or anything else on the current policy agenda .\nKoch , born in 1940 , came from an era in which conservatives had not abandoned the cities , their institutions , and their culture , had not declared Lincoln Center and all of Manhattan \u2014 and California and Chicago and Wall Street and the Ivy League \u2014 enemy territory . He was part of a conservative movement founded by William F. Buckley Jr. ( born 1925 ) and adorned by such men as art critic Hilton Kramer ( born 1928 ) , who co-founded The New Criterion ( where I had the honor of writing the theater column for a few years ) with Samuel Lipman , a celebrated pianist and trenchant critic of the National Endowment for the Arts and the politically driven vulgarization of all it touched . These were urban men , members of the hated \u201c elite , \u201d and even in many cases part of the \u201c establishment. \u201d Some of them were known to frequent Bohemian Grove .\nBecause I write for \u2588\u2588\u2588 , I sometimes receive accusations of \u201c elitism , \u201d as though \u201c elitist \u201d were a disqualifying epithet , and as though \u201c elitism \u201d consisted of knowing which fork to use and making a terribly big deal of it . I sometimes remind people that \u2588\u2588\u2588 was founded by a man whose challenges in life included figuring out how to get his harpsichord onto his yacht so that he could play J. S. Bach \u2019 s \u201c Chromatic Fantasy \u201d when he wanted to . ( He kept an electronic keyboard on the boat for continued practice at sea . ) Buckley could be a scouring critic of elites failing at their natural responsibilities \u2014 his public career began with a book-length assault on the failures of Yale , and he had a famously low opinion of the collective political wisdom of the Harvard faculty \u2014 but he also despised the supposed \u201c authority of political truths arrived at yesterday at the voting booth. \u201d I can not imagine that it ever would have occurred to him that there was something more authentically American \u2014 or more conservative \u2014 about raising hogs in Arkansas than about dancing in the New York City Ballet .\nBefore he linked up with Team Trump , Senator Ted Cruz of Texas sneered at the future president as an embodiment of \u201c New York values. \u201d Ted Cruz of Princeton and Harvard , clerk to a chief justice of the Supreme Court , husband to a muckety-muck at Goldman Sachs , resident of the nation \u2019 s fourth-largest city , for some reason felt the need to turn up his nose at \u201c New York values , \u201d meaning urban values , some of which \u2014 for instance , the ones on display from time to time at the David H.
