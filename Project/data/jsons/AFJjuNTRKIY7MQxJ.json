    "content": "The Affordable Care Act was supposed to make health care more affordable , but a study of insurance policies before and after Obamacare shows that average premiums have skyrocketed , for some groups by as much as 78 percent .\nAverage insurance premiums in the sought-after 23-year-old demographic rose most dramatically , with men in that age group seeing an average 78.2 percent price increase before factoring in government subsidies , and women having their premiums rise 44.9 percent , according to a report by HealthPocket scheduled for release Wednesday .\nThe study , which was shared Tuesday with The \u2588\u2588\u2588 , examined average health insurance premiums before the implementation of Obamacare in 2013 and then afterward in 2014 . The research focused on people of three ages \u2014 23 , 30 and 63 \u2014 using data for nonsmoking men and women with no spouses or children .\nThe premium increases for 30-year-olds were almost as high as for 23-year-olds \u2014 73.4 percent for men and 35.1 percent for women \u2014 said the study , titled \u201c Without Subsidies Women & Men , Old & Young Average Higher Monthly Premiums with Obamacare . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s very eye-opening in terms of the transformation occurring within the individual health insurance market , \u201d said Kev Coleman , head of research and data at HealthPocket , a nonpartisan , independently managed subsidiary of Health Insurance Innovations in Sunnyvale , California .\n\u201c I was surprised in general to see the differences in terms of the average premiums in the pre-reform and post-reform markets , \u201d Mr. Coleman said . \u201c It was a higher amount than I had anticipated . \u201d\nThe eye-popping increases among younger insurance buyers could be a problem for Obamacare \u2019 s long-term solvency given that young people need to enroll to offset the higher costs associated with older policyholders .\n\u201c Obviously they \u2019 re very important , and as much as they \u2019 re healthier , they tend to use health care less , so you want to try and have as many of those people enrolled as possible .
