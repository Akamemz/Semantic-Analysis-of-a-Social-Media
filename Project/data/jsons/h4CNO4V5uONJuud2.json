Prosecutors necessarily weigh a number of factors before deciding whether to bring charges . ''\nClinton spokesman Brian Fallon said the campaign was happy the FBI probe was now in the rearview mirror . `` We are pleased that the career officials handling this case have determined that no further action by the Department is appropriate , \u201d Fallon said in a statement on Tuesday afternoon . \u201c As the Secretary has long said , it was a mistake to use her personal email and she would not do it again . We are glad that this matter is now resolved . ''\nWhile the FBI \u2019 s recommendation not to bring charges removes a significant hurdle in the way of Clinton and her presidential campaign , the presumptive Democratic nominee is likely to continue facing questions about her use of private email until November and beyond .\nComey \u2019 s decision to pepper his remarks with an array of judgmental language directed at Clinton and her aides provided plenty of fodder for Republicans eager to drive home with voters the former secretary of state \u2019 s trustworthiness problem .\nStill , Republicans quickly denounced the decision by Comey , who was appointed to his current role by President Barack Obama in 2013 and had been appointed to his prior roles by George W. Bush .\n\u201c The system is rigged . General Petraeus got in trouble for far less . Very very unfair ! As usual , bad judgment , \u201d Trump tweeted Tuesday morning , making reference to the disgraced former CIA director who resigned in the wake of an extramarital affair with his biographer with whom he had shared classified information .\nTrump followed up with a statement in the afternoon , saying Comey offered up a detailed case on how Clinton \u201c compromised the safety of the American people . \u201d\n\u201c Our adversaries almost certainly have a blackmail file on Hillary Clinton , and this fact alone disqualifies her from service , \u201d he said .\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan also tweeted his dismay , writing , \u201c While I respect the professionals at the FBI , this announcement defies explanation . No one should be above the law . \u201d\nComey , who did not take questions during the press conference , detailed specific findings from the FBI \u2019 s investigators , who interviewed Clinton just last Saturday morning for three-and-half hours .\nSome of the findings contradicted statements from Clinton \u2019 s camp , which has long sought to downplay the seriousness of the probe and of the classified information on Clinton \u2019 s private server .\nOf the 30,000 emails Clinton turned over to the State Department in 2014 , Comey announced that 110 emails in 52 separate chains had been determined to contain classified information \u201c at the time they were sent or received , \u201d contradicting Clinton \u2019 s claim that she neither sent nor received information that was deemed classified at the time . Of those , he continued , eight included \u201c Top Secret \u201d information , while 36 chains had \u201c Secret \u201d information at the time it was received , and eight contained \u201c Confidential \u201d information , the lowest level of classification .\n\u201c None of these emails should have been on any kind of unclassified system , but their presence is especially concerning because all of these emails were housed on unclassified personal servers not even supported by full-time security staff , like those found at departments and agencies of the U.S. government \u2014 or even with a commercial service like Gmail , \u201d Comey said .\nIn addition to those emails , Comey continued , another 2,000 were \u201c up-classified \u201d to make them \u201c Confidential \u201d after they had already been sent .\n\u201c But even if information is not marked \u2018 classified \u2019 in an email , participants who know or should know that the subject matter is classified are still obligated to protect it , \u201d Comey said .\nThe FBI \u2019 s investigation is only the latest probe into one of the Clintons \u2019 alleged wrongdoings , following multiple investigations into Clinton \u2019 s response to the 2012 attacks in Benghazi , Libya , and an array of scandals that dogged President Bill Clinton during his time in the White House .\nClinton herself has lamented the lack of trust voters have indicated they have in her , from recent polls .\n`` And I \u2019 ve thought a lot about what \u2019 s behind it , '' Clinton said June 27 at the International Women 's Luncheon in Chicago , the site of the 50th annual Rainbow PUSH Coalition Convention . `` And you know , you hear 25 years \u2019 worth of wild accusations , anyone would start to wonder . And it certainly is true \u2014 I \u2019 ve made mistakes . I don \u2019 t know anyone who hasn \u2019 t . So I understand people having questions . ''\nBut even the integrity of the FBI \u2019 s investigation was called into question when Bill Clinton had an impromptu meeting that same day with Attorney General Loretta Lynch . On Friday , Lynch said their meeting `` cast a shadow '' over the investigation and asserted that she `` certainly would n't do it again . '' She also added that she `` fully '' expects to accept the recommendations she receives from career prosecutors .\nComey on Tuesday emphasized that `` no outside influence of any kind was brought to bear . ''\nTrump , however , said he did n't believe it . `` Bill Clinton didn \u2019 t accidentally run into the Attorney General on the airport tarmac last week in Phoenix , '' Trump said in his statement . `` Hillary Clinton didn \u2019 t accidentally sneak into the FBI during one of the country \u2019 s biggest holiday weekends to testify on her illegal activities , something that wouldn \u2019 t be afforded to others under investigation ( and on a Saturday of all days ) . It was no accident that charges were not recommended against Hillary the exact same day as President Obama campaigns with her for the first time . ''\nPatrick Leahy , the highest-level Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee , said he takes Comey at his word that the FBI \u201c conducted an apolitical and professional investigation \u201d and hopes the Justice Department will take a similar approach .\n\u201c I trust that the Department of Justice career prosecutors will consider the FBI \u2019 s recommendation and make a final decision based on facts , not politics , \u201d Leahy said in a statement .\nRepublicans , though , ripped into the FBI \u2019 s non-recommendation , with Ari Fleischer , the former press secretary for George W. Bush tweeting , \u201c Bottom line : Hillary is reckless , careless and has poor judgement , but she 's not a criminal . Which means she 's likely to be our next POTUS . \u201d\n\u201c The FBI decision shows once again how the Clintons and others at the top get to live by a different set of rules from everyone else , \u201d tweeted Rep. Darrell Issa ( R-Calif. ) , the former chairman for the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee .\nBernie Sanders \u2019 campaign , meanwhile , said he still has no intention of imminently dropping out of the race , despite the FBI \u2019 s decision .\nIn prosecuting similar cases , Comey noted that past instances have `` involved some combination of clearly intentional and willful mishandling of classified information or vast quantities of information exposed in such a way as to support an inference of intentional misconduct or indications of disloyalty to the United States or efforts to obstruct justice . ''\n`` We do not see those things here . To be clear , this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances , a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences . To the contrary , those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions , but that 's not what we 're deciding now , '' Comey added . \u201c As a result , although the Department of Justice makes final decisions on matters like this , we are expressing to Justice our view that no charges are appropriate in this case . ''\nAmong those uncovered that were not produced to the State Department , Comey said that three of them were classified when they were sent or received , one at the Secret level and two at the Confidential Level .\n\u201c I should add here that we found no evidence that any of the additional work-related emails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them , \u201d Comey explained . \u201c Our assessment is that , like many email users , Secretary Clinton periodically deleted emails or emails were purged from the system when devices were changed . Because she was not using a government account\u2014or even a commercial account like Gmail\u2014there was no archiving at all of her emails , so it is not surprising that we discovered emails that were not on Secretary Clinton \u2019 s system in 2014 , when she produced the 30,000 emails to the State Department . \u201d\nComey said investigators did not find \u201c direct evidence \u201d that Clinton \u2019 s personal email domain , in its various configurations since 2009 , had been compromised by hackers .\n\u201c But , given the nature of the system and of the actors potentially involved , we assess that we would be unlikely to see such direct evidence , \u201d he added . \u201c We do assess that hostile actors gained access to the private commercial email accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in regular contact from her personal account . We also assess that Secretary Clinton \u2019 s use of a personal email domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent . She also used her personal email extensively while outside the United States , including sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries . Given that combination of factors , we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton \u2019 s personal email account . \u201d\nAnticipating the reaction to the recommendation , Comey said , `` I know there will be intense public debate in the wake of this recommendation as there was throughout the investigation . What I can assure the American people is that this investigation was done honestly , competently and independently . ''\n`` I know there were many opinions expressed by people not part of the investigation , including people in government , but none of that mattered to us , '' he concluded . `` Opinions are irrelevant , and they were all uninformed by insight into our investigation because we did our investigation the right way . Only facts matter , and the FBI found them here in an entirely apolitical and professional way . I could n't be prouder to be part of this organization . ''\nComey prefaced the announcement by saying that he has not coordinated his statement with the Justice Department or any other government agency .\n\u201c They do not know what I 'm about to say , \u201d Comey said , thanking the agents who worked on the case .\nCampaign spokesman Nick Merrill told reporters in a statement Saturday that Clinton was `` pleased '' to help assist the Justice Department in wrapping up its investigation but said Clinton would n't offer any additional comments regarding the interview `` out of respect for the investigative process . ''\nClinton told MSNBC 's Chuck Todd in a phone interview Saturday that she was `` eager '' to meet with the FBI but had `` no knowledge '' of when the federal agency would conclude its investigation .\nLongtime Obama aide and strategist David Axelrod on Tuesday morning tweeted that Comey \u2019 s statement in which he recommended no charges but rebuked Clinton for carelessness \u201c is about [ the ] best result she could get . \u201d",
