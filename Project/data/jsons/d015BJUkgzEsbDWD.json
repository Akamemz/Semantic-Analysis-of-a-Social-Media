    "content": "A few days before Washington staggered into what would become the longest shutdown in U.S. history , Chuck Schumer received a request from Donald Trump .\nThe president wanted the Senate minority leader to visit the White House to discuss his demands for the border wall , which would need Democratic votes to pass the GOP-controlled Senate . Previously , Schumer had held one-on-one negotiations with Trump . But this time , the New York Democrat had a new condition : \u201c Only with Nancy . \u201d\n\u201c We do it all together , that \u2019 s an agreement we had from the get-go , \u201d Schumer said of his stance with Speaker Nancy Pelosi on not giving Trump an inch on the wall .\n\u201c We realize we \u2019 re a team , \u201d Schumer said in an interview . \u201c Sometimes we talk strategy four to five times a day . And there are times we disagree . But we come to the same result . \u201d\nRepublicans have tried to drive a wedge between the duo for more than a month now . They \u2019 ve cast Schumer as eager to cut a deal and Pelosi as an impediment . They \u2019 ve floated the idea that Pelosi would be more willing to compromise after she was elected speaker . Trump tried again on Saturday , pitching temporary protections for Dreamers and other immigrants , in exchange for $ 5.7 billion in border wall funding .\nDemocrats believe the only way to get the president to cave on the wall and reopen the government is to stick together , a plan they reiterated when they rejected Trump 's latest proposal .\nAnd by setting a model of unity , Schumer and Pelosi have kept moderates in their caucuses from breaking ranks and underscored how difficult it will be for Trump to get Democrats to fold . From House freshmen in districts Trump won in 2016 to centrist Senate Democrats like Joe Manchin of West Virginia , they \u2019 ve all said : Open the government , then let \u2019 s talk about the border .\nRepublicans say that rank-and-file Democrats are more eager to break from their leaders than they let on and have been frustrated by the party \u2019 s lockstep opposition .\n\u201c Every one of them has an election certificate , and it \u2019 s not signed by Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi . So do what you think is right , \u201d Sen. Lisa Murkowski ( R-Alaska ) said .\nBut with a combined 70 years of service on Capitol Hill , the two are the experienced , old-school pols that many Democrats want leading them against a volatile and capricious president . That \u2019 s even as Schumer and Pelosi , 68 and 78 respectively , diverge in some ways from their party , which is more diverse and younger than ever .\nAnd though the Democratic leaders came up in the House together , represent liberal coastal areas and even were part of the same dinner group years ago , their approach to politics often differs .\nSchumer tends to slouch when the cameras are turned off and brings leftovers into the Senate each week . Pelosi has become something of a fashion icon , clad in tailored pantsuits or dresses , often with matching high heels . One of Pelosi \u2019 s coats even took on a life of its own \u2014 resulting in the designer bringing it back because of overwhelming demand \u2014 after she wore it to tangle with Trump in January .\nSchumer fashions himself a messaging and political guru and is known for ingratiating himself with his members . He was accused by liberals of not whipping his moderate members hard enough last year against GOP priorities , but consolidated power internally by giving centrists an opportunity to craft their own political images .\nPelosi hails from a Baltimore political dynasty and is more of a blunt operator . She also deals with internal critics swiftly and efficiently ; she blocked Rep. Kathleen Rice ( D-N.Y. ) from a plum committee spot for having tried to oust her as party leader , for example .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a magical odd couple , \u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal ( D-Conn. ) said . \u201c Very different backgrounds , different religions , different manners , different physical appearances . He \u2019 s the Jewish Brooklyn guy ; she is the West Coast , you know , sort of glamorous hobnobbing with movie stars . \u201d\nDuring Trump \u2019 s first two years , Pelosi would often defer to her Senate counterpart , who had the ability to filibuster GOP legislation . As the new House speaker , Pelosi \u2019 s effectively canceling Trump \u2019 s State of the Union address . With Pelosi now the top Democrat in Washington , \u201c the dynamic is changing , \u201d said one lawmaker with insight into the relationship between the two party leaders .\nPelosi and Schumer appear to be managing the shift in power relatively well . But their tag-team leadership style has at times opened them up to criticism .\nWhen they learned that Trump would give a prime-time address on the border wall earlier this month , Pelosi and Schumer connected immediately . They ruled out picking a rank-and-file member or young , rising Democratic star to push back against Trump , ignoring those who noted the two leaders aren \u2019 t the most dynamic speakers in the party .\nAnd though Pelosi now outranks Schumer , they decided they \u2019 d do it together . They were the ones who had spent hours with Trump , and they would be the best at responding to him .\n\u201c Why not pick someone else ? Because you had to do it very quickly , we didn \u2019 t know what he was going to say , \u201d Schumer recalled . \u201c We knew him best and what he would say and what he had said before . \u201d\nStill , their response to Trump sparked laughs as they shared a podium , staring unsmiling and stiffly at the camera .\n\u201c Oh , my God , \u201d said one freshman Democrat . \u201c Visually , it wasn \u2019 t the best idea . \u201d\n\u201c It did look funny , there was no doubt about it , '' said Rep.
