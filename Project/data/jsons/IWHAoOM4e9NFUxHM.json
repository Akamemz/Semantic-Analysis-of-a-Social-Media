A second trial is scheduled for West Virginia in January . The decisions in these and other test cases would then be used to shape a broad settlement covering many of the federal lawsuits across the US .\nUntil now , Johnson & Johnson has steadfastly refused to settle similar lawsuits and has strongly denied any responsibility for the epidemic , saying it was doing no more than manufacturing a legal drug . But in August it lost a landmark case in Oklahoma , where a judge found the company was instrumental in causing addiction and death with a \u201c false and dangerous \u201d sales campaign that helped drive the crisis .\nThe state of Oklahoma sued the company , saying it ran a \u201c cunning , cynical and deceitful scheme \u201d to mass market opioid painkillers with false claims that there was little risk of addiction from the drugs . The judge ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $ 572m in the first year of a longer term settlement .\nJohnson & Johnson made no admission of liability in the Ohio settlement and said it reached agreement in order to direct money and effort toward addressing the opioid crisis . But Carl Tobias , a law professor at the University of Richmond , said the Oklahoma loss will have weighed heavily on the company going into the Ohio trial .\n\u201c Johnson & Johnson has a reputation for litigating to the bitter end but Oklahoma may have been a wake-up call because they thought they were going to win .
