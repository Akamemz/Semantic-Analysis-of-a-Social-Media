And should he lose , it threatens the legitimacy of those left to govern after the most anarchic election in modern history .\n`` Remember , we are competing in a rigged election , '' Trump said at a Wisconsin rally Monday night . `` They even want to try and rig the election at the polling booths , where so many cities are corrupt and voter fraud is all too common . ''\nHis accusations alone , experts say , could inflict long-standing damage on the US political system itself by eroding trust in the probity of the electoral process .\nEver since a weary George Washington rode home to Mount Vernon in 1797 , American democracy has rested on a cherished principle : the transfer of power from an outgoing president to a successor widely seen as legitimate .\n`` The most important thing in the system is that the winners win and the losers lose , '' said Mark Braden , former chief counsel of the Republican National Committee . `` Almost as important as that is that the rational people that support the loser believes that the winner won . ''\nOne of Trump 's GOP primary rivals , Florida Sen. Marco Rubio , rejected Trump 's claims that the election is being `` rigged . ''\n`` This election is not being rigged , '' Rubio , who is now seeking re-election to his Senate seat , said in a debate Monday against Democratic challenger Rep. Patrick Murphy . `` There is no evidence behind any of this , so this should not continue to be said . ''\nTrump 's accusations come as his campaign slips further behind Democrat Hillary Clinton three weeks from Election Day , prompting him to deal in ever more conspiratorial claims that shield him from culpability in his own fate . And there is every sign that his most loyal supporters accept his warnings that a `` horror show '' is taking place and that the election could be `` stolen . ''\nHistory has seen accusations of election-swaying before , from John F. Kennedy 's henchmen allegedly cheating Richard Nixon out of the presidency in 1960 to the infamous hanging chads of the Florida recount in 2000 . But Trump 's repeated claims that the election is already being rigged are the electoral equivalent of the nuclear option .\nEssentially , he is saying in advance that the election is illegitimate rather than challenging the results after signs of wrongdoing once the votes are counted .\n`` History is replete with illegal things going on during elections , but at this point in the 21st Century , to make the grandiose statement like Trump is -- that the election is rigged is bogus -- it is anti-democratic spirit , it is anti-American at its core , '' said CNN historian Douglas Brinkley from Rice University on CNN 's `` New Day '' on Monday .\nJUST WATCHED Study : Voter fraud is rare Replay More Videos ...
