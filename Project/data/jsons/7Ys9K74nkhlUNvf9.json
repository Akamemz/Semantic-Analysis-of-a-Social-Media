ABC 7 Chicago Many on both sides are highly critical of the prosecutor : \u201c It \u2019 s an indefensible decision , a deal hashed out in secret , with \u2014 this is outrageous \u2014 Smollett not even required to take ownership of his apparent hoax . Not even required to apologize for allegedly exploiting hate crime laws . And not even required to reimburse Chicago taxpayers for the enormous cost of this investigation\u2026 Unless there \u2019 s yet one more big revelation in this case that makes the prosecutors \u2019 decision sensible , it will further erode citizens \u2019 trust in law enforcement. \u201d Editorial Board , Chicago Tribune \u201c Whatever Mr. Magats may pretend about this being no exoneration , Mr. Smollett and his attorneys are claiming exactly that . Mr. Smollett asserted as he left the courthouse that he \u2019 s been \u2018 truthful and consistent \u2019 from the start , and he \u2019 s still claiming he was attacked by two people he was unable to identify . Mayor Emanuel and Police Superintendent Johnson are right . This deal stinks , and the city of Chicago deserves an apology . \u201d Editorial Board , Wall Street Journal Other opinions below .\nFrom the Left Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel held a press conference in which he stated , `` This is an unbelievable\u2026 whitewash of justice , this is a person now who got off scot-free with no sense of accountability of the moral and ethical wrong of his actions , from top to bottom , not only besmirching the name of the city ... but you have a person using hate crime laws that are on the books to protect people who are minorities from violence , to turn around and use those laws to advance your career ? Is there no decency in this man ? ''\n\u201c The explanation was as forced as it was false . First , Cook County presumably has not decided to confine prosecutions to violent crimes , or everything from blackmail to bank fraud to tax evasion would be effectively immunized\u2026\n\u201c This was not just any nonviolent offense . Smollett sent a city into crisis and caused the Chicago Police Department to direct huge resources into the search for racist , homophobic Trump supporters terrorizing innocent citizens . Magats said that the office did not want to use limited resources to go after nonviolent crime , but it already spent those resources in uncovering the hoax and securing 16 charges . All that remained was what looked like a perfunctory trial . \u201d\n\u201c I started caring about the Smollett story because of the reaction to the story , because we 've come to view the justice system as just another tool to push political agendas instead of the best way to determine truth and ensure justice\u2026 [ For example ] many liberals howled when Paul Manafort was given \u2018 only \u2019 four years in prison -- even though liberals have been fighting against mass incarceration and unduly long and harsh prison sentences\u2026\n\u201c Smollett should n't be top of mind , no matter whether he 's telling the truth or really staged a phony attack to boost his chances of getting a raise .
