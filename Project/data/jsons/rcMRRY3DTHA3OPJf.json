    "content": "Planned Parenthood asked reporters attending a happy hour for media professionals this week to abide by non-disclosure agreements , a request that can stifle reporters \u2019 ability to do their job .\nPlanned Parenthood later said that the request was a mistake , but it was the second time Planned Parenthood had asked me to sign a non-disclosure agreement . In 2018 , when I was signing up to cover the organization \u2019 s \u201c Power of Pink \u201d volunteer training in Detroit , I realized that the registration included signing an NDA that would restrict me from sharing \u201c confidential information . \u201d\nThat essentially included anything I learned \u201c through any means of communication or observation \u201d from anyone affiliated with Planned Parenthood , which has positioned itself as a bulwark against an administration that regularly attacks press credibility .\nAfter I pushed back on the NDA attached to the happy hour , scheduled for Wednesday , and said that I \u2019 d be writing a story about the organization \u2019 s use of the legal agreement for reporters , a Planned Parenthood staffer sent an email to all journalists registered for the event saying none of them would have to comply with an NDA . That email said the NDA , which was sent less than 48 hours before the happy hour and applied to anyone who showed up , was sent in error by a new employee .\nI \u2019 d pushed back on the NDA for the \u201c Power of Pink \u201d event , too . Initially , a Planned Parenthood staffer assured me that the agreement included \u201c allowances for journalists to report. \u201d They ultimately let me attend without agreeing to it , but it took a few days and the organization \u2019 s tech team had to build a special online backdoor to bypass that part of the registration .\nPlanned Parenthood told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News it is not their policy to require NDAs of reporters covering the organization .\nREAD : Planned Parenthood head says she was ousted in a \u2018 secret meeting \u2019\n`` Planned Parenthood is proud of the work we do to ensure that journalists and editors have access to the incredible staff , patients , services , and education that we provide , \u201d Erica Sackin , senior director of communications for Planned Parenthood Federation of America , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 News in an email . \u201c We pride ourselves on our transparency , and our support for freedom of the press as a pillar of our democracy . \u201d\nBut she did concede that the organization had asked reporters for NDAs , but characterized those request as mistakes .\n`` That said , our interactions with reporters around this have been less than perfect , '' Sackin said . `` It is not \u2014 and has not been \u2014 our official policy to require any reporter to sign an NDA that would prevent them from reporting an event we \u2019 re asking them to cover , or for informal off-the-record events . In instances when we have asked reporters to do so , it has been the result of miscommunication and misunderstanding between staff , or of staff members out of an abundance of caution enforcing rules that should not apply to journalists . \u201d\nPlanned Parenthood does generally ask non-journalists who attend its events to sign non-disclosure agreements , because it has very real privacy and security fears : The organization is public enemy number one in the eyes of abortion opponents , and it it has seen activists use fake identities to sneak into its gatherings .\nIn 2015 , after the anti-abortion Center for Medical Progress released videos of Planned Parenthood workers who \u2019 d been secretly filmed , Planned Parenthood was buffeted by accusations that it illegally sold parts of aborted fetuses for profit . Multiple congressional and state investigations found no evidence to support those allegations , and Planned Parenthood has said that the Center \u2019 s videos were deceptively edited . Last week , a federal jury in California awarded Planned Parenthood more than $ 2 million in damages in a case involving the videos .\nThe fallout also travelled far beyond courtrooms and the Capitol . The year the videos were released , abortion providers across the country reported receiving 94 death threats \u2014 up from just one in 2014 , according to the National Abortion Federation .\nREAD : Clinics are facing an impossible choice because of Trump 's 'gag rule '\n`` I completely understand why they 're doing it , \u201d said Jack Doppelt , a professor at Northwestern University \u2019 s Medill School of Journalism . \u201c They , I think , trust the media . They don \u2019 t trust the fake media . And they \u2019 ve been burned . ''\nBut , he added , \u201c That doesn \u2019 t mean that the journalist should be signing the non-disclosure agreements . \u201d\nReporters , including those at \u2588\u2588\u2588 News , regularly agree to conversations that are \u201c off the record \u201d or \u201c on background , \u201d meaning , respectively , that the journalists can \u2019 t print what they \u2019 ve learned or can only publish it without attribution . All of those negotiations can pose ethical dilemmas , according to Kathleen Bartzen Culver , director of the Center for Journalism Ethics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison . And asking reporters to sign NDAs before they attend events is also not unheard-of , particularly in the tech industry , Culver said .\nStill , these requests are uncommon . And agreeing to speak off the record is not the same as signing a legal document .\n\u201c It \u2019 s easier to punish someone , \u201d Culver said of NDAs . `` A reporter thinks , 'Ugh , I signed that NDA ; I 've got ta be extra careful , I \u2019 ve got ta be on the watch . ' It \u2019 s someone saying , \u2018 I have a tool of enforcement , \u2019 and then that may make you less courageous . ''\nJane Kirtley , director of the Silha Center for the Study of Media Ethics and Law at the University of Minnesota , agreed .\n\u201c Whether it \u2019 s an association like Planned Parenthood or a corporation , it \u2019 s just giving them the ability to essentially control the narrative , \u201d Kirtley told me of asking journalists to sign NDAs . \u201c Putting aside the legitimate concerns that they may have about subterfuge and so forth , for me , the bottom line is organizations like this can not expect the news media to essentially be an extension of their public relations arm . \u201d\nOn Wednesday morning , I called a Planned Parenthood staffer to say I wouldn \u2019 t be attending their happy hour that night with an NDA hanging over my head . They told me they \u2019 d look into it but that having attendees agree to NDAs was standard policy at all Planned Parenthood events .\nREAD : Planned Parenthood may lose tens of millions in funding on Monday thanks to the Trump administration\nThat \u2019 s also what I was told in 2018 , when I emailed a different Planned Parenthood employee , with whom I \u2019 d been speaking about attending the convention , and told them I felt uncomfortable signing the NDA .\nThe staffer promised to ask the legal team if I could get around it . But , they added , \u201c Our policy is to have all people who enter our event spaces people sign an NDA ( with allowances for journalists to report ) so we would need sign off from our legal department to register you without one . \u201d\nWhat does \u201c allowances for journalists to report \u201d mean ? I asked .\n\u201c I was just referring to the fact that [ the ] wording of the NDA does n't preclude journalists from speaking to folks on the record , \u201d the staffer said . \u201c It 's not written as such specifically for journalists , but there 's a section on rightfully receiving confidential information from a Third Party . \u201d\nWhen I asked \u2588\u2588\u2588 News ' lawyer for his help understanding the NDA \u2019 s restrictions , he told me that despite those reporting \u201c allowances , '' I would still likely not be able to report on any information I learned from Planned Parenthood staff or associates \u2014 a restriction that could drastically hinder my reporting . Both the NDA I saw in 2018 and the one this week include that language .\nTrevor Timm , executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation , said signing NDAs can have a chilling effect on journalists \u2019 speech .\n\u201c You wouldn \u2019 t know for sure if the information you heard from some third party , at this party , was covered .
