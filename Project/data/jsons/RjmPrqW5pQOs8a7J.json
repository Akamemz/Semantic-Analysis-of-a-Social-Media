Advertisers have subsequently pulled ads from NBC , and Kelly was dropped as the host for a Sandy Hook fundraiser .\nIn the preview , Kelly attempts to be tough with Jones , and accuses him of dodging her questions . She said in a statement that she interviewed him to \u201c shine a light \u201d on an increasingly important media figure . An NBC executive also defended the program , saying there was value in having Jones sit down for an interview .\nPOTUS 's been on & praises @ RealAlexJones ' show .

But a serious sit-down interview was a poor choice of format for covering him . It \u2019 s extremely difficult to have a reasonable exchange with a person who regularly rants and spews nonsense , as Jones does . It \u2019 s like running a straight one-on-one with a climate change denialist or someone who refuses to accept the Holocaust happened .\nJones doesn \u2019 t live in reality , and Kelly \u2019 s interview risks validating him and disseminating his bullshit . It doesn \u2019 t leave space for context and debunking .\nIt also sends the message that in an era of \u201c fake news \u201d and a president who regularly attacks the media , hoaxers like Jones are worthy of an hour of primetime TV to share their ideas .\nIf Jones \u2019 s words didn \u2019 t have dangerous real-world consequences , it wouldn \u2019 t matter much that he \u2019 ll soon have this megaphone . But they do \u2014 from spurring people to violent action to undermining institutions such as the media , science , and government .\nIf you \u2019 ve ever watched hours of Alex Jones \u2019 s Infowars , as I have , you might come away steeped in a dark and distorted view of the world . Jones alleges that 9/11 was \u201c an inside job , \u201d that the Sandy Hook massacre was designed to get Americans to side with gun control , and that there \u2019 s a secret fungus epidemic spreading across the country and slowly killing Americans .\nHe delivers these bizarre claims , and many others , red-faced , in his signature husky rasp . They \u2019 re framed as truths the mainstream media and elites are hiding from public view , with Jones as the bearer of the truth .\nThe president of the United States , meanwhile , has applauded Jones and perpetuated falsehoods that originated on the show , like the suggestion that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama started ISIS and that the election was rigged . Along with Breitbart and Fox News , Infowars was one of the keys sources of information for conservatives in the last election . ( The White House recently gave Infowars press credentials . )\nThis is one reason Jones \u2019 s audience is growing : Jones is now broadcast on some 150 radio stations , with a website that reaches more than 6 million unique US users each month and a YouTube channel that has more than 2 million followers \u2014 numbers that rival those of mainstream media outlets .\nBut his lies have also had real consequences for real people . The parents of the Sandy Hook victims have been harassed by \u201c Sandy Hook truthers \u201d spurred on by Jones . Even last week , a woman who claimed Sandy Hook is a hoax got five months in prison for threatening the father of a Sandy Hook victim .\nThere was also the so-called Pizzagate scandal late last year . Jones often talks about the pedophile rings that elites are helping to organize , and his suggestion that Clinton was running one out of a pizza restaurant in Washington , DC , was the reason a man walked into that shop with a gun last year threatening to kill people .\nIn April , Jones was entangled in another legal skirmish that once again demonstrates how seriously people take him .
