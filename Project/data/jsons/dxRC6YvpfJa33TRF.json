    "content": "Former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden , entertaining questions in an online chat Thursday from Moscow , called for global limits on surveillance but said , `` Not all spying is bad . ''\nHe also said he never stole colleagues ' logons or duped them to gain access to secret files detailing mass-surveillance programs .\n`` I never stole any passwords , nor did I trick an army of co-workers , '' he wrote during the live chat at the Free Snowden website , disputing a Reuters report in November as `` simply wrong . ''\nFielding questions submitted on Twitter for two hours , he also said U.S. laws governing whistle-blowers do not protect national security contractors and have `` so many holes '' that they make them ineffective and discourage reporting of abuses .\nThose laws also stand in the way of his returning from Russia , where he was granted temporary asylum last year after fleeing Hawaii and Hong Kong .\n`` Returning to the US , I think , is the best resolution for the government , the public , and myself , but it 's unfortunately not possible in the face of current whistleblower protection laws , which through a failure in law did not cover national security contractors like myself , '' he wrote in response to a question from Jake Tapper , CNN anchor and chief Washington correspondent .\nIn media interviews Thursday , Attorney General Eric Holder told MSNBC that prosecutors `` would engage '' with Snowden 's lawyers if `` their client was prepared to take accountability by pleading guilty to the charges filed against him . ''\n`` We would engage with his lawyers on that , as we would with any other defendant , '' Holder said .\nAt another appearance , Holder said : `` We 've always indicated that the notion of clemency is n't something that we were willing to consider . ''\nAsked about how the `` community of states '' should respond to mass surveillance , Snowden wrote , `` We need to work together to agree on a reasonable international norm for the limitations on spying . Nobody should be hacking critical-to-life infrastructure like hospitals and power stations , and it 's fair to say that can be recognized in international law .\n`` Additionally , we need to recognize that national laws are not going to solve the problem of indiscriminate surveillance . ''\nSnowden , whose revelations about U.S. surveillance practices created a global firestorm , held the chat on the Free Snowden website . It began at 3 p.m . ET and was to last one hour , but he said at 4 p.m. he would `` continue into overtime . ''\nHe ended the chat at 5 p.m. , urging participants to `` contact your members of congress and tell them how you feel about mass surveillance . This is a global problem , and the first step to tackling it is by working together to fix it at home . ''\nIn his final answer , Snowden said intelligence agencies `` do have a role to play , and the people at the working level at the NSA , CIA , or any other member of the IC are not out to get you . They 're good people trying to do the right thing , and I can tell you from personal experience that they were worried about the same things I was . ''\nHe added that the `` people you need to watch out for '' are the `` unaccountable senior officials authorizing these unconstitutional programs , and unreliable mechanisms like the secret FISA court , a rubber-stamp authority that approves 99.97 % of government requests . ''\nHe also said , `` Not all spying is bad , '' but added that the biggest problem now `` is the new technique of indiscriminate mass surveillance , where governments are seizing billions and billions and billions of innocents ' communication every single day . ''\n`` This is done not because it 's necessary \u2014 after all , these programs are unprecedented in U.S. history , and were begun in response to a threat that kills fewer Americans every year than bathtub falls and police officers \u2014 but because new technologies make it easy and cheap , '' Snowden said .\n`` I think a person should be able to dial a number , make a purchase , send an SMS , write an email , or visit a website without having to think about what it 's going to look like on their permanent record . Particularly when we now have courts , reports from the federal government , and even statements from Congress making it clear these programs have n't made us any more safe , we need to push back . ''\n`` The NSA and the rest of the US Intelligence Community is exceptionally well positioned to meet our intelligence requirements through targeted surveillance \u2014 the same way we 've always done it \u2014 without resorting to the mass surveillance of entire populations , '' Snowden added .\nHe dismissed U.S. whistle-blower protection laws as too weak to be effective .\n`` There are so many holes in the laws , the protections they afford are so weak , and the processes for reporting they provide are so ineffective that they appear to be intended to discourage reporting of even the clearest wrongdoing .
