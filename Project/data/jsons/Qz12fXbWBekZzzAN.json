The brief celebration of Trump \u2019 s selections was almost as loud as the otherwise daily denunciations of Trump himself . Trump \u2019 s equally inspired decisions , such as the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court and Jeff Sessions as attorney general , presented the same ironies .\nMost of these and other fine appointments came amid a near historic pushback against Trump , mostly over what he has said rather than what he \u2019 s done .

Indeed , removal chic is now widespread , as even conservatives ponder impeachment , invoking the 25th Amendment for mental unfitness , while the more radical ( here and abroad and both Right and Left ) either abstractly or concretely ponder a coup or some other road to his demise .\nHow do his opponents square such excellent appointments with Trump himself ? Even bad people can occasionally do good ?\nAre his Cabinet secretaries patriotically ( as I believe ) serving their president , even if prepared at times to nudge him away from what they might feel are occasional unwise detours ? Appointees of the caliber of a Mattis , McMaster , or Kelly do not go to work for any president with the likelihood of becoming undercover actors \u2014 undercutting his authority , or posing to the press that they are the moral superior to their boss , or leaking information to massage favorable accounts of their superior savvy or morality at the president \u2019 s expense .

So far , even the most vehement Trump censors have not faulted these fine appointees for supposedly being soiled by association with Trump , whom they have otherwise accused , in varying degrees , of partaking of fascism , Stalinism , and Hitlerism .\nAgain , the point is , How do critics square the circle of damning Trump as singularly unfit while simultaneously praising his inspired appointees , who , if they were to adopt a similar mindset , would never set foot in a Trump White House ?
