And I just don \u2019 t think Hollywood gets that . \u201d\nThe latest high-profile skirmish came Monday when actor Gary Sinise blasted former Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean \u2019 s declaration that ticket-buyers flocking to see the film are \u201c very angry \u201d tea party types .\n\u201c I bet you if you looked at a cross-section of the tea party and the people who go see this movie , there \u2019 s a lot of intersection , \u201d said Mr. Dean on HBO \u2019 s \u201c Real Time with Bill Maher . \u201d\nSEE ALSO : Gary Sinise to Howard Dean on \u2018 American Sniper \u2019 diss : \u2018 What the hell are you talking about ? \u2019\nMr. Sinise , an active supporter of veterans , swung back with a post on WhoSay informing Mr. Dean that he had seen the movie and \u201c would not consider myself to be an angry person . \u201d\n\u201c You certainly have a right to make stupid blanket statements , suggesting that all people who see this film are angry , but how is that helpful sir ? \u201d said Mr. Sinise , who stars in \u201c CSI : New York . \u201d\nThe movie , which tells the story of the late Navy SEAL Chris Kyle , a highly decorated sniper who served four tours of duty in Iraq , may actually be benefiting from the constant crossfire , said movie critic Christian Toto of the website Hollywood in Toto .\n\u201c I think you \u2019 ve got great word of mouth , and I think you \u2019 ve got a terrific film , \u201d Mr. Toto said . \u201c I think now it \u2019 s also going to have people , mostly on the right , who are going to say , \u2018 You know what ? To heck with those Michael Moore types , I want to go see this movie and support it because it speaks to my values . \u2019 \u201d\nShortly after the film \u2019 s release , Mr. Moore blasted military snipers as \u201c cowards , \u201d while Mr. Maher described the movie \u2019 s hero as \u201c a psychopath patriot and we love him. \u201d Actor Seth Rogen said on Twitter that the film reminded him of the Nazi propaganda film in \u201c Inglourious Basterds , \u201d but after the ensuing backlash released a statement saying he had not intended to offend anyone .\nThose leaping to the film \u2019 s defense include country singers Craig Morgan and Blake Shelton , Arizona Republican Sen.
