Honestly , I \u2019 ve been around this sort of talk , most of it at least half-joking , for most of my life . ( Years ago , I even affectionately parodied it . ) The people I \u2019 ve heard archly denounce whites have for the most part been upwardly-mobile people who \u2019 ve proven pretty adept at navigating elite , predominantly white spaces . A lot of them have been whites who pride themselves on their diverse social circles and their enlightened views , and who indulge in their own half-ironic white-bashing to underscore that it is their achieved identity as intelligent , worldly people that counts most , not their ascribed identity as being of recognizably European descent .\nOne reason I \u2019 ve been disinclined to take this sort of talk seriously in the past is that it has so often smacked of intra-white status jockeying . It is almost as though we \u2019 re living through a strange sort of ethnogenesis , in which those who see themselves as ( for lack of a better term ) upper-whites are doing everything they can to disaffiliate themselves from those they \u2019 ve deemed lower-whites . Note that to be \u201c upper \u201d or \u201c lower \u201d isn \u2019 t just about class status , though of course that \u2019 s always hovering in the background .

So why do they do it ? What work is this usually ( though not always ) gentle and irony-steeped white-bashing actually performing ?\nSome of this is just obvious edgelord trolling : the most transgressive thing you can get away with saying without actually getting called out for it . In this sense , it \u2019 s a way of establishing solidarity : All of us in this space get it , and we have nothing but disdain for those who do not . And some may well be intended as a defiant retort to bigotry .\nBut that doesn \u2019 t exhaust the universe of possibilities .
