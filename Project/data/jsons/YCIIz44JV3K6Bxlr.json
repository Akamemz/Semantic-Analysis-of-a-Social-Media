We aim for something loftier here .\nStill , the scene came to mind because there should be a similar rule in legal circles : \u201c Never Go Full Ninth Circuit. \u201d Personally , I think it sounds better in Latin : Nolite umquam ire plenus nona circuit ( and if any of you Latin pedants send me an e-mail correcting my translation , I will come to your house and scatter your Dungeons and Dragons figurines off the kitchen table ) .\nThe other day I noted on Special Report that Antonin Scalia had a rubber stamp on his desk with one of his favorite phrases : \u201c Stupid but Constitutional. \u201d I hope that one day , a Supreme Court justice will have a stamp on his desk that says , Numquam Plenus Nona Circuit .\nAnyway , I understand that the case against the Ninth Circuit can be exaggerated . Yes , the West Coast \u2019 s federal appellate court has the highest rate of cases that have been oveturned by the Supreme Court , but the vast majority of its cases don \u2019 t get appealed to the Supreme Court . Hence the qualifier \u201c Full Ninth Circuit. \u201d Going Full Ninth Circuit is when you claim that that the Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional .

Shall the commander-in-chief call to make sure he \u2019 s not interfering with anyone \u2019 s plan to take a few easy courses by day and smoke a lot of hash by night ?\nThe fancy lawyer guys I \u2019 ve talked to think the most egregious thing in the ruling is that the judges are concerned about the \u201c potential due process rights \u201d of illegal aliens . This calls to mind Socrates \u2019 famous query : \u201c Huh ? \u201d\nThe executive order is only aimed at people trying to enter the country . If you are an illegal immigrant already here , it has no bearing on you . If you are an illegal immigrant trying to enter or re-enter the United States \u2014 illegally ! \u2014 what are these due-process rights you \u2019 re talking about ?\nBut I think the craziest part of the ruling is the idea that a president \u2019 s campaign statements have legal weight and could violate the Establishment Clause of the Constitution . This is battier than Bruce Wayne \u2019 s home office .

He talked to his advisors and they said , \u201c You can \u2019 t do that. \u201d So he said , \u201c Okay , what can we do ? \u201d And they came up with this executive order . It was shoddily done and on the merits isn \u2019 t nearly as vital to American national security as he claims . But that \u2019 s my point .

Where does this retromingent line of legal reasoning end ?\nI firmly believe the Trump White House screwed the pooch on this thing from the get-go . By doing so , the president set in motion events that have made things even worse . The Ninth Circuit loves to preen under normal circumstances . The judges took a sloppily rolled out \u2014 but ultimately legal \u2014 executive order and used it to set potential precedents that , if left standing , will have calamitous repercussions .\nIf one thinks of the courts as a political institution with collective interests , the smartest thing the Ninth Circuit could have done is say something along the lines of \u201c this is stupid but constitutional. \u201d If they really think Trump is the monster the \u201c resistance \u201d Left thinks he is , they \u2019 ll need more , not less , credibility in the days to come . But , much like the mainstream media , they \u2019 ve decided that crying wolf from Day One is the preferable way to go . And that \u2019 s why they went Plenus nona circuit .\nFor those who haven \u2019 t been reading NR this week , what the Hell is wrong with you ?\nBut if you have a good excuse \u2014 e.g. , the hooker handcuffed you to a towel rack in a motel , you had heart-transplant surgery , a bear ate your face , etc . \u2014 you missed a lengthy and civil badinage about the question of nationalism and its role in American life . ( See , here , here , here , here , and here ) . I \u2019 m already running long so a lengthy recap is not in the cards . But , in brief : Rich Lowry and Ramesh Ponnuru penned an eloquent defense of nationalism qua nationalism in a cover story for the magazine . I modestly dissented , arguing that in America , nationalism is different from patriotism . I \u2019 m going to pick up where we left off below on the assumption you \u2019 re pretty much up to speed . If it \u2019 s not your cup of tea , that \u2019 s fine . I \u2019 ll see you next week ( when I pretend to be the cable guy ) .\nAs Rich Lowry is my boss \u2014 or at least one of them ( the perils of wearing many hats ) \u2014 let me start off by saying that not only is he a powerful man , but a handsome one , too .\nI should also say that I love these debates at NR , and it speaks well of him and the magazine that Rich encourages them .\nAnd now that I \u2019 ve blown enough sunshine up his nethers to earn a solar tax credit from the Obama administration , let \u2019 s get on with it .\nIndeed , the vast majority of expressions of American patriotism \u2014 the flag , the national anthem , statues , shrines and coinage honoring national heroes , military parades , ceremonies for those fallen in the nation \u2019 s wars \u2014 are replicated in every other country of the world . This is all the stuff of nationalism , both abroad and here at home .\nThis is at the same time both entirely right and fundamentally misleading . It leaves out what the flag represents . It glides over the fact that the national anthem sanctifies the \u201c land of the free. \u201d Our shrines are to patriots who upheld very specific American ideals . Our statues of soldiers commemorate heroes who died for something very different from what other warriors have fought and died for millennia . Every one of them \u2014 immigrants included \u2014 took an oath to defend not just some soil but our Constitution and by extension the ideals of the Founding . Walk around any European hamlet or capital and you will find statues of men who fell in battle to protect their tribe from another tribe . That doesn \u2019 t necessarily diminish the nobility of their deaths or the glory of their valor , but it is quite simply a very different thing they were fighting for .\nRich responds to this by writing like an angel on a cloud ( okay , now I \u2019 m really done with the up-sucking ) :\nIt is a charming characteristic of American nationalism to believe it isn \u2019 t and can \u2019 t possibly be nationalism \u2014 that is for other countries , not us . So Jonah seems to imply that other countries can \u2019 t have true patriotism because they don \u2019 t have the Declaration and our founding ideals . Their heroes honored with statues \u2014 I guess that means you , William of Orange , and you , Admiral Nelson , and you , Tadeusz Kosciuszko \u2014 were combatants in grubby wars of tribe versus tribe , as Jonah puts it . This is the equivalent of the New Yorker \u201c View of the World from 9th Avenue \u201d for world history , with the ideals and struggles for independence and self-government of others reduced to utter inconsequence .\nLike a mail-order Ikea entertainment center , this is going to require some unpacking before we can even get started .\nWhen Rich says , \u201c Jonah seems to imply that other countries can \u2019 t have true patriotism because they don \u2019 t have the Declaration and our founding ideals . . . \u201d you should translate that as , \u201c Rich seems to be inferring. \u201d I have no problem conceding that patriotism exists in other countries . Americans didn \u2019 t invent the word , after all .\nLet \u2019 s stipulate that patriotism means \u201c love of country. \u201d People all over the world love their countries . Even people who live under oppressive dictators and hate their governments will say that they love their country . Indeed , many of the greatest patriots swim against the nationalist tides in their homelands .\nLove is a quadrupedal , five-toed mammal with a prehensile trunk formed of the nose and upper lip . Oh wait , sorry that \u2019 s an elephant . Love is like a movie about randy underwear models locked up in a prison run by a buxom bisexual warden . No wait that \u2019 s not it either .\nI guess the point is that love , much like pornography and elephants , is hard to define , but most of us know it when we see it . But I think we can all agree that love is contextual . Love requires an object , and the nature of that object defines the nature of our love . I love my wife , my daughter , my dogs , and eating cold fried chicken over the kitchen sink \u2014 but I love all of these things in very distinct ways .\nI guess the point is that love , much like pornography and elephants , is hard to define , but most of us know it when we see it .\nLet me try it a different way . I have always believed that American conservatism is inseparable from American patriotism . I said \u201c inseparable from \u201d not \u201c identical to . \u201d\nSince everyone \u2019 s quoting Samuel Huntington these days , I \u2019 ll do it too . Huntington observed that conservatism is a \u201c positional ideology. \u201d By that he meant that there are many conservatisms because conservatives in different societies seek to conserve different things . A conservative in France in , say , 1788 seeks to conserve that rich bouillabaisse of altar and throne . A conservative in England seeks to conserve the monarchy , among other things .\n\u201c Men are driven to conservatism by the shock of events , \u201d Huntington wrote , \u201c by the horrible feeling that a society or institution which they have approved or taken for granted and with which they have been intimately connected may suddenly cease to exist. \u201d This is why I share Yuval Levin \u2019 s contention that , at its core , conservatism is gratitude .\nTo my mind , conservatism is gratitude . Conservatives tend to begin from gratitude for what is good and what works in our society and then strive to build on it , while liberals tend to begin from outrage at what is bad and broken and seek to uproot it .\nThis is why I had no problem saying that Barack Obama \u2019 s talk of \u201c fundamentally transforming \u201d America was literally unpatriotic . If patriotism is love , then wanting to fundamentally transform what you love isn \u2019 t really love . In speeches I used to tell married men , \u201c Go home tonight and tell your wives , \u2018 Honey , you know I love you . I just want to fundamentally transform you. \u2019 See how that works out for ya. \u201d Love requires loving something as it is , not for what it might be at your hands .\nPatriotism is also a positional orientation ( I \u2019 m a little reluctant to call it an ideology ) . A patriot in England , never mind Russia or Botswana , loves different things than a patriot in the United States . It \u2019 s something of a paradox : All patriotisms are equal in that they are all subjective , but not all patriotisms are equal when measured against certain ideals .\nAnd that makes all the difference in the world . Lowry asserts that I think other countries can \u2019 t have patriotism because they don \u2019 t love the Founding and our principles of liberty . Not at all ; rather , I think American patriotism is different because America \u2014 the object of our love \u2014 is different . As Hayek noted , America is the one place where you can be a lover of liberty and a conservative because in America conservatives seek to defend the liberal principles of the Founding .\nThis creates another paradox . The American colonists considered themselves English subjects and inheritors of an English tradition . But they were , quite obviously , not English nationalists . Indeed , they rebelled against the crown precisely because the inherent logic of nationalism \u2014 obey the crown , do as you \u2019 re told , abide by tradition \u2014 was in their eyes a violation of more important English principles that stretched back to the Magna Carta and beyond . The Founders took the arguments of Locke , Burke et al and followed them to their logical and glorious conclusion that ended up leaving the monarchy in the dustbin of ( American ) history .\nIn the nations of the Old World , nationalism is a tribal passion or sentiment that relies ( in theory ) on mystic and ancient myths of a shared ancestral past . Most of the foundational writers on nationalism , like Johann Herder , argued that nation and volk were literally like an ancient family . There \u2019 s no room to go into it here in any detail ( though I do at great length in my forthcoming book ) , but the idea that the nation is a family is a very pernicious one , conceptually ceding all manner of authorities to the state that it does not and must not have .\nIn America there is nationalist sentiment , to be sure , but the \u2018 doctrines \u2019 of nationalism find no easy purchase here .\nIn America there is nationalist sentiment , to be sure , but the \u201c doctrines \u201d of nationalism find no easy purchase here . Werner Sombart \u2019 s famous question , \u201c Why is there no socialism in America ? \u201d has elicited many answers , but the most agreed-upon one is that America has no feudal past . America represented a sharp break with the ancient notion that polities \u2014 nations , empires , city-states , tribes , etc . \u2014 were no different than families with an unimpeachable pater familias at the helm . We celebrated and enshrined very different notions in our national DNA , which is why Alexis de Tocqueville could observe that the American was the Englishman left alone . What makes America exceptional , what makes American patriotism and conservatism different , is that the object of our love and gratitude is different . If Rich wants to define nationalism as love of country and nothing more , that \u2019 s his right . But he would be wrong .\nSo when Rich tries to insinuate that I don \u2019 t think William of Orange was a patriot , he \u2019 s wrong . But his patriotism was fundamentally , philosophically , and morally different than American patriotism . And , by the way , it most certainly was tribal , if one is allowed some leeway when using the term . As he knows , England \u2014 and Europe \u2014 was cleaved in a vicious \u201c Cold War \u201d ( historian J. P. Kenyon \u2019 s phrase ) between protestants and Catholics . The Earl of Essex told the Privy Council in 1679 : \u201c The apprehension of popery makes me imagine that I see my children frying in Smithfield. \u201d To this day you can still find Irishmen who \u2019 ll say , \u201c I don \u2019 t care if I swing by a rope , down with King Billy and Up with the Pope ! \u201d\nIf you don \u2019 t want to call that tribalism , fine . But I think my point stands just fine . In America , we said goodbye to all that , and that \u2019 s made all the difference in the world .\nRich is a greater student of Abraham Lincoln than I \u2019 ll ever be ( \u201c Lowry , you magnificent bastard , I read your book ! \u201d ) . But I \u2019 ll risk his wrath by reminding him that Lincoln understood the exceptional nature of America as much as anyone . He was dismayed by the nationalist passions that trampled upon the patriot \u2019 s commitment to law and liberty . As he said in his Lyceum address :\n\u2010 \u201c I mean the increasing disregard for law which pervades the country ; the growing disposition to substitute the wild and furious passions , in lieu of the sober judgment of Courts ; and the worse than savage mobs , for the executive ministers of justice . \u201d\n\u2010 \u201c Thus , then , by the operation of this mobocractic spirit , which all must admit , is now abroad in the land , the strongest bulwark of any Government , and particularly of those constituted like ours , may effectually be broken down and destroyed \u2014 I mean the attachment of the People . Whenever this effect shall be produced among us ; whenever the vicious portion of population shall be permitted to gather in bands of hundreds and thousands , and burn churches , ravage and rob provision-stores , throw printing presses into rivers , shoot editors , and hang and burn obnoxious persons at pleasure , and with impunity ; depend on it , this Government can not last . \u201d\nLincoln recognized that the lust of nationalism was unhealthy and destructive unless it be channeled into the proper orientation of American patriotism .\n\u2010 \u201c As the patriots of seventy-six did to the support of the Declaration of Independence , so to the support of the Constitution and Laws , let every American pledge his life , his property , and his sacred honor ; \u2014 let every man remember that to violate the law , is to trample on the blood of his father , and to tear the character of his own , and his children \u2019 s liberty . \u201d\nLincoln recognized that the lust of nationalism was unhealthy and destructive unless it be channeled into the proper orientation of American patriotism .\nI should say that I agree entirely with Rich when he writes , echoing Huntington , \u201c When you lose our nation and common culture , you \u2019 re going to lose our creed , as well. \u201d Which is why I said that in a normal time our differences would be largely academic . My purely academic disagreement here is that talking about the burning need for more \u201c nationalism \u201d is not the best way to spark a recommitment to our nation and culture .\nAnd that brings me to our final disagreement . Rich is understandably perturbed by my closing paragraph :\nIn a normal time , I would still have the above disagreements ( and a few others I left out ) with Rich and Ramesh , but they would be entirely academic . But this is not a normal time , and the decision to slap a coat of paint over the term nationalism becomes difficult not to interpret as a whitewash . If the intent is to educate the president about what nationalism , rightly understood is , I wish them luck , but I won \u2019 t get my hopes up .\nRich fairly notes that his nationalism-rightly-understood project predates the current moment and his own tenure in the captain \u2019 s chair at NR . That is all fair . And if I had the chance to do it over I would rephrase that penultimate sentence to read : \u201c But this is not a normal time , and the decision to slap a coat of paint over the term nationalism makes it somewhat more difficult to defend it against the accusation that it is a whitewash . \u201d\nPolitics is about moments . We put \u201c under God \u201d in the Pledge in order to kick dirt on the shoes of Communists . Trent Lott said many times that America would have been better off if Strom Thurmond had been president and no one noticed or cared . And then they did . Choosing to rush to the defense of nationalism \u2014 no matter how rationally or defensibly \u2014 at a moment when mobocratic nationalism-improperly-understood is on the rise opens you up to the charge of being on the other side of the question . As I suggested in my initial response , I think that \u2019 s unfair and misguided . But it should also be expected .\nFirst off , if you haven \u2019 t signed up for the \u2588\u2588\u2588 Institute Ideas Summit ( March 16\u201317 ) , I really think you should . It looks like it will be the best one in a very long time even though \u2014 or perhaps because ! \u2014 I won \u2019 t be there . I have a family commitment I can \u2019 t get out of . I am quite dismayed about it . But if you \u2019 re interested in the prospects or plight of the conservative movement and you can make it , I don \u2019 t know why you wouldn \u2019 t go .\nCanine Update : The beasts are the beasts doing their strange beastlike and beastly things .

The judges took a sloppily rolled out \u2014 but ultimately legal \u2014 executive order and used it to set potential precedents that, if left standing, will have calamitous repercussions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf one thinks of the courts as a political institution with collective interests, the smartest thing the Ninth Circuit could have done is say something along the lines of \u201cthis is stupid but constitutional.\u201d If they really think Trump is the monster the \u201cresistance\u201d Left thinks he is, they\u2019ll need more, not less, credibility in the days to come. But, much like the mainstream media, they\u2019ve decided that crying wolf from Day One is the preferable way to go. And that\u2019s why they went Plenus nona circuit.\n\nNationalism, Again\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor those who haven\u2019t been reading NR this week, what the Hell is wrong with you?\n\nBut if you have a good excuse \u2014 e.g., the hooker handcuffed you to a towel rack in a motel, you had heart-transplant surgery, a bear ate your face, etc. \u2014 you missed a lengthy and civil badinage about the question of nationalism and its role in American life. (See, here, here, here, here, and here). I\u2019m already running long so a lengthy recap is not in the cards. But, in brief: Rich Lowry and Ramesh Ponnuru penned an eloquent defense of nationalism qua nationalism in a cover story for the magazine. I modestly dissented, arguing that in America, nationalism is different from patriotism. I\u2019m going to pick up where we left off below on the assumption you\u2019re pretty much up to speed. If it\u2019s not your cup of tea, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll see you next week (when I pretend to be the cable guy).\n\nAs Rich Lowry is my boss \u2014 or at least one of them (the perils of wearing many hats) \u2014 let me start off by saying that not only is he a powerful man, but a handsome one, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI should also say that I love these debates at NR, and it speaks well of him and the magazine that Rich encourages them.\n\nAnd now that I\u2019ve blown enough sunshine up his nethers to earn a solar tax credit from the Obama administration, let\u2019s get on with it.\n\nIn their cover story Rich and Ramesh wrote:\n\nIndeed, the vast majority of expressions of American patriotism \u2014 the flag, the national anthem, statues, shrines and coinage honoring national heroes, military parades, ceremonies for those fallen in the nation\u2019s wars \u2014 are replicated in every other country of the world. This is all the stuff of nationalism, both abroad and here at home.\n\nTo which I responded, in part:\n\nThis is at the same time both entirely right and fundamentally misleading. It leaves out what the flag represents. It glides over the fact that the national anthem sanctifies the \u201cland of the free.\u201d Our shrines are to patriots who upheld very specific American ideals. Our statues of soldiers commemorate heroes who died for something very different from what other warriors have fought and died for millennia. Every one of them \u2014 immigrants included \u2014 took an oath to defend not just some soil but our Constitution and by extension the ideals of the Founding. Walk around any European hamlet or capital and you will find statues of men who fell in battle to protect their tribe from another tribe. That doesn\u2019t necessarily diminish the nobility of their deaths or the glory of their valor, but it is quite simply a very different thing they were fighting for.\n\nRich responds to this by writing like an angel on a cloud (okay, now I\u2019m really done with the up-sucking):\n\nIt is a charming characteristic of American nationalism to believe it isn\u2019t and can\u2019t possibly be nationalism \u2014 that is for other countries, not us. So Jonah seems to imply that other countries can\u2019t have true patriotism because they don\u2019t have the Declaration and our founding ideals. Their heroes honored with statues \u2014 I guess that means you, William of Orange, and you, Admiral Nelson, and you, Tadeusz Kosciuszko \u2014 were combatants in grubby wars of tribe versus tribe, as Jonah puts it. This is the equivalent of the New Yorker \u201cView of the World from 9th Avenue\u201d for world history, with the ideals and struggles for independence and self-government of others reduced to utter inconsequence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike a mail-order Ikea entertainment center, this is going to require some unpacking before we can even get started.\n\nWhen Rich says, \u201cJonah seems to imply that other countries can\u2019t have true patriotism because they don\u2019t have the Declaration and our founding ideals . . . \u201d you should translate that as, \u201cRich seems to be inferring.\u201d I have no problem conceding that patriotism exists in other countries. Americans didn\u2019t invent the word, after all.\n\nLet\u2019s stipulate that patriotism means \u201clove of country.\u201d People all over the world love their countries. Even people who live under oppressive dictators and hate their governments will say that they love their country. Indeed, many of the greatest patriots swim against the nationalist tides in their homelands.\n\nLove is a quadrupedal, five-toed mammal with a prehensile trunk formed of the nose and upper lip. Oh wait, sorry that\u2019s an elephant. Love is like a movie about randy underwear models locked up in a prison run by a buxom bisexual warden. No wait that\u2019s not it either.\n\nI guess the point is that love, much like pornography and elephants, is hard to define, but most of us know it when we see it. But I think we can all agree that love is contextual. Love requires an object, and the nature of that object defines the nature of our love. I love my wife, my daughter, my dogs, and eating cold fried chicken over the kitchen sink \u2014 but I love all of these things in very distinct ways.\n\nI guess the point is that love, much like pornography and elephants, is hard to define, but most of us know it when we see it.\n\nLet me try it a different way. I have always believed that American conservatism is inseparable from American patriotism. I said \u201cinseparable from\u201d not \u201cidentical to.\u201d\n\nSince everyone\u2019s quoting Samuel Huntington these days, I\u2019ll do it too. Huntington observed that conservatism is a \u201cpositional ideology.\u201d By that he meant that there are many conservatisms because conservatives in different societies seek to conserve different things. A conservative in France in, say, 1788 seeks to conserve that rich bouillabaisse of altar and throne. A conservative in England seeks to conserve the monarchy, among other things.\n\n\u201cMen are driven to conservatism by the shock of events,\u201d Huntington wrote, \u201cby the horrible feeling that a society or institution which they have approved or taken for granted and with which they have been intimately connected may suddenly cease to exist.\u201d This is why I share Yuval Levin\u2019s contention that, at its core, conservatism is gratitude.\n\nTo my mind, conservatism is gratitude. Conservatives tend to begin from gratitude for what is good and what works in our society and then strive to build on it, while liberals tend to begin from outrage at what is bad and broken and seek to uproot it.\n\nThis is why I had no problem saying that Barack Obama\u2019s talk of \u201cfundamentally transforming\u201d America was literally unpatriotic. If patriotism is love, then wanting to fundamentally transform what you love isn\u2019t really love. In speeches I used to tell married men, \u201cGo home tonight and tell your wives, \u2018Honey, you know I love you. I just want to fundamentally transform you.\u2019 See how that works out for ya.\u201d Love requires loving something as it is, not for what it might be at your hands.\n\nPatriotism is also a positional orientation (I\u2019m a little reluctant to call it an ideology). A patriot in England, never mind Russia or Botswana, loves different things than a patriot in the United States. It\u2019s something of a paradox: All patriotisms are equal in that they are all subjective, but not all patriotisms are equal when measured against certain ideals.\n\nAnd that makes all the difference in the world. Lowry asserts that I think other countries can\u2019t have patriotism because they don\u2019t love the Founding and our principles of liberty. Not at all; rather, I think American patriotism is different because America \u2014 the object of our love \u2014 is different. As Hayek noted, America is the one place where you can be a lover of liberty and a conservative because in America conservatives seek to defend the liberal principles of the Founding.\n\nThis creates another paradox. The American colonists considered themselves English subjects and inheritors of an English tradition. But they were, quite obviously, not English nationalists. Indeed, they rebelled against the crown precisely because the inherent logic of nationalism \u2014 obey the crown, do as you\u2019re told, abide by tradition \u2014 was in their eyes a violation of more important English principles that stretched back to the Magna Carta and beyond. The Founders took the arguments of Locke, Burke et al and followed them to their logical and glorious conclusion that ended up leaving the monarchy in the dustbin of (American) history.\n\nIn the nations of the Old World, nationalism is a tribal passion or sentiment that relies (in theory) on mystic and ancient myths of a shared ancestral past. Most of the foundational writers on nationalism, like Johann Herder, argued that nation and volk were literally like an ancient family. There\u2019s no room to go into it here in any detail (though I do at great length in my forthcoming book), but the idea that the nation is a family is a very pernicious one, conceptually ceding all manner of authorities to the state that it does not and must not have.\n\nIn America there is nationalist sentiment, to be sure, but the \u2018doctrines\u2019 of nationalism find no easy purchase here.\n\nIn America there is nationalist sentiment, to be sure, but the \u201cdoctrines\u201d of nationalism find no easy purchase here. Werner Sombart\u2019s famous question, \u201cWhy is there no socialism in America?\u201d has elicited many answers, but the most agreed-upon one is that America has no feudal past. America represented a sharp break with the ancient notion that polities \u2014 nations, empires, city-states, tribes, etc. \u2014 were no different than families with an unimpeachable pater familias at the helm. We celebrated and enshrined very different notions in our national DNA, which is why Alexis de Tocqueville could observe that the American was the Englishman left alone. What makes America exceptional, what makes American patriotism and conservatism different, is that the object of our love and gratitude is different. If Rich wants to define nationalism as love of country and nothing more, that\u2019s his right. But he would be wrong.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo when Rich tries to insinuate that I don\u2019t think William of Orange was a patriot, he\u2019s wrong. But his patriotism was fundamentally, philosophically, and morally different than American patriotism. And, by the way, it most certainly was tribal, if one is allowed some leeway when using the term. As he knows, England \u2014 and Europe \u2014 was cleaved in a vicious \u201cCold War\u201d (historian J. P. Kenyon\u2019s phrase) between protestants and Catholics. The Earl of Essex told the Privy Council in 1679: \u201cThe apprehension of popery makes me imagine that I see my children frying in Smithfield.\u201d To this day you can still find Irishmen who\u2019ll say, \u201cI don\u2019t care if I swing by a rope, down with King Billy and Up with the Pope!\u201d\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to call that tribalism, fine. But I think my point stands just fine. In America, we said goodbye to all that, and that\u2019s made all the difference in the world.\n\nEt Tu, Abe?\n\nRich is a greater student of Abraham Lincoln than I\u2019ll ever be (\u201cLowry, you magnificent bastard, I read your book!\u201d). But I\u2019ll risk his wrath by reminding him that Lincoln understood the exceptional nature of America as much as anyone. He was dismayed by the nationalist passions that trampled upon the patriot\u2019s commitment to law and liberty. As he said in his Lyceum address:\n\n\u2010 \u201cI mean the increasing disregard for law which pervades the country; the growing disposition to substitute the wild and furious passions, in lieu of the sober judgment of Courts; and the worse than savage mobs, for the executive ministers of justice.\u201d\n\n\u2010 \u201cThus, then, by the operation of this mobocractic spirit, which all must admit, is now abroad in the land, the strongest bulwark of any Government, and particularly of those constituted like ours, may effectually be broken down and destroyed \u2014 I mean the attachment of the People. Whenever this effect shall be produced among us; whenever the vicious portion of population shall be permitted to gather in bands of hundreds and thousands, and burn churches, ravage and rob provision-stores, throw printing presses into rivers, shoot editors, and hang and burn obnoxious persons at pleasure, and with impunity; depend on it, this Government cannot last.\u201d\n\nLincoln recognized that the lust of nationalism was unhealthy and destructive unless it be channeled into the proper orientation of American patriotism.\n\n\u2010 \u201cAs the patriots of seventy-six did to the support of the Declaration of Independence, so to the support of the Constitution and Laws, let every American pledge his life, his property, and his sacred honor; \u2014 let every man remember that to violate the law, is to trample on the blood of his father, and to tear the character of his own, and his children\u2019s liberty.\u201d\n\nLincoln recognized that the lust of nationalism was unhealthy and destructive unless it be channeled into the proper orientation of American patriotism.\n\nI should say that I agree entirely with Rich when he writes, echoing Huntington, \u201cWhen you lose our nation and common culture, you\u2019re going to lose our creed, as well.\u201d Which is why I said that in a normal time our differences would be largely academic. My purely academic disagreement here is that talking about the burning need for more \u201cnationalism\u201d is not the best way to spark a recommitment to our nation and culture.\n\nThe Whitewash\n\nAnd that brings me to our final disagreement. Rich is understandably perturbed by my closing paragraph:\n\nIn a normal time, I would still have the above disagreements (and a few others I left out) with Rich and Ramesh, but they would be entirely academic. But this is not a normal time, and the decision to slap a coat of paint over the term nationalism becomes difficult not to interpret as a whitewash. If the intent is to educate the president about what nationalism, rightly understood is, I wish them luck, but I won\u2019t get my hopes up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRich fairly notes that his nationalism-rightly-understood project predates the current moment and his own tenure in the captain\u2019s chair at NR. That is all fair. And if I had the chance to do it over I would rephrase that penultimate sentence to read: \u201cBut this is not a normal time, and the decision to slap a coat of paint over the term nationalism makes it somewhat more difficult to defend it against the accusation that it is a whitewash.\u201d\n\nPolitics is about moments. We put \u201cunder God\u201d in the Pledge in order to kick dirt on the shoes of Communists. Trent Lott said many times that America would have been better off if Strom Thurmond had been president and no one noticed or cared. And then they did. Choosing to rush to the defense of nationalism \u2014 no matter how rationally or defensibly \u2014 at a moment when mobocratic nationalism-improperly-understood is on the rise opens you up to the charge of being on the other side of the question. As I suggested in my initial response, I think that\u2019s unfair and misguided. But it should also be expected.\n\nVarious & Sundry\n\nFirst off, if you haven\u2019t signed up for the National Review Institute Ideas Summit (March 16\u201317), I really think you should. It looks like it will be the best one in a very long time even though \u2014 or perhaps because! \u2014 I won\u2019t be there. I have a family commitment I can\u2019t get out of. I am quite dismayed about it. But if you\u2019re interested in the prospects or plight of the conservative movement and you can make it, I don\u2019t know why you wouldn\u2019t go.\n\nCanine Update: The beasts are the beasts doing their strange beastlike and beastly things.
