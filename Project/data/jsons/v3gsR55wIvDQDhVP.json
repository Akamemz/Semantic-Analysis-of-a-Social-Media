    "content": "Critics of the Iran deal believed the August congressional recess was their best chance to scuttle the nuclear accord , as wavering lawmakers returned home to angry protesters and a barrage of TV ads . The longer the deal hung out there , they figured , the worse it would be for President Barack Obama .\nOpponents of the Iran agreement \u2014 led by the powerful American Israel Public Affairs Committee , among others \u2014 are following through on pledges to spend $ 30 million-plus on a TV ad blitz and lobbying effort designed to whip up opposition to the measure . Republican leaders got a big lift from Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York when the Democratic leader-in-waiting came out against it . And opponents pounced when a secret deal with international inspectors that the GOP had long warned against was finally leaked , showing that Iran would be permitted to do its own sampling of a military site suspected of hosting past nuclear testing .\nThe anti-deal side also enlisted prominent former lawmakers , like ex-Democratic Sens . Joe Lieberman and Mary Landrieu , to head up opposition groups , ginned up letters from retired military leaders and sent well-connected donors and activists to personally meet with Democrats still on the fence .\nNone of it has worked . Instead , a parade of House and Senate Democrats \u2014 even in red states \u2014 came out in favor of the deal . That eight-figure TV ad campaign has moved few , if any , Democratic lawmakers , and dovish groups like MoveOn.org are experiencing a surprising victory .\n\u201c Conventional wisdom seemed to be as this dragged through August the benefit would accrue to opponents of the deal , \u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy ( D-Conn ) . \u201c That has simply not been the case . \u201d\nA planned Sept. 9 rally against the deal featuring Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz ( R-Texas ) , meanwhile , threatens to drive wavering Democrats into the yes column . Cruz has questioned whether Democrats \u201c value the lives and safety of millions of Americans more than they value partisan loyalty to the White House \u201d \u2014 a message not likely to play well with undecided Democrats .\nAIPAC also plans one final lobbying blitz before the planned mid-September vote on a resolution of disapproval of the Iran agreement , according to sources close to the group .\nWith momentum moving in Obama \u2019 s direction \u2014 on Sunday , Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley became the 31st Senate Democrat to endorse the Iran accord \u2014 the White House is now openly pushing to crush the resolution in the Senate . The hope is to prevent the resolution from ever reaching the president 's desk , but if it does get through Congress , a veto looks certain to be sustained . Obama needs just three of the 13 undecided Democratic senators remaining to side with him ; in the House , he appears to already have the votes to uphold a veto .\n\u201c I felt confident when we left [ for the August recess ] that we would have enough votes , '' said Rep. Jan Schakowsky ( D-Ill. ) , who is helping whip Democratic support . \u201c That \u2019 s only been amplified over August . \u201d\nSchakowsky said members of the \u201c core whip team \u201d for House Democrats backing the agreement \u2014 which includes Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( D-Calif. ) and Reps. Lloyd Doggett of Texas , David Price of North Carolina and Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut \u2014 went over their target list last week and \u201c feel very confident we \u2019 re going to have 146 votes to sustain a veto . \u201d\n\u201c House Democrats are meeting and listening to their constituents over the course of this month , and Leader Pelosi has been very pleased with the response from members , \u201d said Drew Hammill , Pelosi \u2019 s spokesman . \u201c As we come back into session , the leader will continue to be focused on getting members access to education and validation resources they require . \u201d\nPrivately , Republican aides acknowledge they are \u201c very close \u201d to losing any ability to block the deal , but those leading the pricey outside effort to bring down the deal refuse to concede defeat . They want , at least , to get six more Senate Democrats to agree to pass the disapproval resolution and delay implementation of the deal .\nOpponents are baffled that only 14 House Democrats and two Senate Democrats have sided with them . The polls are getting worse , Iranian leaders keep making impolitic comments and TV ads continue to hammer uncommitted lawmakers . What aren \u2019 t these Democrats seeing , they wonder ?\n\u201c Obviously , it \u2019 s a little frustrating . You look at members : Are they favoring a lame duck president and marching themselves , their party and their country off a cliff ? \u201d asked former Sen . Norm Coleman ( R-Minn. ) , whose American Security Initiative has spent $ 10 million opposing the deal . That 's double the amount invested by the liberal J Street group , the primary outside group funding ads in favor of the agreement .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a very strange disconnect now , which grows larger as every day goes by , between the way American people feel about the Iran agreement and the way members of Congress seem to feel , \u201d said Lieberman , an independent who caucused with the Democrats and is now an architect of several big-dollar , anti-deal campaigns . \u201c In public opinion , the high point was the day the agreement was announced . \u201d\nStill , rank-and-file Democrats never quite bought the notion of a public uprising against the agreement . Swing-vote senators scheduled few public events , denying opponents the chance to create embarrassing YouTube clips of them getting shouted down by protesters .\nOne such forum , held by Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin in West Virginia , was dominated by Iran deal opponents but ignored by local media , a Democratic source said . A week later , Manchin posted thetextof the Iran deal to his Facebook page , and those who posted comments in response overwhelmingly urged him to vote no . Yet Manchin is still leaning toward backing the agreement .\n\u201c Democrats who believe the American people like this bad deal are fooling themselves . For years to come , supporters will have to explain why they trusted the dangerous Iranian regime , \u201d said Emily Schillinger , a spokeswoman for House Speaker John Boehner .\nThen there \u2019 s the matter of who is leading the opposition .\nFor some time , the White House hoped a Republican would back the deal , perhaps Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona . That hasn \u2019 t happened , but Obama has gotten the next best thing : The most credible opponents have been relatively low-key in taking on the White House during the past few weeks , while Trump , Cruz and other GOP presidential candidates have used increasingly incendiary language to denounce the agreement . That 's only helped the White House , which has gone to great lengths to mollify nervous Democrats .\nFirmly isolated in a caucus he 's poised to lead in 2017 , Schumer isn \u2019 t whipping members to side with him on the Iran deal . One Republican who might have swayed his Democratic colleagues against the deal , Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker ( R-Tenn. ) , decided that 's outside his job description .\n\u201c Am I on the phone all day lobbying people ? No . I do n't view that as my role , \u201d Corker said in an interview . \u201c What I \u2019 m not doing is whipping people .
