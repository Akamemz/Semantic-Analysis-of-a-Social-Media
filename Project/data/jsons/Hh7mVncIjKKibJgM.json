In the third quarter , real GDP increased 3.1 percent . The downturn in real GDP in the fourth quarter primarily reflected downturns in private inventory investment , in federal government spending , in exports , and in state and local government spending that were partly offset by an upturn in nonresidential fixed investment , a larger decrease in imports , and an acceleration in PCE .\nA 22 % decline in federal military spending drove the economic contraction .

This marks the first time the American economy has shrunk since the end of the 2008 recession.\n\nReal gross domestic product -- the output of goods and services produced by labor and property located in the United States -- decreased at an annual rate of 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012 (that is, from the third quarter to the fourth quarter), according to the \"advance\" estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
