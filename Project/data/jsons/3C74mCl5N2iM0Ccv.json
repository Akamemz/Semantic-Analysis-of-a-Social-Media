Early indications are Ailes and Fox News have no interest in moderating their form of attack programming , the bare-knuckle brand celebrated in Zev Chafets ' new bio of the Fox News president , Roger Ailes : Off Camera .\nDubbed the \u201c Growth & Opportunity Project , \u201d the RNC 's laundry list of campaign failures urges the party to become more inclusive , tolerant and able to engage and persuade non-believers . Or to at least be able to not turn them off entirely with angry , absolutist rhetoric . \u201c On messaging , we must change our tone , \u201d the report concluded .\nRight now though , the Republican Party , riding a White House losing streak ( 2-4 since 1992 ) , has a massive messaging problem , thanks to Roger Ailes .\nAs Variety confirmed last year , \u201c the voice of Republican opposition throughout the Obama administration has been Fox News Channel , and the de facto leader of the GOP its chairman-CEO Roger Ailes . \u201d\nIt 's fitting that the RNC report , which represents a concerted effort by the GOP to turn the page on its losing ways , arrived the same week Ailes was busy taking his book-release star turn and presenting himself as a clarion voice of the conservative movement . Via the book we learned Ailes , when not making weird media references to Hitler and Stalin and comparing Islamic charities to terrorist organizations , dismissed America 's first black president is \u201c lazy \u201d liar who 's \u201c never worked a day in his life. \u201d ( Ailes was clumsily misrepresenting comments Obama had made about himself in a 2011 interview with Barbara Walters . ) Then in an interview with the Daily Beast , Ailes lashed out at another prominent African American , Van Jones , calling him a \u201c communist infiltrator \u201d who `` has one job , to stir up racism whether he can find it or not . ''\nSo yes , thanks to a curious bit of timing , this week nicely captures the two paths , or the two options , that lay before Republicans . There 's the \u201c Growth & Opportunity \u201d path of tolerance vs. the Roger Ailes path of divisiveness .\nBut Republicans are n't supposed to mention the Ailes conundrum . Instead , the Fox chief is like the crazy rich uncle who owns the fancy beach house where the dysfunctional family reunion is taking place ; nobody wants to disparage the patriarch . Or , to mix metaphors , Ailes is the elephant in the elephant 's room . So all week long there 's been a running conversation among Republicans about their messaging , yet there 's been virtually no public discussion about Ailes and Fox News , which own the GOP 's messaging .\nThere 's been little public acknowledgement that there can be no effective rebranding of the Republican Party if Ailes does n't sign off . Meaning , the GOP can turn itself inside out if it wants , but if Fox News , the self-appointed face and voice the GOP , does n't change , none of it matters because Fox will still be pounding home every negative stereotype that party leaders now want to erase . ( i.e . Antagonistic , paranoid , narrow minded . )\nThat 's the only approach Ailes knows : the phony Outrage Machine approach . ( Obama did what ? ! ) But it 's growing stale . In January , Fox logged its worst ratings since August 2001 . ( Ratings rebounded somewhat in February . ) Even some conservative pundits have grown bored of the Fox News model . It 's the decade-old model that features the same tired voices making the same tired claims .\nAs I asked two months ago , has the Fox phony Outrage Machine damaged the conservative movement ?
