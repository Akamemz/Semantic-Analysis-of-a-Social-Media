    "content": "[ singing ] In the days before the election , supporters of Benjamin Netanyahu roll up to a strip mall in the south of Israel . Miri Regev is a right-wing , Likud politician . She \u2019 s Netanyahu \u2019 s minister of culture . And tonight , she \u2019 s campaigning for his re-election . Reporter : \u201c How is this election different from the past election ? \u201d The comments start to upset someone in the crowd . His name is Murad , and he identifies as a Palestinian citizen of Israel . The past decade has been defined by the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu . In a country facing constant threats , many credit him for keeping Israel safe and strong . \u201c We will do what is necessary to defend our people and to defend our state. \u201d But now , he \u2019 s caught up in a corruption scandal and will almost certainly be indicted on charges of bribery and fraud . The polls are close , so we came here to listen to his supporters and understand why people are sticking with him . We \u2019 re on the Israel-Gaza border . Palestinians continue to protest against an Israeli blockade that has suffocated them , and the Israel Defense Forces are on high alert for violence and Hamas rockets . We visit nearby border communities in the south , where Netanyahu \u2019 s hardline stance makes him popular . Though his supporters are very diverse , this working-class area is a rock solid base for Likud . \u201c Did you play ? \u201d \u201c I played. \u201d Alon Dividi is the mayor of Sderot , a city less than a mile from the Gaza border . \u201c I believe that our prime minister , Benjamin Netanyahu , he \u2019 s the best man that we can get in this time . Because we see what he \u2019 s done with Iran . We \u2019 ve seen what he \u2019 s done with the economy of Israel . And we \u2019 ve seen the security in this area . Imagine down in Manhattan , every week , someone would send a rocket . What do you ask from Trump ? What do you ask from your president ? You will say , destroy them. \u201d [ cheering ] Even children here know an alarm means they have 15 seconds to get to safety . \u201c You can see we have a shelter , a lot of shelter. \u201d \u201c So , that \u2019 s a shelter. \u201d \u201c This is a shelter , and this is a shelter , and this is a shelter , and there we have a shelter . Four years ago , on Saturday evening , me and my family , we all live very close to here . And we start to hear the alarm system \u2014 Red Color . The rocket landed \u2014 you see the car ? \u201d \u201c The car at the check right there ? \u201d \u201c Yes , yes , yes . The rocket landed there. \u201d There \u2019 s a saying here : \u201c rak Bibi , \u201d which means \u201c only Bibi. \u201d For many , it means only Netanyahu can keep them safe . From the community of Netiv Ha \u2019 asara , you can see the fence separating Israel from Gaza . We visit the Tasa family . Like everyone here , they had to build something called a safe room in their home . \u201c So , you see ? \u201d Reporter : \u201c Oh , this is \u2014 \u201d \u201c And as you see , it \u2019 s very small . Every time I have a bomb or an alarm , I need to run here . But it \u2019 s not safe because we don \u2019 t have enough time . We have 15 seconds . And if I don \u2019 t \u2014 It \u2019 s not a real life , you know ? And this is our life . Some of us want peace , and a little bit of us , like me , don \u2019 t believe in peace . They want to kill us . They want to destroy us . They want \u2014 they want to kill Israel. \u201d Reporter : \u201c You don \u2019 t think peace is possible ? \u201d \u201c No. \u201d \u201c Possible ? \u201d \u201c Not for me. \u201d \u201c Not now . It \u2019 s possible , but not now . Now the Hamas is in Gaza , and you can \u2019 t go and do them peace. \u201d \u201c Hamas is Hezbollah , Hezbollah is Iran . Iran is my enemy . That \u2019 s it . For me , I don \u2019 t see a partner to have now peace . And Netanyahu is the only one for me that sees the same thing about them . Netanyahu \u2014 that \u2019 s it . For me , no one can replace him. \u201d \u201c What are some of the other issues for this election that are on your mind ? \u201d \u201c I don \u2019 t have. \u201d Reporter : \u201c This is the most important ? \u201d \u201c Of course. \u201d Every Israeli election has been about security , and many Israelis have trusted Netanyahu to keep them safe , which is why his main rival now wants to emphasize that he can be just as tough . Benny Gantz is a three-star general , who rose to the highest ranks of the Israeli military . [ applause ] And his campaign has highlighted the need for unity within the country . But to win a parliamentary majority and become prime minister of Israel , Gantz \u2019 s party is expected to form a coalition with parties well to his left . So , it \u2019 s not clear to some people here what his leadership would bring . Shiri Sapir cares about security . He leans left and believes in a peace process with a two-state solution . But in Netanyahu \u2019 s Israel , some consider him a traitor . \u201c I \u2019 m going to give my life in the next three years to the army . I \u2019 m going to be \u2014 maybe I \u2019 m going to get in Gaza . Am I a traitor ? How can you say that ? \u201d In many ways , this election is really a referendum on Netanyahu and the direction he \u2019 s taken the country . In this political campaign ad , Israel \u2019 s minister of justice mocked rising concerns about the erosion of democracy . \u201c Fascism. \u201d It went viral . Minister Ayelet Shaked \u2019 s New Right Party is more right than Netanyahu \u2019 s , but he will need her party to form a governing coalition .
