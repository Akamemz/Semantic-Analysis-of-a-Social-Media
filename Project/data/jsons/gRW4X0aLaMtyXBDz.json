Here is how Sandweg explains the legal justification for Obama 's infamous temporary-amnesty program :\nThe president is doing what every single law enforcement agency across the country does : Put in place rational priorities to ensure that limited resources are focused on the populations that pose the greatest threat to public safety and border security . Every single law enforcement agency in America struggles with the fact that their resources are not conditioned to cover every single violation of the law . What prosecutors and police chiefs have done for years is implement enforcement priorities . That \u2019 s what the president has done .\nSo Obama 's entire legal justification for his DACA program rests on the premise that a broad based invitation for illegal immigrants to apply for temporary amnesty ensures `` that limited resources are focused on the populations that pose the greatest threat to public safety and border security . ''\nBut we already know , for a fact , that DACA did the exact opposite . Instead of conserving limited resources , DACA stretched DHS capabilities and degraded its ability to enforce good congressionally approved immigration law .\nHow do we know this ? Well for starters , just look at the DACA application * which requires a $ 465 filing fee . If DACA is such a saver of DHS resources , then why is Obama charging generally cash-strapped illegal immigrants $ 500 ?\nMore importantly , we know from subsequent reporting that Obama underpriced the cost of administering his temporary amnesty program . The New York Times reports :\nMany thousands of Americans seeking green cards for foreign spouses or other immediate relatives have been separated from them for a year or more because of swelling bureaucratic delays at a federal immigration agency in recent months .\nThe long waits came when the agency , Citizenship and Immigration Services , shifted attention and resources to a program President Obama started in 2012 to give deportation deferrals to young undocumented immigrants , according to administration officials and official data . \u2026\nUntil recently , an American could obtain a green card for a spouse , child or parent \u2014 probably the easiest document in the immigration system \u2014 in five months or less .
