Brian Kemp is pushing one of the most aggressive reopening plans in the United States . Barbershops , gyms and nail salons were allowed to reopen Friday , and dine-in restaurant service and movie screenings were freed to resume Monday \u2014 despite warnings that , without sufficient testing , the state could see a surge in infections .\nEven there , though , life was far from normal .
