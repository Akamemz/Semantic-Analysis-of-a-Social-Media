    "content": "In the clever science fiction video game Bioshock , an Objectivist business magnate named Andrew Ryan ( recognize those initials ? ) creates an underwater city , where the world 's elite members can flourish free from the controls of government . It is a utopian village that Ayn Rand and her hero John Galt would surely approve of , but unfortunately it ends up becoming a dystopian nightmare after class distinctions form ( what a shocker ) and technological innovation gets out of hand . It was a hell of a video game , for those of you into that kind of thing .\nBut I don \u2019 t bring up Bioshock to talk about video games . I bring it up because there is currently a similar movement happening in real life , and it is being funded by another rather eccentric businessman , the Paypal billionaire Peter Thiel . As some may already know , Thiel has teamed up with the grandson of libertarian icon Milton Friedman , Patri Friedman , to try and develop a \u201c seastead , \u201d or a permanent and autonomous dwelling at sea . Friedman formed the \u201c Seasteading Institute \u201d in 2008 , and Thiel has donated more than a million dollars to fund its creation .\nIt is all very utopian , to say the least . But on the website , they claim a floating city could be just years away . The real trick is finding a proper location to build this twenty-first century atlantis . Currently , they are attempting to find a host nation that will allow the floating city somewhat close to land , for the calm waters and ability to easily travel to and from the seastead .\nThe project has been coined \u201c libertarian island , \u201d and it reveals a building movement within Silicon Valley ; a sort of free market techno-capitalist faction that seems to come right out of Ayn Rand 's imagination . And as with all utopian ideologies , it is very appealing , especially when you live in a land where everything seems possible , with the proper technological advancements .\nTech billionaires like Thiel , Travis Kalanick and Marc Andressen , are leading the libertarian revolution in the land of computers , and it is not a surprising place for this laissez faire ideology to flourish . Silicon Valley is generally considered to have a laid back Californian culture , but behind all of the polite cordialities , there rests a necessary cutthroat attitude . A perfect example of this was Steve Jobs , who was so revered by the community , and much of the world , yet almost psychopathically merciless . The recent anti-trust case against the big tech companies like Google , Apple , and Intel , who colluded not to recruit each others employees , has even lead to speculation as to whether Jobs should be in jail today , if he were still alive .\nSo while Silicon Valley is no doubt a socially progressive place ( i.e . gay marriage ) , if one looks past social beliefs , there is as much ruthlessness as you \u2019 d expect in any capitalist industry . Look at the offshore tax avoidance , the despicable overseas working conditions , the outright violations of privacy and illegal behavior . There is a very real arrogance within Silicon Valley that seems to care little about rules and regulations .\nLibertarianism preaches a night-watchmen government that stays out of businesses way , and allows private industries to regulate themselves . It is a utopian ideology , as was communism , that has an almost religious-like faith in the free market , and an absolute distrust of any government . It is a perfect philosophy for a large corporation , like Apple , Google or Facebook . If we lived in an ideal libertarian society , these companies would not have to avoid taxes , because they would be non-existent , and they wouldn \u2019 t have to worry about annoying restrictions on privacy . In a libertarian society , these companies could regulate their own actions , and surely Google , with their famous \u201c Don \u2019 t be evil \u201d slogan , believes in corporate altruism .\nIn the Valley , innovation and entrepreneurship is everything , so a blind faith in the market is hardly shocking . And last year one of the leading libertarians , Rand Paul , flew out to San Francisco to speak at the Lincoln Labs Reboot Conference , held to \u201c create and support a community of like-minded individuals who desire to advance liberty in the public square with the use of technology. \u201d Paul said at the conference , \u201c use your ingenuity , use your big head to think of solutions the marketplace can figure out , that the idiots and trolls in Washington will never come up with , '' surely earning laughs and pats on the back .\nRand Paul has had one on one meetings with Mark Zuckerberg , and the floating island billionaire himself , Peter Thiel . The founder and CEO of Uber , Travis Kalanick is another noted libertarian , who used to have the cover of Ayn Rand \u2019 s \u201c The Fountainhead \u201d as his twitter icon . Kalanick runs Uber just as a devoted follower of Ayn Rand would , continuously fighting regulators and living by what writer Paul Carr has called the \u201c cult of disruption. \u201d Carr nicely summarizes the philosophy of this cult : \u201c In a digitally connected age , there \u2019 s absolutely no need for public carriage laws ( or hotel laws , or food safety laws , or\u2026 or\u2026 ) because the market will quickly move to drive out bad actors . If an Uber driver behaves badly , his low star rating will soon push him out of business . \u201d\nSo basically , with the internet , regulation has become nothing more than a outdated relic of the past , and today consumers truly have the power to make corporations behave by speaking out on social media , or providing negative ratings on Yelp , or filing a petition on Change.com , etc . It is the same old libertarian argument wrapped up in a new millennial cloak , that corporations will act ethically because if they don \u2019 t , consumers will go elsewhere .\nAs usual , it leaves out important realities that don \u2019 t sit well with the self-regulation myth . These realities include the irrationality and apathy of consumers , the lack of information available to consumers , and the overall secretive nature of corporations . The problem with self-regulation is that , consumers do not know what goes on at a corporation behind closed doors , so how would they force a company to act ethically if they are not aware of their misdeeds . Had the government not gone after Google for privacy violations , users would have never known . Google and other tech companies have a constant crave for innovation over everything , and bypass things like privacy when they get in its way . Would they control themselves had the government not stepped in ?\nAnother important truth is that many consumers usually continue willfully using products , even if a company has done something that is contrary to their moral beliefs . It is a sort of hypocritical selfishness where one puts comfort or convenience over ethics . Just look at Apple : everyone is aware of the appalling factory conditions and the tax avoidance , but that doesn \u2019 t stop many people from buying the latest iPhone .\nWhen looking at other industries , like oil and gas , the myth of self-regulation is even more comical . The famous oil billionaire Koch brothers , who are also fanatic libertarians , have knowingly avoided regulations , and have hurt people in the process . During the nineties , they were particularly careless , and the bottom line influenced every decision . When pipelines were in bad shape , they would determine whether fixing them or leaving them , and possibly paying off a lawsuit in the future , was more profitable . In 1996 , a pipeline that had been given the second treatment leaked butane into the air , and killed two teenagers who ignited it with the spark of their car ignition .\nEven if the consumers were completely rational and had access to all information , would it really be worth it to wait for companies to abide ? For example , many libertarians argue that legislation that made seat belts and airbags mandatory in all vehicles was pointless , because the free market would have eventually brought them anyways . But even if this were true , how long would it take , and how many lives could this inaction have caused ?\nThe most damning evidence against the myth of self regulation may very well be history .
