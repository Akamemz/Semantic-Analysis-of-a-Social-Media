One organizer of gay marriage opponents warned that their displeasure could spread to 32 other states where voters have banned gay marriage .\n`` Target is attacking traditional marriage , which is an incredibly misguided thing for them to have done , '' said Chuck Darrell , spokesman for Minnesota for Marriage , a group campaigning to pass the constitutional marriage amendment . `` It 's an insult to the overwhelming majority of their customers . ''\nTarget 's move comes two years after it endured a backlash from gay rights supporters for giving $ 150,000 to a campaign group backing the conservative Republican candidate for Minnesota governor , Tom Emmer , who narrowly lost to Democrat Mark Dayton in a race that went to an automatic recount . The donation set off protests and calls for a boycott from a constituency that had seen Target as an ally .\nSupporters of gay marriage see Minnesota as having the potential to halt their long losing streak in statewide votes .\nThe T-shirt promotion will raise up to $ 120,000 for the Family Equality Council , a Washington-based group that is part of a Minnesota coalition pushing to defeat the constitutional amendment .
