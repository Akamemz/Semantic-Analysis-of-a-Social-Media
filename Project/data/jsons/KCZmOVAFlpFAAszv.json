    "content": "Hurricane Harvey is pummeling Texas with one of the worst storms in recent American history this weekend , threatening businesses , homes , and lives with catastrophic flooding and storm surge . For many Americans , one question looms : How will President Trump , whose administration has been engulfed in chaos since Day One , manage it ?\nI study emergency management , and I \u2019 ve begun to assess the same question , placing this White House in a long history of presidential response to disasters .\nMajor natural disasters often last just moments or days , but the recovery can take years . The test of leadership is not measured in tweets , but in the tedium of making government resources work on behalf of people suffering .\nDespite the limited operational role of the president , a disaster response is their responsibility in the eyes of the public , and they typically use it to demonstrate leadership , compassion , and clear communication .\nOn Friday night , when a reporter asked him for a message for Texas , he replied , \u201c Good luck to everybody. \u201d Which certainly does not inspire much confidence in his ability to take this seriously .\nBut whatever Trump says or does with regard to the hurricane while it \u2019 s still unfolding matters far less than what he says or does in the coming weeks . It \u2019 s the recovery where his leadership will matter most .\nIt \u2019 ll be tempting to gauge Trump by his social media impact . But the real test is in his work over the long haul . Here are five things to watch for to see how well he \u2019 s responding as a president .\nHurricane Harvey is not a surprising disaster . A Category 4 storm hitting the Texas coast is a well-considered scenario . Every indication suggests state and local resources will be overwhelmed and this will be a major disaster requiring extensive federal resources .\nOn Friday night , Trump signed the Presidential Disaster Declaration , per the request of Texas Governor Greg Abbott , opening up access to federal resources . Over the next few days we should expect to see regular updates from the White House , in coordination with FEMA , about the status of response efforts including evacuations , sheltering , search and rescue , and significant damages .\nTrump has completed the most important job he has for right now , signing the Texas declaration . During a disaster , at the request of the governor and recommendation from FEMA , the president can declare a disaster under the Stafford Act . Doing so opens up federal resources and aid to assist state and local governments .\nTraditionally the president uses their platform to emphasize important lifesaving information and direct attention towards state and local officials . Then we \u2019 d expect to see a visit from the president to the coast , regular updates from federal agencies about the status of recovery , and discussion of how the federal government will financially contribute to recovery efforts .\nThe person who is arguably more important at a federal level during the response to a disaster is the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) administrator . Currently , unlike several other federal agencies , FEMA is staffed and has a qualified administrator , Brock Long . Long was appointed by Trump in April and confirmed in June . He has an extensive background in emergency management and , because he comes from Alabama , experience with hurricanes . The general consensus is the Long is a respectable choice .\nThe importance of appointing an individual with actual emergency management was made clear during Katrina when FEMA was led by Michael Brown , who had no emergency management experience . Since 2005 , presidents , including Trump , have made sure that the FEMA administrator is qualified . FEMA in 2017 is very different from FEMA in 2005 , thanks in large part to efforts taken during the Obama administration .\nJudging from the public communication put out by FEMA so far it seems that they are operating in a way that is similar to how they would have operated during a response under Obama .\nDespite the limited operational role of the president , a disaster response easily becomes their responsibility , and they typically use their role to demonstrate leadership , compassion , and clear communication . There is certainly something to be said to turn on your TV and see the president assuring us that the full resources of the United States government are addressing the disaster .\nBush was largely praised for his leadership in the days immediately following 9/11 . A few years later his leadership came under fire with the disastrous response to Hurricane Katrina and the New Orleans levee failure . Both disasters ended with major policy changes that reshaped emergency management across the country .\nIn responding to the many disasters during his tenure \u2014 such as Ebola , the BP oil disaster , and Superstorm Sandy \u2014 Obama committed to listening to his advisors and providing them with the resources they needed to respond . Response and recovery rarely , if ever , go perfectly . But the Obama administration certainly made an effort to analyze mistakes and do better next time . Nonetheless there were criticisms made related to optics \u2014 for instance when he went on vacation during the 2016 Louisiana floods .\nDespite concerns about the federal government it is worth remembering that the majority of disaster response occurs at the state and local levels .

Survivors are rarely helpless during disasters . They self-organize , form groups , and improvise throughout the response and recovery to address their needs .\nSome actions taken by Trump today are unusual compared to previous presidents . On Friday he tweeted a video of his tour of FEMA headquarters earlier this month that said , \u201c The U.S.A is the most resilient nation on earth , because we plan ahead .

Currently, unlike several other federal agencies, FEMA is staffed and has a qualified administrator, Brock Long. Long was appointed by Trump in April and confirmed in June. He has an extensive background in emergency management and, because he comes from Alabama, experience with hurricanes.

And then there was the \u201cgood luck\u201d tweet on Friday.\n\n5) Preparing for the next disaster\n\nThe majority of the work of emergency management happens long before a disaster happens and in the years after a disaster occurs.
