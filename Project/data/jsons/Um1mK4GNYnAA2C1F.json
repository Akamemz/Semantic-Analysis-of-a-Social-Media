    "content": "Longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone was arrested in connection with special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s investigation early Friday morning at his home in Florida . He was indicted for obstruction , making false statements , and witness tampering . You can read the full indictment at this link .\nThe charges focus on Stone \u2019 s alleged lies to the House Intelligence Committee during 2017 about his statements about and efforts to get in touch with WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign . The indictment also conspicuously mentions that \u201c a senior Trump campaign official was directed to contact Stone \u201d about what WikiLeaks might have on Hillary Clinton .\nThe indictment does not , however , attempt to explain why Stone would lie about this or lay out a definitive story about what did happen between Stone and WikiLeaks back then . Stone also has not been charged with any criminal activity occurring during the campaign .\nThe hacking and leaking of Democrats \u2019 emails has long been a central part of the Mueller investigation . Mueller has charged several Russian intelligence officers with the hacking . Eventually , WikiLeaks posted many of these emails publicly \u2014 the Democratic National Committee \u2019 s in July 2016 , and Clinton campaign chair John Podesta \u2019 s in October 2016 .\nRelated See the moment Roger Stone was arrested by the FBI\nVarious statements by Stone , including many public ones , raised questions about whether he had some sort of inside knowledge about WikiLeaks or its plans . He has denied having any such knowledge \u2014 and claimed that anything he knew about WikiLeaks came through an intermediary , radio host Randy Credico .\nNow Stone has been accused of lying about this to the House Intelligence Committee in 2017 , and trying to tamper with a witness \u2014 Credico \u2014 so that he would stick to that false story .\nA longtime GOP operative whose reputation for dirty tricks reaches all the way back to Richard Nixon \u2019 s 1972 reelection campaign , Stone has been an on-and-off adviser to Trump since the mid-1980s . That same decade , Stone also co-founded a famous lobbying firm with Paul Manafort .\nWhen Trump finally did end up running for president in 2015 , Stone was part of his initial campaign team . He only lasted a little over a month , though \u2014 Stone departed the operation in early August after clashing with other staffers . However , he remained in Trump \u2019 s orbit and , to some extent , in communication with the candidate himself afterward . In fact , he helped engineer Manafort \u2019 s hiring on the campaign .\nAs the 2016 general election neared , Stone frequently spoke about the hacks and leaks of Democratic emails and other documents . In August , he praised \u201c Guccifer 2.0 , \u201d the online persona taking responsibility for hacking the DNC ( Russian intelligence officers reportedly run the account ) . He also claimed that he had \u201c communicated \u201d with Julian Assange , the founder of WikiLeaks , which had posted the DNC emails . And he repeatedly hinted over the next two months that more damaging Clinton material was coming .\nOnly after the election , though , did we start learning more details about his private communication with both entities .\nRoger Stone surreptitiously communicated with both Guccifer 2.0 and WikiLeaks\nThe new indictment claims that after July 22 , 2016 , \u201c a senior Trump Campaign official was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases and what other damaging information \u201d WikiLeaks \u201c had regarding the Clinton Campaign . \u201d\nAround this time \u2014 in late July and early August 2016 \u2014 Stone also had a set of communications with conservative author Jerome Corsi , regarding getting in contact with Assange .\nOn July 25 , 2016 , Stone emailed Corsi , telling him to \u201c get to \u201d Assange in the \u201c Ecuadorian Embassy in London and get the pending \u201d WikiLeaks \u201c emails . \u201d\nOn July 31 , 2016 , Stone wrote to Corsi that Ted Malloch , a Trump campaign adviser , \u201c should see \u201d Assange .\nOn August 2 , 2016 , Corsi emailed Stone claiming knowledge of Assange \u2019 s plans . \u201c Word is friend in embassy plans 2 more dumps . One shortly after I \u2019 m back [ from a trip in Europe ] . 2nd in Oct. Impact planned to be very damaging .. \u201d Corsi continued : \u201c Would not hurt to start suggesting HRC old , memory bad , has stroke \u2014 neither he nor she well . I expect that much of next dump focus , setting stage for [ Clinton ] Foundation debacle . \u201d\nNot long afterward , on August 4 , Stone emailed fellow ex-Trump adviser Sam Nunberg , \u201c I dined with Julian Assange last night. \u201d ( When the email became public long afterward , Stone said this was just a joke . )\nThe day after that email , on August 5 , Stone penned a Breitbart article in which he took Guccifer \u2019 s story about being a lone hacker who stole the DNC emails at face value and argued that Russia probably wasn \u2019 t responsible . He also tweeted that \u201c Julian Assange is a hero . \u201d\nThree days later , on August 8 , Stone started publicly claiming to have inside information . \u201c I actually have communicated with Assange , \u201d he said . \u201c I believe the next tranche of his documents pertain to the Clinton Foundation but there \u2019 s no telling what the October surprise may be . \u201d\nA few days after that , Stone began tweeting at , and eventually DMing with , Guccifer 2.0 ( who , again , has reportedly been identified as a Russian intelligence officer ) . Some of these DMs later leaked , leading Stone to post what he claimed was their full exchange . But the posted messages were mainly friendly chitchat and not particularly substantive . ( They are not mentioned in the new indictment . )\nOn August 21 , Stone tweeted an odd prediction : \u201c Trust me , it will soon the Podesta \u2019 s time in the barrel . # CrookedHillary . \u201d\nMany would later point to this \u2014 which came months before the Podesta emails became public \u2014 and ask whether Stone had advance knowledge of the Podesta email leak . ( Stone himself would later claim that since this came in the midst of a scandal surrounding Stone \u2019 s old friend Paul Manafort \u2019 s Ukraine work , he was merely predicting \u201c Podesta \u2019 s business dealings would be exposed . \u201d )\nAs October began , Stone took on a new role \u2014 as WikiLeaks \u2019 hype man . He again claimed inside knowledge , saying a \u201c friend \u201d of his met with Assange and learned \u201c the mother lode is coming Wednesday. \u201d He tweeted : \u201c Wednesday @ HillaryClinton is done . # Wikileaks. \u201d And when nothing came on Wednesday , Stone tweeted , \u201c Libs thinking Assange will stand down are wishful thinking . Payload coming . # Lockthemup. \u201d Assange published the Podesta emails two days later .\nImmediately , there were questions about whether the garrulous operative had been involved , which eventually spurred WikiLeaks to tweet that the group \u201c has never communicated with Roger Stone. \u201d The Atlantic later reported that Stone DMed the WikiLeaks Twitter account afterward , complaining that they were \u201c attacking \u201d him . \u201c The false claims of association are being used by the democrats to undermine the impact of our publications , \u201d WikiLeaks responded . \u201c Don \u2019 t go there if you don \u2019 t want us to correct you. \u201d Stone shot back : \u201c Ha ! The more you \u2018 correct \u2019 me the more people think you \u2019 re lying . Your operation leaks like a sieve . You need to figure out who your friends are . \u201d\nStone is actually being charged for his alleged efforts to obstruct the investigation\nThe actual charges against Stone , however , don \u2019 t allege that he committed any crimes during the 2016 campaign . They allege , instead , that he attempted to obstruct investigations into what happened afterward .\nBy 2017 , Stone was putting forward an apparent cover story for whatever actually did happen in 2016 . He was insisting that everything he heard about Assange and WikiLeaks came from just one person \u2014 talk radio host Randy Credico , whom he called his \u201c intermediary . \u201d\nSo when Stone went to testify before the House Intelligence Committee in closed session in September 2017 , he stuck to that story . Mueller has indicted Stone on five counts of false statements during that testimony .\nStone was also charged with witness tampering for his efforts to get Credico to stick to his false story . \u201c \u2018 Stonewall it . Plead the fifth . Anything to save the plan \u2019 ... Richard Nixon , \u201d Stone texted Credico at one point . \u201c If you turned over anything to the FBI you \u2019 re a fool , \u201d he later said .\nAnd eventually , when Credico wouldn \u2019 t stick to the story , Stone got angrier . \u201c You are a rat . A stoolie . You backstab your friends , \u201d he wrote to Credico in April 2018 .\nOverall , the indictment makes the case that Stone was lying about the topic of WikiLeaks , but it does not seem to tell a full story about did happen between Stone , WikiLeaks , and the various intermediaries in 2016 .\nThere \u2019 s ample documentary evidence presented to make the case that Stone \u2019 s story about Credico being his only contact with Assange was indeed false . And there are allusions to what Stone was allegedly telling top members of the Trump campaign about WikiLeaks \u2019 plans .\nBut it does not read as any sort of final effort from prosecutors to sum up what did happen back then . That could still come later \u2014 or perhaps they don \u2019 t have sufficient evidence to show it .\nYou can read the full indictment below , or at this link .",
