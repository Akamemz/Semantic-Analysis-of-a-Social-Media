    "content": "There is no serious legal case for the Supreme Court to eliminate subsidies for health plans on federally facilitated health insurance exchanges . This has been written many , many times already , and the New York Times ' Supreme Court columnist Linda Greenhouse makes it in stark detail today . It would go against everything the conservative Supreme Court justices have written before about statutory interpretation .\n`` To reject the government \u2019 s defense of the law , '' Greenhouse writes , `` the justices would have to suspend their own settled approach to statutory interpretation as well as their often-stated view of how Congress should act toward the states . '' She then addresses the conservative justices who would take Obamacare 's soul : `` If you do , and you proceed to destroy the Affordable Care Act nonetheless , you will have a great deal of explaining to do \u2014 not to me , but to history . ''\nWell , the conservative justices who comprise a 5-4 majority on the Supreme Court probably do not care that much for the warnings of Linda Greenhouse of the New York Times . As she well knows . They have their own history to make , after all , and that is a political one : gutting the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act while they have the chance . I would like to believe that they 're thinking about this in anything but political terms , but it 's doubtful , because they 're well-established political hacks . The Democratic and Republican parties understand that they 're political hacks , too , and it makes sense to play to that side of them .\nThe decision likely comes down to John Roberts , again . Roberts , much to the enmity of his fellow conservative justices , upheld the individual mandate in 2012 . Even if he did n't go full-hack , this was not a neutral , balls-and-strikes reading of the law from our self-styled umpire . It was a careful weighing of political considerations . He decided then that he would n't join Scalia , Alito , Thomas and Kennedy in going out of his way to wipe the entire law from the books . That would be too abrupt . So he upheld the individual mandate , but only on the grounds of taxation and not the Commerce Clause , as a way to needle the administration . And he also gutted Medicaid as a sop to conservatives .\nHe may regret letting the Affordable Care Act live , and now he gets a second lick at the apple . That gutting Obamacare over this would `` damage the court 's honor '' is not very persuasive . It implies that there 's extant honor for it to lose . That train left the station when the court picked up this stupid case to begin with , if not much earlier .\nA top concern for Roberts , then , might be the extent to which a ruling against the government in King v. Burwell would send the country 's healthcare system into chaos . This should n't be a concern for a justice who 's deciding on the merits of a case , but it is . And it 's a political consideration : his court would more easily get away with an inept ruling if he knew there was a safety net . Convincing Roberts that there is no safety net , then , is a priority for the White House , and convincing him that there is -- that everything will be hunky-dory if he just goes ahead and ruins Obamacare -- is a top goal for the Republicans .\nHHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell appeared before the Senate Finance Committee in what turned out to be a testy hearing yesterday . Republican senators repeatedly pressed her for details on what the administration 's backup plan is should the court eliminate subsidies for insurance plans bought on federally facilitated exchanges . Burwell repeatedly dodged , saying that her focus now is meeting targets for the open enrollment period . Sen. John Cornyn went so far as to suggest she was acting in contempt of Congress .\nDoes the administration have a contingency plan ? Have they thought about what they 'd do ? Well , yeah ! And two former Bush HHS officials who spoke with the Hill seem to nail why Burwell and the administration are keeping their plans close to the chest now : because they do n't want to signal `` weakness '' to John Roberts .\n\u201c Of course , they have one , they should all resign if they don \u2019 t , \u201d said Tom Scully , an HHS official under former President George W. Bush . \u201c And they certainly should not discuss it either. \u201d Former HHS Secretary Michael Leavitt , who left office in 2009 , agreed . He added that he isn \u2019 t surprised that senior officials would rather face a day of bad headlines than signal weakness to the Supreme Court . \u201c If the court thought they had a plan , they might think , they felt like their case was weak , \u201d Leavitt , who also served as governor of Utah , said in an interview .\nThe GOP , of course , would love for the administration to signal weakness -- all while they , the party that controls both chambers of Congress now , signal strength , comfort and reassurance . That 's why they 're putting effort into developing an `` alternative '' to Obamacare after all these years . It 's all to show John Roberts : go ahead , guy , we 'll take care of everything else . There 's no way that any of this should have any bearing on what John Roberts will decide , but it 's a reasonable bet that it will , and it makes perfect , cynical sense to appeal to John Roberts this way .",
