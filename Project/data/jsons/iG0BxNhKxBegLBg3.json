He is pretty much done for and stifled and it \u2019 s really because of personal relationships , or lack of personal relationships , and it is a problem . I approach things a little different , I am still just as hardcore in saying what we are doing , I just chose not to call people liars on the Senate floor and it \u2019 s just a matter of different perspectives on how best to get to the end result .\nIn July , Cruz called Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , the effective leader of the Republican Party , a liar on the Senate floor . Days later , his Republican colleagues refused to grant him the 16 votes needed to pass a simple procedural vote as a public rebuke of his outburst . This week , McConnell got his revenge , denying ( for now ) Cruz the government shutdown over Planned Parenthood he so desperately wanted to prop up his presidential campaign . Of course , that did n't stop the stunts from Cruz -- he tried to offer up a `` referendum '' on McConnell 's leadership this week before being summarily shutdown by his fellow Republican senators .\nOf course , Paul is mostly just backing up the senior senator from his home state of Kentucky , as he actually opposes the continuing resolution set to pass this week to keep the government operating for the time being . Paul , like Cruz , is in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood , even if that means shutting down the government over it . He just disagrees with Cruz 's tact :\nI would defund not only Planned Parenthood but hundreds and hundreds of regulations , hundreds and hundreds of wasteful programs . I would take them all out , put them on the table and say \u2018 You know what Democrats , it doesn \u2019 t take 60 votes to defund something , it \u2019 s actually going to take 60 votes to fund any of these programs , \u2019 vote on them one at a time and we will see how many of these crazy programs get 60 votes . My guess would be very few , but that would take the courage to let the spending expire and start anew and let new programs all require 60 votes to pass\nPaul and Cruz would appear to be natural allies , with their Tea Party base of support and their libertarian bents , but since entering the Senate , the two have had markedly different styles .
