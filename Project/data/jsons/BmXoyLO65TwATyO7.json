Since the 1970s , Americans have enjoyed a good presidential scandal every 20 years or so . Beware , aspirants of 2036 ! The southern wind doth play the trumpet to his purposes , and by his hollow whistling in the leaves foretells a tempest and a blust \u2019 ring day .\nWhenever the next one comes , Americans must demand sweeping changes to the way in which it is handled . More specifically , they must demand that Congress , and not the executive branch itself , be put in charge of the investigations . There is no unaccountable fourth branch of government in the United States . Our repeated attempts to create one \u2014 including over the last couple of years \u2014 have been disastrous .\nThe best thing that one can say about the structure of the now-closed Mueller investigation is that it was marginally preferable to the independent-counsel system that obtained during Bill Clinton \u2019 s investigation and impeachment .
