Republicans \u2014 and some Democrats \u2014 said Mr. Mueller \u2019 s lackluster appearance had all but ended the impeachment threat , and they were not convinced the committee \u2019 s actions on Friday had changed that .\n\u201c Democrats want to convince their base they \u2019 re still wedded to impeachment even after this week \u2019 s hearing , but a baseless legal claim is an odd way to show that , \u201d said Representative Doug Collins of Georgia , the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee . He predicted that the legal maneuver would fail .\nBut Democrats who control the panel called Mr. Mueller \u2019 s testimony an \u201c inflection point \u201d and are now seeking to add more evidence about what they believe to be serious wrongdoing by Mr. Trump .\nMr. Nadler said the committee would continue the investigation during the House \u2019 s six-week summer recess , calling additional witnesses and filing a lawsuit as soon as next week to force Donald F. McGahn II , the former White House counsel , to testify unless he agrees to come voluntarily . Mr. McGahn \u2019 s account of presidential behavior sits at the center of Mr. Mueller \u2019 s report .\nThe 448-page document showed that the Trump campaign welcomed illegal assistance from the Russians in 2016 and expected to benefit from it , but investigators did not establish that Mr. Trump had conspired with them in the illegal hacking and dumping of Democratic emails .\nIt also explored several episodes in which Mr. Trump tried to impede the investigation . But the special counsel decided not to render judgment about whether Mr. Trump should be charged with obstruction of justice , citing a Justice Department view that sitting presidents are temporarily immune from indictment while they are in office .\nAside from the coming court case , it is unclear whether the Judiciary Committee \u2019 s assertion that an impeachment investigation is effectively already underway will resolve a fight that has divided the Democratic Party .
