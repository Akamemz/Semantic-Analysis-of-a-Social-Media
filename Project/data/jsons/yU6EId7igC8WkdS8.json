The legislature is now debating whether to dismantle the Nevada public employee pension system ( PERS ) , a system that has gotten consistently high marks for transparency , responsibility and stewardship .\nThis attack on retirement benefits follows a very familiar pattern of fabricating data to destroy retirements that work and that people really like . It \u2019 s the same nonsense and lies used to destroy private pensions two decades ago , but this time it \u2019 s being done as part of a partisan wet dream of \u201c limited government. \u201d It \u2019 s a strategy as American as fast food and crumbling infrastructure .\nThis latest skirmish in the retirement wars perpetuates the biggest lie ever foisted on America\u2014that we can not afford retirement benefits .\nPrivate pensions have indeed been systematically destroyed in recent decades , and replaced by \u201c defined contribution \u201d 401k plans . The conventional wisdom is that pensions are \u201c too expensive , \u201d but this is the heart of the lie . A great many private pensions were once over-funded , but a change in law allowed companies to \u201c invest \u201d the \u201c excess \u201d funding in other parts of their business . Once businessmen could legally raid the pension fund , the idea of private pensions was over . Many books have been written about the great pension theft . I recommend , for one , reading `` Retirement Heist : How Companies Plunder and Profit from the Nest Eggs of American Workers . '' Spoiler alert : you will feel rage .\nI \u2019 m no bystander in all this , because I \u2019 m a member of the Nevada pension system through my day job . Even when I considered myself a Republican , I supported the pension system , just as my conservative friends and colleagues still do . But a lot has changed in a few years . Public pensions used to have bipartisan support , but the dysfunction and extremism that has turned Washington D.C .into a shit-show has spread to states like mine .\nThe attacks on benefits are always underhanded and dishonest , an effort to keep critics quiet , and this latest attempt is no exception , because it only targets future members of the pension system . It \u2019 s the same tactic used in the constant assault on Social Security -- just take it from people who don \u2019 t have it yet . My favorite visual is the conservative who collects Social Security month after month ( after month after month ) then votes for politicians who will destroy those very modest benefits for his children -- all while reciting the false narrative of \u201c not saddling '' those same children with debt .\nA better idea ( rather than stealing from our own children ) would be to pay the reasonable levels of taxes necessary to fund the programs we all use . But \u201c family values \u201d conservatives are always delighted to burn the crops and salt the earth behind them , children be damned .\nIt \u2019 s understandable that people without pensions resent those who still have them . It \u2019 s much easier to rage about a schoolteacher \u2019 s pension than it is to understand the systemic greed of high finance , and that \u2019 s by design . The rich and powerful who looted private pensions have managed to set the members of the middle class upon one another . At the same time , the purveyors of 401k plans get rich off of fees from individual accounts . Millions of people are shuffled into the market to be preyed upon by the vultures of high finance , who get paid no matter how much money you win or lose in the grand casino .\nI admit that there are reasonable criticisms of pensions . There are always a few people , an overpaid manager or administrator perhaps , who manage to game the system through overtime pay or inflated salaries . Critics can point to the handful of people with six-figure pensions with understandable fury , but to extrapolate it to everyone is plain hogwash . In my own pension system , the average monthly benefit for regular retirees is around 2,200 a month , and retirees are not eligible for Social Security .\nFor those who think pensions should all be abolished , I \u2019 d draw your attention to the constant attacks on Social Security . \u201c Serious \u201d rightwing presidential candidates , and even some Democrats , have proposed upping the retirement age , cutting benefits and in general making life a little less pleasant for retirees . The hope is that many of us will die before we can collect what we \u2019 ve earned through decades of work . Even though the \u201c trust fund \u201d has a balance of trillions of dollars , the money has been used to fund everyday government spending . Politicians would rather loot your retirement rather than fund government spending with honest taxation .\nI \u2019 m not even saying that we have to sacrifice other spending priorities to fund retirements , because there \u2019 s enough wealth in this country to do both .\nBut the very question of affordability is moot , because the attack on retirement has nothing at all to do with money .
