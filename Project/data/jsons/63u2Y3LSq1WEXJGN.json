We do n't even think of Jimmy Savile , the notorious British pedophile , whose show was called `` Jim 'll fix it , '' although some people sure will . No , we think about Election 2000 and the Florida recount , where Jeb proved that his slogan is n't all hot air . Whatever else he did as Governor of Florida , when it came to that election , Jeb fixed it .\nAnyone old enough to remember that election night , which was 15 years ago today , will remember that the outcome of the electoral college depended on that one state . And what came next is exactly what anyone would have predicted would happen when an election is so close it triggers a recount in a state in which the levers of power and the electoral machinery are run by one of the candidates ' brothers . That candidate was the one who became president .\nThe road George W. and Jeb Bush took to get there was complicated and difficult , and in the end had to be decided by a couple of Supreme Court justices who happened to have been appointed by the Bush brothers ' dad when he was president . ( Who says that dynasties have no clout in American politics ? ) But Jeb proved himself to be particularly adept at getting the job done without getting his hands dirty .\nThe media played an interesting part as well . The networks first called the election for Gore based on exit polls which later turned out to correctly predict for whom the people actually voted that day . Fox News , with one of it 's earliest political coups , was the first to call it for Bush . A consultant by the name of John Ellis , who later admitted to being on the phone with Jeb and George W. Bush throughout the evening , is the fellow who made that initial call for Fox . If his name sounds familiar it 's because John Ellis , is also Jeb Bush 's name ; `` Jeb '' stands for John Ellis Bush . Ellis is George W. and Jeb 's first cousin .\nThe Bush campaign knew that once they had established their `` lead '' they needed to keep it . The key was to be able to declare victory and then portray the Gore campaign as being sore losers who refused to accept defeat . On election night , they almost succeeded in getting Gore to capitulate without a fight . He was on the way to make his concession speech when his team told him to hold up , that the margin was ridiculously tight and that a recount would be mandated by state law . The phone call that happened next was a very telling exchange :\n\u201c Circumstances have changed dramatically since I first called you , \u201d Gore told Bush . \u201c The state of Florida is too close to call. \u201d \u201c Are you saying what I think you \u2019 re saying ? \u201d Bush asked . \u201c Let me make sure I understand . You \u2019 re calling back to retract your concession ? \u201d \u201c You don \u2019 t have to be snippy about it , \u201d said Gore . Bush responded that the networks had already called the result and that the numbers were correct\u2014his brother Jeb had told him . \u201c Your little brother , \u201d Gore replied , \u201c is not the ultimate authority on this . \u201d\nThe networks had called the election based on his cousin 's decision and his cousin 's decision had been based on his brother 's numbers . How tidy that was . Gore refused to accept the Bush family 's assurances and went on to contest the outcome .\nJeb may not have been the ultimate authority but he had plenty of influence on the state 's electoral machinery , particularly the Secretary of State Katherine Harris who was in charge of the recount and who also happened to be one of George W. Bush 's campaign co-chairs . According to Jeffrey Toobin 's book `` Too Close to Call '' an angry Jeb awakened Harris at three in the morning to chastise her for allowing the assistant director of elections to go on TV and discuss Florida election laws , which required recounts and a standard of determining the intent of the voter . Jeb had this foolish bureaucrat yanked from the air immediately and he assigned her a political advisor by the name of Mac Stipanovich , a close political associate and master of Florida politics and electoral machinery .\nStipanovich gave interviews years later in which he admitted that he kept a very low profile throughout :\n`` I would arrive in the morning through the garage and come up on the elevators and come in through the cabinet-office door , which is downstairs , and then in the evening when I left , you know , sometimes it \u2019 d be late , depending on what was going on , I would go the same way .
