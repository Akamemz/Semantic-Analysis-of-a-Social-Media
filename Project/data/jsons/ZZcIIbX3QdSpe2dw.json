    "content": "On Thursday , a shooter killed five people in the Capital Gazette newsroom in Annapolis , Maryland , in just the latest example of a mass shooting in America . But unlike so many of the other shootings that have gained national attention , the gunman in this case did not use an AR-15 or what \u2019 s typically considered an assault weapon . Instead , he used a shotgun .\nBut here \u2019 s the thing : When it comes to shootings in America , the use of an assault rifle is actually rare . Shootings with rifles , including assault rifles , make up less than 3 percent of gun homicides in the US . And according to federal data , handguns have over the past couple decades made up the great majority \u2014 more than 70 percent \u2014 of firearms used in homicides .\nThe data , along with the tragedy in Annapolis , shows the limitations of an assault weapons ban , which has become one of the top policy proposals from March for Our Lives and other gun control advocates \u2014 despite also being one of the gun control measures with the least supportive evidence behind it .\nThe typical argument for the ban : Weapons of war have no place in American communities . These high-velocity , high-capacity weapons are particularly deadly , even more so than other semiautomatic firearms such as handguns . They have also been used disproportionately in mass shootings . And they aren \u2019 t needed for hunting or self-defense . So they should be banned altogether .\nAll these claims have a certain intuitive sense behind them . What they don \u2019 t have , however , is a whole lot of empirical evidence , based on my discussions with gun policy experts and researchers . Studies on assault weapons bans have generally ranged from inconclusive to unfavorable toward a ban . And even if the bans were effective at constricting access to assault weapons , they \u2019 d likely have only a small effect on gun violence overall , especially if shooters resort to other types of firearms .\nThat doesn \u2019 t mean an assault weapons ban would have absolutely no effect . Consider the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas . In that case , the gunman parked himself on the 32nd floor of a hotel near a country music concert and fired indiscriminately into the crowd with assault weapons \u2014 which were also retooled with bump stocks to mimic the firepower of machine guns . He killed 58 people and injured hundreds .\nBump stock or not , it stands to reason that the shooting would have been much less lethal if the shooter didn \u2019 t use an assault weapon and used , say , a more conventional handgun instead . The bullets would have had shorter range , and those that hit would have had lower velocity and therefore caused less damage . In a shooting with such a high casualty count , that could \u2019 ve translated to potentially hundreds of injuries averted \u2014 although the shooter also could have changed his approach without access to assault weapons .\nStill , it \u2019 s worth putting this in context : This kind of violence is already relatively infrequent . Rifles are very rarely used in homicides , and mass shooting deaths make up less than 4 percent of gun homicides in the US . And as the Capital Gazette shooting shows , not all of these horrific events involve assault rifles . So , again , pushing assault weapons out of circulation wouldn \u2019 t have a big impact on overall gun violence in America , even if it has some impact on some particularly awful tragedies .\nThese are just some of the complications that limit an assault weapons ban \u2019 s effectiveness . So while the policy may seem intuitive , there isn \u2019 t much evidence to support it \u2014 and in a world with limited political capital for gun reforms , those gaps in the research need to be taken seriously .\nThe most cited review of the evidence is a 2013 analysis by researcher Christopher Koper on the effect of the 1994 federal assault weapons ban , which lawmakers let expire in 2004 .\nThe analysis concluded , \u201c The ban did not appear to affect gun crime during the time it was in effect , but some evidence suggests it may have modestly reduced gunshot victimizations had it remained in place for a longer period . \u201d\nThat was partially , Koper wrote , because the 1994 ban was riddled with loopholes .\nTo understand why , consider a surprisingly tricky question in this discussion : What is an assault weapon , and how do you define it ? For lawmakers , these questions have posed a challenge over the years .\nPeople might have a vision of an assault weapon in their heads \u2014 say , a semiautomatic rifle like an AR-15 \u2014 but defining what makes that an assault weapon can be difficult . Is it that it \u2019 s semiautomatic ? Well , there are semiautomatic handguns and hunting rifles too . Is it the high velocity and long range ? Traditional hunting rifles can also have those features . Is it the pistol grip ? That offers an easy way around the law then \u2014 if someone could just remove a pistol grip , then it \u2019 s no longer an illegal assault weapon .\nUltimately , the 1994 ban settled on a definition of assault weapons that included , among other features , \u201c pistol grips on rifles , flash hiders , folding rifle stocks , threaded barrels for attaching silencers , and the ability to accept ammunition magazines holding large numbers of bullets , \u201d as well as some specific guns by name and \u201c copies or duplicates \u201d of them , Koper wrote . That captured some handguns , on top of the rifles that people might typically think of as assault weapons .\nBut the ban was still easily bypassed , Koper noted : \u201c Relatively cosmetic changes , such as removing a flash hider or bayonet mount , were thus sufficient to transform a banned weapon into a legal substitute . In this sense , the law is perhaps best understood not as a gun ban but as a law that restricted weapon accessories. \u201d Gun manufacturers took advantage of this , producing modified versions of previous weapons to make them legal \u2014 blowing a big hole in the law .\nPlus , guns made and owned prior to the ban were grandfathered in , making them legal to own and transfer . That comprised at least 1.5 million assault weapons in the US at the start of the ban , according to Koper .\nThis gets into another tricky aspect of banning assault weapons : Do past guns get to stay around , or are there efforts to take those out of circulation through , for instance , a buyback program or a mandatory registration-and-tax scheme ( similar to current laws for automatic weapons ) ? The 1994 ban took the former approach , but March for Our Lives has called for the latter with a new ban .\nThe 1994 ban was also attached to a ban on high-capacity magazines that carried more than 10 rounds , which Koper suggested was arguably the law \u2019 s \u201c most important provision. \u201d That \u2019 s in part because this ban also affected the firearms that weren \u2019 t covered by the assault weapons ban , so it could affect a much broader level of gun violence . Indeed , a study from February by Koper suggested that high-capacity magazines may be involved more often in typical shooting deaths than previously thought .\nBut at the end of the day , Koper found that the 1994 ban had no significant effect on gun crime \u2014 although it may have had some modest effects if it had been allowed to stay around for longer and over time pushed more assault weapons and high-capacity magazines out of circulation .\nKoper \u2019 s analysis had two big gaps : It didn \u2019 t look at the 1994 ban \u2019 s effect on mass shootings , and it didn \u2019 t analyze state laws .\nFor that , the best review of the evidence is an extensive report by the RAND Corporation released in March , which looked at US studies on gun control , including assault weapons bans at the state level .\nHere , too , the news is not good for an assault weapons ban . RAND found that the available studies were often contradictory . Focusing specifically on the most rigorous studies , RAND found the evidence for bans \u2019 effects on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines on mass shootings and violent crime in general to be \u201c inconclusive . \u201d\n\u201c None of [ the studies ] provided what we considered to be any kind of conclusive evidence , \u201d Andrew Morral , the head of RAND \u2019 s gun policy initiative , told me .\n\u201c The studies are pretty weak , \u201d Morral said . \u201c Also , a lot of these bans have been pretty weak \u201d \u2014 noting many of the same loopholes that the Koper analysis did .\nBut what if an assault weapons ban wasn \u2019 t weak \u2014 and really took these guns out of circulation ? The US could , for example , follow Australia \u2019 s lead and ban a much broader category of semiautomatic rifles and institute a mandatory buyback program \u2014 basically , a firearm confiscation scheme . Would that have a significant effect ?\nA ban would have little effect on overall gun violence but maybe some on mass shootings\nExperts said that even a more effective ban on assault weapons likely wouldn \u2019 t have much of an impact on overall gun violence in the US .\nThat \u2019 s because only a small percentage of overall gun violence involves assault weapons , with the great majority of firearm homicides involving more conventional handguns . And Morral said there \u2019 s no reason to believe an assault weapons ban would have any effect on suicides , which have in recent years made up around 60 percent of all gun deaths .\nIn a country with so many gun deaths , cutting even a percentage point or two of overall gun deaths could still save hundreds of lives a year . But in terms of addressing America \u2019 s overall gun problem , it just wouldn \u2019 t have a big impact .\nStill , experts said that an assault weapons ban may have a significant effect on the lethality of mass shootings .\nAssault weapons \u2019 \u201c functionality is really most relevant in the context of a public mass shooting , \u201d Daniel Webster , the director at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research , told me .\nThe research still isn \u2019 t good in this area , in large part because there is no single accepted database for tracking mass shootings and what weapons they involve . But there are some analyses that can be drawn on .\nPrevious research by criminologist James Alan Fox suggests that the 1994 ban did not have an appreciable effect on the number of mass shootings .\nBut Webster argued that although the ban \u2019 s end in 2004 may not have resulted in more mass shootings , it might have resulted in more mass shooting deaths . He also pointed out that since the 1994 ban left so many guns in circulation and therefore could only phase out assault weapons over time , it should be expected that the ban could only have a gradual effect .\nWebster cited an unpublished analysis of Mother Jones \u2019 s public mass shootings database : \u201c When you fit a statistical model that fits a gradual impact [ and looks at a counterfactual in which a ban isn \u2019 t in place ] \u2026 the number of people who are shot in public mass shootings goes down roughly by 10 percent every year that the law was in place. \u201d He cautioned that this is preliminary data , but it suggests that the federal assault weapons ban really did cut the lethality of mass shootings .\nMorral , meanwhile , pointed to a 2017 analysis from the gun control advocacy group Everytown , which suggested that assault weapons weren \u2019 t used in a majority of mass shootings but did make these events deadlier .\nRAND summarized the findings : \u201c Another analysis that focused on mass shooting events involving four or more fatalities between 2009 and 2016 reported that 15 of these incidents ( 11 percent ) involved an assault weapon or high-capacity magazine , resulting in 155 percent more injuries and 47 percent more fatalities compared with other incidents . \u201d\n\u201c That \u2019 s probably the case : You would get fewer deaths in mass shootings , \u201d Morral said , clarifying that this is based on inference , not the results of specific studies . \u201c That \u2019 s not nothing , but it \u2019 s a small proportion of total firearm homicides . \u201d\nThis , then , is where one should expect the effect of a stringent assault weapons ban to fall . And certainly , that would matter to groups like March for Our Lives \u2014 which formed after a school shooting in which the gunman used an assault weapon .\nBut if March for Our Lives wants to address broader gun violence \u2014 as it suggested it did during its big Washington , DC , event \u2014 then the research suggests that it \u2019 s going to have to think about other policies too .\nOther gun policies could do more \u2014 and have popular support\nMarch for Our Lives has put forward other proposals . Its official five-point plan calls for more gun violence research , strengthening the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms , and Explosives , and universal background checks , on top of its demand for an assault weapons ban and a ban on high-capacity magazines .\nBased on the empirical research into assault weapons bans , it might be more prudent to focus on the other policies , which target all types of guns . In a world with limited political capital , the assault weapons ban \u2019 s limitations are an important part of the discussion . And while bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines ( which , again , typically go hand in hand ) do have 65-plus percent support in Pew surveys , they face far more opposition from Republicans than other measures \u2014 and therefore would struggle to get through a Senate process that would likely require bipartisan support .\n\u201c If my child was injured or killed in a mass shooting with an assault rifle , I would be outraged , and I would say that it \u2019 s unacceptable , and I would want to ban them \u2014 and that \u2019 s completely legitimate and appropriate , \u201d Webster said . But , he added , other measures would go further in reducing overall gun violence .\nTo this end , universal background checks \u2014 which are included in the March for Our Lives plan \u2014 could help . The RAND report , for one , found evidence that background checks are linked to a reduction in firearm homicides and suicides .\nThere are other measures not included in the March for Our Lives plan that experts argue could do more to mitigate gun violence . Webster said that gun licensing and permitting schemes \u2014 which are a bit like the process of getting a driver \u2019 s license , except much more rigorous \u2014 are at the top of his list of plausible policy preferences .\nHe pointed to two of his studies from Missouri and Connecticut that indicated those states \u2019 permit-to-purchase laws reduced gun deaths . These studies are often cited in support of background checks ( since getting a permit requires a background check ) . But Webster said the true strength of these types of laws is the permitting process : \u201c The states that don \u2019 t have that [ permit-to-purchase requirement ] , we \u2019 re not seeing the robust effects that we see with the permitting . \u201d\nA 2013 survey that Webster worked on found that more than 77 percent of Americans would back a gun licensing policy .\nAfter the permit-to-purchase requirement , Webster said states could also do more to raise standards for who can legally own a gun : increase minimum age requirements , extend how long people are barred from buying a firearm after certain offenses and restraining orders , add more offenses to the list of disqualifiers , and so on . And he said lawmakers could enact stricter concealed carry policies .\nThere are far more things the US could do beyond these measures . The key problem , based on the research , is that America has too many guns , and those guns allow more gun deaths . Anything that successfully restricts firearms and reduces the number of guns in circulation , then , could help reduce gun deaths . To this end , a 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries , published in Epidemiologic Reviews , found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence \u2014 a strong indicator that restricting access to firearms can save lives .\nBut there are political , cultural , and legal considerations in the US that make it very unlikely that lawmakers will do , say , an Australia-style mandatory buyback program anytime soon \u2014 even though there is evidence that it saved lives .\nThose same political , cultural , and legal considerations also make it important to prioritize the best policies . Given that Congress couldn \u2019 t pass even a limited bill mostly focused on background checks after a gunman in 2012 killed 20 children and six others at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown , Connecticut , adding additional asks on top of background checks should require good empirical evidence . And so far , bans on assault weapons , especially the limited versions the US has historically done , don \u2019 t have that kind of support .",

To this end, a 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries, published in Epidemiologic Reviews, found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence \u2014 a strong indicator that restricting access to firearms can save lives.\n\nBut there are political, cultural, and legal considerations in the US that make it very unlikely that lawmakers will do, say, an Australia-style mandatory buyback program anytime soon \u2014 even though there is evidence that it saved lives.\n\nThose same political, cultural, and legal considerations also make it important to prioritize the best policies. Given that Congress couldn\u2019t pass even a limited bill mostly focused on background checks after a gunman in 2012 killed 20 children and six others at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, adding additional asks on top of background checks should require good empirical evidence. And so far, bans on assault weapons, especially the limited versions the US has historically done, don\u2019t have that kind of support.",
