As recent analyses from the Rhodium Group and the Clean Air Task Force have argued , the US also needs to reduce methane emissions dramatically to get there :\nCarbon-dioxide is the biggest greenhouse gas responsible for global warming . But it 's not the only one . There 's also methane . The US burns a lot of methane \u2014 known as `` natural gas '' \u2014 for energy .

On one level , that 's good news for climate change : utilities are now burning more natural gas for electricity instead of coal , which means lower carbon-dioxide emissions from power plants .\nThe problem is that all this new drilling increases the risk of methane leaking into the air \u2014 and those leaks are undermining the climate benefits of the gas boom .\nIn theory , it should be doable to plug these methane emissions , which can come from leaky pipelines or faulty drilling operations .

Some rules would focus on methane leaks from new oil and gas wells . Others would focus on pipelines used to transport the natural gas . The Interior Department is updating standards for drilling on public lands .\nThe White House noted that the oil and gas industry has already managed to cut methane emissions 16 percent since 1990 through voluntary measures . `` Nevertheless , '' it added , `` emissions from the oil and gas sector are projected to rise more than 25 percent by 2025 without additional steps to lower them .
