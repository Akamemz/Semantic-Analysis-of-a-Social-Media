Those powers can deprive defendants of their liberty , their property , even their lives . Merely investigating someone can be crushing . That should only be done when demanded by justice \u2014 not the whim of a president . It is a Solomonic solution by Mr .

He need not do it again . Let Mr. Trump fire him if he dares .\nFirst , the Russia investigation continues to hang over the president . Firing Mr .
