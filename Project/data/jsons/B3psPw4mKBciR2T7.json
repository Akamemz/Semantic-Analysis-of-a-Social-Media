The event proceeded relatively peacefully , with minimal disruption .\nBut there were many who believed Stanford should never have allowed Spencer to speak in the first place , including a group of Stanford faculty and students who published an open letter urging the university to block Spencer 's talk .\nThe argument of the letter 's authors is that while they `` fully support the principle of academic freedom that allows us to disagree about issues , '' Spencer 's views on Islam are `` not debatable '' because they are `` fundamentally dehumanizing . ''\nWhenever the claim is made that an identity group is inherently less worthy of full personhood \u2014 whether that claim is made about people who are Muslim , Rohingya , Jewish , Black , trans or gender non-conforming , Bosnian , queer , immigrants , Mexican , etc . \u2014 it is always unacceptable .\nThis has quickly become one of the most common , insidious , and dangerously slippery-slope arguments against free speech on college campuses and beyond . Let 's set aside for a moment that even most truly `` dehumanizing '' speech is protected by the First Amendment . ( Although Stanford is not a public university , California 's Leonard Law applies the protections of the First Amendment to non-sectarian private schools . ) The reality on campus is that any debate over any controversial issue will , for proponents of this viewpoint , unjustly demean the value of someone 's identity .\nConsider students at the University of Florida who earlier this week vandalized promotional materials for an upcoming pro-life event on campus put on by the university 's Young Americans for Freedom . In a Facebook message bragging about the vandalism , one student wrote : `` just poured water on your lovely creations that are an insult to my entire major and life experiences ! ''\nTo others , an opposing view on immigration policy is an attack on the humanity of undocumented immigrants . As NYU professor and provost Ulrich Baer wrote last spring in The New York Times , `` [ s ] ome topics , such as claims that some human beings are by definition inferior to others , or illegal or unworthy of legal standing , are not open to debate because such people can not debate them on the same terms . ''\nMeanwhile , after Laura Kipnis \u2014 the feminist Northwestern professor who was twice investigated by Northwestern for Title IX violations over her criticism of campus sexual politics \u2014 spoke at Wellesley College , the faculty on the school 's Commission for Ethnicity , Race , and Equity issued a statement calling for changes to the outside speaker policy . Speakers like Kipnis , the statement said , require students to `` invest time and energy in rebutting the speakers ' arguments\u2026 in order to affirm their humanity . ''\nWhen Heather Mac Donald , a vocal critic of the Black Lives Matter movement , spoke last spring at Claremont McKenna College , violent protesters attempted to shut down the event , forcing the Manhattan Institute fellow to give her talk via livestream . Three students from nearby Pomona College issued a statement saying `` [ t ] he idea that the search for this truth involves entertaining Heather Mac Donald 's hate speech is illogical . If engaged , Heather Mac Donald would not be debating on mere difference of opinion , but the right of Black people to exist . ''\nAnd who can forget the reaction of Yale students to Erika Christakis 's thoughtfully worded email , in October of 2015 , questioning whether an institution of higher education should police the Halloween costumes of adult college students ?\nStudents blasted Christakis and her husband , Nicholas , for failing to create a `` safe space '' for them , despite their reputations as nurturing residence mentors . In one article describing how her world was `` shaken '' by Christakis 's `` offensive '' email , a Yale student wrote , `` This kind of racism in disguise \u2014 where a false debate about 'free speech ' is used to question people of color 's humanity \u2014 needs to stop . ''\nTwo months after her email , Erika Christakis resigned from her teaching role at Yale , later explaining that she had `` lost confidence '' in her ability to teach in an environment where `` full discussion of certain topics\u2026 has almost become taboo . '' In May 2016 , both Nicholas and Erika announced that they resigned from their Silliman College duties to pursue academic work full time .\nThe `` humanity denying '' argument for censorship is not self-limiting , as these examples illustrate . If accepted , the argument can and will be used to shut down debate on a variety of issues profoundly important to us \u2014 including that `` scholarly debate over affordable health care '' the Stanford professors claim they would welcome .\nAny serious health policy debate involves questions of priorities .
