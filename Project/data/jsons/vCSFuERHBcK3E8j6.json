Here\u2019s what you need to know about grand juries\n\nWhat is a grand jury and how serious is it for Donald Trump?\n\nIt has emerged that US special counsel Robert Mueller is using a grand jury in Washington as part of an investigation into potential coordination or collusion between Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Russia. But what is a grand jury, how does it work and what does Trump have to fear?\n\nWhat is a grand jury?\n\nGrand juries are used in only a handful of countries. In the US, they are normally made up of about 16 to 23 members of the public rather than the usual 12, hence \u201cgrand\u201d jury. They are held in secret \u2013 the fact that one has been convened is not even officially acknowledged. The Wall Street Journal leaked that one has been set up in Washington by Mueller. It will look into links between the Trump team and Russia to influence the White House election and whether there has been any subsequent attempt to obstruct justice.\n\nHow serious is this development for Trump?\n\nPotentially huge. The grand jury decides whether a case is strong enough to push ahead with an indictment. But one of the main reasons for holding a grand jury is that it is a powerful investigative tool. It can subpoena witnesses and demand the production of documents.\n\nCould Trump be called to give evidence?\n\nYes. Richard Nixon was called before a grand jury in 1975 over the Watergate case after he resigned as president. Bill Clinton was president when he testified before a grand jury into the Whitewater real estate controversy.\n\nDonald Trump Jr and the president\u2019s son-in-law and White House adviser, Jared Kushner, could also be called to testify over their controversial June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer.\n\nWhy are grand juries feared?\n\nFederal prosecutors often treat them as fishing expeditions. Witnesses can be questioned under oath for hours on end, with investigators hoping to trip them up and make them perjure themselves.\n\nUnlike in ordinary courts, witnesses are not allowed to have lawyers present.
