It was like 'gotcha , gotcha . ' Every question was , do I know this one and that one . You know , he worked hard on that . I thought he said Kurds , '' Trump said . `` By the way , I do think the Kurds , while we 're on it , I do think the Kurds are not being utilized properly and not being treated properly by us . ''\nHewitt , in a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588 , said he thought many of Trump 's answers were `` excellent , '' but that `` we disagree on what constitutes a 'gotcha ' question .

But I wo n't change my debate prep or question set because of his or others critiques or praise . I ask questions that I think many GOP primary voters are interested in , whether of DT or all the other GOPers . Others interviewed this week include Christie , Graham , Huckabee , Rubio and Walker as well as Fiorina twice . They all get tough questions with some overlap and some new ones each time .
