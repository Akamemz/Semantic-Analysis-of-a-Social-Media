Canadians , make some noise ! \u201d It \u2019 s a new era for Canadians \u2014 the full legalization of marijuana across the country . It \u2019 s been legal to consume cannabis here for medical reasons since 2001 . But now , anyone in Canada over the legal age can get high . And that means Canada \u2019 s booming weed business is about to get a whole lot bigger . We went to see some of the producers who are set to take advantage of this opportunity . \u201c It \u2019 s got kind of a citrusy and pine smell both at the same time . This is one of the Kushes . It \u2019 s got more of a turpentine , maybe a little more earthy smell . This is a very popular strain for us . We call this deep purple , very fruity. \u201d Warren Bravo was a co-founder of Green Relief , a medical marijuana company that is now well-placed to enter the recreational space . He \u2019 s aiming to increase production 20-fold over the next year and a half . And that \u2019 s nothing compared to Canada \u2019 s top marijuana producer : Tweed Inc. , a brand of big-time operation , Canopy Growth . One vault here can hold about $ 150 million worth of cannabis . \u201c Yeah , so in this facility , on this side that we \u2019 re touring here , we have 24 flowering rooms and then about another 24 on the other side as well . This is , at the end of the day , what all of the fuss and excitement is about , I guess . When we reached out the first time , I think , you know , the New York Stock Exchange probably , you know , rightly said , \u2018 No way. \u2019 You know , we \u2019 re not having a cannabis company . And then that education process started . And if you try to break down these barriers , and demonstrate we \u2019 re a normal company creating a normal product like anyone else. \u201d And it \u2019 s a product that \u2019 s becoming a formal field of study , fast . \u201c We \u2019 re running the only postgraduate certificate program in cannabis in Canada. \u201d Bill MacDonald teaches a class of 24 highly dedicated students , that includes a former police officer . \u201c It did take some reconciliation because I was , obviously , on the other side .
