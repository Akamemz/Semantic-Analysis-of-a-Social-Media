Ted Poe .\nTexas Rep. Ted Poe said in an exclusive interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 TV that he is now awaiting answer to a second letter to Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta as to whose guns were used in the attack that lead to the murder of four Americans .\nPoe also said that financial aid to Egypt should temporarily be stopped while we wait to see how the dictatorial leanings of President Mohamed Morsi work out in the next several months .\n\u201c Their blissful silence says wonders , \u201d he said . \u201c It looks like the United States gave the okay to our ally Qatar to ship weapons to rebel groups to overthrow Gadhafi - rebel groups in Libya , probably militant Islamic rebel groups , and where those weapons ended up before the Benghazi attack on our ambassador and Navy SEALs we don \u2019 t know . But it looks like the U.S. did get the green light and [ give ] the wink to Qatar to ship weapons to the rebels . \u201d\nSome rebel groups in the Middle East , including some the U.S. works with in Libya , Syria , Qatar , and other countries , are no better than the governments that we \u2019 re trying to help overthrow , Poe said . He added that the risk is that we help to make things worse while thinking we \u2019 ll make them better .\n\u201c Qatar [ is ] our ally , but yet they are an Islamic state . Who they smuggle those weapons to , we hear the word \u2018 rebel \u2019 and they \u2019 re trying to overthrow a dictator . Some of these rebel groups , both in Libya and in Syria , they are worse than the current government , \u201d Poe said . \u201c They \u2019 re more radical than the current government . So we certainly want to know what organizations , what people , specifically , Qatar smuggled the weapons to and then we should go from there . But the United States , apparently , approved of them doing so . That \u2019 s why they must have asked us and got some kind of permission to go ahead and smuggle the weapons . \u201d\nBased on that , the Congressman said it may still be necessary to have a special select committee to look into certain facets of what happened in Benghazi \u2014 especially now that we know the U.S. was at least looking the other way while weapons were funneled to the rebels .\n\u201c You \u2019 d think we \u2019 d learn from history that when we help or are aware of weapons going into different countries , somebody \u2019 s going to pick them up and use them and they may not be in the interest of America when those weapons are used , \u201d Poe said . \u201c It looks like in this situation that the U.S. lost control [ and ] oversight of the weapons that Qatar was smuggling into Libya . Kind of sounds like \u2018 Fast and Furious , \u2019 when the United States lost control and oversight of weapons that our government helped facilitate smuggling into Mexico . You \u2019 d think we \u2019 d quit doing that but here \u2019 s another example it appears . \u201d\nPoe also said that while we continue to deal with fallout from the attack in Benghazi , the dictatorial leanings of Morsi in Egypt must be kept in mind .\nDespite his assistance in helping to broker a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian Authority , it may be appropriate to hold off on financial support for Egypt until we see whether Morsi is about to embrace his inner dictator or really is trying to keep his country on the proper path to democracy .\n\u201c It should be frozen right now until we see how this is going to turn out with the new president , or dictator , \u201d Poe said . \u201c We have the power to do that .
