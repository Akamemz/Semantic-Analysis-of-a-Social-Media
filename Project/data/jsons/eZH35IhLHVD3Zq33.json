After Trump appeared to soften his stance on China tariffs , aides swooped in to explain he was n't backing down .\nPrivately , American officials griped the yearly gathering is being orchestrated to isolate the United States . Aides to other leaders shrugged off the accusation , saying Trump 's go-it-alone views on climate change , Russia and trade were his own doing .\nIn the middle of it all , Iran 's foreign minister turned up unexpectedly for talks with his French counterpart , furthering the impression that Trump -- who withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal that his European counterparts are working to salvage -- is a man apart .\nIt all added up to a fraught beginning to the G7 , which ordinarily proceeds with friendly displays of partnership and without the obvious level of discord playing out at the elegant seaside resort Biarritz .\nAlready , the near-consensus among Trump 's foreign counterparts that tariffs on China are causing the global economy to slump appeared to weigh on the President . He told reporters he 's had his own misgivings .\n`` I have second thoughts about everything , '' he said , without saying what he might be reconsidering .\nHours later , aides insisted the President had trouble hearing the question and that Trump remains staunch as ever in his tariff regime .\n`` He did n't exactly hear the question . Actually what he was intending to say is he always has second thoughts and actually had second thoughts about possibly a higher tariff response to China , '' Trump 's chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Sunday on CNN 's `` State of the Union . ''\nBut that was n't Trump 's only turnabout . He also softened his threat to force US companies out of China -- despite insisting a day earlier he was able to do it using his executive powers .\n`` I have no plan right now . Actually , we 're getting along very well with China right now . We 're talking , '' Trump said .\nKudlow confirmed there 's `` nothing now in the cards '' to exert executive authority that would bar US firms from doing business in China -- but would n't rule out the possibility in the future .\n`` Ultimately we do have such authority but it is not going to be exercised presently , '' he said .\nThe hurried clean-up reflected the precarious position Trump has adopted as he meets with world leaders . Even as they lobby against the tariffs , which they blame for various economic woes , Trump has insisted the tariffs are working and must remain in place .\nThat 's caused considerable angst at the summit , where Trump 's counterparts had gripped themselves for confrontation before his arrival .\nEven an impromptu lunch Saturday between Trump and his host , Emmanuel Macron , appeared to be an attempt by the French President to corner Trump into a discussion of climate change and trade .\nTrump insisted the meal was their best meeting ever . But afterward , American officials complained the session materialized without warning and amounted to a first attempt by Macron to mold his summit around issues that will divide Trump from other leaders .\nThe surprise announcement that Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was in Biarritz meeting with his French counterpart only fueled the notion of a summit on France 's terms . Zarif was not expected to meet any American officials during his visit to France , which was first discovered when an Iranian plane was spotted on the tarmac here .\nUS officials say they were n't given significant advance warning that Zarif would be in Biarritz . One administration official called Zarif 's unexpected arrival at the G7 a `` curveball , '' but claimed it was Macron 's prerogative to invite him .\nMacron alerted Trump and other leaders that Zarif would be in France during the Saturday evening dinner with G7 leaders . But US officials were n't aware of the plans in the lead up to the summit , according to two senior administration officials .\nTrump has chided Macron in the past for sending `` mixed signals '' to Iran ; he said Sunday he had n't discussed any joint message from the G7 to Tehran during the summit after the French presidency suggested Macron would deliver such a statement .\nAsked about Zarif 's presence in Biarritz on Sunday , Trump offered only a curt `` no comment . ''\nLess contentious was a Sunday morning breakfast with Boris Johnson , the newly installed British prime minister in whom Trump sees a more natural ally .\n`` You know who this is ? '' Trump asked reporters , gesturing toward Johnson , as the men descended a grand staircase at Trump 's hotel . `` He 's going to be a fantastic prime minster . ''\nLater , over a meal of scrambled eggs and veal sausage , Trump acknowledged he was more aligned with Johnson than his predecessor in Downing Street , Theresa May .\n`` He needs no advice . He 's the right man for the job . I 've been saying that for a long time . It did n't make your predecessor happy , '' Trump said .\nIn Johnson , Trump has at last found a leader of a major US ally with whom he is politically aligned , in style if not substance .

It has to happen , '' Trump said .\n`` Just to register a faint , sheeplike note of our view on the trade war : we 're in favor of trade peace on the whole , '' he said . `` We think that on the whole , the UK has profited massively in the last 200 years from free trade and that 's what we want to see . So , that 's what we 're keen to see . We do n't like tariffs on the whole .
