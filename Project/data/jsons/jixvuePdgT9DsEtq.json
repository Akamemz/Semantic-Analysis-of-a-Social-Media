    "content": "A newly-obtained memo written during special counsel Kenneth Starr 's investigation of President Bill Clinton rejects a commonly held view that a sitting president ca n't be indicted , The New York Times reported .\nThe discovery adds a possible new wrinkle into the investigation into Russia and President Donald Trump 's campaign .\nThe memo has been locked away in the National Archives since 1998 , but was obtained by the Times ' Charlie Savage through a Freedom of Information Act request , and represents a thorough analysis of the opinion , the newspaper reported Saturday .\nAccording to the findings , the memo concludes that `` no one , even President Clinton , is above the law '' and says it is `` proper , constitutional , and legal for a federal grand jury to indict a sitting president for serious criminal acts that are not part of , and are contrary to , the president 's official duties . ''\nRonald Rotunda , a prominent conservative professor of constitutional law and ethics , was assigned to write the memo when deputy prosecutors told Starr they had enough evidence to send to a grand jury against Clinton . The prosecutors also compiled a draft for an indictment against Clinton .\nThe Times has also put in a request for that , but the National Archives is still determining if the document could fall under secrecy rules for grand juries .\nStarr 's findings were not the first time a special counsel had determined a sitting president could be indicted . Watergate special counsel Leon Jaworski , in 1974 , also got a memo from his staff saying then-President Richard Nixon could be indicted .\nBoth Starr and Jaworski chose to allow the matter proceed to impeachment , rather than indictments , but the memos bring up a possibility that former FBI Director Robert Mueller , in charge of the Russia investigation , could have options allowing him to proceed with a criminal case .\nIn addition , the Constitution and federal law does not ban presidents from being indicted , but others argue that the Constitution 's `` structural principles '' forbid it .\nIn the Starr memo , Rotunda argued that if the `` framers of the Constitution wanted to create a special immunity for the president , they could have written the relevant clause . ''\nIn addition , he said that if indictments had to wait until a president left office , some crimes would not come to trial because of statute of limitations considerations .",
