At the same time , letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump , despite his attempt to subvert the system , should have another chance\u2026 Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus .

And we want to know that the 2020 Democratic candidates understand that and are willing to respond accordingly. \u201d Dean Obeidallah , CNN\n\u201c There \u2019 s plenty of reasonable debate over whether Democratic candidates should focus on Trump in mounting their arguments , or if they should focus on what they want to do for voters\u2026 I suspect this is a bit of a false choice , as what we need is a little bit of both . But if we \u2019 re going to talk about Donald Trump , I think we need to acknowledge that he wasn \u2019 t created in a vacuum . Our systemic racism and sexism , coupled with our economic insecurities , built a world in which Trump could come to power .

Thus , if Biden had entered the presidential race with a standard biographical video describing his many accomplishments in public life\u2026 he would have immediately prompted a debate about all the positions he once took\u2014on crime , financial deregulation , Anita Hill , and the Iraq War\u2014that Democrats now scorn\u2026\n\u201c A lot of the attacks on Biden are , from an electoral angle , silly . Going after Biden for his lack of liberal wokeness , for example , seems destined to fail , given that the polling shows that Democrats want the party to move in a more moderate direction . Biden 's age is more likely to derail his candidacy \u2026 The fact that Biden is called \u2018 Sleepy Joe \u2019 by Trump and is known to make gaffes may open the age question more than polling indicates right now. \u201d Harry Enten , CNN\n\u201c As Democrats assess the dizzying array of 20 candidates , the first question they should ask is whether a nominee could gain a strong majority in the general election and defeat Trump\u2026 [ Biden ] would be far from an ideal president , let alone a Democratic candidate . Maybe in one of those blessed miracles of American democracy that produced our greatest presidents , someone else will emerge who 's younger , smarter , more representative of a diverse electorate .

As Democrats have spent the past several months outlining the sweeping changes they want to make to the United States , more than anything , Biden 's candidacy represents a promise to go back to a pre-Trump era in American politics\u2026\n\u201c Biden has consistently led in polls . It 's of course possible his numbers will collapse as he undergoes more rigorous scrutiny and as his name recognition advantage erodes as voters get to know the other candidates better .

A curious thing happens to Democrats after they leave the presidency . The shine seems to dull from their pennies quite quickly .

This is not merely a result of his sexual peccadillos , but also a function of how fast the Democratic Party changes\u2026\n\u201c By the standards of his time in office , it would be wrong to call Obama a moderate . He did , after all , run to the left of Hillary Clinton in 2008 . But by today \u2019 s standards , it would be wrong not to call him a moderate\u2026 [ The question is ] does Obama still represent hope and change for the Democratic Party ? Or like Bill Clinton , will his moderation be held against him ? For Biden , that question will determine the success of his campaign ; for the Democratic Party , that question will determine their very identity . \u201d\n\u201c Obama was a history-making candidate , allowing voters to be aspirational about their country and themselves by voting for him . And Biden isn \u2019 t . Biden is the white guy who got in trouble for calling Obama \u2018 clean \u2019 and \u2018 articulate. \u2019 ... Biden \u2019 s candidacy is an attempt by Democrats to bargain with Trump \u2019 s America . Other candidates are promising to cleanse America from what Democrats see as the disgrace or even the sacrilege of Trump \u2019 s presidency . Democrats don \u2019 t want to bargain with the devil , they want an exorcist . \u201d\n\u201c There are structural elements facing Biden on the path to the nomination , too , particularly the delegates that can be won in caucuses instead of primaries , where activists have much greater power . It \u2019 s those caucuses that Obama used effectively to defeat Hillary Clinton in 2008 . Biden will likely perform well in the big states , but he will need an effective caucus organization to have a chance of winning the nomination\u2026 With so many credible and not so credible candidates , we may\u2026 be headed for a Democratic convention with no winner on the first ballot . \u201d\n\u201c It is pretty telling that a seventy-six year old , who \u2019 d be 78 if elected , is going to have to swoop in to save the Democrats from themselves and also that he may not be able to do it because he is too moderate for the base . Biden could give Donald Trump a real run for his money . They both understand and connect with blue collar workers who feel left behind .
