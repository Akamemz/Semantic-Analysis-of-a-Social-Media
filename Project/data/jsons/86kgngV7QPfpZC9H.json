In his attempt to convince the nation that a genuine crisis is unfolding at the southern border , the President 's arguments face extreme skepticism from those not already in his camp .\nAbout 57 % of Americans oppose Trump 's wall compared with 38 % in favor , according to a December CNN poll conducted by SSRS . Those numbers are similar to where they were just after Trump took office in 2017 .\nOn Tuesday night , Trump will commandeer the symbolic might of his office in an effort to bolster a political approach that has failed to force Democrats to cave to his demand for $ 5 billion in wall funding amid a government shutdown now in its third week .\nHe will hold forth on a deeply contentious issue from the spot where President Ronald Reagan eulogized the Challenger space shuttle crew and where other predecessors gave notice of the start or ends of wars .\nThe historically resonant stagecraft represents an attempt to convince the country -- with scant hard evidence -- that a real threat is unfolding on the frontier of the US and Mexico border , including drug trafficking , rising sickness among migrants , increasing border crossings and a busted asylum system .\n`` The American people will hear from the President tonight that we have a crisis , '' Vice President Mike Pence told `` CBS This Morning '' Tuesday , part of a series of appearances on network morning shows to make the administration 's case .
