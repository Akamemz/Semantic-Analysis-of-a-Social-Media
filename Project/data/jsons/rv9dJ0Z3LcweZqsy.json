    "content": "President Donald Trump spoke his version of truth-to-power -- or powers , all 193 member nations of the United Nations .\nHis first address to the General Assembly was vintage Trump \u2013 a 40-minute mixture of bombast , insults , threats , praise for the ideals of the UN , and a declaration of his belief that America \u2019 s pursuit of its own interests was in America \u2019 s best interests and the world \u2019 s . The speech , which Mr. Trump read from a teleprompter , was also long on contradictions and short on proposals for solving the threats he denounced .\nMaking headlines was Mr. Trump \u2019 s most explicit warning to date to North Korea about its continuing efforts to develop nuclear weapons that could reach the U.S . The president warned that America would \u201c totally destroy \u201d North Korea if forced to \u201c defend itself or its allies. \u201d Though that declaration elicited gasps from the diplomats and criticism from the media , it was a more explicit version of his earlier threat that Pyongyang would be met with \u201c fire and fury \u201d if it continued threatening America and its allies with its nuclear and missile tests . In vintage Trumpian form , he mocked North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a \u201c rocket man \u201d on a \u201c suicide mission. \u201d Demanding the \u201c denuclearization \u201d of the peninsula , Mr. Trump did not call for a resumption of negotiations to achieve that goal .\nHe also took aim at the \u201c rogue \u201d states and movements that threaten American security and world peace -- \u201c radical Islamic terrorism , \u201d a term he has only intermittently deployed . And he criticized what he called the \u201c rogue regimes \u201d of Iran , Syria , Venezuela , and Cuba , calling upon his \u201c fellow leaders to join the United States in the fight to defeat \u201d their threats to peace .\nSingling out Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by name , he accused Venezuela \u2019 s leader of starving his own people and transforming his once oil-rich country into a land of desperation and corruption . He said he was prepared to take \u201c further action \u201d against the regime , but offered no hint of what that might include .\nMr. Trump bashed Iran and the nuclear deal as \u201c one of the worst and most one-sided \u201d transactions the nation has ever entered into -- an \u201c embarrassment. \u201d While he stopped short of rejecting the agreement , he clearly hinted that the U.S. might walk away from it , setting the stage for an eventual rejection in October .\nIn each of these cases , however , Mr. Trump offered no specific proposals for countering the threat he claims they pose . And several diplomats noted the inherent contradiction in Mr. Trump \u2019 s attack on North Korea for failing to negotiate an end to its nuclear program and his near abandonment of Iran \u2019 s agreement suspending its nuclear efforts , a deal monitored and endorsed by the UN . While calling for world help in isolating North Korea -- and praising Russia and China for cutting off some fuel to Pyongyang -- he seemed prepared to go it alone to counter Iran \u2019 s alleged nuclear ambitions .\nThe president \u2019 s speech elicited some applause from the assembled diplomats , but mostly uncomfortable silence . His shrill tone and bombast was reminiscent of his campaign rallies . But his base undoubtedly welcomed his assertion that the rogue states menacing America \u2019 s and world stability were \u201c going to hell , \u201d and that America was being \u201c taken advantage of \u201d in paying 22 percent of the UN \u2019 s expenses . He highlighted the hypocrisy of the appointment of some of the world \u2019 s worst human rights abusers to the UN \u2019 s human rights council . While praising Jordan , Turkey , and Lebanon for caring for \u201c horribly treated \u201d Syrian refugees , he suggested that America would take few more of them . For the cost of settling one refugee in the U.S. , he said , ten refugees could be resettled closer to home .\nThe president \u2019 s maiden speech to the UN was really two speeches .
