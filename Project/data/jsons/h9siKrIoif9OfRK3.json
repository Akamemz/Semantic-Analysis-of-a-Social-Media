Zero Democrats voted for it .\nHouse Democrats spent most of the afternoon lambasting their Republican colleagues for dropping the food stamp component , making clear that House Speaker John Boehner would need to rely on Republicans only to pass the bill . After some marathon nose-counting , GOP leaders were able to minimize the number of Republican defectors -- just 12 Republicans voted against it on Thursday .\nThe farm bill historically has been a vehicle for both billions in farm subsidies and billions in food stamps . Twinning the two massive programs has in the past helped win support from rural-state lawmakers and those representing big cities .

The Democratic-led Senate overwhelmingly passed a farm bill with smaller cuts to food stamps , but would be reluctant to go along with a bill that carves out food stamps .\nSenate Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow , D-Mich. , said splitting the bill would be a `` major mistake '' -- though she has also indicated a willingness to try building off anything the House passes .\nThe White House has vowed to veto .
