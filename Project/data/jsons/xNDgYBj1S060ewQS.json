Sure , the articles of impeachment may not cover his worst crimes , but hey , we can turn it all to our advantage .

Yes , Trump is awful , and it would be a blessing to be rid of him . He \u2019 s a bigot , a grifter , and a would-be authoritarian . But impeaching him less than a year before the election is not the answer to much of anything . It \u2019 s a distraction from ejecting him in the most definitive way possible : beating him decisively in an election .\nIt \u2019 s telling that Joe Biden is named in the articles of impeachment . For the Democratic leadership , Trump \u2019 s worst offenses \u2014 the caging of children , the apologetics for Nazis , the fealty to asset-strippers and plutocrats , the endless vulgarities \u2014 were unpleasant but not fatal . Despite all those offenses , they didn \u2019 t begrudge him an extension of the Patriot Act , which is a funny set of powers to grant to someone so awful .

These are the least of Trump \u2019 s offenses , but they \u2019 re what really move the party leadership .

Whatever its origins , Pelosi , a highly skilled politician in the short-term tactical sense , turned it into a defense of the old order . There \u2019 s no chance the Senate will convict Trump , as Mitch McConnell has made clear .
