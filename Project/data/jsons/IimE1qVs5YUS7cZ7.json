    "content": "Like an HR meeting convened in hell , the whole Ukraine impeachment saga is boring , hard to understand , and apparently goes on for eternity . It never ends .\nWashington endured , and the rest of America ignored , yet another round of it on Wednesday . The hearings consumed virtually every hour of Wednesday 's available daylight and elevated to international celebrity this country 's current ambassador to the European Union , a man called Gordon Sondland .\nIn contrast to other recent witnesses , Sondland was n't obviously hostile to the administration . In fact , he was appointed directly by President Trump . He was also a major Trump donor . So , given those two facts , Sondland 's opening statement this morning initially looked like a complete disaster for the administration .\nKEN STARR ON IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS SO FAR : WE 'RE 'NOWHERE CLOSE ' TO IMPEACHABLE OFFENSES\nGordon Sondland , U.S. ambassador to European Union : I know that members of this committee frequently framed these complicated issues in the form of a simple question , `` Was there a quid pro quo ? '' As I testified previously , with regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting , the answer is , `` Yes . ''\nSo that 's how the morning began . `` The answer is , 'Yes , ' '' said Gordon Sondland . `` There was a quid pro quo . '' And not only that , he explained , pretty much everybody knew about it .\nSondland : Everyone was in the loop . It was no secret . Everyone was informed via email on July 19th , days before the presidential call .\nHoly smokes ! For a moment there , it looked like case closed . The final ignominious end of the Trump presidency , the one that our perpetually excitable friends in the news media have been confidently predicting day after rage-filled day , for more than three years now . The last meltdown -- the great Orange Hindenburg finally bursts into flames .\nIn TV studios across midtown Manhattan , cable news contributors struggled to hold back tears of joy . And then Adam Schiff took the microphone .\nSchiff , as the ringmaster of this particular circus , was determined to bring it to its final theatrical close . `` Tell us , '' Adam Schiff said , `` about President Trump 's deal with Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden in return for foreign aid . ''\nIt was the moment Democrats had been waiting for . But , when it finally arrived , Gordon Sondland would n't read from the script .\nAdam Schiff , chairman of the House Intelligence Committee : Though President Trump claimed to you there was no quid pro quo , he also made it clear to you in that call that President Zelensky had to `` clear things up and do it in public . '' You do n't have a reason to dispute that 's what you told --\nSondland : I do n't have any reason to dispute the `` clear things up and do it in public . '' What I 'm trying to be very clear about was President Trump never told me directly that the aid was tied to that statement .\nSchiff : But in that same conversation you had with him about the aid , about the quid pro quo , he told you that President Zelensky had to `` clear things up and do it in public , '' correct ?\nSondland : I did not have a conversation with him about the aid . I had a conversation with him as referenced in my text about quid pro quo .\nSchiff : Well , the quid pro quo you were discussing was over the aid , correct ?\nSondland : No . President Trump -- when I asked him the open-ended question , as I testified previously , `` What do you want from Ukraine , '' his answer was , `` I want nothing . I want no quid pro quo . Tell Zelensky to do the right thing . '' That 's all I got from President Trump .\nSo , they pushed him , and they pushed him , and they pushed him again , but Gordon Sondland would not , in the end , mouth Adam Schiff 's talking points . Well , why not ?\nMaybe because he did n't have any evidence that they were true .\nAs Sondland conceded in the exchange with Congressman Michael Turner , his assessment of any deals Trump may have struck with Ukraine was based mostly on assumptions .\nU.S. Rep. Mike Turner , R-Ohio : No one on this planet told you that President Trump was tying aid to investigations - yes or no ?\nTurner : So , you really have no testimony today that ties President Trump to a scheme to withhold aid from Ukraine in exchange for these investigations ?\nThis is tiresome . And of course , we apologize for it as we have in nights ' past . But since it 's happening , we feel duty-bound to explain it .\nSo a presumption . Now , some presumptions are correct . Others are laughably wrong . But one thing a presumption definitely is n't is evidence . You ca n't overturn an election based on a presumption . You ca n't stage an impeachment on presumptions . You need facts to do that . And as the day went on , Sondland introduced a new fact : the president , Gordon Sondland told us , had told him explicitly that he , in fact , did n't want a quid pro quo with Ukraine .\nU.S. Rep Jim Jordan , R-Ohio : You said to the president of the United States , `` What do you want from Ukraine ? '' The president : `` I want nothing . I want no quid pro quo . I want Zelensky to do the right thing . I want him to do what he ran on . ''\nWhy did n't you put that statement in your opening statement ? I think you said you could n't fit it in . Is that right ? Instead , we might be here for 46 minutes instead of 45 minutes ?\nIt 's a fair question , actually . So why was n't that fact -- and it 's not a small point , by the way . It 's the point on which the entire impeachment hangs . Why was n't that point included in Sondland 's opening statement ? Well , we do n't know , really , but here 's one possible explanation .\nThe statement was likely drafted by Sondland 's legal team . All four of his attorneys -- it turns out , because we checked -- are Democratic donors . The man seated next to Gordon Sondland today during the hearing , that would be a man called Robert Luskin . He has given over $ 130,000 to the Democrats over the years . Luskin also represented the FBI informant , Stefan Halper during the Russia hoax not too long ago .\nYes , a lot of people in Washington despise Donald Trump . But still , to this moment , nobody can prove a crime .\nSo is it possible that someone like Luskin was thinking about more than his client 's personal interests in this case ? Could impeaching public enemy No . 1 have crossed his mind ? We do n't know , but it does n't seem implausible .\nWe should also point out something that the press conveniently overlooked in its analysis Wednesday for the most part . Gordon Sondland and his family have been under intense political pressure -- in some cases , scary political pressure -- from the left for weeks .\nProtesters have swarmed Gordon Sondland and his family in public . Democratic politicians have endorsed boycotts -- pushed boycotts -- of his businesses , his livelihood . In other words , the left has been working the refs . And that should n't surprise you because , for the left , this is total war .\nAnd yet , in this one case , it did n't quite work . By the close of business today , we were back right where we were when the Ukraine circus started . In fact , we 're back where we were on November 9 , 2016 .\nYes , a lot of people in Washington despise Donald Trump . But still , to this moment , nobody can prove a crime . Do n't tell the press , though . They 're celebrating as if someone did .\nJeffrey Toobin , CNN legal analyst : Now we know that every fantasy about how corrupt this administration was is actually true .\nBrian Williams , MSNBC anchor : For our live coverage of the blowtorch testimony this morning from Gordon Sondland -- [ he ] turns out to be the guy that has offered the most stunning testimony .\nAri Melber , MSNBC anchor : In addition to that and the bombshells we 've heard about , this was an IED from Mr. Sondland .\nNicolle Wallace , MSNBC anchor : As you said , taking a blowtorch to even the defense Donald Trump has offered -- we do n't say this very often anymore , because it 's rarely true , but I think today changed everything .\nSo , you heard it . `` Bombshells , IEDs , blowtorches . '' Who writes the metaphors for these hair hats ? It sounds like Wednesday 's hearing was taking place in ISIS territory , in the caliphate . But the really telling line comes from the CNN legal analyst -- and we 're quoting now : `` Every fantasy about how corrupt this administration was is actually true . ''\nSo pause for a minute and think about what he 's telling you . All of the fantasies the press has held without evidence are true based on testimony from another person who does n't have evidence .\nSo you remember the Russia collusion story ? Remember Stormy Daniels ? Remember every totally baseless -- and in some cases , insane -- allegation that people like CNN 's legal analyst Toobin invented and promoted and used to try to affect elections and , in so doing , destroyed lives ? Well , they 're telling us that all of them were true because of our presumptions . That 's the most revealing thing in all of this .\nFrom the beginning , Washington has had `` presumptions '' about what the new president was like , about what policies voters were allowed to choose . Voters were n't allowed to end foreign wars by casting a ballot , or to put America first , or to secure America 's borders .\nThat 's not on the table . Those are n't menu options . This is n't a real democracy , according to the people who administer the democracy .\nAnd , by the way , that ought to make you nervous . You come to Washington , the city that 's in charge of our democracy , and no one believes in it ? You 're like -- if you showed up in Detroit and everyone 's driving a Japanese car , would it make you nervous ? It would .\nAnd they do n't believe in it . And so , what they 're really saying to voters is you ca n't actually make changes to American policies , the ones that we support . All you 're allowed to do is rubber-stamp the current status quo , the one that enriches private equity managers and defense contractors and parasites in the vast federal bureaucracy -- our donors and friends . Other than that , shut up and obey .\nSo that 's their program . And maybe they 'll succeed in the end . Maybe they 'll remove the president . OK. What then ?\nWell , Washington will celebrate , of course . But will they have learned anything from the exercise ? Will the 2016 election have changed their minds or their priorities at all , in any way ? Or will they continue to console themselves with the whole thing was just some weird aberration run by Russia and racists in the heartland . Something that they can safely ignore and return to a kind of arrangement that looks very much like 1998 -- or 1978 for that matter .\nWell , you know the answer to that . If the people in charge were capable of learning anything , our country would n't look like it does today .\nAdapted from Tucker Carlson 's monologue from `` Tucker Carlson Tonight '' on Nov. 20 , 2019 .",
