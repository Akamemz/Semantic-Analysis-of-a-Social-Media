    "content": "Guatemalan men walk from a deportation flight after being sent back from the United States on May 30 , 2019 , in Guatemala City .\nPablo , who requested to use a pseudonym for fear of threats , was quickly thrust into the Trump administration \u2019 s new \u201c safe third country \u201d program . Border officials selected him , gave him a form that said he was eligible for a policy sending asylum-seekers to Guatemala , and afforded him a short phone call with an asylum officer who reviewed his case .\nThe immigrants were told they could no longer gain protection in the US . They would have to settle in Guatemala , a country also racked by poverty , violence , and instability , whose own citizens made up a sizable portion of those arrested at the southern border last year .\nPablo , 23 , had hoped to find safety and start a new life in the US . What he did not know when he was arrested after crossing the border into Texas in December was that he had placed himself on the front lines of an unprecedented effort by the Trump administration to dissuade immigrants from El Salvador and Honduras from seeking asylum in the US .\nSitting in a jet streaming toward Guatemala , watching the landscape shift below , Pablo replayed the scenes that had led to this moment . He recalled the day he fled his home in El Salvador rather than face the danger he felt being a gay man . He considered the sacrifices he had made over the yearlong journey to the United States\u2013Mexico border .\nHe said he tried to explain to the officer that he had not only already traveled through Guatemala on his way to the US but had faced harassment there . He told the officer he didn \u2019 t want to go back .\nPablo was still hopeful , he said , as he waited in government custody in mid-December . He had heard of others , including his cousin , who had crossed into the US earlier in the year and were eventually released and given the chance to make their asylum case in front of an immigration judge . But that hope evaporated the moment he was led to a government plane , accompanied by other asylum-seekers from El Salvador and Honduras .\n\u201c It \u2019 s all a big farce , \u201d he said in an interview . \u201c Why ? I was feeling really deceived \u2014 all of my sacrifice had been in vain . Now I \u2019 m being thrown to Guatemala [ where I won \u2019 t be protected ] . I was feeling broken about the situation . \u201d\nPablo spoke to \u2588\u2588\u2588 from a home in Jalisco , Mexico , where he is waiting after fleeing Guatemala . Now he hopes to get back to the US through a different route : as the lead plaintiff in a high-stakes lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Immigrant Justice Center that seeks to block the implementation of the Guatemala policy and allow those already sent there to return to the US .\nThe experience of Pablo and others who spoke to \u2588\u2588\u2588 is a window into one of the most unusual and severe immigration programs implemented by a president who has said he wants Congress to \u201c get rid of the whole asylum system . \u201d\nConfusion and panic surrounding key aspects of the policy \u2014 like how asylum-seekers can bypass being sent to Guatemala \u2014 has spread to not only those in custody but also attorneys along the border and elsewhere . Asylum officers who spoke with \u2588\u2588\u2588 said it \u2019 s nearly impossible for people to avoid the program by proving they will face danger in Guatemala .\nPablo has spent his entire young adulthood in search of safety , peace , and a place where he can be open about his sexual orientation . He left El Salvador because his life was in danger , and he knew Guatemala and Mexico were similarly dangerous for him as a gay man , said Keren Zwick , litigation director at the NIJC .\n\u201c Like so many people who have been shut out from safety by this administration , Pablo believed the United States would provide him safety , \u201d she said .\nThe Trump administration has so far deported more than 300 people , including families , from El Salvador and Honduras to Guatemala since the safe third country program was launched in late November . The administration has hailed the effort , one of many to restrict asylum , as part of the reason why numbers of those arrested at the border continue to dip .\nSenior administration officials have also framed the policy as an opportunity for asylum-seekers to seek protection closer to their home countries .\n\u201c We are building protections that will be available to the region \u2019 s vulnerable populations closer to home \u2014 eliminating the need to make the dangerous journey north and lining the pockets of transnational criminal organizations , \u201d acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said in December .\nDHS officials say the asylum-seekers are fine with going to Guatemala : \u201c All asylum-seekers who are sent to Guatemala have chosen to go , \u201d an agency spokesperson said .\nBut attorneys representing those sent there say the choice is a false one : Asylum applicants are told they can either be deported to the country they fled or go to Guatemala .\n\u201c This is not a true \u2018 choice. \u2019 The plaintiffs in the case , as well as others we interviewed , made it plain that the option of remaining in the United States to seek asylum was never presented as a viable option , \u201d Zwick said .\nAnd privately , US Citizenship and Immigration Services asylum officers have raised concerns with not only being involved with the program \u2014 something several have called a violation of human rights \u2014 but whether Guatemala has the infrastructure to adequately screen asylum cases and protect those who arrive . For other officers , the idea that asylum-seekers are being sent to a country where more than 200,000 of its own citizens fled to the US\u2013Mexico border last year is shocking .\n\u201c This program generally does not allow applicants to access attorneys , does not provide information on how to access legal support , does not provide extensive information on their rights in the process , it does not provide extra care or consideration to people who speak Spanish as a second language , \u201d said one asylum officer , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren \u2019 t authorized to speak publicly on the matter . \u201c The US government needs to seriously consider if perpetrating human rights violations [ of asylum seekers ] is worth reducing the number of people who are paroled into the US . \u201d\nEven the US government 's own training materials for officers detail the perils people face in Guatemala , including gangs , violence , and killings with \u201c high levels of impunity. \u201d The guide , which was obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 , relies primarily on public sources : academic publications , news reports , and research from Human Rights Watch and other organizations .\nOne section of the resource guide links to a 2012 report by the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission , which states that LGBTQ people in Guatemala suffer \u201c cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment , including a constant threat of violence that amounts to torture , forced disappearances , sexual violence in detention centres and non-consensual medical testing . \u201d\nPablo saw the nascent asylum infrastructure in Guatemala firsthand when he was sent there one morning in mid-December .
