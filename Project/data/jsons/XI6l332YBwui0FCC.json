    "authors": "Marco Rubio",
    "content": "When we make engagement with the odious leaders of these countries our foreign policy , we make a Faustian bargain that is contrary to our national values and also to our strategic interests .\nInstead of the administration \u2019 s approach \u2014 one-sided concessions that have served only to reward Cuba \u2019 s rulers despite their lack of reform \u2014 we should be stating clearly what reforms America expects before we deepen ties .\nWe should reinforce our longstanding policy that Cuba must address millions of dollars worth of outstanding property claims and judgments . Individuals designated as domestic terrorists by the F.B.I . should be returned to the United States to face justice . Most important , all political prisoners must be released , and political reforms begun , so that Cubans can enjoy their fundamental freedoms .\nHow do we achieve this ? By standing firm in our commitment to the Cuban people . By increasing the support for independent civil society groups and activists and radio broadcasts that the regime wants to end . By blocking Cuban officials who have committed or overseen human-rights violations from traveling to the United States . Just as we have stood on the right side of history against the repression of other totalitarian regimes , we owe the Cuban people more time so we can get it right and not worsen their situation .\nIf the Castros \u2014 President Ra\u00fal and his elder brother Fidel \u2014 realized that they would be able to profit only by reforming and allowing more political and economic openness , increased United States engagement might make a difference . Otherwise , Mr. Obama \u2019 s policy will lead only to a deepening of repression .\nThis is why so many dissidents in Cuba are denouncing Mr. Obama \u2019 s move as a betrayal . They know that the Castro family and other relatives control all the economic levers already , and will surely reap the benefits once American businesses , driven by the desire for economic gain at all costs , and American tourists , tempted by this newspaper \u2019 s idealized version of hip Havana , flock to Cuba .\nIt is the ruling oligarchs who stand to benefit from Mr. Obama \u2019 s opening to Cuba , not the Cuban people .
