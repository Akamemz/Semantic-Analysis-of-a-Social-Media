    "content": "New strict abortion laws in states like Alabama and Georgia are setting the stage for a legal fight that could make its way to the Supreme Court , sparking fears that the court \u2019 s conservative majority could reverse Roe v. Wade .\nLegal experts have previously cast doubt on the possibility of the Supreme Court revisiting the landmark ruling in Roe v. Wade anytime soon . But Justice Stephen Breyer appeared to raise the possibility this week in an opinion opposing conservative justices \u2019 reversal of an unrelated 1979 ruling .\n\u201c Today \u2019 s decision can only cause one to wonder which cases the court will overrule next , \u201d Breyer wrote , in what many viewed to be a warning against a potential Roe v. Wade reversal .\nThe court overturning the 1979 ruling , coupled with Breyer \u2019 s remarks , has intensified fears among abortion rights supporters who say a conservative-leaning Supreme Court could also overturn Roe v. Wade , which legalized abortion nationwide in 1973 .\n\u201c This week the Supreme Court has shown a willingness to jettison precedent , \u201d said Carrie Flaxman , Planned Parenthood \u2019 s deputy director of public policy litigation and law . \u201c With Justice [ Brett ] Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court , there is a grave threat to abortion rights . That \u2019 s what these bills are targeted at . The sponsors of these bills are doing this , and states are doing this , because they hope that the court will overturn Roe . \u201d\nAdvocacy groups are gearing up for lawsuits over the new state laws that offer up even more avenues for an abortion case to land before the justices .\nPlanned Parenthood vowed to sue if Alabama Gov . Kay Ivey ( R ) signed into law a measure passed Tuesday by state lawmakers banning abortion , with exemptions if the life of the mother is at serious risk , but none for cases of rape or incest .\nThe American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit Wednesday challenging a law signed by Ohio Gov . Mike DeWine ( R ) that bans abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected , usually around six weeks of pregnancy .\nLegal challenges are also pending in Mississippi and Kentucky , where Republican governors have recently signed fetal heartbeat abortion laws . And a lawsuit is also likely in Georgia , where Gov . Brian Kemp ( R ) signed a similar measure last week .\nSeveral of the laws appear to be designed to force the Supreme Court to revisit a key component of Roe v. Wade that said states can \u2019 t place certain restrictions on abortion .\nHans von Spakovsky , a legal fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation , noted that Alabama \u2019 s abortion law is unlikely to hold up under the legal standard set by Roe . But he said the point of the new law is to force the Supreme Court to revisit abortion .\n\u201c I think the sponsors have made it clear that they are passing this law with a full expectation in Alabama that the lower courts will strike it down because they want this to get to the Supreme Court , because they \u2019 re hoping that it \u2019 ll be the opportunity for the Supreme Court to potentially overturn its prior precedents about this , \u201d von Spakovsky said .\nBut the justices may be wary of taking up a controversial topic like abortion , particularly during an election year when it could give the appearance of putting the issue on the ballot . The Supreme Court \u2019 s current term is wrapping up , and the next one will begin in the fall , with major rulings usually reserved for June .\nMary Ziegler , a law professor at Florida State University who specializes in reproductive rights , said the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals would likely oversee challenges to the abortion laws in Georgia and Alabama .\nShe said that appeals court appears ready to punt the question to the Supreme Court , but has been \u201c begrudgingly \u201d upholding the precedent so far .\nEven if the Supreme Court is presented with the case , the justices could decline to hear it .\n\u201c If the court doesn \u2019 t want to deal with this right now , they can easily avoid it , \u201d Ziegler said . \u201c If the lower courts are striking these laws down , they could just decide not to take a case . \u201d\nThe Supreme Court is currently considering whether to hear arguments in a handful of abortion cases , including one challenging an Indiana abortion law signed by then-Gov .
