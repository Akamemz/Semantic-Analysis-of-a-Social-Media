    "content": "Writing in Commentary not long ago , Seth Mandel drew out a nice point about the resurgence of the Democratic left : `` Complaints over the last few years about the GOP being pulled to the right by conservatives , '' he wrote , `` were not about liberals ' desire to meet in the middle and compromise , no matter how much they might decry the supposed extremist drift of the right . What they wanted was their very own Tea Party . ''\nThe Occupy movement briefly seemed to provide one , but it lacked the Tea Party 's staying power . Still , the passions that animated the Occupiers have breathed new life into the left , from the East Coast \u2014 where Bill de Blasio won election as New York 's new mayor on a promise to end economic inequalities \u2014 to the West , where Kshama Sawant , a member of the Socialist Alternative Party , won a seat on the Seattle City Council by campaigning for a $ 15 minimum wage .\nVictories like those have inspired imitation : Several candidates in the Northeast have expropriated de Blasio 's `` tale of two cities '' theme for their own campaigns , and President Obama ended 2012 with a speech calling economic inequality `` the defining issue of our time . ''\nAll of this has the liberal commentariat rapturous . The abstract notion of equality is the lodestar of the American left , just as the abstract notion of liberty is the lodestar of the right . Or at least some liberty : Most conservatives care greatly about the economic kind , and the sight of an entrepreneur caught up in red tape enrages them . But certain conservatives care less about other kinds of liberty , such as the freedom of gays and lesbians to pursue their own happiness as they define it , or the freedom of a young black male in a hoodie to walk down the street with a bag of Skittles unaccosted .\nLikewise , the left is selective in its ardor for equality . It is stirred by the cause of social equality for minority groups , and by economic equality for all . Other kinds of equality matter less \u2014 e.g. , to evangelicals , the belief that we are all equal in the eyes of God is an immensely important social leveler . To at least the secular left , this solidarity of faith seems not only insignificant but potentially malignant \u2014 an `` opiate of the masses , '' as Marx called religion generally .\nEven on the question of economic inequality , many on the left tend to focus only on one dimension : the gap between the rich and poor . Conventional liberal opinion holds that the gap is bad not only because of its consequences , but inherently \u2014 and the bigger the gap , the worse things are .\nBut that does n't follow . As self-described `` liberaltarian '' Will Wilkinson noted in a 2009 paper , U.S. inequality as measured by the Gini Coefficient ( the most common measure of such inequality ) is about the same as in Ghana . But being poor in the U.S. is much better than being poor \u2013 or for that matter rich \u2013 in Ghana . This raises another point Wilkinson makes , about consumption : When you look at how people actually live , what they have in the bank matters much less than their daily experience .\nThe difference between having a car of any kind or none at all is vastly greater than the difference between having a used Chevy and a new Porsche . And while the rich in the U.S. have gotten richer , so have the poor : Since 1979 the income of the poorest 20 percent of Americans has almost doubled , and market economics has provided them with riches , such as cellphones , once available only to the most well-off . This helps explain why the difference in happiness among income groups in the U.S. is vastly smaller than the difference in wealth . Which of those measures should matter more ?\nFocusing only on inequalities of result also ignores another important dimension to the question . Again , Wilkinson : `` It 's not enough to identify a mechanism of rising inequality . An additional argument is required to show that there is some kind of injustice or wrongdoing involved . ''\nIt is possible that inequality is rising because the system has grown more rigged . But as Mickey Kaus pointed out recently , while you would expect inequality in a rigged system , you also should expect it in a fair one : `` Once the meritocratic centrifuge has sorted everyone out , there wo n't be that many talented people at the bottom to rise in heartening success stories . '' Divining how much truth there is in these competing narratives is vastly more complex than ideologues of any stripe would like to think .\nCorrecting inequalities caused by system-rigging is desirable , but `` correcting '' ( as opposed to merely alleviating ) inequalities caused by merit-sorting would actually be unjust . It also would require creating an inequality of a different sort : the inequality of authority .\nPerpetual market interventions in the name of economic equality require a perpetual class of interveners who have the power to overrule the free choices made by everyone else .\nNaturally , those coercive interventions require handing the levers of coercion over to progressives \u2014 which explains why this sort of inequality never seems to bother them in the slightest .",
