That scary guy in Pennsylvania .\nThe world seems like a pretty big mess right now .\nPolls indicate Americans care less about climate change than pretty much anything . Even among those of us who are inclined to care about the planet , there 's the holy-crap-I-can't-even-deal-with-it factor . It seems too big , too daunting -- and like so much damage is already being done .\nBut I put those doubts completely to rest on Sunday as I wove through hopeful crowds of thousands at the People 's Climate March in New York , which was billed by organizers as the biggest rally against climate change world has ever seen . There was no independent estimate of the size of the crowd immediately available , but organizers said as many as 310,000 people attended -- many from far reaches of the globe , ahead of a UN climate summit here this week .\nWorld leaders are expected to discuss the topic and , hopefully , build momentum for more-concrete climate talks in Paris next year . Climate marches also were held on Sunday in 2,800 other locations , according to organizers , from Paris to Port Moresby , Papua New Guinea .\nIn a world disinclined to care about the urgent threat of climate change , these were the people who are both experiencing the crisis -- right now , not 100 years in the future -- and who also believe there 's still time to make a difference .\n`` I am fearful , but for the most part , I 'm optimistic , '' said Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner , a 26-year-old who came to New York from the Marshall Islands , in the Pacific . Sea level rise already is washing away grave sites and lashing homes on the islands , she said . She came to New York in part to represent her 7-month-old daughter , who she hopes will be able to live on the island , rather than relocate . `` I see this movement and I see this march and I see all these thousands of people coming together for climate change ; I believe there are things we can do to change the world .\nIt 's not possible for her to ignore this issue like the rest of us .\n`` The thing you have to imagine is the ocean is huge next to our islands , '' she told me . `` Our islands are completely tiny ... You do n't get to forget how vulnerable you are . ''\nThe march , which wandered along the edge of Central Park and through the streets of Midtown Manhattan , took on the feel of a celebration for a planet that 's worth saving rather than a funeral for one already lost .\nI saw accordions , drums , a giant-dancing-puppet representation of Mother Earth . The mood was a bit surprising considering some climate scientists and policy experts say the world already has acted far too slowly to curb carbon emissions and that we 're locked into some level of harmful warming . The atmosphere already has warmed about 1-degree Celsius because of people , said Bill McKibben , co-founder of 350.org , which helped organize the events . `` That 's enormous , '' he told me . `` It 's been enough already to melt the summer Arctic '' and to increase ocean acidification by 30 % . `` As astonishing as those changes are , they are a very small trailer for the horror movie that 's coming if we do n't act quickly , '' he said .\nAnd that 's what people here were calling for : Quick , assured action . A reduction in harmful carbon emissions . Real targets , based on science . New , clean industry . A revolution , really -- an economy that looks beyond the fossil era .
