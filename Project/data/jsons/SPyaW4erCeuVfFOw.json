Instead , she wrote a column attacking Clinton .\nPonder that for a moment . The soon-to-be first woman nominee in the history of the United States was facing a sexist pig who claimed the Democrat had once gotten `` schlonged , '' and Marcus ' first instinct as a Post columnist was to write a piece belittling Clinton for playing the victim\u2014for manufacturing `` outrage '' \u2014while claiming Trump 's wildly sexist rhetoric was `` awfully mild .
