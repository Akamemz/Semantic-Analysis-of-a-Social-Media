    "content": "Viewers have been able to watch live as Senate Republicans indulge , and Democrats cross-examine , Donald Trump \u2019 s nominees for his cabinet . Within a 24-hour period Tuesday and Wednesday , three of the most controversial and quite possibly the least qualified of these nominees paraded across the screen in a cavalcade of misstatements , lapses of judgment , conflicts of interest and from time to time spectacular displays of ignorance and insensitivity .\nWhere to begin ? Our pick is Betsy DeVos , the nominee to be education secretary , whose energies and considerable family wealth have been devoted to promoting privately run charter schools at the expense of traditional public schools in her home state , Michigan . She refused multiple times to agree that traditional public and charter schools should be held to the same level of accountability . She seemed unaware of some of the basic functions of the education department . She seemed surprised to learn , when Senator Al Franken brought up the matter , of a long-running debate over whether and to what extent to use test scores to measure student achievement or student growth .\nShe also won the tin ear award hands down . When Christopher Murphy asked whether she would agree that schools are no place for guns , she did not give the obvious right answer to a Democratic senator whose state suffered the horrendous Sandy Hook massacre ( \u201c Senator , there is no place for guns in schools \u201d ) . Instead she said that localities should decide , and \u2014 in a transcendently odd moment \u2014 suggested that schools in places like Wyoming might need a gun \u201c to protect from potential grizzlies . \u201d\nNext up , Scott Pruitt , who as Oklahoma attorney general initiated endless lawsuits against the Environmental Protection Agency , which he \u2019 s been asked to run , and who very nearly matched Ms. DeVos in the wrong answer department . One Democrat after another asked whether he would recuse himself in cases involving those lawsuits and cases involving companies that contributed copiously to his campaigns . The obvious response was , \u201c Of course I will ! \u201d Instead , Mr. Pruitt would only say that he would do so if the agency ethics officer tells him to . Mr. Pruitt \u2019 s answer to climate change questions was equally depressing . Nearly all mainstream scientists say that human activities have been largely responsible for the rise in global atmospheric temperatures . Mr. Pruitt \u2019 s response was that the jury was still out .",
