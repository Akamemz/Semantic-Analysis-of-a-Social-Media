    "content": "The National Rifle Association offered free help to schools that hire armed guards to protect their students and backed expansion of the federal government \u2019 s list of banned guy buyers , but it defiantly warned Thursday against Washington \u2019 s overreach after last week \u2019 s school massacre .\nExecutive Vice President and CEO Wayne LaPierre said FBI bungling , mental illness and lax school security were at the root of the Valentine \u2019 s Day shooting that left 17 dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School . He said the solution is better protection , not tighter gun laws .\n\u201c Our banks , our airports , our NBA games , our NFL games , our office buildings , our movie stars , our politicians \u2014 they \u2019 re all more protected than our children at school . Does that make any sense to anybody ? \u201d Mr. LaPierre told a Washington audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference , a gathering of grass-roots leaders on the right .\nHis annual speech to CPAC is always compelling , but this year \u2019 s version was all the more so because of the timing , giving Mr. LaPierre a chance to respond to the NRA \u2019 s critics , a group that now includes many of the students who survived the Florida shooting . Some of the survivors are leading a nationwide effort to enact strict controls on what weapons can be bought and who can buy them .\nMr. LaPierre , though , warned against \u201c opportunists \u201d using the tragedy to advance a \u201c socialist agenda \u201d that begins with denying gun rights . He said the response to the shooting should be careful and targeted .\n\u201c Demand what works , \u201d he said . \u201c Put armed security in every school . Fix the broken mental health system . Enforce the federal gun laws against every criminal thug on the street . Prosecute dangerous people when they show up to buy a gun . And , for God \u2019 s sake , put every prohibited person into the system . That \u2019 s what common-sense gun laws look like . \u201d\nHe said the NRA will provide free support through its School Shield program to help any school place armed security guards in its hallways .\nThe \u201c good guy with a gun \u201d philosophy is also being advanced by the White House . President Trump this week talked about offering bonuses to teachers who are willing to take training and then arm themselves on school grounds .\nMr. LaPierre also said his organization supports efforts to ensure that the National Instant Criminal Background Check System gets all the records it is supposed to have . He said states leave out at least 7 million felony convictions that could be in the system .\nHe also called for more prosecutions of those on the banned list who try to buy weapons .\n\u201c In 2010 , roughly 80,000 prohibited people committed a felony by trying to buy a gun . Just 44 were prosecuted for it . Does that sound like a good number to anybody ? \u201d he said . \u201c So , when you hear politicians who won \u2019 t fix the broken system talk about expanding it , don \u2019 t buy it . \u201d\nMr. LaPierre said the NRA will oppose expanding the system to include people whom the government has flagged for potential mental health problems but who have never officially been adjudicated mentally deficient . The Obama administration made several such efforts in its waning days .\nAdding more mental health records into NICS appears to be one area with broad support among people on both sides of the gun issue .\n\u201c In some of that speech , he had some good things to say about the background check system , \u201d said Avery Gardiner , co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence . \u201c That \u2019 s good \u2014 we should get more records into the background check system , absolutely . \u201d\nMs. Gardiner also said , though , that the NRA supported a legal effort during the 1990s challenging the entire Brady gun bill \u2014 which initially set up the background check system \u2014 as unconstitutional .\nSome of the students from Stoneman Douglas have made the NRA their chief target in the aftermath of the shooting . They have taken to Twitter and crusading cable news networks to criticize those who have worked with the gun rights group and vowed to deny them funding .\nMr. LaPierre , though , criticized \u201c the shameful politicization of tragedy \u201d by Democrats and the news media .\n\u201c They hate the NRA . They hate the Second Amendment . They hate individual freedom , \u201d he said . \u201c Their goal is to eliminate the Second Amendment . \u201d\nHe name-checked a handful of potential 2020 Democratic presidential contenders as among those opponents : Sens . Kamala D. Harris of California , Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts , and Cory A. Booker of New Jersey , as well as New York Gov .
