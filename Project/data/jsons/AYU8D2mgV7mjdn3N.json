It \u2019 s the UK City of Culture 2017 , derelict buildings and dry docks are being refurbished , and a major wind turbine factory is on the rise . \u201c The planets have never been more aligned , \u201d says David Keel , chair of C4DI , a new incubator and co-working space in the waterside Fruit Market district .\nGoing against the dominant narrative that \u201c Brexit \u201d towns are depressed and in deep regret , Hull has turned toward a hopeful future \u2013 for some because of Brexit , for others despite it .\nAs Article 50 is triggered by British Prime Minister Theresa May on March 29 , officially beginning Britain \u2019 s divorce from the EU , Britons and their EU counterparts are nervous about facing an unprecedented challenge with huge economic and political implications , including the integrity of the United Kingdom . But expectations in this city are bubbling .\nTo understand the optimism , Simon Lee , a senior lecturer in politics at the University of Hull who is writing a book called \u201c The State of England : The Nation We \u2019 re In , \u201d says it \u2019 s important to recognize the motivation behind Brexit here as the ultimate protest of a city forgotten and left to feed on its maritime past . And Hull \u2019 s experience is a lesson in the defeating power of nostalgia and how towns that have been left behind by the political and economic forces of the 21st century are struggling for economic and cultural redemption .\n\u201c Hull has not yet found a replacement identity , \u201d says Professor Lee .\nNow the question , he says , is whether the City of Culture designation , and some of Hull \u2019 s other signs of economic and cultural renewal , will engender a new identity for the city . Some say they believe the outcome of the EU referendum might have been different had regeneration come earlier .\nIn early January , a 75-meter ( 82-yard ) wind turbine blade slashed Hull \u2019 s Queen Victoria Square in half . The \u201c Blade \u201d was one of the first art installations to kick off the UK City of Culture celebration , but it \u2019 s also a nod to what is equally significant for Hull : a \u00a3310 million ( $ 385 million ) Siemens turbine blade factory that \u2019 s created 1,000 jobs and could help position Hull \u2019 s offshore wind industry as a global player in renewable energy .\nIt \u2019 s one of several major investments to come to Hull in the past five years , and it marks a pivot for a city that was voted one of England \u2019 s \u201c worst places to live \u201d in 2003 . In March , The Sunday Times named it one of the best places to live in the UK .\nThe turnabout has led to some head-scratching over why Hull voted to \u201c Leave \u201d the EU with one of the country \u2019 s highest percentages \u2013 as well as whether timing made a difference .\nSARA MILLER LLANA/THE \u2588\u2588\u2588 Catchy phrases that underline the optimism in Hull , England , greet visitors at the train station .\nImmigration played its role here , as it did everywhere in Britain . Bypassed by some of the earlier post-colonial waves of migration , Hull saw its share of Eastern Europeans swell after the 2004 enlargement of the EU . And residents grumble about their fears that wages and the quality of education are going down because of it .\nBut a bigger factor was an anti-establishment protest in a place that saw its livelihood lost over the \u201c Cod Wars \u201d of the 1970s with Iceland . That killed off its deep-sea fishing industry in the North Sea , right as Britain joined the EU and became subject to the bloc \u2019 s common fisheries policy . For 40 years , the city has been managing a declining economy with the perception that neither Westminster nor Brussels cared .\nHull sits at the end of the train line . Poet Philip Larkin once said it was a place that only traveling salesmen or relatives would visit , recounts Russ Litten , a contemporary author and poet , during a walk around the marina on a recent day .\nComing from a family of fishermen who spent their lives on trawlers , Mr. Litten taps the psyche of the people in works like \u201c My People Come From the Sea , \u201d a poem set to electronic music . Hull is both a fiercely proud town \u2013 almost everyone tells visitors about its refusal to allow King Charles I through the city \u2019 s Beverley Gate in 1642 , the starting point of the English civil war \u2013 and a forgotten place . It was one of the most bombed cities of World War II , but residents lament that hardly anyone knows that . It \u2019 s made them a stubborn and contrarian lot , says Litten . \u201c If you give them a binary choice , Hull people will always vote no . They \u2019 ll say , \u2018 The answer is no ; now what \u2019 s the question ? \u2019 \u201d he says .\nDespite rejuvenation , both cultural and economic , official unemployment levels for Hull in September 2016 were nearly double those of Britain overall , while 12.5 percent of the population has no vocational or academic qualifications , compared with 8.6 percent for the national average . It also has fewer people with the highest qualifications : 22 percent compared with 37 percent nationally . \u201c There is a disconnect between regenerating buildings and the regeneration of the population , \u201d says Lee .\nSuch disparities are getting another look in the face of Brexit . New research that Annie Quick of the New Economics Foundation in London helped conduct on inequality and well-being shows that while average well-being within a community did not predict the number of people who voted to leave the EU , high well-being inequality did . Hull is on the top 10 list of well-being inequality .\nMs. Quick says that more analysis needs to be done to fully understand the data , but the findings might be telling policymakers about the sentiments of feeling \u201c left behind \u201d that have become so prominent since the vote . \u201c The experience of really struggling with your life , and being [ further ] down on the well-being scale in a community in which other people have a higher well-being , can really exacerbate that feeling of being left behind , \u201d she says .\nYet at C4DI , where pop music pumps into the reception area , Mr. Keel wonders if Hull would have voted for Brexit \u2013 or at least with such a wide margin for Leave \u2013 had some of the current changes happened sooner or the vote later . \u201c I think if the vote would have happened in a year \u2019 s time , there would have been a significantly increased awareness of the value of connecting to a wider world in Hull than there was when the vote took place , \u201d he says .\nDespite the official triggering of Article 50 , Britain will remain in a state of prolonged expectation for the time being . It \u2019 s the beginning of a two-year negotiation that is expected to decide Britain \u2019 s future trading relationships , immigration policies , and budget obligations . No one knows if Brexit will ultimately be \u201c hard \u201d \u2013 meaning Britain loses access to the EU \u2019 s single market and ends free movement for EU nationals \u2013 or \u201c soft , \u201d and what that means for foreign investment and the economic outlook of the country .\nHull is polarized when it comes to those same questions .\nFor Tim Rix , the fifth-generation head of shipping company JR Rix & Sons , Brexit is Hull \u2019 s future . He has been a driving force in the revitalization of Hull , pushing for the Siemens factory , the City of Culture designation , and Brexit , he says in his office . It \u2019 s filled with replicas of the ships the company has employed since the 1800s , near the Hull River , which runs into the vast Humber Estuary .\nSince the Brexit vote last June , businesses have seen only one direct effect , the devaluation of the pound . That \u2019 s been a boon for Mr. Rix , as well as local exporters . His ships , he says , whose services are bought in pounds , suddenly have become cheaper for the Continent . He believes the talk of a hard Brexit \u2013 kicking EU nationals out and leaving the EU \u2019 s single market \u2013 is just negotiation jostling for now , though he admits that a softer Brexit will probably anger those who based their vote on the immigration question . \u201c But even if we have hard Brexit , we \u2019 ll clear the decks , we \u2019 ll sort ourselves out , and we \u2019 ll get on with it , \u201d he says confidently .\nSARA MILLER LLANA/THE \u2588\u2588\u2588 Russ Litten voted for Britain to remain in the European Union , but he \u2019 s still upbeat about Hull \u2019 s future .\nIan Kelly , chief executive of the Hull and Humber Chamber of Commerce , which officially staked a neutral position on Brexit , says there are some concerns about labor shortages , especially for agricultural companies dependent on foreign labor .\nThere are other firms that believe Brexit will boost their fortunes . \u201c There has been enormous sense of strong views on both sides .
