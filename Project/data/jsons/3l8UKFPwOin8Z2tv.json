Public health leaders also affirm the truth in Pelosi \u2019 s statement that a train will bear down on the nation before it \u2019 s over \u201c if you do not heed the advice of the scientific community about isolation ... and avoiding as much communal contact as possible \u2014 in fact none . \u201d\nYet the California Democrat , like Trump , said better days will come . She said the know-how and commitment of scientists and the money approved by Washington to find a vaccine and cure some day do constitute \u201c light at the end of the tunnel . \u201d\nThe U.S. now has well over 100,000 cases and more than 1,700 deaths , according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University , based on figures reported by governments and health authorities .\nTRUMP : \u201c I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter. \u201d \u2014 Fox News virtual town hall Tuesday .\nTRUMP : \u201c We have to open up our country , I \u2019 m sorry. \u201d \u2014 conference call with governors Tuesday , audio of which was obtained by The \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nTHE FACTS : To be clear , the federal government did not close the country and won \u2019 t be reopening it . He \u2019 s encouraging governors to do so . And against the sentiment of public health experts , he \u2019 s contending that many people can soon go back to their workplaces while still staying a safe distance from each other . The disease is highly contagious .\nRestrictions on public gatherings , workplaces , mobility , store operations , schools and more were ordered by states and communities , not Washington . The federal government has imposed border controls ; otherwise its social-distancing actions are mostly recommendations , not mandates .\nOn relaxing restrictions and returning to normal , Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health told CNN on Wednesday : \u201c You \u2019 ve got to understand that you don \u2019 t make the timeline ; the virus makes the timeline. \u201d He told that day \u2019 s White House briefing : \u201c No one is going to want to tone down anything when you see what is going on in a place like New York City . \u201d\nTRUMP : \u201c I mean , we have never closed the country before , and we have had some pretty bad flus , and we have had some pretty bad viruses. \u201d \u2014 Fox News virtual town hall Tuesday .\nThe new coronavirus is not the same as the annual flu because it \u2019 s a disease that hadn \u2019 t been seen before in humans . For that reason , human populations lack immunity to the virus . It can spread unchecked , except by measures such as social distancing .\nTRUMP : \u201c Over an eight day span , the United States now does more testing than what South Korea ( which has been a very successful tester ) does over an eight week span . Great job ! \u201d \u2014 tweet Wednesday .\nTHE FACTS : The comparison with South Korea isn \u2019 t very illuminating . The U.S. has more than six times the population of South Korea , about 330 million compared with about 50 million . Yet South Korea is testing about four times more people as a percentage of its population .\nThe two countries are also at different stages in their outbreaks . Daily case counts are rapidly rising in the U.S. , where the coronavirus took hold later on . In South Korea , the curve has been leveling off .\nThe U.S. count is going up fast in part because the virus is spreading and in part because of a test shortage that lasted weeks , as well as a backlog in laboratories reporting results . In that time , Trump falsely asserted that anyone who wanted or needed to get the test could .\nSouth Korea \u2019 s coronavirus response has been marked by an emphasis on widespread testing that earned global praise . But even in that country the government is stressing social distancing measures because of worries the outbreak could pick up again .\nTRUMP on the death rate from COVID-19 : \u201c I think it \u2019 s substantially below 1 % , because the people don \u2019 t report. \u201d \u2014 Fox News interview Thursday .\nTHE FACTS : No one knows the death rate . Fauci says it may end being roughly 1 % . If that turns out right , it would mean that the disease is 10 times deadlier than the average seasonal flu , with its death rate of about 0.1 % . Fauci \u2019 s estimate includes people whose cases are not reported .\nTRUMP : \u201c In Canada we do have troops along the border. \u201d \u2014 news briefing Thursday .\nTHE FACTS : No , the U.S. has not sent troops to police the mutual closing of the Canada-U.S. border to nonessential , noncommercial traffic . The border is controlled on both sides by nonmilitary entry stations .\n\u201c Canada and the United States have the longest unmilitarized border in the world and it is very much in both of our interests for it to remain that way , \u201d Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday .\nTRUMP : \u201c We \u2019 re the ones that gave the great response , and we \u2019 re the ones that kept China out of here . ... If I didn \u2019 t do that early call on China \u2014 and nobody wanted that to happen . Everybody thought it was just unnecessary to do it. \u201d \u2014 news briefing Wednesday .\nTRUMP : \u201c Everybody was against it . Almost everybody , I would say , was just absolutely against it . ... I made a decision to close off to China that was weeks early . ...

His decision followed a consensus by his public health advisers that the restrictions should take place .\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar , who was coordinator of the task force at the time and announced the travel restrictions , said Trump made the decision in late January after accepting the \u201c uniform recommendation of the career public health officials here at HHS . \u201d\nWhile the World Health Organization did advise against the overuse of travel restrictions , Azar told reporters in February that his department \u2019 s career health officials had made a \u201c considered recommendation , which I and the president adopted \u201d in a bid to slow spread of the virus .\nMost major airlines had already suspended flights to China prior to the announcement on Jan. 31 , following the lead of several major international carriers that had stopped due to the coronavirus outbreak . Delta , American and United cited a sharp drop in demand for the flights , and an earlier State Department advisory told Americans not to travel to China because of the outbreak .\nTRUMP , on the early China travel restrictions : \u201c And if we didn \u2019 t do that , thousands and thousands of people would have died. \u201d \u2014 news briefing Wednesday .\nTHE FACTS : The impact hasn \u2019 t been quantified . While Fauci has praised the travel restrictions on China for slowing the virus , it \u2019 s not known how big an impact they had or if \u201c thousands and thousands \u201d of lives were saved .\nTrump \u2019 s order did not fully \u201c close \u201d the U.S. off to China , as he asserts . It temporarily barred entry by foreign nationals who had traveled in China within the previous 14 days , with exceptions for the immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents . Americans returning from China were allowed back after enhanced screening at select ports of entry and for 14 days afterward . But U.S. scientists say screenings can miss people who don \u2019 t yet show symptoms of COVID-19 ; while symptoms often appear within five days or six days of exposure , the incubation period is 14 days .\nA recent study from the journal Science found China \u2019 s internal crackdown modestly delayed the spread of the virus . It cast doubt that travel restrictions elsewhere will do much compared with other preventive measures , citing in part the likelihood that a large number of people exposed to the virus had already been traveling internationally without being detected .\nFor weeks after the first U.S. case of the coronavirus was confirmed in January , government missteps caused a shortage of reliable laboratory tests for the coronavirus , leading to delays in diagnoses .\nTRUMP on the economic hit : \u201c I don \u2019 t think its going to end up being such a rough patch. \u201d \u2014 briefing Wednesday .\nEven in a best case \u2014 the pandemic subsides relatively quickly and economic growth and jobs come back without a long lag \u2014 some damage is done . The $ 2.2 trillion federal rescue package , equal to half the size of the entire federal budget , means record debt on top of the record debt that existed before the crisis .\nWhy is too much debt bad ?
