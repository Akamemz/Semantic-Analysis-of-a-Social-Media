''\nThe group raises some very valid concerns about Foxx , the state 's attorney . It was previously reported that Foxx recused herself from the Smollett case in February , but it appears she did not file the paperwork to do so officially . This meant that the judge could not appoint a special prosecutor to handle the case , and instead , Foxx 's offices continued to be principally involved in bringing Smollett to justice . Her recusal was in no sense meaningful .\nThis matters , because Foxx had been in contact with supporters and relatives of Smollett\u2014including Tina Tchen , a former aide to First Lady Michelle Obama . The relative and Foxx ostensibly discussed getting the Chicago police to turn the entire matter over to the FBI , which Foxx attempted in vain to make happen .\nTchen is not the only political friend Smollett and Foxx have in common : Sen.
