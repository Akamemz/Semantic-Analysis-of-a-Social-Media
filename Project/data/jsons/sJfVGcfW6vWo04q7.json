Or am I just grouchier?\n\nEvery day I see things that are wrong or that so miss the point I want to scream.\n\nFour examples:\n\nStorm Coverage\n\nAs this week's storm approached the East Coast, the media reverted to breathless hype: \"monster storm \u2026 very dangerous.\" Here I blame my beloved free market: Predicting scary weather works. Viewers tune in.\n\nWhat galls me more is the reporters' government-centric thinking. \"Everything is closed,\" they say. \"Employees can't get to work.\"\n\nBut the corner grocery stayed open. So did many gas stations and restaurants.\n\nWhy is it that when government buildings close, so many private businesses stay open? Because their own money is at stake.\n\nThe store's employees probably make less money than government workers. They are less likely to own all-wheel-drive cars. But they get to work. Some sleep there. Their own money is on the line.\n\nReporters don't think about the distinction.\n\nThe Deep State\n\nMonday, The New York Times ran the headline \"What Happens When You Fight a 'Deep State' that Doesn't Exist?\"\n\nThe article explained that unlike Egypt or Pakistan, America doesn't really have a powerful deep state, and to claim that it does \"presents apolitical civil servants as partisan agents.\"\n\nGive me a break. \"Apolitical civil servants\"?\n\nA deep state absolutely exists. Some call it \"administrative state\" or \"regulatory state.\" These are the people who crush innovation and freedom by issuing hundreds of new rules. Regulators, if they don't pass new rules, think they're not doing their jobs.\n\nEven \"anti-regulator\" President George W. Bush hired 90,000 new regulators. Calling them \"nonpartisan\" doesn't make them harmless\u2014it just means we put up with them through multiple administrations.\n\nEven if you exclude the military and post office, more than 20 million Americans work for the government. Because of civil service rules, it's almost impossible to fire them.\n\nThe Times calls these 20 million people \"apolitical\". Please. Most are just as partisan as you or I. Maybe more so, as leaks and signs of bureaucratic resistance to presidential edicts demonstrate.\n\nPeople who choose to work for, say, the EPA, tend to be environment zealots. This should surprise no one. Somehow, New York Times reporters don't see it.\n\n\"Chief of EPA Bucks Studies\"\n\nSpeaking of the EPA and The Times, their front page claimed President Donald Trump appointee Scott Pruitt is \"at odds with the established scientific consensus.\" That makes Pruitt sound like an anti-science idiot.
