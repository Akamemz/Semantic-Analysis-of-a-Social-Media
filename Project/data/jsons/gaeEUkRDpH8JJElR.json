    "content": "All this talk about Trump this , and Trump that , masks a far bigger political controversy . The Republican Party leadership in Washington , D.C. , has fundamentally betrayed its constituents and they are about to learn that they \u2019 ve been double-crossed \u2014 for years .\nEvery Republican candidate \u2019 s stock speech sounds the same , the thunderous roar about a government out of control , federal spending out of control ( insert charts and graphs and why , if you stack hundred dollar bills , they will reach the edge of the universe ) , federal taxes out of control ( insert comparisons to socialist countries ) , the federal bureaucracy out of control ( insert metaphors about chains , yokes , and the like ) , the family shattered with federal funding of abortion a crime against humanity ( watch for it \u2014 there ! The heart-wrenching sob ) , and our military is emasculated .\nTwo more items were added to the menu , courtesy of Obama . Obamacare Will Be Repealed ! and Illegal Immigration Will Not Stand !\nIn 2009 , the Democrats controlled everything , partly due to the Republicans \u2019 cowardice on Capitol Hill , and in part because of some of the most inept candidates and campaigns America has seen in years . The Obama folks could have played it safe but went for socialist gold , using the power of the legislative and the executive branches ( and later the judiciary , thank you Justice Roberts ) to advance their agenda .\nThat included federal spending on a level unmatched in human history resulting ultimately in a $ 19 trillion in debt we simply can not pay , and with so many tens of trillions of dollars in unfunded liabilities that \u201c infinity \u201d is not far behind . One seventh of the economy was confiscated by the federal government with the passage of Obamacare . Our national borders were declared open and discussions over our national sovereignty closed . And to top it off , the Democrats all but declared themselves above the law .\nThe GOP harrumphed that this would not stand , by God ! If only\u2026 if only America would vote them into the majority .\nIn 2009 , the Tea Party was born . The Grand Old Party was rejuvenated . Happy days were here again .\nJust one year later , the Republicans captured the House , and with that , the power of the purse . They now had the authority to stop the insane spending on so many obnoxious and wholly unnecessary ventures . They could end Obamacare simply by not funding it .\nInstead , under the \u201c leadership \u201d of John Boehner , it did absolutely nothing . Why , if only we had the Senate ! Then we could take on the President !\nSo in 2014 , after spending hundreds of millions of campaign dollars running hundreds of thousands of television and radio ads pledging to end illegal immigration while repealing Obamacare \u201c root and branch \u201d ( author : Mitch McConnell ) , they were given control of the Senate .\nAnd within a month McConnell re-authorized both , along with every single other thing Harry Reid and Obama wanted for yet another year .\nBut that \u2019 s because we can \u2019 t do what we promised until we have the Presidency ! The excuse was as predictable as summer heat in the Sahara .\nIn January of this year , they formally controlled both houses of Congress and the executive branch . Every single thing they \u2019 d ever promised was now possible .\nThey now had the power to enact every single spending cut they \u2019 d ever solemnly pledged . All those wasteful programs designed to fill the liberal sandbox \u2014 PBS , NPR , Planned Parenthood , NEH and the rest of the alphabet soup ; all the hundreds of billions of dollars in corporate welfare to multi-billion-dollar corporations ; all of the hundreds of billions of dollars directed toward leftist social engineering \u2014 poof ! All of it could come to an end with a stroke of a pen .\nThey now had the power to restore fiscal tax sanity too . Remember the flat tax ? The fair tax ? Slashing the highest corporate taxes in the world ? Giving you a tax break ? All of it could be done with a snap of the fingers .\nRepeal Obamacare ? Check . End illegal immigration ? Check . Build the wall ? Check .\nThere was not a damn thing the Democrats could do to stop them from draining the swamp .\nExcept the Republican leadership didn \u2019 t mean it . With the exception of the Freedom Caucus in the House , and literally a handful in the Senate , the rank-and-file didn \u2019 t either . Not one word of it .\nThe opportunity arose for the vote to repeal Obamacare , and after huffing and puffing , and huffing and puffing some more , the dust settled and socialized health care remains the law of the land , perhaps permanently .\nThe opportunity arose for tax reform , to enact the cuts America desperately needs . It was never a matter of if , it was a matter of how much . It is now mid-August and nothing , absolutely nothing has been accomplished \u2014 even attempted !\nAnd now we face the final test : the debt ceiling . Will we or won \u2019 t we stop the spending madness ? Will the Republicans enact the cuts they \u2019 ve promised , or will they now be the ones to kick the can , piling evermore trillions of dollars of debt on their own grandchildren ?\nBy every indication that \u2019 s precisely what they plan to do . The signal has come from President Trump , from Speaker Ryan , and from Majority Leader McConnell . The debt ceiling will be raised and no fiscal sanity will be restored .\nThere is no difference between Republicans and Democrats . Put them together .
