Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nTanned and rested after a five-week summer vacation, Congress has returned for a brief session before returning home to campaign for re-election. This autumn session is expected to last a couple of weeks, give or take a couple of days.\n\nWhat can be accomplished in so short a time? A great deal, if House and Senate choose to work together. Or nothing, if they don't. If you are wondering which will happen, you haven't been watching the 113th Congress up to now.\n\nCongress has become so predictable in recent months that we can pretty much answer the five questions you probably have about the September session right now, in advance.\n\n1. Will there be another shutdown like last fall?\n\nNo. Both chambers will approve temporary spending measures known as \"continuing resolutions.\" This will keep the federal government running into December, at which time Congress is expected back for a \"lame duck\" session. This is because most Republicans are relatively confident about their party's prospects in the November voting. So why risk another stumble in the polls like the one they suffered with the 2013 partial shutdown?\n\n2. Will Congress give President Obama new authority or fresh funding to battle the terrorist group calling itself Islamic State?\n\nThey might, if he asks. But then again, they might not. So the president may just not ask.\n\nRight now the chances are that he won't ask too directly for anything too specific. Bills were introduced Monday by Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., and Rep.

Why only two weeks of work when there's so much to do?\n\nBecause the two most deadline-sensitive tasks at hand \u2014 the CR and the reauthorizing of the Export-Import Bank \u2014 can be accomplished in short order.\n\nBoth will be driven by the Sept. 30 deadline that would impose real consequences if missed. Both are essentially stopgap measures that, while satisfying no one, will keep the status quo in place through Election Day and probably give the GOP a stronger hand to play in December. The purpose of a pre-election session is not really to tackle the nation's most serious problems. It is, rather, to position incumbents for re-election in November.\n\n4. Is this really the least productive Congress ever?\n\nThere are measures by which this negative distinction can be applied to this Congress. But we should note that the 113th Congress did finish the farm bill left over from the 112th, and it did get immigration reform through one chamber. And while it has not done a budget or a regular process for appropriating money, neither did its predecessor.\n\nAnd it is not fair to call this a \"do nothing\" Congress.
