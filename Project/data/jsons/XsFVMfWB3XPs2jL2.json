    "content": "Approval of Congress is at a new low in 40 years of polling , Americans ' approval of their own representative in Washington is underwater for the first time and a record number of registered voters are inclined to look for someone new in 2014 - all signs of a powerful , palpable public antipathy following the budget spat that shut down much of the government for 16 days .\nAmong other results in the latest \u2588\u2588\u2588/Washington Post poll , a near-record 78 percent of Americans are dissatisfied with the way the federal government works , with downright anger at a new high in polls since 1992 . Criticism over the shutdown is focused on the Republicans , now at their greatest unpopularity in data since 1984 . But the Democrats are damaged too .\nThese and other results indicate severe self-inflicted wounds to Congress as a result of its budget brinksmanship - with Barack Obama , though hardly in stellar shape , largely escaping unscathed . His virtually dead-even job approval rating , 48-49 percent , is essentially the same now as it was a month ago , before the fur - and the furlough notices - flew .\nCompare that to Congress : A mere 12 percent approve of its job performance , while 85 percent disapprove , its worst rating in ABC/Post polls since 1989 and Gallup polls before then dating to 1974 . Seven in 10 disapprove `` strongly '' in this poll , produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates , up 17 percentage points just since July - including 21- and 18-point jumps in strong disapproval in two centrist groups , independents and moderates .\nIt 's long been noted that Americans disapprove of Congress as an institution far more than they disapprove of their own representative . That 's still the case - but less so . Just 43 percent in this survey approve even of their own Congress member , while 47 percent disapprove - record low approval and the first underwater result to this question in ABC/Post polls back 24 years .\nAnother result may deepen the chill for current office-holders : Only 25 percent of registered voters now say they 're inclined to re-elect their representative in Congress ; 66 percent are inclined to look around for someone else - the highest level of anti-incumbency in ABC/Post polls since 1989 .\nThe Republicans may be at particular risk ; just 32 percent of Americans express a favorable view of the party , vs. 63 percent unfavorable - their worst rating , as noted , in at least 29 years . The Democrats , by contrast , manage about an even split in this basic measure of popularity .\nThat said , anti-incumbency is not taking a strong partisan direction . Registered voters split 48-40 percent between the Democrat and the Republican in their House district , unchanged from May and a fairly typical result . It was much better for the Democrats leading into the 2006 midterms and much better for the Republicans leading into 2010 .\nOpen questions include whether this level of anti-incumbency - if it lingers for a full year - gains a more partisan cast , as well as how it plays out not only in the midterm general election , but in the primaries as well . Currently , the inclination to find someone new to support for Congress next year peaks among some groups , but with no clear direction - independents ( 74 percent of whom express anti-incumbent sentiment ) , less-educated whites ( 73 percent ) , political moderates ( 72 percent ) ; those in Mitt-Romney supporting red states ( 72 percent ) and those personally inconvenienced by the partial shutdown ( 72 percent ) .\nDISAFFECTION - One clear element of political attitudes today is the extent of disaffection with government in the shutdown fallout . Notably , for example , the nearly eight in 10 Americans who are dissatisfied with the way the federal government works includes 32 percent who say they 're angry about it .\nThat 's a 21-year record in anger directed at the government , albeit by a single point from its level in November 2011 . The difference is that the previous high came during a period of especially deep economic discontent . Ratings of the economy 's condition , while not at all good , are 14 points better now than they were two years ago - underscoring the more self-inflicted nature of current anger at government .\nNotably , anger at the government is lower among Democrats ( 22 percent ) than it is among Republicans or independents ( 40 and 36 percent , respectively ) , reflecting both the fact that a Democrat runs it , and that his party largely prevailed in the budget dispute . Perhaps not surprisingly , anger at the government peaks , at a remarkable 56 percent , among the one in 10 Americans who describe themselves as strong supporters of the Tea Party political movement .\n\u2022 Seventy-five percent of all Americans are dissatisfied with the way the political system is working . More , 87 percent , call the shutdown a sign of broader problems in the political process , including 42 percent overall who say these problems amount to a crisis .\n\u2022 Eighty-one percent disapprove of the shutdown - 71 percent , `` strongly . '' Anywhere from 80 to 86 percent say it damaged the U.S. economy , the United States ' image in the world and the morale of federal employees . Twenty-two percent were personally inconvenienced , 10 points more than said so in the shutdowns of 1995-96 .\n\u2022 Seventy-two percent are not confident that Obama and the Republicans will avoid another budget crisis when the agreement to end this one runs out this winter .\n\u2022 Sixty-eight percent say the country 's headed seriously off on the wrong track , up 8 points since summer . That 's an unusually negative score in a period of economic growth , however sluggish .\nBLAME - While there 's criticism for all , the Republicans in Congress , and their party , are taking the brunt of the public 's ire . Seventy-seven percent disapprove of the GOP 's handling of the budget dispute , a new high . That rose by 14 points from the start to the end of the shutdown , vs. Obama 's +4 ( to 54 percent disapproval ) and the Democrats ' +5 ( to 61 percent , itself roundly negative ) .\nDisapproval of the GOP 's work on the shutdown advanced most sharply among two groups : It rose by 20 points among Republicans themselves ; 58 percent in this survey disapprove of how their own party 's representatives in Congress handled the issue . And it rose by 24 points , to 79 percent , among a generally more Democratic-oriented group , adults under age 30 .\nMeasured head-to-head , the public blames the Republicans in Congress for the shutdown over Obama by 53-29 percent - similar to the result measuring then-President Bill Clinton vs. the Republicans in January 1996 , after their own shutdown battle . Clinton went on to win re-election the next November , but the Republicans held control of Congress , suggesting it 'd be a mistake to take current blame directed against the GOP as determinative of November 2014 outcomes .\nThat said , the criticism is vast . Americans by 77-20 percent , for example , think the Republicans in Congress are more interested in doing what 's best for themselves politically than what 's best for the country . That compares with an only somewhat-less-awful 63-34 percent for the Democrats in Congress . Again it 's much better for Obama ( if not great ) , 46-52 percent .\nFAVES - The Republicans , as noted , are underwater in overall favorability , 32-63 percent , nearly a precise reversal from their most recent height of popularity 11 years ago . Their favorability rating once was 1 point lower , in late 1998 , but their unfavorable score is 6 points higher than its previous peak in data back to 1984 .\nUnfavorable views of the Republican Party are up 10 points from the last ABC/Post measure in September 2012 , particularly so among very conservatives ( up 21 points ) , college graduates ( 19 points ) , political independents ( 17 points ) and , in a bit of self-flagellation , up 15 points among Republicans themselves .\nIn a related result , 26 percent see the Tea Party favorably , a new low , down from its peak of 41 percent in March 2010 . In another measure , 36 percent describe themselves as Tea Party supporters - another low .\nAt 46-49 percent favorable-unfavorable , the Democratic Party is much less poorly rated than the Republicans - but that 's their own worst rating ( lowest favorable and highest unfavorable alike ) since 1984 , and numerically under water for the first time .\nObama , for his part , is showing much less damage , but is hardly in great shape . His job approval rating , as noted , is 48-49 percent , not much changed from 47-47 percent in September , with `` strong '' disapproval , 39 percent , tying its highest since October 2011 . He 's 50-48 percent on favorability . And the president 's 54 percent disapproval on the economy is its highest in more than a year .\nBUDGET AHEAD - Support for the agreement that ended the shutdown is tepid , with approval at 51-41 percent , likely reflecting the kick-the-can approach and broad skepticism that yet another showdown can be avoided . Indeed , among those who express confidence that Obama and the Republicans can avoid another budget crisis , 61 percent approve of the current agreement ; that falls to 47 percent of those who lack that confidence . In terms of general preferences , Obama leads the GOP by 11 points in trust to find the right balance between cuts and spending - a weak lead , perhaps , given the Republicans ' general unpopularity . However , Americans by a broader 59-37 percent prefer a combination of tax increases and spending cuts , not just spending cuts , in an agreement to trim the deficit .\nThe public by 54-40 percent also prefers no linkage between cutting the deficit and raising the debt limit , again favoring Obama 's position , but again by less of a margin than the GOP 's current unpopularity might imply . That suggests their basic battles - and the fallout - may well continue , to the public 's considerable chagrin .\nMETHODOLOGY - This \u2588\u2588\u2588/Washington Post poll was conducted by telephone Oct. 17-20 , 2013 , in English and Spanish , among a random national sample of 1,002 adults , including landline and cell-phone-only respondents . Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.5 points , including design effect . Partisan divisions are 30-24-40 percent , Democrats-Republicans-independents .\nThe survey was produced for \u2588\u2588\u2588 by Langer Research Associates of New York , N.Y. , with sampling , data collection and tabulation by Abt-SRBI of New York , N.Y .",
