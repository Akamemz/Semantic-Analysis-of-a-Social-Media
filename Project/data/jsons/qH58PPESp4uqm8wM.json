    "content": "Last week , Miriam Pallares boarded a bus in Oklahoma City with her six-year-old daughter and rode through the night to El Paso , Texas for a three-minute hug with family she hadn \u2019 t seen in years .\nThe mother and daughter were among 2,500 people participating in a rare event in which US Customs and Border Protection opens a gate in the fence separating El Paso from Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez , Mexico , allowing families to briefly reunify . Hugs Not Walls , or Abrazos No Muros , was started in the spring of 2016 by non-profit Border Network for Human Rights . It takes place roughly twice a year , when the water flow of the Rio Grande is cut to a trickle . Families on either side of the border wait in line for hours to embrace for three minutes in the dry riverbed .\nFor many , the event marks the first\u2014and last\u2014time they will have physical contact with family members for years .\nBy 7:00 a.m. , hundreds of participants had formed a line that curled around El Paso \u2019 s unassuming Chihuahuita Park . Over blue shirts required for participation , they bundled in coats and blankets , some toting folding chairs and coolers of lunch . Kids ran around the playground , blue shirts reaching their knees . 800 feet away\u2014across train tracks , the soaring border fence and the shallow Rio Grande\u2014corresponding families gathered at an intersection in Ju\u00e1rez , wearing white shirts .\nMiriam , a 27-year-old with bright pink lipstick and an impeccable ponytail , had been anticipating this day ever since she learned about the event on Facebook a couple years ago . \u201c I really want to see my sister\u2014it \u2019 s been four years since I saw her , \u201d she explained in Spanish . \u201c She can \u2019 t come here because she hasn \u2019 t been able to get her visa , and I still haven \u2019 t gotten my asylum . I \u2019 m fighting to get it . \u201d\nAt 8:00 , the line in the park began to move . Some pushed wheelchairs or strollers as they made their way towards a dirt opening next to the border fence . There , participants waited for hours on plastic chairs : Only 20 families could enter through the gate at a time . Miriam was number 82 .\nAs she sat , Miriam exchanged texts and photos with her sister , aunts , and nieces , who waited in Ju\u00e1rez . Her daughter Mairim , a bubbly first grader , danced , collected rocks , and eagerly took our microphone and played reporter , asking about our family members : What are their names ? Where do they live ?\nMiriam and Mairim ( \u201c Miriam \u201d spelled backwards ) left Juarez four years ago after receiving threats from a drug cartel . They settled in Oklahoma City , where Miriam sells burritos and tacos out of a food truck .\nAt 10:30 , when families 81 to 100 were called on a loudspeaker , Miriam and Mairim lined up next to the border fence . Behind them was a woman who , with the exception of last year \u2019 s Hugs Not Walls , hadn \u2019 t seen her 36-year-old son in more than a decade . Ahead of them was mom with blotchy cheeks and teary eyes who hadn \u2019 t seen her own mother in eleven years . Mairim played with other kids in line , reaching small hands through the border fence and trying to spot family on the other side . She couldn \u2019 t recall meeting the relatives in person , but recognized them from years of video calls .\nHugs Not Walls is a logistical jigsaw puzzle , requiring sign-off from CBP , the International Water Commission , local law enforcement , and federal police in Mexico . It \u2019 s also subject to changes in the political climate : Last May , as the number of migrants at the border reached a record high , the event was abruptly cancelled . \u201c Every time we do this , it could be the last one , \u201d explained Fernando Garcia , director of the Border Network for Human Rights . \u201c Having children in cages like that\u2014or in a makeshift detention camp\u2014under a bridge , all of that situation created a very tense relationship with CBP , \u201d he added .\nMario Escalante , a US Border Patrol spokesperson , explained that the agency wasn \u2019 t able to support last May \u2019 s event . Still , Border Patrol maintained a light presence on Saturday , with just a couple of officers on site but with surveillance cameras looking over the event . \u201c For us it \u2019 s business as usual : Maintain border security , \u201d said Escalante . A similar event has been taking place at the border between Tijuana and San Diego since 2013 .\nAfter what felt to Miriam like an eternity of waiting , volunteers led the group down a concrete levy to the river . Mairim held her mother \u2019 s hand as she walked , waving enthusiastically to relatives walking down the levy \u2019 s south side . Miriam captured the moment on Facebook live .\nOne by one , those in blue shirts crossed a narrow , dusty plywood bridge into the dry riverbed on the Mexican side . They were assigned to line up as if starting a race , blue-shirted shoulder to blue-shirted shoulder , waiting for a man with a loudspeaker to tell them to hug . Ten feet away , those with white shirts did the same . Seeing her aunt just steps away , Mairim exclaimed , \u201c T\u00eda ! \u201d and broke into a run before the organizer instructed , \u201c Not yet ! \u201d For a few tense seconds , the families stood looking at each other , separated only by a bit of cracked dirt .\nWhen the organizer yelled , \u201c Hug ! \u201d the wailing was immediate . Families collapsed into each others \u2019 arms . Mairim would later say that she was \u201c so excited to get hugging. \u201d But in the moment , she stood in the middle of a group embrace , weeping . Feet away , other families went through the same routine of hugs , selfies , more hugs , more crying . Cameramen zoomed in on sobbing faces . Along the levy , stoic Mexican police officers looked on . Mairim \u2019 s aunt picked her up and wiped the tears from beneath her niece \u2019 s pink glasses , joking that she had finally made it to Mexico .\nAt 10:53 , the organizer yelled , \u201c Time \u2019 s up ! \u201d and , after final hugs , lines formed again . Blue shirts walked up the levy walkway to El Paso as white shirts walked up the levy to Ju\u00e1rez .
