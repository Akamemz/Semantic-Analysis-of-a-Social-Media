But President-elect Donald Trump \u2019 s pitch for a $ 1 trillion upgrade of the nation \u2019 s roads , bridges , tunnels and airports is already running into potholes as it meets reality in Washington .\nThe overwhelming sticking point , as always , is how to pay for it .\nTrump 's advisers are so far floating the same kinds of financing schemes that Congress has batted around for years with little success , including proposals to lure private investors or reap a revenue windfall through an overhaul of the tax code . Key lawmakers say they \u2019 re in the dark on how Trump \u2019 s plan would work \u2014 with some conservatives simply hoping that his call for massive tax breaks will provide an economic jolt that makes the hard spending decisions easier .\nDemocrats , meanwhile , are split on whether to cooperate with Trump on his plan . Hillary Clinton adviser Ron Klain denounced it Friday as a `` trap '' that would provide `` a massive corporate welfare plan for contractors '' without necessarily spurring any new infrastructure spending .\nEven congressional Republicans who have long championed spending on transportation projects say they don \u2019 t yet know the details of Trump \u2019 s 10-year proposal , which the president-elect has vowed will \u201c put millions of our people to work \u201d while making U.S. infrastructure \u201c second to none . \u201d\n`` Look , we do n't have the details , '' House Transportation Chairman Bill Shuster ( R-Pa. ) told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . `` We 're working very closely with his transition team and hopefully with the new department head to figure out how we 're going to pay for it . It 's got to be fiscally responsible . ''\nA trillion dollars is \u201c a big number , \u201d said Senate Commerce Chairman John Thune ( R-S.D . ) , adding that a tax overhaul could be one promising way to pay for it . \u201c I think it 's going to come down to figuring out just actually what 's achievable . \u201d\n\u201c I think this is critical , something that could draw us together , \u201d said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito ( R-W.Va. ) , who hoped that the infrastructure plan would also include an expansion of broadband internet service . But asked whether a Republican Congress would approve it , she said : \u201c Not if it \u2019 s not paid for . \u201d\n\u201c To just add it to the national debt , I don \u2019 t think President-elect Trump or members of the Republican Conference would support that , \u201d said Rep. Mark Meadows ( R-N.C. ) , a member of the House Transportation Committee and the conservative Freedom Caucus .\nSome Democratic lawmakers were more optimistic than others than any big infrastructure plan will get through Congress , even with a GOP president pushing it .\n`` The country needs it , '' said New York Democratic Rep. Jos\u00e9 Serrano , who sits on the Appropriations Committee . But he said Trump \u201c should be telling us how he \u2019 s going to get it through a Congress that doesn \u2019 t want to spend $ 1.50 on anything . \u201d\nTrump has touted his infrastructure plan as a top priority \u2014 even mentioning it in his election-night victory speech \u2014 raising expectations that it will have a prime place in the agenda for his first 100 days . His senior adviser Steve Bannon has portrayed it as a massive borrow-and-spending binge that would make conservatives `` go crazy , '' telling The Hollywood Reporter : `` With negative interest rates throughout the world , it 's the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything . ... We 're just going to throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks . ''\nBut despite its eye-popping $ 1 trillion price tag , it \u2019 s unclear to infrastructure finance experts whether his plan would involve much , or even any , additional federal spending on top of the five-year , $ 305 billion transportation bill that Congress approved last year .\nTrump advisers walking in and out of Trump Tower in the past week have floated some ideas on how to pay for the plan , which has also seemed to morph day-by-day .\nThe Heritage Foundation 's Stephen Moore , one of Trump 's tax advisers , pitched GOP lawmakers Tuesday on a one-time 10 percent tax on offshore business income , the kind of tax break that Republicans maintain would encourage companies to bring their overseas earnings back to the U.S .\nBut by Wednesday morning , Steven Mnuchin , a leading contender for Treasury secretary , told reporters the transition team was \u201c looking at the creation of an infrastructure bank , \u201d a pot of money that would use federal money to attract state and private dollars to fund projects . It \u2019 s hardly a new idea in transportation circles \u2014 but Trump \u2019 s presidential campaign had blasted Clinton for proposing the same idea , saying such a bank would be \u201c controlled by politicians and bureaucrats in Washington D.C . ''\nPresident Barack Obama has also repeatedly proposed an infrastructure bank , though that idea went nowhere in Congress .\nTrump \u2019 s campaign also called for setting up \u201c public-private partnerships , \u201d another means of encouraging private investors to put their money into infrastructure . In one version , the investors would get tax credits to build a project and could recoup their money by charging fees for its use , such as tolls . But as New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote Saturday , that would be problematic for types of infrastructure that do n't generate revenue streams : `` Toll roads are not the main thing we need right now ; what about sewage systems , making up for deferred maintenance , and so on ? ''\nWhatever the financing mechanism , some Republicans say Trump may be the one to sell it .\n\u201c His business acumen is going to give him a better handle on the fiscal reality than we \u2019 ve had heretofore , \u201d said Rep. Trent Franks ( R-Ariz. ) .\nIn fact , policy experts from both sides of the aisle have faulted Trump \u2019 s broad tax and spending agenda for not even remotely adding up . They say the tax cuts he \u2019 s proposed would add $ 10 trillion to the national debt in the coming decade , while his pledge to trim the debt to zero would require savage cuts to federal spending .\nBut Meadows said he hopes Trump \u2019 s tax cuts would bring a surge in revenue .\n\u201c That stimulus provides an economic boom that will get us back to a 4 , 4.5-percent GDP growth , \u201d he said . \u201c That will actually make some of these questions a lot easier to answer than at an anemic 2.2-to-maybe-2.8 GDP . \u201d\nRep. Lou Barletta ( R-Pa. ) echoed the kind of infrastructure-spending-equals-jobs argument that conservatives rejected when Obama was pushing his $ 832 billion stimulus through a Democratic Congress nearly eight years ago .\n\u201c The federal government will get money back because , as I said , these are good-paying jobs , \u201d Barletta said . \u201c You \u2019 re going to be putting people to work . They \u2019 re going to be paying taxes . That money is going to come back to Washington . \u201d\nBut beyond wide support for the idea of infrastructure spending , Republicans \u2019 unanimity breaks down quickly \u2014 especially when it comes to using repatriated money from corporations ' overseas earnings . House Ways and Means Committee Republicans such as Chairman Kevin Brady of Texas and Dave Reichert of Washington state have indicated they 're lukewarm at best to that idea , saying repatriation revenues should go to lowering tax rates instead .\nThe difference this time , some lawmakers and lobbyists say , is the push infrastructure will be getting from an emboldened President Trump .
