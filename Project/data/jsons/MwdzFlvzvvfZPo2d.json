    "content": "The infamous Trump dossier : Democrats say key parts of it have been proved accurate and Republicans claim it has been debunked .\nBut the truth about the salacious document , written last year by former British spy Christopher Steele , lies somewhere in the middle .\nAn analysis of the 35-page document by \u2588\u2588\u2588 shows that a vast majority of its claims have neither been proved nor disproved . Many are under dispute ; others are the subject of defamation lawsuits .\nDemocrats are correct in one regard . The parts of the dossier that describe in general terms a Russian plot to meddle in the presidential campaign have been backed up by the U.S. intelligence community , which says there is ample evidence that Russia interfered in the presidential campaign . But none of the specific claims about the Trump team \u2019 s involvement have been verified . And some of those specific claims have been vehemently denied by Trump and his associates .\nHere is a review of the dossier \u2019 s claims , in chronological order . Some are quoted directly from the dossier while others are paraphrased .\n\u201c The Russian authorities had been cultivating and supporting US Republican presidential candidate , Donald Trump for at least 5 years . \u201d\nUnsubstantiated . Trump has adamantly denied receiving any help from the Russian government .\n\u201c The Kremlin had been feeding Trump and his team valuable intelligence on his opponents , including Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton , for several years . \u201d\nUnsubstantiated . The Trump campaign has denied receiving help from the Kremlin during the campaign . But the date of this Steele memo \u2014 June 20 \u2014 is significant because it followed 11 days after the now-infamous Trump Tower meeting attended by Donald Trump Jr. , Jared Kushner , campaign chairman Paul Manafort and a group of Russian lobbyists . Trump Jr. accepted the meeting after he was offered damaging information about Clinton . But he claims that no such information was provided .\n\u201c The Kremlin \u2019 s cultivation operation on Trump had also comprised offering him various lucrative real estate development deals in Russia . \u201d\nUnsubstantiated . Trump and his real estate company did discuss real estate projects in Russia , but there has been no evidence produced so far that those were part of a Kremlin \u201c cultivation operation \u201d of Trump .\nRussians sought to \u201c exploit Trump \u2019 s personal obsessions and sexual perversions to obtain suitable \u2018 kompromot \u2019 [ compromising material ] on him. \u201d Kremlin operatives filmed Trump in compromising positions in a Moscow hotel .\nUnsubstantiated . In a press conference just after BuzzFeed published the dossier on Jan. 10 , Trump called the sex allegations \u201c phony stuff . \u201d\n\u201c The Clinton dossier was controlled exclusively by chief Kremlin spokesman , Dmitry Peskov , who was responsible for compiling/handling it on the explicit instructions of Putin himself . \u201d\nUnsubstantiated . While U.S. intelligence officials do believe that Putin was directly involved in the campaign meddling \u2014 a claim that the Kremlin denies \u2014 no evidence has been produced showing that Peskov personally handled the project . Some Russia observers have questioned why Putin \u2019 s chief spokesman would be in charge of the collusion operation .\n\u201c There was a well-developed conspiracy of co-operation between [ the Trump campaign ] and the Russian leadership . \u201d\nUnsubstantiated . Trump and his campaign have adamantly denied the allegation .\n\u201c This was managed on the Trump side by the Republican candidate \u2019 s campaign manager , Paul Manafort , who was using foreign policy advisor , Carter Page , and others as intermediaries . \u201d\nUnsubstantiated . Both Manafort and Page say they do not know each other . Page , who served in a small volunteer role on the campaign , has also never met Trump . He has repeatedly denied the allegations against him in the Steele document , which he calls the \u201c dodgy dossier . \u201d\n\u201c The Russian regime had been behind the recent leak of embarrassing e-mail messages , emanating from the [ DNC ] , to the WikiLeaks platform . \u201d\nTrue . The CIA , FBI , National Security Agency and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence all agree that Russian operatives hacked DNC emails and used WikiLeaks as a cutout to make them public .\n\u201c The operation had been conducted with the full knowledge and support of Trump and senior members of the campaign team . \u201d\nUnsubstantiated . Trump and his campaign have denied the allegation , and no evidence has been released that supports the collusion claim .\n\u201c Russian diplomatic staff in key cities like New York , Washington and Miami were using the emigre \u2018 pension \u2019 distribution system as cover . \u201d\nUnsubstantiated . While this dossier claim has not been proved , it has been reported that U.S. investigators are looking into whether a pension system that the Russian government uses to pay soldiers living abroad was used as cover to finance covert actions during the presidential campaign . What is not known is whether investigators began looking into that independent of the dossier or whether Steele \u2019 s reports prompted the probe .\nIgor Sechin , a crony of Putin \u2019 s and the CEO of Russian oil giant Rosneft , met secretly with Carter Page during a trip that the Trump campaign adviser made to Moscow in early July . Sechin allegedly brought up the possibility of removing Ukraine-related sanctions against Russia , which Page allegedly \u201c reacted positively \u201d to . Page also met secretly with senior Kremlin official Igor Divyekin .\nUnsubstantiated . Page did visit Moscow during the time that the dossier claims . But the visit , where Page gave a speech at the New Economic School , had been revealed in the press by the time Steele made this allegation . Page has denied ever meeting Sechin and Divyekin , though he has spoken positively about the former and said he would be honored to meet him one day .\nPage is suing the parent company of Yahoo ! News for republishing these claims . Yahoo ! reporter Michael Isikoff wrote a Sept. 23 , 2016 article based on the allegations , which he had apparently learned about after meeting with Steele and Fusion GPS , the opposition research firm that hired Steele . ( RELATED : Carter Page Sues Yahoo ! Over Dossier Story )\n\u201c An intelligence exchange had been running between [ the Trump team and Kremlin ] for at least 8 years . \u201d\nUnsubstantiated . No evidence has been produced to support this claim , and the Trump campaign has denied it .\n\u201c Putin \u2019 s priority requirement \u201d in the information exchange with Trump world was to obtain information about Russian oligarchs and their families . Trump and his associates supplied the information .\nUnsubstantiated . Neither the Russian government nor Trumpworld has addressed the claim .\n\u201c The Kremlin had more intel on Clinton and her campaign . \u201d\nTrue . At the time the memo was written , Russian operatives had already hacked into the email account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta . WikiLeaks would begin publishing those hacked emails in October . U.S. intelligence officials have said that there is ample evidence pointing to Russia being behind the hacks .\nCarter Page \u201c conceived and promoted \u201d the idea of releasing hacked DNC emails through WikiLeaks .\nUnsubstantiated . Page has denied allegations in the dossier . Trump and senior members of the campaign have denied that Page offered any significant input to the campaign .\n\u201c The Kremlin had further \u2018 kompromat \u2019 on candidate Clinton and had been considering releasing this via \u2018 plausibly deniable \u2019 channels after the Duma ( legislative ) elections were out of the way in mid-September . \u201d\nTrue . WikiLeaks would begin releasing Podesta emails a month after Steele wrote this claim in the dossier .\nRussian diplomat Mikhail Kalugin was withdrawn from Washington at short notice because of his \u201c heavy involvement in the US presidential election operation. \u201d Kalugin took part in the veterans \u2019 pension \u201c ruse \u201d to help fund the active measures campaign .\nPartially True . Kalugin was called back from Washington , D.C. at the time that the dossier claims he was . But he denied to McClatchy that he was involved in paying any operatives to influence the election . McClatchy also reported that the FBI was investigating whether Russia \u2019 s intelligence agency , the FSB , used a pension system for former Russian soldiers to disguise payments for hackers who targeted the campaign . The status of that investigation is unclear .\nTrump participated in sex parties in St. Petersburg and paid bribes to make the stories \u201c disappear. \u201d Azerbaijani-Russian billionaire Aras Agalarov would know the details .\nUnsubstantiated . Trump does know Agalarov . They partnered on a deal to host the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Russia . The Agalarov family was also involved in the June 9 , 2016 Trump Tower meeting . It was set up at the request of Agalarov \u2019 s son , Emin .\n\u201c Clandestine meeting between\u2026Trump \u2019 s lawyer Michael Cohen and Kremlin representatives in August 2016. \u201d The meeting took place in Prague .\nFalse . Cohen has vehemently denied the allegations that he met with Kremlin representatives to discuss collusion and that he traveled to Prague .
