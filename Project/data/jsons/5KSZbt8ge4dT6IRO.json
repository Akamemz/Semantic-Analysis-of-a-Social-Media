Yehyun Kim/USA Today via Reuters\nThomas Homan , the Trump administration \u2019 s acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement from January 2017 to June 2018 , helped to transform the agency into an arm of Donald Trump \u2019 s nativist agenda . During his 17 months , ICE escalated its terror tactics against immigrant communities , tormented thousands of individuals in ICE custody , and lied to federal courts . On Thursday , asked to answer for his agency \u2019 s conduct and policies in a congressional hearing , he responded with a meltdown that perfectly captured a lawless organization \u2019 s rejection of any rules or authority that might limit its power .\nThursday \u2019 s hearing before the House Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship focused on ICE detention centers , a hotbed of human rights abuses . More than 50,000 immigrants are currently being held in ICE custody , with private , for-profit prisons housing nearly three-fourths of them . Reports issued by the Department of Homeland Security \u2019 s Office of Inspector General in June 2019 and September 2018 found that ICE facilities are filthy , brutal , and dangerous . Immigrants , including children , are routinely denied access to medical care .
