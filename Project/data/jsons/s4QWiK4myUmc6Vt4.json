    "content": "We live in perplexing times when the U.S. president saw \u201c very fine people \u201d among neo-Nazis who marched in Charlottesville , Virginia , and we have a television network that traffics in racism and conspiracy theories . Our world is being described in fraudulent ways , and history is being rewritten to suit these distorted narratives . The last thing we need , and the last thing I \u2019 d expect to happen , is for an intellectual honor as paramount as the Nobel Prize to go to a writer who embodies the prime intellectual diseases of our era . And let \u2019 s remember that the Nobel selection comes at a moment when violent white supremacists are singling out the 1990s Serbs as heroic avatars of what needs to be done in our world . It \u2019 s dumbfounding that the Nobel Committee would seize this moment to honor an Austrian writer who defends these war criminals and dissembles on their behalf .\nStockholm is more than 1,500 miles from Sarajevo , and the war in Bosnia was halted in 1995 , so there \u2019 s a lot of time and distance between the Swedes who just chose the winner of the Nobel Prize in literature and the nasty war that happened in the heart of the Balkans a generation ago . But that \u2019 s no excuse for the decision to give this year \u2019 s prize to Peter Handke , who denies that a well-documented genocide was committed by Serbs against Muslims in Bosnia .\nI honestly don \u2019 t know where to begin with this whole thing . But let me start by making clear what I am not saying . I am not saying that we should not read Handke \u2019 s literary work . My objection is not a version of the age-old question of whether we should listen to Richard Wagner . Go ahead and listen to Wagner . Go ahead and read Handke . My point is this : It is one thing to read him \u2014 it is quite another to bestow upon him a prize that delivers a great amount of legitimacy to his entire body of work , not just the novels and plays that are most impeccable and nonpolitical .\nHandke \u2019 s most famous political offense was attending the funeral of Serbian strongman Slobodan Milo\u0161evic , who died in prison awaiting a trial for genocide and war crimes . Handke had visited Milo\u0161evic during his detention in The Hague and made a short eulogy during his funeral in Po\u017earevac , Serbia , in 2006 . This followed many years of Handke writing about how the Serbs were misunderstood and were unfairly given the lion \u2019 s share of blame for the bloodshed that occurred during the breakup of the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s .\nThe controversy over Handke winning the Nobel Prize revolves around what he wrote in a series of essays in 1996 that were collected in a short book titled , \u201c A Journey to the Rivers : Justice for Serbia. \u201d His book , based on a brief trip he made to Serbia , complained that the media \u201c relentlessly portray the Serbs as evil , \u201d and Handke pretended to distance himself from the Serbian leader , writing that \u201c I am with the Serbian people , not with Milo\u0161evic \u201d \u2014 which turned out to be a strange thing for one of the few Westerners who attended Milo\u0161evic \u2019 s funeral to have written .\nSo what does Handke really believe , and is it so terrible ? Handke distilled his views into a concise article he wrote for the French newspaper Liberation after his 1996 essays appeared . The article has gotten very little attention in the current discussion , and that \u2019 s unfortunate because it clearly demonstrates that he is a truther on the subject of the genocide in Bosnia . For instance , he wrote that it is wrong to talk of \u201c concentration camps \u201d in Bosnia .\n\u201c True , there were intolerable camps between 1992 and 1995 on the territories of the Yugoslav republics , especially in Bosnia , \u201d he wrote . \u201c But let \u2019 s stop automatically connecting these camps to the Serbs in Bosnia . There were also Croat camps and Muslim camps , and the crimes committed here and there are and will be judged at the Hague . \u201d\nLet me tell you something about the Serb camps in Bosnia that Handke , who never visited Bosnia during the war , does not admit : They were concentration camps . I visited them during the war , which I covered for the Washington Post . I talked with prisoners inside the camps , as well as survivors . The United Nations war crimes tribunal at The Hague sentenced Serbs to lengthy prison terms for the crimes committed there .\nLet me tell you something else about Bosnia : The Muslims had nothing like those industrial-scale camps , where thousands of prisoners were brought in , tortured , and killed . The position that Handke adopts \u2014 everyone was doing it \u2014 is a dodge that would be funny if it weren \u2019 t so evil . Were some atrocities committed by Muslim troops ? Yes , but equating a small number of random crimes with a systemic and massive number is a transparent form of deception and deflection . That \u2019 s what apologists do .\nHandke , who lives in France , deepens that deception in his article for Liberation . When writing about Srebrenica , where several thousand Muslims were executed by Serb forces after they captured the enclave , he allows that what happened there was the most \u201c abominable \u201d massacre in the war , but he swiftly pivots to saying that we should also \u201c listen to the survivors of Muslim massacres in numerous Serb villages around Srebrencia. \u201d This is the same \u201c all sides do it \u201d canard , which equates the extremely few with the very many , and fails to acknowledge that this war was started by Serbs and Milo\u0161evic in particular .\nHandke is full of it . The writer David Rieff , who has reported from Bosnia , took the time to read \u201c A Journey to the Rivers \u201d and issued this assessment of its author : \u201c The truth is that he doesn \u2019 t know what he \u2019 s talking about . \u2026 He came to Serbia knowing nothing about its complicated politics and , to judge by the book , left knowing no more . \u201d",
