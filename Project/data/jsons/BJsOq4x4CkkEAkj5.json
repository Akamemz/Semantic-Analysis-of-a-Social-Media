It \u2019 s just what it sounds like . A budget lays out all federal expenditures for the coming fiscal year . The entire government spent a total of about $ 3.6 trillion in fiscal 2015 .\nThat includes every dollar spent on entitlement programs such as Medicare , Medicaid and Social Security ( which account for close to 70 percent federal spending ) .\nIt also includes the remaining part for running military programs or the Department of Interior . Congress refers to the former section of spending as \u201c mandatory \u201d because lawmakers don \u2019 t adjudicate how that money is spent .\nIt just flows out the door based on what entitlement benefits people are owed . Congress doesn \u2019 t annually dedicate funds for entitlements . Members of Congress refer to the second section of spending as \u201c discretionary . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s because lawmakers have \u201c discretion \u201d over how to spend that money . Congress decides to send X dollars to the Pentagon and Y dollars to the Department of Interior and so-on .\nJust before he left office , then-House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio , cut a deal with the president to avoid an immediate government shutdown .\nThe plan would also raise the debt ceiling and establish a \u201c discretionary \u201d spending figure of about $ 1.07 trillion . Congress can then divide the total discretionary figure into 12 unequal parts ( representing each of the 12 appropriations bills ) to fund each section of government .\nHowever , Congress must first adopt an annual budget to dictate the total spending figure for mandatory and discretionary spending . Failing to do so provides House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers , R-Ky. , scant guidance as to the size of his spending pie .\nIt paralyzes the appropriations process right there -- to say nothing of the quandary facing Republicans who want to restore \u201c regular order . \u201d\nHowever , a parliamentary work-around exists for not passing a budget .\nThe House and Senate can always just \u201c deem \u201d that it approved a \u201c budget \u201d in order to start cranking through appropriations .\n\u201c Deeming \u201d is a make-believe way for Congress to say it did something -- even if it really didn \u2019 t . Such an ad hoc-tool usually involves language latched to another legislative measure so Congress doesn \u2019 t have to deal with the underlying issue at hand .\nBut importantly , deeming falls short of approving an actual budget resolution . Deeming only dictates a discretionary spending number .\nAppropriators then know the size of their pie and can slice it to comprise the 12 spending bills . Plus , deeming robs lawmakers of any opportunity to use the special budget reconciliation gambit to navigate tricky Senate waters .\nDeeming resolutions are not unheard of . The House or Senate have initiated nine deeming resolutions in recent years . A provision in the Boehner-Obama pact also stipulates that the Senate can adopt a deeming resolution between April 15 and May 15 to establish appropriations spending levels .\nYou think Freedom Caucus members are upset at the way Boehner ran the show ? Imagine the acrimony if the House \u201c deems \u201d the spending number for this appropriations cycle .\nBut if things go south on a budget , deeming may be the only option available if House Republicans want to approve standalone appropriations bills and not face an omnibus spending bill or CR later .\nNow , let \u2019 s evaluate the political roadblocks to passing a budget .\nHouse Freedom Caucus members are balking at approving a budget that complies with the Boehner-Obama deal and triggers an appropriations spending level of approximately $ 1.07 trillion for fiscal 2017 ( which starts October 1 ) .\nConservatives can \u2019 t score cuts from the mandatory side of the spending ledger . But they can chop into the discretionary side . Members of the Freedom Caucus are pushing for a discretionary figure ranging between $ 20 to $ 70 trillion below the Boehner/Obama floor .\nMany Freedom Caucus members say their constituents demand additional spending cuts . Moreover , they don \u2019 t think that Ryan should have to adhere to the deal forged by the former speaker\nNever mind the argument that both bodies of Congress approved the Boehner-Obama legislation . Therefore , sticking to the $ 1.07 trillion discretionary spending number would be following \u201c regular order . \u201d\nThe House Freedom Caucus commands 40-plus votes in the 246-member House Republican Conference . Attrition among that group could imperil the GOP \u2019 s efforts to approve a budget .
