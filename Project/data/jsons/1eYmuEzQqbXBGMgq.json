Of those cases, 15 were fatal.\n\nWhy this case is different\n\nAnalysis by Jessica Lussenhop, BBC News\n\nThe swiftness with which a white police officer was fired in the killing of Rayshard Brooks is just the latest sign of how rapidly and dramatically police agencies have shifted strategy when it comes to dealing with deadly force cases.\n\nHistorically, not only have police chiefs been reticent to fire officers involved in in-custody deaths until a \"full investigation\" had taken place, they've been quick to defend the officer's use of force if he or she \"reasonably\" believed that a person had a deadly weapon or posed immediate danger to the officer.\n\nIn this case, video shows that Brooks had taken the officer's Taser and appears to use it. But not only is the weapon non-lethal, the video shows he was running away and that the shots that killed him entered his back.\n\nIf the officer is criminally charged in this case, the question of whether or not a Taser should be considered a deadly weapon will surely come into play, as well as whether the officer had \"reasonable\" fear of Brooks.\n\nBut at this stage, what is already clear is that police departments are not feeling nearly as confident relying on the old strategies and rhetoric that historically have allowed them to slow-play their response to a police-involved killing.\n\nWhat are lawmakers doing?\n\nLast week, House Democrats introduced sweeping legislation, demanding federal police use body and dashboard cameras, banning the use of chokeholds, eliminating unannounced police raids known as \"no-knock warrants\" and making it easier to prosecute police for misbehaviour.\n\nThe Justice in Police Act of 2020 also calls for the end of \"qualified immunity\" - designed to give police legal breathing room surrounding their decisions on the job and frequently used to dismiss excessive force cases against officers.\n\nOn Sunday, Republican Senator Tim Scott described this element of the Democrat's bill as a \"poison pill\" for Republicans, making the measure impossible to pass.\n\nMr Scott, the lone African-American Republican senator, is spearheading his own party's legislative efforts to address police reform.\n\nHis own proposal includes a system for local police departments to better report cases in which officers' actions result in injury and death, and improved officer training.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is also expected to sign an executive order on police reform on Tuesday, establishing national standards for use of force.\n\nMeanwhile, police forces across the country are introducing reforms - several have banned the use of chokeholds unless there is a threat to life.",
