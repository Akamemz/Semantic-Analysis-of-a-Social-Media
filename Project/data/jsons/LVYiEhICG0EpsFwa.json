    "content": "More than 30 Amazon workers at a Sacramento warehouse walked off the job this morning , demanding they receive paid time off .\nAround 2:45 am on Monday local time , 36 workers \u2014 out of around 100 in total on the shift\u2014 left work two hours early after they read a letter to management out loud stating their demands to be granted paid time off ( PTO ) and meet with management to discuss their concerns , according to a worker at the site .\nThese workers \u2014 who say they lift hundreds of packages a day in \u201c back-breaking \u201d labor \u2014currently receive zero PTO days a year . The walkout comes weeks after workers say management has ignored their requests to meet with leaders of a group organizing around the issue . So far , workers have circulated an internal and public petition gaining over 4,000 signatures in total . The actions have been organized by a group of workers on site called Amazonians United Sacramento , which led a successful campaign in the past to get multiple colleagues reinstated who were fired for missing work , in one case while the colleague was suffering the loss of a family member .\nThe recent walkout is also an escalation of labor tension at Amazon \u2019 s growing network of last-mile delivery centers , which are smaller warehouses where workers prepare packages that are then sent out to customers \u2019 doorsteps . Most workers at the Sacramento site \u2014 as with those at other delivery stations across the US \u2014 are prohibited from working more than 30 hours a week . They often work up to that maximum amount allotted and sometimes more than that during peak shopping times . Workers say their shifts are physically grueling , involving lifting boxes of up to 50 pounds at a rapid pace , especially right before the holidays when they see their workload increase .\nBut because they aren \u2019 t working full-time hours , most of these workers do not receive benefits such as employer-subsidized health insurance , and they can be fired for taking off more than 20 hours every quarter . Amazon publicly promises its part-time employees paid time off on its own website ( notably , though , the policy differs for California employees ) , as well as in its employee handbook , according to documents Recode reviewed .\nWhen workers in Sacramento pointed this out to management , they say they were told the rules don \u2019 t apply to them since they are a specific subcategory of \u201c class q \u201d and \u201c class m \u201d logistics workers \u2014 a distinction they had previously never heard of and were given no explanation for .\n\u201c The fact is that Amazon is a trillion dollar company run by the richest man in the world , \u201d the Sacramento workers said in the public petition , \u201c and they intentionally give all class q part-time workers less benefits than regular part-time workers so that they grow the company at our expense .
