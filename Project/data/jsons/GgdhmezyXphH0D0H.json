    "content": "The sharp increase in popularity of social media networks ( primarily Facebook ) has created a predatory secondary market among online publishers seeking to profitably exploit the large reach of those networks and their huge customer bases by spreading fake news and outlandish rumors . Competition for social media \u2019 s large supply of willing eyeballs is fierce , and a number of frequent offenders regularly fabricate salacious and attention-grabbing tales simply to drive traffic ( and revenue ) to their sites .\nFacebook has worked at limiting the reach of hoax-purveying sites in their customers \u2019 news feeds , inhibiting ( but not eradicating ) the spread of fake news stories . Hoaxes and fake news are often little more than annoyances to unsuspecting readers ; but sometimes circulating stories negatively affect businesses or localities by spreading false , disruptive claims that are widely believed .\nSo long as social media allows for the rapid spread of information , manipulative entities will seek to cash in on the rapid spread of misinformation . Perhaps the most egregious of the many nonsense peddlers on social media are fake news sites , so here we offer a guide to several of the most frequent ( and unapologetic ) hoax purveyors cluttering up newsfeeds everywhere .\nNo list of shameless misinformation would be complete without a mention of National Report ( and its omnipresent former lead writer , Paul Horner ) , as the site is ( or was ) perhaps the most prominent example of its genre .\nAmong National Report \u2018 s most widespread hoaxes were claims that notorious street artist Banksy was arrested and unmasked ( as Paul Horner , naturally ) , that a teen was imprisoned over a \u201c swatting prank , \u201d and that a U.S. company was hiring mercenaries to kill ISIS militants . While most of the site \u2019 s efforts have been relatively benign , their fake story about an Ebola outbreak \u2019 s prompting a quarantine in Purdon , Texas , caused headaches for local officials at the height of coverage and anxiety about the virus .\nNational Report ( and its \u201c satirical \u201d brethren ) have sustained huge losses of traffic in the wake of Facebook \u2019 s algorithm changes intended to limit the reach of fake news . In response , sites have been established that spoof the domain names of legitimate news outlets such as the Washington Post and USA Today which mirror the National Report \u2018 s content in order to more efficiently dupe readers and work around Facebook \u2019 s restrictions .\n( The ubiquitous Paul Horner has since moved on to the equally fake News Examiner site , continuing to offer fictitious stories about subjects such as the world \u2019 s first successful head transplant . )\nStraddling the line of fake news and the occasional seed of truth is World News Daily Report . By cobbling together misattributed stolen photographs ( and often using extant , long-circulating rumors ) , World News Daily Report has published several viral claims often preying upon readers \u2019 religious beliefs , including hoaxes about a newly-discovered eyewitness account of Jesus \u2019 miracles , an ancient rumor about chariot wheels found at the bottom of the Red Sea , and a very old yarn about the discovery of giant skeletons reworked as the tale of a coverup perpetrated by the Smithsonian Institution . However , World News Daily Report frequently branches out to science-based fakery , including japes about the destruction of the world \u2019 s oldest tree and another about the discovery of a Megalodon shark in Pakistan .\nPolitical conspiracy is another favored topic of World News Daily Report , evidenced by articles claiming that a CIA agent confessed to killing Marilyn Monroe and that Yoko Ono disclosed she once had an intimate partnering with Hillary Clinton .\nWhile National Report and World News Daily Report often take advantage of politically , socially , or religiously divisive issues to drive outrage-based traffic , Huzlers employs a markedly different approach to fake news hoaxes , often invoking the names of popular brands and restaurants in its quest to snare readers with gross-out stories .\nAmong Huzlers \u2019 most prominent yarns : Chipotle was caught using cat and dog meat in their dishes , Starbucks was discovered to be using semen in their beverages , Arizona iced tea tested positive for urine , and McDonald \u2019 s was outed for including human meat in their products .\nLike its fellows , Huzlers tailors its scope to leverage topical news trends . A popular claim made by the site ( at the apex of an Ebola outbreak ) involved zombies , and another alleged that a man had traded his toddler to buy an Apple Watch .\nEmpire News ( spun off from what was initially a sports-related fake news site ) is another outlet responsible for the propagation of fabricated claims that spread on sites like Facebook . Some of their stories are apolitical and simply compelling to readers , such as a claim the Netflix entertainment streaming service would be shuttering due to the negative impact of piracy , or one that Las Vegas planned to legalize dog fighting to boost casino revenues .\nOther Empire News hoaxes were somewhat news-based , such as one predicting massive national snowfalls for the winter of 2014-2015 . Some articles targeted political or social controversies , such as one claiming a protestor in in Ferguson , Missouri , had accidentally burned down his own house . Separate rumors included one holding that Facebook was spying on gun owners for Homeland Security and one claiming that food stamp recipients would be awarded free cars ( or that the food stamp program would be discontinued entirely ) .\nWhen Empire News created a rumor about a WalMart shoplifter reportedly caught with $ 100 worth of groceries stashed in her vagina , the claim was spread not only by social media users but also by other sites of dubious credibility ( such as Huzlers and Daily Viral Stuff ) .\nFake news sites often play to users \u2019 existing beliefs to spread their claims , but Stuppid ( a site that truly lives up to its name ) is less focused in its contribution to the avalanche of fakery on the Internet . Efforts by Stuppid largely encompass morally offensive fabrications , such as a claim parents admitted to having sex in front of their kids to teach them about procreation , another about a Florida man marrying a baby , and a salacious tale of an incestuous mother-daughter relationship .\nStuppid frequently swipes publicly-available photographs such as mugshots and deliberately misattributes them , as they did in a story about two Floridians allegedly arrested for selling golden tickets to Heaven . Another such story involved a death row inmate \u2019 s purported request for a last meal of kittens illustrated with a photograph of deceased serial killer Dorothea Puente .\nPaul Horner , the prolifically puerile online troll and ubiquitous fake news character ( he inserts his name into all his articles ) whose work previously appeared on the National Report fake news site , has since started the News Examiner . The News Examiner skirts Facebook \u2019 s crackdown on fake news sites by mixing real news and listicle items in with its fake news reports , but the site neither identifies its fake news items as \u201c satire \u201d nor carries a disclaimer to that effect .\nFake stories from the News Examiner that have circulated widely enough as real news to prompt numerous inquiries from our readers include articles about the world \u2019 s first successful head transplant and President Obama \u2019 s limiting churches to offering twice-monthly services .\nNewswatch28 is a relative newcomer to the fake news world , bursting onto the scene in late April 2015 with a site that simulates a TV news web site and likewise skirts Facebook \u2019 s crackdown on fake news by mixing real news articles in with its completely made-up stories .\nThe site \u2019 s \u201c Quest \u201d page unhelpfully informs readers that Newswatch28 presents \u201c Shocking news and stories , celebrity news and gossip . Whether currently occurring , interesting , controversial , abnormal , thought provoking or satirical , we only wish to inform and entertain with the content we publish . \u201d\nFake stories from the Newswatch28 that have circulated widely enough as real news to prompt numerous inquiries from our readers include articles about a 76-year-old woman expelled from a KFC for breastfeeding her 42-year-old son , the FDA \u2019 s approving the sale of tranquilizer guns for use on children , and an Al Pacino death hoax .\nIn later incarnations , the hoax-purveyor became Newswatch33 ; among its newer pieces were items claiming that suspected Charleston shooter Dylann Roof raised $ 4 million in donations , that a study was paying subjects an exorbitant sum of money to smoke pot , that a man killed himself over black actors in Star Wars , and an iteration of the popular fake news claim that NASA confirmed a 15-day period of total darkness .\nThe Naha Daily appears to be defunct , but during that site \u2019 s brief lifespan from September 2014 to January 2015 it published several fake news pieces that continue to pop up regularly on social media and web sites \u2014 most notably an article claiming that fashion CEO Michael Kors said he is tired of \u201c pretending to like blacks . \u201d\nThat item gained enough traction to prompt calls that Michael Kors be boycotted over his fictitious racist remarks :\n# BOYCOTTMK Michael Kors CEO stated \u201c I \u2019 m tired of pretending I like blacks \u201d MK said \u201c he doesn \u2019 t want his purses filled with synthetic hair \u201d \u2014 Cheryl Nidoy ( @ TLV_Cher ) January 7 , 2015\nNaha Daily also made the pages of \u2588\u2588\u2588.com with fake news pieces about Jaden Smith \u2018 s plans to have his penis removed on his 18th birthday , Michael Jordan \u2018 s indifference to kids dying over his sneakers , and Oprah Winfrey \u2018 s accusing Bill Cosby of raping her .\nThe Stately Harold shouldn \u2019 t be fooling anyone , given the deliberate misspelling in its name , a front page filled with articles by \u201c feminist Cassidy Boon \u201d about such hard-hitting topics as \u201c Redefining beauty : Why cankles are hot ! \u201d and an introduction from the Chief Editor that states \u201c Hi ! My nme is Clive Pebble . I have Dyslexia but my drem evre sens I was a litl boy has ben to strat a newspapr . Nwo I have ! ! \u201d\nNonetheless , now that social media users often never visit a site \u2019 s main page , the Stately Harold has since its November 2014 start managed to fool readers with fake news articles about Hillary Clinton \u2019 s wanting to ban beards , President Obama \u2019 s referring to Baltimore rioters as \u201c black heroes , \u201d a 9-year-old boy \u2019 s being suspended from school for saying that he \u201c didn \u2019 t like Obama , \u201d and President Obama \u2019 s pardoning Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev .\nThe Stately Harold unhelpfully identifies itself as a \u201c satire \u201d site in a manner that is deliberately difficult for readers to find , requiring them to highlight the solid black background of a page footer to disclose the site \u2019 s \u201c satire \u201d tag :\nNewsBuzzDaily is pretty low-rent for a fake news site : it doesn \u2019 t display a logo or masthead on its pages , and it mainly traffics in lame , made-up , exclamation point-driven celebrity gossip items ( e.g. , \u201c Lebron James Admits To Hair Transplant ! ! \u201d and \u201c Woman \u2019 s Lips Explode After Doing Kylie Jenner Challenge ! ! \u201d ) along with that lowest form of fake news , celebrity death hoaxes .\nNonetheless , the site has scored a few social media hits with puerile articles about Wendy \u2019 s restaurants using rat and horse meat to make their chili , and the Fox Network \u2019 s cancelling the popular TV series Empire after only a single season .\nNewsBuzzDaily at least scores some points for carrying a ( somewhat less than clear ) disclaimer on all their pages advising readers that the site is \u201c a combination of real shocking news and satire news \u201d and that \u201c articles written on this site are for entertainment and satirical purposes only . \u201d\nNow8News burst onto the fake news scene in mid-2015 , racking up an impressive number of successful social media hoaxes despite the barely plausible premise upon which most were based : a man was arrested for having sex with a pig at Walmart , an obese woman was arrested for starving her kids so she could eat their food , a woman was arrested for \u201c trying on \u201d tampons in an aisle at Walmart , a separate woman was arrested for using a sausage to sexually gratify herself ( also at Walmart ) , a man was found cannibalizing a teen in a Texas haunted house attraction , KFC was busted breeding mutant chickens , and McDonald \u2019 s closed 17,000 locations because the minimum wage was raised .\nThe site was also responsible for rumors that an old lady was arrested making cat fur coats , a man fed his cheating fiancee \u2019 s remains to her parents , President Obama lowered the age of consent to 13 , a lottery winner died after gold-plating his testicles , a couple was busted running a meth lab in the \u201c attic \u201d of a Walmart , hair elastics presented a grave health threat because they were manufactured from used condoms , a sitter discovered a \u201c clown doll \u201d was actually a tiny rapist , a tube of cookie dough \u201c exploded \u201d inside a female shoplifter \u2019 s body cavity , and finally , that a woman caused a riot after experiencing gastric distress during a round of \u201c vodka butt shots . \u201d\nMan Kills His Date After She , Inspired By Twitter # WasteHisTime2016 Trend , Wasted His Time : https : //t.co/iS1KhkSZXu pic.twitter.com/1IJMa3dWob \u2014 The Reporterz ( @ TheReporterz ) January 8 , 2016\nA fairly new entrant to the fake news round-up in early 2016 , The Reporterz started a popular hoax claim that a man killed a woman over her behavior following the # WasteHisTime Twitter trend . In addition , the site started a rumor that the state of Delaware was introducing a \u201c child support card \u201d that limited what mothers can and can not buy with their stipends .\nAnother 2016 contender on the fake news scene was Empire Herald , which among other wild fabrications reported that a meth-addled couple ate a homeless man in Central Park . Created on 24 January 2016 , the site managed to spread several ( often recycled ) fake news claims in the span of a few short weeks .\nThe name Satira Tribune clued many readers in to this web site \u2019 s intent , and its tagline ( \u201c satirical news for satirical folks \u201d ) certainly drove the point home to those who scrolled down to the bottom of the page . But that didn \u2019 t stop the site \u2019 s claims ( that MMA fighter Ronda Rousey fought off several muggers , that Jimmy Carter said medical marijuana cured his cancer , that the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) fined Bill Maher for smoking a joint on Real Time , or that Donald Trump paid Sarah Palin $ 10 million for endorsing him ) from spreading on social media .\nNC Scooper ( or Nevada County Scooper ) was one of the few ostensibly humor-based fake news sites whose items floated around social media . Most articles published by NC Scooper were clearly satirical in nature and not intended to deceive readers by spreading false information ; nevertheless , a few efforts genuinely confused social media users . Among NC Scooper \u2018 s crossover bits were pieces claiming official \u201c gun confiscation units \u201d were taking people \u2019 s weapons , that Merle Haggard left his estate to an LBGT group , that Meg White of the White Stripes was joining Rush , and that Sen. Bernie Sanders called for \u201c chemtrail reform . \u201d\nAssociated Media Coverage was yet another fresh face on the fake news scene in early 2016 . After its February 2016 creation , Associated Media Coverage swiftly leapt into the hoaxmongering business with bits about a motorcycle curfew , an e-juice ban , a two-pet maximum ordinance , and a fabricated claim that a transgender woman was shot in a Colorado department store bathroom .\nAssociated Media Coverage also has apparently spawned sites that appear to be legitimate local news bearing shocking ( but fake ) stories : Boston Tribune , Boston Leader , Baltimore Gazette , and Seattle Tribune are four that we have been able to identity so far .\nReact365 isn \u2019 t a fake news site per se , but rather a generator for user-created hoax articles . Although the site \u2019 s stated purpose involved \u201c prank [ ing ] your friends , \u201d articles about mandatory babysitting by grandparents and great white sharks in the Mississippi River escaped into the social media wild .\nLike Nevada County Scooper , the Burrard Street Journal appeared to be largely comedic in nature and not an intentional purveyor of hoaxes . Although most social media users seemed to recognize the site \u2019 s purpose , Burrard Street Journal items were occasionally mistaken for real news . Those included claims Donald Trump opined America ought not to have \u201c given Canada its independence , \u201d President Trump declared Canadian women the States \u2019 largest threat after ISIS , and President Obama asserted he refused to leave office were Donald Trump elected .\nAlthough The Last Line of Defense ( The Resistance ) carries a disclaimer , it is frequently mistaken for legitimate news about a bevy of topical controversies . Items published by this site which have duped social media users included claims the Obama girls were arrested in Hawaii , that George Soros was arrested for \u201c hate crimes against America , \u201d and President Trump \u201c billed \u201d former First Lady Michelle Obama for several billion dollars .\nLike The Last Line of Defense ( The Resistance ) , As American As Apple Pie and Freedum Junkshun carry clear disclaimers warning readers they are fake news sites :\nWhen no one can trust the lying fake news liberal media anymore because they hate us and guns and Harley Davidson and meat and OUR president , As American as Apple Pie is here to be your beacon of something you can kinda rely on sometimes , but not really . God Bless America and Amen . We believe that there is nothing more precious than the mind of an aging conservative . Here we gather a boatload of bullhonkey , works of pure satirical fiction , to give the fist-shakers of the world a reason to hate . Reality is often in the eye of the beholder . You won \u2019 t find any of it here . Join the fun in the comments on our Facebook page where you too can watch David Hasselhoff running over someone \u2019 s poodle magically transformed into a crime against humanity by Barack Obama or yet another murder the Clintons got away with .\nNevertheless , their material is regularly shared as \u201c real news. \u201d Items from As American As Apple Pie mistaken for legitimate news included claims Alec Baldwin was arrested for threatening President Trump and a Muslim mayor \u201c outlawed Christmas \u201d within city limits . And like Last Line of Defense , As American As Apple Pie and Freedum Junkshun leverage topical controversies to accumulate social media shares using \u201c outrage bait , \u201d as did the latter with a phony story about a flight crew \u201c taking a knee \u201d rather than transporting New Orleans Saints players who engaged in the referenced protest . A 27 October 2017 post to Last Line of Defense \u2018 s Facebook page confirmed Freedum Junkshun is another of its operations .\nLike React365 , BreakingNews365.net and BreakingNews247.net are not fake news sites . Another series of prank generators , they enable anyone to create any headline and description complete with fabricated shares :\nLike Now8News , Action News 3 ( ActionNews3.com ) advances topical fake news items under the guise of a small local news affiliate . Specializing in death hoaxes ( phony news items about Morgan Freeman , Bob Barker , and George Zimmerman went viral ) , the site also leverages social media fads like \u201c creepy clowns \u201d to spread its falsehoods .\nMuch like abcnews.com.co , this site generates traffic by passing itself off as the actual website for ABC News . As we noted in December 2017 , the site \u2019 s front page , featuring a story about former Today Show host Matt Lauer , was designed to mimic that of ABC News :\nBeyond imitating ABC \u2019 s page design , we found that abcnews-us.com also copied their actual reporting .\nWhile the myriad sites referenced here represent only a small sample of the overall \u201c satire \u201d nuisance on social media , many widely-dispersed fake news claims have originated with them . All of the sites mentioned above exist solely to spread false information , and none can be trusted as legitimate sources , no matter how compelling their claims might be .",

However, World News Daily Report frequently branches out to science-based fakery, including japes about the destruction of the world\u2019s oldest tree and another about the discovery of a Megalodon shark in Pakistan.\n\nPolitical conspiracy is another favored topic of World News Daily Report, evidenced by articles claiming that a CIA agent confessed to killing Marilyn Monroe and that Yoko Ono disclosed she once had an intimate partnering with Hillary Clinton.\n\nHuzlers\n\nWhile National Report and World News Daily Report often take advantage of politically, socially, or religiously divisive issues to drive outrage-based traffic, Huzlers employs a markedly different approach to fake news hoaxes, often invoking the names of popular brands and restaurants in its quest to snare readers with gross-out stories.\n\nAmong Huzlers\u2019 most prominent yarns: Chipotle was caught using cat and dog meat in their dishes, Starbucks was discovered to be using semen in their beverages, Arizona iced tea tested positive for urine, and McDonald\u2019s was outed for including human meat in their products.\n\nLike its fellows, Huzlers tailors its scope to leverage topical news trends. A popular claim made by the site (at the apex of an Ebola outbreak) involved zombies, and another alleged that a man had traded his toddler to buy an Apple Watch.\n\nEmpire News\n\nEmpire News (spun off from what was initially a sports-related fake news site) is another outlet responsible for the propagation of fabricated claims that spread on sites like Facebook. Some of their stories are apolitical and simply compelling to readers, such as a claim the Netflix entertainment streaming service would be shuttering due to the negative impact of piracy, or one that Las Vegas planned to legalize dog fighting to boost casino revenues.\n\nOther Empire News hoaxes were somewhat news-based, such as one predicting massive national snowfalls for the winter of 2014-2015. Some articles targeted political or social controversies, such as one claiming a protestor in in Ferguson, Missouri, had accidentally burned down his own house. Separate rumors included one holding that Facebook was spying on gun owners for Homeland Security and one claiming that food stamp recipients would be awarded free cars (or that the food stamp program would be discontinued entirely).\n\nWhen Empire News created a rumor about a WalMart shoplifter reportedly caught with $100 worth of groceries stashed in her vagina, the claim was spread not only by social media users but also by other sites of dubious credibility (such as Huzlers and Daily Viral Stuff).\n\nStuppid\n\nFake news sites often play to users\u2019 existing beliefs to spread their claims, but Stuppid (a site that truly lives up to its name) is less focused in its contribution to the avalanche of fakery on the Internet. Efforts by Stuppid largely encompass morally offensive fabrications, such as a claim parents admitted to having sex in front of their kids to teach them about procreation, another about a Florida man marrying a baby, and a salacious tale of an incestuous mother-daughter relationship.\n\nStuppid frequently swipes publicly-available photographs such as mugshots and deliberately misattributes them, as they did in a story about two Floridians allegedly arrested for selling golden tickets to Heaven. Another such story involved a death row inmate\u2019s purported request for a last meal of kittens illustrated with a photograph of deceased serial killer Dorothea Puente.\n\nNews Examiner\n\nPaul Horner, the prolifically puerile online troll and ubiquitous fake news character (he inserts his name into all his articles) whose work previously appeared on the National Report fake news site, has since started the News Examiner. The News Examiner skirts Facebook\u2019s crackdown on fake news sites by mixing real news and listicle items in with its fake news reports, but the site neither identifies its fake news items as \u201csatire\u201d nor carries a disclaimer to that effect.\n\nFake stories from the News Examiner that have circulated widely enough as real news to prompt numerous inquiries from our readers include articles about the world\u2019s first successful head transplant and President Obama\u2019s limiting churches to offering twice-monthly services.\n\nNewswatch28 (now Newswatch33)\n\nNewswatch28 is a relative newcomer to the fake news world, bursting onto the scene in late April 2015 with a site that simulates a TV news web site and likewise skirts Facebook\u2019s crackdown on fake news by mixing real news articles in with its completely made-up stories.\n\nThe site\u2019s \u201cQuest\u201d page unhelpfully informs readers that Newswatch28 presents \u201cShocking news and stories, celebrity news and gossip. Whether currently occurring, interesting, controversial, abnormal, thought provoking or satirical, we only wish to inform and entertain with the content we publish.\u201d\n\nFake stories from the Newswatch28 that have circulated widely enough as real news to prompt numerous inquiries from our readers include articles about a 76-year-old woman expelled from a KFC for breastfeeding her 42-year-old son, the FDA\u2019s approving the sale of tranquilizer guns for use on children, and an Al Pacino death hoax.\n\nIn later incarnations, the hoax-purveyor became Newswatch33; among its newer pieces were items claiming that suspected Charleston shooter Dylann Roof raised $4 million in donations, that a study was paying subjects an exorbitant sum of money to smoke pot, that a man killed himself over black actors in Star Wars, and an iteration of the popular fake news claim that NASA confirmed a 15-day period of total darkness.\n\nNaha Daily\n\nThe Naha Daily appears to be defunct, but during that site\u2019s brief lifespan from September 2014 to January 2015 it published several fake news pieces that continue to pop up regularly on social media and web sites \u2014 most notably an article claiming that fashion CEO Michael Kors said he is tired of \u201cpretending to like blacks.\u201d\n\nThat item gained enough traction to prompt calls that Michael Kors be boycotted over his fictitious racist remarks:\n\n#BOYCOTTMK Michael Kors CEO stated \u201cI\u2019m tired of pretending I like blacks\u201d MK said \u201che doesn\u2019t want his purses filled with synthetic hair\u201d \u2014 Cheryl Nidoy (@TLV_Cher) January 7, 2015\n\nNaha Daily also made the pages of snopes.com with fake news pieces about Jaden Smith\u2018s plans to have his penis removed on his 18th birthday, Michael Jordan\u2018s indifference to kids dying over his sneakers, and Oprah Winfrey\u2018s accusing Bill Cosby of raping her.\n\nThe Stately Harold\n\nThe Stately Harold shouldn\u2019t be fooling anyone, given the deliberate misspelling in its name, a front page filled with articles by \u201cfeminist Cassidy Boon\u201d about such hard-hitting topics as \u201cRedefining beauty: Why cankles are hot!\u201d and an introduction from the Chief Editor that states \u201cHi!

Nwo I have!!\u201d\n\nNonetheless, now that social media users often never visit a site\u2019s main page, the Stately Harold has since its November 2014 start managed to fool readers with fake news articles about Hillary Clinton\u2019s wanting to ban beards, President Obama\u2019s referring to Baltimore rioters as \u201cblack heroes,\u201d a 9-year-old boy\u2019s being suspended from school for saying that he \u201cdidn\u2019t like Obama,\u201d and President Obama\u2019s pardoning Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.\n\nThe Stately Harold unhelpfully identifies itself as a \u201csatire\u201d site in a manner that is deliberately difficult for readers to find, requiring them to highlight the solid black background of a page footer to disclose the site\u2019s \u201csatire\u201d tag:\n\nNewsBuzzDaily\n\nNewsBuzzDaily is pretty low-rent for a fake news site: it doesn\u2019t display a logo or masthead on its pages, and it mainly traffics in lame, made-up, exclamation point-driven celebrity gossip items (e.g., \u201cLebron James Admits To Hair Transplant!!\u201d and \u201cWoman\u2019s Lips Explode After Doing Kylie Jenner Challenge!!\u201d) along with that lowest form of fake news, celebrity death hoaxes.\n\nNonetheless, the site has scored a few social media hits with puerile articles about Wendy\u2019s restaurants using rat and horse meat to make their chili, and the Fox Network\u2019s cancelling the popular TV series Empire after only a single season.\n\nNewsBuzzDaily at least scores some points for carrying a (somewhat less than clear) disclaimer on all their pages advising readers that the site is \u201ca combination of real shocking news and satire news\u201d and that \u201carticles written on this site are for entertainment and satirical purposes only.\u201d\n\nNow8News\n\nNow8News burst onto the fake news scene in mid-2015, racking up an impressive number of successful social media hoaxes despite the barely plausible premise upon which most were based: a man was arrested for having sex with a pig at Walmart, an obese woman was arrested for starving her kids so she could eat their food, a woman was arrested for \u201ctrying on\u201d tampons in an aisle at Walmart, a separate woman was arrested for using a sausage to sexually gratify herself (also at Walmart), a man was found cannibalizing a teen in a Texas haunted house attraction, KFC was busted breeding mutant chickens, and McDonald\u2019s closed 17,000 locations because the minimum wage was raised.\n\nThe site was also responsible for rumors that an old lady was arrested making cat fur coats, a man fed his cheating fiancee\u2019s remains to her parents, President Obama lowered the age of consent to 13, a lottery winner died after gold-plating his testicles, a couple was busted running a meth lab in the \u201cattic\u201d of a Walmart, hair elastics presented a grave health threat because they were manufactured from used condoms, a sitter discovered a \u201cclown doll\u201d was actually a tiny rapist, a tube of cookie dough \u201cexploded\u201d inside a female shoplifter\u2019s body cavity, and finally, that a woman caused a riot after experiencing gastric distress during a round of \u201cvodka butt shots.\u201d\n\nThe Reporterz\n\nMan Kills His Date After She, Inspired By Twitter #WasteHisTime2016 Trend, Wasted His Time: https://t.co/iS1KhkSZXu pic.twitter.com/1IJMa3dWob \u2014 The Reporterz (@TheReporterz) January 8, 2016\n\nA fairly new entrant to the fake news round-up in early 2016, The Reporterz started a popular hoax claim that a man killed a woman over her behavior following the #WasteHisTime Twitter trend. In addition, the site started a rumor that the state of Delaware was introducing a \u201cchild support card\u201d that limited what mothers can and cannot buy with their stipends.\n\nEmpire Herald\n\nAnother 2016 contender on the fake news scene was Empire Herald, which among other wild fabrications reported that a meth-addled couple ate a homeless man in Central Park. Created on 24 January 2016, the site managed to spread several (often recycled) fake news claims in the span of a few short weeks.\n\nSatira Tribune\n\nThe name Satira Tribune clued many readers in to this web site\u2019s intent, and its tagline (\u201csatirical news for satirical folks\u201d) certainly drove the point home to those who scrolled down to the bottom of the page. But that didn\u2019t stop the site\u2019s claims (that MMA fighter Ronda Rousey fought off several muggers, that Jimmy Carter said medical marijuana cured his cancer, that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) fined Bill Maher for smoking a joint on Real Time, or that Donald Trump paid Sarah Palin $10 million for endorsing him) from spreading on social media.\n\nNC Scooper (Nevada County Scooper)\n\nNC Scooper (or Nevada County Scooper) was one of the few ostensibly humor-based fake news sites whose items floated around social media. Most articles published by NC Scooper were clearly satirical in nature and not intended to deceive readers by spreading false information; nevertheless, a few efforts genuinely confused social media users. Among NC Scooper\u2018s crossover bits were pieces claiming official \u201cgun confiscation units\u201d were taking people\u2019s weapons, that Merle Haggard left his estate to an LBGT group, that Meg White of the White Stripes was joining Rush, and that Sen. Bernie Sanders called for \u201cchemtrail reform.\u201d\n\nAssociated Media Coverage\n\nAssociated Media Coverage was yet another fresh face on the fake news scene in early 2016. After its February 2016 creation, Associated Media Coverage swiftly leapt into the hoaxmongering business with bits about a motorcycle curfew, an e-juice ban, a two-pet maximum ordinance, and a fabricated claim that a transgender woman was shot in a Colorado department store bathroom.\n\nAssociated Media Coverage also has apparently spawned sites that appear to be legitimate local news bearing shocking (but fake) stories: Boston Tribune, Boston Leader, Baltimore Gazette, and Seattle Tribune are four that we have been able to identity so far.\n\nReact365\n\nReact365 isn\u2019t a fake news site per se, but rather a generator for user-created hoax articles. Although the site\u2019s stated purpose involved \u201cprank[ing] your friends,\u201d articles about mandatory babysitting by grandparents and great white sharks in the Mississippi River escaped into the social media wild.\n\nThe Burrard Street Journal\n\nLike Nevada County Scooper, the Burrard Street Journal appeared to be largely comedic in nature and not an intentional purveyor of hoaxes. Although most social media users seemed to recognize the site\u2019s purpose, Burrard Street Journal items were occasionally mistaken for real news. Those included claims Donald Trump opined America ought not to have \u201cgiven Canada its independence,\u201d President Trump declared Canadian women the States\u2019 largest threat after ISIS, and President Obama asserted he refused to leave office were Donald Trump elected.\n\nThe Last Line of Defense (The Resistance)\n\nAlthough The Last Line of Defense (The Resistance) carries a disclaimer, it is frequently mistaken for legitimate news about a bevy of topical controversies. Items published by this site which have duped social media users included claims the Obama girls were arrested in Hawaii, that George Soros was arrested for \u201chate crimes against America,\u201d and President Trump \u201cbilled\u201d former First Lady Michelle Obama for several billion dollars.\n\nAs American As Apple Pie and Freedum Junkshun\n\nLike The Last Line of Defense (The Resistance), As American As Apple Pie and Freedum Junkshun carry clear disclaimers warning readers they are fake news sites:\n\nWhen no one can trust the lying fake news liberal media anymore because they hate us and guns and Harley Davidson and meat and OUR president, As American as Apple Pie is here to be your beacon of something you can kinda rely on sometimes, but not really. God Bless America and Amen. We believe that there is nothing more precious than the mind of an aging conservative. Here we gather a boatload of bullhonkey, works of pure satirical fiction, to give the fist-shakers of the world a reason to hate. Reality is often in the eye of the beholder. You won\u2019t find any of it here. Join the fun in the comments on our Facebook page where you too can watch David Hasselhoff running over someone\u2019s poodle magically transformed into a crime against humanity by Barack Obama or yet another murder the Clintons got away with.\n\nNevertheless, their material is regularly shared as \u201creal news.\u201d Items from As American As Apple Pie mistaken for legitimate news included claims Alec Baldwin was arrested for threatening President Trump and a Muslim mayor \u201coutlawed Christmas\u201d within city limits. And like Last Line of Defense, As American As Apple Pie and Freedum Junkshun leverage topical controversies to accumulate social media shares using \u201coutrage bait,\u201d as did the latter with a phony story about a flight crew \u201ctaking a knee\u201d rather than transporting New Orleans Saints players who engaged in the referenced protest. A 27 October 2017 post to Last Line of Defense\u2018s Facebook page confirmed Freedum Junkshun is another of its operations.\n\nBreakingNews365.net and BreakingNews247.net\n\nLike React365, BreakingNews365.net and BreakingNews247.net are not fake news sites. Another series of prank generators, they enable anyone to create any headline and description complete with fabricated shares:\n\nAction News 3 (ActionNews3.com)\n\nLike Now8News, Action News 3 (ActionNews3.com) advances topical fake news items under the guise of a small local news affiliate. Specializing in death hoaxes (phony news items about Morgan Freeman, Bob Barker, and George Zimmerman went viral), the site also leverages social media fads like \u201ccreepy clowns\u201d to spread its falsehoods.\n\nabcnews-us.com\n\nMuch like abcnews.com.co, this site generates traffic by passing itself off as the actual website for ABC News. As we noted in December 2017, the site\u2019s front page, featuring a story about former Today Show host Matt Lauer, was designed to mimic that of ABC News:\n\nBeyond imitating ABC\u2019s page design, we found that abcnews-us.com also copied their actual reporting.\n\nWhile the myriad sites referenced here represent only a small sample of the overall \u201csatire\u201d nuisance on social media, many widely-dispersed fake news claims have originated with them. All of the sites mentioned above exist solely to spread false information, and none can be trusted as legitimate sources, no matter how compelling their claims might be.",
