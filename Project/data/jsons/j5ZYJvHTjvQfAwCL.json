    "content": "We know how the COVID-19 pandemic began : Bats near Wuhan , China , hold a mix of coronavirus strains , and sometime last fall one of the strains , opportunistic enough to cross species lines , left its host or hosts and ended up in a person . Then it was on the loose .\nWhat no one knows yet is how the pandemic will end . This coronavirus is unprecedented in the combination of its easy transmissibility , a range of symptoms going from none at all to deadly , and the extent that it has disrupted the world . A highly susceptible population led to near exponential growth in cases . \u201c This is a distinct and very new situation , \u201d says epidemiologist and evolutionary biologist Sarah Cobey of the University of Chicago .\nBut past pandemics do offer hints of the future .

Those that trigger pandemics have enough novelty that the human immune system does not quickly recognize them as dangerous invaders .

Those that trigger pandemics have enough novelty that the human immune system does not quickly recognize them as dangerous invaders. They force the body to create a brand-new defense, involving new antibodies and other immune system components that can react to and attack the foe.
