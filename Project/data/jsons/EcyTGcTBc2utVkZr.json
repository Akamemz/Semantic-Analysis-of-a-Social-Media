Young people are still protesting in large numbers every Friday , demanding greater democratic freedoms .\nStudents and other youth were at the forefront of efforts to unseat General Bashir and Mr. Bouteflika , but the ultimate outcomes in Sudan and Algeria are still unclear . And a number of historic Big Men \u2013 plus younger leaders apparently attracted to their style of governance and status in office \u2013 remain in power . Equatorial Guinea \u2019 s Teodoro Obiang Nguema is still ruling 40 years after he headed a military coup . In Rwanda , Paul Kagame shows no sign of leaving office , even 25 years after the rebel army he led ended the Rwandan genocide .\nHere in Uganda , President Museveni has used the ruling party \u2019 s overwhelming majority in Parliament to eliminate presidential term limits and abolish the age limit of 75 that would have stopped him from contesting the 2021 presidential elections . With the army loyal to him , a tame Electoral Commission , and extensive powers of patronage , Mr. Museveni has kept a firm grip on power for more than three decades .\n\u201c It \u2019 s clear he has no intention of leaving and he has all the power , so how are you going to win elections against him ? \u201d asks Joachim Buwembo , a political commentator in Kampala , the capital .\n\u201c Young people are very frustrated by the president , \u201d says one senior Western diplomat here . \u201c He \u2019 s been there forever . They see no future and they wonder how do they get him out . They are frustrated , but they don \u2019 t have solutions . \u201d\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Bobi Wine ( center , in white ) and his supporters walk to a prayer service for his driver , who was killed a year ago .\nIt took getting beaten up to spark Mr. Wine \u2019 s interest in politics .\nAbout 10 years ago , when he was famous only as a rapper , he drove to a nightclub in his new Cadillac Escalade SUV \u2013 the only one of its kind in East Africa . As he was leaving the club he was jumped by a young man , he says , \u201c who beat me up so bad , and asked me why I was showing off as if I didn \u2019 t know that this country had owners , \u201d referring to its rulers .\n\u201c I was the hot boy of the night until I was deflated by that beating , \u201d he says . \u201c That night was a very transformative night for me . Now we want to say that this country has owners and those owners are all of us . \u201d\nToday , the once brash Mr. Wine has left behind the strut and swagger of a bad-boy rap star . His heavily tattooed arms recall his past , but the dreadlocks are gone , and during an interview in the garden of his home outside Kampala , he is straightforward , speaking softly , in measured tones .\n\u201c I had to grow up much faster than my age , \u201d says the 37-year-old of his political education .\nAs a rapper , Mr. Wine made a name for himself across eastern and southern Africa and toured European capitals . He also amassed a small fortune : He is reportedly one of the richest musicians in East Africa .\nToday he lives behind high gates in Magere , a village 30 miles north of Kampala , in a whitewashed villa whose pillared terrace overlooks a well-watered lawn , immaculately trimmed by a gardener . It is decorated with a flock of plump guinea fowl .\nThe compound is a long way from the Kampala slum where he grew up , the sixth of 10 children , but he says he is \u201c proud that I came from the ghetto. \u201d To press the point , he sports a vanity plate on his Escalade that says GHETTO , and he has nicknamed himself the Ghetto President .\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Clenched-fist supporters of Mr. Wine , acting as his escort on motorcycles , arrive at his home in the village of Magere outside Kampala .\nAs Mr. Wine became more politically engaged , his lyrics grew more purposeful . In songs he branded \u201c edutainment , \u201d he sang about social issues and promoted personal hygiene and public health . Gradually , he became overtly political and critical of the government .\nWhen , in 2016 , Mr. Museveni won elections that international observers found neither free nor fair , \u201c I thought it was high time I stopped being a spectator or only a talker , \u201d Mr. Wine explains . So he ran for Parliament as an independent and won comfortably .\nPolitical success has turned his life upside down . For a start , he complains , the Museveni government has forbidden him to stage concerts and banned his songs from being played on Ugandan radio and TV . That hasn \u2019 t kept him out of his studio in Kamwokya , the slum where he was raised . He is currently recording an album to be called \u201c Forbidden Music , \u201d he says , that his fans will all be able to listen to on YouTube , regardless of the broadcast ban .\nAs we speak , a crowd of those fans and supporters can be heard in the road outside the gates , revving their motorcycle engines and demanding to be let in . They are the escort that will accompany Mr. Wine to the ceremony later that afternoon marking the anniversary of his driver \u2019 s death .\nThe escorts are a motley crew of young men , most of them wearing the red berets that signal their membership in the People Power movement , but they switch their engines off and glide quietly down the drive when they see that their hero is occupied .\nYasin Kawuma , the driver , was shot in the northern town of Arua last year during a crackdown by soldiers after Mr. Museveni \u2019 s motorcade was allegedly pelted with stones by opposition supporters following a campaign rally . Mr. Wine , who was in town campaigning with other opposition figures , was arrested along with his colleagues in a hotel far from the disturbance . He says he was beaten severely with iron bars and then tortured in the military vehicle that took him to jail . Detained for two weeks , he was charged with treason ( a charge that is still active ) before traveling to the United States for medical treatment .\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Wearing his trademark white caftan , Mr. Wine and others pay tribute to his late driver .\nThe violence of the government \u2019 s reaction , he says , suggests that the authorities are rattled . ( That impression would be strengthened a few weeks after our interview , when the government banned civilians from wearing red berets like Mr. Wine \u2019 s trademark headgear , on pain of life imprisonment . ) \u201c They are very scared of us and in a very shaky position , \u201d he insists , lapsing \u2013 as he occasionally does \u2013 into the royal \u201c we. \u201d \u201c As much as they \u2019 ve been able to intimidate a few people , \u201d he adds , \u201c they \u2019 ve also succeeded in emboldening us . \u201d\nThat doesn \u2019 t mean he doesn \u2019 t fear for his life . \u201c The regime is extremely threatened by the challenge we pose , \u201d he says . \u201c They seek to eliminate us once and for all . The regime in Uganda wants me dead as soon as yesterday . \u201d\nBut as long as he is alive he can be playful , despite the tension . \u201c Can I just kiss my wife ? \u201d he asks as Barbara Itungo Kyagulanyi , a social worker credited with raising Mr. Wine \u2019 s political consciousness and polishing his public image , appears from the house .\nWhy does Mr. Wine think he poses such a threat to the government ? \u201c Because we are the energy that seeks to unite all change-seeking forces in Uganda , \u201d he answers . \u201c We are the gum that seeks to bind all those other [ opposition forces ] so that we can exalt the people. \u201d The strategy is working , he claims , pointing to a string of parliamentary by-elections over the past two years in which candidates he backed were victorious .\nPeople Power , in Mr. Wine \u2019 s version of it , does not have the far-left connotations that the slogan carried in 1970s America . Rather , it sets \u201c the people \u201d against an autocratic president . People Power is not a political party , but a movement driven by young people . Its only ideology is embodied in the name itself .\nThe movement here is not the first of its kind in Africa , nor is this generation of youth the first to have been frustrated by a lack of opportunities . Yet Mr. Wine believes this wave of activism is different , both because of the number of young people involved and their ability to communicate .\n\u201c We are many . We are much more informed and connected than we have ever been , \u201d he says . \u201c I am placed in a generation that is unstoppable . \u201d\nBut first , the young people need to gather momentum , he adds . \u201c They have the power only if they choose to open their eyes to that reality . Our message has always been \u2018 assert your power , claim your power through your vote . \u2019 \u201d\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Kampala , the capital of Uganda , is a throbbing city of 1.6 million people that sprawls among rolling hills .\nAnd that will take organization . Voter registration drives will be key , Mr. Wine says , but mounting such initiatives in Uganda \u2019 s rural areas , where the vast majority of voters live , is not easy . The countryside has always been the stronghold of Mr. Museveni \u2019 s National Resistance Movement political party and his supporters control much of local government , not to mention the army and police . \u201c The government makes it extremely , extremely complicated for us to organize , \u201d Mr. Wine says . \u201c But we always find a way , clandestine-style . \u201d\nThe government could certainly manipulate the elections in a way that ensures Mr. Museveni \u2019 s victory , as Mr. Wine is well aware . He lays out what he thinks would be the consequences if it did so .\n\u201c If he tries to rig the elections , the people of Uganda will make sure it \u2019 s not business as usual , \u201d Mr. Wine says . \u201c He is going to lose to the people of Uganda by any ... legal and constitutional means necessary. \u201d He prefers not to specify what that might mean , other than to forswear violence .\nNor is he very specific about what exactly he would do if he were elected , since the People Power movement has no policy platform . Mr. Wine is impatient with efforts to press him on this issue and brushes them off . \u201c We don \u2019 t have institutions here ; we have Museveni , his family , and his hangers-on , \u201d he says . \u201c In a country where institutions are empowered and allowed to work , solutions will be there .\n\u201c Telling people that are enslaved in their own country , asking them for their policy alternatives is like asking a person that has not had a meal for a week whether they \u2019 ll have their eggs scrambled or otherwise , \u201d he says . \u201c All they want is to eat . And for starters all we want to be is free . We want to matter . We want our voice to count . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s as much of a policy statement as Timothy Ssimbwa needs to hear .\nA 26-year-old who teaches middle school history and religion , Mr. Ssimbwa has taken time off from marking exams to turn out today as a member of Mr. Wine \u2019 s motorcycle escort . Resplendent in bright red overalls and green beret , he explains that he likes Mr. Wine simply \u201c because he \u2019 s my hope . He \u2019 s a youth like me .\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Mr. Wine \u2019 s SUV bears the vanity plate GHETTO , which is a nod to the rapper \u2019 s upbringing in the slums of Kampala .\n\u201c He \u2019 s ordinary ; he grew up in the ghetto , \u201d Mr. Ssimbwa says , as he waits patiently in the shade of a garden awning for Mr. Wine to finish a series of press interviews . \u201c Since he \u2019 s ordinary , he \u2019 d be a good leader . \u201d\nMr. Wine \u2019 s appeal is not unlike Mr. Museveni \u2019 s in the days when he was leading a bush rebellion against Uganda \u2019 s then-President Milton Obote , suggests Aili Tripp , who teaches African politics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison . \u201c It \u2019 s all centered on an individual , \u201d Professor Tripp says , and carries a strong populist message . \u201c That \u2019 s hard to escape without a stronger tradition of democratic institutions . \u201d\nYet in order for Mr. Ssimbwa and other members of the youth movement to translate their passion into power , they will have to remain unified and persevere in challenging authorities . Young Africans \u201c haven \u2019 t had the organizational capacity or ideological connectedness ; they are still scattered , \u201d says Mwambutsya Ndebesa , a professor of history at Makerere University in Kampala . \u201c They are aware , but not conscious , \u201d he says , drawing a distinction noted by Brazilian educator Paulo Freire . \u201c Aware of being young people with unmet needs , but not conscious enough to take action . \u201d\nStill , Mr. Wine could be crucial in helping Uganda \u2019 s youth find their voice . While most young people are simply frustrated but don \u2019 t know more than to say they are unhappy with their situation , \u201c Bobi Wine and other younger politicians who are willing to say \u2018 we don \u2019 t agree \u2019 are creating a coherence in what people say \u201d beyond just their desire for jobs , according to the Western diplomat .\nThat kind of direction will be particularly important given the pervasive power of the government . \u201c Turning anger into consistent mobilization and demonstrations will take a high level of leadership \u201d in the face of official hostility , says Perry Aritua , who runs the Ugandan branch of the Women \u2019 s Democracy Network , a nongovernmental organization encouraging young women to run for political office . \u201c In Uganda we \u2019 ve yet to see the level of resilience needed to organize civic action . \u201d\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff \u201c Politicians don \u2019 t listen to young people . We are just seen as pawns during election campaigns. \u201d \u2013 Julius Kateregga , president of the Makerere University Students Guild , who ran for election as a People Power candidate\nA lot is at stake , should leadership falter . \u201c Youth has not always been on the side of good things here , \u201d says Mahmood Mamdani , head of the Makerere Institute of Social Research . \u201c They \u2019 ve provided the storm troopers for warlords and for government youth wings. \u201d The nature of any new youth wave \u201c will depend on what kind of leadership emerges , \u201d Professor Mamdani says .\nMr. Wine \u2019 s leadership of a national organization has yet to be tested , but he has proved he can be adaptable . Five years ago , the rap star was denied a visa to enter Britain , where he was due to play two concerts , because some of his song lyrics were violently homophobic \u2013 matching the prevailing culture in socially conservative Uganda .\nToday , in his songs and public statements , Mr. Wine expresses greater tolerance . \u201c He \u2019 s a genuinely curious person who wants to learn , \u201d says Jeffrey Smith , founding director of Vanguard Africa , an NGO promoting democracy in Africa , who has hosted Mr. Wine in Washington . \u201c I was skeptical about him ; I expected another brash guy who was all talk , but in fact he was here to listen and learn. \u201d While some young African populist political stars , such as Julius Malema in South Africa , have been accused of playing on divisions and fear , \u201c Bobi Wine is all about bringing disparate voices to the table , \u201d Mr. Smith says .\nMr. Malema is not the only young African leader whom Mr. Wine sees as a kindred spirit . He mentions the names of Nelson Chamisa , the opposition leader in Zimbabwe , Saulos Chilima \u2013 currently challenging the results of last May \u2019 s elections in Malawi \u2013 and jailed South Sudanese human rights activist Peter Biar Ajak .\nThere is little sign , though , that such disparate rising figures could lead a continentwide movement such as the Pan-African wave that swept post-colonial Africa . \u201c There is a concerted effort in different countries to talk to the youth , but the ideological approach of these young leaders , what \u2019 s driving them , is not clear , \u201d says Yona Kanyomozi , a former Ugandan government minister . \u201c That makes it difficult for them to work together . \u201d\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff \u201c Bobi Wine started in music ; that can really make youth engage in something productive. \u201d \u2013 Agili Prisca , a first-year student at Makerere University ( center ) , who sits with students Esther Adeke ( left ) and Asiimwe Dhurufah\nThere is certainly a huge potential following for such leaders : 78 % of Uganda \u2019 s population is under age 30 . At current growth rates , those under 24 across Africa will rise by more than 50 % , to 945 million , by 2050 .\n\u201c There is a big structural change in population across the continent , \u201d says Mr. Shepherd of Chatham House . \u201c Young people have very different outlooks and aspirations from their parents \u2013 they are globally connected and they do not want to be farmers .\n\u201c I see turbulence ahead , \u201d he adds . \u201c The big dynamic of the next two decades is how transformative this will be , whether the old guard will be able to absorb the momentum of this wave of change . \u201d\nRiding that wave , and trying to control it , will require different skills than merely stirring young people to action . \u201c Bobi and other young politicians understand that they have to show that they can be disciplined leaders when they may not have all the skills needed to be disciplined leaders , \u201d says the senior Western diplomat .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .

As he readies himself for his Muslim driver \u2019 s memorial service , slipping into a white caftan over his jeans and T-shirt , he reflects on his fate . He is not reveling in the moment , he says . How could he enjoy the concert ban , the beatings , and the endless court cases to which he has been subjected ?\n\u201c But because this is the predicament , this is the destiny , I am trying to learn to enjoy the struggle , \u201d he says . \u201c Because the struggle has become the way of life I \u2019 ve had to adjust to . Life is the way it is . Because this is it . \u201d",

His heavily tattooed arms recall his past, but the dreadlocks are gone, and during an interview in the garden of his home outside Kampala, he is straightforward, speaking softly, in measured tones.\n\n\u201cI had to grow up much faster than my age,\u201d says the 37-year-old of his political education.\n\nAs a rapper, Mr. Wine made a name for himself across eastern and southern Africa and toured European capitals. He also amassed a small fortune: He is reportedly one of the richest musicians in East Africa.\n\nToday he lives behind high gates in Magere, a village 30 miles north of Kampala, in a whitewashed villa whose pillared terrace overlooks a well-watered lawn, immaculately trimmed by a gardener. It is decorated with a flock of plump guinea fowl.\n\nThe compound is a long way from the Kampala slum where he grew up, the sixth of 10 children, but he says he is \u201cproud that I came from the ghetto.\u201d To press the point, he sports a vanity plate on his Escalade that says GHETTO, and he has nicknamed himself the Ghetto President.\n\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Clenched-fist supporters of Mr. Wine, acting as his escort on motorcycles, arrive at his home in the village of Magere outside Kampala.\n\nAs Mr. Wine became more politically engaged, his lyrics grew more purposeful. In songs he branded \u201cedutainment,\u201d he sang about social issues and promoted personal hygiene and public health. Gradually, he became overtly political and critical of the government.\n\nWhen, in 2016, Mr. Museveni won elections that international observers found neither free nor fair, \u201cI thought it was high time I stopped being a spectator or only a talker,\u201d Mr. Wine explains. So he ran for Parliament as an independent and won comfortably.\n\nPolitical success has turned his life upside down. For a start, he complains, the Museveni government has forbidden him to stage concerts and banned his songs from being played on Ugandan radio and TV. That hasn\u2019t kept him out of his studio in Kamwokya, the slum where he was raised. He is currently recording an album to be called \u201cForbidden Music,\u201d he says, that his fans will all be able to listen to on YouTube, regardless of the broadcast ban.\n\nAs we speak, a crowd of those fans and supporters can be heard in the road outside the gates, revving their motorcycle engines and demanding to be let in. They are the escort that will accompany Mr. Wine to the ceremony later that afternoon marking the anniversary of his driver\u2019s death.\n\nThe escorts are a motley crew of young men, most of them wearing the red berets that signal their membership in the People Power movement, but they switch their engines off and glide quietly down the drive when they see that their hero is occupied.\n\nYasin Kawuma, the driver, was shot in the northern town of Arua last year during a crackdown by soldiers after Mr. Museveni\u2019s motorcade was allegedly pelted with stones by opposition supporters following a campaign rally. Mr. Wine, who was in town campaigning with other opposition figures, was arrested along with his colleagues in a hotel far from the disturbance. He says he was beaten severely with iron bars and then tortured in the military vehicle that took him to jail. Detained for two weeks, he was charged with treason (a charge that is still active) before traveling to the United States for medical treatment.\n\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Wearing his trademark white caftan, Mr. Wine and others pay tribute to his late driver.\n\nThe violence of the government\u2019s reaction, he says, suggests that the authorities are rattled. (That impression would be strengthened a few weeks after our interview, when the government banned civilians from wearing red berets like Mr. Wine\u2019s trademark headgear, on pain of life imprisonment.) \u201cThey are very scared of us and in a very shaky position,\u201d he insists, lapsing \u2013 as he occasionally does \u2013 into the royal \u201cwe.\u201d \u201cAs much as they\u2019ve been able to intimidate a few people,\u201d he adds, \u201cthey\u2019ve also succeeded in emboldening us.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t fear for his life. \u201cThe regime is extremely threatened by the challenge we pose,\u201d he says. \u201cThey seek to eliminate us once and for all. The regime in Uganda wants me dead as soon as yesterday.\u201d\n\nBut as long as he is alive he can be playful, despite the tension. \u201cCan I just kiss my wife?\u201d he asks as Barbara Itungo Kyagulanyi, a social worker credited with raising Mr. Wine\u2019s political consciousness and polishing his public image, appears from the house.\n\nWhy does Mr. Wine think he poses such a threat to the government? \u201cBecause we are the energy that seeks to unite all change-seeking forces in Uganda,\u201d he answers. \u201cWe are the gum that seeks to bind all those other [opposition forces] so that we can exalt the people.\u201d The strategy is working, he claims, pointing to a string of parliamentary by-elections over the past two years in which candidates he backed were victorious.\n\nPeople Power, in Mr. Wine\u2019s version of it, does not have the far-left connotations that the slogan carried in 1970s America. Rather, it sets \u201cthe people\u201d against an autocratic president. People Power is not a political party, but a movement driven by young people. Its only ideology is embodied in the name itself.\n\nThe movement here is not the first of its kind in Africa, nor is this generation of youth the first to have been frustrated by a lack of opportunities. Yet Mr. Wine believes this wave of activism is different, both because of the number of young people involved and their ability to communicate.\n\n\u201cWe are many. We are much more informed and connected than we have ever been,\u201d he says. \u201cI am placed in a generation that is unstoppable.\u201d\n\nBut first, the young people need to gather momentum, he adds. \u201cThey have the power only if they choose to open their eyes to that reality. Our message has always been \u2018assert your power, claim your power through your vote.\u2019\u201d\n\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Kampala, the capital of Uganda, is a throbbing city of 1.6 million people that sprawls among rolling hills.\n\nAnd that will take organization. Voter registration drives will be key, Mr. Wine says, but mounting such initiatives in Uganda\u2019s rural areas, where the vast majority of voters live, is not easy. The countryside has always been the stronghold of Mr. Museveni\u2019s National Resistance Movement political party and his supporters control much of local government, not to mention the army and police. \u201cThe government makes it extremely, extremely complicated for us to organize,\u201d Mr. Wine says. \u201cBut we always find a way, clandestine-style.\u201d\n\nThe government could certainly manipulate the elections in a way that ensures Mr. Museveni\u2019s victory, as Mr. Wine is well aware. He lays out what he thinks would be the consequences if it did so.\n\n\u201cIf he tries to rig the elections, the people of Uganda will make sure it\u2019s not business as usual,\u201d Mr. Wine says. \u201cHe is going to lose to the people of Uganda by any ... legal and constitutional means necessary.\u201d He prefers not to specify what that might mean, other than to forswear violence.\n\nNor is he very specific about what exactly he would do if he were elected, since the People Power movement has no policy platform. Mr. Wine is impatient with efforts to press him on this issue and brushes them off. \u201cWe don\u2019t have institutions here; we have Museveni, his family, and his hangers-on,\u201d he says. \u201cIn a country where institutions are empowered and allowed to work, solutions will be there.\n\n\u201cTelling people that are enslaved in their own country, asking them for their policy alternatives is like asking a person that has not had a meal for a week whether they\u2019ll have their eggs scrambled or otherwise,\u201d he says. \u201cAll they want is to eat. And for starters all we want to be is free. We want to matter. We want our voice to count.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s as much of a policy statement as Timothy Ssimbwa needs to hear.\n\nA 26-year-old who teaches middle school history and religion, Mr. Ssimbwa has taken time off from marking exams to turn out today as a member of Mr. Wine\u2019s motorcycle escort. Resplendent in bright red overalls and green beret, he explains that he likes Mr. Wine simply \u201cbecause he\u2019s my hope. He\u2019s a youth like me.\n\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Mr. Wine\u2019s SUV bears the vanity plate GHETTO, which is a nod to the rapper\u2019s upbringing in the slums of Kampala.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s ordinary; he grew up in the ghetto,\u201d Mr. Ssimbwa says, as he waits patiently in the shade of a garden awning for Mr. Wine to finish a series of press interviews. \u201cSince he\u2019s ordinary, he\u2019d be a good leader.\u201d\n\nMr. Wine\u2019s appeal is not unlike Mr. Museveni\u2019s in the days when he was leading a bush rebellion against Uganda\u2019s then-President Milton Obote, suggests Aili Tripp, who teaches African politics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cIt\u2019s all centered on an individual,\u201d Professor Tripp says, and carries a strong populist message. \u201cThat\u2019s hard to escape without a stronger tradition of democratic institutions.\u201d\n\nYet in order for Mr. Ssimbwa and other members of the youth movement to translate their passion into power, they will have to remain unified and persevere in challenging authorities. Young Africans \u201chaven\u2019t had the organizational capacity or ideological connectedness; they are still scattered,\u201d says Mwambutsya Ndebesa, a professor of history at Makerere University in Kampala. \u201cThey are aware, but not conscious,\u201d he says, drawing a distinction noted by Brazilian educator Paulo Freire. \u201cAware of being young people with unmet needs, but not conscious enough to take action.\u201d\n\nStill, Mr. Wine could be crucial in helping Uganda\u2019s youth find their voice. While most young people are simply frustrated but don\u2019t know more than to say they are unhappy with their situation, \u201cBobi Wine and other younger politicians who are willing to say \u2018we don\u2019t agree\u2019 are creating a coherence in what people say\u201d beyond just their desire for jobs, according to the Western diplomat.\n\nThat kind of direction will be particularly important given the pervasive power of the government. \u201cTurning anger into consistent mobilization and demonstrations will take a high level of leadership\u201d in the face of official hostility, says Perry Aritua, who runs the Ugandan branch of the Women\u2019s Democracy Network, a nongovernmental organization encouraging young women to run for political office. \u201cIn Uganda we\u2019ve yet to see the level of resilience needed to organize civic action.\u201d\n\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff \u201cPoliticians don\u2019t listen to young people. We are just seen as pawns during election campaigns.\u201d \u2013 Julius Kateregga, president of the Makerere University Students Guild, who ran for election as a People Power candidate\n\nA lot is at stake, should leadership falter. \u201cYouth has not always been on the side of good things here,\u201d says Mahmood Mamdani, head of the Makerere Institute of Social Research. \u201cThey\u2019ve provided the storm troopers for warlords and for government youth wings.\u201d The nature of any new youth wave \u201cwill depend on what kind of leadership emerges,\u201d Professor Mamdani says.\n\nMr. Wine\u2019s leadership of a national organization has yet to be tested, but he has proved he can be adaptable. Five years ago, the rap star was denied a visa to enter Britain, where he was due to play two concerts, because some of his song lyrics were violently homophobic \u2013 matching the prevailing culture in socially conservative Uganda.\n\nToday, in his songs and public statements, Mr. Wine expresses greater tolerance. \u201cHe\u2019s a genuinely curious person who wants to learn,\u201d says Jeffrey Smith, founding director of Vanguard Africa, an NGO promoting democracy in Africa, who has hosted Mr. Wine in Washington. \u201cI was skeptical about him; I expected another brash guy who was all talk, but in fact he was here to listen and learn.\u201d While some young African populist political stars, such as Julius Malema in South Africa, have been accused of playing on divisions and fear, \u201cBobi Wine is all about bringing disparate voices to the table,\u201d Mr. Smith says.\n\nMr. Malema is not the only young African leader whom Mr. Wine sees as a kindred spirit. He mentions the names of Nelson Chamisa, the opposition leader in Zimbabwe, Saulos Chilima \u2013 currently challenging the results of last May\u2019s elections in Malawi \u2013 and jailed South Sudanese human rights activist Peter Biar Ajak.\n\nThere is little sign, though, that such disparate rising figures could lead a continentwide movement such as the Pan-African wave that swept post-colonial Africa. \u201cThere is a concerted effort in different countries to talk to the youth, but the ideological approach of these young leaders, what\u2019s driving them, is not clear,\u201d says Yona Kanyomozi, a former Ugandan government minister. \u201cThat makes it difficult for them to work together.\u201d\n\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff \u201cBobi Wine started in music; that can really make youth engage in something productive.\u201d \u2013 Agili Prisca, a first-year student at Makerere University (center), who sits with students Esther Adeke (left) and Asiimwe Dhurufah\n\nThere is certainly a huge potential following for such leaders: 78% of Uganda\u2019s population is under age 30. At current growth rates, those under 24 across Africa will rise by more than 50%, to 945 million, by 2050.\n\n\u201cThere is a big structural change in population across the continent,\u201d says Mr. Shepherd of Chatham House. \u201cYoung people have very different outlooks and aspirations from their parents \u2013 they are globally connected and they do not want to be farmers.\n\n\u201cI see turbulence ahead,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe big dynamic of the next two decades is how transformative this will be, whether the old guard will be able to absorb the momentum of this wave of change.\u201d\n\nRiding that wave, and trying to control it, will require different skills than merely stirring young people to action. \u201cBobi and other young politicians understand that they have to show that they can be disciplined leaders when they may not have all the skills needed to be disciplined leaders,\u201d says the senior Western diplomat.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

As he readies himself for his Muslim driver\u2019s memorial service, slipping into a white caftan over his jeans and T-shirt, he reflects on his fate. He is not reveling in the moment, he says. How could he enjoy the concert ban, the beatings, and the endless court cases to which he has been subjected?\n\n\u201cBut because this is the predicament, this is the destiny, I am trying to learn to enjoy the struggle,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause the struggle has become the way of life I\u2019ve had to adjust to. Life is the way it is. Because this is it.\u201d",
