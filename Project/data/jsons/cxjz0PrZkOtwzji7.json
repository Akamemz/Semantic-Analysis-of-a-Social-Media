    "content": "A recent US Supreme Court decision has jeopardized the asylum claims of tens of thousands of Central American , Caribbean , African , and Asian migrants hoping to enter the United States at the southern border . The decision has brought new anguish and uncertainties to those already facing desperate conditions in Mexico . On September 11 , the court ruled 5\u20134 to allow the Trump administration \u2019 s new asylum restrictions to go into effect , pending ongoing litigation . With limited exceptions , the measure prohibits anyone from requesting asylum at the US\u2013Mexico border who previously transited through another country , effectively banning all but Mexicans from seeking such protections . The asylum ban is the latest in an escalating effort to fence off the United States from the racialized global poor , while ICE purges the country from within . In the context of mounting economic and ecological crises , we are faced with an increasingly dire choice : surrendering to global apartheid , enforced by US imperial power , or a collective struggle , guided by solidarity .\nMexico Mexican president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador ( AMLO ) campaigned on a promise to respect migrants \u2019 human rights , and in the first months of his term issued over 13,000 humanitarian visas to migrants transiting through the country to seek asylum at the US border . But the visa program was short-lived , and in June , after Trump threatened to impose tariffs on Mexican imports , AMLO \u2019 s administration committed to reducing US-bound migration , deploying the newly formed National Guard to its southern border and agreeing to host US asylum seekers under what \u2019 s known as the \u201c Remain in Mexico \u201d policy . Mexico \u2019 s top migration official resigned in protest . For Genoveva Rold\u00e1n , economist and researcher at the National Autonomous University of Mexico , it \u2019 s a lose-lose situation . \u201c Mexico is a dependent country ; it doesn \u2019 t have the means , the economic autonomy [ to respond to Trump \u2019 s tariff threats ] like China did , to enter into a trade war with the United States , \u201d she says . \u201c Mexico is acting with a boot to its throat. \u201d The outcome of the negotiations , however , is disastrous . \u201c With this , Mexico has already tacitly become a Safe Third Country , \u201d says Rold\u00e1n . Under international law , Safe Third Country agreements can oblige migrants to seek asylum in countries of transit that can provide them adequate protections . Mexico , plagued by organized crime , corruption , and impunity , can not guarantee migrants \u2019 safety , and the meager existing services and infrastructure for migrants are already overwhelmed . \u201c They \u2019 ve put Mexico into a position where it \u2019 s not going to be able to respond , \u201d she warns . Xenophobia is rising across Mexico , and a humanitarian crisis rages at both borders . Mexico has detained more than 108,000 migrants in 2019 , over 32,000 of them children . Tens of thousands more wait their turn to present claims at the US border through an unofficial and arbitrary metering process . US hearings are now conducted remotely in \u201c tent courts , \u201d further violating migrants \u2019 right to due process and diminishing their chances of securing protections . Since July , the Remain in Mexico program has forced more than 42,000 applicants back into Mexico to await their asylum proceedings , where they are vulnerable to kidnapping and extortion . At least fifteen children have died at the border this year . \u201c It \u2019 s an abomination , \u201d says a US immigration attorney who works with migrants in Mexico , speaking anonymously for fear of reprisals from Mexican and US authorities \u2014 we \u2019 ll call him Alex . \u201c People are being killed after asking for asylum . . . It \u2019 s going to be studied in the history books as a stain . It already is a huge stain on the US . \u201d\nCentral America All this comes as the United States is pressuring vulnerable Central American countries \u2014 themselves the principal source of the current exodus \u2014 to block migrants transiting toward the United States . Panama has resisted US overtures . Guatemala , however , appears poised to implement a Safe Third Country agreement signed by the outgoing president , despite misgivings from the president-elect . Under the deal , migrants who pass through Guatemalan territory will be required to seek asylum there ; those who fail to do so will be ineligible for US protections and could be deported back to Guatemala . One of the most unequal economies in Latin America , Guatemala ranks in the top three countries of origin for US asylum seekers . El Salvador \u2019 s new president , who recently unveiled a new , US-financed border patrol , just made a deal with DHS to become a Safe Third Country in all but name . Honduras , wracked with violence and protest since a US-backed 2009 coup d \u2019 \u00e9tat installed a corrupt authoritarian regime , may soon yield as well . President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez , currently implicated in a major US narco-trafficking investigation , is in negotiations with DHS to harbor Nicaraguan and Cuban asylum seekers \u2014 and prevent them from continuing north . As Alex points out , \u201c these countries are in no condition to be able to house any significant number of refugees or asylees. \u201d Devastated by decades of US-backed genocidal anticommunist wars and neoliberal economic restructuring , Central America has expelled millions of its citizens to the United States , and indeed depends on those migrants \u2019 remittances for survival . The region boasts some of the highest homicide rates in the world , with social movement leaders particularly vulnerable to attacks . \u201c Safe Third Countries need to be safe , \u201d says Alex . \u201c There will be legal challenges to this in the US , and hopefully there will continue to be some sort of opposition in Guatemala and Honduras , because these are obviously farcical . \u201d\nLife or Death The United States hopes to render Central America and Mexico into prisons , each border another brick in Trump \u2019 s wall . Authorities are slowing the process and erecting physical and legal barriers in the hopes of discouraging migrants through attrition , or forcibly sending them back .

Migrants seeking to evade the authorities risk being preyed upon by organized crime in Mexico , drowning in the Rio Grande , or being driven into deadly deserts in the US southwest . More than 7,000 Africans have been trapped for weeks in Tapachula , the site of Mexico \u2019 s principal migrant detention center on the southern border with Guatemala , as Mexican authorities refuse to provide them with safe passage north . Alex describes Tapachula as a \u201c carceral city \u201d : \u201c There have been raids in public spaces , there \u2019 ve been raids in the hotels , so migrants aren \u2019 t as publicly visible anymore , \u201d he says . \u201c They \u2019 re trying to frustrate people and keep people in Tapachula , to make people fearful of being out in public . There \u2019 s a huge increase in checkpoints on the roads. \u201d The poorest and most vulnerable migrants , especially those who can not afford to hire a smuggler , bear the brunt of the crackdown . Alex explains : \u201c It creates a situation where there \u2019 s an increase in corruption , because the officers are still very much amenable to bribes . It also increases the vulnerability of women and LGBT migrants of sexual assault . And the traffickers are still getting people by that are able to pay the fees . They just charge more money and pay off the officials to be able to get through. \u201d For Bryan , a Honduran who separated from a caravan in January to request asylum in Mexico , the implementation of Trump \u2019 s asylum ban \u201c will only create a darker , sadder panorama , with more deaths and many more problems for people who migrate . But in the end , they won \u2019 t stop the migration. \u201d Bryan volunteers at a Mexico City shelter , where he provides migrants with legal information . He stresses the urgent need for humanitarian relief , especially for the growing numbers of those returning to the country through the Remain in Mexico program . \u201c They come back here , and they don \u2019 t have any options .
