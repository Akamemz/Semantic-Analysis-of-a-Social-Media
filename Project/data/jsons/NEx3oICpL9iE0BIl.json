It \u2019 s the last refuge of a scoundrel , but it \u2019 s also effective since no charge arouses greater opprobrium . In American politics , it \u2019 s a Grosse Bertha , a bunker-breaker which demands that the racist be shunned by all , which labels him a moral leper .\nIt \u2019 s what the accusation of heresy meant , during the wars of religion , or communism during the days of Joe McCarthy . And so it \u2019 s not surprising to hear it from Hillary Clinton , and especially so when Trump is courting her supporters in the African-American and Hispanic communities . It \u2019 s not even surprising to hear her dip into McCarthyite smears , the charge of guilt by association . She didn \u2019 t exactly say Trump was a racist , only that \u201c alt-right \u201d people are , that they support him , and that that kinda , sorta makes him a racist .\nI don \u2019 t much know the alt-right people . From casual observation , a few seem to be racists , most decidedly not . I wouldn \u2019 t even say that they \u2019 re the biggest racists around . If you \u2019 re looking for racism , the Black Lives Matter movement would be a good place to start . And you might also take a gander at Hillary Clinton . Asked to choose between \u201c Black Lives Matter \u201d and \u201c All Lives Matter , \u201d she chose the former . Then there was the Hillary Clinton who voted for an unrepentant Klansman , Robert Byrd , as president pro tem of the Senate .

Just the opposite . They \u2019 d be exquisitely solicitous , and determined to show through officious expressions of sympathy just how kind and thoughtful they really are .
