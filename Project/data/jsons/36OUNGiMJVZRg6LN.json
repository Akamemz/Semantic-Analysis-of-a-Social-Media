Amy Klobuchar announced her 2020 presidential intentions . `` I am running for this job for every person who wants their work recognized and rewarded '' and `` every parent who wants a better world for their kids , '' said Klobuchar . `` I am running for every American . '' And no matter what , `` I 'll lead from the heart . ''\nShe went on to call for a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United , for passing a law that automatically registers Americans to vote at age 18 , for universal background checks for gun owners , for `` sweeping '' legislation addressing climate change , and for `` net neutrality for all . ''\n`` If you do n't know the difference between a hack and Slack , it 's time to get off the digital highway , '' said Klobuchar in a cringe-worth line apparently meant to demonstrate her tech savvy .\nThe 56-year-old , three-term senator has received less national attention than fellow Democratic senators like Kamala Harris ( Calif. ) and Elizabeth Warren ( Mass . ) , both of whom have already announced their 2020 candidacies . Klobuchar could benefit from that if it means she 's seen as having less baggage , too . But that reputation suffered last week with the release of several stories describing her as a terror to work for .\nKlobuchar `` demeaned and berated her staff almost daily , subjecting them to bouts of explosive rage and regular humiliation within the office , according to interviews and dozens of emails reviewed '' by Buzzfeed . Her office had the highest staff turnover rate in the Senate between 2001-2016 , according to Politico .

Some suggested it was only an issue because she 's a woman .\nBut in general , and especially with Klobuchar campaigning as the nice Midwestern anti-Trump , her temperament behind the scenes matters . Blowing up at staff and driving them away at high rates do n't suggest `` Minnesota nice , '' nor someone who may handle presidential pressure well .

Another Klobuchar law expanded funding for the Department of Transportation to study and spread dubious propaganda about human trafficking . She 's also been an outspoken supporter of last-year 's federal ban on prostitution ads ( FOSTA-SESTA ) and a 2017 `` anti-trafficking '' measure that was full of civil liberties concerns .\nIn September 2017 , Klobuchar joined John McCain in trying to get tough on online political advertising in order to address alleged election interference .
