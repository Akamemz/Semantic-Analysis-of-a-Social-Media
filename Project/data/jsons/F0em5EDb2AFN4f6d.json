The job growth number , however , was well below the 185,000 that economists expected .\nWhat 's more , BLS said it still believes job growth was even more disappointing in December . When it initially reported that only 74,000 jobs had been added to payrolls that month , it was hoped the figure might later be revised upward . But today 's report showed almost no change : BLS now believes 75,000 jobs were added in December .\nThe news could add to concerns about a slowdown by the economy , and to some investors ' worries that the Federal Reserve is moving too quickly to `` taper '' the amount of stimulus it is giving the economy .\nThe Dow Jones industrial average and other indices were up slightly after about one hour of trading in New York . Investors may have decided the jobs report is n't so bad . Dan Greenhaus , chief global strategist at BTIG LLC , tells Bloomberg News that `` beneath the headlines , stuff was n't terrible . ... When you dig into the household survey , it 's not that bad . The participation rate went up , the labor force went up , the level of employment went up . ''\nUpdate at 9:50 a.m . ET . White House Focuses On Growth In Past 4 Years :\n`` Today 's report is another reminder of both the progress that has been made and the challenges that remain , '' White House economist Jason Furman writes . `` Businesses have now added 8.5 million jobs over the last 47 months and the unemployment rate ticked down to its lowest level in more than five years .

Although Employers Said They Added Only 113,000 Jobs , 638,000 More People Said They Were Working :\nAs happens each month , the BLS report has some apparently contradictory data . The figure on job growth \u2014 113,000 \u2014 is based on a survey of public and private employers . Another figure , though , appears to show more positive news : BLS estimates that 638,000 more people were employed in January than in December . That figure comes from a survey of households .\nOne explanation for the divergent views : 434,000 more people said they were working `` part-time for noneconomic reasons '' in January .

It adds that :\n`` Ms. Yellen did a masterful job of getting senators to warm to her during her confirmation hearings . But now she 's in the job , the questions could be tougher .

Did Bad Weather Skew The Jobs Figures ?\nHere 's some analysis from Kathy Bostjancic , director of macroeconomic analysis at the Conference Board , a business research group . She points to some reasons not to be too pessimistic based on the data in today 's report :\n`` A gain of only 113,000 new jobs in January , on the heels of the even slower gain in December , likely sparks uncertainty about the strength of the labor market and direction of the overall U.S. economy . `` Still , the three-month average of private payroll increase is holding up at 168,000 . Also , the revisions for 2013 show an adjustment of 509,000 more jobs by December than previously counted . `` There is no doubt that inclement weather in December played a role , although construction jobs held up reasonably well in January .
