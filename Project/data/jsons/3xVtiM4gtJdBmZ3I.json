But when you take a look at what our work is turning us into and what it 's actually accomplishing , it becomes clear that our priorities are all out of whack .\nIn his 2015 State of the Union address , President Obama spoke about important labor issues like unequal wages for women and a lack of paid sick and maternity leave . He called on Congress to pass legislation raising the minimum wage and requiring employers to guarantee at least seven days of sick time a year to their employees . He had to do this because , remarkably , nearly 40 percent of the American workers have no sick time at all , nor is there any requirement for their employers to provide any \u2013 a regressive distinction the United States shares with only two other countries , Papua New Guinea and Oman .\nHopefully these important issues will be brought to light as the 2016 presidential race heats up , especially with Bernie Sanders running . The anti-family nature of U.S. labor law should make it a logical target for any values-oriented crusader ; but predictably , Republican politicians oppose reform . While hiding behind a defense of small businesses , the Republican agenda is really a handout to mega corporations .\nWalmart , for instance , has been exposed for its discrimination against pregnant women , forcing them onto unpaid leave or firing them outright if they become unable to perform certain duties . In April 2014 , activists and employees forced the company to modify its policy , allowing for a \u201c reasonable accommodation \u201d to be made for women with \u201c a temporary disability caused by pregnancy. \u201d This weak and ambiguous concession leaves women with healthy pregnancies in the lurch , even though they still may require modified job duties .\nCongress could intervene and establish better protections for pregnant women , but it does n't . The 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act \u2013 the last such act passed on the federal level \u2013 is so feeble that a Walmart spokesperson in 2014 could truthfully say , \u201c We \u2019 re proud of our new policy . It is best in class and goes well beyond federal and most state laws. \u201d That reveals at least as much about federal and state laws as it does Walmart . The Waltons are among the wealthiest people on the globe , yet their business won \u2019 t guarantee American workers the fundamental dignity of having a child without fear of repercussion . And so it goes with workers ' rights across sectors of the economy .\nIn any moral society , this would be considered a crime . And in more advanced societies , Walmart is forced to grant their workers more rights , like unionization . Here , we \u2019 re dominated by politicians who argue the only crime would be if the state got involved at all .\nRepublicans scoff at emulation of the European model \u2013 which affords generous holiday , sick and paternal leave to workers \u2013 by pointing to Europe \u2019 s own unemployment epidemic and the fact that the American economy is recovering with almost all of its capitalist dogmas intact . Of course , what \u2019 s often left unsaid is that our rebound is being enjoyed overwhelmingly by only the wealthiest few . What value is a roaring economy to ordinary Americans who are overworked , overstressed , unable to spend time with their families , and not even reaping the financial benefits for their hardship ?\nEven office and white-collar workers , while generally receiving far greater benefits than low-wage retail and fast food workers , are woefully deprived when it comes to making room for their personal lives . Their hours are less rigidly documented and they are usually salaried , meaning they are more likely to be called on for unpaid overtime . They spend virtually their entire day in plywood boxes , a mentally stultifying way to invest one \u2019 s time . As more and more Americans live the sedentary , \u201c professional \u201d lifestyle , the disastrous health consequences of sitting around all day are becoming apparent .\nThere \u2019 s also a compelling argument , articulated brilliantly in a 2013 essay by author and activist David Graeber , that many white-collar and service sector jobs have no justifiable reason to exist . Says Graeber : `` It \u2019 s as if someone were out there making up pointless jobs just for the sake of keeping us all working . '' Professionals spend their days bounding from meeting to meeting and forwarding spreadsheets from one department to another . Customer service does little more than obfuscate information and bear the brunt of consumer rage . All this goes on with virtually no time off or flexibility , despite the economic and personally refreshing benefits of people controlling their own schedules . Working Americans passively accept that this is just life , but total conformity to the demands of a meaningless day job exacts a toll on their psyche and wastes the time and energy of skilled people who could otherwise be doing important work . These are not minor quibbles to be brushed aside with folksy idioms like `` Nobody likes their job '' and `` That 's why they call it work '' ; this is a crippling cultural sickness .\nAmerica is often heralded as a `` great experiment , \u201d but policy planners are at best unimaginative and at worst fiercely hostile when it comes to social experimentation .

Say what you will about capitalism \u2013 it \u2019 s not a system that rewards work based on its social value .
