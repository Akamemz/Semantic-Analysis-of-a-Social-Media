But the candidates did not make one move toward taking Donald Trump out . The broadcast network did ; the candidates did n't . `` On the day of the debate , Limbaugh talked on his show about an article on the DC Whispers website t hat claimed donors had contacted the candidates and put out an order to make Trump look bad during the debate.It was apparent that Fox News and its moderators got the order instead , Limbaugh said . `` I mean , let 's review , '' said Limbaugh . `` The first question from Megyn Kelly to Trump was , 'You 've called women fat slobs , pigs , whatever , ' and he said , 'No , just Rosie O'Donnell . ' '' The audience began laughing , and Kelly told Trump , `` No , its more than that , '' and then asked him if such statements belong in the White House , Limbaugh continued . `` Trump was clearly caught entirely off guard by it , and even today he said , ' I 'm not ...
