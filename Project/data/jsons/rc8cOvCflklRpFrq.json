    "content": "This is a rush transcript . Copy may not be in its final form .\nAMY GOODMAN : The Trump administration has rescinded key protections for transgender students in public schools . The move reverses President Obama \u2019 s landmark decision last May to order public schools to let transgender students use the bathrooms matching their chosen gender identity . The Obama administration had threatened to withhold funding for schools that did not comply .\nAccording to press accounts , there was a split in the Trump administration over the issue between Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos . The New York Times reports DeVos initially resisted signing off and told Trump she was uncomfortable because of the potential harm that rescinding the protections could cause transgender students . At a meeting on Tuesday in the Oval Office , the president sided with Sessions and pushed DeVos to drop her opposition , which she did . DeVos later issued a statement saying , in part , quote , \u201c This is an issue best solved at the state and local level . \u201d\nOn Wednesday , hundreds of protesters gathered outside the White House to call on Trump to protect transgender speakers . Participants included Gavin Grimm , a 17-year-old transgender student in Virginia whose lawsuit against the Gloucester County School Board has gone to the Supreme Court .\nGAVIN GRIMM : It \u2019 s frustrating that that was even proposed , but this isn \u2019 t going to stop us in our tracks . We \u2019 re going to fight as hard as we always have . And that doesn \u2019 t\u2014we \u2019 ll not slow down at any point and for any reason .\nAMY GOODMAN : Mara Keisling of the National Center for Transgender Equality also spoke outside the White House .\nMARA KEISLING : The worst-case scenario is what is already happening . Children all over the country are scared by this man . They are really worried that they \u2019 re going to go to school tomorrow , they \u2019 re going to be bullied . These are kids who have to go to school all the time worried about being bullied by other kids , being bullied sometimes even by educators . And now they have to worry about the attorney general of the United States and the president of the United States bullying them ? It \u2019 s just not OK .\nAMY GOODMAN : To talk more about President Trump \u2019 s decision to roll back protections for transgender students , we \u2019 re joined by Chase Strangio , staff attorney with the ACLU \u2019 s LGBT & AIDS Project . The ACLU is representing Gavin Grimm in his Supreme Court case .\nWelcome , Chase . Talk about the significance of what \u2019 s just taken place .\nCHASE STRANGIO : You know , thanks for having me . And yesterday \u2019 s action by the Trump administration was really just another example of mean-spirited targeting of vulnerable individuals\u2014this time , transgender young people . The protections that the Obama administration clarified in the guidance last year were incredibly important for this community that is so vulnerable to violence and bullying in schools . What \u2019 s important , though , is that as much as the Trump administration may want to change federal law , it \u2019 s still in the province of Congress and the courts . And so , yesterday \u2019 s actions , while sending a terrible message to the young people who are going to school in this country , young people who face incredibly high rates of suicide and harassment , it does not change the law . And that \u2019 s important , because the protections themselves come from Title IX , they come from the Constitution , and the president himself and his executive agencies can not change that .\nAMY GOODMAN : So this Supreme Court case that has been brought by Gavin Grimm , this Supreme Court case will determine what happens ?\nCHASE STRANGIO : Absolutely . Yesterday \u2019 s actions just highlight just how important this case is . This case before the Supreme Court involving Gavin Grimm , the 17-year-old boy from Virginia who \u2019 s being barred from the common spaces at his school just because he is transgender , his case is before the\u2014\nAMY GOODMAN : No , what do you mean ? Explain just\u2014he \u2019 s being barred from the common spaces .\nCHASE STRANGIO : His school has passed a policy , solely because his principal and his guidance counselor and the people closest to him at the school said , \u201c We understand that you \u2019 re a boy , and you will be allowed to use the boys \u2019 restrooms and other facilities , just like other boys. \u201d And his school board decided that that was unacceptable , and passed a policy targeting him , explaining that he , and he alone , is not able to use the shared restrooms and has to be banished to a separate , isolating , faraway and stigmatizing restroom .\nAnd he filed a lawsuit . The case is before the Supreme Court . The case is not mooted by yesterday \u2019 s actions , because the question before the court is : Well , what does Title IX mean when it comes to transgender students ? And courts , for many , many years , have made clear that prohibitions on sex discrimination include prohibitions on discrimination against people who are transgender because they are transgender .\nAMY GOODMAN : Let \u2019 s go to the White House press briefing yesterday with Press Secretary Sean Spicer talking about the Supreme Court decision .\nPRESS SECRETARY SEAN SPICER : There is a case pending in the Supreme Court in which we have to decide whether or not to continue to issue guidance to the court . We\u2014it \u2019 s not\u2014it \u2019 s dictated by that . The Obama administration had issued joint guidance from the Department of Education and the Department of Justice . We now have to decide whether or not this administration wants to continue that track that they were on . It \u2019 s plain and simple , if we don \u2019 t . But there are problems both in the legal and process way in which that guidance was issued . And so it \u2019 s incumbent upon us to actually follow the law .\nAMY GOODMAN : So that \u2019 s Press Secretary Sean Spicer talking about the Supreme Court case .\nCHASE STRANGIO : Yeah , and Press Secretary Spicer does seem a little bit confused about the case , because the United States is not a party to the case . The United States has no role . There \u2019 s no deadline impending for them . And the parties to the case\u2014Gavin Grimm and the Gloucester County School Board\u2014have agreed before the court that the court should resolve the substantive question about Title IX . So , there was no deadline with respect to that case . That case moves forward . And it is , in fact , the answer to the question of how we respond to this cruel action by the Trump administration that we saw yesterday .\nAMY GOODMAN : So , can you explain what these reports are in The New York Times and other places of the DeVos-Sessions battle in the Oval Office on Tuesday ? That \u2019 s Education Secretary DeVos , well known for years for her anti-gay stance , and Attorney General Jeff Sessions .\nCHASE STRANGIO : Well , I wasn \u2019 t there . It \u2019 s hard to know exactly what \u2019 s going on . I have to admit I \u2019 m a little bit surprised to hear it . I would have thought perhaps both DeVos and Sessions would have been very much in support of rescinding this guidance . Certainly , it is not a surprise from Sessions , who we are hearing is absolutely determined to roll back not only the guidance , but the substantive protections for trans individuals .\nWhen it comes to DeVos , what I can say is , I am imagining that she was presented with the very clear evidence that transgender students face high rates of bullying and harassment and suicide , and that the thing that helps protect trans students is respecting who they are and treating them like their other\u2014like their peers . And so , she must have thought , as she should , that perhaps it was a terrible idea to take away clarity about the protections for this population , when we know that with support and protections , trans students have comparable mental health outcomes to non-trans students , and , without them , they face rates of suicide attempts nine times their peers . So , the reality is that , you know , maybe she took a pause to think perhaps this was going to be a horrible idea . But , unfortunately , she caved .\nAnd the reality is that kids will be harmed by this . And , you know , I can \u2019 t say it more strongly , but the blood is on the hands of these lawmakers , who are making it a priority to make vulnerable kids feel less safe .\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to turn to Donald Trump himself . President Donald Trump was asked about transgender rights when he was running for president and appeared at a town hall event on NBC \u2019 s Today show . This was last April .\nWILLIE GEIST : [ reading ] \u201c Mr . Trump , please be specific . Tell us your views on LGBT , how you plan to be inclusive as president . Speak about North Carolina bathroom law , in particular . \u201d\nDONALD TRUMP : Oh , I had a feeling that question was going to come up , I will tell you . Well , look , North Carolina did something , was very strong , and they \u2019 re paying a big price . And there \u2019 s a lot of problems . And I heard\u2014one of the best answers I heard was from a commentator yesterday saying , \u201c Leave it the way it is right now . There have been very few problems . Leave it the way it is. \u201d North Carolina , what they \u2019 re going through with all of the business that \u2019 s leaving and all of the strife and\u2014and that \u2019 s on both sides . You leave it the way it is . There have been very few complaints the way it is . People go , they use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate . There has been so little trouble . And the problem with what happened in North Carolina is the strife and the economic\u2014I mean , the economic punishment that they \u2019 re taking . So , I would say that \u2019 s probably the best plan .\nWILLIE GEIST : Do you have any transgender people working in your organization ?\nDONALD TRUMP : I really don \u2019 t know . I probably do . I really don \u2019 t know .\nWILLIE GEIST : So , if Caitlyn Jenner were to walk into Trump Tower and want to use the bathroom , you would be fine with her using any bathroom she chooses ?\nAMY GOODMAN : So , Caitlyn Jenner could use any bathroom she chooses in Trump Tower , candidate Donald Trump said . But President Donald Trump has gone with a very different approach .\nCHASE STRANGIO : You know , that was a surprising amount of clarity from then-candidate Trump on the issue . And I think what it reflects is that when people first think about this , it makes perfect sense to not worry about where people go to the bathroom , because actually we \u2019 ve all been using the bathroom , trans people and non-trans people alike , for a very long time with no problems . And the emphasis on trying to expel trans people from the bathrooms we \u2019 ve been using for decades is , in fact , creating the problems . I think what we \u2019 ve seen now in his shift of position is , you know , he \u2019 s being caught up in the rhetoric that is really about demonizing trans individuals and making it seem not palatable to share public space with us . But that \u2019 s just simply not a tenable position .\nAnd when it comes to the idea of states \u2019 rights , federal civil laws\u2014federal civil rights laws are , by definition , designed to create federal standards when it comes to civil rights . So there \u2019 s no way that he can , you know , relegate this to the states , when we \u2019 re talking about the United States Constitution and federal civil rights laws , which , by their definition , are designed to ensure that people \u2019 s rights can \u2019 t be rolled back at the state level .\nAMY GOODMAN : So , just two days before President Obama left office , he spoke about the change over the last decade around LGBTQ rights .\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : I \u2019 m proud that in certain places we maybe provided a good block downfield to help the movement advance . I don \u2019 t think it is something that will be reversible , because American society has changed , the attitudes of young people , in particular , have changed . That doesn \u2019 t mean there aren \u2019 t going to be some fights that are important\u2014legal issues , issues surrounding transgender persons . There are still going to be some battles that need to take place .\nAMY GOODMAN : That was President Obama right before he left office , Chase .\nCHASE STRANGIO : You know , he \u2019 s right . You know , one of the key things he said is that we are not going to roll back the progress . And that \u2019 s absolutely right . Not only does this action by the Trump administration not change the substantive legal protections , but the reality is that there \u2019 s a movement of people supporting the trans community , trans people are out there speaking for themselves , and that to the extent people \u2019 s answer to the question of what to do about trans people existing in the world is to tell us not to exist at all , that is just simply not tenable , and people will not stand for that . And I know that we will continue to march forward , and we will continue to stand beside the young people , particularly , who are taking on so much .\nAMY GOODMAN : You know , on June 12th , it was Omar Mateen , a 29-year-old security guard , who opened fire in the Pulse nightclub in Orlando and killed 49 people and wounded 53 others in a clear terrorist attack . After the Orlando shooting , Michigan lawmaker Jeremy Moss tweeted , \u201c I literally never want to hear again that LGBT people in the bathroom are a threat to public safety. \u201d So what happens next , Chase ?\nCHASE STRANGIO : You know , what happens next is we tell the young people and their families that we will not stop fighting for them , and we tell everyone in this country to mobilize around the Supreme Court case that \u2019 s happening , with arguments on March 28th , because that is where we will continue to make our case for the protections that transgender individuals need , and we will stand in solidarity with all of the communities being targeted by this administration .\nAMY GOODMAN : And if a child or anyone is harassed in school , wherever , what can they do ?\nCHASE STRANGIO : If a child is harassed , if they \u2019 re denied access to the restroom , they can contact their local ACLU office . They can contact any organization that works with the LGBT community in their state . They can find me on Twitter . They can search for other people who are out there . We will not be silent , and we will not let people be isolated and targeted , no matter how much targeting happens from the federal government and down into the states .\nAMY GOODMAN : Chase Strangio , thank you very much for joining us . Chase Strangio is staff attorney at the ACLU .\nWhen we come back , we go to North Dakota to the standoff at Standing Rock . Stay with us .",
