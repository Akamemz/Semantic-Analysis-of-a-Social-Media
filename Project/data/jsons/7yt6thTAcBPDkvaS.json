Ninety million sounds like a lot , but that means that less than 40 percent of the electorate will bother to vote , even though candidates , advocacy groups and shadowy \u201c super PACs \u201d will have spent more than $ 1 billion to air more than two million ads to influence the election .\nThere was a time when midterm elections made sense \u2014 at our nation \u2019 s founding , the Constitution represented a new form of republican government , and it was important for at least one body of Congress to be closely accountable to the people . But especially at a time when Americans \u2019 confidence in the ability of their government to address pressing concerns is at a record low , two-year House terms no longer make any sense . We should get rid of federal midterm elections entirely .\nThere are few offices , at any level of government , with two-year terms . Here in Durham , we elect members of the school board and the county sheriff to terms that are double that length . Moreover , Twitter , ubiquitous video cameras , 24-hour cable news and a host of other technologies provide a level of hyper-accountability the framers could not possibly have imagined . In the modern age , we do not need an election every two years to communicate voters \u2019 desires to their elected officials .\nBut the two-year cycle isn \u2019 t just unnecessary ; it \u2019 s harmful to American politics .\nThe main impact of the midterm election in the modern era has been to weaken the president , the only government official ( other than the powerless vice president ) elected by the entire nation . Since the end of World War II , the president \u2019 s party has on average lost 25 seats in the House and about 4 in the Senate as a result of the midterms .
