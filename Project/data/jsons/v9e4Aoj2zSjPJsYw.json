We are reviewing next steps . '' https : //t.co/jqlx9CrzbN \u2014 Oliver Darcy ( @ oliverdarcy ) August 22 , 2019\nThe statement , provided to The Wrap and quoted on Twitter by CNN writer Oliver Darcy , comes more than six hours after \u2588\u2588\u2588 first published an exclusive expose into New York Times \u2019 politics editor Tom Wright-Piersanti \u2019 s racist and antisemitic tweets . After \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 original piece , Wright-Piersanti deleted many of the tweets admitting they were \u201c offensive \u201d and apologized .\nI have deleted tweets from a decade ago that are offensive . I am deeply sorry . \u2014 Tom Wright-Piersanti ( @ tomwp ) August 22 , 2019\nIn his apology , he does not explain why the tweets were \u201c offensive \u201d and brushes off the comments as \u201c from a decade ago. \u201d The Times , through spokeswomen Danielle Rhoades-Ha and Eileen Murphy , has not replied to repeated requests for comment from \u2588\u2588\u2588 on whether they think his actions are enough , or whether Executive Editor Dean Baquet has become involved in this matter .\nWhite House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham told \u2588\u2588\u2588 exclusively in response to the first piece exposing Wright-Piersanti that she and the White House were \u201c disgusted \u201d by the comments he made about Jews and others .\n\u201c I am disgusted but not surprised by this latest revelation out of the New York Times , \u201d Grisham said in a statement provided exclusively to \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c Will there be consequences ? Doubtful . The New York Times is too busy weaponizing journalism to harass this President and the people who work for him to bother holding their own people accountable . \u201d\nWright-Piersanti has been criticized from all sides in the wake of these revelations , as has the New York Times . In a phone interview on Thursday , Zionist Organization of America ( ZOA ) president Mort Klein called on the Times to fire him immediately and launch an internal review of the newspaper \u2019 s hiring practices and editorial processes .\n\u201c First of all , the New York Times should fire this editor immediately , \u201d Klein , a leading pro-Israel voice in America , said . Klein continued :\nIf he had come out with tweets making these types of remarks against blacks or gays or women , he \u2019 d be gone in a nanosecond . Why is there a different standard when you attack Jewish people ? So he should be fired immediately . With respect to the New York Times , the newspaper who for decades has been biased against and hostile to the Jewish state of Israel in article after article , editorial after editorial\u2014a newspaper that only recently had the most vicious antisemitic cartoon , it should be a newspaper that is overly sensitive to refrain from appearing hostile to Jews and immediately take action against an antisemitic editor and make a public statement concerning this issue .\nMurphy and Rhoades-Ha continue to refuse to answer whether the Times will proceed with a newspaper-wide review of editorial processes , hiring practices , and staff comments to determine if others exist in a place that has harbored Wright-Piersanti for more than five years despite these publicly available antisemitic and racist views . But Klein told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that given this , plus the Times \u2019 problems with antisemitic cartoons and other recent racist and antisemitic scandals inside the newspaper , a company-wide audit is a must\u2013especially with rising antisemitism from leftist Democrats such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D-NY ) , Rashida Tlaib ( D-MI ) , and Ilhan Omar ( D-MN ) .\n\u201c I think given the decades of bias and bigotry against the Jewish state that has come from the New York Times , it is time to do a serious audit to determine why almost all of their reporters and all of their editorial writers are openly hostile to the Jewish state , \u201d Klein said . Klein continued :\nTheir bigotry against Israel is so consistent , so pervasive , that it has to be more than a coincidence of some sort . They really should re-evaluate why they \u2019 re allowing this bias that they would never allow against blacks or gays or women or hispanics . Why are they allowing this against Jews ? In an era of rising antisemitism and attacks against Jewish people , and overt antisemitism from Congresswomen like Tlaib , Omar , and AOC , it is a time where the New York Times should be especially sensitive to not increasing enmity toward the Jewish state of Israel and the Jewish people .\nTrump campaign adviser Katrina Pierson added that the Times should hire an outside counsel , an independent law firm , to conduct the company-wide review into antisemitism and racism pervasive throughout the newspaper .\n\u201c Combined with other recent scandals like the publication of antisemitic cartoons and racist tweets that led to the demotion of another political editor in the Times \u2019 newsroom , it is long past time for the New York Times to hire an independent outside counsel legal firm to conduct a thorough review of the newspaper \u2019 s entire staff , hiring practices , and all editorial processes , \u201d Pierson told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nSeveral others , including many top Republicans such as Rep.
