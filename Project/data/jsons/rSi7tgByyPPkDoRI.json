Khan said Monday , underscoring the high stakes of grueling negotiations .\nIn an exclusive interview with The \u2588\u2588\u2588 , Mr. Khan said the two sides have reached a crucial moment \u2014 despite continued Taliban attacks and a spike in American strikes against the radical Islamist movement \u2019 s top targets \u2014 to solidify a cease-fire agreement that could wind down two decades of conflict and bring to a close the longest war in U.S. history .\nPresident Trump has pressed for a deal with the Taliban and the U.S.-backed government in Kabul that would allow him to draw down the estimated 12,000-plus American combat troops based in the country , but both sides have balked when a deal appeared in sight over the past year .\n\u201c What is the alternative ? \u201d Mr. Khan said . \u201c There is no military solution . You have tried it with a much larger military presence there , and that did not result in peace . \u201d\nIn a wide-ranging conversation with The Times , Pakistan \u2019 s top diplomat in Washington slammed India \u2019 s actions in recent months in Kashmir , warned of a potential refugee crisis if the Kashmir dispute isn \u2019 t resolved peacefully and urged the U.S. and Iran to cool tensions or risk further destabilization of a fragile region .\nMr. Khan also said Pakistan is thankful for White House efforts to tamp down conflicts between India and Pakistan over Kashmir .\nMr. Trump is set to visit India , but not Pakistan , at the end of the month , and speculation is mounting over what the U.S. president will say to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding the long stalemate over Kashmir .\nOn Afghanistan , Mr. Khan said a deal between the U.S. and Taliban leaders is easier than the next step : formal talks between the Taliban and the Kabul government .\nTaliban leaders have refused to recognize the Afghan government and have steadfastly rejected face-to-face talks despite American prodding .\nDespite the painfully slow process of reaching an agreement and the Trump administration \u2019 s clear frustration that the Taliban have not ceased violent attacks , Mr. Khan said this year represents a golden opportunity .
