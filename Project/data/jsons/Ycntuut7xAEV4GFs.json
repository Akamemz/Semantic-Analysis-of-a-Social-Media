    "content_original": "ANALYSIS/OPINION:\n\nIvanka Trump has apparently, reportedly \u2014 according to various media outlets \u2014 used her private email account for official government White House business.\n\nAnd now you\u2019ve got the leftists in the country and media drawing parallels between her email use and Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server, saying, seriously now, that conservatives who chanted \u201cLock her up\u201d for the latter ought now, to avoid a label of hypocrisy, call for the same on the former.\n\nSeriously now.\n\nThe difference is momentous.\n\nIn the world of political scandals, it\u2019s like Trump took a nibble of apple while Clinton reaped an entire orchard.\n\nHere\u2019s the difference: Trump used her personal email account while \u201ctransitioning into government,\u201d said Peter Mirijanian, a spokesperson for Trump\u2019s ethics attorney, Abbe Lowell.\n\nClinton, on the other hand, set up a whole private email server system inside her White Plains, New York, home, which she then proceeded to use to send and receive official \u2014 and, as the FBI later noted, sensitive and top secret \u2014 information, the extent of which America will never know because 31,000 of those messages were deleted.\n\nPotatoes, potahtoes?\n\nThat\u2019s an understatement.\n\nYet the left is going nuts, thinking it\u2019s stumbled on to its latest \u201cimpeach Trump\u201c-like moment, and that it can somehow turn this email issue into the next Watergate.\n\n\u201c#Ivanka sent hundreds of emails re gov\u2019nt business on her personal server!\u201d screamed Hollywood\u2019s Bette Midler on Twitter. \u201cAll I can do is repeat what her father said when Hillary did something not unlike what his First Daughter did!! LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP!!! LOCK HER UP!! How do you like it now, putz?\u201d\n\nSocial media is buzzing with more of the same.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House has rushed to defend.\n\n\u201cTo address misinformation being peddled about Ms. Trump\u2019s personal email,\u201d he went on, in a statement to Fox News, \u201cshe did not create a private server in her house or office, there was never classified information transmitted, the account was never transferred or housed at Trump Organization, no emails were ever deleted, and the emails have been retained in the official account in conformity with records preservation laws and rules.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s be clear here: Trump\u2019s use of a private email account for official business is wrong. She should make public immediately whatever messages fall under the label of public.\n\nMoreover, no government official, whether White House or county government supervisor, should be allowed to slide past the public\u2019s eye by using private email accounts to conduct public, taxpayer business.\n\nBut let\u2019s also be real here: It\u2019s done all the time. All the time, by most all public servants, from all political walks and parties and ideologies. Thinking otherwise is a bit naive. That\u2019s why the Freedom of Information Act is necessary; if public servants were naturally transparent, there would be no need for sunshine protections for citizens.\n\nWhat\u2019s not always done?\n\nConstructing private email servers in one\u2019s home so as to avoid any accountability and scrutiny at all. Constructing private email servers in one\u2019s home and then deleting scores upon scores of government information, so as to \u2014 again \u2014 avoid any accountability and scrutiny at all.\n\nWhen Trump does that, sound the alarms.
