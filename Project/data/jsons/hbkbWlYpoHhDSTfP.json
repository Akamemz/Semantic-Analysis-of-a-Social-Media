It cost a few billion , but the budget for it was there , and it saved many billions more . Microsoft also liked it , of course , as it saved it the hassle of organising multiple sales with the many different parts of the service . As I understood it , the Cabinet Office stopped it dead .\nAt the time , I was one of a group of NHS users consulted by those preparing the case for the arrangement to be continued . We were all shocked when it wasn \u2019 t renewed . Many people argued it was a mistake at the time . This relatively basic IT ( Windows , Office , Mail , SQL server , and so forth ) cost the NHS far more as a result . Further , the lack of the single agreement effectively moved the cost of upgrades on to individual hospitals , community providers , GPs and commissioners , and no new money was made available by the coalition government to help these individual units close the gap .\nObviously , directors of finance looked sceptically at new requests to upgrade systems that seemed to be working perfectly OK , and with the huge pressures on NHS budgets that we all know about , it is perhaps understandable that other local priorities were addressed first . I suspect this goes some way to explain why the NHS was hit harder than many organisations by the recent malware attack \u2013 as a result of that single bad decision , the service contains far more older systems which can \u2019 t be or haven \u2019 t been updated .\n\u2022 The \u201c ransomware \u201d attacks targeted PCs which use Windows XP \u2013 this is an old operating system and has security flaws .

Microsoft stopped issuing security patches for XP in 2014 , which means that organisations who use XP have major security risks .\nThe real question is this : who is holding whom to ransom ?

Microsoft issued almost daily warnings not to continue using the XP operating system back in 2014 when it withdrew all support for this , and almost all NHS staff upgraded their own systems at home . The only reason the service as a whole did not take the necessary action was that managers preferred to invest incredible sums of money in a vast centralised computer network which failed to materialise while completely ignoring these warnings , and remedial action will now be very expensive , not to mention the cost of this failure to patient \u2019 s lives .\n\u2022 Top civil servants in Whitehall have been pushing government organisations like the NHS into keeping computer records only , without any paper alternative or back up , for the best part of a decade .
