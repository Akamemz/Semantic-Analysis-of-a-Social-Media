What Clinton did the day of the Benghazi attack\nJUST WATCHED Clinton tears up at Benghazi hearing Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Clinton tears up at Benghazi hearing 01:16\nJUST WATCHED Clinton , senators clash over Benghazi Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Clinton , senators clash over Benghazi 04:11\nJUST WATCHED Clinton 's heated exchange over Benghazi Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Clinton 's heated exchange over Benghazi 01:10\nClinton spent the better part of last September 11 trying to get a handle on security at several other U.S. embassies in the Middle East where anti-American protests were in full swing over an anti-Muslim film produced in the United States .\nShe said the U.S. embassy was `` under assault '' by crowds trying to scale the wall . American embassies in Yemen and Tunisia were also facing a `` serious threat . Clinton personally called the president of Tunisia , she said , to `` beg him to send reinforcements , which he did , to finally save our embassy . ''\nBy 4 p.m. that day , Clinton was notified about the Benghazi attack . In the coming hours , she was in meetings and spoke with staff , the American Embassy in Tripoli and other U.S. officials .\nDirecting the U.S. response from the State Department , Clinton stayed in touch with officials across the administration and with the Libyan government .\nShe instructed her staff to `` consider every option , to just break down the doors of the Libyan officials to get as much security support as we possibly could . ''\nClinton said in the hours and days following the attack in Benghazi , there were `` no delays in decision-making . No denials of support from Washington or from our military , '' something an independent board established to review the matter cited in its report .\n2 . U.S. diplomatic posts in some 20 countries under threat\n`` Sitting here today , we probably have at least 20 other posts that are under a serious threat environment as I speak to you , '' she told senators . `` We operate in places where we know that our facilities are being surveilled for potential attacks where we have a steady Intel stream of plotting . ''\nClinton detailed what the State Department has done to begin implementing the 29 recommendations of the Accountability Review Board to improve security at diplomatic posts in high-threat areas , in addition to a few of her own .\nJUST WATCHED Sen. Paul : I would have fired Clinton Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Sen. Paul : I would have fired Clinton 03:10\nJUST WATCHED Heated exchanges at Benghazi hearing Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Heated exchanges at Benghazi hearing 04:16\nSpecifically , Clinton has appointed a team , led by her deputy , to focus on tightening security , sent joint teams of military special forces and diplomatic security threat analysts to more than a dozen high-risk posts and appointed a senior official to focus exclusively on those areas .\nThe State Department is also working to streamline requests for security so they make their way more quickly up the chain of leadership .\nDespite the threat , Clinton stressed the importance of U.S. leadership and diplomatic presence in the Middle East .\n`` We 've come a long way in the past four years , and we can not afford to retreat now , '' Clinton told senators . `` When America is absent , especially from unstable environments , there are consequences . Extremism takes root , our interests suffer , our security at home is threatened . ''\nClinton grew emotional and held back tears when talking about U.S. personnel killed in the Benghazi attack .\n`` For me , this is not just a matter of policy , it 's personal . I stood next to President Obama as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews , '' Clinton said as she choked back tears . `` I put my arms around the mothers and fathers , the sisters and brothers , the sons and daughters , and the wives left alone to raise their children . ''\nBut she lost patience with the focus of Republican senators on talking points used by U.N . Ambassador Susan Rice on the next Sunday 's talk shows that focused on a protest at the U.S. post in Benghazi , which turned out not to have taken place .\nWhen Sen. Ron Johnson pressed Clinton on why the State Department did n't call U.S. personnel who were evacuated from Benghazi to determine whether there was a protest , Clinton took him to task .\n`` With all due respect , the fact is we had four dead Americans , '' Clinton reminded Johnson as she banged her hand on the table .\n`` Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided they 'd go kill some Americans ? What difference , at this point , does it make ? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening , '' she said .\n4 . Militants in Mali and Algeria have arms from Libya\nClinton warned the security situation in northern Mali , where international forces are battling militants , has been exacerbated by flow of weapons from neighboring Libya following the fall of Moammar Gadhafi .\nShe said there was `` no doubt '' such weapons were also used in an attack by militants on an Algerian natural gas plant last week .\nShe noted the aftermath of the Arab spring has changed power dynamics and stretched security forces across the region thin .\nCalling the campaign struggle against the Islamic fighters a necessary response to `` a very serious , ongoing threat , '' Clinton said the `` United States can not permit northern Mali to become a safe-haven for Islamist rebels that could eventually pose a more direct threat to U.S . interests . ''\nNoting the increased strength of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb , the regional affiliate of the al Qaeda network fighting along side local Malians , Clinton warned that the United States must prepare for the possibility that groups like AQIM could threaten direct attacks on U.S. interests as they gain power .\n`` You ca n't say because they have n't done something they 're not going to do it , '' Clinton said . `` This is not only a terrorist syndicate , it is a criminal enterprise . So make no mistake about it , we 've got to have a better strategy . ''\nWhile their tone was generally respectful , several Republican senators made clear they were unsatisfied with Clinton 's answers .\nSen. John McCain , R-Arizona , one of the administration 's toughest critics since the Benghazi attack , took Clinton to task for what he considered lackluster attention to the growing threat in Benghazi .\nMcCain wanted to know why Clinton had n't read a cable from Ambassador Christopher Stevens warning that the mission in Benghazi could not survive a sustained assault .\nSen. Rand Paul said it would have been an offense worthy of firing Clinton had he been president .\nMcCain also blasted Clinton 's answers to questions about the administration 's claim that a protest had taken place in Benghazi .\n`` The American people deserve to know answers , and they certainly do n't deserve false answers , '' McCain told Clinton .\nClinton was more diplomatic with her old friend , saying she respected his strong feelings for the incident given his own relationship with Stevens , but that they disagreed about what happened and when it happened with respect to explaining events .\nIn addition to lessons the State Department learned about improving security at diplomatic posts , Clinton , who called the Benghazi attack an act of terrorism since Day One , suggested the administration might learn another lesson .\n`` Just withhold . Do n't say what you do n't know for sure until it 's finally decided . ''",
