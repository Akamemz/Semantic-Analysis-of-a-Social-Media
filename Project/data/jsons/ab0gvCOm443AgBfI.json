    "content": "Earlier this week , a respected Argentinian TV journalist reported that President-Elect Donald Trump had not only spoken with Argentinian president Mauricio Macri , but had specifically inquired about a stalled building permit for one of his real-estate projects in Buenos Aires . The camps for both Trump and Macri furiously denied that Trump had brought up the Torre Trump development and said that the conversation was merely a courtesy call from one head of state to another . The denials effectively neutered the story until Wednesday , when it was further reported that Trump \u2019 s real-estate project had , in fact , secured the long-delayed building permits just three days after speaking with Macri on November 14 , according to Argentinian paper La Naci\u00f3n .\nWhile there has been no hard evidence that Trump pressured Macri to approve the project , Quartz notes that the call between the two , who have been occasional golfing buddies since the 1980s , had been arranged with the help of Trump \u2019 s Argentinian business associate . La Naci\u00f3n reported that Felipe Yaryura , whose firm YY Development is building Torre Trump in Buenos Aires , helped foreign minister Susana Malcorra get in touch with the president-elect \u2019 s son , Eric Trump , shortly after the election . ( Yaryura himself was present at the Hilton Hotel in Midtown the night that Trump was elected . )\nThe State Department normally organizes conversations between the president-elect and other heads of state , but Trump has so far handled most of his dealings with his soon-to-be peers personally , often including his children in the conversations . Last week , Ivanka Trump and her husband , Jared Kushner , now a top Trump administration adviser , sat in on his meeting with Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe , raising questions about the division between Donald Trump and his Trump Organization . Trump has pledged to hand over the family business to his children in an arrangement the billionaire has likened to a blind trust , but that will leave him with a full accounting of his global assets and easy access to its managers . All three of Trump \u2019 s children from his first marriage , Ivanka , Eric , and Donald Jr. , are also key members of his White House transition team .\nIn an interview Tuesday with The New York Times , Trump defended his conflicts of interest , noting that the president is largely unrestrained by law from engaging in business while in office . \u201c The law \u2019 s totally on my side , the president ca n't have a conflict of interest , \u201d he argued , following days of questioning over his international business ties . \u201c In theory I could run my business perfectly and then run the country perfectly , \u201d he said at another point . \u201c There \u2019 s never been a case like this . \u201d\nTrump , who has never released his tax returns , is technically correct . The president , unlike other federal employees , is exempt from having to divest from businesses and financial interests while in office . Only the Emoluments Clause , an until-recently obscure provision of the Constitution , prevents the president from accepting any \u201c present , emolument , office or title , of any kind whatever , from any king , prince or foreign state , \u201d unless agreed to by Congress . Which is perhaps why Trump allegedly saw it fitting to suggest to British politician Nigel Farage , after winning the presidency , that he would certainly prefer if the U.K. did not build an unsightly offshore wind farm nearby his Aberdeen golf club in Scotland . And , perhaps , why Ivanka , who is in charge of the Trump Organization \u2019 s global real-estate holdings , was reportedly on her father \u2019 s call with Mauricio Macri . Family is important , after all , to the president-elect . \u201c If it were up to some people , \u201d Trump told the Times on Tuesday , \u201c I would never , ever see my daughter Ivanka again. \u201d The public might settle for him keeping her off his conference calls , to start .",
