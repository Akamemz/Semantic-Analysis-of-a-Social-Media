The August report revealed that a secretive DEA unit passes the NSA information to agents in the field , including those from the Internal Revenue Service , the FBI and Homeland Security , with instructions to never disclose the original source , even in court . In most cases , the NSA tips involve drugs , money laundering and organized crime , not terrorism . Five Democrats in the Senate and three senior Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee submitted questions to Holder about the NSA-DEA relationship , joining two prominent Republicans who have expressed concerns .
