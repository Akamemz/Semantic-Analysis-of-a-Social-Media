    "content": "It 's true that everybody eats . Though the specifics of how and what we eat differ across cultures , countries , class status , and whatever else separates us , the fact that we all must feed ourselves is the foundation for an entire niche of food content . In shows like Anthony Bourdain 's Parts Unknown , Dave Chang 's Ugly Delicious , Andrew Zimmern 's What 's Eating America , and most recently , Padma Lakshmi 's new Hulu series Taste the Nation , food is relational ; as unlikely companions band together over the act of eating , food becomes a way to find commonality and an entry point to political discussions that would be otherwise hard to broach .\nThe brainchild of Lakshmi , who moved to the United States from India at the age of four , Taste the Nation has the stated premise of being a show about immigrants : from the Mexican American community in El Paso , Texas ; to the Gullah Geechee people of South Carolina ; to the Indian immigrants who 've created the Little India in Jackson Heights , Queens ; to the German descendents in Milwaukee ; to the Peruvian enclave of Paterson , New Jersey ; and more . Lakshmi talks to people from all these groups about why they eat what they do , and what stories food can tell about their communities .\nUltimately , the fact that everybody eats is mobilized to suggest that food is the great unifier : I eat tacos , and you eat tacos ; therefore , we can find common ground through our shared appreciation of tacos , no matter our points of division . The language of `` food unites us , '' as it 's sold in shows and stories like these , suggests that because we eat similarly , our beliefs must be more similar than we think . Through food , we are all American\u2014or at least , that 's the tale these shows want us to believe . But as nice as this idea is\u2014as much as it inspires a wholesome image of a communal American table\u2014who is this narrative meant for , and who does it ultimately serve ?\nPerhaps the most heavy-handed suggestion of food 's ability to unite comes in the first episode of Taste the Nation . Lakshmi sits with the owner of a restaurant in El Paso , Texas as Border Patrol helicopters circle overhead . His restaurant has long been staffed by workers who cross from Juarez daily , but he supports President Trump . Lakshmi refrains from pushing back too hard on his politics , which means that their conversation does n't go far past acknowledging how much the restaurant needs these workers and their food . Here , food operates not quite as a unifier , but as the crux of a business model dependent on the dynamic between the United States and Mexico .\nFood is complicated ; Taste the Nation acknowledges that , but through stories like this one , with the owner 's dissonance between his restaurant 's operations and his conservative ideology , the show suggests that the food these workers make somehow transcends personal and political lines , especially as it 's eaten by white locals . An optimist could see this as proof that food allows disparate groups to understand each other , but as Jenny Zhang wrote in Eater , even the owner 's resistance to changing his views despite his years of employing Mexican workers undercuts the buoyant promises of `` breaking bread . ''\nShows like Taste the Nation , which use food to go deeper into migration , colonization , and assimilation , prompt people to think more deeply about the ways our cultural histories shape what we eat . Still , every idea that challenges the norms of white American culture is couched within the easy notion that food cuts through it all , and that through food , we can transcend these issues . Via the act of consuming , it implies , white Americans can better themselves .\n`` The ability to cook diverse food , to eat food from different places and cultures , is too often described as an enlightenment project , as a way to 'becoming ' something else , '' Eric Ritskes has written on his blog Anise to Za'atar . `` It is seen as a way to become more attuned to diverse ways of being , to even become less racist , more understanding , a better person , to dismantle biases , or to be less xenophobic . '' Ritskes ' framework relies on what author bell hooks put forth in `` Eating the Other , '' and , as hooks wrote , people within mainstream white culture can step out of it without changing the status quo .\nAs it 's said over and over again , `` food unites us '' becomes a self-congratulatory aphorism that does n't prompt white Americans to do anything particularly challenging . There 's a performative emptiness in the idea as we think of who is being united with whom , and why those divisions exist in the first place . These stories provide a platform for the immigrant experience , but the effects of the white American gaze are clear , as food becomes a means for validating lives that look unfamiliar .\nIn Taste the Nation and Ugly Delicious , the show 's hosts are people of color , and the stories they choose to amplify are guided by their experiences in the United States . As these stories are packaged for broader markets , the focus returns to white American validation as setting the standard , and reinforces the notion that our goals as `` others '' should be to prove our similarities . The conversation about the politics of food remains focused on the lowest common denominator .\nAt its heart , the call to action of the `` food unites us '' rhetoric is based on the exchange of goods as people consume foods outside their culture . That exchange benefits existing and unequal systems , as immigrants are valued through the ways their labor or cultural products enrich the lives of others . But our personal affinities for certain foods are not meaningful indicators that we revere or respect the people and cultures that created them . As food writer Alicia Kennedy has commented : `` I should be able to fuckin \u2019 hate burritos ( I do not ) and still recognize everyone \u2019 s humanity , every person \u2019 s intrinsic worth and dignity . ''\nThis tale coddles people in positions of power into thinking that the basic urge to consume is enough\u2014that buying a taco and loving it is a meaningful step toward racial justice or equity . A similar story has played out in the recent push toward supporting Black-owned restaurants . ( MUNCHIES has promoted such a list . ) Given the circumstances of the current political uprising , `` what relief does this transaction actually bring ? '' the writer Ruth Gebreyesus has asked . `` At best , it scratches the itch of ego-driven guilt . ''\nThe intentions of creators like Lakshmi are lofty and hopeful , but as we repeatedly ask white Americans to see that Black people , immigrants , and other marginalized groups are `` just like them , '' the conversation does n't move very far forward .

It 's dangerously naive to suggest that our shared appreciation for certain foods can bridge these massive structural gaps .\nYet the narrative that `` food unites us '' is one that purposely does not ruffle feathers .

Humanity\u2014as immigrants , as people of color , as whatever group needs to prove our worth\u2014should exist regardless of what foods we bring to the table ; it 's our humanity that unites us , with our food and the flavor it brings serving as a pleasant addition .\nThat narrative is n't as easy to swallow , though , because it requires us all to do more than simply buy and eat .",
