    "content": "The Obama and Romney campaigns cranked up their fight Sunday over claims that the Republican presidential candidate 's former company helped fuel a wave of outsourcing and off-shoring that sent U.S. jobs overseas .\nThe Obama campaign had already latched onto the narrative that Romney 's Bain Capital contributed to the country 's outsourcing shift , but a Washington Post story Friday on that very topic has since been employed as a bludgeon by team Obama .\nAfter releasing a web video and hosting a conference call Friday -- highlighting the story and accusing Romney of shipping jobs overseas -- the campaign pushed out another video Sunday declaring : `` America does n't need an outsourcing pioneer in the Oval Office . ''\nBut the Romney campaign is fighting back , noting that the Washington Post 's resident fact-checker challenged some of the claims in the Washington Post 's own story . Plus Romney advisers claim the Post -- and the Obama campaign -- are exaggerating what Bain Capital actually did .\n`` No American jobs were shipped overseas in any of the Washington Post examples that were cited by the Obama campaign , '' Romney adviser Eric Fehrnstrom said on CBS ' `` Face the Nation '' Sunday .\nMore On This ... Romney revs up money machine in Park City weekend\nUnder a headline that declared , `` Romney 's Bain Capital invested in companies that moved jobs overseas , '' the Post detailed how Bain had invested in certain companies that provided outsourcing services like call centers . It also detailed how Bain went into business with companies that produced products overseas .\nOutsourcing , in which services like customer service are taken out-of-house , and off-shoring , in which jobs are sent overseas , are two different things . The Post story , the Romney camp suggests , conflated the two .\n`` There were companies that Bain invested in that did engage in outsourcing , a lot of companies do , obviously . That 's an economic model that makes sense , '' Romney adviser Ed Gillespie said on CNN 's `` State of the Union , '' decrying the story as `` baseless . ''\nThe Romney campaign also complains that going into business with a company that creates jobs overseas is not the same as going into business with a company that moves U.S. jobs overseas .\n`` The jobs that were cited ... were created to support exports overseas , '' Fehrnstrom said .\n`` When companies like Coca-Cola , for example , build a bottling plant in China so they can sell more soft drinks to the Chinese , we should be applauding that , because that type of entrance into new markets is what makes our companies stronger . ''\nStephanie Cutter , deputy Obama campaign manager , questioned the claim on the same program .\n`` Are you really saying that in none of the dozens of Bain deals that Mitt Romney was involved in , not one American job got sent overseas ? '' she asked .\nAnd in what by any standard was a stretch , she asserted that Romney `` actually created the practice of outsourcing American jobs overseas to places like China and India . ''\nThe Romney campaign also drew attention Sunday to a fact-check column from The Washington Post itself , which was published shortly before the Post 's outsourcing article ran .\nThat column debunked an earlier Obama ad that slammed Romney for shipping jobs overseas .\n`` Regarding the outsourcing claims , we have frowned on these before , '' the column said , noting that two of the companies in question were in business with Bain when Romney had stepped down to run the Olympics but had n't sold his shares .
