    "content": "Give Donald Trump credit where it 's due : He promised an irrational crackdown on immigrants , and he delivered it the first week of his administration .\nTrump began his presidential campaign with a speech in which he described most Mexican immigrants as rapists , drug dealers , and other criminals , adding that `` some , I assume , are good people . '' During his campaign , he repeatedly said that as president he would deport all 11 million people who live in the United States without the government 's permission .\nLast August , Trump signaled what he described as a `` softening '' of that position . `` We are not looking to hurt people , '' he told Sean Hannity on Fox News . `` We have some great people in this country . ''\nTrump suggested he was open to legalizing unauthorized immigrants , a policy supported by most Americans . If they `` pay back taxes , '' he said , he would be willing to `` work with them , '' although there would be `` no citizenship '' and `` no amnesty as such . ''\nLess than a week after he was elected president , Trump again indicated he did not plan to carry out the sort of mass deportation he had advocated during the campaign . `` After the border is secured and after everything gets normalized , '' he told Lesley Stahl on 60 Minutes , `` we 're going to make a determination on the people that you 're talking about , who are terrific people . ''\nAn executive order that Trump signed last week contradicts these assurances . The order instructs the Department of Homeland Security to `` prioritize for removal '' not only unauthorized residents who `` have been convicted of any criminal offense '' ( including misdemeanors and nonviolent drug offenses ) but also those who `` have committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense '' ( meaning a conviction is not required ) and those who `` have engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency . ''\nThat last category includes anyone who has falsely claimed to be a legal resident on an official form or used a fake Social Security number to obtain a job . For good measure , the order also approves removal of anyone else whom an immigration officer deems `` a risk to public safety or national security . ''\nThe order thus lays the ground for ejecting virtually all illegal residents , regardless of how long they have lived in the United States , how peaceful and productive they have been , or how much they have paid in taxes . Trump seems bent on deporting millions of `` terrific people . ''\nAnother immigration-related executive order that Trump signed last week suspended admission of all refugees for 120 days , blocked Syrian refugees indefinitely , cut this year 's refugee cap in half , and banned travelers with passports from any of seven Muslim-majority countries for 90 days . It fell short of Trump 's 2015 recommendation urging `` a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country 's representatives can figure out what is going on .
