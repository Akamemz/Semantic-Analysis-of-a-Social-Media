    "content": "The New York Times published an embarrassing look at what went on behind the scenes during the long , long months of \u201c nuclear negotiations \u201d with Iran . Apparently , it involved a good deal of Iran shouting at the hapless U.S. team and declaring its demands non-negotiable , while Team Obama threw in one towel after another .\nOne by one , the roadblocks to a nuclear accord between Iran and the United States had been painstakingly cleared . But as the negotiations went into their third week in the neoclassical Coburg Palace hotel this month , a major dispute lingered over whether a ban on Iran \u2019 s ability to purchase conventional weapons and missile technology would remain in place . The American delegation , led by Secretary of State John Kerry , insisted on extending the ban . But Mohammad Javad Zarif , the Iranian foreign minister and his country \u2019 s chief negotiator , was opposed . Backing him were the Russians and Chinese , equal parties in the talks , who saw a lucrative market in selling arms to Tehran . A compromise was struck that fully satisfied neither side : a five-year ban on the sale of conventional weapons and an eight-year ban on ballistic missiles .\nThe Iranians are still slapping Obama around because they are emboldened , not because they are unsatisfied . They got everything they wanted \u2014 there is not a single red line drawn by Obama over the years they did not cross \u2014 and now they have more leverage than ever , because they know Obama \u2019 s humiliation from letting the deal die would be worse than ever , so they are still announcing highly creative interpretations of key points in the bargain .\nWe are also still discovering details about this alleged mutual capitulation , too . For example , we just learned American nuclear inspectors are banned from Iran under the deal . We have to help them provide security for their nuclear operations , but we can \u2019 t inspect them .\nRight after telling its liberal readership that fairy tale , the Times dishes a bit more about what was really going on :\nPrivately , Mr. Kerry told his team that any lifting of the ban was bound to inflame many in Congress , where fears of empowering Iran would mix with presidential politics . But shortly before midnight on Monday he called President Obama , and together they agreed that it was not worth losing what they saw as the best chance to roll back Iran \u2019 s nuclear program simply because there was a risk that sometime in the future Iran would be able to acquire far less dangerous weapons . Over the 17 long days here in Vienna , the standoffs , trade-offs , shouts and confrontations \u2014 some real , some staged for negotiating advantage \u2014 sometimes obscured the fact that the two countries were negotiating with entirely different agendas . As Mr. Obama made clear again Wednesday , the alternative he saw to the deal was a steady slide toward another war \u2014 perhaps , aides thought , in just a year or two as Iran \u2019 s nuclear abilities accelerated . Throughout the talks , he had one goal : to diminish the prospect that Iran could develop an atomic bomb \u2014 or could race for one before the United States and its allies could react \u2014 and buy time to try to restructure the relationship . For the president , everything else \u2014 Iran \u2019 s support for terrorism , its imprisonment of dissidents and even some Americans , its meddling in Iraq and Syria , its arms trade \u2014 was secondary .\nNone of that is news to anyone , least of all the Iranians . They understood all along that their bargaining position was superior , because Obama needed a deal at any cost \u2014 as his critics have said all along , he would take a bad deal over no deal , especially as he got deeper into the process , and it became more obvious that both Obama \u2019 s ego and political needs made backing away from the table unthinkable . Obama and Kerry doubled down with every losing hand , until the Iranians cleaned them out .\nThe NYT is essentially saying that Obama \u2019 s top priority was collecting some good press and personal accolades for a deal , and dumping the Iran problem into someone else \u2019 s lap while he gets through his lame-duck years .\nLate in the article , it is mentioned that Obama grew embarrassed about how obvious his thirst for a deal had become , and tried telling his aides , \u201c I don \u2019 t need this. \u201d The aides guessed that he meant Supreme Court wins on ObamaCare and gay marriage had given him enough political cover to make delaying the Iran deal feasible .\nOne way to appreciate how badly America lost in this lousy deal is to look at how many side issues it does include \u2013 every last one of them a win for Iran . \u201c Imprisonment of dissidents and even some Americans \u201d does not directly relate to nuclear weapons\u2026 but neither does ICBM technology , and Iran won concessions there .\nObama \u2019 s apologists are spinning this debacle by claiming the only alternative was a huge , bloody war , beginning immediately .
