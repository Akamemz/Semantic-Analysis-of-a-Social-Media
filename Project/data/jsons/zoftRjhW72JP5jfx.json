Settled in among the hardwood trees on Peters Mountain , near where another ( pseudonymous ) activist known as Nutty has been occupying an aerial platform , he talks of his family \u2019 s 150-plus years in Giles County , Virginia , and how that history motivates him to do all he can to prevent the pipeline from crossing the Appalachian Trail .\nNow in 2020 , the Peters Mountain blockade no longer exists , and although many tree sits have fizzled out , a group of up to a dozen activists have been camped in a steep hollow along Yellow Finch Lane near Elliston , Virginia , for nearly a year and a half . ( Hale lives nearby and visits the encampment several times each week . ) It is at least partly to their credit that the Mountain Valley Pipeline remains unfinished . Its production cost has risen from a projected $ 3.5 billion to $ 5.5 billion , and the pipeline is two years behind its original timeline due to a series of regulations and litigation preventing it from crossing the Appalachian Trail and multiple rivers and waterways .\nYellow Finch , as the encampment has come to be called , is giving its full-time activists , most of whom are in their 20s , an on-the-ground education in Appalachian direct action . They \u2019 re learning how to talk to media , to establish and maintain a defensible blockade in the forest , and to survive a winter in the mountains , all in a region written off by much of the US as \u201c Trump country. \u201d Less explored is the region \u2019 s significant history of activism that brought together outsiders and locals to resist corporate exploitation , from the labor organizing by Mary Harris \u201c Mother \u201d Jones on behalf of West Virginia miners in the 1910s and \u2019 20s , to the Mountain Justice campaign against mountaintop removal coal mining a century later . Some veterans of the latter campaign are now working with the folks at Yellow Finch , applying lessons learned in the current fight against fossil fuels .\nThe camp lies at the base of the steep Blue Ridge Plateau ; to reach it , you must drive carefully up a twisting mountain backroad and then back down a dirt road that follows a stream . Steep slopes rise up on either side , and the contrast between sides of the hollow stand as a testament to the activists \u2019 success in delaying pipeline construction . On one side , the forest has been stripped bare , replanted with grass , and shored up with silt fences and green , mulch-stuffed fabric socks to prevent erosion . The other side of the hollow , home to the Yellow Finch encampment , remains wooded .\nThe camp is set about 50 yards up from the road , firmly planted into the hillside . A couple of hastily erected plywood buildings covered in handmade art and cardboard signs serve as a sleeping area and pantry . Tarps nailed to the side of the bunkhouse and nearby trees cover a makeshift kitchen , scattered with dishes , cooking gear , herbal tinctures , nutritional yeast , and other supplies .\nThe number of activists that call the camp home fluctuates with the weather and the need for additional people to sustain the camp . A 27-year-old activist called Gator fondly describes the camp \u2019 s occupants as \u201c a bunch of badass queer anarchists that held it down for a long period of time. \u201d They come from all over and vary in age , ethnicity , socioeconomic status , and family backgrounds , but they \u2019 re united in their desire to protect the mountains . They found the camp through a variety of paths ; several cut their teeth in other movements , organizing against the mining of frac sand , the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , mass incarceration , and police violence . They discovered Yellow Finch through word of mouth , on news sites popular with anarchists like It \u2019 s Going Down and Unicorn Riot , and Appalachians Against Pipelines , the campaign \u2019 s quasi-official Facebook page . Several came after seeing the video that featured Hale .\nOne of the camp mainstays is known as Dustie Pinesap . She grew up in the Midwest , then trained in tree-climbing and forest defense in 2017 and 2018 against Pennsylvania \u2019 s Mariner East pipeline system before coming to Yellow Finch . \u201c You don \u2019 t need to be able to climb a tree , \u201d Pinesap said . \u201c You can cook food . You can bring supplies . You can build structures . You can chop wood . There \u2019 s a lot of things to do . \u201d\nPinesap recalls how poorly prepared Yellow Finch was for its first winter , but how MVP \u2019 s rival camp was even worse . Pinesap remembers security guards clad in cotton uniforms , shivering and staring at their phones in a tent heated with propane\u2014what she called a \u201c carbon monoxide special . \u201d\n\u201c They \u2019 re out of their element and they don \u2019 t really know what to do , \u201d Pinesap says . \u201c We \u2019 ve got a fire here , we can cook over a fire . We fill in the shack and warm up by the woodstove . We \u2019 re chopping wood , we \u2019 re doing things , we \u2019 re being active . They [ pipeline security ] are sitting around like you would at an office job . \u201d\nPart of the power in the activists \u2019 mission comes from the community support they have managed to garner . Though Hale and another local supporter , Crystal Mello , don \u2019 t live in the protest camp , they offer up their homes for the Yellow Finch folks to take showers and do laundry ; they haul socks , toilet paper , food , and other supplies up the mountain each week . The broader population in communities along MVP \u2019 s route tolerate Yellow Finch and the broader anti-pipeline campaign ; many support their efforts outright . Handmade anti-pipeline signs appear along the roads near the pipeline , while visible pro-pipeline sentiment is non-existent . The biggest problem , Mello says , is a sense of fatalism that pervades the community : \u201c Nobody likes this pipeline , but everybody says , \u2019 It \u2019 s stupid , but what are you going to do , it \u2019 s coming anyway. \u2019 It \u2019 s the saddest conversation . \u201d\nMello , who became fast friends with Hale upon meeting him at the encampment , monitors law enforcement vehicles on the road to the camp with the help of a network of other locals . If any are spotted , she heads out to the Yellow Finch site to try and defuse the situation or , in case of arrest , provide jail and court support .\nThey make an odd pair . Mello , a 44-year-old single mother and grandmother , earns a living cleaning houses and emphasizes her local roots by wearing clothes bearing logos for the nearby high school and community events like the Eastmont Tomato Festival . At camp , she often takes the \u201c gate \u201d chore\u2014a boring but essential job monitoring who approaches the camp\u2014and she even spent a few days in one of the tree sits . Hale is one of the rare white cis men among a group comprised of mostly gender nonbinary activists . Both Hale and Mello feel fiercely protective of the younger camp activists ; Mello compares them to her kids \u2019 friends , while Hale has at different times jawed with pipeline security and scuffled with a state trooper for picking on the protesters , earning misdemeanor assault and disorderly conduct charges . He was found not guilty of the first , but convicted and sentenced to 30 days on the second . ( He has appealed the ruling . )\nStill , Hale says he \u2019 s learning a lot from the pipeline fighters about white supremacy and gender politics . He \u2019 s learned about violence against transgender individuals , women , and people of color . They \u2019 ve broadened his worldview . \u201c I \u2019 ve always been kind of a hermit , \u201d Hale said . \u201c I took care of myself and my family and liked to be left alone . Through this journey , I \u2019 ve had to step out of so many boxes . I \u2019 ve had to step outside of my comfort zone , like with pronouns . I never thought it was that important , but to some folks , it is . I \u2019 ve become more sensitive to folks. \u201d In return , he shares his homesteading skills .\n\u201c Me being a mountain person , I hoped I \u2019 ve shared how to stay warm , how to stay dry , how to prepare water , \u201d Hale said . \u201c I hope these folks have learned from me , but I \u2019 ve learned way more from them . Before I started this , it was all about me . It was all about my farm and my family , and not about anyone else . But after I met these young folks living in the woods and coming up with random acts of kindness , it \u2019 s really touched my heart and opened me up . \u201d\nBefore he got involved in the Peters Mountain blockades documented by Unicorn Riot , Hale worked as a janitor at a state university until he tore the muscles in his back and shoulders while on the job . Hale sued and won early retirement . Since then , he had focused on keeping up his farm , caring for cattle , goats , pigs , and chickens . Fishing and hunting were his main pastimes . \u201c I never was political until I started this journey , \u201d Hale said .\nThat journey began when he spotted a pipeline crew surveying land on his neighbor \u2019 s farm . Hale had been charged with watching the property while his neighbor was out of town ; he reported the trespassers to the police . When a local deputy declined to arrest them , Hale was furious . He connected with other pipeline activists on Facebook and learned about the Peters Mountain tree sits on the news ; in February , he received a text from another local about Nutty \u2019 s aerial pod . Hale spent 52 days at Nutty \u2019 s support camp before joining up with jail and court support for activists who are arrested , and he began visiting Yellow Finch a few times each week .\nIn the Unicorn Riot video , Hale talks about what he \u2019 s going to do next : \u201c I \u2019 ve seen Mountain Valley pipeline stocks go down , and that \u2019 s where my target is .
