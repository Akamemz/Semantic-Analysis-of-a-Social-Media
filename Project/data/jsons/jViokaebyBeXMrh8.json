The immigration issue also offers the president a chance to change the subject away from the troubled rollout of his health law . The only other legislative initiative on his plate , a proposed increase in the minimum wage , has no chance of passing Congress and serves more as a rallying point for Democrats .\nAfter last week 's immigration meeting with business leaders , one corporation represented , McDonald 's Corp. , decided to enlist its franchise owners to lobby members of Congress on the issue , two people familiar with the company 's plans said .
