    "content": "The Obama administration , under massive pressure from both sides of the culture war over contraception , has decided to appeal a federal court \u2019 s order to make a morning-after pill available to everyone without a prescription , just a day after expanding access to the pills for younger teenage girls .\nOn Wednesday evening , Justice Department officials said they had filed the appeal with the 2nd U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals and also asked a district court to put on hold the early April ruling by Judge Edward Korman of New York that the administration must make Plan B One-Step available without restrictions .\nIn filing notice with the appeals court , Justice said Judge Korman exceeded his authority in ordering that Plan B and a generic equivalent must be sold to everybody like aspirin by May 5 .\n\u201c The public interest will not be served by reclassification of drugs as non-prescription by order of a court , without appropriate agency decision-making procedures being followed , \u201d U.S. Attorney Loretta E. Lynch said in a letter to Judge Korman , noting that the government wants to \u201c prevent public uncertainty regarding the status of the drugs at issue . \u201d\n\u201c Moreover , if the status of these drugs is changed and later reversed , it can lead to situations in which women mistakenly believe that they can obtain the drug without a prescription or at certain locations where it used to be , but is no longer , available , \u201d Ms. Lynch wrote . \u201c Depending on the outcome of the appeal , the problem would be exacerbated because products with incorrect labeling will presumably remain on pharmacy shelves . \u201d\nThe appeal was filed one day after the Food and Drug Administration moved to let girls as young as 15 obtain Plan B One-Step , one of the three types of emergency contraception , without a prescription .
