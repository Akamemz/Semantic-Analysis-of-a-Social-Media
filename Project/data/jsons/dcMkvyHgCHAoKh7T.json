    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) As President Donald Trump announced in the Rose Garden on Friday that his quixotic bid to secure more than $ 5 billion for a border wall would end with no money , he was met with applause from his Cabinet secretaries and senior aides .\nInstead of emerging victorious , many of Trump 's allies are walking away from a record-breaking government shutdown feeling outplayed , not least by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi . The President is now more unpopular than he was before the shutdown began , sacked with blame for the 35-day lapse in funding .\nFriday 's announcement was an extraordinary comedown that left many in the White House and those who support Trump marveling at the futility of the preceding four weeks of brinkmanship . In the eyes of some aides and outside advisers , an entire fruitless month has passed that can not be recouped , a waste of the most valuable asset a White House has : the President 's attention and time .\n`` A humiliating loss for a man that rarely loses , '' one Trump adviser said . `` I miss winning . ''\nPictures on Friday of delayed aircraft at LaGuardia Airport in his hometown \u2014 the same tarmac Trump 's black , red and gold Boeing 757 is usually staged \u2014 sealed what had been a days-long realization that the shutdown must end , according to officials .\nThe previous evening , Trump heard from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in a phone call that Republicans could no longer hold the line in support of his border wall demands . Trump , who was briefed by aides of looming law enforcement and airport problems , later phoned McConnell back to tell him he was ready to end the stalemate .\nTop advisers , including Trump 's son-in-law Jared Kushner and Vice President Mike Pence , presented him with options , including insisting upon a `` prorated '' amount of border wall money included in a three-week stopgap funding measure , or declaring a national emergency .\nThose were both ideas Trump appeared initially to endorse . On Thursday from the Cabinet Room he repeatedly mentioned `` alternate '' ways of funding the wall and offered support for `` prorated '' wall money . But Kushner and other aides warned a national emergency would prompt legal challenges and not lead to immediate wall construction . And when Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer balked at a wall `` down payment , '' it became clear that only a bill with zero border funding would muster enough support for passage .\nTrump remains hopeful that some moderate Democrats will join him in supporting funding for a border wall after the funding measure expires in mid-February . Administration officials say he would be willing to accept less than the $ 5.7 billion he has insisted upon in an attempt to strike an accord .\nAcknowledging a new political reality with Pelosi in charge , one adviser said the only way forward for Trump is `` compromise , '' with little room for the no-holds-barred approach favored by advisers like Stephen Miller , the immigration hardliner .\n`` Today is not a cave but a grave for Stephen Miller policies , '' the adviser said , acknowledging it 's not clear at all that Trump is ready to make that kind of course correction .\nDuring most of the shutdown , Trump remained singularly focused on the wall , declining to travel much and declaring at regular intervals that he was alone in the White House , waiting to negotiate .
