With her announcement , she joins trailblazers including Shirley Chisholm and Carol Moseley Braun , two African-American women who previously vied for the Democratic ticket .\nHarris noted that she would bring a wide-ranging set of qualifications to the position , when GMA \u2019 s Robin Roberts pressed her about fellow California Sen. Dianne Feinstein \u2019 s support of former Vice President Joe Biden . Harris said that Feinstein and Biden have a \u201c longstanding \u201d relationship , which she respects .\n\u201c I have the unique experience of having been a leader in local government , state government , and federal government , \u201d she said regarding her credentials . \u201c The American public wants a fighter ... and I \u2019 m prepared to do that . \u201d\nHarris , 54 , plans to launch her campaign during a rally in Oakland , California , on January 27 . She \u2019 s expected to highlight her time as a state attorney general and her work on criminal justice and immigration reform as key tenets of the campaign , all centered on the core theme \u201c For the People . \u201d\nHarris has a long record of public service . She served as California attorney general and San Francisco district attorney for a combined 12 years before she was elected to the Senate in 2016 . As only the second African-American woman to serve in the Senate , she \u2019 s emerged as a prominent champion for racial equality , though some have questioned her past approach to criminal justice .\nBuzz about Harris \u2019 s potential presidential run has been building ever since she was elected to the Senate : Her legal chops , telegenic appeal , and barrier-breaking track record have made her a social media darling . According to a recent analysis published by Axios , Harris far and away leads the 2020 pack when it comes to Twitter engagement .\nCan you think of any laws that give the government the power to make decisions about the male body ? pic.twitter.com/lDcXPZ56hX \u2014 Kamala Harris ( @ SenKamalaHarris ) September 6 , 2018\nDuring her time in the Senate , Harris has also impressed a crucial contingent of immigration advocates , many of whom have praised her willingness to stake out an unflinchingly aggressive opposition to the White House . She was the first senator to say that she wouldn \u2019 t vote for a spending package if Congress didn \u2019 t enshrine protections for DREAMers and before that spent time as attorney general confronting the child migrant crisis . She was also the first to call for Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to resign in the wake of the Trump administration \u2019 s implementation of family separation immigration policies .\n\u201c The government should be in the business of keeping families together , not tearing them apart , \u201d she said at the time .\nAcross other issue areas , Harris has backed now-standard lefty policies within the Democratic party , from Medicare-for-all to marijuana legalization .\nShe has taken some hits on her prosecutorial past , however . While she \u2019 s championed reforms and likes to describe herself as a \u201c progressive prosecutor , \u201d she \u2019 s bound to face scrutiny for her record on criminal justice , which has been criticized for its seemingly conflicting approaches to issues including the death penalty and incarceration .\nShe touched on the issue during the GMA appearance . \u201c It is a false choice to suggest that communities don \u2019 t want law enforcement . Most communities do . They don \u2019 t want excessive force , they don \u2019 t want racial profiling , \u201d she said . \u201c People want to know that their law enforcement is going to conduct themselves without a system of bias . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s one key subject Harris will likely have to reckon with as competition intensifies in the Democratic field . So far , however , her candidacy is off to a strong start . She \u2019 s been in the top tier of early Democratic primary polling and has already made recent trips to Iowa and South Carolina .\nBorn in Oakland to Indian and Jamaican immigrants , Harris is a groundbreaking candidate by all measures . She was the first African-American woman to become California attorney general , the first African-American senator California has ever elected , and the second African-American woman to sit on the Senate \u2019 s powerful Judiciary Committee .\nAs her star has risen , she \u2019 s also made it a point to advise and promote other candidates of color , including women and first-time candidates , New York magazine reports . \u201c My mother used to tell me , \u2018 Kamala , you may be the first to do many things . Make sure you are not the last , \u2019 \u201d she said . During the 2018 elections , Harris offered counsel and endorsements to several successful Democrats including Jahana Hayes , London Breed , and Lucy McBath .\nWhile she \u2019 s served in the Senate , Harris has also been at the forefront of efforts to address racial discrimination , slamming now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh for using racist dog whistles in a past op-ed and opposing other judicial nominees like Thomas Farr because of his past ties to voter suppression efforts . Harris has repeatedly emphasized that such fights are not only important but exceedingly personal .\n\u201c Almost two decades after the Supreme Court \u2019 s landmark ruling in Brown v.

She has introduced multiple bills targeting the treatment of migrant children and families by border patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement .\nHarris \u2019 s history on criminal justice has prompted questions about her progressive bona fides\nMuch of the scrutiny on Harris has centered on the time she spent as a prosecutor in California , with many progressives wondering how exactly certain \u201c smart on crime \u201d stances align with her current policy positions .\nIt \u2019 s a record that \u2019 s filled with apparent contradictions , which speaks to a balancing act she \u2019 s had to strike over the years .\nShe pushed for programs that helped people find jobs instead of putting them in prison , but also fought to keep people in prison in certain cases that included evidence of wrongful conviction . She refused to pursue the death penalty against a man who killed a police officer ( and personally opposes the penalty ) , but also defended California \u2019 s death penalty system in court . She implemented training programs to address police officers \u2019 racial biases but also resisted calls to get her office to investigate individual police shootings .\nHer supporters acknowledge her shortcomings but also say she \u2019 s fought for key reforms that were often ahead of the rest of the country .\n\u201c Kamala Harris has spent her career fighting for reforms in the criminal justice system and pushing the envelope to keep everyone safer by bringing fairness and accountability , \u201d Lily Adams , a spokesperson for Harris , said .\nHarris \u2019 s website , meanwhile , notes that her work as California attorney general was integral to defending the Affordable Care Act , advancing marriage equality , and obtaining a $ 20 billion settlement that helped state residents who were hurt by foreclosures during the financial crisis .\nBut even this could be treacherous territory in a party renewing its attention to economic populism ; a piece by Phil Wilton in the Los Angeles Times had a more critical reading of her response to the mortgage lenders , noting that it fell short of some of Harris \u2019 s earlier promises including sending the bankers responsible to jail . And a piece in Jacobin , a publication that characterizes itself as a \u201c leading voice of the American left , \u201d took Harris to task for how it ultimately left some with underwater mortgages with little actual financial relief .\nHarris has noted that the $ 20 billion she ultimately secured was widely heralded as a win \u2014 and a huge increase from the $ 2 billion to $ 4 billion figure the banks originally wanted to settle for \u2014 even though it didn \u2019 t ultimately provide as much of a safety net as it could have for some homeowners . \u201c There were homeowners that were , at that moment and each day , holding on by the fingernails trying to keep their homes , \u201d Harris said at the time , noting that this urgency drove her approach to negotiations .\nWhile Harris has established one of the most liberal voting records as a senator , she \u2019 ll likely face critiques about her prosecutorial record as the campaign gets underway .
