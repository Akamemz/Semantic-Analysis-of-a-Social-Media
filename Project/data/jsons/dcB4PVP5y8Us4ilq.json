In 1997 , he joined the US attorney \u2019 s office for the northern district of Georgia as a federal prosecutor before joining the leadership ranks at the justice department in 2001 , months before the September 11 attacks would reshape law enforcement response to terrorism .\nAccording to his biography , Wray played an pivotal role in the department \u2019 s response to the 9/11 attacks , overseeing legal and operational actions in the continuing war on terrorism . He also served as a member of the Bush administration \u2019 s corporate fraud taskforce and led the fraud investigation of Enron Corp .\nWray graduated from Yale University in 1989 and Yale Law School in 1992 , where he served as executive director of the Yale Law Journal .\nTrump \u2019 s announcement took lawmakers in Washington by surprise .
