    "content": "A growing number of Democrats considering a presidential bid have signaled support for the sweeping `` Green New Deal '' pushed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other liberal lawmakers , underscoring how the 2020 field is being pulled further left by the influential progressive wing .\nAn analysis by Fox News shows at least eight potential Democratic candidates have voiced support for or touted aspects of the proposal , which amounts to a drastic overhaul of the U.S. economy and government benefit system .\nRep. Eric Swalwell , D-Calif. , 37 , who says he is looking at a 2020 presidential run , told Fox News he was \u201c excited \u201d to support the proposal and be a part of the process .\n\u201c When it comes to climate change , we need to advance policies that don \u2019 t ask Americans to choose between their jobs and clean air and water , \u201d Swalwell told Fox News this week . \u201c We can do that by greening the grid with investments in renewable energy and a wage and skills guarantee for any displaced worker . \u201d\nHe added : \u201c It \u2019 s time to go big on this issue with bold solutions . I welcome a Green New Deal and am excited to offer additional ideas to create meaningful jobs and address the crisis of climate change . \u201d\nHigher-profile potential candidates ranging from Sen. Elizabeth Warren to Sen. Cory Booker also have voiced support .\nFox News reached out to nearly two-dozen Democrats seen as potential 2020 candidates to ask about their position on the Green New Deal . Some voiced support for the plan or pointed Fox News to prior statements of support , though most did not respond to the requests for comment or declined to comment -- leaving open the possibility that more potential candidates could lend their support in the coming weeks .\nThe expansive Green New Deal proposal has floated in Democratic circles for years but was given new life by the Sunrise Movement and liberal lawmakers like Ocasio-Cortez . The package would focus on income inequality and climate change , combining ideas incorporated in former President Franklin D. Roosevelt \u2019 s signature New Deal , and modern ideas like renewable energy and resource efficiency .\nA draft text of the plan has circulated around Congress and laid out a framework that includes eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and agriculture and \u201c dramatically \u201d expanding energy sources to meet 100 percent of power demand through renewable sources . The proposal describes this as a \u201c historic opportunity to virtually eliminate poverty in the United States and to make prosperity , wealth and economic security available to everyone participating in the transformation . \u201d\nAnd it includes a host of other liberal wish-list items like : a job-guarantee program offering a \u201c living wage job to every person who wants one ; \u201d a \u201c just transition \u201d for workers affected by climate change ; basic income programs ; universal health care and more .\nThe proposal already has garnered support from dozens of House Democrats , though it 's unclear how far Democratic leadership in the chamber is willing to take the idea . But at least as a political talking point , it 's beginning to take off in the field of hopefuls eyeing a challenge to President Trump .\nSen. Booker , D-N.J. , issued his endorsement for the proposal last month . When reached by Fox News , a spokesperson for Booker pointed to his December tweet on the matter .\n\u201c We must take bold action on climate change & create a green economy that benefits all Americans .

Warren , D-Mass. , who has already launched an exploratory committee for a 2020 run , \u201c supports the idea of a Green New Deal to ambitiously tackle our climate crisis , economic inequality , and racial injustice , \u201d a Warren aide told Axios earlier this month .\nSen. Bernie Sanders , I-Vt. , who has been on the leading edge in Congress pushing for universal health care and free college education , also offered his support for the plan , along with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard , D-Hawaii .\nSen. Jeff Merkley , D-Ore. , endorsed the proposal last month and said he would introduce his own version of a Green New Deal in 2019 .\n\u201c We absolutely have to make sure this is part of the conversation going into 2020 , \u201d Merkley told The Washington Post last month . \u201c Mother Nature is sending this message , and the youth have double down on the message . \u201d\nFormer Obama administration Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro , poised to make a 2020 announcement this weekend , will reportedly support the proposal , telling NBC News that `` we should do that , '' when asked about the plan .\nAnd Democratic darling Beto O \u2019 Rourke , who was narrowly defeated by Sen.
