Her water had broken five months early , during a prenatal procedure testing for abnormalities that went horribly wrong .\nHer doctors , at a Catholic hospital in southwestern Chicago , said there was nothing they could do . Ernst said they essentially told her \u201c the baby is going to be terribly deformed and probably won \u2019 t come to term , but you are just going to have to wait and be pregnant and give birth to a child that is either terribly deformed or ... \u201d\n\u201c I have a big issue with anybody that feels they get to legislate what I get to do with my body , \u201d she said . She ultimately went to a different hospital to have an abortion .\nHer congressman is Rep. Dan Lipinski , one of the last remaining anti-abortion Democrats in the House . He has voted to defund health clinics that offer abortion services , and to ban abortions at 20 weeks . He opposed the Affordable Care Act and its mandate that employers cover birth control . He speaks at the annual March for Life and attends fundraisers for anti-abortion groups .\nErnst supports Marie Newman , a progressive who supports abortion rights and is mounting a primary challenge to Lipinski . \u201c It just never felt [ Lipinski ] was a Democrat , \u201d Ernst , now 63 , said , sitting in a Chicago Ridge , Illinois , home where Newman was holding a meet-and-greet .\nThis will be one of the most competitive Democratic primaries in 2020 . And already , Newman is encountering some roadblocks . Though the district leans heavily Democratic , the national party has erected rules to protect incumbents like Lipinski . Newman says she can \u2019 t find a pollster who will work for her . Four political consultants have left her campaign because of a policy , made public in April , that the official campaign arm for House Democrats won \u2019 t do business with political vendors \u2014 like direct mail companies or political consultants \u2014 that also work for candidates challenging incumbent Democrats . Party superstars like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez oppose the rule ; she also managed to topple an incumbent in a primary challenge . But the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee isn \u2019 t budging .\nThe DCCC says it \u2019 s committed to incumbents , a loyalty to dues-paying members , that it believes represent the party \u2019 s best chance of keeping control in the House . And the DCCC \u2019 s chair , Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos , is a big proponent of \u201c big tent \u201d politics . Progressive lawmakers in Congress are still railing against what they see as a \u201c divisive \u201d policy that effectively \u201c blacklists \u201d groups and candidates .\nThe Democratic Party may need ideological diversity to regain national power , but already , Lipinski \u2019 s side of the \u201c big tent \u201d is looking sparse . Newman came within 2,200 votes of beating Lipinski in 2018 . She \u2019 s running again , already picking up endorsements from progressive groups like Emily \u2019 s List and NARAL , as well as from 2020 presidential candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders and Gov . Jay Inslee . In a year when Democrats are newly energized around abortion rights , the Democratic apparatus protecting an anti-abortion candidate in friendly territory is raising eyebrows .\nLipinski is one of the last anti-abortion Democrats in a liberal district\nDemocrats have tolerated some anti-abortion lawmakers in their coalition , but the numbers are dwindling in a party that \u2019 s adopted a pro-woman mantle . Only three sitting House Democrats regularly vote against abortion rights ; Lipinski ; Rep. Collin Peterson , who represents a conservative Minnesota district ; and Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar . Everyone else has moved on the issue or left . Even Joe Biden , the current frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination , recently revised his position , saying the ban on using federal funds for abortions , which he used to support , should be overturned .\nThe issue has taken on new urgency in the 2020 primaries as Republican state legislatures pass stricter abortion laws explicitly designed to be brought before an increasingly conservative Supreme Court and unravel Roe v. Wade . Bustos was pressured into canceling her fundraiser for Lipinski in light of the Alabama state law banning abortions at six weeks , without exceptions for rape and incest .\nBut in the liberal stronghold of Illinois \u2019 s Third Congressional District , the anti-abortion Lipinski family has been in power for nearly 40 years \u2014 first Lipinski \u2019 s father , William , held the seat before passing it on to Dan \u2014 and they \u2019 re fighting against the current .\nOnce known for its conservative pockets , the area \u2014 surrounding Midway Airport , which spans parts of Cook and Will counties \u2014 is more diverse both socioeconomically and politically than it once was . It \u2019 s younger and middle class ; the median age is 37 , with a $ 65,000 household income , according to the most recent census estimates . There \u2019 s a growing Latinx population . Sanders beat Hillary Clinton here in 2016 by 8 points . Clinton went on to beat Donald Trump by an even bigger margin . Interestingly , Lipinski , who was a superdelegate in the 2016 elections , pledged his vote to Sanders .\nBut between Newman and Lipinski , only one has adopted Sanders \u2019 s worldview .\n\u201c I \u2019 m a real Democrat , \u201d Newman likes to tell voters . \u201c To be a real Democrat , you have to believe in the platform , \u201d she said to \u2588\u2588\u2588 . She , like Sanders , identifies income inequality as the root cause of American suffering . At a Saturday morning Pet Parade in Chicago \u2019 s Garfield Ridge neighborhood , Newman led a procession of staffers and volunteers \u2014 and their dogs \u2014 with signs supporting Medicare-for-all , a $ 15 minimum wage , and a Green New Deal . Newman supports abortion rights , the Equality Act , and free college and thinks Immigration and Customs Enforcement should be \u201c repealed and replaced . \u201d\nSteps behind , Lipinski \u2019 s team , in T-shirts reading \u201c Commonsense Leadership for the 3rd District \u201d on the backs , represented a different world of Democratic politics . In Washington , Lipinski \u2019 s commonsense leadership has translated to a vote against the Affordable Care Act and a past opposition to raising the minimum wage to $ 15 hour ( he supported raising it to $ 12 but has since shifted on the issue ) . Lipinski voted for the Dream Act and the Equality Act for the first time this year , but with a caveat \u2014 he believes the bill conflicts with his positions on religious liberties . In the past , his immigration views have been more focused on border security than on a path to citizenship . ICE has continued to conduct raids in his district .\nWhen describing the area , Lipinski \u2019 s staff focuses on the district \u2019 s history of conservatism . Lipinski himself cites the influx of Latinx residents as the biggest change in his district .\nBut Newman and her supporters say he \u2019 s espousing policies from a bygone era .\n\u201c He is stuck back in 1991 and he just couldn \u2019 t ever catch up , \u201d Newman told \u2588\u2588\u2588 , praising Lipinski \u2019 s father for working on infrastructure . \u201c It \u2019 s a misnomer to say [ the district ] is changing dramatically in 10 years . No , it \u2019 s just made great progress over time . \u201d\n\u201c He just blocks out representing the district and turns to his personal beliefs to lead his vote , \u201d Abby McEntee , a progressive activist with Indivisible and a local preschool teacher , said . \u201c Personal beliefs are totally fine , but his job is to represent the district . \u201d\nEven Lipinski \u2019 s most loyal supporters are beginning to see him as an outsider .\n\u201c He had a really close election last time , so what he has to do is find out what the constituents want and sort of modify those positions , \u201d Albert Reiff , a 71-year-old Vietnam War veteran , said . \u201c Like with the women and stuff like that . You \u2019 ve got to understand society is more [ supportive of ] equal wages for equal work , more open-minded with who you can love and stuff like that . He could do it , though . He \u2019 s not like Lindsey Graham . He is a moderate . \u201d\nAt a senior fair in Summit , Illinois , Lipinski was in his element . A group of older constituents , mostly white , many veterans , lined up to share their gripes : Their grandkids were having trouble covering health care bills , the music festival at the local park was too damn loud , the DMV was too confusing . In this community , Lipinski is known for this kind of affair ; he regularly holds events for seniors and veterans . His district office is known for getting their concerns taken care of . Reiff said Lipinski \u2019 s staff organized his paperwork for the Veterans Affairs hospital and got his Vietnam War medals mailed to his home .\nAs far as Reiff was concerned , Newman \u2019 s insurgency is a \u201c reflection of the millenniums \u201d \u2014 referring to the progressive millennial energy that has boosted candidates like Sanders . Lipinski operates in a different world .\nTalking Trump , Lipinski chose his words carefully . According to exit polling , 18 percent of his primary support in 2018 came from Trump supporters . He treaded lightly on impeachment , saying the election was the better way to oust the president , but was undecided in the 2020 presidential primary . He wouldn \u2019 t say whether he sees the national outrage around abortion rights playing inside his district .\n\u201c There are people who are pro-life and there are people who are pro-choice , \u201d Lipinski told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . That was the extent to which he would acknowledge the overwhelming support for abortion rights within his party \u2014 at least in that space . He said his focus was on the \u201c kitchen table issues . \u201d\nThere \u2019 s probably a reason for that . To most in that room , his anti-abortion position was either irrelevant or unknown . There are longtime constituents , like Kathy Voigt , a 72-year-old OB-GYN nurse who voted for Lipinski in 2018 , only to learn about his record on abortion after the fact . She thought , \u201c Criminy , what have I done , \u201d she said , noting that she plans to look into Newman \u2019 s campaign now .\nLipinski has acknowledged the pressure to conform to a progressive viewpoint in the past , telling an anti-abortion media outlet that it \u201c greatly concerns me what the Democratic Party has done in many ways it is difficult to be a practicing Catholic . \u201d\nLori Walsh , 75 , said when walking out the door at the senior fair : \u201c Give him good publicity . He needs it . They \u2019 re pushing him out . \u201d\nNewman came close to defeating Lipinski in 2018 . She thinks she can do it in 2020 .\nLipinski barely hung on last time , winning the Democratic primary by just over 2,000 votes . Already , Newman is outpacing Lipinski in fundraising , with nearly quadruple the individual contributions . She spent the end of last year working on local campaigns to learn even more about the district . Walking through a local farmers market , introducing herself and passing out stickers , she said roughly half the people she comes across at community events know who she is .\nBut House Democrats , facing a tough year to hold on to their current majority , have made incumbents a priority . And it \u2019 s hard to find a greater beneficiary than Lipinski . Newman says her campaign has been forced to create a new way to poll the district : gathering data from outside groups , and relying more on door-to-door events . The DCCC said they made a longstanding policy around vendors public as a matter of transparency ; \u201c The DCCC has worked to change how Washington works , increase transparency in politics , and be perfectly clear with all its partners about the standards it expects of them , \u201d Cole Leiter , a DCCC spokesperson , said in a statement .\nLast cycle , Newman \u2019 s fight against a party apparatus was with the \u201c Chicago Machine , \u201d infamous for its dirty tricks . While Newman can \u2019 t definitively blame the party for her loss in 2018 , she has a long list of fishy happenings she \u2019 s happy to share .\nShe says her office internet would go out without any explanation from the service providers . Her staff \u2019 s cars would get keyed outside the office . And most shocking of all , Newman said her name didn \u2019 t show up on the ballot at all in more than a dozen precincts ( \u2588\u2588\u2588 couldn \u2019 t find a news story reporting this , but did talk to one woman who said Newman \u2019 s name wasn \u2019 t on her ballot in 2018 ) . This time , they will have election watchers on the ground at every polling station . Above all , she says , fighting against the machine is fighting against a negative playbook , which she expects again in full force .\nBut her supporters see the DCCC \u2019 s now public policy around vendors in the same vein .\n\u201c It \u2019 s disappointing the DCCC is learning from the Chicago old-style machine tactics , \u201d Jos\u00e9 Torrez , an immigration activist and educator in the district , said . \u201c We are watching what the Democratic Party is doing . We are not Republicans ; we don \u2019 t block incumbents from challenges . \u201d\nThe DCCC playing in her district like the Chicago political machine was a frightening thought for Newman .\nLaughing , she said only , \u201c I hope not . The machine is pretty darn good , so I \u2019 m scared to hear that . \u201d",
