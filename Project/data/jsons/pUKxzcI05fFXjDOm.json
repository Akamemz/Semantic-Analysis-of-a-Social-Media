A lone individual , encountering white-supremacist propaganda , can become convinced that it is a cause worth fighting for . Timothy McVeigh read The Turner Diaries , a story of a race war written by a notorious white supremacist , before he carried out the Oklahoma City bombings .

According to the latest data from Anti-Defamation League \u2019 s Center on Extremism , white supremacists were responsible for more than half of the 34 fatalities linked to domestic extremists of all stripes last year , claiming 18 lives in 2017 .\nThat represented a reversion to the long-term trend ; right-wing violence had accounted for the largest share of domestic-extremist related killings every year from 1995 until the Pulse nightclub shootings in 2016 .
