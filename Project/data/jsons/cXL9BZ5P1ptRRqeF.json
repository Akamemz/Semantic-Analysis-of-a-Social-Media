    "content": "The Obama administration told federal immigration lawyers to release illegal immigrants with \u201c old \u201d drunken-driving convictions and those found guilty of stealing other people \u2019 s identities , according to a lawsuit filed by one of the lawyers at the center of the operation .\nPatricia M. Vroom , a top attorney for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Arizona , filed a 67-page discrimination complaint that details repeated battles with agency higher-ups who told her to close cases and not deport people whom President Obama deemed low-priority .\nFederal officials were particularly dismissive of identity theft convictions from Arizona , arguing that the state \u2019 s laws were too strict and stealing an ID to get a job wasn \u2019 t a serious enough offense to get kicked out of the country .\n\u201c This was a very significant development , as generally , criminal aliens , particularly convicted felons , are , under the [ prosecutorial discretion ] memos , \u2018 priority \u2019 cases that should be aggressively pursued , \u201d Ms. Vroom said in her complaint .\nBut she said her superiors deemed the identity theft felons low-level offenders \u201c since the typical alien defendant convicted under these provisions of Arizona criminal law had simply been using a fake I.D . to get and keep employment . \u201d\nHomeland Security officials said the department , of which ICE is a part , was looking over the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Arizona .\n\u201c We are reviewing the allegations in the complaint , which largely refer to events from 2012 and 2013 concerning workplace environment and various personnel decisions taken by key officials , some of whom have since left the department , \u201d spokeswoman Marsha Catron said .\n\u201c The leadership of both [ the Department of Homeland Security ] and ICE take these allegations seriously and , when founded , will always take the appropriate disciplinary action , \u201d she said .\nMs. Vroom , who filed the complaint Nov. 6 , declined to comment through her attorney .\nIn her complaint , she detailed a September conversation in which top ICE lawyers told staff to ignore \u201c old \u201d DUI convictions if immigrants had enough \u201c equities , \u201d such as ties to the community or family responsibilities in the U.S. , that would outweigh their criminal behavior .\nICE officials and Mr. Obama have defended their prosecutorial discretion , saying they have enough resources to deport only about 400,000 immigrants a year , so it makes sense to go after the most serious criminals , recent border crossers and those who have violated immigration laws repeatedly .\n\u201c We \u2019 re misallocating resources .
