    "content": "In a heartfelt dissent to today 's Supreme Court ruling upholding Michigan 's voter-approved ban on race=-based admission programs in its public colleges , Justice Sonia Sotomayor speaks from experience about the complex impact of such affirmative action programs on her own life .\nSotomayor , who is joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , dedicates 58 pages to the dissent and highlights one central theme : Race matters . It 's the first time she has ever read a dissent from the bench , though she just recently told the Yale Law Journal that such readings are `` like entertainment for the press '' and `` I really wish it did n't happen at all . '' But , she added , `` it 's become a signal of how fiercely someone believes that the Court is wrong , and I understand some of that value . ''\nIn her dissent , she notes that voters in Michigan could have used other means to eliminate the use of race-sensitive admissions policies . `` They could have persuaded existing board members to change their minds through individual or grassroots lobbying efforts , or through general public awareness campaigns , '' she says . `` Or they could have mobilized efforts to vote uncooperative board members out of office , replacing them with members who would share their desire to abolish race-sensitive admissions policies . ''\nBut instead she invokes the `` political process doctrine '' and says : `` A majority of the Michigan electorate changed the basic rules of the political process '' and `` uniquely disadvantaged racial minorities . ''\nREAD MORE ABOUT TODAY 'S SUPREME COURT RULING Here 's her reasoning , which tracks with the lower court that struck down the ban : `` A citizen who is a University of Michigan alumnus , for instance , can advocate for an admissions policy that considers an applicant 's legacy status by meeting individually with members of the Board of Regents to convince them of her views , by joining with other legacy parents to lobby the board , or by voting for and supporting Board candidates who share her position . ''\nShe says those options are available to citizens who want the board to adopt policies that might consider athleticism , geography and area of study . But she goes on : `` The one and only policy a Michigan citizen may not seek through this long-established process is a race-sensitive admissions policy that considered race in an individualized manner when it is clear that race-neutral alternatives are not adequate to achieve diversity . ''\nShe says the voter initiative `` restructures the political process '' in Michigan to place unique burdens on racial minorities .\nSotomayor writes , `` While our Constitution does not guarantee minority groups victory in the political process , it does guarantee them meaningful and equal access to that process . ''\n`` It guarantees that the majority may not win by stacking the political process against minority groups permanently , forcing the minority alone to surmount unique obstacles in pursuit of its goals-here , educational diversity . ''\nAnd then she gets into the issue of race . `` My colleagues , '' she says , `` are of the view that we should leave race out of the picture entirely and let the voters sort it out . ''\nShe takes a dig at Chief Justice John Roberts who wrote once , `` The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discrimination on the basis of race . '' Sotomayor says : `` It is a sentiment out of touch with reality . ''\nSotomayor says , `` Race matters . Race matters in part because of the long history of racial minorities ' being denied access to the political process . '' `` Race matters to a young man 's view of society when he spends his teenage years watching others tense up as he passes , no matter what neighborhood he grew up . Race matters to a young woman 's sense of self when she states her hometown , and then is pressed , 'No , where are you really from ? ' ''\nSotomayor says , `` The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to speak openly and candidly on the subject of race , and to apply the Constitution with eyes open to the unfortunate effects of centuries of racial discrimination . ''\nAfter citing what she perceives as the negative impact of Michigan 's ban on diversity , Sotomayor says she `` can not ignore the unfortunate outcome of today 's decision . ''\n`` The Constitution does not protect racial minorities from political defeat . But neither does it give the majority free rein to erect selective barriers against racial minorities . ''\nAt oral arguments Sotomayor was the most vocal opponent of the ban . In fact , at one point , she asked a lawyer for Michigan a line of questions regarding its impact . When she was finished Chief Justice John Roberts pointedly said to the lawyer , `` You have been asked several questions that refer to the ending or termination of affirmative action . That 's not what is at issue here , is it ? ''\nIn her recent memoir , My Beloved World , Sotomayor writes about the impact of affirmative action in her life . She details her time at Princeton : `` The Daily Princetonian routinely published letters to the editor lamenting the presence on campus of `` affirmative action students , '' each one of whom had presumably displaced a far more deserving affluent white male and could rightly be expected to crash into the gutter built of her own unrealistic aspirations . There were vultures circling , ready to dive when we stumbled . The pressure to succeed was relentless , even if self-imposed out of fear and insecurity . ''\nLater she tells a story about an experience at a recruiting dinner hosted by a well-respected Washington firm . One partner told her the `` problem '' with affirmative action is that `` you have to wait to see if people are qualified or not . Do you think you would have been admitted to Yale Law School if you were not Puerto Rican ? ''\n`` It probably did n't hurt , '' a stunned Sotomayor said , `` but I imagine that graduating summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from Princeton had something to do with it too . ''\nSotomayor , 59 , writes that `` much has changed '' in the thinking about affirmative action `` since those early days when it opened doors in my life . But one thing has not changed : to doubt the worth of minority students ' achievement when they succeed is really only to present another face of the prejudice that would deny them a chance even to try .
