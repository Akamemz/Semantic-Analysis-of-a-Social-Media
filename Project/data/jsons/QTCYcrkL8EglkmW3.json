And I \u2019 m putting restrictions on foreign aid instead of eliminating foreign aid altogether .

About 500 campers sat attentively , while several others stood off to the side , Hula-Hooping as they listened . Arrayed before Gillespie were several boxes of exotically flavored Pop-Tarts that he had purchased at the Lancaster grocery store . He held them up as evidence that individualism was flourishing and choices were in abundance or , as he put it , \u201c The libertarian moment is now. \u201d Their moment had arrived , Gillespie said , \u201c because the main political drivers have destroyed their credibility . Only the dead think the G.O.P . is the party of small government. \u201d At the same time , he added , \u201c the Democrats had a clean shot to demonstrate that they \u2019 d protect our liberties , and they proved themselves to be utter frauds . \u201d\nWith deadpan aplomb , Gillespie then said , \u201c If we can have 20 different types of Pop-Tarts , maybe we can have more than two types of political identification . \u201d\nAfter the speech was over and Gillespie gamely posed for a few pictures with admirers , I cornered him and asked him if he was suggesting that libertarians leave the G.O.P.-flavored Pop-Tarts on the shelf . Gillespie said it all depended on Republicans . \u201c This is the fundamental question for the Republican Party , \u201d he said . \u201c Are they going to embrace the libertarian elements of Rand Paul and Justin Amash ? Because that \u2019 s their only way out . They \u2019 re at 25 percent self-identification , and it \u2019 s not going to climb back up if they keep re-electing the old horses . Libertarians don \u2019 t need them . We \u2019 re already alienated and out of the mainstream . We don \u2019 t need the Republican Party in the way that they need the energy and the vision of libertarians . \u201d\nBut , I wanted to know , would libertarians be willing to meet the G.O.P . somewhere in the middle ?

The crowd here at PorcFest , many of them young , all of them passionate , represented just the sort of army that Paul would need in the early primary states and beyond \u2014 the same sort of army , in fact , that powered his father \u2019 s improbable showing in previous elections . But they still talked more about the father than the son .\nGillespie acknowledged that the answer remained unclear . \u201c I think that if a major-party candidate articulates 75 percent of the catechism , \u201d he said , \u201c both self-identified libertarians and people who don \u2019 t realize they \u2019 re libertarians would vote for him. \u201d But then again , he said , it might take \u201c a hundred years or something \u201d for his movement to find its true expression in a political party . \u201c We \u2019 ve gone from a movement that didn \u2019 t exist , then we all believe in this roughly similar thing , then we have a dalliance with the G.O.P. , then we realize , no , we \u2019 re totally separate .
