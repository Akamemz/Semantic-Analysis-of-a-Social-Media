    "content": "This is \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s breakdown of the highlights from Zuckerberg \u2019 s speech , what they mean and how they may play in Washington \u2019 s tech debate :\n\u201c We did n't have the broad free speech protections that we have now until the 1960s , when the Supreme Court ruled in opinions like New York Times vs. Sullivan that they can criticize public figures as long as they 're not doing so with actual malice , even if what you 're saying is false . \u201d\nHere , he is citing a landmark 1964 Supreme Court decision that freed the news media to aggressively cover public officials without the threat of libel suits for inadvertent mistakes . By nodding to a court case that 's a staple of journalism schools , Zuckerberg is aiming for some common ground with the news media , even as that industry lobbies Congress to help news companies compete with Facebook and Google for digital ad money .\nZuckerberg also points out an often-overlooked aspect of the SCOTUS case : It involved an ad , much like the ones Facebook sells .\n\u201c Now , some people believe that giving more people a voice is driving division rather than bringing people together . More people across the spectrum believe that achieving the political outcomes that they think matter is more important than every person having a voice and being heard . And I think that that \u2019 s dangerous . \u201d\nZuckerberg alludes to recent criticisms from Democratic leaders , most notably presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren , who say the platform has done too little to crack down on misinformation from politicians such as President Donald Trump . Zuckerberg tries to flip the critics ' arguments on their head , saying it 's `` dangerous '' \u2014 not just politically expedient \u2014 for a candidate to urge a social media company to take down a foe 's message .\n\u201c In times of social tension , our impulse is often to pull back from free expression because we want the progress that comes in from free expression but we do n't want this tension . We saw this when Martin Luther King Jr. wrote his famous letter from a Birmingham Jail when he was unconstitutionally jailed for protesting peacefully . And we saw this in the effort to shut down campus protests during the Vietnam war . We saw this way back when America was deeply polarized about its role in World War I and the Supreme Court ruled at the time that the socialist leader Eugene Debs could be imprisoned for making an anti-war speech . In the end all of these decisions were wrong . \u201d\nMartin Luther King 's letter is a foundational text for civil rights activists and a revered part of American history . Citing it , as well as the experience of dissenters stretch back to Debs , is a way to remind the left that its own heritage has relied on free speech .\nThe short version of Zuckerberg 's message : `` People in power often roll back human rights when times get tough and scary . Do n't be those people . ''\nBut the CEO is on potentially treacherous ground if people think he 's trying to liken his hugely profitable corporation to a hero like King .\n\u201c Take livestreaming for example . This allows families to be together for moments like birthdays . We 've even had a few weddings . It allows schoolteachers to read children bedtime stories they might not otherwise have read to . Of course it allows us to witness some really important cultural moments . But we \u2019 ve also seen people broadcast self harm and suicide , some terrible acts . \u201d\nZuckerberg 's company faced huge criticism after a gunman used Facebook Live to stream the video of two mosque massacres that killed 51 people last March in Christchurch , New Zealand \u2014 including demands that Facebook just yank the service . Zuckerberg 's effort to paint a picture of people celebrating their birthdays via Facebook Live \u2014 how often does that really happen ? \u2014 suggests that he has n't really figured out his argument for not shutting it down .\n\u201c I believe that we have two responsibilities : to remove content when it can cause real danger as effectively as we can and to fight to uphold as wide of a definition of freedom of expression as possible and to not allow the definition of what is considered dangerous to expand beyond what is absolutely necessary . \u201d\nThe funny thing here is that Congress , too , thought online platforms had those same two responsibilities when it passed Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act , a law that protects online companies from lawsuits over content from their users .\nThe thinking back then : If all these new websites did a decent job handling the worst of what people post , they could otherwise be largely left alone . Silicon Valley regularly cites that law as the only reason the internet has flourished as it has .\nBut in recent years many Democrats and at least some Republicans have argued that Facebook \u2014 plus Google , Twitter and others \u2014 have failed to maintain a basic level of decency on their platforms , letting everything from ads for sexual slavery to terrorist recruitment materials run rampant . And because of it , Congress has started rolling back Section 230 .\n\u201c We do n't fact check political ads and we do n't do this to help politicians , but because we think people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying . For the same reason , if content is newsworthy , we also wo n't take it down . \u201d\nZuckerberg has argued again and again that Facebook does n't want the company 's moderators serving as `` arbiters of truth . '' For one thing , that would require the company to hire on or contract a whole lot of moderators .\nBut here , Zuckerberg 's trying to align himself with those who find his own power over the speech of 2 billion people to be unsettling . Of course , he gave himself much of that power by structuring Facebook , from its founding , as almost totally under his control .\n\u201c We do n't fact check political ads and we do n't do this to help politicians , but because we think people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying . For the same reason , if content is newsworthy , we also wo n't take it down . \u201d\nPart of what Zuckerberg was trying to pull off with this speech was cleaning up for Nick Clegg , the company 's head of global public policy ( and a former deputy prime minister in the United Kingdom ) . In remarks a few weeks ago in D.C. , Clegg laid out the company 's policy of not pulling down politicians ' misleading content . The result was n't what Facebook intended \u2014 Clegg 's remarks caused much confusion and anger from its critics , including Democratic frontrunners Warren and Joe Biden .\nBut Zuckerberg 's message was n't much different from Clegg 's . Facebook is betting on the broader arc of Zuckerberg 's speech to help the rest of us make sense of the policy . But a punchier talking point here would probably have helped , too .\n\u201c I know many people disagree with this , but in general , I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy . And we are not an outlier here . The other major internet platforms and the vast majority of media also run the same ads . \u201d\nFacebook has faced the brunt of criticism from Democrats for running a misleading Trump campaign ad attacking Biden . Here , Zuckerberg points out that competitors like Google-owned YouTube and Twitter , plus mainstream news outlets like Fox News and MSNBC , also signed off on the advertisement .\n\u201c Given the sensitivity around political ads , I \u2019 ve considered whether we should stop allowing them altogether . From a business perspective , the controversy certainly is not worth the very small part of our business that they make up . But political ads can be an important part of voice , especially for local candidates and up-and-coming challengers and advocacy groups the media might not otherwise cover so that way they can get their voice into the debate . Banning political ads favors incumbents and whoever the media chooses to cover . But practically , even if we wanted to ban political ads , it \u2019 s not even clear where you draw the line . \u201d\nZuckerberg addresses the elephant in the room : Facebook profits from having more relaxed rules for political advertising . The company has already pocketed more than $ 50 million from 2020 candidates running ads on its platform , according to figures compiled by \u2588\u2588\u2588 . Even though that amount might just be a `` small part '' of Facebook 's business , as Zuckerberg notes , it still calls into question the notion that it 's willingness to greenlight nearly all political ads is rooted purely in high-minded ideals . And his all-or-nothing framing sets up a bit of a false dichotomy ; not everyone objecting to Facebook letting candidates including Trump lie in ads wants a total ban on political advertising .\n\u201c I wanted our services in China because I believe in connecting the whole world . And I thought maybe we could help create a more open society . This is something I worked hard on for a long time . But we could never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there . And they never let us in . And now we have more freedom to speak out and stand up for the values that we believe in and fight for free expression around the world . \u201d\nThese comments highlight the tech industry 's challenging relationship with China , a hugely lucrative market where competitors like Google have struggled with how to navigate Beijing 's strict controls on free speech . Not to mention the endless political headaches in Washington .\nZuckerberg 's criticism of China may also play well in the Trump White House , which has been waging a trade war in an attempt to counter Chinese influence around the world .

Zuckerberg tries to flip the critics' arguments on their head, saying it's \"dangerous\" \u2014 not just politically expedient \u2014 for a candidate to urge a social media company to take down a foe's message.\n\nLEARN THE LESSONS OF HISTORY\n\n\u201cIn times of social tension, our impulse is often to pull back from free expression because we want the progress that comes in from free expression but we don't want this tension. We saw this when Martin Luther King Jr. wrote his famous letter from a Birmingham Jail when he was unconstitutionally jailed for protesting peacefully.

This allows families to be together for moments like birthdays. We've even had a few weddings. It allows schoolteachers to read children bedtime stories they might not otherwise have read to. Of course it allows us to witness some really important cultural moments. But we\u2019ve also seen people broadcast self harm and suicide, some terrible acts.\u201d\n\n\n\nZuckerberg's company faced huge criticism after a gunman used Facebook Live to stream the video of two mosque massacres that killed 51 people last March in Christchurch, New Zealand \u2014 including demands that Facebook just yank the service. Zuckerberg's effort to paint a picture of people celebrating their birthdays via Facebook Live \u2014 how often does that really happen? \u2014 suggests that he hasn't really figured out his argument for not shutting it down.\n\nA MESSAGE TAILORED FOR LAWMAKERS\n\n\u201cI believe that we have two responsibilities: to remove content when it can cause real danger as effectively as we can and to fight to uphold as wide of a definition of freedom of expression as possible and to not allow the definition of what is considered dangerous to expand beyond what is absolutely necessary.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe funny thing here is that Congress, too, thought online platforms had those same two responsibilities when it passed Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, a law that protects online companies from lawsuits over content from their users.\n\nThe thinking back then: If all these new websites did a decent job handling the worst of what people post, they could otherwise be largely left alone.

For the same reason, if content is newsworthy, we also won't take it down.\u201d\n\n\n\nZuckerberg has argued again and again that Facebook doesn't want the company's moderators serving as \"arbiters of truth.\" For one thing, that would require the company to hire on or contract a whole lot of moderators.\n\nBut here, Zuckerberg's trying to align himself with those who find his own power over the speech of 2 billion people to be unsettling. Of course, he gave himself much of that power by structuring Facebook, from its founding, as almost totally under his control.\n\nLET'S TRY THIS ARGUMENT AGAIN\n\n\u201cWe don't fact check political ads and we don't do this to help politicians, but because we think people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying. For the same reason, if content is newsworthy, we also won't take it down.\u201d\n\n\n\nPart of what Zuckerberg was trying to pull off with this speech was cleaning up for Nick Clegg, the company's head of global public policy (and a former deputy prime minister in the United Kingdom).

But a punchier talking point here would probably have helped, too.\n\nOTHER COMPANIES RAN TRUMP'S AD TOO\n\n\u201cI know many people disagree with this, but in general, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy. And we are not an outlier here.

From a business perspective, the controversy certainly is not worth the very small part of our business that they make up. But political ads can be an important part of voice, especially for local candidates and up-and-coming challengers and advocacy groups the media might not otherwise cover so that way they can get their voice into the debate.

And his all-or-nothing framing sets up a bit of a false dichotomy; not everyone objecting to Facebook letting candidates including Trump lie in ads wants a total ban on political advertising.\n\nTECH AND CHINA: 'IT'S COMPLICATED'\n\n\u201cI wanted our services in China because I believe in connecting the whole world. And I thought maybe we could help create a more open society. This is something I worked hard on for a long time. But we could never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there. And they never let us in.
