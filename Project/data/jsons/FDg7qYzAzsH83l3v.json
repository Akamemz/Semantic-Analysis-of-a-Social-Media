The ruling is due to be implemented in 90 days so that the Department of Homeland Security can conduct additional operational planning , the Justice Department said .\nBut the ruling has limited practical implications because the administration is barred from holding families for more than 20 days under a court settlement and has opted to stop separating children and adults as a matter of practice .\nThe government has also said it no longer has space to detain most of the thousands of immigrants arriving each day at the U.S. border with Mexico .
