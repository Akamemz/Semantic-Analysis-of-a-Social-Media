So to understand how it \u2019 s going to play out , the past is really our best guide . \u201c I think we \u2019 re just all in for a really crazy ride. \u201d Collectively , these New York Times reporters have covered U.S. politics for over 150 years . \u201c I \u2019 m also a drummer in a band , so \u2026 \u201d They \u2019 ve reported on past impeachment inquiries . \u201c Yea , I \u2019 m lost in Senate wonderland. \u201d And they say that the three we \u2019 ve had so far have been full of twists and turns . \u201c The president of the United States is not guilty as charged. \u201d In short , expect the unexpected . First , the process . Impeachment is technically only the initial stage . \u201c Common misconceptions about impeachment are that impeachment by itself means removal from office . It doesn \u2019 t . The impeachment part of the process is only the indictment that sets up a trial. \u201d The Constitution describes offenses that are grounds for removing the president from office as bribery , treason and \u2014 \u201c They say high crimes and misdemeanors , which , really , is in the eye of the beholder. \u201d \u201c The framers didn \u2019 t give us a guidebook to it . They simply said , that the House had the responsibility for impeachment and the Senate had the responsibility for the trial. \u201d One of the things missing from the Constitution ? How an impeachment inquiry should start . And that has generally been a source of drama . Basically , anything goes . \u201c In fact , in the Andrew Johnson case they voted to impeach him without even having drafted the articles of impeachment. \u201d For Richard Nixon , his case started with several investigations that led to public hearings . That part of the process went on for two years , and yielded revelation after revelation , connecting Nixon to a politically-motivated burglary at D.N.C . headquarters \u2014 \u201c \u2026 located in the Watergate office building. \u201d \u2014 and its subsequent cover-up . \u201c Mr . Butterfield , are you aware of the installation of any listening devices in the Oval Office of the president ? \u201d \u201c I was aware of listening devices . Yes , sir. \u201d \u201c This was a shocker . Everybody in the White House recognized how damaging this could be. \u201d As the House drafted articles of impeachment , Nixon lost the support of his party . \u201c O.K. , I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow. \u201d \u201c I was asked to write the farewell piece that ran the morning after Nixon resigned . And this is what I wrote : The central question is how a man who won so much could have lost so much. \u201d So for Nixon , it more or less ended after the investigations . But for Bill Clinton , that phase was just the beginning . \u201c This is the information. \u201d An independent counsel \u2019 s investigation into his business dealings unexpectedly turned into a very public inquiry about his personal life . \u201c The idea that a president of the United States was having an affair with a White House intern and then a federal prosecutor was looking at that , it was just extraordinary. \u201d That investigation led to public hearings in the House Judiciary Committee . \u201c When the Starr Report was being delivered to Congress it was a little bit like the O.J . chase , only a political one . There were two black cars . They were being filmed live on CNN . They were heading towards the Capitol . We were watching it and a little bit agog. \u201d Public opinion is key . And the media plays a huge part in the process . This was definitely true for Clinton . \u201c You know it was just a crazy time . We worked in the Senate press gallery. \u201d \u201c All your colleagues are kind of piled on top of each other. \u201d \u201c We had crummy computers , the fax machine would always break . The printer would always break. \u201d After committee hearings , the House brought formal impeachment charges . \u201c It was very tense . I thought that the Saturday of the impeachment vote in the House was one of the most tense days I \u2019 d experienced in Washington. \u201d And it turned out , also , full of surprises . \u201c The day of impeachment arrived , everyone \u2019 s making very impassioned speeches about whether Bill Clinton should or should not be impeached and Livingston rises to give an argument for the House Republicans . He started to talk about how Clinton could resign. \u201d \u201c You , sir , may resign your post. \u201d \u201c And all of a sudden people start booing and saying , \u2018 Resign , resign \u2019 ! \u201d \u201c So I must set the example. \u201d \u201c He announced he was resigning because he had had extramarital affairs and challenged President Clinton to do the only honorable thing , in his view \u2014 \u201d \u201c I hope President Clinton will follow. \u201d \u201c \u2014 to resign as well , so there was all this drama unfolding even in the midst of impeachment. \u201d Then it went to the Senate for trial . The Constitution gets a little more specific about this part . \u201c The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is supposed to preside over that trial. \u201d \u201c Rehnquist , he showed up in this robe he had made for himself , which had gold stripes on the sleeves because he liked Gilbert and Sullivan. \u201d \u201c The Senate is the actual jury. \u201d \u201c You will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws . So help you , God. \u201d \u201c This is a copy of the rules of the Senate for handling impeachment . They \u2019 re actually very specific. \u201d \u201c Meet six days a week. \u201d \u201c Convene at noon . The senators have to sit at their desks and remain quiet in their role as jurors . And not talk , which trust me , is going to be a problem for some of the senators who are used to talking all the time. \u201d It \u2019 s just like a courtroom trial . There are prosecutors who present the case against the president . \u201c That was perjury. \u201d Only , they \u2019 re members of the House , and they \u2019 re called managers . Then the senators , or the jurors , vote . And things are still , unpredictable . \u201c The options are guilty or not guilty . But there was one senator \u2014 \u201d \u201c Arlen Specter , a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania. \u201d \u201c Under Scottish law , there are three possible verdicts : guilty , not guilty and not proved. \u201d \u201c \u2014 which is not a thing. \u201d \u201c And everybody just looks , you know , how do you even record that vote ? \u201d In the end , there were not enough votes to oust Clinton . \u201c What \u2019 s amazing about this whole thing to me wasn \u2019 t so much the constitutional process . It was that it felt to me like the beginning of really intense partisanship , the weaponization of partisanship. \u201d And here \u2019 s the thing : An impeachment charge has never gotten the two-thirds majority it needs in the Senate to actually oust a president from office . \u201c So you could end up having a situation where the president is impeached , acquitted and runs for re-election and wins re-election. \u201d And that would be a first . \u201c This is my ticket to the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton . I don \u2019 t think you \u2019 ll find these on StubHub . \u201d",
