He has 60 full-time staffers in Iowa .\nCampaign finance is \u201c one of my favorites , \u201d he says in response to a question , boiling the issue down to a simple equation : It \u2019 s not a democracy , he says , if dollars can outvote people . If Citizens United , the landmark 2010 Supreme Court decision , can \u2019 t be overturned , he adds , Congress should pass a constitutional amendment to \u201c tune up our democracy . \u201d\nAnd speaking of democracy , he suggests counting up all the votes in a presidential election and letting the person with the most win .

It \u2019 s not just about freedom from regulations or onerous taxes . It \u2019 s about freedom to choose how to live \u2013 freedom for women to choose ( one of his biggest applause lines ) , to get quality health care , or to marry whomever you want , regardless of what a county clerk thinks .\nHe and his supporters know such positions can be a hard sell in Iowa , where religious conservatives hold significant sway . \u201c When I enthuse about you , people say , \u2018 America isn \u2019 t ready to elect a gay man president , \u2019 \u201d a man tells Mr. Buttigieg at a campaign stop . Ireland has a gay prime minister and South Bend seems to have gotten over it , he continues . How can I convince them ?\nMr. Buttigieg responds by sharing his own decision to come out after serving as a Navy Reserves intelligence officer in Afghanistan and returning to his job as mayor . He won reelection several months later with 80 % of the vote .\n\u201c God does not belong to a political party , \u201d he is fond of saying , adding that the Bible shouldn \u2019 t be used as a cudgel to tell people they don \u2019 t belong . He cites Scripture about feeding the hungry and caring for the stranger , and accuses the Trump administration of violating such tenets . He hopes , he tells the crowd in Muscatine , to make it \u201c OK for those who are guided by faith to know that they don \u2019 t have to be pushed into the arms of the religious right \u2013 whose latest political decisions betray not only our values but also their own . \u201d\nAnd what about those whose deeply held convictions \u2013 religious or otherwise \u2013 do differ from his ? He would like to persuade them , he says , but acknowledges that , \u201c I won \u2019 t convince everybody , and that \u2019 s OK. \u201d He adds , however , \u201c that people who think a lot about freedom \u2013 conservatives and libertarians \u2013 should pause at a moment like this ... and ask if this isn \u2019 t a chance for resetting the entire spectrum in a way that will make Americans better off . \u201d\nBack in Burlington , as the last of some 500 attendees trickle out , someone with the Buttigieg campaign approaches Mr. Kupferschmid to return the baseball he had hoped Mayor Pete would sign .\n\u201c Hi Gary , I apologize profusely , \u201d says the young man . \u201c That \u2019 s OK , it \u2019 s better than Kamala Harris , \u201d says Mr. Kupferschmid , who at least got his \u201c Pete Buttigieg for President \u201d button signed . \u201c And he seems more genuine . \u201d\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .
