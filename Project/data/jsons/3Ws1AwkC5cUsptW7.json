    "content": "Douglas Laycock , a law professor at the University of Virginia , has been a longtime supporter of same-sex marriage . What \u2019 s made him unusual is that in recent years he \u2019 s been trying to make the case to liberals that \u201c same-sex marriage and religious liberty can co-exist. \u201d In 2017 he co-authored an article at Vox with another law professor to argue that Jack Phillips , the Evangelical Christian baker in Colorado at the center of the Masterpiece Cakeshop Supreme Court case , should be allowed to follow his conscience to not bake a cake for a same-sex wedding .\nLaycock has also been a longtime supporter of enacting a federal gay-rights non-discrimination law , but he doesn \u2019 t support the Equality Act , a bill just approved by the House of Representatives that would add \u201c sexual orientation \u201d and \u201c gender identity \u201d to the 1964 Civil Rights Act , because it would \u201c crush \u201d conscientious objectors .\n\u201c It goes very far to stamp out religious exemptions , \u201d Laycock tells \u2588\u2588\u2588 in an email . \u201c It regulates religious non-profits . And then it says that [ the Religious Freedom Restoration Act ] does not apply to any claim under the Equality Act . This would be the first time Congress has limited the reach of RFRA .
