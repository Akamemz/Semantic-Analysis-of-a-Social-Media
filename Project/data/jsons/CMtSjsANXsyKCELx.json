    "content": "As the Rolling Stone UVA story continues to disintegrate , they were n't the only publication that had a really bad week ; it was the liberal media in general . First , let 's discuss the Rolling Stone fiasco . They added to their `` note to our readers '' after other media outlets , namely the Washington Post , eviscerated them when it was discovered that Sabrina Rubin Erdely , who wrote the UVA piece , did n't contact the alleged attackers of Jackie ; the central figure of the article . But , there are a few discrepancies in her account , like the frat never hosting a party on the night of her alleged attack .\nThe Post 's Erik Wemple has documented this meltdown extensively . On the Stone 's recent addition to their partial retraction , he noted how the magazine took the blame , but noted that their continued investigation into the events of Jackie 's alleged attack probably should 've been done `` before publishing . '' While laying out reasons for why the UVA disaster is a case of media bias , Wemple discovered this interesting 2006 quote from Stone Managing Editor Will Dana , \u201c we \u2019 ll write what we believe [ italicized text is from Baker ] : ''\nIn a 2006 appearance at Middlebury College , Dana gave a speech titled , \u201c The Myth of Fair and Balanced : A Defense of Biased Reporting. \u201d According to a writeup in the Middlebury Campus , Dana put forth a common and compelling critique of contemporary standards under which journalists \u201c worship the grail of objectivity \u201d and \u201c play twister to hide their bias , \u201d said Dana , a 1985 graduate of Middlebury . \u201c I want to do stuff that \u2019 s biased. \u201d He merely meant journalism driven by a worldview , as with Eric Schlosser \u2019 s 1998 Rolling Stone expose , \u201c Fast-Food Nation \u201d \u2014 a series that upended thinking on the world \u2019 s McDonald \u2019 s and the like . \u201c We can become the seed pod for great things , \u201d said Dana of such work . Though the editor said his publication would endeavor to give both sides of a story , he said , \u201c we \u2019 ll write what we believe , \u201d according to the Middlebury Campus . \u2026 Here \u2019 s the thing about all these projects , as explained by the reporter , Aylie Baker , who covered Dana \u2019 s 2006 talk at Middlebury : \u201c [ B ] ias , \u201d maintains Dana , \u201c does not mean unbalanced. \u201d If anything . it sets the bar higher for Rolling Stones \u2019 writers . They have to exercise extreme depth of analysis and reporting in writing their stories . In fact , confided Dana , his all-time favorite stories are those which deliberately framed extremely controversial issues in a manner which was both emotive and unabashedly honest . Bold text denotes a standard recklessly abandoned in \u201c A Rape on Campus . \u201d\nWhile the Rolling Stone comes to grips with its awful reporting\u2013and others noting how Erdely 's past stories seem like `` bad Lifetime movies '' \u2013let 's take a stroll down to the New Republic , which saw some of the leading figures at the left-of-center publication resign in protest over the direction of the company , which was bought by Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes , husband of Sean Eldridge who ran a rather disastrous 2014 congressional campaign in New York ; he lost by 30 points .\nFirst , Hughes threw a 100th anniversary party for the New Republic prior to the gutting , which is awkward to say the least . Then , the Republic fired editor Franklin Foer\u2013and did n't tell him . He found out by reading a piece on Gawker that he was being replaced , called Hughes to confirm , and Hughes admitted that this development was indeed true . Then again , Hughes and Guy Vidra , a former Yahoo ! News executive , did n't really have the best relationship with the TNR staff :\nWhen Facebook billionaire Chris Hughes , the owner of The New Republic , and TNR \u2019 s newly installed CEO , former Yahoo News executive Guy Vidra , visited the storied magazine \u2019 s Washington headquarters on Friday morning to meet with the staff , they were greeted by a skeleton crew of a few editorial interns and junior employees . Hughes \u2019 s and Vidra \u2019 s decision to abruptly change the 100-year-old journal of politics , policy , art and culture into what Hughes calls a \u201c digital media company \u201d and relocate to Manhattan\u2014and in the process get rid of top editor Franklin Foer , who has run the magazine on and off since 2006 , and literary editor Leon Wieseltier , a major figure at TNR since the early 1980s\u2014has prompted a mass exodus by more than two dozen senior editors and writers . \u2026 For Foer , Wieseltier and others at the magazine , the brutal shakeup by Vidra , 40 , who was hired in September , and his 30-year-old patron , Hughes\u2014who purchased TNR two-and-a-half years ago for an undisclosed sum from a consortium that included longtime owner Martin Peretz\u2014didn \u2019 t come as a surprise . Tensions have been building since the summer . According to multiple sources , Hughes came to think of his writers and editors as \u201c spoiled brats , \u201d and especially disliked the flamboyant , feud-prone , white-maned Wieseltier , who was more than twice his age . Much of Hughes \u2019 s distaste was telegraphed in his body language ; he strikes many TNR staffers as passive-aggressive and averse to confrontation . \u2026 Vidra spoke in what one witness described as \u201c Silicon Valley jargon , \u201d and , using a tech clich\u00e9 , declared : \u201c We \u2019 re going to break s * * t \u201d \u2014a vow hardly calculated to ingratiate himself with TNR \u2019 s veteran belle-lettrists , who feared that he was threatening the magazine \u2019 s destruction . Only a few interns dared to ask questions , which Vidra repeatedly dodged . \u201c The senior people were too shocked to speak , \u201d said a witness . \u201c Jaws were dropping to the floor. \u201d Through it all , Chris Hughes nodded approvingly , an unnerving grin on his face . To be sure , that meeting was a warning sign . But the manner in which the two technology mavens administered their coup de gr\u00e2ce only two months later has left a bitter taste . According to informed sources , Hughes and Vidra didn \u2019 t bother to inform Foer that he was out of a job . Instead , the editor was placed in the humiliating position of having to phone Hughes to get confirmation after Gawker.com posted an item at 2:35 p.m. reporting the rumor that Bloomberg Media editor Gabriel Snyder , himself a onetime Gawker editor , had been hired as Foer \u2019 s replacement . Yes , it \u2019 s true , Hughes sheepishly admitted , notwithstanding that he and Vidra had given Foer repeated assurances that his job was safe .\n\u201c It was like the Red Wedding in Game of Thrones , \u201d said former senior editor Julia Ioffe when Foer and Wieseltier announced that they had decided to part ways with TNR .\nNow , as Larry O'Connor , Editor-At-Large for IJReview , noted that these events usually come in threes . Well , let 's just combine the Daily Show 's erroneous reporting on police shootings and the Huffington Post misquoting National Review columnist A.J . Delgaldo on her piece about sexual assault on campus to make the third offense .\nJon Stewart is apologizing for mentioning a Southern California death in a list of police shootings of black men . `` The Daily Show '' host responded Friday to criticism from the San Bernardino County district attorney . On his show Monday , Stewart mentioned Dante Parker in the shooting list . Parker died in August after he was jolted with a stun gun during a scuffle with sheriff 's deputies . The coroner concluded he died from a drug overdose and cardiovascular disease . Stewart apologized to District Attorney Mike Ramos in a Twitter message that said it was `` sloppy '' to put Parker in the shooting list and promised a TV apology would come next Monday .\nWith Huffington Post , A.J Delgaldo found something a bit strange in a segment she did for HuffPostLive back in May on the subject of rape on college campuses ; they attributed a quote from her column at NRO that she did n't write .
