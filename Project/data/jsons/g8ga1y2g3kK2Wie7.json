    "content": "Democratic socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D\u2013N.Y . ) today introduced a House resolution outlining her long-awaited Green New Deal . The resolution , as \u2588\u2588\u2588 's Ron Bailey reported earlier today , cites climate change concerns as justification for a plan that would remake the U.S. economy over the next 10 years .\nThe resolution 's aims include `` overhauling transportation systems in the United States to eliminate pollution and 19 greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible . '' According to an overview of the resolution , this will be accomplished , in part , by `` build [ ing ] out highspeed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary . ''\nIn other words , the Green New Deal wants to make commercial air travel obsolete . Is this in any way feasible ? The short answer is no . `` It 's actually probably even dumber than it seems , '' says Baruch Feigenbaum , assistant director of transportation policy at the \u2588\u2588\u2588 Foundation , the nonprofit that publishes this website .\nPaul Blair , director of strategic initiatives at Americans for Tax Reform , was even blunter . `` The Green New Deal reads like word vomit from a 13-year-old child asked to scribble out their bold new thoughts for a radically different America than we have today , '' Blair said in a email to \u2588\u2588\u2588 . `` This includes the phasing out of American air travel . ''\nFrom both a financial and practical standpoint , replacing planes with high-speed rail lines makes little sense . For one thing , `` high-speed rail projects cost billions and billions , '' Feigenbaum says . Consider the proposed Texas line between Dallas and Houston , which could cost as much as $ 20 billion . Both cities , notably , are in the same state , separated by less than 300 miles . Replacing air travel with high-speed rail would mean lines connecting every major city in the country , at least . `` The amount of money you 'd actually need to build these lines would be so far in the trillions , I do n't see how you would possibly get it done , '' Feigenbaum says .\nOcasio-Cortez , though , does n't seem to care about the Green New Deal 's fiscal cost . She told Business Insider last month that Modern Monetary Theory\u2014which says the government can essentially print and spend as much money as it wants , regardless of budget deficits or national debt\u2014should `` absolutely '' be `` a larger part of our conversation '' about paying for her plan .\nPutting this dubious reasoning to the side , her goal of eliminating air travel still makes no sense . `` The \u2588\u2588\u2588 why people take air travel is generally because it 's fast , '' Feigenbaum says , explaining that there are very few corridors where rail travel could realistically compete with planes . `` If you 're going across the country , '' he adds , then `` obviously high-speed rail is not going to be compatible with air travel . ''\nAnd it certainly would n't be too effective if you wanted to travel to , say , Hawaii . A high-speed rail between the West Coast and Hawaii would require underground tunneling , which would itself cost an astronomical amount . `` I ca n't think of a number that 's high enough , '' Feigenbaum says . `` You 're talking about more than trillions , I think , in order to build a line . ''\nSen. Mazie Hirono ( D\u2013Hawaii ) seems to realize the impracticality of ending air travel . `` That would be pretty hard for Hawaii , '' she said of Ocasio-Cortez 's plan , according to Fox News ' Chad Pergram .\nThere 's another issue . Truly replacing air travel with high-speed rail lines would require connecting all the countless cities in the U.S. that , while they would n't be classified as major , still have airports . Feigenbaum pointed to Casper , Wyoming , and Provo , Utah . Both have populations under 500,000 . `` Are we really going to build high-speed rail to places like [ these ] ? '' wonders Feigenbaum .\nIn fact , there are more than 5,000 public airports in the U.S . It 's hard to imagine the planning and money that would go into connecting even half of them with high-speed rail lines , or serving the hundreds of millions of people who fly in the U.S. each year . `` To suggest that it 's even remotely possible to transition our transportation system in this way , to handle not only the capacity of air travel but get near its efficiency is a pipe dream , '' says Blair .\nConsidering that California officials have proven themselves incompetent when it comes to constructing a high-speed line through that state , a similar project on a much larger scale would probably be disastrous . The California rail is `` a waste of money '' that 's `` ruining farms and highways , and will never work , '' Blair explains .\n`` That 's what Democrats want to take national , '' he adds , `` the abysmal failure of boondoggles that shackle taxpayers to the pipe dreams of socialists with no concern for its failures right here in America . ''\nOcasio-Cortez has admitted that completely eliminating air travel within the next 10 years might not be possible .\nStill , Feigenbaum suggests Ocasio-Cortez and her allies in Congress have shown their ignorance in this area . `` The folks who are proposing [ the Green New Deal ] do n't really know much about transportation , '' he says . `` It 's more designed for political purposes than it is for actual implementation .
