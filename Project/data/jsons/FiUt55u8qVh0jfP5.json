    "content": "AUSTIN \u2014 Texas state Rep. Ron Reynolds was running for his fourth term when in early 2016 he abruptly stopped reporting his finances to the state . He didn \u2019 t file another report for about two years , keeping secret the amount of money he raised during that time and the identities of those who gave it to him .\nReynolds , D-Missouri City , is one of about a hundred candidates , lobbyists and political action committee treasurers each year who fail to file mandatory disclosures of their donors and expenses , racking up thousands of dollars in fines as a result , according to an analysis by Hearst Newspapers .\nYet candidates with unpaid fines can continue to run for office and the committees can go on operating , thanks to a weak enforcement system that allows them to dodge their responsibility to the state and voters . Reynolds still owes over $ 74,000 as he runs for re-election this year .\nThe Texas Attorney General \u2019 s Office , which handles collections for the Texas Ethics Commission , since 2005 has won the right in court to collect $ 1.1 million from late filers , including Reynolds , but the office has then written off $ 800,000 as uncollectible , effectively ending attempts to financially penalize candidates and political committees .\n\u201c Campaign finance in Texas is basically a wild west , no rules system , \u201d said Anthony Gutierrez , executive director of Common Cause Texas , an advocacy group that seeks to reduce the influence of money in politics . \u201c Only in the most extreme circumstances do you see people being held accountable . \u201d\nFor subscribers : Gov . Abbott hauls in two $ 1M checks in Texas , land of unlimited political giving\nIt \u2019 s rare for office holders like Reynolds to allow their fines to pile up . Elected officials , including judges and legislators , make up a small portion of the total outstanding fines , the majority of which are owed by candidates who lost , lobbyists and PAC treasurers .\nStill , the state \u2019 s lack of enforcement could give candidates and politicians with unpaid fines little motivation to pay up or account for their fundraising in 2020 , a competitive election that could tip the scales of power in Texas for years to come . The campaign finance reports are required by law because they reveal where candidates are getting their money in a state with few limits on contributions , which has meant some have received checks as high as $ 1 million from individual donors .\nReynolds , a personal injury attorney who has been in the Legislature since 2011 , has yet to file the missing campaign reports , Texas Ethics Commission records show . Meanwhile , the attorney general \u2019 s office has gone to court seven times trying to collect fines from Reynolds since 2008 .\nThose court judgments are supposed to act as an incentive for a candidate to pay because they can inhibit a person \u2019 s ability to get a loan or lower their credit score , the attorney general \u2019 s office said .\nReynolds , however , said the lawsuits haven \u2019 t negatively impacted his credit score or affected his job as a state representative . Just one of the fines for $ 9,400 has been paid back in full ; Reynolds said he is making payments toward the rest of the debt , but he did not respond to a request that he provide proof of payment . The attorney general \u2019 s office did not respond to a request for confirmation . Reynolds has not missed reporting deadlines in the last year .\nHe said he plans to file the missing campaign finance reports next month , explaining that the fines accrued after he missed filing deadlines when his mother was in intensive care , when he was in the hospital and when he was out of the country .\nIn 2018 , Reynolds served nearly four months in jail for illegally soliciting clients for his law practice and was released in time for the beginning of the 2019 legislative session . He has been disbarred in Texas but is appealing the decision .\n\u201c My constituents appreciate the fact that I 'm very engaged and responsive to their concerns , \u201d he said in a statement . \u201c I plan to stay focused on fighting for my constituents and not distracted by old fines that I 'm already in the process of paying off . \u201d\nIn 2018 , 22 percent of people fined actually paid up\nThe attorney general \u2019 s office said it does all it can to collect the fines , by blocking elected officials from receiving reimbursements from the state or filing lawsuits when fees are hefty enough to justify the legal cost , before labeling them uncollectible . While those facing steep fines are cut off from state contracts and reimbursements , delinquent lawmakers can continue to collect their salaries and per diem checks .\nOther states such as New York , California and Florida can garnish wages , levy tax liens or even send collections agencies after debtors , but Texas regulators have none of those options . State law provides the civil courts as the only remedy for collecting unpaid fines . Once the Texas Attorney General deems fines uncollectible , the debt stays on the books and could still be paid one day , but there are no enforcement options left for the agency to take , officials said .\nDozens of lobbyists , judges and lawmakers have paid off their debts , some of which reach tens of thousands of dollars . But plenty of other candidates and officials \u2014 representing all political parties \u2014 have not .\nOf the cases closed in 2018 , about 22 percent of candidates and officials paid their fines in full . The rest were either waived by the commission or otherwise uncollectible at least in part .\nTexas Take : Get the latest news on Texas politics sent directly to your inbox every weekday\nChad Craycraft , chair of the Texas Ethics Commission , said he believes the attorney general \u2019 s office does all it can to collect .\n\u201c I have complete confidence that the attorney general \u2019 s office takes all referrals made by the Texas Ethics Commission and other state agencies seriously and after evaluating each individually , pursues the course of action that it deems is in the best interest of the State of Texas , \u201d Craycraft said .\nCandidates have several opportunities to avoid a fine levied by the ethics commission . If they fail to report campaign spending on time , candidates can request the ethics commission waive the fine after they turn in the late report .\nThat happens quite often : About 15 percent of overdue fines , or about $ 535,000 , since 2005 have been absolved by the agency after it originally referred them to the attorney general \u2019 s office for collections , records show .\nState Board of Education Board Member Georgina Perez is one of the more than 300 people whose fines were dropped in the last decade . Perez said she had a technical issue with submitting her disclosure forms that was later resolved .\nPerez said she was very concerned about having a fine on her record and dealt with the issue immediately , but even if she hadn \u2019 t , the hold on her reimbursements for board-related travel and other expenses likely would have been \u201c highly effective \u201d \u2014 especially since she has to make the 1,100-mile round trip drive from El Paso to Austin many times a year for board meetings .\nIn Florida , the state can recover unpaid fines through salary withholding , wage garnishment or referral to a collection agency , though the ethics commission \u2019 s deputy executive director Kerrie Stillman said it has not been forced to garnish wages yet .
