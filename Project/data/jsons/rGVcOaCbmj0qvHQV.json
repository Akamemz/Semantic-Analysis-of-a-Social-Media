    "content": "Judge Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in as the 114th Supreme Court justice late Saturday , just hours after the Senate voted to approve President Trump 's nominee to the nation 's highest court after a rancorous confirmation battle .\nKavanaugh was sworn in by Chief Justice John Roberts in a private ceremony , accompanied by his wife and children . The ceremonial swearing in is expected to happen on Monday evening at the White House . It means that now-Justice Kavanaugh will begin hearing cases before the court on Tuesday .\nThe Senate voted 50-48 to confirm Kavanaugh , mostly along party lines , after a weeklong FBI probe helped settle concerns among most wavering senators about the sexual assault allegations that nearly derailed his nomination and led to a dramatic second hearing . Saturday \u2019 s roll call marked the tightest successful Supreme Court confirmation vote in over 100 years , closer than even that of Clarence Thomas who similarly faced sexual misconduct allegations .\nSen. Joe Manchin , D-W.Va. , was the sole Democrat to vote \u201c yes. \u201d Sen. Lisa Murkowski , R-Alaska , was a \u201c no , \u201d but voted \u201c present \u201d as a courtesy to Sen.

We will not stop marching , we will not stop fighting , and we will vote on Election Day for leaders who share our values , \u201d Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez said in a statement .\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , said it was a `` heartbreaking day for women , girls and families across America . '' She also announced she is filing a Freedom of Information Act request so the public can view documents connected to the FBI 's background investigation into sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh .\n\u201c The conduct of the Senate Republican Majority did violence to the reputation of both the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Supreme Court . We must proceed in a judicious manner to set the record straight and ensure that this never happens again , \u201d she said .\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , brushed off criticism from Democrats and said it was `` a good day for America and an important day for the Senate . ''\n`` We stood up for the presumption of innocence , we refused to be intimidated by the mob of people coming after Republican members at their homes and hallways , '' he said .\nAt a rally in Topeka , Kansas , President Trump hailed the confirmation as a `` tremendous victory '' and slammed Democrats for their treatment of Kavanaugh during the contentious confirmation hearing .\n`` What he and his family endured at the hands of Democrats is unthinkable . In their quest for power , the radical Democrats have turned into an angry mob , you saw that today with the screaming and shouting , '' he said , referring to protests outside the Senate and Supreme Court earlier in the day .\nThe confirmation vote was all but secured Friday night when undecided Sens .
