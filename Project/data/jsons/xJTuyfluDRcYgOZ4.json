    "content": "The Hillary Clinton campaign is taking some hard knocks from liberals over its maladroit attacks on Bernie Sanders \u2019 single-payer proposal . In one sense , the knocks are well-deserved . Even if single-payer markedly lowers medical expenditures , proponents such as Larry Seidman estimate that a tax increase of at least 8 percent of GDP would likely be required to finance it . That \u2019 s a heavy political lift . It \u2019 s about as much as the entire federal income tax on individuals .\nYet as proponents rightly observe , these taxes would replace many visible and invisible ways we now provide to support a health sector that consume more than 17 percent of our economy . The experience of peer industrial democracies suggests that a well-designed single-payer system would be more humane and markedly less expensive than what we have right now .\nSuch a system would certainly be less convoluted and bureaucratically hidebound . Aggressively deploying government power to rein in prices , a well-designed single-payer system would be more fiscally disciplined , and would probably be more effective in targeting resources to best promote public health . Sanders deserves credit for noting the real virtues of a well-executed single-payer system .\nIn another way , though , Clinton 's critique raises uncomfortable questions that deserve greater attention . It \u2019 s commonplace ( though true ) to note that single-payer is beyond the current boundaries of American politics . But what if , by some miracle , liberal Democrats won comprehensive victories that created a window of opportunity in which single-payer becomes realistically possible ?\nImagine what would happen were President Bernie Sanders to sweep into office backed by a Democratic congressional majority similar to what President Obama enjoyed in 2008 . Imagine further that President Sanders were sufficiently fortunate and skilled after that victory to enact a single-payer system . I wonder how different our policy dilemmas would really be from what we now face in implementing the Affordable Care Act .\nAs I have written at length in the Journal of Health Politics , Policy , and Law ( and draw upon here ) , an American single-payer system would be more complex and kludgy than many proponents have considered or admitted . The source of these problems resides in American politics rather than the technocratic or ideological premises of our health care system . A different system operating through the same political mechanisms would produce similar complexity and kludge .\nThe pitch for single-payer is admirably simple : We cover every ( legal ) resident . We mail a Medicare card to everyone . Everyone is covered . That \u2019 s a lot easier to explain and market than it is to explain the convoluted structures of Medicaid and state marketplace plans .\nThis is also a caricature of how such a single-payer plan would be passed and how it would touch the lives of millions of Americans . Single-payer would immediately raise myriad intricate and divisive transition issues . It would potentially uproot thousands of critical arrangements President Obama , Speaker Pelosi , and Sen. Reid struggled to leave intact .\nAfter all , ACA \u2019 s sales pitch to the healthy and insured was , `` If you like your insurance , you can keep it . '' This pledge proved politically damaging when it could not be fully kept for several million people . Single-payer would be far more disruptive to even more people .\nIt \u2019 s telling that no fully articulated single-payer bill was ever drafted as an alternative to the ACA . Such a bill would have been no less complicated , and would probably have been more encyclopedic than the ACA was . A huge reform that creates millions of winners creates millions of losers , too .\nAs with ACA , the biggest winners would be relatively disorganized low-income people in greatest need of help . The potential losers would include some of the most powerful and organized constituencies in America : workers who now receive generous tax expenditures for good private coverage , and affluent people who would face large tax increases to finance a single-payer system . At least some of these constituencies would need to be accommodated in messy political bargaining to get single-payer enacted . And states would have a role to play , too , potentially replicating the messy patchwork we got with ACA reforms .\nSingle-payer would require a serious rewrite of state and federal relations in Medicaid and in many other matters . It would radically revise the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ( ERISA ) , which strongly influences the benefit practices of large employers . Single-payer would require intricate negotiation to navigate the transition from employer-based coverage . The House and Senate would be in charge of this tension , and at risk of the negotiations among key legislators and committees who hold sway .\nSingle-payer would be openly or quietly opposed by virtually the entire supply side of the medical economy .
