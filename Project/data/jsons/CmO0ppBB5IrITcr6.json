Translate this into his being the victim , not the villain , \u201d says Princeton University professor of political history Julian Zelizer in an email .\nIn recent months , President Trump seems to have turned up the volume on the subject of Russia . Critics say it is an effort to distract attention from his administration \u2019 s handling of the coronavirus epidemic . Before 8:45 a.m. on Wednesday , for instance , the president tweeted eight times about \u201c Obamagate- \u201d and five times about Michael Flynn . He tweeted only once about a COVID-19 related subject .\nMr. Mueller \u2019 s final report , issued in March 2019 , concluded that the Russian government believed it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome . Investigators did not establish that Trump campaign members conspired or coordinated with Russia in the effort .\nIn addition , Mueller investigators said that given the facts and applicable legal standards , they could not say that President Trump did not commit obstruction of justice during their probe .\n\u201c While this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime , it also does not exonerate him , \u201d the Mueller report says .\nIn the months following the report \u2019 s release , President Trump insisted that it amounted to a complete exoneration . More recently , he has pushed the idea that the real criminal conspiracy was among the investigators . As support , he has pointed to revelations about problems in the first days of the FBI \u2019 s Russia probe , including serious errors and omissions in secret applications to surveil a former Trump campaign aide .\nTop administration officials have echoed his concerns . Attorney General Barr has been especially supportive .\n\u201c I think the president has every right to be frustrated , because I think what happened to him was one of the greatest travesties in American history , \u201d Mr. Barr said in an April interview with Fox News .\nIn April 2019 , Mr. Barr tapped U.S. Attorney John Durham to examine the early days of the Russia probe , and in particular , whether there was any impropriety in the investigation . Mr. Durham \u2019 s investigation has largely proceeded in secret .\nIn April of this year , Mr. Barr said he did not expect the Justice Department would open criminal investigations into President Obama or former Vice President Joe Biden on this matter . Some critics interpreted this statement as an implicit rebuke of President Trump and his \u201c Obamagate ! \u201d tweets . The president himself said he \u201c was surprised \u201d by Mr. Barr \u2019 s remark .\nBut Mr. Durham might yet bring a criminal indictment of some sort related to the opening of the FBI \u2019 s \u201c Crossfire Hurricane \u201d probe into the Trump campaign and Russia , noted Ryan Goodman , a former Department of Defense counsel , in a Just Security piece on May 15 .\nIn particular , it \u2019 s possible he could identify a former senior official who leaked to a Washington Post reporter the classified intercept of a Dec. 29 , 2016 , phone call between Mr. Flynn and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak .\nThe leak was serious disclosure of classified material , revealing details of a phone call at the heart of the case against Mr. Flynn , and Trump critics would have a hard time criticizing an indictment .

To critics , his actions raised obvious , serious national security concerns , and the lies he told about them had serious consequences .\nMr. Flynn , a former Army lieutenant general , was an early and enthusiastic supporter of Mr. Trump \u2019 s presidential campaign , and was rewarded with the plum job of national security adviser .\nHe only lasted 24 days , a record for shortest tenure in the job . President Trump fired him following revelations that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence and other top officials about the nature of his communications during the presidential transition with Russian Ambassador Kislyak .\nIn December 2017 , he pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI and agreed to cooperate with Mr. Mueller \u2019 s investigation . Asked by agents whether he had talked about U.S. sanctions with Ambassador Kislyak and urged restraint , Mr. Flynn said no . But the agents knew better , as they had transcripts of FBI wiretaps of the Flynn-Kislyak conversations .\nMr. Flynn reiterated his guilty plea before a federal judge in December 2018 . Then in January 2020 , he asked to withdraw it , alleging among other things that he had been \u201c duped \u201d into admitting wrongdoing .\nEarlier this month , the Department of Justice abruptly reversed course , and filed a motion to dismiss the case with federal Judge Emmet Sullivan .
