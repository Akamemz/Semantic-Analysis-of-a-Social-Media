    "content": "It \u2019 s here . President Trump \u2019 s travel ban \u2014 after two executive orders , several court rulings , and a huge administration victory from the Supreme Court \u2014 is back .\nAt 8pm Eastern time on Thursday , the ban \u2014 which temporarily bars some people from getting visas if they come from Iran , Libya , Somalia , Sudan , Syria , or Yemen for the next 90 days , as well as barring an untold number of refugees for 120 days \u2014went into effect in airports around America and consular offices around the world .\nThe administration appears to be trying to avoid the chaos that plagued the first iteration of the \u201c travel ban , \u201d which was in effect for a week after getting signed in late January but was ultimately put on hold by the courts . ( The version going into effect tonight was a modified executive order signed by President Trump in March , and further modified by a Supreme Court ruling on Monday that allowed the ban to partially go into effect while the courts weigh its constitutionality . )\nThis time , the administration \u2019 s trying to set clear rules about who will be allowed to enter ( thanks to the Supreme Court \u2019 s mandate to the Trump administration on Monday ) because they have a \u201c bona fide relationship \u201d with someone or something in the US .\nMere minutes before the ban was set to go live , the State Department reversed itself to allow fiances of people in the United States to enter the country .\nAdvocacy groups are still upset by the administration \u2019 s narrow definition of \u201c bona fide \u201d family relationships ( which still excludes grandparents ) . And the government is hinting that refugees who \u2019 ve been placed with a resettlement agency won \u2019 t be allowed to come to the US unless they have close family members here \u2014 which would severely limit refugee resettlement in the US over the next 4 months .\nAnd it \u2019 s still impossible to rule out the possibility that something will go down in the airports .\nStarting at 8 pm Eastern on Thursday , US consulates and embassies around the world will no longer approve visas for people traveling on passports from Iran , Libya , Somalia , Sudan , Syria , or Yemen to come to the United States , unless those people can establish a \u201c bona fide relationship \u201d with someone or something in the US .\nA \u201c bona fide relationship \u201d can be with a business or university in the US \u2014 for example , if the person has a job offer or a conference invitation \u2014 or it can be with certain family members .\nOnly certain family members , however , will count as \u201c bona fide \u201d relationships . According to the State Department cable , applicants ( or refugees seeking to be admitted to the US ) who have a \u201c parent ( including parent-in-law ) , spouse , child , adult son or daughter , son-in-law , daughter-in-law , sibling \u201d or half sibling \u2014 or a \u201c step \u201d version of any of those relationships ( stepparent , stepchild , etc ) \u2014 in the US will be approved , because that relationship counts as \u201c bona fide. \u201d But other relationships don \u2019 t \u2014 including grandparents and grandchildren , aunts , uncles , nieces , nephews , and cousins .\nInitially , fianc\u00e9 ( e ) s of people living in the US were not considered \u201c bona fide \u201d family . But 15 minutes before the ban was supposed to go into effect Thursday , the State Department updated its FAQ to state that fianc\u00e9 ( e ) s were supposed to be granted visas .\nPeople traveling for business , meanwhile , are only going to get visas if the US government determines that they \u2019 re not just being invited to the US to circumvent the ban .\nThere are exceptions . Consular officers are supposed to grant visas to people who \u2019 d otherwise be banned in some particular circumstances \u2014 for example , if they \u2019 re in need of urgent medical care or doing business with the US government \u2014 or if the officer ( with leadership approval ) decides that denying the visa would cause undue hardship and allowing the person to come is in the US \u2019 national interest .\nAnyone who already has a valid visa as of 8 pm Eastern on Thursday is supposed to be allowed into the US , according to President Trump \u2019 s executive order .\nWhat the ban means for refugees who don \u2019 t have \u201c bona fide \u201d family members in the US according to the categories laid out by the State Department . Many advocates have argued that the Supreme Court \u2019 s ruling should permit nearly all refugees to enter the US , because refugees have to be placed with a resettlement agency before entering the country , and that should count as a \u201c bona fide \u201d relationship . But the Supreme Court didn \u2019 t specify that , and the administration doesn \u2019 t seem to be taking it that way .\nIn a press call on Thursday , a senior administration official said that \u201c the fact that a resettlement agency in the United States has provided a formal assurance for refugees seeking admission is not sufficient , in and of itself , to establish a bona fide relationship under the ruling. \u201d It \u2019 s not yet clear whether this means refugees will only be admitted if they already have close family in the US , or whether some stage in the resettlement process will count as a \u201c bona fide \u201d relationship . And all refugees who are scheduled to arrive in the US through July 6th will be able to come without incident . But after that , tens of thousands of refugees , and the resettlement agencies in the US that employ people to help them , remain under a cloud of uncertainty \u2014 and it \u2019 s not looking good .\nWhether Customs and Border Protection agents will cite the ban to detain anyone entering the US . Senior administration officials assured the press on Thursday that people with valid visas would be allowed into the US once the ban went into effect Thursday night . And because no one \u2019 s allowed to board a US-bound plane without a valid visa , there shouldn \u2019 t be any problems for anyone landing in the US . However , the overly-aggressive and inconsistent implementation of the first version of this executive order , back in January , has made many lawyers and advocates worry that CBP agents might be overly aggressive , or poorly trained , in implementing this guidance . Pro bono lawyers are already stationed at many international airports around the US , hoping to monitor how people coming in are being treated .\nHow generous consular officers are going to be in granting waivers for \u201c undue hardship . \u201d\nHow transparent consular officers will be in denying visas \u2014 and CBP officers will be in denying admission to people arriving in the US . The US government can deny a visa for almost any reason , and it \u2019 s near-impossible to challenge a visa denial . People who are from the 6 affected countries but have a \u201c bona fide relationship \u201d could still be denied visas for other reasons . And even if someone has a valid visa and comes to the US , the government ( through CBP ) has wide latitude to stop him from formally entering.If such denials are common , it might raise the suspicion that the government is using other criteria for visa denial and admissibility as a backdoor way to expand the scope of the ban .\nWhether US courts are going to agree with the Trump administration \u2019 s interpretation of \u201c bona fide \u201d family members . US immigration law has always made distinctions among different types of family relationships . But the Supreme Court \u2019 s ruling didn \u2019 t make any distinctions among degrees of relationship when it set the standard for a \u201c bona fide \u201d relationship on Monday , and it \u2019 s not clear whether the courts will agree that it \u2019 s fair to say a grandmother doesn \u2019 t have a \u201c bona fide \u201d relationship with her grandchild . It is a near-certainty that , as soon as visas start getting denied under the ban , the US-based relatives will claim the Trump administration has violated the terms of the Supreme Court \u2019 s order by implementing the ban even when it wasn \u2019 t supposed to , and there will probably be a profusion of lawsuits . The question is whether federal courts will side with families or with the government , and whether \u2014 with the Supreme Court out for the summer \u2014 various courts around the country will come to different conclusions and create a patchwork of interpretations of the ban .\nUPDATE : This article has been updated to include details from the full text of the State Department cable , and from reports of a press call with senior administration officials .",
