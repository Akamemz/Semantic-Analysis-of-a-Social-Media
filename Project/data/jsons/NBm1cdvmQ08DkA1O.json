    "content": "When Louisville , Kentucky , Detective Joshua Jaynes applied for the no-knock search warrant that led to Breonna Taylor 's death last March , he said he expected to find `` illegal narcotics or paraphernalia , '' `` proceeds from drug trafficking , '' or `` paperwork that may be a record of narcotics sales or that may indicate the transport , concealment or sales of narcotics . '' But after three plainclothes officers broke into Taylor 's apartment around 12:40 a.m. on March 13 and shot the unarmed 26-year-old woman dead , they did not find any of that . Why did they think they would ?\nThat question goes to the heart of the legal justification for the raid , during which Tayor 's boyfriend fired a shot at the cops , whom he mistook for armed robbers , hitting one of them in the leg . According to a wrongful-death lawsuit filed by Taylor 's family , the officers responded by `` spray [ ing ] gunfire into the residence with a total disregard for the value of human life . '' Taylor 's relatives say police fired more than 20 rounds , at least eight of which struck Taylor , an African-American EMT and aspiring nurse with no criminal record . Two days ago , Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said the city will try to fire Detective Brett Hankison , who is accused of `` blindly '' shooting 10 rounds into Taylor 's apartment .\nThe tactics the cops used during the raid have generated justified outrage locally and nationwide . But the case , which has been frequently cited in the protests against police brutality triggered by George Floyd 's death , also highlights the problem of inadequate judicial oversight , which allows operations like this one to proceed based on meager evidence .\nWhen he applied for a warrant to search Taylor 's apartment , Jaynes also asked for four other warrants : one for a suspected `` trap house '' allegedly operated by Jamarcus Glover and Adrian Walker ( no relation to Kenneth Walker ) at 2424 Elliott Avenue , two for vacant homes near that address , and one for a suspected stash house on West Muhammad Ali Boulevard . USA Today notes that Jefferson County Circuit Judge Mary Shaw approved all five warrants `` within 12 minutes . ''\nIn his affidavit , Jaynes described substantial evidence that Glover and Adrian Walker were selling drugs . He noted pending drug charges against both men ; his observation of `` 15-20 vehicles '' going to and from the house at 2424 Elliott Avenue `` within a short period of time '' ; surveillance camera footage showing Glover dropping and concealing `` a large , blue cylinder-shaped object '' next to rocks near that address ; video of both suspects going back and forth between the stash and the house ; a December 30 search that found `` narcotics and firearms '' in the house ; and a January 2 traffic stop for speeding that discovered `` a small amount of marijuana '' and `` a large undetermined amount of US currency located in the center console '' of a red 2017 Dodge Charger driven by Adrian Walker .\nBy contrast , the evidence implicating Taylor , and thereby justifying searches of her apartment and her white 2016 Chevrolet Impala , was slight . Jaynes said he had seen Glover 's Dodge Charger `` make frequent trips '' between the Elliott Avenue house and Taylor 's apartment complex on Springfield Drive , which is about 10 miles away . He also reported that he had observed Taylor 's car parked in front of the Elliott Avenue house `` on different occasions . '' On January 16 , Jaynes said , he had seen Glover pick up `` a suspected USPS package '' at Taylor 's apartment . Jaynes also claimed he had `` verified through a US Postal Inspector '' that Glover was `` receiving packages '' there .\nTaylor had dated Glover , and they remained friendly , which would explain the contacts that Jaynes observed . In a May 15 interview with WDRB , the local Fox TV station , Tony Gooden , a U.S. postal inspector in Louisville , said city police had never consulted with his office about the packages Glover received at Taylor 's apartment . Gooden added that a different law enforcement agency , which he declined to identify , had asked about the packages in January , when his office concluded `` there 's no packages of interest going there . '' My former \u2588\u2588\u2588 colleague Radley Balko , writing at The Washington Post , reports that `` a source with knowledge of the case has since told me that the packages contained clothes and shoes . ''\nBased on Jaynes ' affidavit , Judge Shaw had no way of knowing about the relationship between Taylor and Glover , the contents of the packages , or the conclusion by the postal inspector 's office that there was nothing suspicious about them . But if she had spent more time reviewing Jaynes ' warrant applications , she might have thought to ask whether there could be an innocent explanation for the interactions between Taylor and Glover , which apparently had nothing to do with drugs . Although Jaynes presented compelling evidence of drug dealing by Glover , who was arrested along with Adrian Walker the same night that police killed Taylor , the detective 's inferences about her were based purely on guilt by association .\n`` There was clearly no probable cause to believe drugs were being dealt from her apartment , and no probable cause that Breonna or her boyfriend were doing anything illegal , '' says Daniel Klein , a former Albuquerque police sergeant who writes about law enforcement issues , in an email . `` Yet the assistant district attorney and the [ circuit ] court judge not only approved the warrant\u2026they approved it to be a no-knock warrant executed in the middle of the night ! ''\nBalko argues that the no-knock warrant was illegal because Jaynes did not cite any information specific to Taylor that would justify dispensing with the usual knock-and-announce requirement . Instead Jaynes offered boilerplate that is commonly seen in applications for no-knock warrants : `` Affiant is requesting a No-Knock entry to the premises due to the nature of how these drug traffickers operate . These drug traffickers have a history of attempting to destroy evidence , have cameras on the location that compromise Detectives once an approach to the dwelling is made , and a have history of fleeing from law enforcement . '' Yet none of that was true of Taylor\u2014another crucial point that a more diligent judge might have noticed .\nDespite the no-knock warrant , the officers who raided Taylor 's apartment say they did announce themselves\u2014a claim that Kenneth Walker and 16 neighbors disputed . But even if the cops did identify themselves while banging on Taylor 's door for 30 to 45 seconds ( according to Walker ) before breaking it in with a battering ram , that information could easily have been missed by people awakened in the middle of the night . The evidence indicates that Walker\u2014who reported a break-in during phone calls to police , his mother , and Taylor 's mother\u2014did not realize the armed men invading the apartment were police officers . Walker was initially charged with the attempted murder of a police officer , but prosecutors dropped that charge last month .\nThis month the Louisville City Council unanimously approved an ordinance that bans no-knock raids . As Balko notes , however , there is often little practical difference between no-knock raids and knock-and-announce raids , especially when warrants are served while residents are sleeping and police breach the door as they identify themselves or immediately afterward . Still , there is a legal distinction between the two kinds of searches , and the Supreme Court has said no-knock entries require something more than general observations about how certain kinds of suspects have been known to behave , although it also has said violations of that rule do not invalidate the evidence police collect .\n`` When I was a detective , the D.A . and judges would actually read the warrant , '' says Klein , who handled many drug investigations during his 20 years with the Albuquerque Police Department . `` They took it seriously . There were several times I was told to go back and get more probable cause . That was the right thing to do . Having a D.A . and judge sign/approve a warrant is a check and balance for our system . ''\nThe FBI is investigating the raid that killed Taylor . According to the lawsuit by Taylor 's family , Hankison , the officer Fischer wants to fire , has a `` use of force history '' that is `` pages long , documenting dozens of situations where he has sent citizens to the hospital for injuries from being tased , pepper sprayed and struck repeatedly in the nose and eyes . '' The Louisville Metro Police Department recently announced that Detective Jaynes had been placed on `` administrative reassignment '' until lingering questions about `` how and why the search warrant was approved '' are resolved .",
