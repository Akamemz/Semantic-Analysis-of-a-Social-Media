Fort Hood . Tucson . Aurora . Sandy Hook . And now , the Washington Navy Yard . And these mass shootings occur against a backdrop of daily tragedies , as an epidemic of gun violence tears apart communities across America -- from the streets of Chicago to neighborhoods not far from here .\nAnd yet , here in the United States , after the round-of-clock coverage on cable news , after the heartbreaking interviews with families , after all the speeches and all the punditry and all the commentary , nothing happens . Alongside the anguish of these American families , alongside the accumulated outrage so many of us feel , sometimes I fear there \u2019 s a creeping resignation that these tragedies are just somehow the way it is , that this is somehow the new normal .\nWe can \u2019 t accept this . As Americans bound in grief and love , we must insist here today there is nothing normal about innocent men and women being gunned down where they work . There is nothing normal about our children being gunned down in their classrooms . There is nothing normal about children dying in our streets from stray bullets .\nNo other advanced nation endures this kind of violence -- none . Here in America , the murder rate is three times what it is in other developed nations . The murder rate with guns is ten times what it is in other developed nations . And there is nothing inevitable about it . It comes about because of decisions we make or fail to make . And it falls upon us to make it different .\nBut we Americans are not an inherently more violent people than folks in other countries . We 're not inherently more prone to mental health problems . The main difference that sets our nation apart , what makes us so susceptible to so many mass shootings , is that we don \u2019 t do enough -- we don \u2019 t take the basic , common-sense actions to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and dangerous people . What 's different in America is it 's easy to get your hands on gun -- and a lot of us know this . But the politics are difficult , as we saw again this spring . And that \u2019 s sometimes where the resignation comes from -- the sense that our politics are frozen and that nothing will change .\nWell , I can not accept that . I do not accept that we can not find a common-sense way to preserve our traditions , including our basic Second Amendment freedoms and the rights of law-abiding gun owners , while at the same time reducing the gun violence that unleashes so much mayhem on a regular basis . And it may not happen tomorrow and it may not happen next week , it may not happen next month -- but it will happen . Because it 's the change that we need , and it 's a change overwhelmingly supported by the majority of Americans .\nBy now , though , it should be clear that the change we need will not come from Washington , even when tragedy strikes Washington . Change will come the only way it ever has come , and that \u2019 s from the American people . So the question now is not whether , as Americans , we care in moments of tragedy . Clearly , we care . Our hearts are broken -- again . And we care so deeply about these families . But the question is , do we care enough ?\nGot that ? If you do n't support new `` common sense '' gun control measures , you just do n't care about preventing mass shootings . And with all due respect , mass shootings are not the new normal and are not on the rise as President Obama would like the country to believe . Violence in the streets of Chicago between rival gangs is normal . Mass shootings , are not .\nLet 's refresh what happened last week : Mad man Aaron Alexis , who was hearing aliens talk to him , purchased a shotgun legally at a Virginia gun store after passing two background checks .
