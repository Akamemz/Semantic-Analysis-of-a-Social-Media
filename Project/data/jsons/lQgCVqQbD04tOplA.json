He did n't plan on becoming a central figure in a test of one of America \u2019 s foundational political institutions .\nBut then he was chosen as a member of the Electoral College , the creaky mechanism , established by the Constitution , that actually names the nation \u2019 s chief executive .\nAs an official elector for Colorado in the 2016 presidential election , Mr. Baca tried to cast his ballot for someone other than Hillary Clinton , who won the state \u2019 s popular vote . Election officials replaced him , citing state law .\nSo he became party to a federal lawsuit meant to establish the bounds of electors \u2019 freedom . An appeals court ruled in his favor last August . The issue could soon land in the Supreme Court , as 22 states have joined Colorado in urging high court justices to review the 10th Circuit appeals court decision .\nThe issue arises at a time when the Electoral College is already under scrutiny . In two of the past five elections , the candidate who lost the national popular vote has won the presidency , due to unequal distribution of electors among the states .\nWith a likely contentious 2020 election looming , states now want clarity on the so-called \u201c faithless elector \u201d question . Can individual electors vote for whomever they think best , or must they vote for the candidate state voters choose ? The answer could affect the stability of the U.S. system in a close election \u2013 and perhaps the perceived legitimacy of the Electoral College itself .\n\u201c The basic situation is that the Supreme Court has never ruled about whether states can restrain the freedom of electors , \u201d says Alexander Keyssar , the author of the forthcoming book , \u201c Why Do We Still Have the Electoral College ? \u201d and a Harvard University history professor .\nFrom the beginning , the Electoral College was not a meticulously crafted plan . At the Constitutional Convention the Founders of the U.S. appointed a special committee to deal with a thorny problem : how to select a president .\n\u201c It was called the Committee on Unfinished Parts , \u201d says Professor Keyssar . \u201c The committee came up with the design of the Electoral College kind of at the last minute , just before they were adjourning . \u201d\nThe design was , in essence , a midpoint between direct election of the nation \u2019 s chief executive by eligible voters , and selection by Congress . Voters would pick elite citizens , known as electors , who in turn would actually choose the person they thought best for the job .\nIt was the system that best preserved the compromises that had already been made about representation and power in Congress , says Professor Keyssar .\nAnd while the Founders came to a solution in the summer of 1787 , after the retirement of President George Washington , the creation of parties caused dissension in the original Electoral College system .\n\u201c Not long after it was created , \u201d says Professor Keyssar , \u201c the system malfunctioned . \u201d\nUnder the original system , the top two electoral vote recipients were elected president and vice president . This created problems . In 1796 , members of different parties became president and vice president . In the next election , in 1800 , members of the same party received the same number of electoral votes .\n\u201c The 12th Amendment emerged out of that crisis , \u201d says Professor Keyssar , of the election of 1800 .
