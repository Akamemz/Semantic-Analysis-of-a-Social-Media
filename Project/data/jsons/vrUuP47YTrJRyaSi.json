    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) After more than seven years of campaign pledges -- and 42 days since their initial effort failed in epic fashion -- House Republicans now say they have the votes to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act .\nHere 's what to watch Thursday and how they got to this point .\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy explicitly says yes . House leaders have made crystal clear nothing would be scheduled for a floor vote until they had 216 votes . So do they have 216 votes ? Well , here 's a sampling of GOP aides after the announcement last night .\nHere 's the reality : In situations like this , in votes this close , leadership relies heavily on members who make clear they 'd really rather not vote for this bill , but they 'll be there if leaders need them . By all accounts , on Thursday , leaders are going to need them .\nSo while Republicans are n't going into this vote with 216 firm , happy , `` yes '' votes , they have a handful of members who have given commitments that they 'll be there if they need them . And that , based on the decision to green light the vote Wednesday night , makes them comfortable enough .\nWhy are they voting now , without an updated Congressional Budget Office score , less than 24 hours after the final amendment text was posted ?\nBecause they think they have the votes , and when you have the votes , you vote .\nPretty good adage to go by on Capitol Hill : plan beats no plan , votes beat no votes .\nTranslation : no matter how flawed , something officially on paper , in legislative text , will win the day over some amorphous perfect policy proposal . Similarly , something that can get 216 votes beats something that ca n't .\nSeems obvious , but that 's really the explanation . House leaders are keenly aware that the longer this hangs out there , the less likely it is they 'll gain votes . In fact , as interest groups , town halls , the opposition gets a hold of things , it 's more likely they 'd hemorrhage them . So despite not knowing how many people this updated plan would cover , or how much it would cost ( or , in this case , cut from the deficit ) , they 're going to the floor . Votes beats no votes .\nOn the policy ? No . While GOP policy staff says explicitly they believe the $ 8 billion added to the bill Wednesday is enough to address any concerns raised by states opting out of Obamacare 's pre-existing conditions price protections , there are no shortage of policy analysts and Democrats who vigorously dispute that .\nBut on the momentum ? Without question . It 's tough to overstate what flipping , in such a public way at the White House , Reps. Billy Long and Fred Upton did for the prospects of this bill . Leadership had run into a brick wall . They were n't going to get the votes . They were staring 2.0 ( or 3.0 ? ) in the face . Flipping two very high profile `` no '' votes , and doing so with a proposal that ostensibly addresses the core of the concerns that have plagued the new proposal up to that point ( giving states the ability to opt out of the price protections in Obamacare ) , was a very big deal .\nJUST WATCHED Spicer responds to Kimmel 's monologue Replay More Videos ...

It gave the appearance that the train was moving and it was time to get on board . It forced the hands of moderates who were keeping their powder dry . It got them to a vote .\n`` It gave our guys a clear-cut reason to get to yes , '' one senior GOP aide told CNN .\nIt 's not homogenous , but for several dozen or so members over the past two days , it essentially comes down to this : the price of doing nothing outweighs the price of doing something that could be politically very unpopular .\nThis has , believe it or not , long been the argument leaders have made to their members : you campaigned on this .
