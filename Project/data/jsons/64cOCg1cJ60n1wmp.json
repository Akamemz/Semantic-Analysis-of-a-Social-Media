The boycott coincides with a public pressure campaign led by Joe Biden and other top Democrats to press Facebook to enforce stricter control over President Trump \u2019 s postings .\nBut many of these companies\u2014including Coca-Cola , Pepsi , Adidas , and Reebok\u2014have been regular advertisers on VK , a popular Russian media website used by many white supremacists and neo-Nazis who have been banned from Facebook . Several of these companies continue to have a marketing presence on the Russian website , raising questions about their recent concern about `` hate speech '' on social media sites .\nVK \u2019 s popularity among white supremacists and neo-Nazis has been documented for years by media outlets and watchdog groups .\nEven as they remain mum on VK 's laissez-faire attitude toward online hate speech , major companies have pulled ads from Facebook for not policing speech on its own site .\n`` Racist , discriminatory , and hateful online content have no place in our brand or in society , '' Reebok and Adidas said in a statement last week . `` As we focus on better practices within our company and communities to ensure lasting change in the fight against racism , Adidas and Reebok will also pause advertising on Facebook and Instagram globally throughout July .
