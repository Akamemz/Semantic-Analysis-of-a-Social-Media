    "content": "While the Republicans easily took the Senate in 2014 , they do not have the same advantage in the 2016 election cycle , according to political analyst Charlie Cook.The Senate seats Republicans won in the 2014 midterm elections were made to order : there were seven Democratic senators who were from states that former presidential candidate Mitt Romney won handily in 2012 , an unpopular president to run against , and very few of their own seats that they needed to defend , Cook wrote in a report for the National Journal . That will not be the case in 2016 , he says.Republicans have 24 seats that will need to be defended , while Democrats only have 10 . All 10 Democratic Senate seats are all in states that President Barack Obama won in 2012 , and seven states that are held by Republicans.Those states are Florida , Illinois , Iowa , New Hampshire , Ohio , Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.One silver lining for Republicans is that the Senate seats up for re-election in blue states were not won by Obama by margins that were as wide as the red states won by Romney , where Democrats were up for re-election in 2014.The reddest state with a Democratic senator up for re-election in 2014 was West Virginia , which Romney won by 27 points in 2012 . By contrast , the bluest state up for re-election with a Republican senator is Illinois , which Obama won by 17 points.Another silver lining for the GOP is that not all states with Republican senators up for re-election that were won by Obama in 2012 are necessarily competitive.For example , it is very unlikely that Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley will lose in Iowa , even though the president won the Hawkeye State by 6 points in 2012.In addition , the competitiveness of the other states will depend on who the Democratic challengers are.Democrats and Republicans may break even on open seats up for re-election \u2014 the Democrats have three open seats with two that are in deep blue states , while the Republicans have two open seats , with only one that is considered competitive.If Democrats want to reclaim the majority in the Senate , they will need to pick up four seats if a Democrat wins the presidential election , and five , if they do n't .",
