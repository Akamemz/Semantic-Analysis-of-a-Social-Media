You think the country has gone to \u201c hell in a handbasket \u201d under the current administration and party leadership .\nAnd then you get a direct mail piece , or an email , or see an ad on the web that promises change by supporting candidates who embrace your ideals .\nHopeful and excited to learn that there are organizations willing to fight for what you think will \u201c fix this country , \u201d you grab your credit card and fire off a donation , confident you have contributed to a worthwhile cause . If only it were so !\nThe reality may well be far from what you believe , and have a right to expect ; in fact , you may be sickened to learn the truth about how little of your money actually goes to directly or indirectly supporting candidates and their campaigns .\nThis article is not a piece of commentary about beliefs or ideologies . Airing concerns openly can be constructive , civil debate can be productive , and incumbency shouldn \u2019 t equate to job security .\nThis article is about the hijacking of a movement that started in 2009 by the modern equivalent of the \u201c Old West Snake Oil Salesman. \u201d Slick , fast-talking , and capable of whipping a crowd into a frenzy , they travel from town to town peddling their promises of \u201c change . \u2019\nThe problem is evidence indicates some Tea Party groups care far less about your ideals and far more about your money\u2014taking it and making it their own . They \u2019 re an ideological Ponzi scheme ; they use donations to generate more donations , by creating sensationalistic ad campaigns to persuade donors they \u2019 re getting value , and to scare or guilt them , and new donors , into sending more donations .\nHere are five very recognizable organizations that spend vastly more on fundraising efforts than on support for any candidate .\nThe charts , above and below , were created using actual values from the FEC financial reports filed by the Tea Party Leadership Fund , Tea Party Patriots , Madison Project , Sarah Palin \u2019 s PAC , and the Tea Party Express ; from January 1 , 2013 through June 30 , 2014 . To be clear , these numbers are exactly what each organization reported without manipulation or modification .\nFrom the \u201c best of the worst \u201d to the \u201c worst of the worst \u201d \u2014here are the amounts received and then spent on operations ( like administrative costs , consultants , fundraising , online expenses , professional fees and travel ) . Here too are the amounts contributed either directly ( contributions ) or indirectly ( independent expenditures ) to candidates , for the five organizations .\nAlso shown are the ( paltry ) sums spent by each organization on candidates and campaigns . Bear in mind the ( alleged ) focus for these groups in the 2014 cycle is on regaining a GOP Senate majority .\nTotal receipts were $ 4,862,790 , with expenses of $ 4,054,288 and $ 650,260 benefiting candidates ; that \u2019 s 87 percent on expenses and 13 percent to candidates . Senate spending has been slight , while markedly almost $ 300,000 has been spent specifically in opposition to Speaker John Boehner .\nTotal receipts were $ 10,659,371 , with expenses of $ 9,263,753 and $ 1,027,354 benefiting candidates . That \u2019 s 90 percent on expenses and 10 percent to candidates . The Mississippi race was conspicuously the largest investment the Tea Party Patriots made , with almost $ 600,000 spent in opposition to Thad Cochran , and more than $ 200,000 in support of Chris McDaniel . When pushing out just 10 percent to candidates , the rationale for dropping more than three-fourths of that trifling amount on a single race calls into question their political savvy , as well as it highlights their poor fiscal management .\nTotal receipts were $ 3,801,897 , with expenses of $ 3,675,432 and $ 326,810 benefiting candidates . That \u2019 s 91 percent on expenses and 9 percent to candidates . Mitch McConnell drew the financial ire of the Madison Project with more than $ 50,000 spent in opposition to the Senate minority leader .
