( Joshua Roberts/Reuters )\nEnough is enough : It 's long past time for Congress to reclaim its constitutional war-making power .\nNancy Pelosi complains that the Trump administration \u2019 s decision to assassinate Iranian military leader Qasem Soleimani was \u201c provocative and disproportionate \u201d and that it \u201c risks provoking further dangerous escalation of violence. \u201d Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders also have denounced the killing .\nSpecifically , Pelosi says the action was taken \u201c without an authorization for use of military force against Iran. \u201d But the airstrike happened in the Iraqi capital , Baghdad , not in Iran .
