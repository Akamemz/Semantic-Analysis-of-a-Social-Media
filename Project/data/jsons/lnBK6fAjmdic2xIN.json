Gen. Michael Flynn .\nThe sense in the intelligence community , experts say , is that the president disparages the purveyors of information he doesn \u2019 t like . His dismissal of the 17 agencies that make up the nation \u2019 s intelligence community has been repeated and very public .\nMcMaster \u2019 s appointment could send a reassuring signal to the intelligence community . But going forward , much still relies on Trump himself .\nHe does not need to be an inside-the-Beltway wonk . At one point , President Reagan read only two daily intel briefings in a year .
