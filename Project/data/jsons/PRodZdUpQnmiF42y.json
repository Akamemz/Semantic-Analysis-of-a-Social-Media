Such a move would mean roughly all of China 's exports to the US would be subject to new duties .\nThe Chinese commerce ministry said it would impose its tariffs from 24 September - the date the US duties come into effect - but at lower rates than previously expected .\nIt will place an additional 5 % in duty on US products including smaller aircraft , computers and textiles , and an extra 10 % on goods such as chemicals , meat , wheat and wine .\nBy contrast , the US duties will apply to almost 6,000 items , making them the biggest round of trade tariffs yet from Washington .\nThey will affect handbags , rice and textiles , although some items such as smart watches and high chairs have been exempted .\nThey will start at 10 % and increase to 25 % from the start of next year unless the two countries agree a deal .\nOn Monday Mr Trump said the latest round of tariffs was in response to China 's `` unfair trade practices '' .\n`` We have been very clear about the type of changes that need to be made , and we have given China every opportunity to treat us more fairly .
