    "content": "The Republican Party let out a collective sigh of relief when Steve King\u2014a soon-to-be-former Iowa congressman known for his racist and nativist rhetoric\u2014lost his re-election primary in early June . But Republicans are still in a bind . In a partisan political climate that has sown the seeds for fringe candidates to win elections , the GOP is struggling to distance itself from conspiracy-mongering nominees without surrendering key districts to Democratic opponents .\nMuch of this can be traced to the QAnon conspiracy theory . Back in 2016 , \u201c Pizzagate \u201d gained national attention when a man who believed that Hillary Clinton and John Podesta were running a child-trafficking ring out of the Comet Ping Pong pizza restaurant in Washington , D.C. , went into the establishment and fired a rifle .\nNo one was hurt , and the outlandish claims were quickly debunked . But the vile conspiracy theory didn \u2019 t totally die . It lingered in dark corners of the internet . And then in 2017 , an anonymous user named Q\u2014self-dubbed for his alleged Q level security clearance\u2014took the reins and began posting claims that Clinton would be arrested , adding other allegedly classified intel about her on a public messaging board called \u201c 4chan. \u201d Mesmerized by Q \u2019 s cryptic clues ( which were , in reality , baseless rumors ) , anonymous users began obsessively tracking his posts and the QAnon movement took hold .\nAccording to conspiracy theory expert and University of Miami professor Joseph Oscinski , Q adopted the Pizzagate theory , \u201c predicting that Donald Trump would be victorious in the battle against the satanic , pedophile , child sex trafficking deep state. \u201d Anons believe \u201c that imminently the \u2018 Great Awakening \u2019 is going to happen in which all of the elites who have been engaged in these evil activities are going to be exposed for the evildoers they are , and shipped down to Guantanamo and summarily hung for their crimes . \u201d\nIt sounds far-fetched , like the plot of a bad movie . But now , in 2020 several dozen GOP candidates who align themselves with QAnon have run or are running for Congress . Some have snuck onto the ballot in districts where Democrats dominate and the GOP invests few resources in recruiting candidates . Most have lost primaries and won \u2019 t be on the ballot in the fall .\nBut GOP primary candidates Lauren Boebert , Marjorie Greene , and Jo Rae Perkins have won the hearts of Republican voters in their states . While Perkins secured a Senate primary victory in Oregon and Boebert ousted a Trump-backed incumbent in Colorado \u2019 s 3rd District primary , Greene is well on her way to win a House GOP primary runoff in Georgia . Laura Loomer\u2014a Republican primary candidate in Florida \u2019 s 21st District\u2014doesn \u2019 t endorse QAnon , but her provocative and bizarre behavior is problematic for other reasons .\nTogether , they represent a growing problem for Republican leaders : What do you do when your voters choose candidates who espouse fringe , sometimes crazy views ? The answer , at least so far ? It depends .\nQAnon \u2019 s Oregon contender , Jo Rae Perkins , has no realistic shot at beating her Democratic incumbent , Sen. Jeff Merkley . But she won nearly 200,000 votes in her GOP primary\u2014earning almost 50 percent of the vote in a four-person race\u2014and she has garnered national headlines for some of her bolder proclamations . Lauren Boebert and Marjorie Greene , however , have a real chance at winning the general election in each of their districts . Although a few Republican lawmakers have publicly condemned their campaigns , others have remained silent on the matter or gone so far as to offer endorsements .\nIf QAnon sounds like gibberish to you , polls show you \u2019 re not alone . A Pew Research poll from March 2020 shows that only 3 percent of Americans know \u201c a lot \u201d about the theory , whereas 76 percent of those polled know \u201c nothing at all. \u201d But the movement still has a huge following on social media platforms , especially Twitter and YouTube , where some accounts boast hundreds of thousands of followers .\nQAnon \u2019 s doomsday flair has even captured the attention of fringe churches , including Omega Kingdom Ministry , which regularly interprets Q drops through a biblical lens . Its pastor , Russ Wagner\u2014who sports a long beard , bears a striking resemblance to KFC \u2019 s Colonel Sanders , and preaches in front of an American flag backdrop\u2014regularly live-streams YouTube sermons to the channel \u2019 s 5.4 thousand subscribers . The church is also affiliated with \u201c Home Congregations , \u201d a site with extremely disturbing videos narrated by a woman with an ambiguous accent , who warns against Satan-worshipping pedophiles in the Democratic establishment and beyond .\nAlthough QAnon \u2019 s following is just a small part of the dark web , what it lacks in reach it makes up for in intensity , resulting in a groundswell of support for certain fringe candidates .\nLauren Boebert is the latest QAnon conspiracy sympathizer to inch toward Congress after beating her Trump-backed incumbent opponent , Rep. Scott Tipton , by 9 points in Colorado \u2019 s 3rd District Republican primary . President Trump endorsed Tipton the day before the runoff , but he was quick to congratulate Boebert on \u201c a really great win ! \u201d on Twitter . She even snagged a congratulatory endorsement from former deputy prime minister of Italy , Matteo Salvani , a neo-nationalist populist , following her win .\n\u201c This is a Republican seat and will remain a Republican seat as Nancy Pelosi and senior House Democrats continue peddling their radical conspiracy theories and pushing their radical cancel culture , \u201d said National Republican Congressional Committee chairman Tom Emmer in a statement .\nWith a Twitter bio that proclaims \u201c Running in Colorado \u2019 s 3rd to get rid of RINOs , \u201d Boebert will face off Democratic primary winner Diane Mitsch Bush\u2014who lost to Tipton in 2018\u2014in the general election . In a reliably Republican district that Trump won by a 12 point margin in 2016 , Mitsch Bush \u2019 s progressive agenda will likely leave Boebert smooth sailing to November \u2019 s general election .\n\u201c Colorado deserves a fighter who will stand up for freedom , who believes in America and who is willing to take on all the left-wing lunatics who are trying so hard to ruin our country , \u201d Boebert said in a press release after her primary win . Boebert gained national recognition at a Beto O \u2019 Rourke rally in September 2019 when she told the former presidential candidate , \u201c Hell no , you won \u2019 t take our guns , \u201d while sporting a glock on her hip . The comment landed her a Fox News appearance the following December .\nA die-hard Second Amendment defender who hails from Rifle , Colorado , Boebert owns Shooter \u2019 s Grill , where she encourages her staff to open-carry while serving customers . She also recently defied Colorado \u2019 s stay-at-home order by reopening her restaurant in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic , which was met by a temporary suspension of her restaurant license by the county .\nWhen pressed on her knowledge of QAnon on the \u201c Steel Truth \u201d show in May , she said , \u201c I am familiar with that . And , so , that \u2019 s more my mom \u2019 s thing . She \u2019 s a little fringe . I try to uh , I just try to keep things on track and positive . I am very familiar with it though . \u201d\n\u201c Everything I heard of Q \u2014 I hope that this is real because it only means America is getting stronger and better , and people are returning to conservative values , and that 's what I am for , \u201d she added . The conspiracy \u201c is only motivating and encouraging and bringing people together , stronger , and if this is real , then it could be really great for our country . \u201d\nIf Boebert offered only a halting embrace of the QAnon conspiracies , Marjorie Greene has shown no such hesitancy . And she \u2019 s currently a favorite to end up in Congress .\nLike Boebert , Greene has captured attention for her brash , own-the-libs campaign strategy , and is expected to win Georgia \u2019 s fourteenth district seat in the general election . After winning a June 9 primary with nearly twice the number of votes as the runner-up , Greene will be facing Dr. John Cowan in the next primary on August 11 .\nGreene uploaded a video in 2017 in which she declared , \u201c Q is a patriot , we know that for sure , but we do not know who Q is. \u201d She proceeded to say , \u201c but I \u2019 m going to tell you about it , because I think it \u2019 s something worth listening to and paying attention to , \u201d adding that \u201c many of the things that he has given clues about and talked about on 4chan and other forums have really proven to be true . \u201d\nThe rest of the nearly 30-minute video\u2014which is still up as of today\u2014consists of Greene unspooling outlandish conspiracy theories , one of her favorites being Hillary Clinton \u2019 s alleged sacrifice of a chicken in her backyard to the ancient Canaanite deity Moloch . After explaining Q \u2019 s prophetic Great Awakening in which deep state Democrats will be held accountable for their sins , Greene says \u201c I really truly pray that this is true . \u201d\n\u201c We know cults are real and we know real evil exists , but it hides in the darkness , \u201d she warns , \u201c because it doesn \u2019 t wan na get caught , because when Satanic worshippers and real evil comes out and it \u2019 s pulled out into the light it can \u2019 t survive , it just can \u2019 t survive . \u201d\n\u201c Now , there \u2019 s a once in a lifetime opportunity to take this global cabal of Satan worshipping pedophiles out , and I think we have the president to do it , so I \u2019 m very excited about that \u201d she says with a smile .\nMore recently , Politico uncovered recordings in which Greene said African Americans \u201c are held slaves to the Democratic Party \u201d and that she would feel proud to see Confederate monuments if she were black because they demonstrate the progress American has made since the Civil War . \u201c I know a ton of white people that are as lazy and sorry and probably worse than black people , \u201d Greene said on the topic of black unemployment . \u201c And that has everything to do with their bad choices and their personal responsibility . That is not a skin-color issue . \u201d\nShe called the 2018 House midterms \u201c an Islamic invasion of our government \u201d \u2014clearly alluding to the victories by Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib\u2014and said that \u201c anyone that is a Muslim that believes in Sharia law does not belong in our government . \u201d\nDrew Florio , a spokesman for House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy , said \u201c These comments are appalling and Leader McCarthy has no tolerance for them. \u201d Reps. Liz Cheney ( R-Wyoming ) and Steve Scalise ( R-Louisiana ) are among other key Republicans who have denounced her campaign . The National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Chris Pack said NRCC Chairman Tom Emmer is \u201c personally disgusted by this rhetoric and condemns it in the strongest possible terms . \u201d\nGeorgia Reps. Austin Scott , Buddy Carter , and Drew Ferguson have publicly endorsed Greene \u2019 s opponent . But Georgia Sens . Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue , along with Gov . Brian Kemp , have been noticeably silent on the matter , despite numerous requests for comment .\nAnd other key players in the new Republican establishment have rallied behind her . Although Rep. Jody Hice rescinded his support for her campaign the day after Politico released its story , Reps. Jim Jordan ( R-Ohio ) and House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs ( R-Arizona ) stand by their endorsements .\nThe National Association for Gun Rights PAC also endorsed Greene \u2019 s campaign , persuaded by her stalwart defense of the Second Amendment . \u201c It \u2019 s good to see a female say things like that , \u201d said the organization \u2019 s president Dudley Brown in an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c It \u2019 s got the \u2018 I \u2019 m the mama bear and I \u2019 m gon na protect not my family , but I \u2019 m gon na go to Congress and do my part to stop politicians from threatening your family . \u2019 \u201d\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 sought answers from Greene \u2019 s campaign about the race and initially we received no response . But after the distancing from national Republicans earlier in June , the campaign sent us a statement . Greene said she will not let her enemies \u201c whip [ her ] into submission , \u201d and that she \u2019 s \u201c sick-and-tired of watching establishment Republicans play defense while the Fake News Media cheers on Antifa terrorists , BLM rioters , and the woke cancel culture , as they burn our cities , loot our businesses , vandalize our memorials , and divide our nation . \u201d\nOn Wednesday , her campaign manager Isaiah Whartman informed \u2588\u2588\u2588 that Greene is suing her opponent in response to the \u201c defamatory television commercial \u201d his campaign aired that day .\nIn a letter obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 , Greene \u2019 s lawyer , L. Lin Wood , alleges that Dr. Cowan \u2019 s commercial \u201c [ accuses ] Ms. Greene and Taylor Commercial , Inc. of refusing to use a federally required program known as EVerify , \u201d and \u201c falsely [ asserts ] that Taylor Commercial , Inc. was not found under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security \u2019 s EVerify website. \u201d The letter says Dr. Cowan is liable for economic damages for defamation .\nNo doubt this lawsuit will spice up the race before the candidates face off again in the district \u2019 s August primary .\nOregon Senate primary winner Jo Rae Perkins is also an avowed QAnon believer . She was eager to talk to \u2588\u2588\u2588 about her affinity for Trumpism and hatred of the mainstream media . She has been open about public embrace of the QAnon conspiracy movement , having recently disavowed her own campaign \u2019 s attempt to dissociate her from the conspiracy .\nPerkins\u2014who says she gets her news from the Epoch Times , Fox News , and various podcasts\u2014explained that QAnon uses the Socratic method to crowdsource information . \u201c We \u2019 re encouraged to do our own critical thinking and our own research , \u201d she said in solidarity with the movement , saying it \u2019 s \u201c kind of like putting together a massive puzzle . \u201d\n\u201c If we dare look at something that they didn \u2019 t put out it \u2019 s a conspiracy , that it has to be wrong because they didn \u2019 t sanction it. \u201d She assured me that she is just a \u201c mainstream American \u201d trying to set the facts straight .\nBut then she \u2019 ll say something with a hint of conspiracy\u2014wondering , for example , how Black Lives Matter protesters so quickly produced masks that said \u201c Defund the Police \u201d days after Floyd was murdered . \u201c It could be totally organic , \u201d adding a caveat , \u201c then again it might not be . \u201d\nPerkins alleged that money being donated to Black Lives Matter\u2014a movement which she believes has \u201c gotten out of hand \u201d \u2014is really being funneled into Act Blue and the Democratic Party , a claim \u2588\u2588\u2588 Fact Check recently debunked .\n\u201c And this is where I \u2019 m going to get myself in trouble and I recognize that , \u201d she said , before proceeding . Perkins then alleged that the Black Lives Matter has been \u201c co-opted \u201d to victimize African Americans . Perkins added she had faith in far-right pundit Candace Owens , whom she believes is well-suited to put a stop to it . \u201c We seem to see this thing happening on four-year cycles that kind of coincide with the presidential election , \u201d she said .\nOn the topic of George Floyd , she said \u201c it certainly looks very damning for that police officer , but in our country you \u2019 re innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt , \u201d saying she will let the court and the jury come to their decision on how to handle Officer Derek Chauvin , captured on videotape kneeling on Floyd \u2019 s neck .\nPrior to her primary win , Perkins was endorsed by Rep. Mike Nearman , the Right to Life PAC , and the Republican Party of Linn County , her hometown . Oregon GOP Chairman Bill Currier did not respond to multiple requests for comment from \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nAlthough QAnon has captured its fair share of news headlines in recent years , Joseph Oscinski told me that the group \u2019 s popularity is likely \u201c at or near the ceiling , \u201d citing a 2018 poll he published in the Washington Post showing that QAnon at the time was \u201c neither well-known nor well-liked by Floridians in either party. \u201d He reminded me that a lot of the 2018 headlines about QAnon were , in reality , \u201c all based on 12 people were in Q shirts to a Trump rally in Tampa , \u201d and that Twitter activity and media coverage are unreliable measures of public opinion .\nMeanwhile one of the more prominent QAnon believers , David Hayes , ( he has 300,000 Twitter followers and published a book on the movement ) dismissed the Pew Research poll as \u201c fake news \u201d and , in an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 , claimed that there are \u201c hundreds of millions \u201d of Q followers .\nBut the QAnon conspiracy theory alone doesn \u2019 t explain why fringe candidates keep winning GOP primaries . Take Laura Loomer , for instance . A former investigative reporter for James O \u2019 Keefe \u2019 s Project Veritas , self-proclaimed Islamophobe , and far-right provocateur , Loomer is running in Florida \u2019 s 21st Congressional District . She rejected the QAnon conspiracy theory in an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 , but she worked alongside a man who amplified the Pizzagate conspiracy that led it it .\nLaura Loomer and Jack Posobiec , a reporter at One American News , made headlines in 2017 for disrupting an anti-Trump play in Central Park . But their professional relationship crumbled after they began squabbling over who deserved credit for propagating conspiracy theories relating to the Las Vegas shooting of 2017 , when Steven Paddock murdered 58 people at a concert .\nAccording to The Daily Beast , \u201c Loomer reported for a website owned by British provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos that members of Congress had been briefed on \u2018 ISIS ties \u2019 to the shooting \u201d in March 2017 . Posobiec announced three months later that he would run a segment called \u201c Inside Las Vegas \u201d on OANN to peddle other conspiracies about the shooting .\nOn Twitter , Loomer condemned Posobiec \u2019 s failure to cite her original\u2014albeit unsubstantiated\u2014reporting on the topic , which was all based on an unofficial report she found online that was authored by by two former intelligence officials . \u201c I just thought it was really shady how Jack calls himself my friend , but then he won \u2019 t give me credit for my work , \u201d she said .\nLoomer has called herself a \u201c proud Islamophobe \u201d and has previously referred to Muslims as \u201c savages \u201d and \u201c cancer. \u201d Most Florida Republicans have avoided commenting on her campaign , but Florida GOP Chairman and state Sen. Joe Gruters embraced her candidacy during an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nIn 2017 , she was banned from Uber and Lyft after sending a series of Islamophobic tweets after a terrorist drove a truck down a bike path and killed eight people in New York City : \u201c Someone needs to create a non Islamic form of Uber or Lyft because I never want to support another Islamic immigrant driver. \u201d She was also banned from Twitter the following year for calling Rep. Ilhan Omar ( D-Minn. ) a \u201c Jew hater , \u201d and then from Facebook and Instagram in 2019 for violating user agreements .\nLoomer has worked with discredited fabulist Jacob Wohl , locked herself to the doors of Twitter headquarters , and shouted to disrupt a congressional hearing . Loomer has also worked with conspiracy outlet InfoWars after the school shooting in Parkland , Florida .\nIn an interview , Loomer called herself \u201c a one woman squad , \u201d referring to the collective nickname for progressive firebrands , Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , D-N.Y. ; Ilhan Omar , D-MN ; Ayanna Pressley , D-MA . ; and Rashida Tlaib , D-MI .\n\u201c Unlike a lot of other candidates who are running for office who have made promises to take on the squad , I \u2019 ve already taken on the squad during my time as an investigative journalist. \u201d She spoke to me about her eagerness to make political affiliation a protected class under the Civil Rights Act in her crusade to combat the \u201c radical left , \u201d which she believes is \u201c trying to create a Communist stronghold in our country . \u201d\nIn years past , Loomer \u2019 s comments toward minorities would push her to the fringes of a typical primary race . But in this age of politics as entertainment , where Donald Trump has pushed past previous boundaries of acceptable rhetoric , she has been endorsed by Jeanine Pirro and Roger Stone ahead over her August 18 primary . Trump himself retweeted two tweets about her campaign .\nAs for her support within the state party , Sens . Marco Rubio and Rick Scott did not respond to numerous requests for comment . Florida GOP Chairman and state Sen. Joe Gruters , however , is vocal about his support for her campaign . \u201c I \u2019 ve developed a close relationship with Loomer , \u201d Gruters said in an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 , calling her \u201c a special candidate. \u201d Gruters invited her to a news conference in January to discuss his bill , the \u201c Stop Social Media Censorship Act , \u201d after which he said , \u201c I am proud to have Laura Loomer stand with me here today because what we are here discussing is social media censorship , and we are trying to stop the bias . \u201d\nWhen pressed on Loomer \u2019 s bigoted comments toward Muslims , Gruters said , \u201c You know what , here \u2019 s the deal . When you make comments that are powerful in any way , what will happen is you will be judged accordingly. \u201d The Florida GOP does not endorse candidates , but the chairman \u2019 s embrace of her campaign may sway voters come election season .\nDespite Loomer \u2019 s unabashed Islamophobia , she still plays the victim card . Loomer criticized Twitter and Facebook \u2019 s bans against her , telling me her campaign \u201c is the only de-platformed campaign in the nation \u201d that has \u201c been denied intentionally by these big tech social media companies access to campaign social media accounts. \u201d Loomer decried this as election interference and said her campaign \u201c has filed an FCC complaint against Twitter for giving illegal in kind contributions to my Democratic opponent Lois Frankel . \u201d\nLoomer moved to the social media app Parler as an alternative to Twitter , where she boasts 600,000 followers and regularly advocates for \u201c Twexit \u201d \u2014the collective abandonment of Twitter .\n\u201c People can say what they \u2019 re going to say , \u201d Loomer said regarding her disparaging comments toward Muslims over the years . \u201c But when you look at the tweet that I was banned for [ the Omar tweet ] , it had nothing to do with any of those comments . \u201d\n\u201c We can sit here and have conversations for days on end about ideologies \u201d and \u201c things I may have or may not have said in the past , \u201d Loomer said regarding her previous anti-Muslim comments . \u201c But at the end of the day , \u201d she said , \u201c it is not hate speech to call a public elected official anti-Jewish , right ? \u201d In her eyes , hate speech is nothing more than a conspiracy theory created by Democrats and the media .\nThe rise of these conspiracy Republicans is causing concern in some quarters of the party , with some leaders denouncing the crazy outright and others awkwardly seeking to avoid comment . But movements often take the shape of their leaders and with Donald Trump , an eager amplifier of many false or unproven conspiracies , as the country \u2019 s most prominent Republican and the party \u2019 s de facto leader , there will be no distancing the GOP from conspiracy theories\u2014at least for four more months .",

She even snagged a congratulatory endorsement from former deputy prime minister of Italy, Matteo Salvani, a neo-nationalist populist, following her win.\n\n\u201cThis is a Republican seat and will remain a Republican seat as Nancy Pelosi and senior House Democrats continue peddling their radical conspiracy theories and pushing their radical cancel culture,\u201d said National Republican Congressional Committee chairman Tom Emmer in a statement.\n\nWith a Twitter bio that proclaims \u201cRunning in Colorado\u2019s 3rd to get rid of RINOs,\u201d Boebert will face off Democratic primary winner Diane Mitsch Bush\u2014who lost to Tipton in 2018\u2014in the general election. In a reliably Republican district that Trump won by a 12 point margin in 2016, Mitsch Bush\u2019s progressive agenda will likely leave Boebert smooth sailing to November\u2019s general election.\n\n\u201cColorado deserves a fighter who will stand up for freedom, who believes in America and who is willing to take on all the left-wing lunatics who are trying so hard to ruin our country,\u201d Boebert said in a press release after her primary win. Boebert gained national recognition at a Beto O\u2019Rourke rally in September 2019 when she told the former presidential candidate, \u201cHell no, you won\u2019t take our guns,\u201d while sporting a glock on her hip. The comment landed her a Fox News appearance the following December.\n\nA die-hard Second Amendment defender who hails from Rifle, Colorado, Boebert owns Shooter\u2019s Grill, where she encourages her staff to open-carry while serving customers. She also recently defied Colorado\u2019s stay-at-home order by reopening her restaurant in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, which was met by a temporary suspension of her restaurant license by the county.\n\nWhen pressed on her knowledge of QAnon on the \u201cSteel Truth\u201d show in May, she said, \u201cI am familiar with that. And, so, that\u2019s more my mom\u2019s thing. She\u2019s a little fringe. I try to uh, I just try to keep things on track and positive. I am very familiar with it though.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything I heard of Q \u2014 I hope that this is real because it only means America is getting stronger and better, and people are returning to conservative values, and that's what I am for,\u201d she added. The conspiracy \u201cis only motivating and encouraging and bringing people together, stronger, and if this is real, then it could be really great for our country.\u201d\n\nIf Boebert offered only a halting embrace of the QAnon conspiracies, Marjorie Greene has shown no such hesitancy. And she\u2019s currently a favorite to end up in Congress.\n\nLike Boebert, Greene has captured attention for her brash, own-the-libs campaign strategy, and is expected to win Georgia\u2019s fourteenth district seat in the general election. After winning a June 9 primary with nearly twice the number of votes as the runner-up, Greene will be facing Dr. John Cowan in the next primary on August 11.\n\nGreene uploaded a video in 2017 in which she declared, \u201cQ is a patriot, we know that for sure, but we do not know who Q is.\u201d She proceeded to say, \u201cbut I\u2019m going to tell you about it, because I think it\u2019s something worth listening to and paying attention to,\u201d adding that \u201cmany of the things that he has given clues about and talked about on 4chan and other forums have really proven to be true.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the nearly 30-minute video\u2014which is still up as of today\u2014consists of Greene unspooling outlandish conspiracy theories, one of her favorites being Hillary Clinton\u2019s alleged sacrifice of a chicken in her backyard to the ancient Canaanite deity Moloch. After explaining Q\u2019s prophetic Great Awakening in which deep state Democrats will be held accountable for their sins, Greene says \u201cI really truly pray that this is true.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know cults are real and we know real evil exists, but it hides in the darkness,\u201d she warns, \u201cbecause it doesn\u2019t wanna get caught, because when Satanic worshippers and real evil comes out and it\u2019s pulled out into the light it can\u2019t survive, it just can\u2019t survive.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, there\u2019s a once in a lifetime opportunity to take this global cabal of Satan worshipping pedophiles out, and I think we have the president to do it, so I\u2019m very excited about that\u201d she says with a smile.\n\nMore recently, Politico uncovered recordings in which Greene said African Americans \u201care held slaves to the Democratic Party\u201d and that she would feel proud to see Confederate monuments if she were black because they demonstrate the progress American has made since the Civil War. \u201cI know a ton of white people that are as lazy and sorry and probably worse than black people,\u201d Greene said on the topic of black unemployment. \u201cAnd that has everything to do with their bad choices and their personal responsibility. That is not a skin-color issue.\u201d\n\nShe called the 2018 House midterms \u201can Islamic invasion of our government\u201d\u2014clearly alluding to the victories by Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib\u2014and said that \u201canyone that is a Muslim that believes in Sharia law does not belong in our government.\u201d\n\nDrew Florio, a spokesman for House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, said \u201cThese comments are appalling and Leader McCarthy has no tolerance for them.\u201d Reps. Liz Cheney (R-Wyoming) and Steve Scalise (R-Louisiana) are among other key Republicans who have denounced her campaign. The National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Chris Pack said NRCC Chairman Tom Emmer is \u201cpersonally disgusted by this rhetoric and condemns it in the strongest possible terms.\u201d\n\nGeorgia Reps. Austin Scott, Buddy Carter, and Drew Ferguson have publicly endorsed Greene\u2019s opponent. But Georgia Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, along with Gov. Brian Kemp, have been noticeably silent on the matter, despite numerous requests for comment.\n\nAnd other key players in the new Republican establishment have rallied behind her. Although Rep. Jody Hice rescinded his support for her campaign the day after Politico released its story, Reps. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs (R-Arizona) stand by their endorsements.\n\nThe National Association for Gun Rights PAC also endorsed Greene\u2019s campaign, persuaded by her stalwart defense of the Second Amendment. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see a female say things like that,\u201d said the organization\u2019s president Dudley Brown in an interview with The Dispatch. \u201cIt\u2019s got the \u2018I\u2019m the mama bear and I\u2019m gonna protect not my family, but I\u2019m gonna go to Congress and do my part to stop politicians from threatening your family.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Dispatch sought answers from Greene\u2019s campaign about the race and initially we received no response. But after the distancing from national Republicans earlier in June, the campaign sent us a statement. Greene said she will not let her enemies \u201cwhip [her] into submission,\u201d and that she\u2019s \u201csick-and-tired of watching establishment Republicans play defense while the Fake News Media cheers on Antifa terrorists, BLM rioters, and the woke cancel culture, as they burn our cities, loot our businesses, vandalize our memorials, and divide our nation.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, her campaign manager Isaiah Whartman informed The Dispatch that Greene is suing her opponent in response to the \u201cdefamatory television commercial\u201d his campaign aired that day.\n\nIn a letter obtained by The Dispatch, Greene\u2019s lawyer, L. Lin Wood, alleges that Dr. Cowan\u2019s commercial \u201c[accuses] Ms. Greene and Taylor Commercial, Inc. of refusing to use a federally required program known as EVerify,\u201d and \u201cfalsely [asserts] that Taylor Commercial, Inc. was not found under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\u2019s EVerify website.\u201d The letter says Dr. Cowan is liable for economic damages for defamation.\n\nNo doubt this lawsuit will spice up the race before the candidates face off again in the district\u2019s August primary.\n\nOregon Senate primary winner Jo Rae Perkins is also an avowed QAnon believer. She was eager to talk to The Dispatch about her affinity for Trumpism and hatred of the mainstream media. She has been open about public embrace of the QAnon conspiracy movement, having recently disavowed her own campaign\u2019s attempt to dissociate her from the conspiracy.\n\nPerkins\u2014who says she gets her news from the Epoch Times, Fox News, and various podcasts\u2014explained that QAnon uses the Socratic method to crowdsource information. \u201cWe\u2019re encouraged to do our own critical thinking and our own research,\u201d she said in solidarity with the movement, saying it\u2019s \u201ckind of like putting together a massive puzzle.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we dare look at something that they didn\u2019t put out it\u2019s a conspiracy, that it has to be wrong because they didn\u2019t sanction it.\u201d She assured me that she is just a \u201cmainstream American\u201d trying to set the facts straight.\n\nBut then she\u2019ll say something with a hint of conspiracy\u2014wondering, for example, how Black Lives Matter protesters so quickly produced masks that said \u201cDefund the Police\u201d days after Floyd was murdered. \u201cIt could be totally organic,\u201d adding a caveat, \u201cthen again it might not be.\u201d\n\nPerkins alleged that money being donated to Black Lives Matter\u2014a movement which she believes has \u201cgotten out of hand\u201d\u2014is really being funneled into Act Blue and the Democratic Party, a claim the Dispatch Fact Check recently debunked.\n\n\u201cAnd this is where I\u2019m going to get myself in trouble and I recognize that,\u201d she said, before proceeding. Perkins then alleged that the Black Lives Matter has been \u201cco-opted\u201d to victimize African Americans. Perkins added she had faith in far-right pundit Candace Owens, whom she believes is well-suited to put a stop to it. \u201cWe seem to see this thing happening on four-year cycles that kind of coincide with the presidential election,\u201d she said.\n\nOn the topic of George Floyd, she said \u201cit certainly looks very damning for that police officer, but in our country you\u2019re innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d saying she will let the court and the jury come to their decision on how to handle Officer Derek Chauvin, captured on videotape kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck.\n\nPrior to her primary win, Perkins was endorsed by Rep. Mike Nearman, the Right to Life PAC, and the Republican Party of Linn County, her hometown. Oregon GOP Chairman Bill Currier did not respond to multiple requests for comment from The Dispatch.\n\nAlthough QAnon has captured its fair share of news headlines in recent years, Joseph Oscinski told me that the group\u2019s popularity is likely \u201cat or near the ceiling,\u201d citing a 2018 poll he published in the Washington Post showing that QAnon at the time was \u201cneither well-known nor well-liked by Floridians in either party.\u201d He reminded me that a lot of the 2018 headlines about QAnon were, in reality, \u201call based on 12 people were in Q shirts to a Trump rally in Tampa,\u201d and that Twitter activity and media coverage are unreliable measures of public opinion.\n\nMeanwhile one of the more prominent QAnon believers, David Hayes, (he has 300,000 Twitter followers and published a book on the movement) dismissed the Pew Research poll as \u201cfake news\u201d and, in an interview with The Dispatch, claimed that there are \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of Q followers.\n\nLaura Loomer\n\nBut the QAnon conspiracy theory alone doesn\u2019t explain why fringe candidates keep winning GOP primaries. Take Laura Loomer, for instance. A former investigative reporter for James O\u2019Keefe\u2019s Project Veritas, self-proclaimed Islamophobe, and far-right provocateur, Loomer is running in Florida\u2019s 21st Congressional District. She rejected the QAnon conspiracy theory in an interview with The Dispatch, but she worked alongside a man who amplified the Pizzagate conspiracy that led it it.\n\nLaura Loomer and Jack Posobiec, a reporter at One American News, made headlines in 2017 for disrupting an anti-Trump play in Central Park. But their professional relationship crumbled after they began squabbling over who deserved credit for propagating conspiracy theories relating to the Las Vegas shooting of 2017, when Steven Paddock murdered 58 people at a concert.\n\nAccording to The Daily Beast, \u201cLoomer reported for a website owned by British provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos that members of Congress had been briefed on \u2018ISIS ties\u2019 to the shooting\u201d in March 2017. Posobiec announced three months later that he would run a segment called \u201cInside Las Vegas\u201d on OANN to peddle other conspiracies about the shooting.\n\nOn Twitter, Loomer condemned Posobiec\u2019s failure to cite her original\u2014albeit unsubstantiated\u2014reporting on the topic, which was all based on an unofficial report she found online that was authored by by two former intelligence officials. \u201cI just thought it was really shady how Jack calls himself my friend, but then he won\u2019t give me credit for my work,\u201d she said.\n\nLoomer has called herself a \u201cproud Islamophobe\u201d and has previously referred to Muslims as \u201csavages\u201d and \u201ccancer.\u201d Most Florida Republicans have avoided commenting on her campaign, but Florida GOP Chairman and state Sen. Joe Gruters embraced her candidacy during an interview with The Dispatch.\n\nIn 2017, she was banned from Uber and Lyft after sending a series of Islamophobic tweets after a terrorist drove a truck down a bike path and killed eight people in New York City: \u201cSomeone needs to create a non Islamic form of Uber or Lyft because I never want to support another Islamic immigrant driver.\u201d She was also banned from Twitter the following year for calling Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) a \u201cJew hater,\u201d and then from Facebook and Instagram in 2019 for violating user agreements.\n\nLoomer has worked with discredited fabulist Jacob Wohl, locked herself to the doors of Twitter headquarters, and shouted to disrupt a congressional hearing. Loomer has also worked with conspiracy outlet InfoWars after the school shooting in Parkland, Florida.\n\nIn an interview, Loomer called herself \u201ca one woman squad,\u201d referring to the collective nickname for progressive firebrands, Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.; Ilhan Omar, D-MN; Ayanna Pressley, D-MA.; and Rashida Tlaib, D-MI.\n\n\u201cUnlike a lot of other candidates who are running for office who have made promises to take on the squad, I\u2019ve already taken on the squad during my time as an investigative journalist.\u201d She spoke to me about her eagerness to make political affiliation a protected class under the Civil Rights Act in her crusade to combat the \u201cradical left,\u201d which she believes is \u201ctrying to create a Communist stronghold in our country.\u201d\n\nIn years past, Loomer\u2019s comments toward minorities would push her to the fringes of a typical primary race. But in this age of politics as entertainment, where Donald Trump has pushed past previous boundaries of acceptable rhetoric, she has been endorsed by Jeanine Pirro and Roger Stone ahead over her August 18 primary. Trump himself retweeted two tweets about her campaign.\n\nAs for her support within the state party, Sens. Marco Rubio and Rick Scott did not respond to numerous requests for comment. Florida GOP Chairman and state Sen. Joe Gruters, however, is vocal about his support for her campaign. \u201cI\u2019ve developed a close relationship with Loomer,\u201d Gruters said in an interview with The Dispatch, calling her \u201ca special candidate.\u201d Gruters invited her to a news conference in January to discuss his bill, the \u201cStop Social Media Censorship Act,\u201d after which he said, \u201cI am proud to have Laura Loomer stand with me here today because what we are here discussing is social media censorship, and we are trying to stop the bias.\u201d\n\nWhen pressed on Loomer\u2019s bigoted comments toward Muslims, Gruters said, \u201cYou know what, here\u2019s the deal. When you make comments that are powerful in any way, what will happen is you will be judged accordingly.\u201d The Florida GOP does not endorse candidates, but the chairman\u2019s embrace of her campaign may sway voters come election season.\n\nDespite Loomer\u2019s unabashed Islamophobia, she still plays the victim card. Loomer criticized Twitter and Facebook\u2019s bans against her, telling me her campaign \u201cis the only de-platformed campaign in the nation\u201d that has \u201cbeen denied intentionally by these big tech social media companies access to campaign social media accounts.\u201d Loomer decried this as election interference and said her campaign \u201chas filed an FCC complaint against Twitter for giving illegal in kind contributions to my Democratic opponent Lois Frankel.\u201d\n\nLoomer moved to the social media app Parler as an alternative to Twitter, where she boasts 600,000 followers and regularly advocates for \u201cTwexit\u201d\u2014the collective abandonment of Twitter.\n\n\u201cPeople can say what they\u2019re going to say,\u201d Loomer said regarding her disparaging comments toward Muslims over the years. \u201cBut when you look at the tweet that I was banned for [the Omar tweet], it had nothing to do with any of those comments.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can sit here and have conversations for days on end about ideologies\u201d and \u201cthings I may have or may not have said in the past,\u201d Loomer said regarding her previous anti-Muslim comments. \u201cBut at the end of the day,\u201d she said, \u201cit is not hate speech to call a public elected official anti-Jewish, right?\u201d In her eyes, hate speech is nothing more than a conspiracy theory created by Democrats and the media.\n\nThe rise of these conspiracy Republicans is causing concern in some quarters of the party, with some leaders denouncing the crazy outright and others awkwardly seeking to avoid comment. But movements often take the shape of their leaders and with Donald Trump, an eager amplifier of many false or unproven conspiracies, as the country\u2019s most prominent Republican and the party\u2019s de facto leader, there will be no distancing the GOP from conspiracy theories\u2014at least for four more months.\n\nAudrey Fahlberg is a reporter for The Dispatch.\n\nPhotograph of Marjorie Greene from Facebook.
