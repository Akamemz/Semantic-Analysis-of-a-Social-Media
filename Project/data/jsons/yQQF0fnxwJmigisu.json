    "content": "Immigration reform might be the big issue now on Capitol Hill , but gun control advocates are banking on continued public enthusiasm to revive the debate over expanded background checks , with a possible second Senate vote in the offing .\nThe initial measure , which would have mandated background checks for virtually all gun buyers , including those purchasing firearms at gun shows and on the Internet , got a 54-46 vote in the Senate , six votes short of the threshold to block a Republican filibuster . But recently some Senators who opposed the bipartisan bill , which polls show as overwhelmingly supported by Americans , have seen their favorability numbers plummet and felt the wrath of angry constituents at town hall meetings . This has buoyed the bill 's backers and led to a growing consensus that the bill will be given a second chance in the Senate -- and this time get the half-dozen votes needed to send it to the House of Representatives , which would n't dare dismiss the people 's obvious preference in this matter .\nA tidy tale for gun control supporters , but all wrong , some political experts say . The chances that the measure sponsored by Sens . Joe Manchin , D-W.Va. , and Patrick Toomey , R-Pa. , will do significantly better next time is pure wishful thinking : For one thing , some watchers say , if the two sides had any common ground they would have found it already ; for another , the politics of gun control may have convincingly painful emotional testimony on the side of background check advocates , but congressmen are ultimately swayed by more pragmatic concerns .\nHere are six reasons why Senators who opposed the background checks bill the first time are unlikely to switch their votes :\nPro-gun control groups have attacked Sens . Kelly Ayotte , R-N.H. , and Max Baucus , D-Mont. , in television and newspaper ads , criticizing them for voting against the wishes of a majority of their constituents and giving criminals a pass in opposing Manchin/Toomey .\n\u201c That 's not New Hampshire common sense , \u201d an ad run by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg \u2019 s Mayors Against Illegal Guns said of Ayotte . \u201c That 's gone Washington . \u201d\nIn turn , this week Ayotte clarified her support for \u201c effective background checks \u201d but added that she doesn \u2019 t want to expand what she said is a \u201c flawed system. \u201d She wants it fixed , current laws enforced , and a focus on mental health .\n\u201c There are no easy answers , \u201d she wrote in an op-ed that ran in the BedfordPatch . \u201c Even if the proposed expansion of background checks had been in place , it wouldn \u2019 t have prevented the Sandy Hook tragedy -- where the perpetrator obtained the firearms he used by killing his own mother , who owned them lawfully . \u201d\nLike many of her colleagues , Ayotte has already done the math and studied the history . She knows that the National Rifle Association has plenty of financial power behind its threats to help defeat \u201c anti-gun legislators \u201d and can likely mobilize far more resources than background check supporters can . Moreover , no legislator has yet lost a seat for supporting gun rights .\n\u201c [ The NRA 's ] Wayne LaPierre is the most powerful person on Capitol Hill , \u201d said Tom Whalen , a political historian at Boston University . \u201c [ The Republican caucus ] will not lift a finger to promote any kind of background checks . I just think it \u2019 s a pipe dream . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s been five months since 20 children and six educators were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown , Conn . The chances of passing background checks would have been better if lawmakers had acted in the immediate aftermath of the incident .\n\u201c The further away you get from [ Sandy Hook ] , the less impact you have on people , \u201d said Harry Wilson , director of the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research at Roanoke College in Virginia . \u201c I think [ that window of opportunity ] probably has closed . \u201d\nA huge majority of Americans do favor passing gun background checks . In March , an ABC News/Washington Post poll found that 91 percent of Americans support mandatory checks when purchases are made at gun shows or online . But virtually everyone thinks that this vast majority is not as motivated to use gun control as a litmus test for how it will vote in an election , while NRA members are far more single-issue-oriented .\nNew York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords , D-Ariz. , who survived a 2011 gun massacre in Tucson , are among the handful of gun control advocates with the monetary power and influence to match the NRA 's , but so far their threats are only that . Indeed , the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence , a well-connected nonprofit named after James Brady , the press secretary for President Ronald Reagan who was shot and permanently paralyzed when a would-be assassin tried to kill Reagan in 1981 , has been trying for years to take on the gun lobby but hasn \u2019 t quite been able to pack as much punch . The Brady Campaign has been pushing for extensive background checks , and it has tried to limit the number of firearms an individual can buy at one time . It has also lobbied for a ban on assault weapons and ammunition clips holding more than 10 bullets -- an idea that also failed in the Senate last month , 40-60 .\n\u201c As long as [ lawmakers ] believe that the NRA and other gun-rights groups can mobilize their forces and their funds and potentially find strong challenger candidates to them , they are going to resist changing their positions , \u201d said Don Haider-Markel , a political science professor at the University of Kansas .\nNot only is it difficult to get senators to switch votes , but so many issues are brewing in Congress at the moment that their attention may already be elsewhere -- and the GOP appears happy to have buried gun control and not adding to President Barack Obama 's list of achievements .\nOf all the president 's wish-list items , immigration reform is the one most likely to pass . Republicans already gave Obama a tax increase on the wealthy last year , and they still want spending cuts beyond sequestration before they 'll do a budget deal .\n\u201c The more energy they spend on gun control is the less they spend on immigration , \u201d Wilson said . \u201c That is not a good idea . \u201d\nEven if a background checks bill squeaks through the Senate , it stands little chance in the House , which is controlled by the GOP and dominated by conservative wings of both the Republican and Democratic parties . To them , spending cuts and other fiscal issues are the main priorities ; for example , the House leadership 's attention recently has been taken by the question of who among the U.S. government 's creditors should be paid first if there is a breach of the debt limit .\n\u201c At this point , even a victory in the Senate is largely symbolic , \u201d said Haider-Markel . \u201c In the House , you have even more difficulty with more Democrats in conservative districts that will be looking at 2014 and will be worried about the repercussions of a vote for background checks . \u201d\nManchin/Toomey is a simple bill , expanding background checks while making it a felony to create a gun registry , which the NRA steadfastly opposes .
