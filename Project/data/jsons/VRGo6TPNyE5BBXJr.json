    "content": "With support for gay marriage at a record high among Americans , Republican party leaders from around the country doubled down to oppose it at the Republican National Committee 's spring meeting in Los Angeles Friday .\nMembers of the committee voted unanimously to reaffirm the language in the GOP platform defining marriage `` as the union of one man and one woman . '' The resolution went further , asking the U.S. Supreme Court to `` uphold the sanctity of marriage in its rulings on Proposition 8 and the Federal Defense of Marriage Act . ''\nAn \u2588\u2588\u2588-Washington Post poll conducted in March found that 58 percent of Americans said it should be legal for gay and lesbian couples to marry . And support for gay marriage has been increasing among Republicans : In the latest poll , 34 percent of them said they supported it -- an 18 point uptick from 2004 .\nEarlier today , RNC Chairman Reince Priebus joked in his remarks to the group that Lady Gaga wo n't be `` chairing our platform committee . '' Gaga is a noted gay rights activist .\n`` It 's absolutely not true that I asked Lady Gaga to perform at the Reagan Library dinner tonight , '' according to a text of Priebus 's prepared comments , a reference to reports that a separate GOP group offered to pay the entertainer to perform at an event during last summer 's Republican National Convention . `` For the record , she also wo n't be chairing our platform committee or serving as our new director of surrogate operations . ''\nRepublican leaders have been meeting this week at a hotel less than a mile from West Hollywood , Calif. , a city with a large gay and lesbian population .\nThe vote may appease social conservatives who have been threatening to withhold their support from the GOP over rifts about where the party is headed on social issues .\nAfter the Republican National Committee hinted at new outreach to gay voters , and possibly changing its stance or at least its tone on gay-rights issues , 11 influential social-conservative groups aired their grievances in a letter addressed to Priebus timed to coincide with the start of the RNC 's meeting .\nLed by Family Research Council President Tony Perkins , who told donors not to give national Republican leaders `` a dime of your hard-earned money '' until the party clarified its positions on social issues .\n`` We respectfully warn GOP leadership that an abandonment of its principles will necessarily result in the abandonment of our constituents to their support , '' the groups warned Priebus . `` We could not change that even if we wished to .
