    "content": "The president of Minneapolis \u2019 s police union called George Floyd a \u201c violent criminal \u201d and those protesting his killing by a police officer a \u201c terrorist movement. \u201d A union chief in Baltimore once said Black Lives Matter activists were a \u201c lynch mob \u201d ; one in Philadelphia referred to them as \u201c a pack of rabid animals. \u201d Another has labeled St. Louis \u2019 s democratically elected prosecutor , who is black and supports police reform , a \u201c menace to society \u201d who must be removed \u201c by force \u201d if necessary .\nAll of these union leaders also have this in common : They are white .\nIn many cities , police officers are more likely to be white than the people they are sworn to protect and serve . But this is especially true of the presidents of their unions , \u2588\u2588\u2588 found in an analysis of demographic data from major U.S. police departments . Of the 15 largest departments in which a majority of officers are people of color , only one , Memphis , has a union leader who is black .\nAnother , in Honolulu , is led by an Asian-Pacific Islander , and the union president of the Miami Police Department is white Hispanic .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 confirmed the race of 12 union leaders by asking them or their staff directly , using voter registration records and asking local reporters who cover the police ; three leaders who appear to be white in photos on their unions \u2019 websites did not respond to repeated calls .\nAbout four-fifths of the Miami-Dade Police Department \u2019 s officers , who patrol the county surrounding Miami , are people of color , but the head of their union is white . In Atlanta , about two-thirds of officers are people of color , but the union chief is white . It \u2019 s a similar story in many other major cities such as Washington , D.C. , New Orleans , Houston and Los Angeles : Most police are not white , but the person who represents their interests\u2014who publicly speaks for them\u2014is .\nThe same is true of the entire leadership structure of many police unions and associations . The Chicago Fraternal Order of Police has no black officers among its top brass , the union confirmed . California \u2019 s statewide FOP appears to have an executive board consisting of nine white men\u2014and one black man serving as the chaplain . ( The board did not respond to multiple calls . )\n\u201c It is to the detriment of policing , period , that our community is not represented at police union tables , \u201d said Sonia Pruitt , chairwoman of the National Black Police Association , an advocacy group , not a union , for black cops . Police unions are so powerful that \u201c if they had leaders who said , \u2018 Listen , what happened to George Floyd was absolutely terrible , \u2019 officers around the country would follow . \u201d\nAccording to a Pew survey in 2017 of nearly 8,000 police officers nationally , 92 percent of white officers believe the United States has already achieved equal rights for black people , while only 29 percent of black officers do . And while only 27 percent of white officers believe that protests against police violence are motivated at least in part by a genuine desire for accountability , roughly 70 percent of black officers do .\nMichael Williams , president of the Memphis Police Association , says he \u2019 s \u201c one of the lone black guys doing this . \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 ve been discriminated against . I wasn \u2019 t socioeconomically privileged growing up , \u201d he said . \u201c I understand what these young people in the streets are going through more than some of my white contemporaries . \u201d\nWilliams also noted that unlike many white union leaders , he personally knows black pastors , activists and even gang members , which he says helps him defuse community tension in the aftermath of police violence . \u201c We don \u2019 t always agree , \u201d he said , \u201c but we have a mutual respect . \u201d\nLike other labor organizations , many police unions negotiate salaries and benefits for officers as well as fight for job protections . The role of all union chiefs is to go to battle for workers , so they are often pugnacious and defend members even if charged with wrongdoing , whether representing cops , teachers , truckers or others .\nBut this is particularly true of police union leaders , who have long protected members accused of brutality and racism by winning employment contracts that make it difficult or impossible to fire or discipline them . They have also neutered internal-affairs units and civilian review boards , both of which also try to hold bad cops accountable .\nMeanwhile , some police unions have paid for warrior training , instead of de-escalation training , for the officers they represent . And they have helped scrub racist cops ' social media pages as a further way of protecting them .\nThe Fraternal Order of Police , the national association of unions that represents roughly 330,000 officers nationwide , \u201c seems committed to putting white men in charge , \u201d wrote Paul Butler , a former federal prosecutor who is a law professor at Georgetown University and the author of \u201c Chokehold : Policing Black Men , \u201d in a 2017 essay for \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c The organization serves as a union cum fraternity for white cops and has a retrograde effect on policing , especially as it relates to civil rights . \u201d\nJim Pasco , executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police , responded to a question about why there is so little minority representation in police union leadership with an email saying , \u201c I don \u2019 t respond to questions which telegraph a negative story . \u201d\nVince Champion , the Southeast Regional Director of the International Brotherhood of Police Officers , said he has never heard black officers complain that they don \u2019 t trust him to represent their interests because he is a white man .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t see color , and we don \u2019 t see race , \u201d said Champion , who represents members in the Atlanta Police Department , where 63 percent of sworn officers were people of color according to the latest available federal data in 2013 . \u201c We see blue .
