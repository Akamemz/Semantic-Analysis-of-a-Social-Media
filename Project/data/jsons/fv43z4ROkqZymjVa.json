ET Thursday night , just days before Super Tuesday .\nMeanwhile , John Kasich is under pressure from some Republicans to get out of the race and make room for Rubio in the so-called and ever-shrinking establishment lane . And Ben Carson says he 's set on going the long haul -- but it 's not clear if anything will emerge as his saving grace .\nTime for Donald Trump to go in for the kill ?\nDonald Trump is on a roll , and it 's not clear what , if anything , can stop him .\nAfter wins in New Hampshire South Carolina and Nevada , he 's confident heading into March 1 , when a slew of states , including Texas , Alabama , Arkansas , Georgia and Tennessee , will hold GOP contests .\nJUST WATCHED Is GOP ready to embrace Trump ?

''\nIf the past six months offer any indication , Trump 's performance at Thursday 's CNN debate is unlikely to sway the Republican electorate either for or against him .

And how will he respond when attacked ?\nTrump has angrily gone after Cruz over the last few weeks , calling the Texas senator a `` liar '' and raising ethical questions about his rival 's campaign tactics .

If Rubio tries to pick a fight with Trump , that would likely change quickly .\nAnd for anyone wondering if this will be the debate where a more presidential Trump takes the stage , do n't hold your breath . Although he has repeatedly promised that he would use a different tone if elected to the White House , he has n't seemed interested in doing so as a candidate .\nJust this week , Trump stirred up fresh controversy by saying about a protester at a campaign rally : `` I 'd like to punch him in the face . ''\nHe finished behind Trump and Rubio in both South Carolina and Nevada , a letdown after his cycle-opening victory in the Iowa caucuses .\nAnd the conservative senator , whose campaign slogan is `` Trusted , '' has been dogged by relentless accusations from his rivals of running a dishonest campaign and of deploying dirty political tactics .\nJUST WATCHED Ted Cruz : I 'm the only one who can beat Donald Trump Replay More Videos ...

Since then , Cruz 's rivals have slammed the senator of lying to get ahead , with Trump being particularly aggressive in his stump speeches and on social media .
