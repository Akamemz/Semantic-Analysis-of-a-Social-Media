It was during the worst month of those four horrific years , in March 2002 , that pollsters found peak Israeli support for the territorial concessions proposed by President Bill Clinton in December 2000 , including a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem with sovereignty over the Al Aqsa compound . Last week , about two-thirds of Jewish Israelis surveyed in a poll said they wished to separate from the Palestinian neighborhoods of East Jerusalem , excluding the Old City .\nContrary to claims that Israel \u2019 s occupation is growing only further entrenched , the decades since Israel conquered East Jerusalem , the West Bank and Gaza have been characterized by a slow process of Israeli separation , often reluctant and driven by violence . To date , the unrest has not approached the scale that led successive prime ministers to partial withdrawals : Yitzhak Rabin \u2019 s bestowing limited autonomy on Palestinians in parts of Gaza and the West Bank at the end of the first intifada ; Benjamin Netanyahu \u2019 s pulling out of most of Hebron after the deadly 1996 riots over Israeli excavations beneath the Al Aqsa compound ; and Ariel Sharon \u2019 s announcing a withdrawal from Gaza during the second intifada .\nIt was at that time that Mr. Sharon erected the wall and fence separating Israel from the West Bank . Palestinians , like most of the international community , view the wall as an illegal seizure of 8.5 percent of the West Bank , but by the same token , it is now nearly impossible to imagine that any of the 91.5 percent of territory on the Palestinian side of the barrier would go to Israel in a future partition .\nIt is a deeply regrettable fact that , during the past quarter-century , violence has been the most consistent factor in Israeli territorial withdrawal . That may partly explain why growing numbers of Palestinians support an uprising and demand the resignation of President Mahmoud Abbas , who abhors attacks on Israelis and has presided over nearly a decade of almost total quiet in the West Bank without any gains to show for it .\nLast month , a survey of Palestinians found support for an armed intifada at 57 percent ( and at 71 percent among 18- to 22-year-old men ) .
