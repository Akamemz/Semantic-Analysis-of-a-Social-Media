The Minneapolis City Council voted in June to disband its police department entirely . As cities look for what \u2019 s next , there is already a proven system of de-escalation for the high volume of mental health calls that police respond to , which often end in violence .\nSuch programs take police out of the equation when someone is going through a mental health crisis , struggling with substance abuse , or experiencing homelessness . When police show up , situations can escalate , and the use of force can be disproportionate , especially towards Black people ; a 2016 study estimated that 20 percent to 50 percent of fatal encounters with law enforcement involved someone with a mental illness . Advocates say the CAHOOTS model shows those encounters aren \u2019 t inevitable : Less than one percent of the calls that CAHOOTS responds to need police assistance . The CAHOOTS system relies on trauma-informed de-escalation and harm reduction , which reduces calls to police , averts harmful arrest-release-repeat cycles , and prevents violent police encounters .\nThe White Bird Clinic in Eugene started CAHOOTS 31 years ago as an alternative for people who felt alienated or disenfranchised from systems that had failed them , CAHOOTS Operations Coordinator Tim Black said in an interview . \u201c We \u2019 re there to listen , we \u2019 re there to empathize , and we \u2019 re there to really reflect on what they \u2019 re going through , \u201d and to discuss ways to access resources to help them . CAHOOTS\u2014a free , 24/7 community service\u2014is funded by the city at a cost of around $ 2 million , or a little over 1 percent of the Eugene Police Department \u2019 s annual budget , though it is currently fundraising to expand and make up for COVID-19-related budget cuts .\nUnder the model , instead of police , a medic and a mental health worker are dispatched for calls such as welfare checks or potential overdoses . In 2017 , such teams answered 17 percent of the Eugene Police Department \u2019 s overall call volume . This has saved the city , on average , $ 8.5 million each year from 2014-2017 , according to the White Bird Clinic .\n\u201c The patient that we \u2019 re serving is the expert in their situation . They know that we \u2019 re a voluntary resource and that we \u2019 re not going to take their rights away just because we \u2019 ve shown up on scene . \u201d\nThough CAHOOTS uses the police department \u2019 s central dispatch , it is distinct from the department . Employees do not carry guns or wear uniforms ; instead , they wear casual hoodies and drive vans with a dove painted on the side . CAHOOTS \u2019 methods are designed to prevent escalation , Black said . \u201c If an officer enters that situation with power , with authority , with that uniform and a command presence , that situation is really likely to escalate . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s a false assumption that people experiencing a mental health crisis will respond violently , Black said , and a police response is often unnecessary . CAHOOTS fielded over 24,000 calls last year ; less than 1 percent of them needed assistance from police , and no one has ever been seriously injured . \u201c That type of mentality really contributes to the othering that has permitted oppression and marginalization to persist , \u201d Black said . \u201c By and large , folks who are unhoused , who are experiencing behavioral health issues , are much more likely to be the victims of violence than the perpetrators . \u201d\nCAHOOTS differs from other mental health partnerships with the police in important ways : Staff employ \u201c unconditional positive regard , \u201d a phrase from psychology that means complete support and acceptance for the people they encounter , and the organization is run as a \u201c consensus collective , \u201d rather than a hierarchy . Every employee \u2019 s voice carries equal weight .\nEach crisis worker completes 500 hours of training in areas including medical care , conflict resolution and crisis counseling . Around 60 percent of CAHOOTS \u2019 patients are homeless , and about 30 percent have severe or persistent mental illness . \u201c The patient that we \u2019 re serving is the expert in their situation , \u201d Black said . \u201c They know that we \u2019 re a voluntary resource and that we \u2019 re not going to take their rights away just because we \u2019 ve shown up on scene . \u201d\nDorothy Siemens , an artist who grew up in Eugene and still lives there , said that she , her family and her friends all call CAHOOTS , rather than the police , when they see someone in distress . The option makes her feel like a more responsible community member . When Siemens managed a downtown cafe , she used the service often . \u201c I really don \u2019 t have the tools , and I think the police in our community also don \u2019 t have the tools \u201d for people in crisis , she said . \u201c There really shouldn \u2019 t be one group of people who is expected to cover all of those bases , especially a group a people who are weaponized and militarized . \u2026 Their training shows them \u2018 that \u2019 s something I have to respond to with force. \u2019 \u201c\nIncreasingly , community organizers are reaching out to CAHOOTS , hoping to develop similar programs . Since 2013 , the city of Portland , Oregon , just a couple hours north of Eugene , has seen a 60 percent increase of \u201c unwanted person \u201d calls to 911 , according to a Willamette Week analysis of Portland Police Bureau data . In 2017 , an Oregonian analysis found that 52 percent of arrests involved homeless individuals , even though they comprise less than 3 percent of Portland \u2019 s population .\nIn 2019 , Portland City Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty and Street Roots , a homeless advocacy publication , introduced Portland Street Response , a police alternative based on the CAHOOTS model . The pilot program , which was officially approved and funded by the city last November , focused on a southeast Portland neighborhood where 911 calls were on the rise . The program is now on hold because of the coronavirus , but Hardesty hopes to get on the ground soon . As the city considers cutting its police budget , Hardesty is pushing for $ 4.8 million to go towards Portland Street Response instead . \u201c We are long overdue for investments in police alternatives , including Portland Street Response , \u201d Hardesty , the first Black woman elected to Portland \u2019 s city council , said in a statement to High Country News . \u201c There \u2019 s no doubt we need to reimagine what it looks like to get the right responder to the right situation at the right time . \u201d\nNationwide protests have spurred renewed urgency for programs like these , which show a stark contrast to the typical police response . This month , the Coalition for Police Accountability in Oakland presented a final report to the city council to begin its own pilot program , MACRO , this summer . In Denver , in May , Vinnie Cervantes worked as a medic with the Denver Alliance for Street Health Response , which he also directs . It \u2019 s part of a mutual aid nexus that emerged during protests in the city over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis . Cervantes and others treated protesters who were left bleeding and bruised after police fired off tear gas , rubber bullets and flash-bangs and pummeled them with batons . To Cervantes and others , it was yet another example of how quickly police resort to excessive force . \u201c Our community stepped up to collaborate and create a network of support to solve a larger public safety crisis , \u201d Cervantes said . \u201c That \u2019 s something we can take beyond protest . \u201d\n\u201c There \u2019 s no doubt we need to reimagine what it looks like to get the right responder to the right situation at the right time . \u201d\nPolicing and jails account for 30 percent of Denver \u2019 s overall budget . The repurposing of those funds would be a huge opportunity for collective efforts like Denver Alliance , which resembles the CAHOOTS model .

Each program needs to be adaptive and reflect its community ; Eugene , after all , is much smaller and has a whiter population than Denver , Oakland or Portland . \u201c It \u2019 s really important that it is community-based , by people that look like us and that have our shared experience , \u201d said Cervantes , who is Latino .
