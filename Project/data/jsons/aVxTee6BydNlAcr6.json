    "content": "President Trump has long promised to create jobs , and has consistently delivered -- especially in his own White House and Cabinet , where rapid turnover is showing no signs of slowing down as 2018 comes to a close .\nHigh-profile departures in the Trump administration -- from former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price and Press Secretary Sean Spicer to fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson ( whom Trump recently characterized as `` lazy as hell '' and `` dumb as a rock '' ) -- have attracted the most attention . They have contributed to what some analysts have called an unprecedented number of high-level Cabinet departures going back 100 years .\nThe most popular parlor game in Washington right now centers on who will replace outgoing Chief of Staff John Kelly .\nTRUMP REVEALS CHIEF OF STAFF SEARCH DOWN TO 5 CANDIDATES\n`` At some point , everybody leaves , '' Trump told `` 60 Minutes '' host Lesley Stahl in October . `` Everybody . People leave . That 's Washington . ''\nBut dozens of Executive Branch offices , both inside and outside 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue , have emptied and filled at historic rates , with and without fanfare . The exits have included unfriendly dismissals , voluntary moves to the private sector , and other resignations .\nThe headline-grabbing departures include two national security advisers -- H.R . McMaster and Michael Flynn , who was booted for misleading the White House about conversations with the Russian ambassador and is now facing sentencing for lying to the FBI . John Bolton now runs the national security ship .\nBefore Kelly , former GOP chairman Reince Priebus also came and went at the helm of the White House operation . He has since dished on the drama inside the Oval Office in the book `` The Gatekeepers . ''\n`` Take everything you 've heard and multiply it by 50 , '' Priebus said .\nWithin the Cabinet , Attorney General Jeff Sessions was the latest to be forced out , submitting his resignation the day after the midterms at the request of the president .

EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt resigned over the summer amid numerous ethics scandals , replaced by Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler . Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin was pushed out amid his own ethics controversy . U.N .

Sources told Politico that Flynn and Townley viewed the rejection as a `` hit job from inside the CIA on Flynn and the people close to him '' because of Townley 's critical views of the intelligence community .\nEzra Cohen-Watnick was reportedly forced out as a senior intelligence director at the NSC as well , for supposedly leaking information about so-called `` unmasking '' activities by Obama administration officials to California Republican Rep.
