    "content": "According to analysis by Nick Bunker , an economist with the jobs site Indeed , wage growth is currently strongest for workers in low-wage industries , such as clothing stores , supermarkets , amusement parks , and casinos . And earnings are growing most slowly in higher-wage industries , such as medical labs , law firms , and broadcasting and telecom companies .\nBunker \u2019 s analysis is not an outlier . A Goldman Sachs look at data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics found growth for the bottom half of earners at its highest rate of the cycle . And even among that bottom half , the biggest gains are going to workers earning the least . A New York Times analysis of data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta found that wage growth among the lowest 25 percent of earners had exceeded the growth in every other quartile .\nIn fact , according to Bunker \u2019 s research , wages for low-income workers may be growing at their highest rate in 20 years .\nWhat \u2019 s happening here ? Donald Trump hasn \u2019 t sprinkled MAGA pixie dust over the U.S. economy . In fact , his trade war has clearly diminished employment growth in industries , that are sensitive to foreign markets , such as manufacturing . Rather , a tight labor market and state-by-state minimum wage hikes have combined to push up wage growth for the poorest workers . The sluggishness of overall wage growth is concealing the fact that the labor market has done wonderful things for wages at the low end .\nDerek Thompson : Why no one wants to talk about the booming economy\nOne reason you haven \u2019 t heard this economic narrative may be that it \u2019 s inconvenient for members of both political parties to talk about , especially at a time when economic analysis has , like everything else , become a proxy for political orientation .

This isn \u2019 t just poor motivated reasoning ; it also attributes way too much power to the American president , who exerts very little control over the domestic economy .
