Multiple states have made tens of millions of dollars a year selling data .\nMotherboard has obtained hundreds of pages of documents from DMVs through public records requests that lay out the practice . Members of the public may not be aware that when they provide their name , address , and in some cases other personal information to the DMV for the purposes of getting a driver 's license or registering a vehicle , the DMV often then turns around and offers that information for sale .\nMany of the private investigators that DMVs have sold data to explicitly advertise that they will surveil spouses to see if they 're cheating .\n`` You need to learn what they \u2019 ve been doing , when they \u2019 ve been doing it , who they \u2019 ve been doing it with and how long it has been going on . You need to see proof with your own eyes , '' reads the website of Integrity Investigations , one private investigator firm that buys data from DMVs .\n`` Under this MOU [ memorandum of understanding ] , the Requesting Party will be provided , via remote electronic means , information pertaining to driver licenses and vehicles , including personal information authorized to be released , '' one agreement between a DMV and its clients reads .\nA small section of a document from the Virginia DMV showing which private investigators the DMV has data selling agreements with .

''\nThe sale of this data to licensed private investigators is perfectly legal , due to the Driver 's Privacy Protection Act ( DPPA ) , a law written in the '90s before privacy became the cultural focus that it is today , but which critics believe should be changed . The process of becoming a licensed private investigator varies from state to state , and can be strict , according to multiple sources close to the industry .
