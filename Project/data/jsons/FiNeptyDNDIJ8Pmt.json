''\nIn the 15-minute interview , which stemmed from \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s inquiries for a separate story , the president touched on North Korea , his former campaign aide David Bossie , the Senate Intelligence Committee \u2019 s subpoena to his son , his view of Steve Bannon and Rudy Giuliani \u2019 s upcoming trip to Ukraine .\nTrump again expressed frustration that the Senate Intelligence Committee subpoenaed his oldest son , Donald Trump Jr. , to testify as part of the panel \u2019 s ongoing investigation into 2016 Russian election interference . But he said he had not spoken to Sen. Richard Burr ( R-N.C. ) , the panel \u2019 s chairman , who has come under fire from some Republicans for signing off on the subpoena .\n\u201c I won the state of North Carolina and frankly had another Republican won [ the primary ] , they would not have won the state . I have a great relationship to that state . So I was very surprised , \u201d Trump said . \u201c [ Burr ] came in , ran along with me . I didn \u2019 t know him well but he ran along with me . So yeah , I was very surprised to see that . \u201d\nThe president also gently criticized his former deputy campaign manager and longtime friend David Bossie , who has been accused of using his political group to scam Republican voters out of millions of dollars for personal financial gain under the guise of supporting Trump \u2019 s re-election .\n\u201c I would be disappointed in David if he did that , \u201d he said , later adding : \u201c I would be disappointed if everything wasn \u2019 t on the up and up . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s 2020 campaign issued a sharply-worded statement on Tuesday saying that it \u201c condemns any organization that deceptively uses the President \u2019 s name , likeness , trademarks , or branding and confuses voters. \u201d The campaign encouraged authorities \u201c to investigate all alleged scam groups for potential illegal activities . \u201d\nTrump said he has not spoken to Bossie about the subject .\nIn a statement , Bossie said , \u201c For 15 years we have scrupulously complied with every campaign law and regulation that exists . The accusations are false and personally offensive to me. \u201d He added that he has \u201c worked tirelessly to support President Trump and his agenda and I am not going to let smears from old enemies on the left stop me . \u201d\nEven amid his apparent anger at one close ally , Trump hinted at a softened view towards a former one : Steve Bannon , whom Trump excommunicated last year after the strategist was quoted in Michael Wolff \u2019 s incendiary book about the White House , \u201c Fire and Fury . \u201d\n\u201c Well , I always liked Steve and I mean the last seven months or eight months , I mean , you can \u2019 t have nicer statements stated about yourself than the things he \u2019 s been saying about me , \u201d Trump said , adding later , \u201c You \u2019 ve seen what he \u2019 s said on the various shows and you \u2019 ve seen what he \u2019 s written and it \u2019 s very nice and I appreciate it .

As vice president , Joe Biden pressured Ukraine \u2019 s government to oust a top anti-corruption official who had reportedly investigated a Ukrainian energy company in which Hunter Biden had a financial interest , although no evidence has emerged that Joe Biden was acting to assist his son , and it is not clear that the official was probing the company at the time .\nTrump has also alleged that Ukraine \u2019 s government aided Hillary Clinton \u2019 s 2016 campaign by releasing damaging information about his since-jailed campaign manager , Paul Manafort , who made millions doing political work in the country .\nSome Democrats have expressed concern that Trump could direct the Justice Department to pursue the allegations , which they call a diversion from Russia \u2019 s systematic 2016 election meddling , and warn that it would be an abuse of power for political purposes .\nWhen asked whether he would consider directing Attorney General Bill Barr to investigate the Bidens , as some Democrats fear , Trump said he had not spoken to Barr about the issue . But he left open the possibility , saying \u201c certainly it would be an appropriate thing to \u201d discuss with Barr .\n\u201c Certainly it is a very big issue and we \u2019 ll see what happens . I have not spoken to him about it . Would I speak to him about it ? I haven \u2019 t thought of that . I mean , you \u2019 re asking me a question I just haven \u2019 t thought of , \u201d he said , noting it \u201c could be a very big situation \u201d for Biden .\n\u201c Because he \u2019 s a Democrat it \u2019 s about 1/100 the size of the fact that if he were a Republican , it would be a lot bigger , \u201d he alleged .\nTrump also said that he plans to speak to Rudy Giuliani about his personal attorney \u2019 s imminent plans to go to Ukraine to reportedly encourage the Ukrainian president to investigate the origins of the Russia investigation and Hunter Biden \u2019 s role on the board of directors of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch .\n\u201c I will speak to him about it before he leaves .
