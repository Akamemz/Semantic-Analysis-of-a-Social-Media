    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 In a major rebuke to President Donald Trump on his signature domestic policy issue , the Republican-controlled Senate voted Thursday to block the national emergency the president declared to free up money for his border wall .\nA dozen Republicans joined all Democrats backing a resolution to rescind Trump \u2019 s effort to tap into more than $ 6 billion that Congress set aside for other programs , most of them at the Pentagon .\nTrump vowed to use his veto power for the first time to kill the resolution , which passed the House last month .
