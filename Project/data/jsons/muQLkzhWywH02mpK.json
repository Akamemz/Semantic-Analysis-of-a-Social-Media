A nervous New Year 's for Obamacare\nSo January has finally arrived , maybe New Year \u2019 s Eve didn \u2019 t end so well for you , and you \u2019 ve decided to take your brand-new Obamacare coverage out for a test drive .\nExcept \u2014 oops \u2014 maybe your new health insurer doesn \u2019 t have any record of you . Or you didn \u2019 t get the coverage you thought you were getting .\nThe arrival of Jan. 1 will be a big event for President Barack Obama \u2019 s health care law \u2014 the day when Americans across the country can use their new health insurance for the first time . It could be a day of badly needed success stories , if people have a smooth time and sing the praises of their new private health insurance or Medicaid coverage .\nBut it could also be a day of hiccups , and if there \u2019 s any reality to some of the new problems health care analysts have been warning about \u2014 like people who thought they were covered but find out they \u2019 re not , or can \u2019 t sign up in time to replace their canceled coverage \u2014 that \u2019 s when we could start hearing about them .\nIf the Affordable Care Act can get through its first days of actual health coverage without big eruptions , the Obama administration may finally be able to move toward a narrative that focuses on how the law can work . But if it has to spend those days putting out more fires , the phrase \u201c troubled rollout \u201d won \u2019 t be going away anytime soon .\nHere \u2019 s a guide to the \u201c ruh roh \u201d moments health care experts will be watching for next week :\nOne potential problem that \u2019 s getting a lot of White House attention , thanks to all of the canceled health insurance policies , is that there could be people who tried to replace their old coverage with insurance that meets Obamacare standards \u2014 but they couldn \u2019 t get it done in time and they \u2019 ll end up with no coverage on Jan. 1 .\nThe Obama administration estimates that nearly half a million people may not have been able to replace their canceled coverage \u2014 not as many as there could have been , given the larger estimates of all canceled policies , but still a problem . And if they \u2019 re not taken care of , it won \u2019 t take long for the people who suddenly face a lapse in coverage to complain loudly about it and put real faces on the issue .\nThe administration has been scrambling to get on top of that problem . That \u2019 s one reason it suddenly pushed back the enrollment deadline by a day , letting people sign up as late as Tuesday \u2014 rather than Monday \u2014 so anyone stuck in last-minute Web traffic could still get health insurance through the federal Obamacare website .\nLast week , it announced that anyone whose plan was canceled will be able to buy a catastrophic health plan \u2014 a cheaper , scaled-back insurance policy \u2014 if they haven \u2019 t been able to find another replacement .
