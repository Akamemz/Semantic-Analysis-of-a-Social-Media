Paul Ryan assumes the speaker 's job later this week . But he encountered immediate resistance when he laid out the plan Monday night . His plan is for members to vote on the deal Wednesday .\nThe budget pact , in concert with a must-pass increase in the federal borrowing limit , would solve the thorniest issues awaiting Ryan , who is set to be elected speaker on Thursday .\nThe deal would also take budget showdowns and government shutdown fights off the table until after the 2016 presidential election , a potential boon to Republican candidates who might otherwise face uncomfortable questions about messes in the Republican-led Congress .\nCongress must raise the federal borrowing limit by Nov. 3 or risk a first-ever default , while money to pay for government operations runs out Dec. 11 unless Congress acts . The emerging framework would give both the Pentagon and domestic agencies two years of budget relief of $ 80 billion in exchange for cuts elsewhere in the budget .\nOutlined for rank-and-file Republicans in a closed-door session Monday night , the budget relief would total $ 50 billion in the first year and $ 30 billion in the second year .\n`` Let 's declare success , '' House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told Republicans , according to Rep. David Jolly as the leadership sought to rally support for the emerging deal .\nA chief selling point for Republican leaders is that the alternative is chaos and a stand-alone debt limit increase that might be forced on Republicans . But conservatives in the conference who drove Boehner to resign were not ready to fall in line .\n`` This is again just the umpteenth time that you have this big , big , huge deal that 'll last for two years and we were told nothing about it , '' said Rep. John Fleming of Louisiana .\n`` I 'm not excited about it at all , '' said Rep. Matt Salmon , an Arizona Republican . `` A two-year budget deal that raises the debt ceiling for basically the entire term of this presidency .
