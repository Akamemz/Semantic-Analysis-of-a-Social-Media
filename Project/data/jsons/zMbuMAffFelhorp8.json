Each candidate embraced the most self-serving Empire State clich\u00e9 they could glom \u2014 Bernie Sanders trumpeted his Spaldeen-stoopball 1950s Brooklyn upbringing ( while eliding the endemic segregation in his fiercely divided neighborhood ) , Hillary touted her 2000 upstate listening tour ( downplaying her coziness with Wall Street ) , while actual Americans Ted Cruz and John Kasich seemed mesmerized by the wild exoticism of half-sour pickles and matzas .\nOnly Donald Trump \u2014 a \u201c Bonfire of the Vanities \u201d character who has busted out of his tabloid 1980s cage to devour 2016 basic-cable America \u2014 seemed to really get what New Yorkers wanted . Which was to be momentarily amused , then left the hell alone . By necessity ( no riots , please ! ) and instinct ( he has Jeter-esque name recognition already ) the Donald lay lower than in any previous contest and triumphed resoundingly .\nIt was semi-fun while it lasted . Here are five takeaways from the New York primary .\n1 . \u201c Momentum \u201d is for losers . Bernie Sanders cruised into New York riding a wave of victories : He won eight out of the past nine nominating contests . Which all added up to not very much \u2014 he cut Clinton \u2019 s lead in pledged delegates from about 240 to under 200 . The Sanders campaign \u2014 taking a page from Clinton \u2019 s own effort in 2008 \u2014 has been pushing the idea that the Vermont senator was surging past the mathematical impediments to his nomination .\nClinton nearly erased that run with one big win in New York , a victory that her staff expected to net her about 20 to 25 pledged delegates . It also robbed Sanders of a core ( if flawed ) rationale for his candidacy : That Clinton couldn \u2019 t win consistently in big , Northern states \u2014 she can add New York to a column of wins that includes Florida , Texas , Virginia and Ohio .\nAnd late in the day came news that electrified Clinton \u2019 s already-jazzed staff : that Sanders had unexpectedly flown back to Vermont to recharge his political batteries .\n2 . Trump : The mouth that didn \u2019 t roar . Turns out that shutting up , lying low and reorganizing your amateurish campaign ain \u2019 t such a bad idea . Trump , who kicked off his candidacy at Trump Tower on Fifth took the Fifth during his home-state primary \u2014 steering clear of perilously liberal Manhattan to hold rallies in Patchogue on Long Island and Rochester upstate .\nIt may be too late to showcase restraint , but Trump ( who attempted rapprochement with Megyn Kelly during the primary sprint ) used his dead-certain win here as cover to reset his campaign \u2014 layering over bar-bouncer campaign manager Corey Lewandowski with seasoned GOP pro Paul Manafort and flack Hope Hicks with former Scott Walker aide Rick Wiley .\n3 . Bernie and Hillary officially hate each other \u2019 s guts . Here was a hometown contest destined to sow bitterness . Sanders ( like so many other Brooklynites ) professes to be proud of the moxie and street toughness instilled by the borough of his birth , but his first-ever vote was with his feet \u2014 and he got out , first to Chicago , then to the braying-Guernsey environs of Burlington . Still , he feels pride of ownership and bragged ( in Wyoming ) that he would make New York transplant Clinton quake ; Clinton , who parked her carpetbag in Chappaqua 15 years ago , wanted to crush his upstart challenge in her Chappaqua backyard \u2014 and she did .\nClinton won by a wide margin\u2014 and there was much eff-you high-fiving in the ballroom of the Sheraton New York . But Sanders \u2019 defeat ( accompanied , as always by the big crowds and even bigger torrent of online donations ) was the bitterest one yet and deepened the already yawning fault lines between the Bernie stalwarts and a Clinton team increasingly itchy to see him gone . Not going to happen anytime soon , apparently : The tweet being incredulously digested at a Clinton victory party was an MSNBC report quoting Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver defiantly claiming his candidate would take the fight to the convention floor \u2014 even if Clinton secured an overwhelming lead among pledged delegates and supers .\n\u201c We kicked his ass tonight , \u201d a senior Clinton aide told me Tuesday night . \u201c I hope this convinces Bernie to tone it down . If not , f -- - him . \u201d\n4 . Why is John Kasich still running ? Sure , Donald Trump built ( or branded himself on ) over half of Manhattan . But Ohio Gov . John Kasich , the closest thing to a moderate remaining in the Republican field should have appealed to voters here \u2014 and he couldn \u2019 t make the sale in critical areas like Nassau County or suburban Buffalo . At 11 p.m. he was clocking in at a modest 25 percent \u2014 less than half of Trump \u2019 s commanding 60 percent level of victory .\nKasich stands no chance of catching either Trump or Ted Cruz in the delegate hunt\u2014 so his core rationale is that he fares far better than either man in a general election match-up against Hillary Clinton . Losing so badly in her home state , however , does little to bolster that case \u2014 and the trickle of cash coming to his campaign is likely to dry up as he heads into the homestretch .\n5 . Whiteout . Clinton managed to fight Sanders to a virtual draw among white voters statewide ( and won 60-to-40 among whites in the five boroughs ) \u2014 but the big story , for the umpteenth time in 2016 was Sanders \u2019 inability to make significant inroads with black voters . Spike Lee made a nice ad for the Vermont senator \u2014 but it couldn \u2019 t compensate for the candidate \u2019 s repeated ( and inexplicable ) dismissal of Clinton \u2019 s huge wins in the \u201c Deep South \u201d \u2014 which blacks interpreted as a slight .",
