( AP ) \u2014 Trying to prove his political clout by pushing a Republican to victory in a special election , President Donald Trump used a North Carolina rally on Monday to paint a bleak picture of a nation that he claimed would be overrun with crime , poverty and immigrants if Democrats seize power in Washington .\nTrump , appearing at his first campaign rally in nearly a month , went on the offensive in an effort to change a series of late-summer negative headlines over his slipping poll numbers , warning signs of an economic slowdown and a running battle over hurricane forecasts . He urged the Fayetteville crowd to vote Tuesday for Republican Dan Bishop , brandishing his usual incendiary rhetoric to declare from the stage that \u201c tomorrow is a chance to send a clear message to the America-hating left . \u201d\nWhile the stakes for the House are high , Trump \u2019 s trademark rallies inevitably become more about him than the local candidate , as he uses the stage to settle political scores , sharpen attacks and take on perceived foes . With an eye to his own reelection next fall , he touted his administration \u2019 s accomplishments but also urged voters to give him more time .\n\u201c That \u2019 s why we need four more years , \u201d Trump said at the nearly 90-minute rally . \u201c It \u2019 s got to seed \u2014 it \u2019 s a plant . It has to grow . It has to grow those roots . That \u2019 s why 2020 is just as important .

The special election could offer clues about the mindset of Republicans in the suburbs , whose flight from the party fueled the GOP \u2019 s 2018 House election losses .\nThe president enjoys wide popularity within his own party , but a GOP defeat in a red-leaning state could , when combined with a wave of recent bad headlines , portend trouble for his reelection campaign . But before leaving Washington , Trump dismissed questions of whether a poor result for the Republican candidate would serve as a warning sign in next year \u2019 s elections .\n\u201c No , I don \u2019 t see it as a bellwether , \u201d Trump said .\nAfter a light rally schedule of late , the president had plenty of new material to work with .\nChief among them was the White House \u2019 s worries about the impact an economic downturn could have on a president who has made a strong economy his central argument for a second term . Trump advisers worry that moderate Republican and independent voters who have been willing to give him a pass on some of his incendiary policies and rhetoric would blame him \u2014 and , in particular , his trade war with China \u2014 for slowing down the economy .\nTrump offered up a robust defense of the trade war with Beijing . He pushed for Congress to approve his new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal .
