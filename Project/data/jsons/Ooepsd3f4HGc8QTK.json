Hanen issued an injunction halting the entire program .\nHomeland Security officials had gone door to door to try to collect the last of the 2,600 wrongly issued three-year work permits , and in most cases were able to exchange them for two-year permits , which are legal under President Obama \u2019 s 2012 amnesty that granted \u201c deferred action \u201d from deportation to Dreamers .\nBut in 22 cases , the illegal immigrant Dreamers either couldn \u2019 t be found or wouldn \u2019 t turn over their three-year documents .
