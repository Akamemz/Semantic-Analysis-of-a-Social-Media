But a closer look at the numbers and demographics of the \u201c Silver State \u201d reveals something much bigger \u2014 the seeds of a new electorate rising up , and a fundamental realignment of US politics .

Even though it \u2019 s a right-to-work state like much of the Sun Belt , it \u2019 s a labor stronghold with higher than average union density thanks largely to the mighty Culinary Workers Union representing sixty thousand members , and providing the kind of working-class social mobility that \u2019 s all but vanished elsewhere in the United States .\nBut after the economic crash of 2007\u20138 , Nevada was also the state hardest hit by foreclosures and since that time has seen wage growth lower than that of the country at large .

Like the New Deal coalition before him , Sanders \u2019 s success has been based largely on his ability to pull in immigrant workers , who are often new voters , in big numbers .

Not only in terms of race and ethnic demographics but in terms of political composition .\nConsider that the Silver State has a large number of voters disaffected with the Democratic Party . In the last decade alone the number of self-identified non-partisans \u2014 meaning neither Republican nor Democrat \u2014 has grown by 89 percent making up over 20 percent of the total Nevada electorate . While those non-partisans can \u2019 t vote in Nevada \u2019 s closed caucus system , they do reflect a broader trend of voters disgusted by both major parties but endeared toward outsider candidates ( like Sanders ) .\nAnd like the country at large \u2014 but unlike the affluent suburbs around DC and New York \u2014 Nevadans want big changes .
