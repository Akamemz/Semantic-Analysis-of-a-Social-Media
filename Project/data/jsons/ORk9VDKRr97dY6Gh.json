Sign up here .\nPresident Trump on Friday signed a more than $ 2 trillion legislative package to combat the coronavirus pandemic and send economic relief to workers and businesses squeezed by restrictions meant to stop the outbreak \u2019 s spread after the House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved the legislation earlier in the day .\n`` I want to thank Democrats and Republicans for coming together and putting America first , '' Trump said during an afternoon Oval Office signing ceremony .\nTrump marveled at the magnitude of the aid package as he penned his name on the legislation : `` I 've never signed anything with a 'T ' on it , '' Trump quipped of the trillions of dollars of new spending .\nThe legislation , approved by voice vote despite 11th-hour drama arising from a GOP lawmaker \u2019 s objections , amounts to the costliest stimulus plan in U.S. history . It includes checks for most Americans , boosted unemployment aid , help for small business as well as a massive loan fund for corporations \u2013 at a time when unemployment is surging at a record pace , a consequence of businesses closing in compliance with social distancing guidelines .\n\u201c This bill is not only a rescue package , it is a commitment ... that your government and the people whom you elected to serve will do everything we can to limit the harm and hardship you face , both now and in the foreseeable future , \u201d House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy , R-Calif. , said prior to the vote . `` To the American public : If you do your part , I promise we will do ours . ''\nThe approval , while widely anticipated , followed a stretch of uncertainty over whether one congressman -- concerned about the stunning cost of the package -- might be able to stall the vote .\nRep. Thomas Massie , R-Ky. , had furiously objected to a simple voice vote that would have required only a minimal number of lawmakers to travel . Massie , as part of his push , wanted to ensure there is a quorum , which would require half of the members to show up on Capitol Hill .\nSo as President Trump and others accused him of grandstanding , hundreds of lawmakers were summoned to Washington D.C.

But Massie pressed on .\n\u201c I object on the basis that a quorum is not present , \u201d Massie said , instructing a count of lawmakers .\n\u201c A quorum is present and the motion is adopted , \u201d Brown ruled , to applause .\nMinutes before the vote , Speaker Nancy Pelosi took to the floor to summon social-distancing lawmakers at the Capitol in an effort to gather quorum and shut down the Massie effort .\nPelosi touted the aid forthcoming for Americans and small businesses , while acknowledging that more needs to be done for state and local governments and the frontline healthcare workers . She paid homage to a nurse manager , Kious Kelly , who died from coronavirus after serving at a New York City hospital that had to resort to using plastic garbage bags as gowns .\n\u201c We know that this can not be our final bill , \u201d Pelosi said .\nIn a series of speeches prior to the historic rescue bill , lawmakers pressed for national unity despite the bill 's imperfections .\n\u201c We 're going to help Americans through this , '' McCarthy said . `` We 're going to do this together and in the end , we are going to be healthier , stronger and more united than ever before , because as Americans , that 's who we are . \u201d\nUpon catching wind of the plan to stop a roll-call vote , though , Massie howled on Twitter over the parliamentary machinations .\n`` It \u2019 s pretty clear now , with enough members here to pass the bill , that Pelosi and McCarthy are still working together to block a recorded vote just to insulate members of Congress from ACCOUNTABILITY .
