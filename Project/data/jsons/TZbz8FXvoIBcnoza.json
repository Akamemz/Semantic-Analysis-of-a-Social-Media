It was a 9mm handgun .\nIt has been reported in US media that Alshamrani played mass-shooting videos to others at a dinner earlier in the week , according to an anonymous official briefed on the investigation .\nA Twitter user appearing to match Alshamrani 's identity also made a series of anti-US posts before the shooting , an online monitoring group says .\nAlshamrani had also filed a formal complaint against one of his instructors over a nickname which he said had humiliated him .\nAlshamrani alleged the instructor had called him `` Porn Stash '' , an apparent reference to the moustache of a porn actor , in front of 10 other aviation students in April .\n`` I was infuriated as to why he would say that in front of the class , '' Alshamrani wrote in the complaint , the New York Times reported .\nAt a separate press conference on Sunday , Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said the gunman had `` a major social media trail '' and called for more stringent security measures .\n`` This guy was somebody who just had a deep-seated hatred for the United States and that was pretty clear from that , '' he said .\n`` My view is that ... for us to be bringing in these foreign nationals , you have to take precautions to protect the country .
