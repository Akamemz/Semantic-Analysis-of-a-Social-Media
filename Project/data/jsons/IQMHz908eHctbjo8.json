    "content": "The idea of a \u201c decade in review \u201d article at the end of 2019 is a bit of \u201c fake news. \u201d Technically , the current decade does not end until December 31 , 2020 .\nIn that spirit , it is worth looking back at the past ten years through the \u201c fake news \u201d lens . These were years in which the mainstream media used false allegations and biased reporting to suppress conservative voices ; they were also the first years in which , thanks to Andrew Breitbart , we began to resist them .\n2010 : Tea Party \u201c N-word. \u201d The media \u2019 s claimed , based on false allegations by House Democrats , that Tea Party protesters called civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis ( D-GA ) the \u201c n-word \u201d at a demonstration on Capitol Hill against Obamacare . Andrew Breitbart offered $ 10,000 , then $ 100,000 to the United Negro College Fund if anyone could provide video proving the allegation . No one ever did , but the fake news tarnished the Tea Party \u2014 permanently .\n2011 : Sarah Palin and Tucson shooting . The media blamed former Alaska Gov . Sarah Palin for inciting a mass shooting in Tucson , Arizona because her PAC used crosshairs in an ad identifying \u201c targeted \u201d congressional districts , including that of wounded Rep. Gabrielle Giffords ( D-AZ ) . The shooter turned out to be insane . In other fake news , media blamed Tea Party Republicans for the debt limit showdown , though many ultimately would vote to raise it .\n2012 : Mitt Romney \u2019 s taxes , and Benghazi . The media played up sensational accusations that GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney had killed a former employee \u2019 s wife , or failed to pay taxes . These were all untrue \u2014 a fact later justified by former Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D-NV ) , who noted with satisfaction that Romney had lost . The second presidential debate featured a CNN moderator intervening to defend Obama \u2019 s lies about Benghazi .\n2013 : Obamacare collapse . The media mocked and attacked Republicans after Sen. Ted Cruz ( R-TX ) used a \u201c talking filibuster \u201d to shut the government down ahead of the imminent launch of Obamacare . When Obamacare finally opened , however , the federal website did not work ; one state \u2019 s insurance exchange collapsed and never recovered . In subsequent years , households were shocked by rising premiums and unaffordably high deductibles .\n2014 : \u201c Hands up , don \u2019 t shoot. \u201d The media reported \u2014 and celebrated \u2014 the infamously false claim that black teenager Michael Brown had been shot in the back while attempting to surrender to police ; in fact he had grabbed an officer \u2019 s gun and was charging him when he was shot in self-defense . That fake news story damaged race relations and disrupted policing in urban neighborhoods \u2014 ironically , making black Americans more unsafe .\n2015 : Trump remarks on Mexicans and Muslims . In what would become the new template for coverage of Donald Trump , the media claimed that he had called all Mexican immigrants \u201c rapists \u201d in his campaign launch speech , though he had clearly attempted to distinguish between criminals and \u201c good people. \u201d His later call for a \u201c Muslim ban , \u201d likewise , was a response to Islamic terror , not an expression of some innate religious prejudice .\n2016 : Russian intervention in the election . When Trump joked at a press conference , \u201c Russia , if you \u2019 re listening , I hope you \u2019 re able to find the 30,000 e-mails that are missing , \u201d the media \u2014 and the Obama administration \u2014 took that as evidence that he was colluding with Russian attempts to interfere in the election . That led to surveillance of the Trump campaign and to media leaks that planted the seeds of the conspiracy theory that still haunts us to this day .\n2017 : Charlottesville \u201c very fine people \u201d hoax . President Trump condemned violence on all sides ; specifically condemned racism ; then noted that there were \u201c very fine people \u201d among non-violent protesters on both sides of the issue of the removal of a Confederate statue , adding : \u201c I \u2019 m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists , because they should be condemned totally. \u201d The media later said that he had called neo-Nazis \u201c very fine people . \u201d\n2018 : \u201c Kids in cages. \u201d In 2014 , \u2588\u2588\u2588 broke the story that thousands of illegal alien kids were suddenly swamping the border . The media covered the story , but largely ignored that Obama had built chain-link fences in temporary holding facilities . By 2018 , thy claimed Trump was putting \u201c kids in cages \u201d by enforcing existing laws . Latee , the media spread unsubstantiated sexual allegations against Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanagh .\n2019 : Ukraine phone call and impeachment . The Democrats , relying on a second- or third-hand complaint from a so-called \u201c whistleblower , \u201d claimed that president Trump tried to \u201c solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election. \u201d Trump released the rough \u201c transcript \u201d of the call , showing he had done nothing of the sort . The Democrats pressed ahead with impeachment , using the media to publish selective leaks of closed-door testimony .\nNo doubt 2020 will bring more fake news , with an impeachment trial and a presidential election looming \u2014 against the backdrop of the most successful economy in American history .\nWhat Andrew Breitbart called the \u201c Democrat-Media Complex \u201d will be fighting hard , assisted by the censorship of tech giants in Silicon Valley .\nHowever , thanks to him , the American people still have alternative media through which to find the truth , to fight back , and to win .\nJoel B.
