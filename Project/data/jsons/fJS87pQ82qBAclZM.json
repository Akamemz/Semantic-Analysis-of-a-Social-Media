One quibble : Living in a democracy never offered protection from authoritarianism \u2014 democracy has as often been the handmaiden of authoritarianism .\nFor more than a century , we have used \u201c democracy \u201d as a shorthand for good and decent government , and also to indicate a distinctly progressive American view of good government . The founding father of American progressivism , Woodrow Wilson , demanded a war , because , as he said , \u201c The world must be made safe for democracy. \u201d When the American Left speaks about its desire to exercise power over businesses or private life , it says that it wishes to \u201c democratize \u201d this or that enterprise .

The libertarian writer James Bovard famously worried about vulgar majoritarianism , the kind of democracy that amounts to \u201c two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for dinner. \u201d ( The quip often is misattributed to Ben Franklin , among others . ) The American founders by and large feared and despised democracy , which they took from their experience to be a dreary antechamber to anarchy . Democracy in their view was only dominatio plebis , a mutant kind of tyranny but tyranny nonetheless \u2014 not a brake on authoritarianism but authoritarianism itself . This anti-democratic spirit animated the thinking of both of the Presidents Adams , which was philosophically sound but politically disastrous : Each refused to flatter the mob , and they became the first and second presidents to fail to achieve reelection .\nAmerican progressives have had a complicated relationship with the demos . Progressives have simultaneously sought to make American government more democratic by undermining anti-democratic institutions such as the Senate ( which they deformed with direct elections ) and by displacing federalist institutions with nationalist ones ; at the same time , they historically have sought to limit and diminish the role of legislatures , supplanting them with an administrative state under the guidance of experts ( and \u201c experts \u201d ) guided by what American academic pretense has christened \u201c political science. \u201d ( One of the early presidents of the American Political Science Association was none other than Woodrow Wilson of Princeton . ) Progressives who argue for a more parliamentary form of government , longer presidential terms , and longer congressional terms and the like operate within the same contradiction , desiring a government that is both more authentically an expression of majority preferences but also one that is relatively unconstrained by the fickleness of majorities , who are apt to change their minds between one November and the next . That the temporary character of majority preferences could call into question the authenticity and accuracy of any given election as an expression of the popular will is one of those political dilemmas that must be studiously ignored . This is understood by progressives to be a technical challenge for the political scientists rather than a disability .\nAnd if , to take a historical example , the 2.3 million white citizens of Alabama in 1960 wish to oppress the 980,000 black citizens of Alabama , this kind of workaday democracy in action must be understood as a violation of a rarefied higher kind of spiritual democracy rather than the ordinary , predictable , horrifying behavior of human beings operating under a politics of might-makes-right in quantitative form : 50 percent +1 = vox populi , vox Dei .\nThe Democratic party is , for reasons that are obvious enough even from its name , committed to the rhetoric of democracy-as-decency . Among other things , that necessitates that Donald Trump and his presidency be understood as democratically illegitimate , the work of Russian hackers or secret streams of corporate \u201c dark money \u201d or the last gasp of the wicked old Electoral College . Trump stands accused of attempting to weaponize government policy to disadvantage his political enemies by people whose entire party platform is dedicated to weaponizing government policy to disadvantage their political enemies : economically through taxes and regulations that are designed with political outcomes in mind , politically through proposals to muzzle independent political voices by prohibiting financial support for them , etc . American presidential politics is primarily a quasi-religious exercise in Anno Domini 2020 , so set Trump aside for the moment . There is very little doubt that figures often lumped together with Trump as exemplars of the new illiberalism are the result of genuine and robust democratic practices : Narendra Modi is one , with his Bharatiya Janata party winning 303 seats in the 2019 election against 91 for the United Progressive Alliance and 52 for Congress and a combined total of 98 for everybody else . Brexit was the result of a referendum , the most basic of democratic protocols . The election that brought Viktor Orb\u00e1n to power in 2010 was a thoroughly democratic affair , and it was not close .
