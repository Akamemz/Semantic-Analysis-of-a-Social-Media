But consider Abraham Lincoln . From their state of origin to their legal backgrounds , the two presidents have drawn many comparisons , and here \u2019 s another : Despite his various efforts at outreach , our sixteenth president was , in life , an intensely polarizing and partisan figure , every bit as polarizing and partisan as our current president .\nLincoln \u2019 s presidency , which ended exactly 150 years ago today , sharply differed from the experience of his predecessors . Before Lincoln , five presidents had won a second term : George Washington , Thomas Jefferson , James Madison , James Monroe and Andrew Jackson . Each had carried both North and South in at least one of his presidential bids . By contrast , Lincoln was purely a regional candidate , despised by intense majorities in a large chunk of the country . In 1860 , he received zero popular votes south of Virginia , and in 1864 , none of the 11 states in Dixie held a valid presidential election , thanks to sectional war precipitated by Lincoln \u2019 s prior election . Even Lincoln \u2019 s assassination was related to regional differences : John Wilkes Booth was an intense southern partisan .\nIn the ensuing century and a half , many of America \u2019 s most successful presidents have managed to achieve considerable popularity in both North and South . Franklin Roosevelt , Harry Truman , Dwight Eisenhower , John Kennedy , Lyndon Johnson , Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton all outdid Lincoln in this regard . But our current president won , twice , by following a more emphatically Lincolnian path to power\u2014that is , a distinctly northern route : Of the 11 states in the former confederacy , Obama lost eight twice , and lost a ninth ( North Carolina ) once , prevailing twice only in Virginia and Florida .\nIn our era , as in Lincoln \u2019 s , regional polarization is on the upswing . Prior to 1850 , the winning presidential candidate typically carried both North and South . But that pattern broke down in the 1850s , even before Lincoln rose to national prominence ; and a similar fate has befallen Obama . At the presidential level the North and the South have backed different candidates in every one of the six most recent elections ; and many states are becoming increasingly red or blue , presidentially .
