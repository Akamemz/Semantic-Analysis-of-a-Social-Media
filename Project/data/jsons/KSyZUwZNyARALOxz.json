    "content": "The GOP \u2019 s months-long debate over when and how to send a repeal of Obamacare to the president \u2019 s desk now appears to have an answer .\nRepealing the law \u201c root and branch \u201d is probably out of the question , the chamber \u2019 s parliamentarian is hinting , because some parts of Obamacare don \u2019 t affect the federal budget . That \u2019 s a must in order to use the obscure procedure known in Senate parlance as reconciliation , which allows lawmakers to avoid the 60-vote filibuster hurdle and pass bills on a simple majority vote .\nThat \u2019 s not the GOP \u2019 s only problem . Under those rules any Obamacare repeal has to reduce \u2014 not increase \u2014 the deficit . So Republicans will have to pick and choose which parts of the Affordable Care Act they most want to ditch .\nObama will , of course , veto any bill that significantly damages his signature domestic policy achievement . But the entire process has the makings of a difficult political exercise that will reveal something about the GOP \u2019 s priorities when it comes to the reviled law , forcing the party to go beyond the pile-on repeal rhetoric and say specifically what it would do and how it would pay for it .\nRepublicans could try to get rid of the mandates and taxes , but then they \u2019 d have to plug a trillion-dollar hole . Cut the Medicaid expansion to the states ? Sounds simple enough , but then they could put themselves at odds with governors .\nThey \u2019 ll also have to decide if they want to scrap federal Obamacare subsidies , currently on the hot seat across the street at the Supreme Court , which this month will rule whether they \u2019 re constitutional . Gutting them would yield almost a trillion dollars in savings , which could then be used to repeal other parts of the law . But moderates also may experience a political backlash for slashing health care tax credits for poor and middle-class families . Extending or replacing the subsidies , though , could further limit their repeal options and alienate conservatives at the same time .\nThe complex puzzle isn \u2019 t what Republicans who \u2019 ve been vowing for years to abolish the law so despised by the right \u2014 the GOP-controlled House has voted dozens of times to overturn Obamacare \u2014 had in mind . Their vow to get a repeal to Obama \u2019 s desk seemed closer than ever to being realized after Republicans gained control of both chambers of Congress in the midterm elections .\nBut it \u2019 s turning out to be a lot more complicated .\n\u201c We went through this exercise in 2012 , and what we concluded is that [ you can not repeal ] the whole thing , but there are a number of different things that you could knock out : the individual mandate , \u2026 employer mandate , the exchanges , maybe even Medicaid expansion , \u201d said Lanhee Chen , a Hoover Institute fellow who advised Mitt Romney \u2019 s campaign \u2014 which looked into what could and couldn \u2019 t be repealed through reconciliation during the 2012 election cycle .\nThe conundrum has many on the far right urging GOP leaders to take on the Senate parliamentarian , who will ultimately rule what can and can not be repealed through reconciliation , and try to repeal the entire law using a one- or two-line sentence that simply reads : \u201c Repeal the Affordable Care Act . \u201d\nBut policymakers and staff working on the matter are finding it \u2019 s not so straightforward .
