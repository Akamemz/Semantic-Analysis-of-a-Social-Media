    "content": "After much drama and a brief but technical government shutdown , Congress voted to fund the government at roughly 5:30 am Friday \u2014 keeping federal agencies open until the end of March .\nLawmakers extended government funding through March 23 in addition to passing a massive deal to increase investments in domestic programs and the military by roughly $ 300 billion over the next two years , and they increased the debt ceiling for one year . The bill passed at 71-28 in the Senate and 240-186 in the House with bipartisan support .\nCongress actually missed the deadline to fund the government Thursday night after Sen. Rand Paul ( R-KY ) filibustered the spending and budget bill for increasing the national debt too much , technically allowing the government to run out of money for several hours .\nAnd that wasn \u2019 t the only contentious political back-and-forth of the night .\nHouse conservatives mounted a mini revolt when they , like Paul , raised concerns about the massive spending increase . This forced Republican leadership to seek Democratic support in the lower chamber .\nIt was a tough sell for House Democrats . The budget agreement sets aside the question of immigration and what to do about the sunsetting Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) program , which was at the heart of the standoff in January that ended in a three-day shutdown .\nLed by Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , Democrats threatened to shut down the government if House Speaker Paul Ryan didn \u2019 t give assurances of a DACA fix vote . In the end , enough Democrats voted for the spending bill to offset the conservatives who didn \u2019 t vote for it . But they made sure Republicans sweated on the floor , withholding their support until the very last minute .\nPelosi censured Ryan on the House floor saying , \u201c For some reason , I think the speaker thinks he is the speaker of the White House rather than the speaker of the House . \u201d\nRyan , who has refused to give Pelosi firm assurances on immigration , says he will allow a DACA vote as long as it has the president \u2019 s blessing . But negotiations on immigration have largely stalled in the last month , stuck between the moderate-but-passable proposals that the White House won \u2019 t support and conservative Trump-endorsed proposals that won \u2019 t see the light of day in the Senate .\n\u201c My commitment to working together on an immigration measure we can make law is a sincere commitment . We will solve this DACA problem , \u201d Ryan said on the House floor before the vote .\nWith the contentious spending and budget debates off the docket , for now , lawmakers can focus on what will undoubtedly be a difficult immigration debate in the weeks ahead .\nCongress came to an agreement that will fund the government through March 23 . This will give congressional staff the time to write bigger appropriations bills that would actually fund the federal government under the parameters set by the new budget caps .\nThat will amount to significant increases in spending for domestic programs and the military over the next two years .\nExtend funding for the Children \u2019 s Health Insurance Program ( CHIP ) for 10 years\nPut $ 6 billion in funding toward opioid and mental health treatment\nSet aside $ 5.8 billion for the bipartisan Child Care Development Block Grant\nPut $ 4 billion toward the Veterans Administration to rebuild and improve veterans hospitals and clinics\nSend $ 2 billion to research at the National Institutes of Health\nPut $ 20 billion toward infrastructure , including highways , water , wastewater , and rural broadband\nSet aside $ 4 billion for college affordability programs for police officers , teachers , and firefighters\nAnd add $ 7 billion in funding and a two-year reauthorization for community health centers\nThis budget deal is the result of a fight that goes back to 2011 when an Obama-era impasse over the debt ceiling brought the American economy to near calamity . It ultimately resulted in the 2013 sequester : across-the-board budget cuts and budget caps that would amount to $ 1.2 trillion in cuts over the next 10 years .\nCongress has repeatedly voted to raise the budget caps . Since the 2013 sequester , there have been two bipartisan deals to raise the caps by billions of dollars . The first in 2013 was forged between Rep. Paul Ryan and Sen.

But those adjustments , which extended through fiscal year 2017 , had expired .\nWith these budget caps , appropriators \u2014 the lawmakers in charge of the nation \u2019 s purse strings \u2014 can begin putting together a trillion-dollar spending bill that would fund the government through next September .\nMeanwhile , the immigration debate still has a long way to go\nWhen Democrats and Republicans voted to reopen the government in late January , the idea was they would spend the following weeks cobbling together a deal on immigration and more permanent government spending in the weeks ahead .\nBut the actual legislative calendar shrank that window for negotiation , and talks have since increasingly splintered . Now Democrats have voted to fund the government again , hoping negotiations will focus on DACA .\nIn the Senate , Mitch McConnell \u2019 s much-anticipated \u2014 and very mysterious \u2014 immigration floor debate is expected to kick off next week .
