    "content": "The end of U.S. dependence on foreign oil is within reach .\nBy about 2020 , the United States will overtake Saudi Arabia as the world \u2019 s largest oil producer and put North America as a whole on track to become a net exporter of oil as soon as 2030 , according to a report from the International Energy Agency .\nThe change would dramatically alter the face of global oil markets , placing the U.S. , which currently imports about 45 percent of the oil it uses and about 20 percent of its total energy needs , in a position of unexpected power . The nation likely will become \u201c all but self-sufficient \u201d in energy by 2030 , representing \u201c a dramatic reversal of the trend seen in most other energy-importing countries , \u201d the IEA survey says .\nU.S. politics could get in the way of these trends , though .\nControversy swirls around such climate-related proposals as carbon taxes or \u201c cap-and-trade \u201d initiatives , environmental regulations that hamper drilling on public lands , laws against hydraulic fracturing \u2014 also known as fracking \u2014 or other new forms of energy extraction , and political barriers to such projects as the Keystone XL pipeline \u2014 all of which could hamper U.S. energy production but are favored by environmentalists and supporters of President Obama .\nThe IEA report gives the oil and gas sector a powerful talking point when promoting American energy : Keep the federal government out of the way , and energy independence can become reality by the end of this decade .\n\u201c The shale boom in America is just beginning .
