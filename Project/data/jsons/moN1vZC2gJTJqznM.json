I certainly never either sent an email to one or received an email from one , \u201d said Krongard , who served during Rice \u2019 s tenure .\nFurther , he said , \u201c I would have been stunned had I been asked to send an email to her at a personal server , private address . I would have declined to do so on security grounds and if she had sent one to me , I probably would have started an investigation . \u201d\nKrongard noted that during Clinton \u2019 s four-year term , from January 2009 to January 2013 , there was no Senate-confirmed inspector general in place .

''\nKrongard spoke with Fox News before the current State Department inspector general \u2019 s office , led by Steve A.

Many people did . It was not at all unprecedented , '' she said .\nBut , as Krongard indicated , the May 25 IG report clearly stated that Rice did not use personal email for government business . It said Powell used personal email on a limited basis to connect with people outside the department , and he worked with the State Department to secure the system .

He said it would take a deliberate act for the intelligence to `` jump the gap '' between the classified computer networks and Clinton 's personal server .\n`` It could be done by taking a screen shot with \u2026 a camera of a classified email , take a screen shot and send it to an unclassified network .
