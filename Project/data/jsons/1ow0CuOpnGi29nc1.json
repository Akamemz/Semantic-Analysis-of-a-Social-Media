Daniel Fontan , a Cuban exile at the rally , says he sees President Trump as a bulwark against that : \u201c This man is defending me . \u201d\nYet some strategists worry the party \u2019 s failure to take a strong position on Venezuela could cost them . \u201c Foreign policy towards Latin America has always been where the Democrats fall short , \u201d says Helena Poleo , a communications specialist and Venezuelan immigrant .\nNow , with 2020 on the horizon , both parties are ramping up their efforts . Last month , the Democrats dispatched 90 community organizers to Hispanic-heavy precincts , with the goal of registering 200,000 new voters .\nTo win in Florida , Republicans don \u2019 t need a Hispanic majority ; they only need to capture enough votes at the margins . In 2016 , Hillary Clinton won a smaller majority of Latino voters there than Barack Obama in 2012 \u2013 and lost the state to Donald Trump . In 2018 , the GOP flipped a U.S. Senate seat and took the governor \u2019 s mansion in two high-profile races that split the Latino vote more narrowly than in other states with big Hispanic populations .\nThe Democratic debates in Miami , which had spanned four long hours over two nights , were over . And no one had even mentioned the crisis in Venezuela .\nCandidates made obvious plays for Latino voters , says Ms. Poleo , a communications specialist and Venezuelan immigrant who \u2019 ll be voting in the U.S. for the first time in 2020 . Onstage , some vowed to decriminalize illegal border crossings and showed off their Spanish-language skills . Many also took time to visit a nearby migrant children \u2019 s detention center and denounce the Trump administration \u2019 s border policy .\nBut Florida is home to the nation \u2019 s largest Venezuelan population . To Ms. Poleo , the candidates \u2019 failure to address the situation in her home country \u2013 where a struggle over the presidency has fueled an economic crisis that \u2019 s led to starvation and mass migration \u2013 was a stunning disappointment .\nMs. Poleo \u2019 s view , echoed by political observers , underscores one of the challenges facing Democrats in their bid to secure a larger share of Florida \u2019 s Latino electorate in 2020 .\nIt \u2019 s true that Hispanic voters lean Democratic , and Mr. Trump \u2019 s immigration policies aren \u2019 t terribly popular with a majority of them .\nYet the results of recent elections show that the Democratic Party has underperformed in engaging Latino voters here \u2013 enough for Republicans to gain an advantage along the margins . In 2016 , Hillary Clinton won a smaller majority of Latino voters in Florida than Barack Obama did in 2012 \u2013 and she lost the state \u2019 s 29 electoral votes to Donald Trump . In 2018 , the GOP flipped a U.S. Senate seat and took the governor \u2019 s mansion in two very tight , high-profile races that split the Latino vote more narrowly than in other states with big Hispanic populations .\nNow , with 2020 on the horizon , both parties are ramping up their efforts in the state , with Republicans looking to build on their recent victories and Democrats laying the groundwork for a new grassroots push . A strong position on Venezuela and its neighbors , coupled with boots-on-the-ground campaigning , could help tip the scales here , political analysts say .\n\u201c Foreign policy towards Latin America has always been where the Democrats fall short , \u201d says Ms. Poleo , who runs the Miami-based public relations firm Influence Communications . \u201c This is a huge issue . If we don \u2019 t hear the right things from the Democratic candidates , we \u2019 re going to swallow a bitter pill and vote for Trump \u2013 or not vote at all . \u201d\nThough still largely Democratic , Latino voters in Florida have always leaned more Republican than those in other states . About 30 % are Cuban , a population that has historically leaned more conservative than other Hispanics .\nRepublican candidates don \u2019 t need a Hispanic majority to win in Florida ; they only need to capture enough votes at the margins .\nFormer Florida Gov . Rick Scott famously spent years reaching out to a broad range of Latino communities well before he ran for Democrat Bill Nelson \u2019 s long-held U.S. Senate seat in 2018 . He regularly dropped by local Cuban and Venezuelan communities and businesses , flew to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria , and learned to speak Spanish .\nLast November , Governor Scott won the Senate race with 45 % of the Hispanic vote to Mr. Nelson \u2019 s 54 % . In states like Nevada and Arizona , where Democrats won a larger share of the Latino vote statewide , Republican candidates lost their races .\nFlorida state Sen. Annette Taddeo , who also serves as the state committeewoman for the Miami-Dade Democratic Party , says Senator Scott \u2019 s victory shows how crucial it is for Democrats to prove that they don \u2019 t take Hispanic voters , or their issues , for granted . Like Ms. Poleo , she worries that the party isn \u2019 t doing enough to show they care about what \u2019 s happening in Venezuela \u2013 even as the crisis dominates South Florida news coverage , prompts protests , and brings Latinos from different communities together in common cause .\n\u201c It affects the Cuban vote , the Colombian vote , the Nicaraguans , the people who have been here 30 , 40 years and have generations of families voting , \u201d Senator Taddeo says . \u201c While the rest of the country may not be as acutely aware [ of the Venezuelan crisis ] , South Florida is . \u201d\nMeanwhile , the Republican Party has aligned behind the Trump administration against Nicol\u00e1s Maduro , the Venezuelan president whose socialist regime is being threatened by opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 .\nAt the rollout for the Latinos for Trump coalition in Miami on June 25 \u2013 a day before the Democratic presidential debates were set to start less than 10 miles away \u2013 Vice President Mike Pence hit hard against socialism , making it the central theme of his speech . \u201c Latin Americans know better than most about the cost of socialism , \u201d he told the cheering crowd , which included Venezuelan and Cuban exiles and their children . \u201c It \u2019 s impoverished generations and stolen the liberty of millions . \u201d\nDaniel Fontan , a Trump supporter at the rally who fled Castro \u2019 s Cuba in the 1960s , says he has no desire to live in a country like the one he left behind . \u201c People suffered so much , \u201d he recalls .\nHe says he worries the U.S. is marching in that direction as liberals push back against the values that have made America so exceptional . \u201c We are losing traditions . We are not allowed to have faith of any kind .

Despite losing Senator Nelson \u2019 s seat and the governor \u2019 s race , Democrats in Florida scored key wins in Republican-held congressional districts in 2018 .

In June , 90 community organizers \u2013 nearly half of whom speak Spanish \u2013 were dispatched in Hispanic-heavy precincts across the state , with the goal of registering 200,000 new voters for 2020 .
