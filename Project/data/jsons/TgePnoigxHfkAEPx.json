( Gary Cameron/Reuters )\nHow can Americans now trust the intelligence agencies shown to be corrupt in the very recent past ?\nNo doubt Russia must be watched for its chronic efforts to sow more chaos in American elections \u2014 despite Barack Obama \u2019 s na\u00efve assertion in 2016 that no entity could possibly ever rig a U.S. election , given the decentralization of state voting .\nLately the heads of four U.S. intelligence and security agencies \u2014 Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats , FBI Director Chris Wray , Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen , National Security Agency Director Paul Nakasone , and National Security Adviser John Bolton \u2014 held coordinated White House press conferences to remind America of the dangers of Russian chicanery . Trump , who is prone to conflate documented Russian efforts to meddle and cause chaos with unproven accusations of Trump-Russia collusion , should heed their warnings and beef up U.S. counter-espionage efforts and cyber deterrence .\nBut why do our intelligence heads seem to feel so exasperated that they \u2019 re not getting through to the American people ? Why do they need to reassert the immediacy of the Russian threat ?\nThe FBI joined forces with one political campaign to thwart the efforts of the opposing campaign . Has that happened before in American history ?\nIs it because Trump has poisoned the waters of American espionage and surveillance by his understandable furor over the never-ending Mueller investigation and his perceived downplaying of \u201c Russian meddling \u201d ?\nMost recently , it was disclosed , two years after the fact \u2014 and despite the FBI \u2019 s kicking-and-screaming refusal to release subpoenaed documents \u2014 that the FBI did , as alleged , offer to pay Christopher Steele to dig for dirt on the Trump campaign .\nThe FBI also knew that Steele was working on behalf of the Clinton campaign to find dirt on Donald Trump . We now also know that the FBI used at least one informant to spy on members of the Trump campaign . In other words , the FBI joined forces with one political campaign to thwart the efforts of the opposing campaign . Has that happened before in American history ?\nPause for a minute and examine the recent history of the FBI leadership . The fired former director James Comey likely lied frequently to congressional committees when he claimed that the Steele dossier was not really a primary source for the FISA court writ against Carter Page .\nComey did write an FBI summary about the Clinton email scandal , exonerating Clinton , before he interviewed Hillary Clinton and many of the major figures in that scandal . Comey leaked at least one likely classified document , written on FBI equipment on FBI time , in a successful gambit to get a special counsel appointed , which turned out to be his friend Robert Mueller .\nComey misled a FISA judge by not fully disclosing the full origins of the Steele dossier as a product of Hillary Clinton \u2019 s campaign . He also deceived a president by briefing him of selected bits of the dossier \u2019 s contents , but not informing the president that the source of most of that information was paid by the Clinton campaign .\nComey further misled the president by assuring him that he was not a subject of an FBI investigation while he repeatedly suggested to the media that Trump , in fact , was a subject .\nIn addition , Comey must have known that DOJ official Bruce Ohr \u2014 even after the election \u2014 served as a likely conduit to the FBI for info passed to Ohr by then-fired FBI informant Christopher Steele .\nIn other words , during the Trump presidency , one of his own top officials at the DOJ was secretly working with the FBI to undermine the Trump presidency .\nAndrew McCabe , Comey \u2019 s deputy , was fired for misleading or lying to federal investigators . He oversaw the email investigation of Clinton , only months after Clinton \u2019 s associated PACs had provided most of the funds for the political campaign of McCabe \u2019 s wife .\nOther FBI operatives , Lisa Page and Peter Strzok , were fired from the Mueller investigation for unethical and unprofessional behavior \u2014 as well as for rampant bias shown against the target of their own investigations .\nThe CIA under Brennan apparently was knee-deep in efforts to push the FBI to monitor the Trump campaign , despite the fact that domestic surveillance is beyond the CIA \u2019 s legal mandate .\nAn entire array of FBI agents and associated DOJ officials \u2014 James Baker , Peter Kazdik , Michael Kortan , David Laufman , Andrew McCabe , Bruce Ohr , Lisa Page , James Rybicki , Peter Strzok , and Sally Yates \u2014 have now mysteriously either resigned , retired , been reassigned , or been fired for allegedly unethical or perhaps even illegal behavior . And we still do not know the full extent of the FBI \u2019 s use of spies implanted in the Trump campaign\nCurrently , congressional committees are likely to reinvestigate former CIA director John Brennan for serial false testimonies . Brennan has already lied under oath to Congress about the drone program , CIA monitoring of Senate staff computers , and his own role in seeding the Steele dossier to a senator and to DOJ and FBI officials . The CIA under Brennan apparently was knee-deep in efforts to push the FBI to monitor the Trump campaign , despite the fact that domestic surveillance is beyond the CIA \u2019 s legal mandate .\nMembers of the Obama NSC requested a record number of unmaskings of names associated with FISA surveillance .
