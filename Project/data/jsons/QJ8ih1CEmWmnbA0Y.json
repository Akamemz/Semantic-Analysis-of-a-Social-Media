He was born on the land , '' Trump told CNN 's Jake Tapper on `` State of the Union . '' `` Ted was not born on the land , and there 's a very strict reading that you have to be born on the land . ( Harvard Law professor ) Laurence Tribe actually said based on Ted 's views , he would have to be born on the land . ''\nCruz was conferred American citizenship at birth because his mother is an American citizen , and legal experts have largely agreed that would qualify him for natural-born citizenship . The Texas Republican also had Canadian citizenship until he renounced it in 2014 .\n`` He was born in Canada . He was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago , if you can believe that , '' Trump said .\n`` He did n't know . Well , he did n't know about his financial papers either . You know , how are you going to be president if you did n't know about a million dollar loan from Goldman Sachs , '' Trump asked , referring to a controversy that surfaced earlier this week over Cruz 's 2012 Senate bid . `` And you said it 's something you do n't know about . Now he does n't know that he was a Canadian citizen ? I mean that 's in a way maybe worse than all the other things we 're talking about . ''\n`` There have been lawsuits filed . And I said lawsuits are going to be filed , '' he said . `` The Democrats are going to file lawsuits . They filed lawsuits . Now , he 's got a problem . ''\nTrump also hammered Cruz over his criticism of `` New York values , '' which the Texas senator said referred to the Empire State 's support of abortion rights , same-sex marriage and a focus on money and greed . Trump called those remarks `` very , very insulting .
