Arizona \u2019 s state party chairman , Robert Graham , has only one RNC-paid staffer on hand \u2014 and had to fight with the national party to keep that person employed .\nOn Thursday , the RNC released a memo saying it intended to double its field staff in battleground states . Top Senate campaign officials reacted with skepticism , saying that even with the boost promised , the GOP is still behind on the timeline . And in the battleground states , party operatives said they remain unclear the added commitment will bring the ground operations to levels promised in the fall .\nThe source of the problem is a fundraising shortfall months in the making , as an unusually lengthy primary kept big donors focused on preferred candidates rather than organized around the nominee . And , going forward , things might not get easier : With many of the party \u2019 s financiers cool on Trump , how much money the party will raise is an open question . Now the situation , state GOP officials say , is critical .\n\u2014 In New Hampshire , party officials settled on a plan with the RNC to fund 20 field staffers who would be spread out by region , according to two people familiar with the budget , one of whom read the document to \u2588\u2588\u2588 . They would be accompanied by a handful of regional directors and a few others who would be responsible for such things as data maintenance and communications help . At this point , though , New Hampshire Republicans say they \u2019 ve gotten virtually no field workers .\n\u2014 In Ohio , where Trump is banking on a win and GOP Sen . Rob Portman finds himself in a treacherous reelection contest , the RNC had promised to fund more than 170 field staffers to arrive by July 1 , according to multiple party operatives . At this point , there \u2019 s only around 25 . \u201c If you \u2019 re on the ballot in Ohio this year , it \u2019 s a real concern , \u201d said Kevin DeWine , a former Ohio Republican Party chairman . \u201c It needs to get fixed fast , and hurry to give voters and donors a sign that Trump plans to compete and contest in Ohio . \u201d\n\u2014 In Wisconsin , state Republicans and the national party agreed on a sweeping ground program that would place nearly 100 RNC-funded field staffers across the state , according to one person who helped to finalize the plan . At this point , though , the state party counts only a handful of organizers , a small team of regional staffers , and a few others .\n\u2014 In Pennsylvania , party officials had hoped for more than 175 RNC-sponsored field staffers but now have only a small fraction of that , according to senior state party official and a national party official .\n\u2014 In Florida , the state party had been operating on the understanding that at least 100 RNC-paid staffers would be in place by July . Now , they count only around 30 , according to a former state party official involved in reviewing the budget and a current national party official .\n\u2014 In North Carolina , the promise was at least 100 RNC-paid field staff , yet Republicans there have only around half of that , according to a senior party operative in the state and a national party official .\n\u2014 Colorado party chairman Steve House said the RNC currently had around a dozen field staffers in the state . He described the figure as \u201c slightly behind schedule \u201d but wouldn \u2019 t comment further .\nMeanwhile , Democrats appear to be expanding on their infrastructure advantage . While side-by-side comparisons are inexact because Democrats coordinate their ground game differently from Republicans , few Republicans dispute that they face an uphill climb .\nIn Florida , the Democratic National Committee has more than 80 field staff on the ground , and state party executive director Scott Arceneaux projected a team of close to 200 by the middle of June . In Ohio , there are more than 70 full-time field staffers working the state . In New Hampshire , there are 25 , with at least 60 expected to be crisscrossing the state by July .\nAnd in Arizona , Democrats have 67 field staff in place , and have a goal of reaching 200 by August , according to the state party chair .\n\u201c Arizona is sometimes taken for granted as a red state , but if Republicans and the national party aren \u2019 t careful that will no longer be the case , \u201d said Chad Heywood , a former Arizona Republican Party executive director .\nThe staff crunch comes down to money . The long primary season delayed until last week the party \u2019 s formation of a joint fundraising agreement with Trump , which enables him to raise money for the RNC in large increments . Even as he begins holding his first fundraisers for the party , there \u2019 s deep-rooted uncertainty that Trump will be able to raise the $ 1 billion many GOP operatives say they think he \u2019 ll need . Last month , the committee reported having just $ 16 million , a fraction of what it had at the same point in the 2008 and 2012 campaigns .\nIn an interview , Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker , the National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman , praised RNC Chairman Reince Priebus for his oversight at a politically complex time for the party but acknowledged the shortfall .\n\u201c I \u2019 m sure he \u2019 d like to have more money , \u201d he said , \u201c and so would I . \u201d\nBehind the scenes , Priebus has gone on defense . On Tuesday evening , the chairman appeared at a semi-regular gathering of prominent Republican operatives , lobbyists and donors . At the dinner , hosted by veteran lobbyist Rick Hohlt at the Hay-Adams hotel , Priebus launched into a protracted defense of his efforts to improve the party \u2019 s field organization .\nDuring his remarks , according to one person present , Priebus pointed to Ohio and Florida as two states where the RNC had upped its investments from the 2012 campaign , when it found itself outmatched by Democrats . He said reporters are scrutinizing the durability of the party \u2019 s get-out-the vote efforts and walked the group of strategists \u2014 many of them tasked with helping to oversee critical congressional races \u2014 through a numbers-filled presentation , aiming to assure them that the party is on safer ground .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 reached out to the RNC for comment on Wednesday , requesting a breakdown of how many field staffers it had in swing states , how many it had promised state parties , and how many it had in comparison to 2012 . The committee did not respond to the request or to a followup . On Thursday afternoon , it provided a memo to The Hill in which it promised to double the number of field staff in 11 battleground states and increase the number of paid staff in battleground states from 216 to 466 .\nSeveral top Senate campaign strategists said they received no advance word of the memo .
