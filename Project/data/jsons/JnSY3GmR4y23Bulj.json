( Lucas Jackson/Reuters )\nAll night long , almost every candidate on stage aimed their attacks at Joe Biden . Early on , Kamala Harris referred to him as \u201c Senator Biden , \u201d a perhaps not-so-accidental demotion . Julian Castro , Bill de Blasio , and Cory Booker all went after him in rapid succession . Even Kirsten Gillibrand claimed that Biden opposed women working outside the home , a particularly implausible accusation .\nHere \u2019 s the good news for Biden : If tonight doesn \u2019 t do any damage to his numbers , he will probably cruise to the nomination . This is life as the frontrunner \u2013 you get attacked by everybody , all the time , on any issue that they think will get them some traction . Biden got socked in the jaw in the first debate , lost some ground in the subsequent polls , but gradually floated back to a solid lead . With the vast majority of Democrats living today having voted for him twice as vice president , and generally liking him and not all that bothered by long-ago not-so-progressive positions , all Biden has to do is not fumble .\nThe weirdest aspect of the attacks on Biden was the suggestion that the Obama presidency was some sort of right-wing nightmare , full of draconian deportation enforcement , Americans desperately yearning for health care and having no way to get it , a Department of Justice that shrugged at police abuses . . . almost everyone assumes that Barack Obama will remain on the sidelines during this primary process . But if Biden is the lone defender of the Obama legacy , and every other upstart is painting the previous presidency as a failure , maybe Obama will come out and formally endorse his old wingman .\nBiden may have done himself some good for the general election , if he gets there . At one point during the debate on immigration , Biden declared , \u201c The fact of the matter is , you should be able to , if you cross the border illegally , you should be able to be sent back . It \u2019 s a crime. \u201d In today \u2019 s Democratic party , that \u2019 s a wildly controversial , reactionary statement . Trump will paint Biden as soft on illegal immigration ; Biden will be able to say he stood up for immigration law enforcement when those around him didn \u2019 t want to hear it .\nKamala Harris \u2019 s playbook was clear : attack Biden , attack Biden , attack Biden . But you wonder if the folks watching at home \u2014 to the extent they felt like watching three hours \u2014 started to tire of her relentless focus on Biden . Tonight , she let out all of her prosecutorial instincts . Every other answer was some version of , \u201c you \u2019 re just wrong on this , Mr. Vice President . The reality is . . . \u201d Harris is tough on offense but much shakier on defense . Some Democrats in this field appear to be having serious second thoughts about Medicare for All , and Harris looked incapable of defending her plan with any specificity .\nOne of the more dramatic moments in the second hour came when Tulsi Gabbard went after Harris hard on the less flattering parts of her record as prosecutor : \u201c She put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana . . . When you were in a position to impact these people \u2019 s lives you did not and worse yet in the case of those on death row , innocent people , you actually blocked evidence that would have freed them , until you were forced to do that , and the people who suffered under your reign as prosecutor , you owe them an apology. \u201d Brutal . Those of us who studied her prosecutorial record early know there is more controversy , but all of this is probably news to a lot of the Democrats watching at home .
