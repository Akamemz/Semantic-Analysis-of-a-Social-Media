The impeachment of President Donald Trump is under way , and I \u2019 ve asked the Speaker of the House if she thinks it \u2019 s the most important thing she \u2019 ll ever do . We \u2019 re sitting in her elegant office in the Capitol , on gold-upholstered armchairs around a low table topped with a vase of hydrangeas . Over her shoulder , the sweeping view of the National Mall is shrouded in wintry clouds . For a long moment , the Speaker goes silent as she seems to compile in her mind the list of accomplishments she \u2019 d rather claim as her legacy .\n\u201c Apart from declaring war , this is the most important thing that the Congress can do , \u201d she finally says . \u201c I \u2019 m most proud of the Affordable Care Act . But this is the most serious initiative that I \u2019 ve been involved in in my career . \u201d\nPelosi has spent decades at the highest levels of politics , but the past 12 months have been arguably her most consequential . Returning to the speakership after eight years running the House Democratic minority , she established herself as counterweight and constrainer of this divisive President . She outmaneuvered Trump on policy , from the border wall he didn \u2019 t get to the budget agreement he signed loaded with goodies that Democrats wanted . She oversaw an unprecedented litigation effort against the Executive Branch , racking up landmark court victories . And she was the tactician behind the investigation that resulted in Trump \u2019 s impeachment on Dec. 18 .\nWhat is most striking about this moment in Pelosi \u2019 s career is that at the peak of power , she is not protecting her position but rather using it in aggressive , even risky ways . Impeaching Trump is a gamble for Pelosi . It has intensified Republicans \u2019 fealty to the President , rallying his base and supercharging his campaign fundraising , potentially increasing his re-election chances . The polarizing effort could jeopardize Democrats who hold seats in Trump territory , and thereby endanger Pelosi \u2019 s House majority . With impeachment , Pelosi is betting her own place in history .\nPelosi has always been a risk-taker , from defying Chinese authorities by protesting at Tiananmen Square in 1991 to pushing Obamacare through the House with nary a vote to spare in 2010 . But she is careful to cast impeachment not as a political gambit but as a project to preserve the checks and balances of American democracy . \u201c That \u2019 s my responsibility : to protect the Constitution of the United States , \u201d she says .\nThat battle is playing out on multiple fronts . As Congress returned and Trump launched the country into a potential conflict with Iran , Pelosi sought to rein him in . The House planned to vote Jan. 9 on a war powers resolution designed to limit the President \u2019 s ability to escalate the conflict . The behind-the-scenes court battle that Pelosi has field-marshaled aims not just to check Trump \u2019 s current power grabs , but also to set precedents that will stop future Presidents from doing the same , or worse .\nAnd to Trump \u2019 s annoyance , Pelosi is declining to transmit the House \u2019 s two impeachment articles to the Senate . Instead of allowing Republican Senators to end the impeachment discussion with a quick vote , she is insisting that the upper chamber agree on rules for the trial first . \u201c That doesn \u2019 t mean it has to meet my standards . When we see what [ Mitch McConnell ] has in mind , we will be prepared to send over \u201d the articles , she tells TIME on Jan. 8 , in her first public comments about the standoff . \u201c We \u2019 ve upped the ante on this . \u201d\nPelosi has told colleagues she \u2019 s had to wear a night guard because the White House makes her grind her teeth in her sleep . But her frustration is born of determination , not unease . In our interview , I asked her if the President \u2019 s nickname for her , Nervous Nancy , is accurate . \u201c Pfft , \u201d she says , waving a hand . \u201c He \u2019 s nervous . Everything he says , he \u2019 s always projecting . He knows the case that can be made against him . That \u2019 s why he \u2019 s falling apart . \u201d\nGet our Politics Newsletter .

After Pelosi orchestrated Democrats \u2019 2018 midterm wins , an insurgent faction of the caucus moved to replace her with a younger , \u201c less polarizing \u201d figure . Pelosi squashed the uprising with characteristic discipline . Over the ensuing year , instead of holding grudges , she set to holding her diverse caucus together when ideology and identity threatened to splinter it .\nFor months , the Democrats \u2019 biggest division was over impeachment . As colleagues and activists agitated for it , Pelosi spent most of the year resisting on the grounds that it could tear the country apart\u2013and hurt her party . All the while , however , she was laying the groundwork behind the scenes to build a case if necessary . \u201c It seemed like all of a sudden we were unified around an impeachment inquiry , \u201d says Representative Katherine Clark of Massachusetts , the vice chair of the Democratic caucus . \u201c But that was Nancy Pelosi using individual members and where they were to bring this to a\u2013she always uses this word\u2013a crescendo . So what appears to all of a sudden be a big moment is actually based on months of work . \u201d\nFrom start to finish , Pelosi has kept a tighter rein on the proceedings than the public realized , from major strategic decisions to minor stagecraft . It was Pelosi who decreed that the Intelligence Committee would take the lead in the inquiry , even though impeachment is generally considered to be the Judiciary Committee \u2019 s purview . ( Past Judiciary hearings had devolved into a circus\u2013particularly a Sept. 17 session in which the President \u2019 s former campaign manager , Corey Lewandowski , openly mocked the proceedings . ) It was Pelosi who decided that the Democrats \u2019 hashtag for impeachment , # TruthExposed , seemed too harsh ; they settled on # DefendOurDemocracy instead .\nPelosi refereed contentious disputes between chairmen with discretion . She signed off on every committee report and press release ; aides say she caught typos in the Intelligence Committee \u2019 s final report before it went out . She decreed that the articles of impeachment would be limited to Trump \u2019 s actions in Ukraine rather than incorporating matters related to special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s investigation , as some of her members wanted . When Judiciary Committee lawyers debated whether to spend half a day of hearings on a presentation related to Mueller \u2019 s obstruction-of-justice probe , they appealed the question to the Speaker , noting that the staff was split . \u201c Tell them I \u2019 m not split , \u201d she replied , rejecting the idea . And while she allowed the committee \u2019 s final report to contain references to Mueller \u2019 s investigation , she demanded they be deleted from the accompanying announcement .\nNo aspect of the spectacle was too small to escape Pelosi \u2019 s control . When the Intelligence Committee held its public impeachment hearings in November , Pelosi noticed that chairman Adam Schiff \u2019 s head reached nearly to the top of his high-backed chair . After Intelligence finished its work , Judiciary , chaired by Representative Jerry Nadler , was slated to hold hearings in the same room . Pelosi thought if he sat in the same chair , Nadler\u2013a head shorter than Schiff\u2013would look small .\nPelosi sent word down : there would have to be a change of furniture . And when Judiciary convened on Dec. 4 , Nadler was seated in a leather-backed chair that reached no higher than his ears .\nPelosi meets with Representatives Richard Neal and Adam Schiff and House counsel Doug Letter in her office on December 5 . Philip Montgomery for TIME\nImpeachment was the culmination of Pelosi \u2019 s broader effort to hold Trump in check . For the past year , she has overseen investigations by six different congressional committees digging into everything from Trump \u2019 s tax returns and allegations of Administration corruption to foreign emoluments and the Russian entanglements Mueller helped uncover . Congressional committees tend to be territorial , but Pelosi convened the six committees \u2019 chairmen weekly , and sometimes more often , to ensure they didn \u2019 t duplicate efforts or step on one another \u2019 s toes .\nShe has also guided a far-reaching effort to rein in Trump through the courts . She hired a 40-year Justice Department veteran , Douglas Letter , to head the House general counsel \u2019 s office , a secretive team of nine lawyers , and confers with him on every legal filing , every subpoena . Together they have chosen cases designed to set precedents that affirm Congress \u2019 powers and shore up the institution . \u201c She \u2019 s calling the shots , \u201d Letter tells TIME , in a rare interview . Starting with his job interview , Letter says , Pelosi correctly predicted that \u201c we would get stonewalled \u201d by Trump and his lawyers , and would have to litigate in the courts more than usual . \u201c She insisted we would try to pick , particularly for subpoena enforcement , really good cases . \u201d\nCourts tend to view litigation between the Legislative and Executive branches with unease . Judges are leery of refereeing what they view as essentially political disputes . But Pelosi and Letter \u2019 s approach has produced a string of victories . Courts have ruled in favor of releasing Trump \u2019 s tax returns and other financial records , compelled the release of grand-jury materials from the Mueller investigation and dismissed the Administration \u2019 s arguments for blocking witnesses . In a blistering November opinion , U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson ruled that Donald McGahn , Trump \u2019 s former White House counsel , must testify , and that the Administration \u2019 s argument to the contrary \u201c simply has no basis in the law. \u201d She added , \u201c The primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that Presidents are not kings . \u201d\nAs those court cases got tied up in appeals , though , progress in the courts did little to satisfy those eager to use the ultimate tool of presidential accountability . Pelosi resisted impeachment throughout the summer , even as more and more members of her caucus endorsed it . \u201c Many of them were out there for impeachment like a year ago , right after we won , \u201d she says , but she insisted on moving deliberately in order to make the strongest possible case . \u201c I said we \u2019 ll go down this path when we \u2019 re ready , \u201d Pelosi says . She told her colleagues that they had to wait for the investigation and litigation to play out .\nThe frustration built outside of Congress too . In her San Francisco district in August , Pelosi appeared at a banquet in her honor\u2013the \u201c Heart of the Resistance \u201d dinner . She had barely begun to speak when a group of young activists rose in the back , standing on chairs and unfurling black fabric banners with white lettering . time to IMPEACH , they said . WE CAN \u2019 T WAIT . A young woman shouted , \u201c People are being killed by white supremacists ! \u201d A man said , \u201c We are your constituents ! \u201d As the crowd chanted , \u201c Let her speak , \u201d a burly labor organizer got in the activists \u2019 faces , and for a moment it seemed as if they might come to blows before hotel security escorted the protesters out .\n\u201c It \u2019 s O.K. , \u201d Pelosi said from her position at the front of the room . \u201c I \u2019 m going to speak . I \u2019 m the Speaker of the House ! \u201d When she did speak , however , the word impeachment did not escape her lips .\nPelosi 's desk in her office at the Capitol on December 5 . Philip Montgomery for TIME\nA few weeks later , the Ukraine scandal changed the short-term politics and the long-term stakes . In mid-September , media outlets started to report that Trump had tried to bully his Ukrainian counterpart , Volodymyr Zelensky , into publicly announcing an investigation of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden , using White House access and congressionally approved foreign aid as leverage . His actions had alarmed government officials , leading an intelligence-community whistle-blower to file a secret complaint .\nTrump had applied the pressure during a phone call in July , the day after Mueller testified before Congress . To House Democrats , it seemed Trump was setting a dangerous precedent of presidential impunity , soliciting foreign assistance in the 2020 election just as he \u2019 d been accused of doing in 2016 . \u201c I was one of those who were very reluctant to proceed \u201d with impeachment , says Representative Ed Perlmutter , a Democrat from Colorado who is close to Pelosi despite trying to block her from the speakership after the 2018 midterms . \u201c But putting people \u2019 s lives at risk by holding up that aid money , extorting the Ukrainian President to do the political bidding of the President\u2013that was something that changed the calculation for everybody . \u201d\nPelosi had already begun preparations toward impeachment when , at 5 p.m. on Monday , Sept. 23 , she took a call from a group of seven freshman Democrats . All of them had military and intelligence backgrounds ; all had flipped Republican districts ; all had opposed impeachment to this point . Now they told her they were jointly writing an op-ed , to appear that evening on the Washington Post \u2019 s website , endorsing an impeachment inquiry . \u201c We have devoted our lives to the service and security of our country , \u201d the op-ed read . \u201c These allegations are stunning , both in the national security threat they pose and the potential corruption they represent . \u201d\nFlying back to Washington from New York City that night , Pelosi began drafting an announcement in her looping cursive hand on a piece of loose-leaf paper . The next morning , the Speaker was in her airy Georgetown penthouse condo when she received an unscheduled call from the President . It was 8:16 a.m. Trump was in New York , preparing for a speech to the U.N . The subject of the call was ostensibly gun control , a topic dear to Pelosi \u2019 s heart . But that turned out to be a pretext .\nTrump quickly turned to the subject of the July 25 Zelensky conversation . There was \u201c no pressure at all , \u201d he insisted , according to a source familiar with the conversation between Pelosi and the President . The call was \u201c 100 % perfect . I didn \u2019 t ask him for anything. \u201d Trump added , \u201c Literally , you would be impressed by my lack of pressure . \u201d\nPelosi was unconvinced . \u201c Mr . President , \u201d she said , \u201c we have a problem here. \u201d She repeatedly urged the President to release the still hidden whistle-blower complaint that had set off the controversy . And she reminded him that as the longest-serving member of the House Intelligence Committee , this allegation was \u201c in my wheelhouse. \u201d As the conversation grew tense , she urged him one more time to release the complaint . \u201c I have to go give a speech , \u201d Trump said , and hung up .\nTo Pelosi , Trump \u2019 s belief that the Zelensky call was \u201c perfect \u201d showed an inability to distinguish right from wrong . For months , she had believed voters in the 2020 election should be the ones to remove Trump from office . Now she was increasingly convinced it would be dangerous to allow him to continue his term without rebuke .\nAt 4 p.m. that afternoon , she met with her caucus and outlined her plan to announce an impeachment inquiry . There were no objections . As her 5 p.m. announcement drew near , an aide tugged at her sleeve , urging her to go upstairs and run through the speech just once before she went out and delivered it . Finally she turned on him , snapping , \u201c I walk into rooms and read teleprompters all the time . That \u2019 s what we \u2019 ll do . \u201d\nThen it was time to face the cameras for history . \u201c The actions taken to date by the President have seriously violated the Constitution , \u201d Pelosi said . \u201c The President must be held accountable . No one is above the law . \u201d\nIn a televised address given at the Capitol on the morning of December 5 , Pelosi announces that the House of Representatives will begin drafting articles of impeachment . Philip Montgomery for TIME\nNow that the House has impeached Trump in a nearly party-line vote , it \u2019 s fair to ask how much Pelosi \u2019 s careful management of the process achieved . The Senate Republican leader , Mitch McConnell , has declared he will work to ensure Trump is acquitted . McConnell \u2019 s Democratic counterpart , Chuck Schumer , seems to agree that Trump \u2019 s acquittal is a foregone conclusion . \u201c I don \u2019 t want to second-guess \u201d the outcome , Schumer tells TIME . \u201c But these Republicans are not the Republicans of old . They are totally supine in their obeisance to Trump. \u201d Yet Schumer agrees with Pelosi that \u201c we have no choice , given the President \u2019 s lack of respect for democracy and the Constitution . \u201d\nRepublicans gloat that impeachment has strengthened Trump politically\u2013that somehow , a process designed by the founders to constrain a President has perversely achieved the opposite . Trump \u2019 s re-election campaign has harnessed his supporters \u2019 outrage over impeachment to raise buckets of money . As the drama played out over the final three months of 2019 , Trump raked in $ 46 million , his best quarterly haul of the year and more than any of his Democratic rivals have raised over a similar period . Within 72 hours of Pelosi \u2019 s Sept. 24 announcement that Democrats would move forward with an impeachment inquiry , the Trump campaign pulled in $ 15 million in small-dollar donations .\nCritics accuse Pelosi of caving to pressure and violating her own conditions to pursue Trump \u2019 s impeachment . Even Republicans who aren \u2019 t big Trump fans have \u201c been sort of driven toward him by this\u2013they do feel that Democrats overplayed their hand , \u201d says Representative Peter King , a New York Republican . \u201c This whole thing has been a rush to judgment . \u201d\nBut Pelosi \u2019 s allies say holding out until the Ukraine scandal broke strengthened her hand . \u201c It \u2019 s made her an even more powerful voice in this moment , \u201d says Representative David Cicilline , Democrat of Rhode Island . \u201c She resisted this for so long because she really understood the consequences to the country . That gives her tremendous credibility with the American people when she came to the conclusion it was necessary . \u201d\nPelosi prepares for a press conference on December 5 as an aide looks on . Philip Montgomery for TIME\nIt \u2019 s an open question whether Pelosi \u2019 s gamble has the public \u2019 s support . In polls , a slight plurality of Americans\u2013just over 49 % \u2013support Trump \u2019 s impeachment , according to averages tabulated by FiveThirtyEight . That number shot up after the scandal began , and is historically high , but it has barely budged since October , and Trump \u2019 s approval rating has remained steady in the low 40s as well . Democratic pollster Geoff Garin says that despite GOP claims to the contrary , \u201c there \u2019 s no evidence that impeachment has changed the fundamental dynamics of the 2020 election. \u201d Trump \u2019 s opponents , he contends , are even more galvanized by impeachment than his supporters are . And by November 2020 , Garin says , the data suggest that voters will base their decisions far more on issues like health care than on impeachment .\nIn mid-December , I sat down with Pelosi again and asked her to respond to some of the criticism of the process . The Speaker was battling a lingering winter cold , and was in the midst of last-minute negotiations with the White House and Senate on a $ 1.4 trillion spending deal to avert a shutdown while sharply cutting back Trump \u2019 s requested border funding .\nThe idea of a rush to impeachment exasperates the Speaker , who points out that the White House limited the evidence available with its unprecedented stonewalling . And Pelosi contends that the process is merely an extension of the prior investigations of Trump . \u201c This has been going on for 2\u00bd years , since the Justice Department tasked Director Mueller to go into the investigation , \u201d she says . \u201c It \u2019 s been going on for a long time . The aha moment was Ukraine . But the pattern of behavior was very self-evident over time . \u201d\nMany Democrats hoped some Republicans might support impeachment ; Pelosi claims nothing ever surprises her . \u201c It \u2019 s disappointing to see that they are ignoring their own oath of office , \u201d she says . \u201c The President must be held accountable . And the fact that the Republicans are even in denial of the factual basis of what happened is sad for our country . \u201d\nOn Dec. 17 , the night before the full House would debate and vote on Trump \u2019 s impeachment , Pelosi met behind closed doors with top caucus members on the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee . She hinted , for the first time , that she was contemplating a curveball : declining to immediately transmit the impeachment articles to the Senate after the House passed them . \u201c The rule empowers the Speaker to be able to decide how to send the articles and when to send the articles over to the Senate , \u201d she said , according to an aide who was in the room . \u201c My view is we don \u2019 t know enough about what they are going to do . We want to see what [ is ] their level of fairness and openness and the rest . \u201d\nPelosi , according to an aide , had been mulling the tactic since she heard former Nixon White House counsel John Dean float the idea on CNN on Dec. 5 . In the committee meeting , she added that she believed McConnell would be motivated to move . \u201c Somebody said to me today that he may not even take up what we send . [ But ] then [ Trump ] will never be vindicated , \u201d she said , according to the aide in the room . \u201c He will be impeached forever . Forever . No matter what the Senate does . \u201d\nThe following day , Pelosi presided over the floor vote on impeachment , wearing a striking black suit to project solemnity , accessorized with a large gold brooch of the Mace of the Republic , a symbol of the House . When scattered cheers broke out inside the chamber after the first article was approved , she sternly and silently shushed them with a glare and a sharp gesture . After the vote , she announced that she did not plan to transmit the articles right away , saying she could not determine how to appoint House impeachment managers until the Senate decides on its rules for the trial .\nMcConnell has mocked the idea that Pelosi or Schumer can shape the Senate trial to their liking . But he \u2019 s also said he won \u2019 t start it until Pelosi sends the articles , and it \u2019 s clear from Trump \u2019 s tweets and statements that the unresolved situation bothers him . Moreover , the delay is allowing facts to emerge . Over the two-week holiday break , newly unredacted emails showed Pentagon officials worrying about the legality of Trump \u2019 s effort to withhold military aid from Ukraine . And on Jan. 6 , former National Security Adviser John Bolton , potentially a key witness to Trump \u2019 s alleged actions toward Ukraine , announced he would testify before the Senate if subpoenaed . On Jan. 7 , McConnell announced that he had enough Republican votes to begin the trial , and Democrats in both chambers appeared to be getting restless\u2013but still Pelosi refused to budge .\nThe gambit is reminiscent of another Pelosi maneuver designed to exploit Trump \u2019 s insecurities . Pelosi retook the speakership a year ago amid a government shutdown triggered by Trump \u2019 s demand for border-wall funding . She refused to negotiate on the matter until the government reopened . As the stalemate dragged on , Pelosi seized on an unexpected source of leverage : she postponed Trump \u2019 s State of the Union address to Congress , knowing that he prized it as a televised set piece showcasing his power .\nThen she stubbornly waited out her adversary . \u201c The President tried to break us in January [ 2019 ] by throwing us into a government shutdown at the same time we were transitioning into the majority , \u201d says Hakeem Jeffries , a Democratic Congressman from New York who serves as caucus chairman . \u201c We held together , and instead of breaking us , we broke him . It ended in unconditional surrender . \u201d\nPelosi meets with her staff on Capitol Hill on December 5 . Philip Montgomery for TIME\nThis power struggle between the branches of government was not Pelosi \u2019 s vision . She preferred the emphasis to be on the Democrats \u2019 policy agenda . She believed that kitchen-table concerns were more important to voters and wanted to show that Democrats are capable of governing . Despite Trump \u2019 s criticism of the \u201c do-nothing Democrats , \u201d the House has passed nearly 400 bills , most with GOP support . If there \u2019 s a single morning that captures how Pelosi has juggled the priorities of policymaking and oversight , it is Dec. 10 , when she led the 9 a.m. announcement of the impeachment articles , then proceeded directly to a 10 a.m. press conference to announce that the House had made a deal to pass the President \u2019 s revision of the North American Free Trade Agreement .\nHer approach is a stark departure from how the GOP handled Barack Obama \u2019 s presidency\u2013opposing Obama at every turn , determined not to give him victories even on uncontroversial matters . Pelosi and Schumer have found ways to work with Trump , particularly on trade , prescription drugs and infrastructure , an approach that rankles the left . \u201c Democrats should not be giving Donald Trump wins that normalize his presidency and give him a set of accomplishments to campaign on , \u201d says Brian Fallon of the liberal group Demand Justice . \u201c He benefits vastly more from a bipartisan trade deal than they do. \u201d In a stroke of irony , the Speaker whose moderate colleagues tried to get rid of her for fear she struck heartland voters as too far left is now hailed\u2013or derided\u2013as a moderating force .\nYet House Democrats from all wings of the diverse caucus say they are more unified than at any time in recent memory . \u201c I think we \u2019 re doing the very best we could , \u201d says Representative Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania , one of the authors of the national-security freshmen \u2019 s op-ed . Liberal Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York , agreed : \u201c It \u2019 s been a very disciplined approach . \u201d\nThat comity will be tested as Washington heads into an election year . More is at stake than the balance between the parties . The institutions of American democracy are being tested . The checks and balances designed by the founders depend on the coequal branches \u2019 ability to stand up to one another . \u201c She \u2019 s had a herculean task , and she \u2019 s done it brilliantly , \u201d says Jonathan Rose , a former Nixon and Reagan Administration lawyer affiliated with the anti-Trump conservative legal group Checks and Balances . \u201c I never thought I \u2019 d be for Nancy Pelosi in my lifetime . \u201d\nPelosi , for her part , won \u2019 t admit to any preference for her party \u2019 s 2020 nominee . But the Speaker , as usual , has a strategy for how she believes the Democrats should proceed . \u201c The message has to be one that is not menacing , \u201d she says . \u201c What works in Michigan works in San Francisco , about job creation and the rest . But what works in San Francisco may not work in Michigan . Michigan is where we must win , and we must win in the Electoral College . We won the House last year by having mobilization at the grassroots level . We have to do that again. \u201d The question for Democrats now may have less to do with the effects of Pelosi \u2019 s actions than whether they heed her advice .\nThis appears in the January 20 , 2020 issue of TIME .",

Returning to the speakership after eight years running the House Democratic minority, she established herself as counterweight and constrainer of this divisive President. She outmaneuvered Trump on policy, from the border wall he didn\u2019t get to the budget agreement he signed loaded with goodies that Democrats wanted. She oversaw an unprecedented litigation effort against the Executive Branch, racking up landmark court victories. And she was the tactician behind the investigation that resulted in Trump\u2019s impeachment on Dec. 18.\n\nWhat is most striking about this moment in Pelosi\u2019s career is that at the peak of power, she is not protecting her position but rather using it in aggressive, even risky ways. Impeaching Trump is a gamble for Pelosi. It has intensified Republicans\u2019 fealty to the President, rallying his base and supercharging his campaign fundraising, potentially increasing his re-election chances. The polarizing effort could jeopardize Democrats who hold seats in Trump territory, and thereby endanger Pelosi\u2019s House majority. With impeachment, Pelosi is betting her own place in history.\n\nPelosi has always been a risk-taker, from defying Chinese authorities by protesting at Tiananmen Square in 1991 to pushing Obamacare through the House with nary a vote to spare in 2010. But she is careful to cast impeachment not as a political gambit but as a project to preserve the checks and balances of American democracy. \u201cThat\u2019s my responsibility: to protect the Constitution of the United States,\u201d she says.\n\nThat battle is playing out on multiple fronts. As Congress returned and Trump launched the country into a potential conflict with Iran, Pelosi sought to rein him in. The House planned to vote Jan. 9 on a war powers resolution designed to limit the President\u2019s ability to escalate the conflict. The behind-the-scenes court battle that Pelosi has field-marshaled aims not just to check Trump\u2019s current power grabs, but also to set precedents that will stop future Presidents from doing the same, or worse.\n\nAnd to Trump\u2019s annoyance, Pelosi is declining to transmit the House\u2019s two impeachment articles to the Senate. Instead of allowing Republican Senators to end the impeachment discussion with a quick vote, she is insisting that the upper chamber agree on rules for the trial first. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it has to meet my standards. When we see what [Mitch McConnell] has in mind, we will be prepared to send over\u201d the articles, she tells TIME on Jan. 8, in her first public comments about the standoff. \u201cWe\u2019ve upped the ante on this.\u201d\n\nPelosi has told colleagues she\u2019s had to wear a night guard because the White House makes her grind her teeth in her sleep. But her frustration is born of determination, not unease. In our interview, I asked her if the President\u2019s nickname for her, Nervous Nancy, is accurate. \u201cPfft,\u201d she says, waving a hand. \u201cHe\u2019s nervous. Everything he says, he\u2019s always projecting. He knows the case that can be made against him. That\u2019s why he\u2019s falling apart.\u201d\n\nGet our Politics Newsletter.

After Pelosi orchestrated Democrats\u2019 2018 midterm wins, an insurgent faction of the caucus moved to replace her with a younger, \u201cless polarizing\u201d figure. Pelosi squashed the uprising with characteristic discipline. Over the ensuing year, instead of holding grudges, she set to holding her diverse caucus together when ideology and identity threatened to splinter it.\n\nFor months, the Democrats\u2019 biggest division was over impeachment. As colleagues and activists agitated for it, Pelosi spent most of the year resisting on the grounds that it could tear the country apart\u2013and hurt her party. All the while, however, she was laying the groundwork behind the scenes to build a case if necessary. \u201cIt seemed like all of a sudden we were unified around an impeachment inquiry,\u201d says Representative Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, the vice chair of the Democratic caucus. \u201cBut that was Nancy Pelosi using individual members and where they were to bring this to a\u2013she always uses this word\u2013a crescendo. So what appears to all of a sudden be a big moment is actually based on months of work.\u201d\n\nFrom start to finish, Pelosi has kept a tighter rein on the proceedings than the public realized, from major strategic decisions to minor stagecraft. It was Pelosi who decreed that the Intelligence Committee would take the lead in the inquiry, even though impeachment is generally considered to be the Judiciary Committee\u2019s purview. (Past Judiciary hearings had devolved into a circus\u2013particularly a Sept. 17 session in which the President\u2019s former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, openly mocked the proceedings.) It was Pelosi who decided that the Democrats\u2019 hashtag for impeachment, #TruthExposed, seemed too harsh; they settled on #DefendOurDemocracy instead.\n\nPelosi refereed contentious disputes between chairmen with discretion. She signed off on every committee report and press release; aides say she caught typos in the Intelligence Committee\u2019s final report before it went out. She decreed that the articles of impeachment would be limited to Trump\u2019s actions in Ukraine rather than incorporating matters related to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, as some of her members wanted. When Judiciary Committee lawyers debated whether to spend half a day of hearings on a presentation related to Mueller\u2019s obstruction-of-justice probe, they appealed the question to the Speaker, noting that the staff was split. \u201cTell them I\u2019m not split,\u201d she replied, rejecting the idea. And while she allowed the committee\u2019s final report to contain references to Mueller\u2019s investigation, she demanded they be deleted from the accompanying announcement.\n\nNo aspect of the spectacle was too small to escape Pelosi\u2019s control. When the Intelligence Committee held its public impeachment hearings in November, Pelosi noticed that chairman Adam Schiff\u2019s head reached nearly to the top of his high-backed chair. After Intelligence finished its work, Judiciary, chaired by Representative Jerry Nadler, was slated to hold hearings in the same room. Pelosi thought if he sat in the same chair, Nadler\u2013a head shorter than Schiff\u2013would look small.\n\nPelosi sent word down: there would have to be a change of furniture. And when Judiciary convened on Dec. 4, Nadler was seated in a leather-backed chair that reached no higher than his ears.\n\nPelosi meets with Representatives Richard Neal and Adam Schiff and House counsel Doug Letter in her office on December 5. Philip Montgomery for TIME\n\nImpeachment was the culmination of Pelosi\u2019s broader effort to hold Trump in check. For the past year, she has overseen investigations by six different congressional committees digging into everything from Trump\u2019s tax returns and allegations of Administration corruption to foreign emoluments and the Russian entanglements Mueller helped uncover. Congressional committees tend to be territorial, but Pelosi convened the six committees\u2019 chairmen weekly, and sometimes more often, to ensure they didn\u2019t duplicate efforts or step on one another\u2019s toes.\n\nShe has also guided a far-reaching effort to rein in Trump through the courts. She hired a 40-year Justice Department veteran, Douglas Letter, to head the House general counsel\u2019s office, a secretive team of nine lawyers, and confers with him on every legal filing, every subpoena. Together they have chosen cases designed to set precedents that affirm Congress\u2019 powers and shore up the institution. \u201cShe\u2019s calling the shots,\u201d Letter tells TIME, in a rare interview. Starting with his job interview, Letter says, Pelosi correctly predicted that \u201cwe would get stonewalled\u201d by Trump and his lawyers, and would have to litigate in the courts more than usual. \u201cShe insisted we would try to pick, particularly for subpoena enforcement, really good cases.\u201d\n\nCourts tend to view litigation between the Legislative and Executive branches with unease. Judges are leery of refereeing what they view as essentially political disputes. But Pelosi and Letter\u2019s approach has produced a string of victories. Courts have ruled in favor of releasing Trump\u2019s tax returns and other financial records, compelled the release of grand-jury materials from the Mueller investigation and dismissed the Administration\u2019s arguments for blocking witnesses. In a blistering November opinion, U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson ruled that Donald McGahn, Trump\u2019s former White House counsel, must testify, and that the Administration\u2019s argument to the contrary \u201csimply has no basis in the law.\u201d She added, \u201cThe primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that Presidents are not kings.\u201d\n\nAs those court cases got tied up in appeals, though, progress in the courts did little to satisfy those eager to use the ultimate tool of presidential accountability. Pelosi resisted impeachment throughout the summer, even as more and more members of her caucus endorsed it. \u201cMany of them were out there for impeachment like a year ago, right after we won,\u201d she says, but she insisted on moving deliberately in order to make the strongest possible case. \u201cI said we\u2019ll go down this path when we\u2019re ready,\u201d Pelosi says. She told her colleagues that they had to wait for the investigation and litigation to play out.\n\nThe frustration built outside of Congress too. In her San Francisco district in August, Pelosi appeared at a banquet in her honor\u2013the \u201cHeart of the Resistance\u201d dinner. She had barely begun to speak when a group of young activists rose in the back, standing on chairs and unfurling black fabric banners with white lettering. time to IMPEACH, they said. WE CAN\u2019T WAIT. A young woman shouted, \u201cPeople are being killed by white supremacists!\u201d A man said, \u201cWe are your constituents!\u201d As the crowd chanted, \u201cLet her speak,\u201d a burly labor organizer got in the activists\u2019 faces, and for a moment it seemed as if they might come to blows before hotel security escorted the protesters out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s O.K.,\u201d Pelosi said from her position at the front of the room. \u201cI\u2019m going to speak. I\u2019m the Speaker of the House!\u201d When she did speak, however, the word impeachment did not escape her lips.\n\nPelosi's desk in her office at the Capitol on December 5. Philip Montgomery for TIME\n\nA few weeks later, the Ukraine scandal changed the short-term politics and the long-term stakes. In mid-September, media outlets started to report that Trump had tried to bully his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, into publicly announcing an investigation of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, using White House access and congressionally approved foreign aid as leverage. His actions had alarmed government officials, leading an intelligence-community whistle-blower to file a secret complaint.\n\nTrump had applied the pressure during a phone call in July, the day after Mueller testified before Congress. To House Democrats, it seemed Trump was setting a dangerous precedent of presidential impunity, soliciting foreign assistance in the 2020 election just as he\u2019d been accused of doing in 2016. \u201cI was one of those who were very reluctant to proceed\u201d with impeachment, says Representative Ed Perlmutter, a Democrat from Colorado who is close to Pelosi despite trying to block her from the speakership after the 2018 midterms. \u201cBut putting people\u2019s lives at risk by holding up that aid money, extorting the Ukrainian President to do the political bidding of the President\u2013that was something that changed the calculation for everybody.\u201d\n\nPelosi had already begun preparations toward impeachment when, at 5 p.m. on Monday, Sept. 23, she took a call from a group of seven freshman Democrats. All of them had military and intelligence backgrounds; all had flipped Republican districts; all had opposed impeachment to this point. Now they told her they were jointly writing an op-ed, to appear that evening on the Washington Post\u2019s website, endorsing an impeachment inquiry. \u201cWe have devoted our lives to the service and security of our country,\u201d the op-ed read. \u201cThese allegations are stunning, both in the national security threat they pose and the potential corruption they represent.\u201d\n\nFlying back to Washington from New York City that night, Pelosi began drafting an announcement in her looping cursive hand on a piece of loose-leaf paper. The next morning, the Speaker was in her airy Georgetown penthouse condo when she received an unscheduled call from the President. It was 8:16 a.m. Trump was in New York, preparing for a speech to the U.N. The subject of the call was ostensibly gun control, a topic dear to Pelosi\u2019s heart. But that turned out to be a pretext.\n\nTrump quickly turned to the subject of the July 25 Zelensky conversation. There was \u201cno pressure at all,\u201d he insisted, according to a source familiar with the conversation between Pelosi and the President. The call was \u201c100% perfect. I didn\u2019t ask him for anything.\u201d Trump added, \u201cLiterally, you would be impressed by my lack of pressure.\u201d\n\nPelosi was unconvinced. \u201cMr. President,\u201d she said, \u201cwe have a problem here.\u201d She repeatedly urged the President to release the still hidden whistle-blower complaint that had set off the controversy. And she reminded him that as the longest-serving member of the House Intelligence Committee, this allegation was \u201cin my wheelhouse.\u201d As the conversation grew tense, she urged him one more time to release the complaint. \u201cI have to go give a speech,\u201d Trump said, and hung up.\n\nTo Pelosi, Trump\u2019s belief that the Zelensky call was \u201cperfect\u201d showed an inability to distinguish right from wrong. For months, she had believed voters in the 2020 election should be the ones to remove Trump from office. Now she was increasingly convinced it would be dangerous to allow him to continue his term without rebuke.\n\nAt 4 p.m. that afternoon, she met with her caucus and outlined her plan to announce an impeachment inquiry. There were no objections. As her 5 p.m. announcement drew near, an aide tugged at her sleeve, urging her to go upstairs and run through the speech just once before she went out and delivered it. Finally she turned on him, snapping, \u201cI walk into rooms and read teleprompters all the time. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll do.\u201d\n\nThen it was time to face the cameras for history. \u201cThe actions taken to date by the President have seriously violated the Constitution,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThe President must be held accountable. No one is above the law.\u201d\n\nIn a televised address given at the Capitol on the morning of December 5, Pelosi announces that the House of Representatives will begin drafting articles of impeachment. Philip Montgomery for TIME\n\nNow that the House has impeached Trump in a nearly party-line vote, it\u2019s fair to ask how much Pelosi\u2019s careful management of the process achieved. The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, has declared he will work to ensure Trump is acquitted. McConnell\u2019s Democratic counterpart, Chuck Schumer, seems to agree that Trump\u2019s acquittal is a foregone conclusion. \u201cI don\u2019t want to second-guess\u201d the outcome, Schumer tells TIME. \u201cBut these Republicans are not the Republicans of old. They are totally supine in their obeisance to Trump.\u201d Yet Schumer agrees with Pelosi that \u201cwe have no choice, given the President\u2019s lack of respect for democracy and the Constitution.\u201d\n\nRepublicans gloat that impeachment has strengthened Trump politically\u2013that somehow, a process designed by the founders to constrain a President has perversely achieved the opposite. Trump\u2019s re-election campaign has harnessed his supporters\u2019 outrage over impeachment to raise buckets of money. As the drama played out over the final three months of 2019, Trump raked in $46 million, his best quarterly haul of the year and more than any of his Democratic rivals have raised over a similar period. Within 72 hours of Pelosi\u2019s Sept. 24 announcement that Democrats would move forward with an impeachment inquiry, the Trump campaign pulled in $15 million in small-dollar donations.\n\nCritics accuse Pelosi of caving to pressure and violating her own conditions to pursue Trump\u2019s impeachment. Even Republicans who aren\u2019t big Trump fans have \u201cbeen sort of driven toward him by this\u2013they do feel that Democrats overplayed their hand,\u201d says Representative Peter King, a New York Republican. \u201cThis whole thing has been a rush to judgment.\u201d\n\nBut Pelosi\u2019s allies say holding out until the Ukraine scandal broke strengthened her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s made her an even more powerful voice in this moment,\u201d says Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island. \u201cShe resisted this for so long because she really understood the consequences to the country. That gives her tremendous credibility with the American people when she came to the conclusion it was necessary.\u201d\n\nPelosi prepares for a press conference on December 5 as an aide looks on. Philip Montgomery for TIME\n\nIt\u2019s an open question whether Pelosi\u2019s gamble has the public\u2019s support. In polls, a slight plurality of Americans\u2013just over 49%\u2013support Trump\u2019s impeachment, according to averages tabulated by FiveThirtyEight. That number shot up after the scandal began, and is historically high, but it has barely budged since October, and Trump\u2019s approval rating has remained steady in the low 40s as well. Democratic pollster Geoff Garin says that despite GOP claims to the contrary, \u201cthere\u2019s no evidence that impeachment has changed the fundamental dynamics of the 2020 election.\u201d Trump\u2019s opponents, he contends, are even more galvanized by impeachment than his supporters are. And by November 2020, Garin says, the data suggest that voters will base their decisions far more on issues like health care than on impeachment.\n\nIn mid-December, I sat down with Pelosi again and asked her to respond to some of the criticism of the process. The Speaker was battling a lingering winter cold, and was in the midst of last-minute negotiations with the White House and Senate on a $1.4 trillion spending deal to avert a shutdown while sharply cutting back Trump\u2019s requested border funding.\n\nThe idea of a rush to impeachment exasperates the Speaker, who points out that the White House limited the evidence available with its unprecedented stonewalling. And Pelosi contends that the process is merely an extension of the prior investigations of Trump. \u201cThis has been going on for 2\u00bd years, since the Justice Department tasked Director Mueller to go into the investigation,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been going on for a long time. The aha moment was Ukraine. But the pattern of behavior was very self-evident over time.\u201d\n\nMany Democrats hoped some Republicans might support impeachment; Pelosi claims nothing ever surprises her. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to see that they are ignoring their own oath of office,\u201d she says. \u201cThe President must be held accountable. And the fact that the Republicans are even in denial of the factual basis of what happened is sad for our country.\u201d\n\nOn Dec. 17, the night before the full House would debate and vote on Trump\u2019s impeachment, Pelosi met behind closed doors with top caucus members on the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee. She hinted, for the first time, that she was contemplating a curveball: declining to immediately transmit the impeachment articles to the Senate after the House passed them. \u201cThe rule empowers the Speaker to be able to decide how to send the articles and when to send the articles over to the Senate,\u201d she said, according to an aide who was in the room. \u201cMy view is we don\u2019t know enough about what they are going to do. We want to see what [is] their level of fairness and openness and the rest.\u201d\n\nPelosi, according to an aide, had been mulling the tactic since she heard former Nixon White House counsel John Dean float the idea on CNN on Dec. 5. In the committee meeting, she added that she believed McConnell would be motivated to move. \u201cSomebody said to me today that he may not even take up what we send. [But] then [Trump] will never be vindicated,\u201d she said, according to the aide in the room. \u201cHe will be impeached forever. Forever. No matter what the Senate does.\u201d\n\nThe following day, Pelosi presided over the floor vote on impeachment, wearing a striking black suit to project solemnity, accessorized with a large gold brooch of the Mace of the Republic, a symbol of the House. When scattered cheers broke out inside the chamber after the first article was approved, she sternly and silently shushed them with a glare and a sharp gesture. After the vote, she announced that she did not plan to transmit the articles right away, saying she could not determine how to appoint House impeachment managers until the Senate decides on its rules for the trial.\n\nMcConnell has mocked the idea that Pelosi or Schumer can shape the Senate trial to their liking. But he\u2019s also said he won\u2019t start it until Pelosi sends the articles, and it\u2019s clear from Trump\u2019s tweets and statements that the unresolved situation bothers him. Moreover, the delay is allowing facts to emerge. Over the two-week holiday break, newly unredacted emails showed Pentagon officials worrying about the legality of Trump\u2019s effort to withhold military aid from Ukraine. And on Jan. 6, former National Security Adviser John Bolton, potentially a key witness to Trump\u2019s alleged actions toward Ukraine, announced he would testify before the Senate if subpoenaed. On Jan. 7, McConnell announced that he had enough Republican votes to begin the trial, and Democrats in both chambers appeared to be getting restless\u2013but still Pelosi refused to budge.\n\nThe gambit is reminiscent of another Pelosi maneuver designed to exploit Trump\u2019s insecurities. Pelosi retook the speakership a year ago amid a government shutdown triggered by Trump\u2019s demand for border-wall funding. She refused to negotiate on the matter until the government reopened. As the stalemate dragged on, Pelosi seized on an unexpected source of leverage: she postponed Trump\u2019s State of the Union address to Congress, knowing that he prized it as a televised set piece showcasing his power.\n\nThen she stubbornly waited out her adversary. \u201cThe President tried to break us in January [2019] by throwing us into a government shutdown at the same time we were transitioning into the majority,\u201d says Hakeem Jeffries, a Democratic Congressman from New York who serves as caucus chairman. \u201cWe held together, and instead of breaking us, we broke him. It ended in unconditional surrender.\u201d\n\nPelosi meets with her staff on Capitol Hill on December 5. Philip Montgomery for TIME\n\nThis power struggle between the branches of government was not Pelosi\u2019s vision. She preferred the emphasis to be on the Democrats\u2019 policy agenda. She believed that kitchen-table concerns were more important to voters and wanted to show that Democrats are capable of governing. Despite Trump\u2019s criticism of the \u201cdo-nothing Democrats,\u201d the House has passed nearly 400 bills, most with GOP support. If there\u2019s a single morning that captures how Pelosi has juggled the priorities of policymaking and oversight, it is Dec. 10, when she led the 9 a.m. announcement of the impeachment articles, then proceeded directly to a 10 a.m. press conference to announce that the House had made a deal to pass the President\u2019s revision of the North American Free Trade Agreement.\n\nHer approach is a stark departure from how the GOP handled Barack Obama\u2019s presidency\u2013opposing Obama at every turn, determined not to give him victories even on uncontroversial matters. Pelosi and Schumer have found ways to work with Trump, particularly on trade, prescription drugs and infrastructure, an approach that rankles the left. \u201cDemocrats should not be giving Donald Trump wins that normalize his presidency and give him a set of accomplishments to campaign on,\u201d says Brian Fallon of the liberal group Demand Justice. \u201cHe benefits vastly more from a bipartisan trade deal than they do.\u201d In a stroke of irony, the Speaker whose moderate colleagues tried to get rid of her for fear she struck heartland voters as too far left is now hailed\u2013or derided\u2013as a moderating force.\n\nYet House Democrats from all wings of the diverse caucus say they are more unified than at any time in recent memory. \u201cI think we\u2019re doing the very best we could,\u201d says Representative Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, one of the authors of the national-security freshmen\u2019s op-ed. Liberal Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, agreed: \u201cIt\u2019s been a very disciplined approach.\u201d\n\nThat comity will be tested as Washington heads into an election year. More is at stake than the balance between the parties. The institutions of American democracy are being tested. The checks and balances designed by the founders depend on the coequal branches\u2019 ability to stand up to one another. \u201cShe\u2019s had a herculean task, and she\u2019s done it brilliantly,\u201d says Jonathan Rose, a former Nixon and Reagan Administration lawyer affiliated with the anti-Trump conservative legal group Checks and Balances. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d be for Nancy Pelosi in my lifetime.\u201d\n\nPelosi, for her part, won\u2019t admit to any preference for her party\u2019s 2020 nominee. But the Speaker, as usual, has a strategy for how she believes the Democrats should proceed. \u201cThe message has to be one that is not menacing,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat works in Michigan works in San Francisco, about job creation and the rest. But what works in San Francisco may not work in Michigan. Michigan is where we must win, and we must win in the Electoral College. We won the House last year by having mobilization at the grassroots level. We have to do that again.\u201d The question for Democrats now may have less to do with the effects of Pelosi\u2019s actions than whether they heed her advice.\n\nWith reporting by Alana Abramson and Brian Bennett/Washington\n\nThis appears in the January 20, 2020 issue of TIME.\n\nWrite to Molly Ball at molly.ball@time.com.",
