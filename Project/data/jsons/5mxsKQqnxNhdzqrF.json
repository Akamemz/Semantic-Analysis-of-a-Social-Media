    "content": "After more than 21 hours on the Senate floor , Sen. Ted Cruz wrapped up his marathon speech against ObamaCare at noon on Wednesday -- though , as expected , it did not stop the chamber from proceeding to a controversial test vote .\nThe speech amounted to a final act of political theater before the vote . As he concluded , Cruz said to the American people : `` This debate 's in your hands . '' He told reporters afterward that the debate is n't about the bill itself but about `` whether Washington was going to listen to the American people . ''\nCruz had attracted a rotating set of supporters by sunrise , as they joined him on the floor in blasting the health care law .\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid was less amused , taking the floor to describe Cruz 's address as a `` big waste of time , '' with a government shutdown looming unless lawmakers can resolve their dispute over the health care law .\n`` With all due respect , I 'm not sure we learned anything new , '' Reid said .\nThe Senate is about to hold a test vote on a bill that would both fund the government past Sept. 30 and defund the health care law , though Reid is expected to quickly strip the ObamaCare language .\nCruz , R-Texas , had declared Tuesday afternoon that he intended to speak in opposition to ObamaCare `` until I am no longer able to stand . ''\n`` ObamaCare is n't working , '' he said . `` There are politicians in this body who are not listening to the people . ''\nThe feisty senator spoke through the night . His topics ranged from the American revolution and the Washington establishment to his Cuban-born father and the impact of the health care law .\nAs his speech neared its sixth hour , Cruz took an odd turn by reading his young daughters a bedtime story via the Senate floor cameras . Cruz said his book of choice , Dr. Seuss ' `` Green Eggs and Ham , '' was a favorite of his as a child .\nThe speech was reminiscent of Sen. Rand Paul , R-Ky. , earlier this year staging an old-fashioned filibuster to voice his concerns over drones .\nPaul joined Cruz on the Senate floor for a time , telling his colleague to make sure he is wearing comfortable shoes for the long night ahead and saying `` we 're asking for a dialogue '' on ObamaCare .\n`` How do we get the dialogue unless somebody 's willing to stand up and say enough 's enough ? '' Paul asked .\nCruz , with the help of Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and others , surpassed the length of Paul 's nearly 13-hour filibuster at about 3:30 a.m. EDT Wednesday .\nCruz 's address on the Senate floor was not technically a filibuster like Paul 's because he is not technically able to stop the Senate from holding a test vote on Wednesday . Democrats say that vote is happening no matter what .\nCruz has taken a curious position on that vote . Though he supported a House-passed bill that both funds the government past Sept. 30 and de-funds ObamaCare , he has urged his colleagues to block the bill in the Senate -- out of concern that Reid will add an amendment stripping out the ObamaCare provision .\nSince Monday , however , Cruz has lost the support of many of his Republican colleagues . GOP leaders want to defund the law , but do n't think stalling the bill in the Senate is the best way forward . For some , the position Cruz wants lawmakers to take is counterintuitive .\n`` We 'd all be hard-pressed to explain why we were opposed to a bill we were in favor of . And invoking cloture that defunds ObamaCare , does n't raise taxes , and respects the Budget Control Act strikes me as a no-brainer , '' Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday .\nSome Republicans also are openly dubious that the push to defund ObamaCare has any chance of succeeding -- and worry that Republicans will take the blame if lawmakers are deadlocked and the government shuts down on Oct. 1 .\nSen. Orrin Hatch , R-Utah , said Republicans surely would be blamed for a shutdown , in part because of media bias against his party .\nSen. John McCain , R-Ariz. , said the effort is hopeless . `` It will be a cold day in Arizona when we defund ObamaCare , '' he said . `` I know how this movie ends . I do n't know all the scenes before it ends , but I know how it ends . We do n't defund ObamaCare . ''\nSome GOP leaders , though , are still urging moderate Democrats to join them in voting against the health care law . Their hope is to advance the bill in a test vote on Wednesday , then convince enough senators to block any effort to fund the law . That 's an uphill climb .\nAnd Reid said Democrats are n't budging . `` The Senate will not pass any bill that defunds or delays ObamaCare , '' he said .\nDespite the divide in the GOP , though , there 's no guarantee that lawmakers can reach common ground and pass a budget bill by the time funding runs out on Oct. 1 .\nIf Reid musters the votes to strip the ObamaCare language , he 'd likely have to clear one more 60-vote hurdle before passing the bill and sending it back to the House . If the House , then , tries to change the Senate bill , lawmakers could easily miss the end-of-the-month deadline .\nReid claimed Tuesday that any effort by the House to modify the bill would be a `` surefire way '' to shut down the government .\nTo make the pill a bit easier to swallow , Reid said he was changing the budget bill so it only lasts through Nov. 15 , as opposed to Dec. 15 .
