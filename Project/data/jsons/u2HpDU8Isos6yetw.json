Despite this history , and in important ways because of it , I will not vote for Donald Trump if he wins the Republican nomination . I should add that neither could I vote in good conscience for Hillary Clinton or any of the other Democrats running for president , since they oppose many of the things I have stood for in my career as a conservative -- and , in the case of Mrs. Clinton , because I consider her an ethical wreck .

Deace also labeled Trump \u201c an unrepentant serial liar and adulterer. \u201d He wrote of his November vote :\nConservativism is supposed to be about conserving the things that created American Exceptionalism -- not defining them down to play a part in a cult of personality . Neither is it supposed to be about race-baiting , ethnic tribalism , authoritarianism , support for Planned Parenthood or progressivism . That 's the left , but that 's also Trump , who 's just repackaging our opponent 's views in pro-American terms .

Bush knowingly misled the world about Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction . \u201c I will tell you . They lied . And they said there were weapons of mass destruction and there were none .

Buckley rise from the grave and beg me to support him \u201d and concluded :\nI have opposed Trump from the first day of his wretched , crapulous campaign .

Bill Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, which is best known for its advocacy of a hyper-interventionist foreign policy, told me that there was no chance he would ever back Trump. \u201cI've been Sherman-esque--and more!,\u201d he said in an e-mail, \u201csince I've said I would try to recruit a real conservative to run as a fourth (Bloomberg being the 3rd) party candidate.\u201d He added (without irony, I think) that \u201cDick Cheney-Tom Cotton would be the ideal ticket, but am working on others that approach that high level.\u201d [The New Yorker, 2/26/16]\n\nKristol also told The Daily Caller: \u201cCouldn't vote for Trump, couldn't vote for Hillary.\u201d [The Daily Caller, 12/1/15]\n\nCNN's Kevin Madden: \u201cI'm Prepared To Write Somebody In So That I Have A Clear Conscience.\u201d The Washington Post quoted Madden, a former Romney adviser who works as a CNN commentator, stating of Trump:\n\n\u201cFor many Republicans, Trump is more than just a political choice,\u201d said Kevin Madden, a veteran operative who advised 2012 nominee Mitt Romney. \u201cIt's a litmus test for character.\u201d Madden, like some of his peers, said he could never vote for Trump. If he is the nominee, Madden said, \u201cI'm prepared to write somebody in so that I have a clear conscience.\u201d [The Washington Post, 2/28/16]\n\nNew York Times' Peter Wehner: \u201cI Will Not Vote For Donald Trump If He Wins The Republican Nomination.\u201d Wehner, a Times contributing opinion writer who served in three Republican administrations, pledged to not support Trump or Clinton in November:\n\nBeginning with Ronald Reagan, I have voted Republican in every presidential election since I first became eligible to vote in 1980. I worked in the Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations and in the White House for George W. Bush as a speechwriter and adviser. I have also worked for Republican presidential campaigns, although not this time around. Despite this history, and in important ways because of it, I will not vote for Donald Trump if he wins the Republican nomination. I should add that neither could I vote in good conscience for Hillary Clinton or any of the other Democrats running for president, since they oppose many of the things I have stood for in my career as a conservative -- and, in the case of Mrs. Clinton, because I consider her an ethical wreck. If Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were the Republican and Democratic nominees, I would prefer to vote for a responsible third-party alternative; absent that option, I would simply not cast a ballot for president. A lot of Republicans, I suspect, would do the same. [The New York Times, 1/14/16]\n\nWashington Post's Robert Kagan: \u201cThe Only Choice Will Be To Vote For Hillary Clinton.\u201d Kagan, a Reagan administration official and Iraq War cheerleader, wrote in a Post column: \u201cThe Republicans' creation will soon be let loose on the land, leaving to others the job the party failed to carry out. For this former Republican, and perhaps for others, the only choice will be to vote for Hillary Clinton. The party cannot be saved, but the country still can be.\u201d [The Washington Post, 2/25/16]\n\nWashington Examiner's Philip Klein: \u201c11 Reasons This Conservative Would Never, Ever, Ever Vote For Trump.\u201d Klein, the Washington Examiner's managing editor, offered 11 reasons he wouldn't support Trump in the general election, including, \u201cHe's a megalomaniac who doesn't understand constitutional limits on executive power.\u201d And, \u201cI don't want Republicanism that's served with an entree of racism and sexism.\u201d [Washington Examiner, 2/24/16]\n\nIowa Radio Host Steve Deace: \u201cI Will Not Lend My Name And An Ounce Of Integrity To This Reality Television Star's Charade.\u201d Deace, a Cruz campaign surrogate, cited a litany of reasons he wouldn't support Trump in the general election, including Trump's refusal to disavow racists. Deace also labeled Trump \u201can unrepentant serial liar and adulterer.\u201d He wrote of his November vote:\n\nConservativism is supposed to be about conserving the things that created American Exceptionalism--not defining them down to play a part in a cult of personality. Neither is it supposed to be about race-baiting, ethnic tribalism, authoritarianism, support for Planned Parenthood or progressivism. That's the left, but that's also Trump, who's just repackaging our opponent's views in pro-American terms. Therefore, should Trump be the nominee I will not lend my name and an ounce of integrity to this reality television star's charade. Now, should you feel compelled to vote for him because he's not Hillary, I want you to know I won't condemn you, either, provided you're not being intellectually dishonest in the process. [Conservative Review, 2/29/16]\n\nThe Federalist's Tom Nichols: \u201cI'll Take Hillary Clinton Over Donald Trump.\u201d Nichols, a professor at the U.S. Naval War College and at the Harvard Extension School, wrote on the conservative website The Federalist: \u201cIf forced into a choice between Clinton and Trump, I will prefer Hillary Clinton. The future of the entire conservative movement is at stake, and a Clinton victory over Trump might be the only hope of saving it.\u201d He added: \u201cIn the end, a Trump administration will not only avert the first chance at unified Republican government in years, but will finish off the conservative movement itself.\u201d [The Federalist, 2/24/16]\n\nThe Federalist's Bethany S. Mandel Would Prefer \u201cEven Hillary Clinton To Trump.\u201d The Daily Beast reported that Mandel would support Clinton over Trump:\n\nConservative essayist Bethany S. Mandel, who has been awash in a deluge of social media abuse since she began denouncing Donald Trump, finally purchased a handgun over the weekend. [...] Yet one can hardly fault Mandel's feelings of vulnerability. Typical online insults (screenshots of which she provided to The Daily Beast) included \u201cyou deserve the oven,\u201d complete with the image of a Domino's Pizza oven--this from an apparent Trump fan who goes by the Twitter handle @dinguscout. After Mandel observed: \u201cAnother night blocking all the anti-Semites who are helping Trump make American[sic] great again,\u201d a second apparent Trump supporter, @unusr1, tweeted at her: \u201cMissed one, you slimy Jewess.\u201d [...] Thus Mandel--who prefers Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio or, as a desperate last resort, even Hillary Clinton to Trump--recently engaged in an online skirmish with Breitbart's Washington political editor, Matthew Boyle. [The Daily Beast, 3/1/16]\n\nConservative Writer Doug Heye Won't Support Trump \u201cBecause Of Trump's Perversion Of Conservatism, Along With The Devastating Impact He Would Have.\u201d Heye, a former communications director for the Republican National Committee who frequently writes on politics, explained why he \u201ccannot support Donald Trump were he to win the Republican nomination\u201d (emphasis in original):\n\nBecause of Trump's perversion of conservatism, along with the devastating impact he would have if nominated, I cannot support Donald Trump were he to win the Republican nomination. As the GOP battles over what - or who - defines conservatism, it should be easy to define what doesn't: angry populism, cheap sloganeering and bombast. [...] As a loyal and proud conservative Republican, I cannot help make that happen by voting for a Trump-led ticket in 2016. [Independent Journal Review, January 2016]\n\nRicochet's Claire Berlinski: \u201cI'd Vote for Hillary Before Trump.\u201d Berlinski, a conservative writer and a Manhattan Institute scholar, wrote a post explaining \u201cWhy I'd Vote for Hillary Before Trump.\u201d She cited Trump's views on the Bush administration's handling of Iraq (emphasis in original):\n\nThe moment that most clearly demonstrates that he's nuts -- and nuts in a way different in kind from any previous president in the nuclear era and from any of the other candidates for the presidency -- was when he said George W. Bush knowingly misled the world about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. \u201cI will tell you. They lied. And they said there were weapons of mass destruction and there were none. And they knew there were none. There were no weapons of mass destruction.\u201d [...] I have many other objections to him, but I think this one is -- as George Tenet might say -- a slam dunk.* You can't put people who believe things like that in the White House. It's too dangerous. [Ricochet, 2/25/16]\n\nWashington Examiner's David Freddoso: \u201cI've Made Clear I'll Be Looking For A Third Party Candidate.\u201d Freddoso, an Examiner contributing editor, has repeatedly tweeted the anti-Trump hashtag #NeverTrump, writing that \u201cI've made clear I'll be looking for a third party candidate,\u201d and \u201cI wouldn't ever support someone like him and he'll lose anyway so why defile myself by considering him.\u201d [Twitter.com, 2/27/16, 2/27/16]\n\nCNN's Tara Setmayer: \u201cI Will Never Vote For Him. EVER.\u201d Setmayer, a CNN political commentator who worked for Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA), has tweeted that she is \u201cnot deceived by Trump's manipulation. I will never vote for him. EVER. I'm a real conservative.\u201d She's also made clear she will not vote for Trump even if he's the Republican nominee. [Twitter.com, 2/29/16, 3/1/16]\n\nGOP Strategist And Writer Rick Wilson: \u201cWith God As My Witness, I Will Never Vote For Donald Trump.\u201d Wilson, a Republican consultant and conservative writer, wrote: \u201cI will never vote for Donald Trump, not even if Ronald Reagan and William F. Buckley rise from the grave and beg me to support him\u201d and concluded:\n\nI have opposed Trump from the first day of his wretched, crapulous campaign. I have opposed Trump when his clownish minions called my clients seeking to have me fired. I have opposed The Donald when his slavish of Trumpbart stooges ran story after story attacking me, and unleashed their fever-swamp yokels on my email, my phone, and my family. I will continue to oppose Trump, implacably and unceasingly. I will not bend. I will not cease this fight. I will never embrace this thuggish, venal, gibbering psychotic, and I will not countenance those who do. I don't care if I'm the last Republican in America standing to resist this man, but with almighty God as my witness, I will not vote for Donald Trump. [Independent Journal Review, February 2016]\n\nGOP Strategist And Writer Liz Mair: \u201cI Will Either Vote Third Party Or Do A Write-In, Potentially Of Myself.\u201d Mair, a Republican strategist and blogger, told The New Yorker in an email: \u201cI have repeatedly stated that if he is the GOP nominee, I will either vote third party or do a write-in, potentially of myself. At least if I do the latter thing, I know I'm voting for someone I 100% agree with for once :).\u201d [The New Yorker, 2/26/16]\n\nConservative Writer Eliot A. Cohen Would Vote For Clinton Over Trump. Cohen, a Johns Hopkins University professor and former Bush administration official, wrote on Twitter, \u201cI will oppose Trump as nominee. ... Short list: demagoguery, torture, bigotry, misogyny, isolationism, violence. Not the Party of Lincoln & not me.\u201d He added that he has would support Clinton over Trump.
