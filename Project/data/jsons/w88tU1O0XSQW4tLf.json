    "content": "Maybe you 've noticed from watching TV in the past couple of years : When it 's about tax returns , executive orders or , of course , Russia , the left strikes a law-and-order pose . Nobody , they tell us , should be above the law in this country . Nobody . Not even -- drumroll , please -- the president of the United States .\nIt is one of their favorite talking points , and it 's highly effective because it 's absolutely true . In America , nobody is above the law . That is the promise of this country , and it is the best thing about us . That 's why we are n't third-world . If only Democrats actually believed their own bumper stickers . Nobody is above the law ? Please , spare us . The Democratic Party 's entire electoral future depends upon making certain that millions of people are above the law .\nIn real life , our laws are unambiguous . Nobody is allowed to move to this country without our permission . People who come here illegally must be sent home . That is what the law says . The Democratic Party is built around ignoring and subverting that law . Just this month , the president called for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to deport illegal aliens facing final deportation orders . To be clear , these are not people pulled at random out of restaurant kitchens but people who , at our expense , have gotten their day in court . They have gone through the process , but in the end , they 've lost and been ordered to leave . They have chosen to ignore that order . So , if you cared about the rule of law , you would send these people home immediately . But the left does n't care , so it denounces any attempt to enforce the law as bigotry .\nHillary Clinton actually shared a guide to help these people , the foreign nationals , evade American law enforcement . It is insanity . But it is normal now . It is now mainstream within the Democratic Party to compare border facilities -- our border facilities -- to Nazi concentration camps . We are a country that liberated concentration camps . Virtually every Democratic-run city has declared itself a sanctuary for illegal aliens . The state of California banned private businesses from giving assistance to federal immigration enforcement . Meanwhile , the Obama administration , you may remember , created an entire program -- called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , or DACA -- specifically to protect millions of illegal immigrants from having the law enforced against them . So , maybe you support DACA . Many Americans do . But do n't lecture us about how nobody is above the law . `` Dreamers , '' the beneficiaries of DACA , are above the law by definition . That is the point of the program . There does n't seem to be a single Democratic candidate in the race right now who believes in enforcing immigration law .\nMany Democratic presidential candidates even argue we should award illegal immigrants with taxpayer-funded benefits . Come here without being asked , break our laws , take our benefits , denounce us as `` racist '' if you want , and we will still give you free health care . The message is not going unnoticed in the world 's poorest countries . Since May 30 , more than 1,100 African migrants from 19 different countries have been caught trying to cross our borders . These are not people fleeing starvation . Obviously , they had to buy transatlantic plane tickets to get to our continent . They are coming because they know they will be paid more in America . That 's not irrational . You should n't hate them for it .\nThink about what this means . There are billions of similar people all around the world . Check the global population number if you do n't believe it . The Democratic Party decided all of them deserve to come here and stay permanently , at our expense . The law does not apply to them . This is totally nuts , and it is scary . Even some on the left think it is . A new report by the Center for American Progress , the preeminent liberal think tank in Washington , warns that its party 's immigration position could cost Democrats the next election . The report says the position is so extreme that American voters are being forced to choose between being a nation of immigrants or a nation of laws .\nIn the end , most people are for laws . In a newly released Marist poll , only 27 % of American adults supported decriminalizing illegal border crossings . That is a position many candidates on the Democratic side have taken recently .
