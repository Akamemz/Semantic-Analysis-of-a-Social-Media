Stocks got a major boost Thursday from a slew of strong earnings reports from companies ranging from heavy equipment maker Caterpillar (CAT) to automaker General Motors (GM).\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average came close to having its best day of 2014, but news about a New York City doctor being rushed to a hospital on Ebola fears trimmed a 300-point gain to 216.58 points for the day. The blue-chip benchmark ended up 1.3% to close at 16,677.90.\n\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 23.71 points, 1.2%, to close at 1950.82, while the tech-laden Nasdaq composite ended up 69.95 points, 1.6%, to finish at 4452.79.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury note yield rose to 2.28% from 2.22% as investors jumped out of bonds and back into stocks.\n\nThe news flash that a health care worker, who has returned recently from one of the three countries in West Africa where the Ebola epidemic is rampant, was being tested Thursday for the virus at a New York city hospital, was cited as a reason why the Dow's gains were trimmed by about 85 points late in the trading session.\n\n\"I gather (the news) didn't help,\" says Gary Kaltbaum, president of Kaltbaum Capital Management.\n\nToday's rally on Wall Street is part of a larger recovery story for the stock market that began late last week when intense selling pressure suddenly reversed course amid a drop in so-called \"headline risk,\" says Katrina Lamb, head of investment strategy and research at MV Financial.\n\nLamb points out that the both the S&P 500 and Dow have been able to climb back above their average price levels over the past 200 days after dipping briefly below that closely watched 200-day moving average last week.

A closely followed purchasing managers' index, or PMI, edged up in October in Germany, topping expectations. The PMI came in at 54.3, a tad higher than estimates but investors focused on the manufacturing component, which rose to a three-month high.\n\nEurope benchmarks started the day in the red and closed up. The DAX of Germany powered 1.2% higher. Major Asia indexes all lost, the Nikkei of Japan off 0.4%.",
