In general , what suddenly goes up in polls tends to gradually come back down after a matter of a few weeks . Conventions typically produce polling swings of 4 to 6 percentage points toward the party that just nominated its candidate , for instance \u2014 but the polls usually revert back to about where they were before after a few weeks .\nWe \u2019 ve also repeatedly seen this pattern after various Democrats declared for the race this year . Joe Biden , Bernie Sanders , Kamala Harris and even Beto O \u2019 Rourke all got noticeable bounces when they officially declared for the presidency , only to fall back to their pre-declaration averages later on .\nIt looks as though something like this is happening again following the first Democratic debate last month . If you look at the RealClearPolitics average :\nBiden has rebounded to 28.4 percentage points from a low of 26.0 percentage points just after the debate . He was at 32.1 percent before the debate , so he \u2019 s regained about two-fifths of what he lost .\nHarris has fallen to 12.2 percentage points from a peak of 15.2 percentage points . She was at 7.0 percent before the debate , so she \u2019 s lost about a third of what she \u2019 d gained .\nHarris is still in better shape than she was before the debates , but she \u2019 s currently 16 points behind Biden instead of looking like she \u2019 s on the verge of overtaking him .\nI \u2019 ll be honest \u2026 as predictable as this pattern is , it \u2019 s easy even for professionals like me to get caught up in the moment , especially in the early stages of a race before we \u2019 re using any sort of model to smooth the data out . If a candidate rapidly goes from 7 to 15 in the polls , our unconscious , System 1 reflex is to assume the trend will continue , and that the candidate will continue gaining ground \u2014 to 20 points , 25 points and beyond . More often than not , though , the candidate loses ground after a sharp rise .\nWhy this pattern occurs is somewhat beyond the scope of this short article . But one contributing factor may be nonresponse bias \u2014 after a good debate for Harris and a poor one for Biden , for instance , Harris supporters may be more likely to respond to polls and Biden ones less so . I tend to think this phenomenon is a little overstated and that an easier answer is simply that a lot of voters don \u2019 t have deep convictions about the race until much later , and so bounce around among whichever candidates have gotten favorable press coverage recently .
