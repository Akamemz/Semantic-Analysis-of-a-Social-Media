Many colleges and universities have announced plans to teach many or all of their classes in the fall online to limit the spread of the virus .\nThe swift turnaround by the Department of Homeland Security came during a federal district court hearing about a lawsuit filed by Harvard University and MIT seeking a temporary injunction of the new guidelines . It represents an unusual retreat from an administration that has aggressively sought to curb immigration .\nFacing fierce opposition , the Trump administration on Tuesday dropped its proposal to bar international students from studying in the United States if all of their classes are taught online amid the coronavirus pandemic .\n\u201c This is a significant victory , \u201d Harvard president Lawrence Bacow said in a message to the university community . \u201c The directive had disrupted all of American higher education . ... The ICE directive sought to force each of us to choose between the health of our communities and the education of our international students \u2014 a false and dangerous choice which we rejected . In the end , the public overwhelmingly agreed with us . \u201d\nAngie Jo , 26 , a Canadian citizen who is earning her doctoral degree in political science from MIT , said she and her friends spent last week in fear of being deported , having to suddenly break leases and scrambling to figure out where in the world they could go .\nJo , whose family is in South Korea , has been living in the Cambridge area since she was an undergraduate student .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a huge relief , \u201d Jo said . \u201c I \u2019 ve really put down roots here .
