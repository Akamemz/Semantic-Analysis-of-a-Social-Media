    "content": "As a savvy reader , you already know that technological change is why the jobs in manufacturing are drifting away from Youngstown , Ohio . You know that most of the drift goes to other American cities , such as Houston or Chattanooga . You know that Appalachian jobs in coal mining are not coming back , because new techniques have permanently cheapened natural gas . You know that the Trump administration 's scapegoat , foreign competition , bears little responsibility for any of this . And when foreign encroachment does happen , you know it 's good , not bad , for most Americans .\nStill , many reasonable people fret . Is n't technological unemployment a real and serious problem ? Non-economists of a quantitative bent fret about what we 're going to do when all the jobs go away\u2014when , say , autonomous vehicles replace America 's 3.5 million truck drivers .\nEven some economists , brilliant ones , think we 're in trouble . Robert Gordon of Northwestern suggests it in his recent book The Rise and Fall of American Growth ( Princeton University Press ) . Tyler Cowen of George Mason University does too , in Average Is Over ( Dutton ) . The great if misled John Maynard Keynes believed we would lose jobs from technology . So did the still greater David Ricardo .\nOtherwise sensible folk are , for some \u2588\u2588\u2588 , terrified by robots . Yet the results of automation are good overall . Workers move from wretched assembly-line jobs to better ones standing in white coats monitoring the robots , at the higher wages made possible by the higher tech . Or , even better , they move to jobs outside the auto industry , earning pay that goes further because people can buy the radically cheaper stuff the robots now make .\nIf their new jobs are not higher paying , it 's probably because the auto union managed to extract monopoly profits from the company , and therefore from consumers . Robert Reich , a reliable source of sweetly leftish errors of facts and ethics , declares that `` the decline in unionization [ of private companies ] directly correlates with the decline of the portion of income going to the middle class . '' But paying selected workers on the assembly line more than they can earn elsewhere , at the expense of other , sometimes poorer , workers ' ability to buy cars , is hardly an ethical formula for raising up the working class .\nWhen a Ford plant installed robots , Walter Reuther , a long-ago president of the United Auto Workers union , is said to have asked a manager : `` How are you going to get them to buy Fords ? '' But Reuther 's argument is fallacious . Employees of car companies are a trivial share of the car-buying public . You ca n't create prosperity merely by having workers purchase from their own employers .\nReich has accused the following things of driving down American wages : `` Automation , followed by computers , software , robotics , computer-controlled machine tools and widespread digitization . '' But such innovations have actually raised real wages , correctly measured , because a human supplied with a better tool can produce more outputs . And the point of an economy is production for consumption , not protection of existing jobs .\nConsider the historical record : If the nightmare of technological unemployment were true , it would already have happened , repeatedly and massively .
