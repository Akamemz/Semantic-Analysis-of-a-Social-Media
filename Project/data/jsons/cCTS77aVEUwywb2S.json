    "content": "( CNN ) If Donald Trump wins in November , his most powerful Republican ally in Washington will be House Speaker Paul Ryan -- at least , that 's the plan .\nBut the program has veered off course again and again , as the Republican nominee and the party 's top elected official struggle to maintain a fragile d\u00e9tente amid recurring public squabbles .\nOn Thursday , less than 48 hours after Trump invited new trouble by revealing he would not endorse Ryan -- or fellow GOP stalwart Arizona Sen. John McCain -- in their coming primary contests , Ryan refused to rule out withdrawing his formal support for Trump .\n`` None of these things are ever blank checks , '' the speaker told Wisconsin radio host Jerry Bader .\nA few days earlier , Trump in withholding his endorsement for Ryan had called back on the darker days of pair 's pained courtship .\n`` I like Paul , but these are horrible times for our country , '' Trump told The Washington Post . `` We need very strong leadership . We need very , very strong leadership . And I 'm just not quite there yet . I 'm not quite there yet . ''\nSound familiar ? It should . Back in May , Ryan when asked by CNN 's Jake Tapper if he was prepared to formally back Trump , said : `` I 'm not there right now . ''\nNow , a little more than three months from Election Day , the two heaviest hitters in the Republican Party are at another crossroads .\nMonths before Trump descended his gilded escalator into the primary muck , Ryan was talking up his fellow Wisconsinite , Gov . Scott Walker , as an early favorite to win the 2016 nomination .\n`` Scott 's a good friend of mine , '' Ryan said . `` I think he 's got a really good chance and I look forward to seeing how it goes for him . ''\nIt did n't go far . Like so many other would-be Republican contenders , Walker 's campaign was quickly derailed by the Trump train .\nWalker left the race in September 2015 with this message : `` I encourage other Republican presidential candidates to consider doing the same so that the voters can focus on a limited number of candidates who can offer a positive , conservative alternative to the current front-runner '' -- a reference to Trump .\nOn December 7 , just hours after a poll was released showing Ted Cruz leap-frog Trump in Iowa , the businessman put out a surprise statement `` calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country 's representatives can figure out what is going on . ''\nRyan condemned the proposal less than 24 hours later during a news conference on Capitol Hill .\n`` This is not conservatism , '' he said . `` Some of our best and biggest allies in this struggle and fight against radical Islam terror are Muslims . ''\nAnd in late February , days before Super Tuesday , he again raised eyebrows by refusing to disavow former KKK leader David Duke during a Sunday interview with Tapper .\nThat Tuesday -- primary day -- Ryan brushed back Trump again , saying : `` If a person wants to be the nominee of the Republican Party , there can be no evasion and no games . They must reject any group or cause that is built on bigotry . ''\n`` I hope , '' he added , `` this is the last time I need to speak out on this race . ''\nThree weeks later , on the day after Trump scored a major winner-take-all victory in Arizona , Ryan delivered what his office called a speech `` on the state of American politics . ''\nRyan 's remarks were mostly read as a thinly veiled rebuke of Trump\n`` Looking around at what 's taking place in politics today , it is easy to get disheartened , '' he said . `` How many of you find yourself just shaking your head at what you see from both sides ? ''\nThe front-runner landed in the Badger State and immediately proceeded to rip Walker , still popular there despite his weak turn on the national stage -- and a Ryan ally .\n`` Your governor came out , he was expected to win and we sent him packing like a little boy , '' Trump said during an interview with radio host Michael Koolidge , after Walker backed his rival , Ted Cruz .\nTrump kept up the attacks on Walker during a campaign stop in Janesville , Ryan 's hometown -- a decision one Republican strategist in the state told CNN was like `` ( poking ) Ryan in the eye . ''\nJUST WATCHED Speaker Ryan on Trump , GOP unity : `` we 're not there yet '' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Speaker Ryan on Trump , GOP unity : `` we 're not there yet '' 07:02\nSo it came as little surprise when , one month after the primary ( which Cruz won ) , Ryan now famously declared he was not prepared to endorse Trump .\n`` I 'm not there right now and I hope to though and I want to , '' he told Tapper . `` But I think what is required is that we unify this party . I think the bulk of the burden on unifying the party will have to come from the presumptive nominee . ''\nTrump responded to the challenge later in the day by putting out a press release saying : `` I am not ready to support Speaker Ryan 's agenda . Perhaps in the future we can work together and come to an agreement about what is best for the American people . They have been treated so badly for so long that it is about time for politicians to put them first ! ''\nThat was Thursday .
