    "content": "Why President Obama Picked The 'Only White Guy ' On His Shortlist\nJust after President Obama and I concluded our interview \u2014 and after the microphones and cameras clicked off \u2014 he added a thought .\nSenate Republicans ' vow not to consider the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to the U.S. Supreme Court , he said , could have profound consequences for the high court and the justices themselves .\n`` The thing that could be lost , '' said Obama , is the `` collegiality '' of the court , the ability to work together . When the confirmation gets so out of whack that it is `` just impossible , '' he said , that could bleed over and eventually erode `` the ability to disagree without being disagreeable '' that is the hallmark of an independent judiciary .\nIn a wide-ranging interview about the nomination , the president said that positive reviews about Garland from Republican senators were a significant factor in his decision to nominate the appeals court judge for a seat on the Supreme Court .\nHe called Garland `` one of the best judges , not just in the country , but of his generation . ''\nAnd yet Garland was the runner-up twice before , when Obama filled two previous openings on the Supreme Court . So why was the 63-year-old judge chosen this time ?\n`` It is my belief that now more than ever his voice would serve the court well , would help to burnish the sense that the Supreme Court is above politics and not just an extension of politics , '' said Obama , adding that Garland has the kind of calm voice that would end up `` increasing the American people 's confidence in our justice system . ''\nA few minutes later , the president was even more pointed about wanting a judge who could get confirmed .\n`` My goal was to actually confirm a justice who I thought could do an outstanding job , '' he said . `` And Merrick Garland fits that bill . ''\nConservative groups are already attacking Garland , sometimes citing reasons , sometimes opposing the nomination simply because it was made by Obama . So I asked the president about Republican Sen. John Cornyn 's pledge to make any nominee `` a pi\u00f1ata . ''\nThe president said he and Garland had a `` candid '' conversation about being in the eye of a confirmation hurricane , and what that means especially for the nominee 's family .\n`` For those of us who are more often in the scrum of politics , '' said Obama , `` we call folks like Judge Garland 'civilians . ' And so suddenly being placed in a war zone like this is something that you want to make sure they 're mindful of . ''\nI asked the president about reports that Republicans had sent a back-channel message to the White House indicating that they would confirm Garland in a lame-duck session after the election if a Democrat wins the presidency .\nHe dodged the question , saying that he had not had any such conversations with Republicans .\nThen he pivoted to say that it was Garland 's record as a `` consensus builder '' that would serve the nation well on a Supreme Court so sharply divided on many issues .\n`` I think that 's a valuable quality that has been reinforced by the statements that were made by Republicans , '' he said .\nObama said he had offered the nomination to Garland over the weekend , prompting me to observe that the nominee did a pretty good acting job at a small charity dinner Sunday night where he maintained that he did n't think he would get the nod .\nEvery time there is a Supreme Court vacancy , reporters write about the interviews that presidents conduct with the finalists . So I asked Obama what he asks in these interviews , since it would clearly be inappropriate to ask about a potential nominee 's views on a specific controversy or case .\nObama said that he sometimes asks `` about family and background and what made you want to be a judge . You learn a lot just by talking to people about what their story is .\n`` When you hear about the care with which [ Garland ] dealt with the victims and the families who had been affected by the Oklahoma City bombing , you get a sense of who that person is . ''\nThe president said he reads the candidates ' legal opinions , and as a former professor of constitutional law himself , he gets a pretty good idea of `` how they approach a case . '' And he likes to ask potential nominees how they approach a legal question when the text of the Constitution is ambiguous . It gives him `` some sense of the their judicial philosophy . ''\nIn our interview , the president made clear he wants a hearing and a vote on the Garland nomination now , not after the election . He said he intends to take his argument to the American people , on the road and elsewhere in the coming weeks , and he maintained that Republicans have now taken Senate prerogatives to the constitutional breaking point .\n`` For the first time in anyone 's memory , '' said Obama , `` you have the head of the Senate saying , ' I wo n't meet with a nominee . I wo n't provide a nominee a hearing . I will not provide a nominee a vote . ' ``\nYes , he acknowledged , there are always some politics involved in the nomination process . He acknowledged too his own role in seeking to prolong the debate on the nomination of Justice Samuel Alito in 2006 . But , he observed , Alito was not denied a hearing or a vote , a situation dramatically different from now .\nIf Republicans refuse any consideration of this nomination , he said , not only would the Supreme Court seat remain vacant for more than a year , but there would be a new precedent for senators to stymie the confirmation process as never before . And presidents of either party would only be able to fill court vacancies when their party controlled the Senate .\n`` At that point the judiciary becomes a pure extension of politics . And that damages people 's faith in the judiciary , '' Obama said .\nHe noted that a Democratic-controlled Senate confirmed Justice Anthony Kennedy 's nomination in the last year of Ronald Reagan 's presidency , and he suggested that current Senate Republicans are defying the intent of the Founding Fathers .\n`` George Washington nominated a couple of Supreme Court justices in his last year , '' Obama observed , noting puckishly that President Washington `` had better poll numbers , I 'm sure , than I did . ''\n`` What 's particularly ironic , '' added Obama , is the number of Republicans who profess `` respect for the founders ' intentions '' who are claiming that they would now `` read into the Supreme Court nomination process '' that a seat should remain vacant for `` an entire year ... because there 's an election going on . ''\nObama professed to be puzzled by Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell 's assertion that the Senate should let the American people decide , as part of the election , who gets to fill this Supreme Court seat .\n`` In fact , the American people did decide , back in 2012 when they elected me president of the United States , '' he said .\nI asked the president if he could really blame Republicans for trying to prevent a significant ideological shift on the court , in hopes that they 'll win the presidency nine months from now .\n`` This is just raw politics , '' Obama said , then expressed what he presumes is the basis for Republican opposition : `` We do n't want somebody who 's been nominated by a Democrat . ''\nWhile Obama said he understands that Republicans are `` worried and scared '' about an uprising among their base voters , there are times , he said , to stand up and be counted for the good of the country .\nAnd what of the president 's own base of voters ? Many progressives note that 4 out of 5 of the judges on Obama 's Supreme Court shortlist were minorities or women , or both . Yet he picked the only white male , a centrist liberal , not someone who would , in the view of some progressives , `` shake up '' the debate on the Supreme Court .\nObama noted that he has appointed far more women , minorities and openly gay judges to the lower courts than any other president .\n`` My record of appointing a judiciary that reflects the country is unmatched , '' he said . `` When it comes to the Supreme Court , I 've appointed two women , one Hispanic , and in each case the good news is , is that I appointed the person who I absolutely thought was the best person for the job .
