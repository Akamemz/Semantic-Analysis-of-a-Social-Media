F -- - outta here with your nice words . \u201d\nHere is more of Jarrar \u2019 s euphoric excitement and nasty name-calling that she splashed across Twitter like a garbage truck spilling it contents : `` PSA : either you are against these pieces of s -- - and their genocidal ways or you 're part of the problem . That 's actually how simple this is . I 'm happy the witch is dead . Ca n't wait for the rest of her family to fall to their demise the way 1.5 million Iraqis have . byyyeeeeeeee . \u201d\nClassy \u2013 and such a talented writer ! Does this English professor assign her students to write filth like this this , and give them bonus points for swearing ? How on Earth did she get to be an English professor , anyway ?\nAnd what kind of sick , twisted individual gleefully celebrates the death of a human being ? Unless the death you \u2019 re celebrating is that of someone like Adolf Hitler or Usama Bin Laden .\nJarrar continued her tweet storm , expressing her joy that former President George W. Bush was probably very sad his mother was dead .\nShe became even more brazen and full of herself in her tweets , flaunting her salary and saying there was no way she could ever be fired because she has tenure .

We are all held accountable for our actions . \u201d\nFar too often lately we \u2019 ve watched as conservatives have been invited to speak at universities by legitimate campus organizations only to be subjected to protests , heckling and even violence More often than not , the school administration appears to turn a blind eye to it all .\nIs rejoicing at the death of Mrs. Bush the step too far ? Have we finally seen a far-left extremist , who \u2019 s come completely unhinged , cross a line in the sand \u2013 or is this just wishful thinking ?\nThe university provost said Jarrar can be fired . So why not fire her and make her the example all academia so desperately needs ?\nJarrar talks about having the right to free speech in one of her tweets .
