Bernard Sanders on Sunday night accused Hillary Clinton of being in the pocket of Wall Street and charged that she , along with her husband , made decisions two decades ago that have devastated the middle class , while the former secretary of state shot back and said her presidential primary rival would have let the American auto industry go bankrupt .\nIn a heated debate in Flint , Michigan , the two candidates \u2014 both of whom called on Michigan Gov . Rick Snyder , a Republican , to resign over his handling of the Flint water contamination crisis \u2014 testily traded barbs days before voters in the critical Midwestern states of Michigan , Ohio and Illinois go to the polls .\nMr. Sanders , who won an impressive three primary and caucus victories to Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s one over the weekend , came out swinging against Mrs. Clinton and said massive free trade deals she supported , such as NAFTA , have contributed to the decline of the U.S. economy .\nNAFTA was enacted in the 1990s when President Clinton was in office . Mr. Sanders also blasted Mrs. Clinton for supporting normalized trade relations with China and other agreements .\n\u201c Your story is voting for every disastrous trade agreement and voting for corporate America , \u201d Mr. Sanders said , again tying Mrs. Clinton to Wall Street and zeroing in on her paid speeches to Goldman Sachs .\nHe also mocked Mrs. Clinton , saying she only recently \u201c found religion \u201d on the issue of corporate America and Wall Street firms moving jobs overseas to make more money .\n\u201c One of us has a super PAC . One of us has raised $ 15 million from Wall Street for that super PAC . One of us has given speeches on Wall Street for hundreds of thousands of dollars , \u201d he said . \u201c Now , I kind of think if you get paid a couple of hundred thousand dollars for a speech , it must be a great speech . I think we should release it and let the American people see what that transcript was . \u201d\nMrs. Clinton again refused to release her Goldman Sachs transcripts unless all other presidential candidates , including Republicans , release full transcripts of their paid speeches as well .\nBut Mrs. Clinton also returned fire on Mr. Sanders and criticized him for voting against a $ 350 billion package in 2009 that included a bailout for General Motors and Chrysler . Mr. Sanders has said he voted against the legislation because it bailed out Wall Street billionaires .\n\u201c He was against the auto bailout , \u201d Mrs. Clinton said . \u201c The money was there and had to be released in order to save the auto industry and 4 million jobs . \u2026 I voted to save the auto industry ; he voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry . \u201d\nShe also attacked Mr. Sanders for voting against the Export-Import bank , a federal agency that offers loans to American companies exporting products .\nMr. Sanders has voted against the bank and considers it a form of corporate welfare , but Mrs. Clinton argues that it is necessary to keep U.S. firms competitive in a global marketplace .\n\u201c I think we \u2019 re in a race for exports , \u201d she said .\nThe debate took place against the backdrop of the Flint water crisis , and both candidates said Mr. Snyder should step down immediately . Both candidates also made clear that they believe Environmental Protection Agency officials should resign if they are found to have been negligent , and both also left open the possibility of criminal charges against public officials .\n\u201c People should be held accountable , wherever that leads , \u201d Mrs. Clinton said . \u201c If it leads to resignations or recall if you \u2019 re in political office , it if leads to civil penalties , if it leads to criminal responsibility , there has to be an absolute accountability and I will support whatever the outcomes of those investigations are . \u201d\n\u201c After an investigation , if people , in fact , were found to have committed a criminal act , they should go to jail , \u201d he said .\nSunday night \u2019 s debate came a day after Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton traded wins in a slate of weekend primaries and caucuses .\nMr. Sanders soundly beat Mrs. Clinton in Kansas and Nebraska , while Mrs. Clinton won Louisiana .

The Saturday results still gave the former secretary of state more delegates than they did the senator .\nOverall , Mrs. Clinton has 1,121 delegates and Mr. Sanders has 481 . The figures include both pledged delegates from primaries and caucuses and so-called superdelegates , or party leaders who are free to support either candidate .\nA vast majority of those superdelegates have lined up behind Mrs. Clinton .\nMoving forward , the electoral map looks rough for Mr. Sanders .
