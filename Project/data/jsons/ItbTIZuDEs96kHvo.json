Pressed to take action on gun control , he now wants the Department to finish up and has called for the Department to propose `` a rule banning all devices that turn legal weapons into machineguns . ''\nThe potential problem for any effort to ban bump stocks through unilateral executive action is existing federal law . 26 USC \u00a75845 ( b ) defines `` machinegun '' as follows :\nany weapon which shoots , is designed to shoot , or can be readily restored to shoot , automatically more than one shot , without manual reloading , by a single function of the trigger . The term shall also include the frame or receiver of any such weapon , any part designed and intended solely and exclusively , or combination of parts designed and intended , for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun , and any combination of parts from which a machinegun can be assembled if such parts are in the possession or under the control of a person .\nAt first it may seem that bump stocks can be covered because the definition expresslys include parts that can be used to turn a semi-automatic weapon into a fully automatic one\u2014but not so fast . The problem is that the language of the statute also specifies that what makes a weapon a machine gun is the ability to fire more than one shot automatically `` by a single function of the trigger .

In other words , a bump stock is not something that enables true automatic fire as defined by the statute . It is for this \u2588\u2588\u2588 that bump stocks of the sort used by the Las Vegas shooter were not regulated as machineguns by the Obama Administration , which considered the question in 2013 .\nThe Justice Department could try and argue that the relevant statutory text should be read functionally , rather than literally .
