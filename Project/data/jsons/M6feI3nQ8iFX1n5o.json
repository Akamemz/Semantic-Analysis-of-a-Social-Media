I hope it will all turn out for the best . But I fear that it will not .\nThe election of a man temperamentally unfit for the presidency and lacking in the basic qualifications to perform the job , backed up by congressional allies who seem determined to ignore his flagrant corruption , is still an alarming situation . The odds that he will systematically corrupt American institutions and install an authoritarian kleptocracy or blunder into some kind of catastrophic war seem simply too high to entirely discount .\nAnd if something big and awful does happen , I know from my own reading of history that the scholars of the future will be sorely tempted to look for causes that are big in proportion to the consequences .\nHistorians will write of a growing trend toward partisan polarization and a brewing sense of political crisis dating back to Bill Clinton \u2019 s impeachment in 1998 . They \u2019 ll note the projected end of America \u2019 s white majority , the geopolitical revolution induced by Russia \u2019 s reinvention of itself as an international beacon of cultural conservatism , and the corrosive effect of the 2007- \u2019 08 financial crisis . The \u201c failures of neoliberalism \u201d will come in for scrutiny .\nAll true and all important . But my message to the future is this . No matter how stupid it sounds , and no matter how much political and journalistic elites on all sides of America \u2019 s toxic politics began trying to ignore it as soon as the votes were counted , the dominant issue of the 2016 campaign was email server management .\nBack in the early days of the 21st century , it was common for people to communicate via an open protocol known as email that was developed originally in the 20th century before internet access became widespread . Most email users had a \u201c personal \u201d email account but were also issued a \u201c work \u201d email account associated with their specific job . A typical personal email account would be obtained for free from an ad-supported service such as Google , Yahoo , AOL , or Microsoft . But because Bill Clinton found himself in the unusual employment circumstances of being an ex-president in 2001 , he hired someone to set up a private server for himself and his wife , and her personal email was hosted on that server .\nAt the time Clinton became secretary of state , she was a heavy user of a once-popular early smartphone line called BlackBerry .\nThe state of federal government information technology infrastructure , at the time , was such that a work-issued email address could only be associated with a work-issued BlackBerry and the work-issued BlackBerry could not be connected to a personal email address . Many federal workers at the time handled this by carrying around two smartphones , which was an annoying but workable solution . Clinton , as the boss , chose to spare herself the inconvenience involved by simply ignoring State Department guidelines and using her own phone and her personal email address .\nThis came to light some years later and sparked a politically motivated investigation into whether the use of personal email account violated not only State Department IT guidelines but also federal law regarding the handling of classified information . To convict someone under the relevant statutes , prosecutors have to show malign intent , which was pretty clearly not present , even though it turned out that some of Clinton \u2019 s email traffic did contain classified information . For this reason , FBI Director James Comey told the American people that \u201c no reasonable prosecutor \u201d would bring a case against Clinton .\nIf that sounds far too boring and unimportant to have conceivably dominated the 2016 presidential campaign , then it is difficult to disagree with you . And yet the facts are what they are . Indeed , by September 2015 \u2014 more than a year before the voting \u2014 Washington Post political writer Chris Cillizza had already written at least 50 items about the email controversy .\nEmail fever reached its peak on two separate major occasions . One was when Comey closed the investigation . Instead of simply saying \u201c we looked into it and there was no crime , \u201d Comey sought to immunize himself from Clinton critics by breaking with standard procedure to offer extended negative commentary on Clinton \u2019 s behavior . He said she was \u201c extremely careless . \u201d\nComey then brought the email story back to the center of the campaign in late October by writing a letter to Congress indicating that the email case had been reopened due to new discoveries on Anthony Weiner \u2019 s laptop . It turned out that the new discoveries were an awfully flimsy basis for a subpoena , and the subpoena turned up nothing .\nThis all still sounds unimportant , but it was not at the time :\nCritically , one useful function of email-based criticism of Hillary Clinton was to pull together the Trumpian and establishment wings of the Republican Party . That \u2019 s why it served as the central theme of the 2016 Republican convention , allowing the likes of Scott Walker and Rick Perry to deliver on-message speeches rather than clashing with Trump \u2019 s message .\nHistorians looking through the archives of stories published in November and December 2016 will find billions of words published on the nature of Trump \u2019 s appeal to voters who liked him .
