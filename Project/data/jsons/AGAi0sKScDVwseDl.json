Though the department has avoided providing cost comparisons , the Heritage Foundation , a conservative think tank , did their best to crunch the numbers based on the current costs of insurance through nongroup plans ( the closest equivalent to the Obamacare exchanges that existed before Oct. 1 ) in each state and the average costs for insurance through the exchanges . According to their data , Obamacare will cause costs to decline in only five states . [ Watchdog.org 10/22/13 ]\nReality : Heritage Foundation Study Fails To Take Into Account Cost-Saving Subsidies\nHuffington Post : \u201c The Heritage Analysis Is Deceptive Because It Does Not Factor In Substantial Premium Subsidies. \u201d According to an op-ed by Ethan Rome , executive director of Health Care for America Now , on the Huffington Post , the Heritage Foundation study is flawed because it does not factor in tax credits that many exchange customers will access to make coverage more affordable :\nThe Heritage analysis is deceptive because it does not factor in the substantial premium subsidies most consumers will receive to help them pay for their insurance . Heritage simply pretends these subsidies , in the form of tax credits , do not exist . Leaving out the most important factor in this equation is precisely how the \u201c Heritage Health Insurance Microsimulation Model \u201d reached a conclusion that supports the political agenda of Republican extremists who can think of no domestic policy other than attacking the ACA . Unlike Heritage , consumers wo n't pretend the tax credits do n't exist . The premium subsidies are a big reason ACA coverage will be affordable . For example , while the premium for a particular plan may be $ 241 a month , the cost to the consumer after applying the tax credit may be only $ 143 a month . That 's a huge difference . [ Huffington Post , 10/21/13 ]\nTax Credits Will Help A Majority Of Uninsured Exchange Shoppers And Should Be Included In Cost Calculations . According to Talking Points Memo , tax credits should be included in premium cost calculations because they will be provided to a majority of those shopping for insurance on the exchanges :\nUnder Obamacare , the sticker price for insurance is n't what most people are going to actually pay . The law offers tax credits , on a sliding scale , for people making between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level . According to estimates from the Kaiser Family Foundation , more than half of uninsured Americans have an income within that range . Another 38 percent fall below the poverty line . They are supposed to be eligible for Medicaid under the law , and millions in poverty will be covered that way . However , more than 20 Republican states -- with an assist from the U.S. Supreme Court -- have refused to expand Medicaid coverage to them . So people in those states are admittedly out of luck , but that was n't the ACA 's intention . That leaves only 10 percent of uninsured Americans who make above 400 percent of the poverty level and , as the law was conceived , would be paying the premiums that Heritage highlights in its analysis . [ Talking Points Memo , 10/21/13 ]\nMyth # 2 : Young People Will Not Sign Up Because Of Costs , Would Rather Go Without Coverage\nWatchdog.org : \u201c Some Pretty Good Evidence That Young People Would n't Be Flocking To The Exchanges \u201d Even If They Worked . Watchdog.org claimed there were indications that young people would not sign up for the ACA on the exchanges due to rising costs :\nBut there already is some pretty good evidence that young people would n't be flocking to the exchanges even if they were in good working order . And that 's a big deal , because the arithmetic behind Obamacare requires that lots of young , relatively healthy people buy insurance and effectively subsidize the cost of the older , less healthy , more expensive people in the system . As Cathy Reisenwitz wrote last week , this is why the whole scheme should n't be called insurance at all - because it 's really cost-pooling . [ ... ] And why are lots of young people not showing up for Obamacare ? Refer back to the first point . While all adults will see higher premiums in most states , the increases are generally sharper for young people . [ Watchdog.org 10/22/13 ]\nReality : Young People Want Insurance And Largely Qualify For Tax Credits That Will Make Coverage Affordable\nCNN Money : \u201c Only 5 % Of [ Millennials ] Claim They Do Not Want Or Need Health Insurance. \u201d According to an October 21 CNN Money op-ed piece by Matthew Segal , president of OurTime.org , a group dedicated to enhancing the voice of young Americans , polls have found that only 5 percent of young people say they do not want or need health insurance :\nThere are currently 17 million uninsured Millennials now eligible to get health insurance through the Affordable Care Act . Only 5 % of them claim they do not want or need health insurance , according to some polls . In other words , despite what the opt-out crusaders might lead you to believe , young people are n't so foolish to think they will never get sick , fall down , become pregnant , develop a food allergy , or face any other spur-of the moment illness , which can cost thousands of dollars . Let 's not forget that more than 50 % of all personal bankruptcies in the pre-Obamacare world were due to unforeseen medical expenses . [ CNN Money , 10/21/13 ]\nThe Washington Post : \u201c 90 Percent Of Uninsured Young Adults Will Qualify For [ ACA 's ] More Generous Subsidies. \u201d According to Washington Post 's Wonkblog , 90 percent of uninsured young adults will qualify for tax credits :\nTo start , about 90 percent of uninsured young adults will qualify for the law 's more generous subsidies . Census data shows there are about 11 million Americans between 20 and 29 . Eight-seven percent of them have incomes below 400 percent of the federal poverty line , meaning they will qualify for some level of a tax subsidy or for the Medicaid program . The bar on the far left represents the 4.83 million young adults who earn less than 138 percent of the federal poverty line and will become eligible for Medicaid . That entitlement program does not use the age rating provisions used in the private market , meaning that one-third of young adults wo n't interact with this part of Obamacare in any way . The three bars in the middle show young adults who will become eligible for subsidies under the Affordable Care Act . Those subsidies will cap the young adults spending on health insurance as a percent of income . Let 's take an individual who earns $ 22,240 , which works out to 200 percent of the poverty line . That person would get enough tax subsidies so that , at most , he was spending $ 1,407 annually on health insurance ( a $ 117 monthly premium ) . [ The Washington Post , 2/11/13 ]\nMSNBC : Choosing To Pay The Penalty Instead Of Purchasing Insurance Makes Little Financial Sense . An August 9 MSNBC piece on the benefits of younger , healthy Americans purchasing insurance explained that most young Americans will qualify for subsidies to make their insurance more affordable and that passing on a health care plan could leave them subject to \u201c financial ruin \u201d if they need serious medical care :\nObamacare also uses tax credits to discount most young people 's coverage . Anyone with an income between 100 % and 400 % of the federal poverty level ( $ 11,490 to $ 45,960 in 2013 ) -- which is to say the vast majority of healthy young adults -- will benefit accordingly . In Los Angeles , a 25-year-old man earning $ 17,235 will pay $ 34 per month for silver-level coverage next year . That 's 80 % less than the same coverage would cost without the discount ( $ 174 per month ) . Suppose that young man heeds the FreedomWorks call to action . By passing on the health insurance and paying a penalty of $ 27 per month ( the fixed rate for anyone making less than $ 32,500 ) , he 'll save himself a grand total of $ 7 per month -- the price of a turkey sandwich . He may really want the sandwich , but he should understand that it 's not a free lunch . He 's actually choosing between two purchases . He can pay $ 27 a month for ... nothing . Or he can pay $ 34 for a health plan that provides ready access to primary care and could spare him financial ruin if he suffers a serious illness or injury . \u201c It usually costs a little more to buy the plan than pay the penalty , \u201d says Jay Angoff , the Washington-based attorney who oversaw the initial rollout of Obamacare for the Department of Health and Human Services . \u201c But if you look at what you 're getting in return , there 's no contest . For most people , paying an extra few bucks a month to get health insurance is the rational choice. \u201d [ MSNBC , 8/9/13 , emphasis added ]\nWatchdog.org : Because Of The ACA , \u201c People May Have A Pretty Good Incentive To Avoid Things Like Marriage And Job Promotions That Pay Them A Higher Salary. \u201d According to Watchdog.org , the way subsidies are structured under the ACA -- higher subsidies for individuals making less income -- will encourage people to avoid getting married and combining incomes :\nBecause of how the subsidies in the Affordable Care Act are structured , people may have a pretty good incentive to avoid things like marriage and job promotions that pay them a higher salary .

According to Think Progress , providing subsidies for coverage to individuals makes sense because they are more likely to be uninsured , while married couples \u201c benefit from economies of scale \u201d and are more likely to have insurance :\nThe affordability credits are pegged to the federal poverty guidelines , which treat married people as a unit and view individuals as separate parties filing separate tax returns . These guidelines assume , as Judith Solomon points out , that \u201c people benefit from economies of scale when they 're living together \u201d and recognizes that unmarried individuals have fewer resources ( lower incomes , more money spent on basic necessities ) than married families . In fact , since the majority of the uninsured are not married and marrying lowers uninsurance rates , providing more subsidies to individuals is a better way of targeting affordability credits to those who need them most . [ Think Progress , 10/27/11 ]\nMarried People Are More Likely To Have Insurance Than Single People . According to 2009 Census data compiled by Think Progress , married individuals are more likely to have insurance when compared to single people .\nNew Republic : Married People Receiving The Same Benefits As Single People Would Give Couples A Distinct Advantage .
