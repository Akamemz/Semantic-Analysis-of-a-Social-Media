Ol \u2019 Joe is just out of touch ! He doesn \u2019 t know you can \u2019 t use words like that .

And yet , Iran relies on a network of proxy actors from Yemen , Syria , Iraq and Lebanon . Must they all respect Mr. Trump \u2019 s red line ? There are plenty of hotheads in those proxy forces that will be incensed by the assassination , the same way young men with weapons and minimal discipline often are\u2026 Mr. Trump can \u2019 t keep an entire region from crossing his red line , making violent conflict all the more likely if the president holds to it\u2026\n\u201c There is tremendous confusion about what the Judiciary Committee is up to\u2026 even Democratic lawmakers don \u2019 t seem to know whether they are engaged in an impeachment inquiry .

Neither really happened\u2026 \u201c The central topic of the hearing was about how Trump told Lewandowski to deliver a message to Jeff Sessions that he should rein in the Mueller investigation . It \u2019 s scandalous stuff . But it turns out the message never even got to Sessions , and the Mueller investigation got to continue \u2014 making it another case in which Trump \u2019 s obstruction attempts ended up being more incompetent than effective . So for those Democrats hoping to change the political dynamics of impeachment , this hearing will likely go down as a failure \u2014 and a sign of potential trouble to come. \u201d Andrew Prokop , Vox\n\u201c [ Lewandowski ] rolled his eyes .

This is a big deal -- or should be. But it also was nothing new. The entire summer 2017 episode is set forth in detail in the Mueller report. Lewandowski's testimony simply confirms that Mueller got it right -- contrary to the repeated claims of Lewandowski's chief benefactor Trump, who has repeatedly attacked Mueller's impartiality and veracity\u2026 \u201c House Democrats need to address this question squarely : Is the conduct in the Mueller report enough to impeach? If so, then why are we wasting time with the kind of absurd hearing we saw on Tuesday? (Note: they don't need more -- the House impeached President Bill Clinton based on the written report of Independent Counsel Ken Starr, without calling live witnesses).
