    "content": "The VA 's Broken Promise To Thousands Of Vets Exposed To Mustard Gas\nIn secret chemical weapons experiments conducted during World War II , the U.S. military exposed thousands of American troops to mustard gas .\nWhen those experiments were formally declassified in the 1990s , the Department of Veterans Affairs made two promises : to locate about 4,000 men who were used in the most extreme tests , and to compensate those who had permanent injuries .\nBut the VA did n't uphold those promises , an NPR investigation has found .\nNPR interviewed more than 40 living test subjects and family members , and they describe an unending cycle of appeals and denials as they struggled to get government benefits for mustard gas exposure . Some gave up out of frustration .\nIn more than 20 years , the VA attempted to reach just 610 of the men , with a single letter sent in the mail . Brad Flohr , a VA senior adviser for benefits , says the agency could n't find the rest , because military records of the experiments were incomplete .\n`` There was no identifying information , '' he says . `` No Social Security numbers , no addresses , no ... way of identifying them . Although , we tried . ''\nYet in just two months , an NPR research librarian located more than 1,200 of them , using the VA 's own list of test subjects and public records .\nThe mustard gas experiments were conducted at a time when American intelligence showed that enemy gas attacks were imminent . The tests evaluated protective equipment like gas masks and suits . They also compared the relative sensitivity of soldiers , including tests designed to look for racial difference .\nThe test subjects who are still alive are now in their 80s and 90s . Each year more of their stories die with them .\n`` We were n't told what it was , '' says Charlie Cavell , who was 19 when he volunteered for the program in exchange for two weeks ' vacation . `` Until we actually got into the process of being in that room and realized , wait a minute , we ca n't get out of here . ''\nCavell and 11 other volunteers were locked inside a gas chamber with mustard gas piping inside . Blocks of ice sat on shelves overhead with fans blowing across them to increase the humidity in the room , which intensified mustard gas 's effects on the body . After an hour , the officer released six of the men back to their barracks . Cavell and five others were told to stay put .\nInside the chamber , Cavell 's skin started to turn red and burn in the places where he sweat the most : between his legs , behind his neck and under his arms . Blisters that eventually increased to the size of half dollar coins started to grow in the same places . At the end of the second hour , the officer ordered Cavell back to his barracks and to continue wearing his gas-saturated uniform .\nAbout This Investigation This is Part 2 of a two-part investigation on mustard gas testing conducted by the U.S. military during World War II . The first story in this report focused on race-based experiments done as part of the military 's chemical warfare program : NPR News Investigations Secret World War II Chemical Experiments Tested Troops By Race\nCavell , now 88 years old , says the officer threatened him and the other test subjects : If they told anyone about their knowledge or participation in the experiments , they would receive a dishonorable discharge and be sent to military prison at Fort Leavenworth , Kan .\n`` They put the fear of God in just a bunch of young kids , '' he says .\nThese experiments with mustard gas were conducted by the Army and Navy at more than a dozen locations . Some test subjects had only partial exposure , such as having the chemical agents applied directly onto their skin . Others were locked in gas chambers , like Cavell . A third type of test exposed troops to gas outdoors in simulated combat settings .\nIn all , roughly 60,000 World War II veterans were used as test subjects , and they kept the experiments secret for half a century . A group of them , led by Nat Schnurman , went public with their stories in 1990 .\nSchnurman , who died in 2013 when he was 87 , had suffered debilitating injuries after being tested at the U.S . Naval Training Center in Bainbridge , Md . He filed a federal lawsuit for compensation in 1979 , but was unsuccessful because of a legal doctrine that protects the military from being sued for service-related injuries . Schnurman and his wife , Joy , spent the next two decades compiling evidence of the testing in order to put pressure on the military .\nWhen the story broke , VA Deputy Secretary Anthony Principi appeared on 60 Minutes , in 1991 , to explain how the agency would respond to men who were injured in the tests : `` They should be praised for what they did , '' Principi said on the CBS News program . `` And as far as the secretary and I are concerned , we 're about to do right by them . ''\nMore than 20 years later , the VA has attempted to contact fewer than a quarter of the thousands it said it would .\nOne of the men who never heard from the VA was John Berzellini . His wife , Irene , remembers how the experiments affected his health for the rest of his life .\n`` I remember him laying up in the bedroom up there , '' she says .\nBerzellini says every winter her husband spent weeks in bed with chronic bronchitis \u2014 an illness government studies have linked to mustard gas exposure . She says they did n't know that he was eligible for disability benefits when he died of a heart attack in 1995 .\nIn the early 1990s , VA officials also announced the agency would lower its burden of proof to make getting benefits easier in these cases . The process typically relies on evidence , but most of the men in these experiments have none because the tests were done in secret .\n`` This is not an easy , not a simple thing , '' Flohr says . `` But we have done everything that we could do , I definitely believe that . ''\nThe VA created a list of illnesses that are linked to mustard gas exposure \u2014 such as skin cancer , leukemia and chronic breathing problems . According to the agency , if a veteran has an illness on the list and can prove he was exposed , he receives benefits .\nBut NPR interviewed veterans who met both of those requirements and have still been denied for years \u2014 sometimes decades \u2014 as the VA continues to request more information and proof .\nCavell says that even today , when he comes to a locked door he 's reminded of the inside of a gas chamber .\n`` There was no handle on the door . You could n't get out , '' he says . `` And that 's what I have problems with today . If I go to a locked door , I panic sometimes to try to get out . ''\nIn 1988 , Cavell requested copies of his records from the experiments he was in at the Naval Research Laboratory . Researchers there had recorded his full name in neat handwriting on lined paper . They had detailed the length of time he spent inside a gas chamber and the level of mustard gas in the air .\nCavell then submitted the documents to the VA as proof of his exposure . He filed claims for several illnesses on the VA 's list of those linked to mustard gas , including skin cancer and chronic breathing problems . But until NPR inquired about his case , all of those claims had been denied .\nAfter NPR 's inquiry , the VA told NPR there was enough evidence to grant his claims . They based that conclusion on the same information that had been sitting in his VA file for decades . Officials say they ca n't explain why the benefits were n't granted sooner . Cavell is currently being re-evaluated before the benefits can be disbursed .\nFormer CIA Director Porter Goss says the VA has mishandled these claims . Goss was a Florida congressman when he was contacted by a group of constituents who were used as test subjects and spoke out on their behalf . `` This should have been ancient history by now , '' he told NPR . `` And these people should have long been appropriately provided for . ''\nGoss says he thinks the VA never delivered on its promises because this issue has been disappearing on its own for years . About 500 World War II veterans die each day , according to data maintained by the VA. `` I do think there is a little bit of that attitude of : 'This is today 's problem , it will be gone by tomorrow , ' `` Goss says . `` But this is a bargain we made . And this goes to the essence of 'Can you trust your government ? ' And in this case I 'm afraid the answer is not yet . ''\nFlohr tells NPR his agency has followed federal statutes in its handling of claims for mustard gas exposure . But Goss says that excuse is at the core of all that is dysfunctional in Washington bureaucracies . `` I do n't think there 's an explanation for why this program was n't more successful , '' Goss says . `` If I were back in Congress , I 'd be asking that question . ''\nCongress has intervened in similar situations .
