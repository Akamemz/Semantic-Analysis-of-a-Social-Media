Steve King ( R-Iowa ) , a controversial member with a long history of making racist remarks , in a primary earlier this month .\nNow GOP lawmakers , aides and operatives fear Greene \u2014 a wealthy businesswoman who has already drawn national attention because of her belief in a trove of QAnon conspiracy theories \u2014 could create an even bigger black eye for the party if she wins the nomination . Greene will face neurosurgeon John Cowan in the Aug. 11 primary runoff .\n\u201c These comments are appalling , and Leader McCarthy has no tolerance for them , \u201d said Drew Florio , a spokesman for House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( R-Calif. ) .\nHouse Minority Whip Steve Scalise ( R-La . ) went further , throwing his weight behind Greene \u2019 s opponent .\n\u201c The comments made by Ms. Greene are disgusting and don \u2019 t reflect the values of equality and decency that make our country great , \u201d Scalise said in a statement . \u201c I will be supporting Dr. Cowan . \u201d\nIn recordings obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 , Greene described Islamic nations under Sharia law as places where men have sex with `` little boys , little girls , multiple women '' and `` marry their sisters '' and `` their cousins . '' She suggested the 2018 midterms \u2014 which ushered in the most diverse class of House freshmen \u2014 was part of \u201c an Islamic invasion of our government \u201d and that \u201c anyone that is a Muslim that believes in Sharia law does not belong in our government . \u201d\nIn other videos , she directly compared Black Lives Matter activists to the neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members who marched at a white nationalist rally three years ago in Charlottesville , Va. , denouncing them all as \u201c idiots. \u201d And Greene forcefully rejected the notion there are racial disparities in the U.S. or that skin color affects the \u201c quality \u201d of one 's life : \u201c Guess what ? Slavery is over , \u201d she said . \u201c Black people have equal rights . \u201d\nWhen asked for comment on quotes from the videos , Greene campaign manager Isaiah Wartman did not deny their veracity but declined to elaborate .\n\u201c Thank [ s ] for the reminder about Soros . We forgot to put him in our newest ad . We \u2019 re fixing that now , \u201d he wrote in an email to \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c Would you like me to send you a copy ? \u201d\nSitting cross-legged on the floor and sporting an American flag baseball cap , Greene said in one video that unemployment \u2014 which affects people of color at disproportionately higher rates \u2014 is simply the product of \u201c bad choices \u201d and being \u201c lazy . \u201d\nMinorities , Greene added , are being held back in society by gangs , drugs , a lack of education , Planned Parenthood and abortions \u2014 \u201c not white people . \u201d\n\u201c I know a ton of white people that are as lazy and sorry and probably worse than black people , \u201d she said . \u201c And that has everything to do with their bad choices and their personal responsibility . That is not a skin-color issue . \u201d\nGreene later implied that black women have it easier because of affirmative action , complaining they are more likely to get into a college than a white male if they have the same GPA .\n\u201c The most mistreated group of people in the United States today are white males , \u201d Greene said as she wrapped up one of the videos .\nThe recordings , in which Greene spends hours ranting to her social media followers , were taped direct-to-camera . The date of the videos is not clear , but they appear to have been recorded between late 2017 and early 2019 . She initially launched a campaign in June of last year for Democratic Rep. Lucy McBath \u2019 s seat in Atlanta 's northern suburbs , but switched to the staunchly conservative 14th District when Rep. Tom Graves ( R-Ga. ) announced his plans to retire .\nThe top three House GOP leaders , as well as the head of the party \u2019 s campaign arm , denounced Greene \u2019 s rhetoric upon learning from \u2588\u2588\u2588 of her derogatory comments about blacks , Muslims and Jews .\nWhile the National Republican Congressional Committee does not get involved in primaries , NRCC spokesman Chris Pack said Chairman Tom Emmer ( R-Minn. ) is \u201c personally disgusted by this rhetoric and condemns it in the strongest possible terms . \u201d\nAnd a spokesman for House Republican Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney ( R-Wyo . ) \u2014 who forcefully rebuked King and called on him to step down \u2014 said , \u201c obviously , Rep. Cheney opposes these offensive and bigoted comments . \u201d\nMcCarthy already pulled his support for another controversial GOP candidate in California , Ted Howze , after \u2588\u2588\u2588 uncovered dozens of social media posts that demeaned Muslims and immigrants .\nDespite Greene \u2019 s penchant for controversy \u2014 she has already faced public criticism for taking a photo with a white supremacist , floating a conspiracy theory that the Las Vegas shooting massacre was a plot to abolish the Second Amendment and calling one of the student activists from Parkland high school \u201c little Hitler \u201d \u2014 Greene has earned some congressional support .\nShe nabbed endorsements from Rep. Andy Biggs ( R-Ariz. ) , the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus ; Rep. Jim Jordan ( R-Ohio ) , one of President Donald Trump \u2019 s closest allies on Capitol Hill ; Rep. Jody Hice ( R-Ga. ) , a Freedom Caucus member and former pastor ; and the House Freedom Fund , the political arm for the Freedom Caucus . Jordan and Hice both said they disagree with her statements but have not yet pulled their endorsements ; Biggs did not respond to a request for comment for this story .\nThere is now a growing effort in the GOP to rally around Greene \u2019 s opponent . Georgia Reps . Buddy Carter and Drew Ferguson both backed Cowan on Wednesday morning , as did Rep. Austin Scott . Ferguson called her comments \u201c abhorrent \u201d and said in a statement that she \u201c shouldn \u2019 t have a place in Congress . \u201d\nScott echoed a similar sentiment , saying \u201c her statements would render her incapable of being an effective member of Congress . \u201d\n\u201c This isn \u2019 t something that happened 10 years ago , when she said something out of context , \u201d Scott said in an interview .\nHouse Democrats have also pounced on Greene , even before the publication of the videos . Rep. Cheri Bustos of Illinois , the chair of the House Democratic campaign arm , called her a \u201c next-generation Steve King \u201d in a statement .\nAnd Greene \u2019 s opponent , Cowan , is making a similar argument ahead of the runoff .\n`` These comments do not reflect the views of the people of the 14th District , '' he said in an interview . `` I think she would embarrass our state , and I \u2019 m going to do everything I can to keep her from representing northwest Georgia in Congress . ''\nIn one of the videos , Greene offered a full-throated defense of Confederate statues , saying that if she were a black person she would be \u201c proud \u201d to see a Confederate monument `` because I \u2019 d say , \u2018 Look how far I have come in this country . \u2019 \u201d\nHer comments are surfacing amid a heated national debate over whether Confederate statues should be removed and whether military bases named after Confederate leaders should be renamed \u2014 a debate that is also unfolding in Congress .\nGreene blamed the country \u2019 s racial wounds on \u201c identity politics \u201d and President Barack Obama , who , she said , won black voters only because of \u201c the color of his skin. \u201d She also suggested that \u2019 s why Obama identifies as black , even though he is \u201c half-white \u201d and \u201c American , \u201d Greene noted .\nAnd during another offensive diatribe , Greene accused Democrats of \u201c trying to keep the black people in a modern-day form of slavery \u201d and said black Republicans get called \u201c coon \u201d and \u201c Uncle Toms \u201d by liberal black voters .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a slavery system to keep their vote , \u201d she said .\nIn her videos , Greene is particularly preoccupied with the increase in Muslim members of Congress . She referred to freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar ( D-Minn. ) as `` that woman out of Minnesota '' who `` has got to wear a head covering . '' She said members should not be able to take the oath of office on a Koran : `` No ! You have to be sworn in on the Bible . ''\nIn 2018 , Omar and freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib ( D-Mich. ) became the first two Muslim women elected to Congress . They have become top targets of the right , along with freshman Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts , who are also women of color .\n`` There is an Islamic invasion into our government offices right now , \u201d Greene said . \u201c You saw after midterm elections what we saw so many Muslims elected .
