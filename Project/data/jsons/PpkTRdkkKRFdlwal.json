    "content": "Some suggest that Congress \u201c remove Trump from office , so that he can not abuse incumbency to subvert the electoral process , but let the American people make the judgment on whether or not he gets a second term\u2026 Removing Trump from office for the remainder of his term would disable him from abusing presidential power again and protect the integrity of the electoral process from inappropriate interference . At the same time , letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump , despite his attempt to subvert the system , should have another chance\u2026 Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus . As long as Trump can run again , Republicans can not hide behind a claim that they are [ the ] ones protecting voter choice by opposing impeachment. \u201d Edward B. Foley , Politico\n\u201c It \u2019 s useful to spur debate on the right mix of migrants , which in our view would include both the skilled and educated and the kind of scrappy , hungry settlers who have supercharged this nation \u2019 s economy since its founding . The real test is whether the Trump plan is the basis of dealmaking or just a talking point designed to win over suburban voters in swing districts . As the president likes to say : We \u2019 ll see. \u201d Editorial Board , Washington Post\nCounterpoint : \u201c [ Merit-based ] immigration has worked in Canada . Unlike in the United States , a vast majority of immigrants to Canada are evaluated on their skills and qualifications and whether those match the needs of the labor market . It \u2019 s an imperfect system \u2014 what policy isn \u2019 t ? \u2014 but it is the reason Canadians are broadly content that their country has one of the highest rates of immigration in the world . The success of the merit-based system also permits the government to have the generous refugee and humanitarian policies that it does\u2026 the left would be wise to reset [ the immigration ] debate by agreeing to focus on highly skilled immigrants. \u201d Omer Aziz , New York Times\nMany argue that \u201c we need more workers , at all wage levels \u2026 we have about 7.5 million unfilled jobs and the fertility rate in the United States plunged to a 30 year low. \u201d Jennifer Rubin , Washington Post\n\u201c We expect people to arrive from somewhere else in the world , become American , have children who grow up as Americans , and possess loyalty , common civic values and a sense of shared identity . This is a dimension of immigration in which the United States probably has the world \u2019 s strongest track record . But practically speaking , how does that actually happen ? \u2026 \u201c Throughout U.S. history , families and extended family networks have offered intense social , cultural and financial help to new immigrants . They assist newcomers in finding housing and jobs , as well as translating important information , such as tax , DMV and school registration forms . Many also provide emotional and psychological support and communicate U.S. cultural norms throughout the adjustment process\u2026 Are we setting ourselves up to host a set of people who see themselves as global winners , looking to negotiate the best residency deal for themselves without emotional connections to us or intellectual regard for our ideals ? \u201d Julia Brookins , NBC News\n\u201c While at first this may seem good for tech \u2014 an industry experiencing cutthroat competition for the limited number of US tech workers \u2014 it \u2019 s completely unrealistic . You can \u2019 t expect people to move and work here without the hope of bringing their families with them \u2026 \u2018 [ They are ] trying to create a dichotomy between supposedly low-skill , low-paid , family immigrants and high-tech , high-wage , not-jobs-stealing , merit-based immigrants\u2026 [ but ] the fact is everyone has family \u2019 ... People coming to work in the US \u2014 who aid American companies and generally benefit the overall economy \u2014 are entitled to live full lives. \u201d Rani Molla , Vox\nIt was a \u201c lost opportunity\u2026 this proposal does not address some of the thorniest elements of the immigration debate . Most notably , it avoids the question of what to do about the 1.8 million immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children\u2026 No proposal that fails to grapple with this vulnerable population will be taken seriously by Democrats \u2014 nor should it be . The plan also does not address how to bring the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States out of the shadows. \u201d Editorial Board , New York Times\nThe right supports the plan , arguing in favor of a merit-based immigration system .\nThe right supports the plan , arguing in favor of a merit-based immigration system .\n\u201c The United States , unique among developed countries , maintains a quixotic and outdated immigration system\u2014created in 1965\u2014in which the vast majority of immigrants are admitted through family reunification\u2026 [ This plan ] would merely bring U.S. immigration policy into alignment with what the rest of the developed world does\u2026 we need a modernized immigration system that puts the American economy and American interests first . That \u2019 s the direction Trump \u2019 s plan would take us , and it \u2019 s about time . \u201d\n\u201c America would still be a beacon for freedom and opportunity across the globe . The refugee program \u2014 providing a safe harbor to those who are escaping persecution \u2014 would be preserved . First in line to gain visas would still be immediate family members of American citizens\u2026\n\u201c The United States is like an NFL team that every year can have every first-round draft pick .

Foolishly , we have turned them away\u2026 Under the Trump plan , the percent of immigrants with college and advanced degrees would nearly double , according to the White House \u2019 s calculations . And many of these degrees will be in engineering , the sciences and technology . We need them . \u201d\n\u201c The people who own software companies think we need more immigrant programmers ; the people who work as programmers often have other views\u2026 the buyers and the sellers in any given market often see things very differently from each other\u2026 The United States has interests of its own , some of those interests are economic , and immigration should serve American interests first and foremost , with humanitarian concerns and other considerations subordinated . \u201d\n\u201c Admitting immigrants on the basis that they \u2019 d make Americans better off \u2014 who could oppose that ? ... One thing I like about the proposed bill is that it doesn \u2019 t cap the number of people we \u2019 d admit . [ Under a previously proposed bill ] , we \u2019 d admit no more than 500,000 people a year . But if the 500,001st immigrant would make us better off , why would we reject him ? \u201d\n\u201c Trump must feel more comfortable with keeping the legal immigration level where it is . It \u2019 s consistent with his American Greatness theme to want to admit large numbers of the best and brightest from around the world . And his base , while many in it would probably prefer less legal immigration , isn \u2019 t likely to balk over keeping such immigration where it is , as long as the system is predominantly merit based\u2026 perhaps most importantly , by keeping legal immigration where it is , Trump can easily dodge the charge of being anti-immigrant . He can say he \u2019 s pro-immigrant \u2014 but pro-legal immigrants with skills and with proficiency in English . \u201d\nSome , however , are critical that the plan does not reduce the number of legal immigrants . \u201c The proposal is not really a legislative vehicle ; there \u2019 s no chance an immigration bill even remotely acceptable to Republicans can make it through this Congress . That means this proposal is more of a campaign platform , outlining the official Republican approach to immigration .
