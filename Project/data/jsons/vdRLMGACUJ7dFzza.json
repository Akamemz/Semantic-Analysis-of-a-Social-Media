    "content": "\u2588\u2588\u2588 has obtained a memo in which an ICE whistleblower says two immigrants got preventable surgeries and two were given the wrong drugs . Four died \u2014 one after getting `` grossly negligent '' care .\nImmigrants held in Immigration and Customs Enforcement jails around the US received medical care so bad it resulted in two preventable surgeries , including an 8-year-old boy who had to have part of his forehead removed , and contributed to four deaths , according to an internal complaint from an agency whistleblower . The allegations appear in an explosive Department of Homeland Security memo , obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 , containing reports of detainees being given incorrect medication , suffering from delays in treating withdrawal symptoms , and one who was allowed to become so mentally unstable he lacerated his own penis and required reparative surgery .\nThe whistleblower reported that three people had died in ICE lockup after receiving inadequate medical treatment or oversight , and said official reports on a fourth person \u2019 s death were \u201c very misleading. \u201d One man died from meningitis following \u201c grossly negligent \u201d care . Another killed himself after saying he would do exactly that months earlier . The allegations were laid out in a March 20 memorandum signed by Cameron Quinn , DHS \u2019 s officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties , and sent to top ICE leadership . The memo describes the whistleblower as someone within the ICE Health Service Corps , or IHSC , which provides medical care and oversight for detainees in the agency \u2019 s custody . \u2588\u2588\u2588 does not know the person \u2019 s identity . The whistleblower \u2019 s allegations were first received by the Homeland Security \u2019 s inspector general in April 2018 . In July of that year , the inspector general sent the allegations to Quinn \u2019 s office , which will investigate the medical care and oversight IHSC provides at a time when President Donald Trump demonizes immigrants , detains them in record numbers , and enacts restrictive policies to keep them out of the US . The allegations in the DHS memo , if corroborated , are a cry from someone working for ICE echoing what advocates , lawsuits , and other media reports have been saying for years : The medical care ICE provides and oversees for immigrants in private and local jails could be very bad . This internal memo is one of a trove of remarkable secret documents \u2014 including emails , briefing materials , and draft reports \u2014 \u2588\u2588\u2588 has obtained throughout 2019 uncovering how the Trump administration \u2019 s immigration policies were formed and executed , and how those policies confused or harmed people who sought to immigrate to the US . These records have revealed how immigrants locked up at the US border had no access to showers and how children were held in closed and crowded cells ; that US border officials apparently pressured the asylum office to deny immigrants entry into the US ; that a Texas detention center waited more than seven hours to transfer an ailing 37-year-old Mexican man to a hospital , where he died from bleeding in his brain ; and that in the final days before launching a controversial plan to deport Central American asylum-seekers to Guatemala , US officials scrambled to answer basic questions such as how people would get shelter , food , and social services . \u2588\u2588\u2588 has retyped the memo based on the whistleblower \u2019 s allegations , providing its full text , because metadata or other information in the original could compromise a source \u2019 s identity . \u2588\u2588\u2588 redacted the names of most immigrants and ICE middle managers and their contact information . [ Make more work like this possible : Become a \u2588\u2588\u2588 member today . ] The memo describes what happened to 17 different immigrants who were held at nine facilities across six states , from Georgia to Washington . The allegations include : That immigrants received incorrect medications . One man was given an antidepressant instead of an antipsychotic drug , likely worsening his condition . Another was given aspirin despite having thin blood \u2014 he nearly died .\nThat four immigrants endured severe withdrawal symptoms while in ICE custody . One man addicted to opioids was the subject of a \u201c medication error \u201d ; two men with a benzodiazepine addiction saw delays in treatment ; and one man \u201c went into severe alcohol withdrawal and delirium and was admitted to the hospital in the intensive care unit . \u201d\nThat IHSC leadership was unresponsive or even dishonest when confronted . They \u201c failed to take appropriate action \u201d when told of policy violations in 10 of the cases ; \u201c did not respond \u201d to concerns about one case in which a detainee with non-Hodgkin \u2019 s lymphoma died under \u201c deplorable \u201d conditions ; and were \u201c erroneous \u201d and told others to \u201c hold off \u201d when looking into several cases . Overall , the memo says , the whistleblower alleged that IHSC \u201c has systematically provided inadequate medical and mental health care and oversight to immigration detainees across the U.S. \u201d The memo also says the inspector general will investigate the whistleblower \u2019 s allegation that they were retaliated against for raising the issues .\nThe memo was distributed within the agency \u2014 but a former senior ICE official who was aware of the allegations and the response told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that ICE leadership appeared to not take a close look at the allegations . \u201c This is significant and very damning , \u201d the former official , who requested anonymity in order to speak freely , said . \u201c It blows up a lot of the ICE responses to allegations of poor medical care and about how it provides \u2018 the highest care of detainees. \u2019 This makes that seem pretty false , which it is. \u201d An ICE spokesperson told \u2588\u2588\u2588 in a statement it \u201c is committed to ensuring that those in our custody reside in secure , humane environments and under appropriate conditions of confinement . The agency takes very seriously the health , safety and welfare of those in our care , including those who come into ICE custody with prior medical conditions or who have never before received appropriate medical care . It also uses a multi-layered inspections program to ensure its facilities meet a certain threshold of care as outlined in our contracts with facilities , as well as the National Detention Standards and the Performance Based National Detention Standards. \u201d The agency added that it maintains a detainee helpline and created an independent oversight body \u201c to conduct independent oversight of detention conditions for ICE detainees through facility reviews and targeted site visits. \u201d The agency also said senior officials have a council that examines serious issues , especially \u201c critical incidents , \u201d to make sure leadership knows about incidents and \u201c and that all required investigation and coordination is undertaken in a timely fashion. \u201d [ Read ICE \u2019 s full statement here . ] ICE referred \u2588\u2588\u2588 to DHS for questions about investigations into the memo \u2019 s allegations . DHS didn \u2019 t return a request for comment by deadline .\nBettina Hansen / The Seattle Times A detainee receives prescribed medications from an employee at the regional detention center for immigrants in Tacoma , recently renamed the Northwest ICE Processing Center , Sept. 10 .\nICE has expanded the number of people it detains to record levels under Trump . Thousands of immigrants in its custody had passed their initial asylum screenings , a practice that in the past generally led to release from custody .\nThe peak came this summer when around 55,000 immigrants were in custody in local jails and private prisons across the country . To pay for it all , DHS had to transfer money earmarked for disaster relief and other efforts . In recent weeks , it has dipped to around 44,000 people in custody , still above the numbers during the Obama administration . In the 2019 fiscal year , eight people died in ICE custody . The highest number of deaths in recent years came in the 2017 fiscal year , which included the end of the Obama administration , when 12 people died in ICE custody . ICE \u2019 s sprawling detention system relies on a variety of methods to provide medical care . In some facilities , the agency provides it directly ; in others , it has a few ICE employees assist private or public contractors ; and in many , it oversees care provided by a contractor . On Dec. 5 , 2017 , an 8-year-old boy \u2019 s mother told officials at the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley that her son \u2019 s earache had been worsening for two weeks , the memo says . Medical personnel diagnosed him with swimmer \u2019 s ear \u2014 an external ear infection \u2014 and gave him ear drops . More than two weeks later , on Dec. 23 , the boy had seizures and was taken to the hospital . Doctors there diagnosed him with Pott \u2019 s puffy tumor , a rare infection inside the skull that spread from the child \u2019 s ear to his facial bone and formed abscesses under the skull . To treat it , they surgically removed part of the boy \u2019 s frontal bone , which makes up the forehead . The whistleblower said that ICE \u2019 s Medical Quality Management Unit analyzed the case , and found that the \u201c inadequate medical care provided by [ the detention center ] was a contributory factor resulting in harm. \u201d The quality control unit \u2019 s report was forwarded to IHSC leadership who , the whistleblower said , \u201c failed to take appropriate action . ''\n\u201c Allegedly , delayed medical care and misdiagnosis led to an infection that spread from the child \u2019 s ear to his facial bone , requiring a partial bone resection . According to the information provided , on December 5 , 2017 , the child \u2019 s mother first reported that her child had a progressively worsening earache for the past two weeks . The child was subsequently treated using nursing guidelines for Allergies/Fever/Pain , diagnosed with Swimmer \u2019 s Ear , and given ear drops . However , on December 23 , 2017 , the child was noted to have seizure activity and was transferred to the hospital where he was diagnosed with Pott \u2019 s Puffy Tumor with epidural and subdural abscess resulting in partial frontal bone resection . Further , the complainant alleged that MQMU performed an analysis of the case and found that the inadequate medical care provided by STFRC was a contributory factor resulting in harm . MQMU \u2019 s report was forwarded to IHSC leadership and MQMU requested findings and/or interventions from Clinical Services , yet IHSC leadership failed to take appropriate action . \u201d\nAt the Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin , Georgia , a man was \u201c was reportedly bleeding through his skin and having vision changes , \u201d the whistleblower said .\nInstead of taking him to the hospital , a doctor continued his aspirin regimen \u2014 which thins the blood \u2014 for six days \u201c despite [ the detainee ] having extremely thin blood , \u201d the memo reads . The result was \u201c his coughing up large amounts of blood. \u201d He was taken \u201c in critical condition \u201d to the hospital , where he was \u201c not expected to survive. \u201d The quality control unit reviewed the case \u201c and determined that that Asprin therapy may have caused harm that could have resulted in a fatality. \u201d \u201c A delay in care , \u201d the memo reads , \u201c occurred after medical staff were notified of the detainee 's critical lab result that should have resulted in immediate medical intervention. \u201d The quality control unit notified IHSC of \u201c policy and procedure violations , \u201d the memo reads , but \u201c leadership failed to take appropriate action . \u201d\n\u201c Allegedly , a delay in care occurred after medical staff were notified of the detainee \u2019 s critical lab result that should have resulted in immediate medical intervention . [ Name withheld by \u2588\u2588\u2588 ] was reportedly bleeding through his skin and having vision changes . Despite having extremely thin blood , the physician allegedly kept him on aspirin regimen for six days , resulting in his coughing up large amounts of blood . [ Name withheld by \u2588\u2588\u2588 ] was taken to the hospital in critical condition and not expected to survive . MQMU performed an analysis of the case and determined that that Asprin therapy may have caused harm that could have resulted in a fatality . The findings were forwarded to IHSC leadership for consideration of a root cause analysis , yet IHSC leadership failed to take appropriate action . \u201d\nAnd at the Eloy Federal Contract Facility in Arizona , the quality control unit notified the detention center \u2019 s psychiatrist several times about an immigrant \u2019 s \u201c worsening psychosis-related symptoms , but the psychiatrist failed to treat him , \u201d the memo reads .\nThe man \u201c became so unstable that he lacerated his penis , requiring hospitalization and surgery . \u201d\n\u201c According to the complaint , IHSC Medical Quality Management Unit ( \u2018 MQMU \u2019 ) notified the facility psychiatrist several times about [ Name withheld by \u2588\u2588\u2588 ] worsening psychosis-related symptoms , but the psychiatrist failed to treat him . [ Name withheld by \u2588\u2588\u2588 ] allegedly became so unstable that he lacerated his penis , requiring hospitalization and surgery . \u201d\nThe whistleblower referred to the case of Ronald Cruz , whose real name is Ronal Romero .\nRomero came to the US in 2002 and lived for more than a decade in Missouri , where he found a community of friends and worked long hours at local restaurants in management positions , his family told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . In January 2016 , he was convicted of driving under the influence and sentenced to two days in jail . Romero had a previous deportation order , and was picked up by ICE officials and sent back to Honduras .\nRomero returned to the US because of the lack of opportunity and dangerous conditions in his home country , his family said . Romero was arrested by Customs and Border Protection officials on May 9 , 2018 , and was transferred to ICE \u2019 s Port Isabel Detention Center in Los Fresnos , Texas , on May 14 . By the next day , he began feeling sick and was in serious pain , according to a death review conducted by ICE \u2019 s Office of Professional Responsibility and obtained by the Project on Government Oversight . He told the medical staff at the ICE facility that he had been receiving ear drops and antibiotics for an ear infection while he was in CBP custody . He was treated and given medication . But later that day he became confused , not knowing where he was , and had trouble waking up . He died the next day in a hospital . His family did not hear from him while he was in ICE custody , they said , and his death came as a shock : \u201c I cried deeply \u2014 I was like a father and an oldest brother to him , \u201d said one of his brothers , who requested anonymity to speak freely . Their father , the brothers explained , had been murdered years ago in Honduras . An autopsy performed by a private entity found that Cruz died of \u201c sepsis complication with meningitis. \u201d An internal death review conducted by ICE found the facility was compliant with its medical standards . But the whistleblower called the medical care rendered to Cruz `` grossly negligent '' and challenged ICE \u2019 s review , alleging `` that the mortality review committee was erroneous in concluding that the care rendered to Mr. Cruz was appropriate . '' Cruz \u2019 s two older brothers have tried to convince people that the treatment their brother received was substandard . \u201c I \u2019 m grateful to the whistleblower for the strength to share this information in this way \u2014 it \u2019 s very sad what happened with my brother , \u201d one of Cruz \u2019 s siblings told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c We believe he should be here with us . He was our little brother \u2014 he was everything to us . He was treated like an animal. \u201d Andrew Free , an immigration attorney in Georgia who represents Cruz \u2019 s family , said the existence of the memo was illuminating : \u201c To hear an insider who has knowledge of government records saying this was grossly negligent is at once tragic , and oddly validating. \u201d \u201c You should know , \u201d his older brother said , \u201c he was a hard worker who treated others well . He wasn \u2019 t a bad person . He was a good brother and a good friend . \u201d\n\u201c According to the complainant , the medical care rendered to Mr. Cruz was \u2018 grossly negligent. \u2019 Mr. Cruz \u2019 s preliminary cause of death on May 16 , 2018 was ruled as meningitis . The complainant alleged that the mortality review committee was erroneous in concluding that the care rendered to Mr. Cruz was appropriate . \u201d\nThe whistleblower alleged other widespread issues , such as detainees with psychological problems who were allegedly left without observation or provided incorrect medication . Officials were notified about Efrain De La Rosa \u2019 s deteriorating mental health at Stewart Detention Facility in Lumpkin , Georgia . De La Rosa said on April 26 , 2018 , that he \u2019 d be dead in three days \u2014 he killed himself about 11 weeks later .\n\u201c Mr . De La Rosa \u2019 s preliminary cause of death was ruled a suicide . According to the complainant , IHSC leadership was notified of Mr. De La Rosa \u2019 s deteriorating mental health condition via SEN report on several occasions between April 25 , 2018 and May 6 , 2018 . On April 26 , 2018 , a SEN report indicated that while on suicide watch , Mr. De La Rosa \u2019 s had stated to staff that he would be dead in three days . The complainant noted that several months earlier , IHSC leadership directed MQMU to cease reviewing SEN and segregation reports , despite concerns raised to IHSC leadership that this restriction could negatively impact detainee safety . \u201d\nDe La Rosa has been the subject of investigations by the Intercept , the Atlanta Journal-Constitution , and the Young Turks . The Young Turks previously obtained an internal email sent to ICE \u2019 s current acting director , Matthew Albence , that relayed issues with ICE \u2019 s medical care . These outlets reported that De La Rosa was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and was being held in solitary confinement on suicide watch . He seemed obsessed with death . When he was transferred from a mental health facility to Stewart , the staff there didn \u2019 t register his issues . ICE said it is \u201c committed to the health and welfare of all those in its custody and is undertaking a comprehensive agency-wide review of this incident. \u201d One man at Eloy Federal Contract Facility in Arizona was supposed to receive antipsychotic medication \u2014 but allegedly got antidepressants instead , the memo said , \u201c which likely worsened his psychosis. \u201d Senior leadership allegedly told colleagues \u201c to \u2018 hold off \u2019 on notifying IHSC Clinical Services unless and until the detainee became psychotic and suicidal again . ''\n\u201c Allegedly , [ Name withheld by \u2588\u2588\u2588 ] was not treated appropriately for serious mental illness with psychotic-like symptoms . According to the complainant , MQMU warned IHSC senior leadership on two occasions about [ Name withheld by \u2588\u2588\u2588 ] increased risk of adverse outcomes due to his auditory hallucinations and suicidal ideations . This allegedly resulted in [ Name withheld by \u2588\u2588\u2588 ] not receiving anti-psychotic medication , despite the IHSC chief psychiatrist \u2019 s agreement with the MQMU \u2019 s findings and recommendation that [ Name withheld by \u2588\u2588\u2588 ] receive anti-psychotic medication . Instead , [ Name withheld by \u2588\u2588\u2588 ] received an anti-depressant which likely worsened his psychosis . The complainant further claimed that following MQMU \u2019 s second notification of inadequate mental health care and treatment , IHSC senior leadership allegedly advised MQMU to \u2018 hold off \u2019 on notifying IHSC Clinical Services unless and until the detainee became psychotic and suicidal again . \u201d\nFour cases alleged forcible medication at two facilities : the El Paso Service Processing Center in Texas and the Jena/LaSalle Detention Facility in Louisiana . In these cases , the memo was concerned with \u201c policy and procedure violations \u201d around the injections . And each time , the memo said , \u201c IHSC leadership failed to take appropriate action . '' Both cases in Louisiana involved forced injections of Ativan , a medication that aims to treat patients with mental illness and agitation . There , a woman was sent to the hospital for erratic behavior and convulsions . When she returned , she was found eating toilet paper and Styrofoam . She was allegedly \u201c given forced intramuscular injection of Ativan . \u201d\n\u201c [ Name withheld by \u2588\u2588\u2588 ] was sent to the hospital Emergency Room due to erratic behavior and convulsions . When she returned to the facility , she was observed eating toilet paper and styrofoam in the Medical Housing Unit ( MHU ) . According to the complainant , [ Name withheld by \u2588\u2588\u2588 ] was placed at higher than normal risk for mental status deterioration and given forced intramuscular injection of Ativan . Further , the complainant alleged that MQMU performed an analysis of the case and the findings included policy and procedure violations , which were forwarded to IHSC leadership for review and action , yet IHSC leadership failed to take appropriate action . \u201d\n\u201c Allegedly , [ Name withheld by \u2588\u2588\u2588 ] was forcibly medicated with multiple Ativan injections for repeated behavioral issues . Further , MQMU performed an analysis of the case and the findings included policy and procedure violations , which were forwarded to IHSC leadership for review and action , yet IHSC leadership dialed to take appropriate action . \u201d\n\u201c According to the information provided , [ Name withheld by \u2588\u2588\u2588 ] was observed with a sweatshirt around his neck and four correctional officers held him down while medical staff administered a haloperidol intramuscularly by force . According to the complainant , MQMU performed an analysis of the case and the findings included policy and procedure violations , which were forwarded to IHSC leadership for review and action , yet , IHSC leadership failed to take appropriate action . \u201d\n\u201c Allegedly , [ Name withheld by \u2588\u2588\u2588 ] was forcibly medicated for reported behavioral issues . MQMU performed an analysis of the case and the findings included policy and procedure violations , which were forwarded to IHSC leadership for review and action , yet IHSC leadership failed to take appropriate action . \u201d\nIn at least four cases , detainees were allegedly not appropriately treated for their alcohol or opioid withdrawal .\n\u201c Allegedly , facility medical staff did not follow policies and procedures concerning withdrawal protocols for [ Name withheld by \u2588\u2588\u2588 ] alcohol withdrawal . [ Name withheld by \u2588\u2588\u2588 ] a stated during his intake screening that he consumed one bottle of vodka and two bottles of beer daily . [ Name withheld by \u2588\u2588\u2588 ] subsequently went into severe alcohol withdrawal and delirium and was admitted to the hospital in the intensive care unit ( ICU ) . Further , according to the complainant , MQMU performed an analysis of the case and the findings included policy and procedure violations , which were forwarded to IHSC leadership for review and action , yet IHSC leadership failed to take appropriate action .\n\u201c Allegedly , facility medical staff did not follow policies and procedures concerning withdrawal protocols for [ Name withheld by \u2588\u2588\u2588 ] opioid withdrawal . According to the complainant , the detainee was not treated until MQMU staff called the facility following a review of a significant event notification ( SEN ) . The detainee was subsequently found to be in severe benzodiazepine withdrawal and was admitted to the hospital . Further , the complainant alleges that MQMU performed an analysis of the case and the findings included policy and procedure violations , which were forwarded to IHSC leadership for review and action , yet IHSC leadership failed to take appropriate action . \u201d\n\u201c Allegedly , facility medical staff did not follow policies and procedures concerning withdrawal protocols for [ Name withheld by \u2588\u2588\u2588 ] benzodiazepines withdrawal . According to the complainant , medical staff did not address his withdrawal at intake , despite his reporting high levels of daily consumption of benzodiazepines . [ Name withheld by \u2588\u2588\u2588 ] subsequently went into drug withdrawal seizures and was admitted to the hospital . Further , the complainant alleges that MQMU performed an analysis of the case and the findings included policy and procedure violations , which were forwarded to IHSC leadership for review and action , yet IHSC leadership failed to take appropriate action. \u201d \u201c Allegedly , facility medical staff did not follow policies and procedures concerning withdrawal protocols for [ Name withheld by \u2588\u2588\u2588 ] opioid withdrawal , and a medication error occurred during the course of his treatment . Further , according to the complainant , MQMU performed an analysis of the case and the findings included policy and procedure violations , which were forwarded to the IHSC leadership for review and action , yet IHSC leadership failed to take appropriate action . \u201d\nAnd Roger Rayson died in ICE custody at the LaSalle Detention Facility of bleeding in the brain . The whistleblower described the care provided to him as \u201c deplorable . \u201d\n\u201c According to the complainant , Mr. Rayson healthcare was \u2018 deplorable. \u2019 Mr. Rayson \u2019 s preliminary cause of death was ruled as subdural hemorrhages resulting in a traumatic brain injury . The complainant claimed that multiple requests for the Uniform Corrective Action Plan ( UCAP ) and Root Cause Analysis ( RCA ) were made to IHSC leadership , but IHSC did not respond . \u201d\nRayson , a 47-year-old Jamaican immigrant , died approximately two months after being taken into ICE custody and a month \u201c after being transferred to a hospital for nausea , vomiting , and pain , \u201d according to a report by four advocacy groups . At the hospital , the report said he was diagnosed with \u201c a fast-growing but treatable form of non-Hodgkin \u2019 s Lymphoma , and died nine days later . \u201d\nMedical experts interviewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588 said the series of allegations required additional scrutiny , including from Congress . \u201c The allegations , if they are true , are serious and deserve really careful scrutiny about what went wrong , why it went wrong , and it is very possible they represent a more fundamental problem with the ICE health care system , \u201d said Marc Stern , a public health expert and faculty member at the University of Washington . Homer Venters , a former chief medical officer for the New York City jail system who has closely studied care in correctional facilities , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 he was concerned that \u201c IHSC is not acting in a way to not repeat the same type of preventable death over and over in different places around the country. \u201d Venters said that , in his experience , when health professionals such as the whistleblower take their complaints outside of their own system , \u201c they do so because they don \u2019 t see a path to improving the system from the inside \u2014 they don \u2019 t see hope for addressing what are detention-related deaths that are preventable that flow from lack of access to quality health services . \u201d\nEric Gay / AP A box for grievances is seen in the cafeteria at the ICE South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley , Texas , Aug. 23 .\nICE has been criticized for its detainee medical care for years . In 2019 alone , the family of an Iranian man who the ACLU claims failed to receive proper treatment for methadone withdrawal and later died in ICE custody in Colorado sued the private prison contractor he was held in , GEO Group . In August , immigrant advocates sued ICE on behalf of 15 individuals detained at 8 different facilities in 6 states over what they described as the federal government \u2019 s failure to provide adequate medical and mental health treatment . The groups allege that the detainees have been denied necessary surgeries or even provided medication , such as insulin , for serious medical issues . ICE officials have long said that they are dedicated to providing timely and comprehensive medical care to immigrants in their custody , noting that they have access to a daily sick call and 24-hour emergency care . The agency has publicized that it spends more than $ 269 million each year on health care services . The former senior ICE official told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that some at the agency brush away allegations of substandard medical care . \u201c \u2018 The care is better than they got in their home countries \u2019 \u2014 you hear that a lot , \u201d the former official said . The official said it was unlikely that the agency would dramatically alter or add resources to its medical care system . \u201c It \u2019 s not going to happen under this administration , \u201d the former official said . \u201c That would take away money from beds and they are high on beds . They are not going to want to use that money in a different way. \u201d \u25cf\nA Child \u2019 s Forehead Partially Removed Four Deaths The Wrong Medicine A Secret Report Exposes Health Care For Jailed Immigrants \u2588\u2588\u2588 has obtained a memo in which an ICE whistleblower says two immigrants got preventable surgeries and two were given the wrong drugs .

Four died \u2014 one after getting \"grossly negligent\" care.\n\nImmigrants held in Immigration and Customs Enforcement jails around the US received medical care so bad it resulted in two preventable surgeries, including an 8-year-old boy who had to have part of his forehead removed, and contributed to four deaths, according to an internal complaint from an agency whistleblower. The allegations appear in an explosive Department of Homeland Security memo, obtained by BuzzFeed News, containing reports of detainees being given incorrect medication, suffering from delays in treating withdrawal symptoms, and one who was allowed to become so mentally unstable he lacerated his own penis and required reparative surgery.\n\nTo read the full DHS memo, click here.\n\nThe whistleblower reported that three people had died in ICE lockup after receiving inadequate medical treatment or oversight, and said official reports on a fourth person\u2019s death were \u201cvery misleading.\u201d One man died from meningitis following \u201cgrossly negligent\u201d care. Another killed himself after saying he would do exactly that months earlier. The allegations were laid out in a March 20 memorandum signed by Cameron Quinn, DHS\u2019s officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, and sent to top ICE leadership. The memo describes the whistleblower as someone within the ICE Health Service Corps, or IHSC, which provides medical care and oversight for detainees in the agency\u2019s custody. BuzzFeed News does not know the person\u2019s identity. The whistleblower\u2019s allegations were first received by the Homeland Security\u2019s inspector general in April 2018. In July of that year, the inspector general sent the allegations to Quinn\u2019s office, which will investigate the medical care and oversight IHSC provides at a time when President Donald Trump demonizes immigrants, detains them in record numbers, and enacts restrictive policies to keep them out of the US. The allegations in the DHS memo, if corroborated, are a cry from someone working for ICE echoing what advocates, lawsuits, and other media reports have been saying for years: The medical care ICE provides and oversees for immigrants in private and local jails could be very bad. This internal memo is one of a trove of remarkable secret documents \u2014 including emails, briefing materials, and draft reports \u2014 BuzzFeed News has obtained throughout 2019 uncovering how the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies were formed and executed, and how those policies confused or harmed people who sought to immigrate to the US. These records have revealed how immigrants locked up at the US border had no access to showers and how children were held in closed and crowded cells; that US border officials apparently pressured the asylum office to deny immigrants entry into the US; that a Texas detention center waited more than seven hours to transfer an ailing 37-year-old Mexican man to a hospital, where he died from bleeding in his brain; and that in the final days before launching a controversial plan to deport Central American asylum-seekers to Guatemala, US officials scrambled to answer basic questions such as how people would get shelter, food, and social services. BuzzFeed News has retyped the memo based on the whistleblower\u2019s allegations, providing its full text, because metadata or other information in the original could compromise a source\u2019s identity. BuzzFeed News redacted the names of most immigrants and ICE middle managers and their contact information. [Make more work like this possible: Become a BuzzFeed News member today.] The memo describes what happened to 17 different immigrants who were held at nine facilities across six states, from Georgia to Washington. The allegations include: That immigrants received incorrect medications. One man was given an antidepressant instead of an antipsychotic drug, likely worsening his condition. Another was given aspirin despite having thin blood \u2014 he nearly died.\n\nThat four immigrants endured severe withdrawal symptoms while in ICE custody. One man addicted to opioids was the subject of a \u201cmedication error\u201d; two men with a benzodiazepine addiction saw delays in treatment; and one man \u201cwent into severe alcohol withdrawal and delirium and was admitted to the hospital in the intensive care unit.\u201d\n\nThat IHSC leadership was unresponsive or even dishonest when confronted. They \u201cfailed to take appropriate action\u201d when told of policy violations in 10 of the cases; \u201cdid not respond\u201d to concerns about one case in which a detainee with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma died under \u201cdeplorable\u201d conditions; and were \u201cerroneous\u201d and told others to \u201chold off\u201d when looking into several cases. Overall, the memo says, the whistleblower alleged that IHSC \u201chas systematically provided inadequate medical and mental health care and oversight to immigration detainees across the U.S.\u201d The memo also says the inspector general will investigate the whistleblower\u2019s allegation that they were retaliated against for raising the issues.\n\nThe memo was distributed within the agency \u2014 but a former senior ICE official who was aware of the allegations and the response told BuzzFeed News that ICE leadership appeared to not take a close look at the allegations. \u201cThis is significant and very damning,\u201d the former official, who requested anonymity in order to speak freely, said. \u201cIt blows up a lot of the ICE responses to allegations of poor medical care and about how it provides \u2018the highest care of detainees.\u2019 This makes that seem pretty false, which it is.\u201d An ICE spokesperson told BuzzFeed News in a statement it \u201cis committed to ensuring that those in our custody reside in secure, humane environments and under appropriate conditions of confinement. The agency takes very seriously the health, safety and welfare of those in our care, including those who come into ICE custody with prior medical conditions or who have never before received appropriate medical care. It also uses a multi-layered inspections program to ensure its facilities meet a certain threshold of care as outlined in our contracts with facilities, as well as the National Detention Standards and the Performance Based National Detention Standards.\u201d The agency added that it maintains a detainee helpline and created an independent oversight body \u201cto conduct independent oversight of detention conditions for ICE detainees through facility reviews and targeted site visits.\u201d The agency also said senior officials have a council that examines serious issues, especially \u201ccritical incidents,\u201d to make sure leadership knows about incidents and \u201cand that all required investigation and coordination is undertaken in a timely fashion.\u201d [Read ICE\u2019s full statement here.] ICE referred BuzzFeed News to DHS for questions about investigations into the memo\u2019s allegations. DHS didn\u2019t return a request for comment by deadline.\n\nBettina Hansen / The Seattle Times A detainee receives prescribed medications from an employee at the regional detention center for immigrants in Tacoma, recently renamed the Northwest ICE Processing Center, Sept. 10.\n\nICE has expanded the number of people it detains to record levels under Trump. Thousands of immigrants in its custody had passed their initial asylum screenings, a practice that in the past generally led to release from custody.\n\nThe peak came this summer when around 55,000 immigrants were in custody in local jails and private prisons across the country. To pay for it all, DHS had to transfer money earmarked for disaster relief and other efforts. In recent weeks, it has dipped to around 44,000 people in custody, still above the numbers during the Obama administration. In the 2019 fiscal year, eight people died in ICE custody. The highest number of deaths in recent years came in the 2017 fiscal year, which included the end of the Obama administration, when 12 people died in ICE custody. ICE\u2019s sprawling detention system relies on a variety of methods to provide medical care. In some facilities, the agency provides it directly; in others, it has a few ICE employees assist private or public contractors; and in many, it oversees care provided by a contractor. On Dec. 5, 2017, an 8-year-old boy\u2019s mother told officials at the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley that her son\u2019s earache had been worsening for two weeks, the memo says. Medical personnel diagnosed him with swimmer\u2019s ear \u2014 an external ear infection \u2014 and gave him ear drops. More than two weeks later, on Dec. 23, the boy had seizures and was taken to the hospital. Doctors there diagnosed him with Pott\u2019s puffy tumor, a rare infection inside the skull that spread from the child\u2019s ear to his facial bone and formed abscesses under the skull. To treat it, they surgically removed part of the boy\u2019s frontal bone, which makes up the forehead. The whistleblower said that ICE\u2019s Medical Quality Management Unit analyzed the case, and found that the \u201cinadequate medical care provided by [the detention center] was a contributory factor resulting in harm.\u201d The quality control unit\u2019s report was forwarded to IHSC leadership who, the whistleblower said, \u201cfailed to take appropriate action.\"\n\n\u201cAllegedly, delayed medical care and misdiagnosis led to an infection that spread from the child\u2019s ear to his facial bone, requiring a partial bone resection. According to the information provided, on December 5, 2017, the child\u2019s mother first reported that her child had a progressively worsening earache for the past two weeks. The child was subsequently treated using nursing guidelines for Allergies/Fever/Pain, diagnosed with Swimmer\u2019s Ear, and given ear drops. However, on December 23, 2017, the child was noted to have seizure activity and was transferred to the hospital where he was diagnosed with Pott\u2019s Puffy Tumor with epidural and subdural abscess resulting in partial frontal bone resection. Further, the complainant alleged that MQMU performed an analysis of the case and found that the inadequate medical care provided by STFRC was a contributory factor resulting in harm. MQMU\u2019s report was forwarded to IHSC leadership and MQMU requested findings and/or interventions from Clinical Services, yet IHSC leadership failed to take appropriate action.\u201d\n\nAt the Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia, a man was \u201cwas reportedly bleeding through his skin and having vision changes,\u201d the whistleblower said.\n\nInstead of taking him to the hospital, a doctor continued his aspirin regimen \u2014 which thins the blood \u2014 for six days \u201cdespite [the detainee] having extremely thin blood,\u201d the memo reads. The result was \u201chis coughing up large amounts of blood.\u201d He was taken \u201cin critical condition\u201d to the hospital, where he was \u201cnot expected to survive.\u201d The quality control unit reviewed the case \u201cand determined that that Asprin therapy may have caused harm that could have resulted in a fatality.\u201d \u201cA delay in care,\u201d the memo reads, \u201coccurred after medical staff were notified of the detainee's critical lab result that should have resulted in immediate medical intervention.\u201d The quality control unit notified IHSC of \u201cpolicy and procedure violations,\u201d the memo reads, but \u201cleadership failed to take appropriate action.\u201d\n\n\u201cAllegedly, a delay in care occurred after medical staff were notified of the detainee\u2019s critical lab result that should have resulted in immediate medical intervention. [Name withheld by BuzzFeed News] was reportedly bleeding through his skin and having vision changes. Despite having extremely thin blood, the physician allegedly kept him on aspirin regimen for six days, resulting in his coughing up large amounts of blood. [Name withheld by BuzzFeed News] was taken to the hospital in critical condition and not expected to survive. MQMU performed an analysis of the case and determined that that Asprin therapy may have caused harm that could have resulted in a fatality. The findings were forwarded to IHSC leadership for consideration of a root cause analysis, yet IHSC leadership failed to take appropriate action.\u201d\n\nAnd at the Eloy Federal Contract Facility in Arizona, the quality control unit notified the detention center\u2019s psychiatrist several times about an immigrant\u2019s \u201cworsening psychosis-related symptoms, but the psychiatrist failed to treat him,\u201d the memo reads.\n\nThe man \u201cbecame so unstable that he lacerated his penis, requiring hospitalization and surgery.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to the complaint, IHSC Medical Quality Management Unit (\u2018MQMU\u2019) notified the facility psychiatrist several times about [Name withheld by BuzzFeed News] worsening psychosis-related symptoms, but the psychiatrist failed to treat him. [Name withheld by BuzzFeed News] allegedly became so unstable that he lacerated his penis, requiring hospitalization and surgery.\u201d\n\nJose Cabezas / Getty Images A detainee rests at the infirmary of Port Isabel Detention Center in Texas.\n\nThe whistleblower referred to the case of Ronald Cruz, whose real name is Ronal Romero.\n\nRomero came to the US in 2002 and lived for more than a decade in Missouri, where he found a community of friends and worked long hours at local restaurants in management positions, his family told BuzzFeed News. In January 2016, he was convicted of driving under the influence and sentenced to two days in jail. Romero had a previous deportation order, and was picked up by ICE officials and sent back to Honduras.\n\nCourtesy Francisco Romero family Ronal Romero\n\nRomero returned to the US because of the lack of opportunity and dangerous conditions in his home country, his family said. Romero was arrested by Customs and Border Protection officials on May 9, 2018, and was transferred to ICE\u2019s Port Isabel Detention Center in Los Fresnos, Texas, on May 14. By the next day, he began feeling sick and was in serious pain, according to a death review conducted by ICE\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility and obtained by the Project on Government Oversight. He told the medical staff at the ICE facility that he had been receiving ear drops and antibiotics for an ear infection while he was in CBP custody. He was treated and given medication. But later that day he became confused, not knowing where he was, and had trouble waking up. He died the next day in a hospital. His family did not hear from him while he was in ICE custody, they said, and his death came as a shock: \u201cI cried deeply \u2014 I was like a father and an oldest brother to him,\u201d said one of his brothers, who requested anonymity to speak freely. Their father, the brothers explained, had been murdered years ago in Honduras. An autopsy performed by a private entity found that Cruz died of \u201csepsis complication with meningitis.\u201d An internal death review conducted by ICE found the facility was compliant with its medical standards. But the whistleblower called the medical care rendered to Cruz \"grossly negligent\" and challenged ICE\u2019s review, alleging \"that the mortality review committee was erroneous in concluding that the care rendered to Mr. Cruz was appropriate.\" Cruz\u2019s two older brothers have tried to convince people that the treatment their brother received was substandard. \u201cI\u2019m grateful to the whistleblower for the strength to share this information in this way \u2014 it\u2019s very sad what happened with my brother,\u201d one of Cruz\u2019s siblings told BuzzFeed News. \u201cWe believe he should be here with us. He was our little brother \u2014 he was everything to us. He was treated like an animal.\u201d Andrew Free, an immigration attorney in Georgia who represents Cruz\u2019s family, said the existence of the memo was illuminating: \u201cTo hear an insider who has knowledge of government records saying this was grossly negligent is at once tragic, and oddly validating.\u201d \u201cYou should know,\u201d his older brother said, \u201che was a hard worker who treated others well. He wasn\u2019t a bad person. He was a good brother and a good friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to the complainant, the medical care rendered to Mr. Cruz was \u2018grossly negligent.\u2019 Mr. Cruz\u2019s preliminary cause of death on May 16, 2018 was ruled as meningitis. The complainant alleged that the mortality review committee was erroneous in concluding that the care rendered to Mr. Cruz was appropriate.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower alleged other widespread issues, such as detainees with psychological problems who were allegedly left without observation or provided incorrect medication. Officials were notified about Efrain De La Rosa\u2019s deteriorating mental health at Stewart Detention Facility in Lumpkin, Georgia. De La Rosa said on April 26, 2018, that he\u2019d be dead in three days \u2014 he killed himself about 11 weeks later.\n\n\u201cMr. De La Rosa\u2019s preliminary cause of death was ruled a suicide. According to the complainant, IHSC leadership was notified of Mr. De La Rosa\u2019s deteriorating mental health condition via SEN report on several occasions between April 25, 2018 and May 6, 2018. On April 26, 2018, a SEN report indicated that while on suicide watch, Mr. De La Rosa\u2019s had stated to staff that he would be dead in three days. The complainant noted that several months earlier, IHSC leadership directed MQMU to cease reviewing SEN and segregation reports, despite concerns raised to IHSC leadership that this restriction could negatively impact detainee safety.\u201d\n\nDe La Rosa has been the subject of investigations by the Intercept, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, and the Young Turks. The Young Turks previously obtained an internal email sent to ICE\u2019s current acting director, Matthew Albence, that relayed issues with ICE\u2019s medical care. These outlets reported that De La Rosa was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and was being held in solitary confinement on suicide watch. He seemed obsessed with death. When he was transferred from a mental health facility to Stewart, the staff there didn\u2019t register his issues. ICE said it is \u201ccommitted to the health and welfare of all those in its custody and is undertaking a comprehensive agency-wide review of this incident.\u201d One man at Eloy Federal Contract Facility in Arizona was supposed to receive antipsychotic medication \u2014 but allegedly got antidepressants instead, the memo said, \u201cwhich likely worsened his psychosis.\u201d Senior leadership allegedly told colleagues \u201cto \u2018hold off\u2019 on notifying IHSC Clinical Services unless and until the detainee became psychotic and suicidal again.\"\n\n\u201cAllegedly, [Name withheld by BuzzFeed News] was not treated appropriately for serious mental illness with psychotic-like symptoms. According to the complainant, MQMU warned IHSC senior leadership on two occasions about [Name withheld by BuzzFeed News] increased risk of adverse outcomes due to his auditory hallucinations and suicidal ideations. This allegedly resulted in [Name withheld by BuzzFeed News] not receiving anti-psychotic medication, despite the IHSC chief psychiatrist\u2019s agreement with the MQMU\u2019s findings and recommendation that [Name withheld by BuzzFeed News] receive anti-psychotic medication. Instead, [Name withheld by BuzzFeed News] received an anti-depressant which likely worsened his psychosis. The complainant further claimed that following MQMU\u2019s second notification of inadequate mental health care and treatment, IHSC senior leadership allegedly advised MQMU to \u2018hold off\u2019 on notifying IHSC Clinical Services unless and until the detainee became psychotic and suicidal again.\u201d\n\nFour cases alleged forcible medication at two facilities: the El Paso Service Processing Center in Texas and the Jena/LaSalle Detention Facility in Louisiana. In these cases, the memo was concerned with \u201cpolicy and procedure violations\u201d around the injections. And each time, the memo said, \u201cIHSC leadership failed to take appropriate action.\" Both cases in Louisiana involved forced injections of Ativan, a medication that aims to treat patients with mental illness and agitation. There, a woman was sent to the hospital for erratic behavior and convulsions. When she returned, she was found eating toilet paper and Styrofoam. She was allegedly \u201cgiven forced intramuscular injection of Ativan.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Name withheld by BuzzFeed News] was sent to the hospital Emergency Room due to erratic behavior and convulsions. When she returned to the facility, she was observed eating toilet paper and styrofoam in the Medical Housing Unit (MHU). According to the complainant, [Name withheld by BuzzFeed News] was placed at higher than normal risk for mental status deterioration and given forced intramuscular injection of Ativan. Further, the complainant alleged that MQMU performed an analysis of the case and the findings included policy and procedure violations, which were forwarded to IHSC leadership for review and action, yet IHSC leadership failed to take appropriate action.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAllegedly, [Name withheld by BuzzFeed News] was forcibly medicated with multiple Ativan injections for repeated behavioral issues. Further, MQMU performed an analysis of the case and the findings included policy and procedure violations, which were forwarded to IHSC leadership for review and action, yet IHSC leadership dialed to take appropriate action.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAccording to the information provided, [Name withheld by BuzzFeed News] was observed with a sweatshirt around his neck and four correctional officers held him down while medical staff administered a haloperidol intramuscularly by force. According to the complainant, MQMU performed an analysis of the case and the findings included policy and procedure violations, which were forwarded to IHSC leadership for review and action, yet, IHSC leadership failed to take appropriate action.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAllegedly, [Name withheld by BuzzFeed News] was forcibly medicated for reported behavioral issues. MQMU performed an analysis of the case and the findings included policy and procedure violations, which were forwarded to IHSC leadership for review and action, yet IHSC leadership failed to take appropriate action.\u201d\n\nIn at least four cases, detainees were allegedly not appropriately treated for their alcohol or opioid withdrawal.\n\n\u201cAllegedly, facility medical staff did not follow policies and procedures concerning withdrawal protocols for [Name withheld by BuzzFeed News] alcohol withdrawal. [Name withheld by BuzzFeed News] a stated during his intake screening that he consumed one bottle of vodka and two bottles of beer daily. [Name withheld by BuzzFeed News] subsequently went into severe alcohol withdrawal and delirium and was admitted to the hospital in the intensive care unit (ICU). Further, according to the complainant, MQMU performed an analysis of the case and the findings included policy and procedure violations, which were forwarded to IHSC leadership for review and action, yet IHSC leadership failed to take appropriate action.\n\n\n\n\u201cAllegedly, facility medical staff did not follow policies and procedures concerning withdrawal protocols for [Name withheld by BuzzFeed News] opioid withdrawal. According to the complainant, the detainee was not treated until MQMU staff called the facility following a review of a significant event notification (SEN). The detainee was subsequently found to be in severe benzodiazepine withdrawal and was admitted to the hospital. Further, the complainant alleges that MQMU performed an analysis of the case and the findings included policy and procedure violations, which were forwarded to IHSC leadership for review and action, yet IHSC leadership failed to take appropriate action.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cAllegedly, facility medical staff did not follow policies and procedures concerning withdrawal protocols for [Name withheld by BuzzFeed News] benzodiazepines withdrawal. According to the complainant, medical staff did not address his withdrawal at intake, despite his reporting high levels of daily consumption of benzodiazepines. [Name withheld by BuzzFeed News] subsequently went into drug withdrawal seizures and was admitted to the hospital. Further, the complainant alleges that MQMU performed an analysis of the case and the findings included policy and procedure violations, which were forwarded to IHSC leadership for review and action, yet IHSC leadership failed to take appropriate action.\u201d \u201cAllegedly, facility medical staff did not follow policies and procedures concerning withdrawal protocols for [Name withheld by BuzzFeed News] opioid withdrawal, and a medication error occurred during the course of his treatment. Further, according to the complainant, MQMU performed an analysis of the case and the findings included policy and procedure violations, which were forwarded to the IHSC leadership for review and action, yet IHSC leadership failed to take appropriate action.\u201d\n\nAnd Roger Rayson died in ICE custody at the LaSalle Detention Facility of bleeding in the brain. The whistleblower described the care provided to him as \u201cdeplorable.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to the complainant, Mr. Rayson healthcare was \u2018deplorable.\u2019 Mr. Rayson\u2019s preliminary cause of death was ruled as subdural hemorrhages resulting in a traumatic brain injury. The complainant claimed that multiple requests for the Uniform Corrective Action Plan (UCAP) and Root Cause Analysis (RCA) were made to IHSC leadership, but IHSC did not respond.\u201d\n\nRayson, a 47-year-old Jamaican immigrant, died approximately two months after being taken into ICE custody and a month \u201cafter being transferred to a hospital for nausea, vomiting, and pain,\u201d according to a report by four advocacy groups. At the hospital, the report said he was diagnosed with \u201ca fast-growing but treatable form of non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma, and died nine days later.\u201d\n\nMedical experts interviewed by BuzzFeed News said the series of allegations required additional scrutiny, including from Congress. \u201cThe allegations, if they are true, are serious and deserve really careful scrutiny about what went wrong, why it went wrong, and it is very possible they represent a more fundamental problem with the ICE health care system,\u201d said Marc Stern, a public health expert and faculty member at the University of Washington. Homer Venters, a former chief medical officer for the New York City jail system who has closely studied care in correctional facilities, told BuzzFeed News he was concerned that \u201cIHSC is not acting in a way to not repeat the same type of preventable death over and over in different places around the country.\u201d Venters said that, in his experience, when health professionals such as the whistleblower take their complaints outside of their own system, \u201cthey do so because they don\u2019t see a path to improving the system from the inside \u2014 they don\u2019t see hope for addressing what are detention-related deaths that are preventable that flow from lack of access to quality health services.\u201d\n\nEric Gay / AP A box for grievances is seen in the cafeteria at the ICE South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas, Aug. 23.\n\nICE has been criticized for its detainee medical care for years. In 2019 alone, the family of an Iranian man who the ACLU claims failed to receive proper treatment for methadone withdrawal and later died in ICE custody in Colorado sued the private prison contractor he was held in, GEO Group. In August, immigrant advocates sued ICE on behalf of 15 individuals detained at 8 different facilities in 6 states over what they described as the federal government\u2019s failure to provide adequate medical and mental health treatment. The groups allege that the detainees have been denied necessary surgeries or even provided medication, such as insulin, for serious medical issues. ICE officials have long said that they are dedicated to providing timely and comprehensive medical care to immigrants in their custody, noting that they have access to a daily sick call and 24-hour emergency care. The agency has publicized that it spends more than $269 million each year on health care services. The former senior ICE official told BuzzFeed News that some at the agency brush away allegations of substandard medical care. \u201c\u2018The care is better than they got in their home countries\u2019 \u2014 you hear that a lot,\u201d the former official said. The official said it was unlikely that the agency would dramatically alter or add resources to its medical care system. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen under this administration,\u201d the former official said. \u201cThat would take away money from beds and they are high on beds. They are not going to want to use that money in a different way.\u201d \u25cf\n\nA Child\u2019s Forehead Partially Removed Four Deaths The Wrong Medicine A Secret Report Exposes Health Care For Jailed Immigrants BuzzFeed News has obtained a memo in which an ICE whistleblower says two immigrants got preventable surgeries and two were given the wrong drugs.
