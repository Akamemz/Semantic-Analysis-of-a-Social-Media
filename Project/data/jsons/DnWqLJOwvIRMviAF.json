    "content": "Administration officials have been so impressed by Nancy Pelosi \u2019 s approach to negotiations over giving President Barack Obama \u201c fast-track \u201d trade authority that they \u2019 ve started to consider a crazy possibility : She could even vote for it herself .\nAs the liberal leader of a progressive caucus , the House minority leader doesn \u2019 t really like fast track , which means Congress couldn \u2019 t amend the terms of Obama \u2019 s Pacific trade deal . She voted against it when it came up in 2002 . She has serious policy concerns about both Trade Promotion Authority , as it \u2019 s known , and the treaty called the Trans-Pacific Partnership .\nThat \u2019 s put her in a tight spot . She doesn \u2019 t want her president to be embarrassed by failing to get an authority granted to his predecessors . But congressional sources close to Pelosi say she \u2019 s peeved that her members are being asked to take such a tough vote on trade when Republicans \u2014 the party that has historically carried trade votes \u2014 have one of their biggest majorities in history .\nMembers are left trying to read between the lines of what she \u2019 s said in public and private , that she \u2019 s trying to find a path to yes but is full of frustrations about the process and the terms .\nIn the Senate , Minority Leader Harry Reid ( D-Nev. ) voted no and washed his hands of the effort , except for suggesting an idea that would have upended the timing . Pelosi \u2019 s approach has been the opposite : Obama aides say they don \u2019 t know how Pelosi will vote in the end , but they gush about how hands-on she \u2019 s been , how accommodating she \u2019 s been in letting them make their case , how critical she \u2019 s been in saying nothing about her position to give her fellow Democrats cover to get to yes .\n\u201c I applaud the leader for creating enough space to really evaluate this legislation , \u201d said Rep. Ami Bera ( D-Calif. ) , who announced his support for TPA last month and has become the anti-TPA effort \u2019 s top target to scare others into voting no . \u201c She \u2019 s done a good job creating that space . \u201d\nThere \u2019 s the noise about the TPA vote : two dozen publicly undecided Democrats , labor unions threatening Bera and other Democratic yes votes , Obama going around in person and on television to rally support . Then there \u2019 s the reality : If fast track is going to pass the House , Speaker John Boehner ( R-Ohio ) is going to need to keep Republican defections limited to about 50 , Democrats are going to have to make up the rest of the majority and it will pass with the bare minimum of votes .\nThe White House hopes Pelosi \u2019 s going to put her thumb on the backs of however many necks she needs , forcing yes votes among the more reluctant but safe members , letting the more endangered members off the hook , finding votes and trading votes until she gets to the 24 , or 25 , or 26 that she needs .\nShe did it with Obamacare . She \u2019 s done it at other key moments when Obama \u2019 s agenda \u2019 s been on the line . Now the White House is counting on her to do it again .\n\u201c If this is going to pass , Pelosi wants to minimize member impact and not have any single member walk the plank so that a House Republican doesn \u2019 t have to , \u201d said one person close to the minority leader .\n\u201c She is caught between a caucus that naturally gravitates toward no and the White House , and loyalty to a White House that is expecting her to get to yes . Her position is that she wants to get to yes and she is talking about this almost on a daily basis , \u201d said a senior House Democrat . \u201c She is going to figure it out when we are in the last two minutes where she will be . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s more than just not saying anything .
