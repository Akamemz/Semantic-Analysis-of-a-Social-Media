    "content": "( CNN ) Saturday was a big day for Bernie Sanders ' quest for the Democratic presidential nomination as he swept to resounding victories in the caucus states of Hawaii , Washington and Alaska . But the delegate math is still in Hillary Clinton 's favor .\n`` We knew things were going to improve as we headed West , '' Sanders said at a jubilant rally before 8,000 people in Madison , Wisconsin -- a state that will hold the next major contest in 10 days . `` We have a path toward victory . ''\nClinton built up her delegate lead on the back of a strong run in the South , and Sanders argued Saturday his campaign always knew those states would be tough . In Madison , he said the map now offers more opportunities for his campaign as the contest progressed , largely because his wins are being powered by huge turnout among younger voters .\n`` With your help we 're going to win right here in Wisconsin , '' he said . `` So do n't let anyone tell you we ca n't win the nomination , or win the general election . We 're going to do both of those things . ''\nBut even with his big victories on Saturday , Sanders faces steep hurdles in catching Clinton in the delegate count . While Washington had 101 delegates up for grabs , and both candidates spent a significant amount of time there , Hawaii and Alaska were relatively small prizes -- with just 25 and 16 delegates at stake respectively .\nClinton 's campaign privately acknowledged that Saturday would be a good one for Sanders , and her efforts in Washington were aimed mostly at trying to keep the race relatively close , as delegates are distributed proportionally . But with over 90 % delegates accounted for , Sanders held a wide lead over Clinton in Washington , 72 % to 28 % . Alaska was more lopsided : Sanders won 80 % to 20 % .\nJUST WATCHED Bird lands on podium ; crowd erupts Replay More Videos ...

She also faces favorable territory in the upcoming Super Tuesday contest on April 26 when Pennsylvania , Connecticut , Delaware , Rhode Island and Maryland voters head to the polls and nearly 400 pledged delegates are at stake .\nWhile Sanders shaved Clinton 's lead in the delegate count , the former secretary of state had amassed 1,711 of the 2,383 delegates she would need to clinch the nomination before Saturday 's contests , according to CNN estimates . Before the voting Saturday , Sanders had notched 952 delegates to date . That means he would need to win 75 % of the remaining pledged delegates to defeat her .\nClinton did not address the results publicly on Saturday , but her campaign sought to raise money off her losses in Saturday 's contests , portraying them as a warning to donors . A short time after CNN projected Alaska as a win for Sanders , Clinton Campaign Manager Robby Mook circulated an email to her supporters billed as a `` quick update on Bernie Sanders . ''\n`` We have n't caught up in online fundraising , and our opponent could do very well in today 's caucuses in Washington , Alaska , and Hawaii , '' Mook said in the email before the Washington and Hawaii results had been called . `` Now , I do n't want to paint too gloomy a picture -- you 've been amazing .
