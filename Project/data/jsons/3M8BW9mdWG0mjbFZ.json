It \u2019 s the middle of October . There is no bill text . No specifics . Vague targets on corporate tax rates . Ambiguity on personal tax rates . Lots of buzzwords . Frameworks . Outlines . Principles .\nHouse Republicans huddled for five hours a few weeks ago at Fort McNair , not far from the Capitol , to discuss the plan . Yet many came away grousing that they didn \u2019 t know much more than they did before the August recess .\n\u201c We \u2019 re making good progress on tax reform , \u201d bragged the prospective author of the House \u2019 s tax reform package , Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady , R-Texas . \u201c I \u2019 m very pleased with the pace . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s not uncommon to hear such platitudes from Brady and other leading Republicans . But a reporter then asked him for specifics on the \u201c progress. \u201d Brady provided very little .\n\u201c We \u2019 re continuing to make improvements every day , \u201d he said , grinning .\n\u201c It is premature to identify which ones might be permanent , \u201d Brady replied .\nHow about an agreement on eliminating state and local deductions ?\n\u201c It just takes time to work through those options , \u201d he said .\nOregon Sen. Ron Wyden is the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee . A few weeks ago , he found himself in the dark when it came to specifics .\n\u201c It reminds me of these old movie theaters when they would say there was a big movie , \u201d Wyden mused . \u201c They would say \u2018 Coming Soon ! Coming Soon ! \u2019 But it never showed up . \u201d\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan , R-Wis. , insists tax reform is \u201c coming soon. \u201d And he even foretells when Congress must wrap this up .\n\u201c We \u2019 re going to keep people here for Christmas if we have to , \u201d he said . \u201c I mean , I don \u2019 t care . We \u2019 ve got to get this done . If we have to stay until Christmas , tough . We \u2019 ll do that . \u201d\nThe \u201c stay until Christmas \u201d threat isn \u2019 t new from congressional leaders of either party .\nEveryone knows that the real heavy lifting on Capitol Hill gets done around the holidays anyway . In December alone , lawmakers were already expected to tangle with a bill to avoid a government shutdown , deal with the young illegal immigrants known as \u201c DREAMers , \u201d stabilize health care markets , re-impose sanctions on Iran if the Trump administration totally nixes the nuclear pact with Tehran , perhaps lift the debt ceiling and approve additional installments to cover hurricanes and wildfires .\nSo Ryan \u2019 s threat just compounds an already vigorous schedule . Congressional signal-callers know that holding lawmakers hostage in Washington around the holidays often spurs results .\nWith big items on the agenda , members can not dash home to trim the tree , go Christmas shopping or hang the lights . Keep them on Capitol Hill away from their families and lawmakers will pass something , anything , just to get out of town .\nThat doesn \u2019 t mean the end product is good . Consider that the Senate found itself in a similar bind in July -- desperate to approve anything on health care . That effort imploded spectacularly . Moreover , in February and March , Ryan presented the initial version of the House GOP \u2019 s health care bill as a \u201c binary choice . \u201d\nTake it or leave it . Granted , the chamber finally approved such a bill in May . But a lack of support for the first bill forced Ryan to yank that proposal off the floor .\nRepublicans are already reeling over the health care debacle . If they stumble on tax reform , Republicans risk looking as bad as the U.S. Men \u2019 s Soccer Team failing to qualify for the World Cup after losing to Trinidad and Tobago .\nTax reform faces three major enemies : parliamentary math , time and deficits .\nThe House now has 433 members -- 239 Republicans and 194 Democrats . That means Republicans can only lose 23 votes on their side of the aisle . The chamber recently adopted a budget as a special legislative prerequisite on tax reform . The GOP lost 18 of its own on that roll call tally alone . In other words , this is tight .\nThere are 52 Republicans and 48 senators who caucus with the Democrats . It takes two rounds of 60 votes to quash a filibuster on most legislation . There is no way Republicans can muscle through tax reform and overcome a filibuster -- even if they convince a few Democrats to play along .\nSenate Republicans intend this week to approve a budget blueprint that can help them neutralize filibusters and just entail 51 votes to do about anything . But the Senate must first OK that budget .\nThe vote could be close . But there are some wild cards . Sen. Bob Menendez , D-N.J. , has generally missed votes in the Senate due to his corruption trial in New Jersey .\nThat helps Republicans . Sen. Thad Cochran , R-Miss. , has missed several weeks after a hospital stay . Cochran is due back this week . But his absence could boost Democrats .\nKnow this : if the Senate blunders in approving a budget , tax reform is dead because GOPers can \u2019 t overcome a filibuster .\nFor a variety of reasons , Ryan is reluctant to push tax reform into 2018 -- an election year .\nTax reform is his touchstone issue . So for the speaker , it \u2019 s optimum to wrap this up in 2017 . However , the House and Senate must take a little time to merge their respective budgets into one . That easily slides matter into November .\nBrady says he won \u2019 t schedule a \u201c markup \u201d session ( in which lawmakers actually write the bill ) until there \u2019 s resolution on the budget issue . If Brady sets up a markup , it likely means he has the votes to advance the tax bill out of committee .\nWith these barriers , it \u2019 s easy to see how days drip off the calendar in November , through Thanksgiving and get you to , voila , Christmas .\nRepublicans are confident that cutting taxes won \u2019 t bust the deficit . Those special budget rules , which enable GOPers to sidestep Senate filibusters , prohibit Congress from adding to the deficit over a 10-year period .\nBut rarely has Congress approved a bill under such rules that didn \u2019 t increase the deficit at the end of the 10-year window . Congress often puts \u201c tough \u201d spending decisions in the \u201c out \u201d years of such packages . The savings are never realized .\nThe national debt now stands at $ 20.38 trillion . Some economists and many lawmakers of both parties are skeptical that lower taxes can make up the difference in federal revenue via energized economic growth .\nFor years , Republicans extolled the virtues of \u201c cutting spending \u201d and eliminating deficits . There was barely a peep about deficits from House GOPers as they approved their budget two weeks ago . Some Republicans are starting to get antsy about how Congress is okaying nearly $ 52 billion in emergency disaster spending for the hurricanes and wildfires .\nNone of that spending was anticipated as recently as late August . None of the spending is offset .\nCongress is asked to approve 12 annual spending bills each year to fund the government . The two disaster bills account for essentially a \u201c 13th \u201d spending bill and a \u201c 14th \u201d spending bill . Two or three additional disaster bills are likely in the coming months .\nThe first two emergency bills combined cost about the same as what Congress allotted for Commerce , Justice and Science programs ( one of the spending bills ) in fiscal 2016 . This is almost $ 13 billion more than was allocated in fiscal 16 for the entire Department of Homeland Security and nearly $ 12 billion more than was appropriated for the State Department .\nOf the 12 annual spending bills , the two emergency bills together are only smaller than the annual defense bill , the Labor/HHS bill , the Transportation/Housing bill and the Military Construction/VA bill .\nLawmakers don \u2019 t regret spending for natural disasters . But the deficit-reduction conversation has gone silent .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve come to the realization that we simply can not cut , \u201d conceded one conservative House Republican .\nThe question is whether those budgetary concerns are realized in opposition to the tax reform bill .\nSo not a lot is known right now on tax reform .\nEarlier this year , Ryan argued strenuously for the inclusion of a \u201c Border Adjustment Tax \u201d or BAT , in the tax-reform package .
