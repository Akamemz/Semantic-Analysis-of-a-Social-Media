Individual policies available outside the exchange through United Healthcare or through a broker would go up by 31 % , on average , with hikes as high as 60 % for certain plans in certain locations . In Texas , insurer Scott & White is looking for a 32 % increase for exchange-based plans , while Humana ( HUM ) is asking for an average 30 % boost for its exclusive provider organization policies , which generally cover only in-network services .
