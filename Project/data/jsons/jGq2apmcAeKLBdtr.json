    "content": "Republican senators are struggling to articulate why they are rushing to pass their last-ditch effort to repeal and replace Obamacare over the next 10 days before running into their September 30 deadline .\nIn interviews with \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Tuesday , nine Republican senators primarily argued that their \u201c Hail Mary \u201d bill \u2014 spearheaded by Sens . Lindsey Graham ( SC ) and Bill Cassidy ( LA ) \u2014 would return federal power to the states , giving them greater flexibility to improve their health systems locally . \u201c The heart of the legislation takes the policymaking role of Washington and sends it to the states , \u201d Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said .\nFar less clear is exactly how Graham-Cassidy would pull off this feat without resulting in millions of Americans losing their insurance \u2014 and the number of millions is still unknown , since any vote would likely have to come before the Congressional Budget Office completes its analysis of the bill . The GOP senators insisted that the tens of billions in cuts to federal health spending proposed in the bill would not result in coverage losses because , they said , the states would have more flexibility .\n\u201c They can do it with less money , \u201d said Sen. Jim Inhofe ( R-OK ) , who was unable to explain how or why .\nOther Republican senators , meanwhile , fell back on political explanations for a bill that experts warn could result in millions losing their insurance . \u201c If we do nothing , it has a tremendous impact on the 2018 elections , \u201d said Sen. Pat Roberts ( R-KS ) . \u201c And whether or not Republicans still maintain control and we have the gavel . \u201d\nAnd then some members of the upper chamber acknowledged that the spending changes might have a big impact , but argued their home states would not be negatively impacted . \u201c Four of our states are getting a disproportionate amount of money from health care now , \u201d Sen. Richard Shelby ( R-AL ) said . The bill , he added , \u201c wouldn \u2019 t cut Alabama. \u201d ( Numbers from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities suggest Alabama would receive more than $ 1 billion in additional funding under the bill , but most states would see big cuts . )\nThe stakes of the Republican rush to repeal and replace Obamacare could hardly be higher . The GOP has less than two weeks to pass a repeal-and-replace plan before their budget reconciliation instructions expire , and the insurance of tens of millions of Americans hangs in the balance .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 conducted the interviews with nine Republican senators throughout the Capitol and Russell Senate Office Building on Tuesday .\nSen. Pat Roberts ( R-KS ) : \u201c If we do nothing , it has a tremendous impact on the 2018 elections \u201d\nSenator , I wanted to ask you for a policy-based explanation for why you \u2019 re moving forward with the Graham-Cassidy proposal . What problems will this solve in the health care system ?\nThat \u2014 that is the last stage out of Dodge City .\nI \u2019 m just trying to explain to our readers what the policy \u2014\n... [ Graham-Cassidy ] is the last stage out of Dodge City . I \u2019 m from Dodge City . So it \u2019 s the last stage out to do anything . Restoring decision-making back to the states is always a good idea , but this is not the best possible bill \u2014 this is the best bill possible under the circumstances .\nIf we do nothing , I think it has a tremendous impact on the 2018 elections . And whether or not Republicans still maintain control and we have the gavel .\nBut why does this bill make things better for Americans ? How does it help ?\nWhy does this make things better ? What is this doing ?\nLook , we \u2019 re in the back seat of a convertible being driven by Thelma and Louise , and we \u2019 re headed toward the canyon . That \u2019 s a movie that you \u2019 ve probably never seen \u2014\nSo we have to get out of the car , and you have to have a car to get into , and this is the only car there is .\nSen. Jim Inhofe ( R-OK ) : \u201c Efficiencies \u201d from federal-state transfer \u201c can very well make up the difference \u201d\nWhat \u2019 s the policy explanation for the Graham-Cassidy bill ? What substantive problems does this solve ?\nWell , first of all , as a general rule the states do things better than the federal government does [ things ] . And that is essentially what the bill is . We actually had a bill that passed , except at the last minute \u2014 as you know \u2014 we had one deciding vote against it that was unforeseen . And I think what we \u2019 re looking at right now is essentially the same thing .\nIt \u2019 s a stronger position for the states to be in , and generally , Republicans agree with that .\nI understand what you \u2019 re saying with the states having the ability to make these decisions , but the bill doesn \u2019 t just \u201c give states more freedom \u201d \u2014 it also cuts federal funding to the states . So it \u2019 s not just about giving the states more control ; it \u2019 s also about cutting federal expenditures , right ?\nWell , yes , but that doesn \u2019 t mean it \u2019 s going to be \u2014 I think the efficiencies that come with transferring the funding to the states can very well make up the difference between what the federal thing would be .\nI mean it \u2019 s more efficient when it \u2019 s done from the states , and so they can do it with less money .\nAre you confident , and how do you know those savings will be close to enough to protect everyone ?\nSen. Ted Cruz ( R-TX ) : \u201c It lets states innovate and adopt creative solutions \u201d\nI \u2019 m looking for a broad policy explanation for what Graham-Cassidy will do \u2014 how does it improve the American health care system ?\nWell , the details of it are still being negotiated , but the heart of the legislation takes the policymaking role of Washington and sends it to the states . It lets states innovate and adopt creative solutions to local problems , which vary state by state .\nBut it \u2019 s not just devolving power from the federal government to the state . It also involves a 16 percent cut in federal spending [ upfront ] and a 34 percent cut over the next 10 years .\nIf you \u2019 re saying , \u201c Let \u2019 s just devolve power to the states , \u201d why also cut federal spending so dramatically ?\nMy central focus from the beginning has been on lowering health insurance premiums .\nThe biggest reason so many millions of people are hurting under Obamacare is that it has made premiums skyrocket . And what I think is critical for Obamacare repeal is that we expand consumer freedom so that you , the consumer , can be in charge of what health insurance you want to buy , and we lower premiums so that health insurance is more affordable . ...\nWhy not wait until the CBO says what you \u2019 re saying about premiums ? Why not confirm with them ? Over the first few votes , the CBO suggested that premiums would go up and that tens of millions of people would lose health insurance .\nCBO \u2019 s analysis throughout this process has been ridiculously slow , unreliable , and based on policy assumptions that are demonstrably false .\nYou really believe that cutting federal spending by 34 percent will not result in any other people losing their insurance ?\nWell , the Medicaid expansion would be sunset , for one , is my understanding .\nThe decrease in future rates of growth is not a cut . And it is only in the bizarre world of Washington that billions more money is characterized in the press as a cut rather than an increase , which is in fact what it is .\nSen. John Kennedy ( R-LA ) : \u201c Read the bill and you \u2019 ll understand \u201d\nI think it \u2019 s an improvement over Obamacare , but I have sent four amendments to Lindsey [ Graham ] and Bill [ Cassidy ] that I think will strengthen the bill . The one I feel most strongly about is that I want the Medicaid work requirement \u2014 I don \u2019 t want it to be optional ; I want it to be a requirement . Just like we did with welfare reform .\nAnd number two , I want to get us to give guardrails to the states to say , \u201c You can not use these moneys to set up a state-run single-payer system. \u201d I don \u2019 t believe in it . I think it \u2019 s a mistake .\nI \u2019 ve lived under a single-payer system , and I think the bill would be stronger with that prohibition . [ That \u2019 s an apparent reference to England , where Kennedy received a law degree in the 1970s and which has the National Health Service . ]\nDo you think that kind of goes against the idea of states \u2019 rights and being able to use this money [ as the states want to ] ?\nNo , no . We have plenty of federal rules that apply to every state , but we still agree with states \u2019 rights .\nWhat are the main policy explanations for getting behind this bill ? What does this bill do right , policy-wise ?\nMy position has always been that , number one , I think Obamacare has been a failure .\nNumber two : First chance I get to vote for repeal it , I \u2019 ll do it .\nAnd number three : If it \u2019 s replacement , if replacement is better than Obamacare , I will vote for it .\nI think it spends scarce resources in a more rational manner . It will control costs . I like the idea that it encourages states to innovate .\nWell , you \u2019 re voting for it , right ? So what is the explanation for how it does those things ?\nI am . Because it gives states added flexibility . Read the bill and you \u2019 ll understand .\nIn broad strokes , what do you think this bill is going to accomplish ?\nThis is what a lot of us ran on \u2014 we \u2019 ve been advocating it for years . Let the states run it . They know more about it . They run the Medicaid program . They run our highway programs . We send 80 percent of money to various transit and highway stations \u2014 there , where the rubber hits the road .\nBut it \u2019 s not just that it devolves power to the states \u2014 it also involves a 16 percent cut in federal health spending .\nBut I \u2019 ll tell you what : Our states \u2014 our 50 states \u2014 are very flexible , very innovative . Much more so than we are here . I think it will work , and it will be a big step toward federalism .\nThe bill would cut federal funding to states by 34 percent over the next \u2014\nWell , do you think the other states should deal with \u2014\nWell , you see some of our states , four of our states , are getting a disproportionate amount of money from health care now . You know which ones .\nSen. Johnny Isakson ( R-GA ) : \u201c I do n't know what the numbers are going to end up looking like \u201d\nWhat is the policy explanation for the Graham-Cassidy health care bill ?\nPolicy explanation ? I \u2019 m not into policy , so I don \u2019 t really know . I \u2019 m into facts .\n[ In a follow-up interview hours later on Tuesday ] You were joking earlier , but what is the health policy in the Graham-Cassidy proposal that you like ?\nThe governors \u2014 I 'm from a state that did n't expand Medicaid , and the way we were going in health care looked like those states would actually be hurt worse than other states .\nBy going to block grants , back to the states , the control of money stays with the states , and you have less [ un ] predictability and external deviation in terms of funding .\nSo just a follow-up on that . It 's one thing to say the bill gives the states power \u2014 that \u2019 s one thing .\nBut it does n't just do that . It also cuts the money they have \u2014 some estimates say around 16 percent of federal funding .\nI 'm not going to confirm that statement one way or another . I do n't know what the numbers are going to end up looking like .\nRight , but if it does cut federal spending overall , would you support it ?\nYou know , those are dangerous questions . I 'm waiting until I see the totality of the legislation to say whether I support the whole thing or not , anyway .\nI 'm not a no , but I 'm not a yes either \u2014 and I 'm waiting for my governor to respond to me with their input as well . It \u2019 s really key what they \u2019 re doing .\nSen. John Barrasso ( R-WY ) : \u201c The governors who decided to expand [ Medicaid ] knew that they were going to lose federal funding \u201d\nI want to ask , in a big-picture way : What is the policy explanation for how this bill makes people \u2019 s lives better ?\nIt gets the money out of Washington , lets people at home make the decision , and gets state legislatures involved , and governors involved . It moves money out of Washington . It \u2019 s away from socialism .\nCBPP says it will also reduce federal health spending on Medicaid and the exchanges by about [ 20 ] percent .\nRight , but so it \u2019 s not just about moving power to the states \u2014 it \u2019 s also about cutting funding .\nIt \u2019 s about moving power to the states , where money can be spent much more effectively .\nWell , you have to read the formula and read the bill , and it will tell you how it moves money to the states and how much they get and how much they don \u2019 t get . ...\nThere \u2019 s a concern from Republican governors who have come out and said , \u201c This is too dramatic a cut in spending ; we won \u2019 t have enough money to insure everyone . \u201d\nWell , it depends on if they \u2019 re states that expanded Medicaid or not . ...\nIn the Medicaid expansion states , they still have a lot of people who rely on Medicaid expansion for health insurance .\nI opposed Medicaid expansion . I think the Supreme Court got it wrong [ when it ruled in 2012 that Congress did have the constitutional authority to implement most of Obamacare ] .\nThe governors who decided to expand [ Medicaid ] knew that they were going to lose federal funding over time , and they \u2019 re objecting to that \u2014 but they knew it . You could say , \u201c Some of them didn \u2019 t understand it , and so-and-so wasn \u2019 t there , and he wasn \u2019 t governor yet , \u201d but they understood that this would be part of the process . So if they used the money poorly \u2014\nAnd my concern with Medicaid is that the people who Medicaid was designed for originally have been cut out of the process , because they \u2019 re still on the waiting list to get on Medicaid . I don \u2019 t know how much you understand about Medicaid , but this whole expansion of Medicaid went for healthy , working-age individuals \u2014 it did not go for the people who [ Medicaid ] was designed for , which was low-income women , children , and the disabled .\nSen. Luther Strange ( R-AL ) : \u201c I like the idea of sending money back to the states and letting the states experiment \u201d\nI had a quick question on the Graham-Cassidy bill \u2014 could you explain what the policy purpose of the bill is ? What is this bill going to achieve , policy-wise ?\nHonestly , I have a meeting to talk about that shortly \u2014 so let me get back to you on that shortly . I have to talk to my staff .\n[ In a follow-up conversation with Strange about eight hours later ]\nWe \u2019 re still looking at the details on how it affects Alabama , so we haven \u2019 t taken a position on it yet .\nI like the idea of sending money back to the states and letting each state experiment with what \u2019 s best for their citizens . But I haven \u2019 t seen enough detail to know how it affects Alabama to have taken a position on it .\nDo you worry about the billions in cuts in federal health care expenditures ?\nThat \u2019 s the kind of detail I haven \u2019 t seen on how it would affect our state .\nHow it affects the state of Alabama , and how we are treated as a non-expansion state .\nWill you be looking for protections for those with pre-existing conditions ? What else matters ?\nSen. Chuck Grassley ( R-IA ) : \u201c This is the last attempt to do what we promised in the election \u201d\nI was hoping you could explain , in broad detail , what the point of Graham-Cassidy is .\nLet me give you a political answer , and then I \u2019 ll give you a substance answer .\nThe political answer is that Republicans have promised for seven years that we were going to correct all the things that were wrong with Obamacare , and we failed the first eight months . This is the last attempt to do what we promised in the election .\nThe substance answer is that Obamacare starts with the principle that all knowledge about health care , and all decisions on health care , ought to rest in Washington , DC . The complete opposite of that is Graham-Cassidy , that Washington doesn \u2019 t know best and we \u2019 ll let each of the 50 states [ decide what \u2019 s best ] .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588-mark Sign up for the newsletter VoxCare Email ( required ) Zip Code By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy .

You know which ones.\n\nSen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA): \u201cI don't know what the numbers are going to end up looking like\u201d\n\nJeff Stein\n\nWhat is the policy explanation for the Graham-Cassidy health care bill?\n\nJohnny Isakson\n\nPolicy explanation? I\u2019m not into policy, so I don\u2019t really know. I\u2019m into facts.\n\nJeff Stein\n\n[In a follow-up interview hours later on Tuesday] You were joking earlier, but what is the health policy in the Graham-Cassidy proposal that you like?\n\nJohnny Isakson\n\nMore state innovation. More input from the states.\n\nJeff Stein\n\nWhat does that mean, exactly?\n\nJohnny Isakson\n\nThe governors \u2014 I'm from a state that didn't expand Medicaid, and the way we were going in health care looked like those states would actually be hurt worse than other states.\n\nBy going to block grants, back to the states, the control of money stays with the states, and you have less [un]predictability and external deviation in terms of funding.\n\nJeff Stein\n\nSo just a follow-up on that. It's one thing to say the bill gives the states power \u2014 that\u2019s one thing.\n\nBut it doesn't just do that. It also cuts the money they have \u2014 some estimates say around 16 percent of federal funding.\n\nJohnny Isakson\n\nI'm not going to confirm that statement one way or another. I don't know what the numbers are going to end up looking like.\n\nJeff Stein\n\nRight, but if it does cut federal spending overall, would you support it?\n\nJohnny Isakson\n\nYou know, those are dangerous questions. I'm waiting until I see the totality of the legislation to say whether I support the whole thing or not, anyway.\n\nI'm not a no, but I'm not a yes either \u2014 and I'm waiting for my governor to respond to me with their input as well. It\u2019s really key what they\u2019re doing.\n\nSen. John Barrasso (R-WY): \u201cThe governors who decided to expand [Medicaid] knew that they were going to lose federal funding\u201d\n\nJeff Stein\n\nI want to ask, in a big-picture way: What is the policy explanation for how this bill makes people\u2019s lives better?\n\nJohn Barrasso\n\nIt gets the money out of Washington, lets people at home make the decision, and gets state legislatures involved, and governors involved. It moves money out of Washington. It\u2019s away from socialism.\n\nJeff Stein\n\nCBPP says it will also reduce federal health spending on Medicaid and the exchanges by about [20] percent.\n\nJohn Barrasso\n\nI\u2019d love to reduce federal spending on health insurance.\n\nJeff Stein\n\nRight, but so it\u2019s not just about moving power to the states \u2014 it\u2019s also about cutting funding.\n\nJohn Barrasso\n\nIt\u2019s about moving power to the states, where money can be spent much more effectively.\n\nJeff Stein\n\nHow does it do that?\n\nJohn Barrasso\n\nWell, you have to read the formula and read the bill, and it will tell you how it moves money to the states and how much they get and how much they don\u2019t get. ...\n\nJeff Stein\n\nThere\u2019s a concern from Republican governors who have come out and said, \u201cThis is too dramatic a cut in spending; we won\u2019t have enough money to insure everyone.\u201d\n\nJohn Barrasso\n\nYou have to interview them on that.\n\nJeff Stein\n\nDo you think they\u2019re wrong?\n\nJohn Barrasso\n\nWell, it depends on if they\u2019re states that expanded Medicaid or not. ...\n\nJeff Stein\n\nIn the Medicaid expansion states, they still have a lot of people who rely on Medicaid expansion for health insurance.\n\nJohn Barrasso\n\nI opposed Medicaid expansion. I think the Supreme Court got it wrong [when it ruled in 2012 that Congress did have the constitutional authority to implement most of Obamacare].\n\nThe governors who decided to expand [Medicaid] knew that they were going to lose federal funding over time, and they\u2019re objecting to that \u2014 but they knew it. You could say, \u201cSome of them didn\u2019t understand it, and so-and-so wasn\u2019t there, and he wasn\u2019t governor yet,\u201d but they understood that this would be part of the process. So if they used the money poorly \u2014\n\nAnd my concern with Medicaid is that the people who Medicaid was designed for originally have been cut out of the process, because they\u2019re still on the waiting list to get on Medicaid. I don\u2019t know how much you understand about Medicaid, but this whole expansion of Medicaid went for healthy, working-age individuals \u2014 it did not go for the people who [Medicaid] was designed for, which was low-income women, children, and the disabled.\n\nSen. Luther Strange (R-AL): \u201cI like the idea of sending money back to the states and letting the states experiment\u201d\n\nJeff Stein\n\nI had a quick question on the Graham-Cassidy bill \u2014 could you explain what the policy purpose of the bill is? What is this bill going to achieve, policy-wise?\n\nLuther Strange\n\nHonestly, I have a meeting to talk about that shortly \u2014 so let me get back to you on that shortly. I have to talk to my staff.\n\nJeff Stein\n\n[In a follow-up conversation with Strange about eight hours later]\n\nSo what do you think?\n\nLuther Strange\n\nWe\u2019re still looking at the details on how it affects Alabama, so we haven\u2019t taken a position on it yet.\n\nI like the idea of sending money back to the states and letting each state experiment with what\u2019s best for their citizens. But I haven\u2019t seen enough detail to know how it affects Alabama to have taken a position on it.\n\nJeff Stein\n\nDo you worry about the billions in cuts in federal health care expenditures?\n\nLuther Strange\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of detail I haven\u2019t seen on how it would affect our state.\n\nJeff Stein\n\nAnything in particular you\u2019ll be looking for?\n\nLuther Strange\n\nHow it affects the state of Alabama, and how we are treated as a non-expansion state.\n\nJeff Stein\n\nWill you be looking for protections for those with pre-existing conditions? What else matters?\n\nLuther Strange\n\nAll of the above.\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA): \u201cThis is the last attempt to do what we promised in the election\u201d\n\nJeff Stein\n\nI was hoping you could explain, in broad detail, what the point of Graham-Cassidy is.\n\nChuck Grassley\n\nLet me give you a political answer, and then I\u2019ll give you a substance answer.\n\nThe political answer is that Republicans have promised for seven years that we were going to correct all the things that were wrong with Obamacare, and we failed the first eight months. This is the last attempt to do what we promised in the election.\n\nThe substance answer is that Obamacare starts with the principle that all knowledge about health care, and all decisions on health care, ought to rest in Washington, DC. The complete opposite of that is Graham-Cassidy, that Washington doesn\u2019t know best and we\u2019ll let each of the 50 states [decide what\u2019s best].\n\nvox-mark Sign up for the newsletter VoxCare Email (required) Zip Code By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy.
