    "content": "For the Supreme Court , whether President Obama \u2019 s recess appointments were legal could well rest on whether the justices side with Presidents Washington , Jefferson and Madison , or whether they stick with the 40 men who followed the founders .\nThe case the court will hear Monday has all the makings of a legal thriller \u2014 Congress battling the president , with the Supreme Court , sitting for its first oral argument of 2014 , called to settle the spat .\nIt \u2019 s also what lawyers call a \u201c case of first impression , \u201d meaning the justices have never ruled on this particular question , so there is no firm precedent to guide them .\nMaking the issue all the more delicious for Washington are the accusations of power grabs and political hypocrisy : Mr. Obama , who is claiming broad recess powers , objected to those very same powers when he was in the Senate and Democrats used the same questionable tactics in 2007 and 2008 to block President George W. Bush \u2019 s appointments .\n\u201c Three federal circuit courts of appeals have already ruled that the president violated the Constitution when he made so-called recess appointments while the Senate was in session , and now the U.S. Supreme Court has an opportunity to guard against the dangers of an imperial presidency , \u201d said Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee , one of the Republicans who have pushed back the hardest against Mr. Obama .\nThe president \u2019 s defenders say a ruling against Mr. Obama would be a recipe for gridlock on Capitol Hill , with senators free to delay or block a president \u2019 s nominees and the chief executive with no way to circumvent them .\n\u201c If the Supreme Court rules against this power , important posts would remain unfilled for months at a time , adding to an already historic level of government dysfunction , \u201d said David Earley , a lawyer at the Brennan Center for Justice who just completed an analysis of the issues at stake .\nThe court has a few questions to answer : First , what vacancies can be filled by recess appointments ? Second , what constitutes a recess for the purposes of using that power ?
