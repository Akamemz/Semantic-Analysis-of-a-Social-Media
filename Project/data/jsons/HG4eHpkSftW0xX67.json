Three months ago, there was hope it could be contained. Now, the pandemic appears all-consuming. Longer lasting lockdowns, a ceiling on activity for contact-intensive sectors, the scarring impact of high unemployment, and stimulus that - in some important parts of the world - is falling short, all weigh on the outlook. Bloomberg Economics is lowering its estimate for global growth in 2020, and anticipates a weaker recovery into 2021.
