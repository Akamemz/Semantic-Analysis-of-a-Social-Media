Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler , D-N.Y. , also imposed a Monday morning deadline for Barr to turn over the full , unredacted Mueller report and additional files -- a deadline the DOJ apparently missed , prompting Nadler to schedule a Wednesday vote on contempt proceedings against Barr .\nCommittee member Rep. Steve Cohen , D-Tenn. , over the weekend urged the panel to specifically pursue \u201c inherent contempt , \u201d calling for Barr to be arrested by the Sergeant at Arms and be physically brought before the committee to testify\u2014a tactic reportedly not employed since the 1930s .\n\u201c I think they will stonewall at all costs , \u201d Cohen told CNN \u2019 s Anderson Cooper , adding that the situation \u201c leaves us no other alternative than to have our Sergeant at Arms bring him in . He is being utterly contemptuous of Congress . He lied to the Congress . \u201d\nInherent contempt , which allows a person to be held until they provide testimony , is one of three contempt options available , along with criminal contempt ( under which an individual is charged with a crime ) and civil judgment ( leading to a civil court process )\nCohen added : \u201c You have to have him sit for a hearing and you have to have him locked up until he agrees to participate and come to the hearing . \u201d\nCohen said that he did not know what the committee would do but argued that without pursuing that avenue , a congressional contempt citation would be \u201c meaningless . \u201d\nThe DOJ has not publicly responded to Cohen 's warning , though a spokeswoman fired back last week when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused Barr of committing a crime by allegedly lying in prior testimony . The DOJ called the attack `` reckless , irresponsible and false . ''\nStill , the scenario Cohen suggested has thus far not been entertained by higher-ranking Democrats . Cohen -- who drew mockery last week for bringing a KFC bucket to the no-show hearing , eating fried chicken in full view of press cameras and placing a toy chicken by Barr 's empty seat in order to suggest Barr is , himself , like a chicken -- even suggested the contempt scenarios might not produce much action .\n\u201c It shows we want to hold him in contempt , but that fact is , he won \u2019 t be held in contempt because the Justice Department is not going to enforce a contempt citation against their boss , \u201d Cohen explained . \u201c It \u2019 s just not going to happen .
