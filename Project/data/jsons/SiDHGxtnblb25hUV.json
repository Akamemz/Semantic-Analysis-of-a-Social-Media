    "content": "Registered voters by 2-1 think Barack Obama will win the upcoming presidential debates and go on to prevail in the November election . But expectations aside , the race remains close , with strengths and vulnerabilities for both candidates in the campaign ahead .\nAfter a challenging period for Romney , registered voters by 63-31 percent expect Obama to win re-election , his widest advantage in expectations in \u2588\u2588\u2588/Washington Post polls to date . A year ago , in sharp contrast , Americans by an 18-point margin thought he 'd lose .\nPotential voters by a similar 56-29 percent also expect Obama to win the debates beginning Wednesday night in Denver - a result that ratchets up the pressure on the president to perform , leaving Romney , whatever his difficulties , greater opportunity to exceed expectations .\nThe contest between them , regardless , is far closer than those prognostications would suggest . Registered voters in this survey , produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates , divide by 49-44 percent between Obama and Romney , with the race a virtual tie , 49-47 percent , among those most likely to vote .\nWhile those standings are essentially unchanged from their immediate post-convention levels , some results indicate a slight tailwind for Obama . Ratings of the economy , while very negative , have grown less intensely so since late August ( 39 percent say it 's in poor shape , down from 45 percent ) . Obama 's 47 percent approval rating for handling the economy , while still underwater , is numerically its highest in more than two years . And views that the nation is headed seriously off on the wrong track have eased by 9 percentage points to the fewest since January 2011 .\nASSETS - Obama enjoys other key assets . Sixty-six percent say his policies have favored the middle class , while 57 percent think Romney 's , instead , would favor the wealthy - not a significant change since Romney 's `` 47 percent '' comment , but still a deep disadvantage for the Republican . And registered voters by 52-39 percent think Obama better understands the economic problems of average Americans , again not significantly different from early September , but numerically his widest lead over Romney in this measure since February .\nAnd there 's the controversial comment itself - Romney 's assertion at a surreptitiously recorded fundraiser that 47 percent of Americans do n't pay income taxes , see themselves as victims and lack personal responsibility . Registered voters , however , by 57-39 percent say it 's fair that some people ( chiefly senior citizens , people on disability , students , the working poor and the unemployed ) do n't pay income taxes . And it cuts to vote : Among the majority that sees this as fair , Obama leads by 20 points . Among those who think such people ought to pay at least some taxes , though , it 's Romney by 17 .\nTune in to ABCNews.com on Wednesday for livestreaming coverage of the first 2012 Presidential Debate from Denver , Colo. Coverage kicks off with \u2588\u2588\u2588 ' live preview show at noon , and full debate coverage begins at 8 p.m .\nYet there are substantial liabilities for Obama as well . Seventy-eight percent of registered voters are worried about the economy 's direction in the next few years . Six in 10 are worried about their own family 's financial situation . Fewer than half , 47 percent , are confident the economy will improve if Obama is re-elected . Just 28 percent are persuaded that the federal economic stimulus program in fact helped the economy ( about as many think it hurt ) . Obama 's job approval rating among registered voters , 49 percent , remains less than a majority . And `` wrong track '' sentiment , while down , is still 60 percent - high enough to threaten an incumbent .\nMoreover , back to the `` 47 percent '' comment , there 's a tilt Romney 's way on the question of government dependency : Registered voters by 51-43 percent say government programs to help poor people do more to increase dependency than to get people back on their feet . ( On programs to help the unemployed those views are reversed . )\nResults such as these keep Romney in the hunt . He leads by nearly 50 points , for instance , among registered voters who say the country 's headed off on the wrong track , by 72 points among those who rate Obama 's economic performance negatively , by 43 points among those who question the effect of government programs for the poor and by nearly 60 points among those who are `` very '' worried about the economy 's direction .\nBut - with the clock ticking - Romney has not taken full advantage of these opportunities . Among those who are `` somewhat '' rather than `` very '' worried about the economy , Obama leads by 60-36 percent . And despite Obama 's difficulties on the economy , he runs evenly with Romney among registered voters overall in trust to handle it , 47-47 percent .\nBASELINES - Still , Romney 's made progress on some baseline attitudes . Last February , 66 percent of registered voters said he had not paid his fair share of taxes ; today that 's dropped sharply , to 48 percent . That 's mainly because Republicans and Republican-leaning independents have moved to his side on this question since he clinched the GOP nomination .\nThere 's also been an 8-point increase since last winter in the number of registered voters who see Romney 's wealth as more of a positive than a negative , to 51 percent , again chiefly because of movement among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents .\nThere 's also been a slight , 5-point decline since late August in the number who see unfairness in the economic system as a bigger problem than over-regulation of the free market ; the division is now 49-42 percent . And while registered voters by 52-43 percent think the government should try to address the gap between wealthy and less well-off Americans , that 's narrowed from 58-37 percent last year , when economic discontent was at a higher pitch .\nAll these cut sharply to vote , indicating their potential importance in the debates ahead . Registered voters who think the government should try to reduce the wealth gap favor Obama over Romney by 75-21 percent ; those who say otherwise favor Romney , 72-20 percent . Those more concerned with unfairness in the economic system are for Obama by 77-18 percent , while those more focused on over-regulation back Romney , by an identical margin .\nTRUST ON ISSUES - Trust on individual issues generally is stable , with surprising strength for Obama in two areas . Repeating results from early September , he 's competitive with Romney in trust to handle taxes and the federal deficit . Both traditionally are stronger for Republicans .\nAt the same time , Romney remains competitive vs. Obama in trust to handle health care , usually a better issue for Democrats , but less so given the country 's divisions over the Affordable Care Act . The candidates likewise are closely matched on Medicare , 47-43 percent , likely with ACA-related concerns counteracting broad skepticism of Paul Ryan 's plans for Medicare .\nRatings on international affairs are inconclusive ; on one hand Romney 's narrowed the gap in trust to handle them , now 49-44 percent , Obama-Romney ; on the other , measuring the two separately , 64 percent say Obama knows enough about world affairs to serve effectively , while fewer , 51 percent , say the same about Romney .\nThere also remain issues on which Obama clearly leads , vs. no such for Romney . Those include trust to handle terrorism ( 53-39 percent ) , a major crisis ( 52-42 percent ) , social issues such as abortion and gay marriage ( 52-38 percent ) and women 's issues ( 54-36 percent ) .\nPERSONALLY SPEAKING - Romney 's lack of an advantage in trust on the economy leaves room for personal attributes to come into play , and on these he 's generally vulnerable . One has worsened for him : Registered voters by 52-40 percent say they 'd prefer Obama as the captain if they were on a ship in a storm , opening up from a 46-43 percent split last month .\nIn other , lighthearted measures , Obama leads Romney by anywhere from 14 to 25 points on whom registered voters would rather go camping with , have as a dinner guest , see as a contestant on Dancing with the Stars , or whose music playlist they 'd rather hear . Helpfully for Romney , though , the two are even on another measure - one that requires the greatest level of personal responsibility : Whom you 'd rather have babysit for your kids .\nApart from babysitting , these measures add up to personal likeability , and on a direct measure of that attribute Obama retains his single biggest advantage , 62-29 percent over Romney . However it 's empathy , not likeability , that far more strongly predicts vote preference , and on that , as noted , Obama 's advantage is 13 points , not 33 .\nGROUPS AND TURNOUT - Patterns among groups generally fit their recent norms . There 's a gender gap among registered voters - a 10-point Obama lead among women , vs. essentially a tied race among men . Obama trails by 13 points among white voters , but leads overwhelmingly among nonwhites , with 77 percent support . And independents - often swing voters in national elections - divide precisely evenly .\nWhat matters , critically , is who turns out . Among Obama 's supporters in this survey , 51 percent describe themselves as very enthusiastic about their choice - notably fewer than its level at this time four years ago , 61 percent . Indeed Romney has closed the enthusiasm gap from early September ; then he trailed Obama by 10 points in very enthusiastic supporters . Today it 's an insignificant 3 points .\nRomney also has ramped up his get-out-the vote efforts . In late August , 31 percent of Obama 's supporters said they 'd been contacted by his campaign , while just 18 percent of Romney 's backers said they 'd heard from their candidate . Today Obama 's outreach number is essentially the same , while Romney 's has advanced , virtually to parity : Twenty-six percent of his supporters now say they 've heard from him .\nAmong the particular challenges for Obama are young voters : A mainstay of his support in 2008 , they 're far less likely now to say they 're certain to turn out .\nGetting out the vote , for both candidates , may carry the extra burden of battling expectations . Among Obama 's supporters , 96 percent expect him to win - raising the risk that some will feel secure enough not to bother turning out . Among Romney 's , at the same time , 28 percent pick Obama to win - suggesting the possibility they 'll be demotivated . Between the two , fighting expectations may be hardest for Romney : In fall season election polling since 1984 , when most Americans have expected one candidate to win , he has .\nMETHODOLOGY - This \u2588\u2588\u2588/Washington Post poll was conducted by telephone Sept. 26-29 , 2012 , among a random national sample of 1,101 adults , including 929 registered voters and 813 likely voters , including landline and cell-phone-only respondents .
