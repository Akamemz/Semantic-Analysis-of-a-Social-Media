    "content": "Several Afghanistan experts , including the former commanding general of U.S. forces in the region and the chairman of the violence-plagued country \u2019 s biggest and most influential news media outlet , expressed outrage Thursday after the New York Times published the uncontradicted peace-talk musings of a man who is arguably one of the world \u2019 s most accomplished terrorists .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a disgrace , \u201d Saad Mohseni , chairman of the Kabul-based Moby Media Group , told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 about the op-ed credited to Sirajuddin Haqqani , whom the newspaper identified simply as \u201c the deputy leader of the Taliban. \u201d That is , without reference to his leadership of the mass-murdering Haqqani Network founded by his late father , Afghan warlord Jalaluddin Haqqani .\n\u201c The problem with this op-ed is that they \u2019 re giving a pretty nasty individual , with a track record [ of terrorism ] second to none of anyone else on the planet , this platform , \u201d Mohseni said . \u201c The New York Times is a hard place to get an op-ed in . But to have him be able to express his views unchallenged is a disgrace . \u201d\nRetired four-star Marine Gen. John R.

The Haqqani Network was implicated in that incident . \u201c Now that they \u2019 re at the negotiating table , I suppose that they \u2019 re batting their eyes like Bambi. \u201d The Times op-ed , however , \u201c is a very deterministic tactical move by a canny survivor of the jihadist wars who feels himself to be within reach of the prize , \u201d he said .\nTimes Editorial Page Editor James Bennet declined to answer questions from The \u2588\u2588\u2588 , and directed this writer to the newspaper \u2019 s spokesperson . `` We know firsthand how dangerous and destructive the Taliban is , \u201d the spokesperson emailed in defense of the op-ed . \u201c The Times is one of the only American news organizations to have maintained a fulltime team of reporters in Afghanistan since the start of the war nearly 20 years ago .
