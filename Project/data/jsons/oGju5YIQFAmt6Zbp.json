At 42 , Mr. Ryan is the same age as Mr. Romney \u2019 s eldest son , Tagg .\nThe two men campaigned together through Virginia , North Carolina and Wisconsin , with Mr. Ryan introducing himself to the nation , showing an easy comfort when greeting supporters and firing up crowds by attacking President Obama \u2019 s policies and talking up his man at the top of the GOP ticket .\nHe accused Mr. Obama \u2019 s campaign of going from a 2008 run based on \u201c hope and change \u201d to one of \u201c attack and blame . \u201d\n\u201c We \u2019 re not going to fall for it , \u201d Mr. Ryan told a cheering crowd in High Point , N.C .\nAnd while Mr. Romney was pilloried earlier in the campaign for casually mentioning that he had a few friends who were NASCAR team owners , Mr. Ryan appeared thrilled just to meet one of the NASCAR drivers on Sunday .\n\u201c This is awesome , \u201d he told a crowd of 10,000-plus at the Absolute Style furniture company in High Point after exchanging high-fives with some people on the way to the event . \u201c I just had a great experience , and that is \u2014 I got to meet Darrell Waltrip . That was pretty cool . \u201d\nThe mood also got to Mr. Romney , whose public persona can come across as a bit staid or \u201c square , \u201d but who was clearly energized by his running mate and the responses from overflow crowds at the weekend rallies .\n\u201c I am so happy ! I am so happy to have my teammate now , \u201d he told cheering supporters in Mooresville , N.C. , on Sunday .\nWhen the crowd interrupted Mr. Romney \u2019 s prepared remarks with chants of \u201c U-S-A , U-S-A , \u201d the former Massachusetts governor went off his script to join in and pump his fist in the air as Mr. Ryan did the same .\nWith Mr. Ryan \u2019 s selection \u2014 which came earlier in the season than either of the selections in 2008 \u2014 the Republican ticket now has a second weapon to raise funds and to deploy as a major surrogate , the way the Obama campaign has used Vice President Joseph R. Biden .\n\u201c We \u2019 re going to split up , more often than not , and double our efforts , \u201d Mr. Ryan said in a joint interview with Mr. Romney on Sunday \u2019 s \u201c 60 Minutes. \u201d \u201c It was one against two for a while \u2014 now it \u2019 s two against two . We \u2019 re going to redouble our efforts , and we \u2019 re going to bring a message to the country : \u2018 Here \u2019 s how you get the country back on track . \u2019 \u201d\nAfter the weekend with Mr. Romney , Mr. Ryan will campaign solo at the Iowa State Fair on Monday , getting a chance to test his Midwest appeal when he takes a turn at the fair \u2019 s soapbox , according to Iowa press reports .\nNext weekend , Mr. Ryan will campaign in Florida , home to a large population of seniors \u2014 the kinds of voters Democrats say could be put off by the House Budget Committee chairman \u2019 s plans to alter Medicare . Mr. Romney , however , said any changes wouldn \u2019 t affect current seniors or those close to retiring .\n\u201c What Paul Ryan and I have talked about is saving Medicare , is providing people greater choice in Medicare , making sure it \u2019 s there for current seniors , \u201d he said in the interview .\n\u201c No changes , by the way , for current seniors , or those nearing retirement . But looking for young people down the road and saying , \u2018 We \u2019 re going to give you a bigger choice. \u2019 In America , the nature of this country has been giving people more freedom , more choices . That \u2019 s how we make Medicare work down the road , \u201d he said .\nThe Romney campaign is already grappling with how to square Mr. Ryan \u2019 s extensive voting record and his budget plans with Mr. Romney \u2019 s own stances , with campaign aides stressing to reporters that Mr. Romney is the top of the ticket .\nMr. Ryan also marched in tune with Mr. Romney on the matter of tax returns , saying on \u201c 60 Minutes \u201d that he had turned over \u201c several \u201d years of tax returns to the Romney campaign as part of the vetting process , but that he would publicly release two \u2014 the same number Mr. Romney has .\nThe former Massachusetts governor has received pressure to release more .
