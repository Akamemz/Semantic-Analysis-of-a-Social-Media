    "content": "Donald Trump \u2019 s \u201c big , beautiful wall \u201d has become the trademark of his presidency . It is the promise that more than any other has energized his base , and riled his opponents , and his dogged attachment to it has now brought a large part of the US government to a historic 25 days of partial shutdown .\nThe potency of Trump \u2019 s wall \u2013 for his supporters and his detractors \u2013 stems from its simplicity . Build it tall , build it wide \u2013 he has pledged 1,000 miles of it \u2013 and America will be safe again .\nBut how does that uncomplicated notion compare to the complexity of the border itself ? Taken as a whole , the 1,954 miles of US-Mexican border is a place of astounding diversity \u2013 of terrain , of land use , of city and countryside , of ethnicity . It traverses desert , river , mountain and sea .\nThere is diversity , too , of political view among the 7.5 million people who live in US border counties . Some are ardent backers of Trump \u2019 s wall . Others see their future , and the future of America , as being inextricably linked to that of their neighbor to the south .\nHike 45 minutes past salt marshes and sand dunes , down a lonely beach empty but for occasional tourists on horseback , and you arrive at a steel fence that juts out into the Pacific Ocean .\nThis is where Trump would like to start building his wall should he find the billions of dollars necessary . With the impasse over funding , which prompted the shutdown , administration officials have started to describe what \u2019 s already here , as well as repairs to a two-mile stretch of fence in Calexico 100 miles to the east , as Trump \u2019 s wall . They are not .\nThe length of wall that has been built by Trump since he entered the White House in January 2017 is zero .\nThis is the westernmost point of the US-Mexico border , on the outskirts of San Ysidro , California , a suburb of San Diego that is home to one of the busiest border crossings in the world . Here , the hopes of thousands of migrants who try to make it to the US every year are often dashed .\nThe fence stretches out just to where the waves break , and reaches 15 or 20ft , not the looming 30ft the president has demanded .\nAdjacent to this stretch of fence is Friendship Park , a patch of bi-national ground where loved ones from both sides of the border are allowed to meet . The name is paradoxical given the hostility Trump has engendered since he began his wall obsession .\nOutside Friendship Park \u2013 which only takes 10 visitors at a time \u2013 separated families and friends must make do with waving at each other from a distance . Today the US side is unpopulated save for a lone American , and on the Mexican side a father and young boy are looking northwards . \u201c USA ! \u201d the man says , pointing through a slot for his son \u2019 s benefit .\nFrom San Ysidro , the fence extends for 46 of the next 60 miles of border before finally giving way way to the unforgiving desert . That \u2019 s 46 out of a total of 654 miles of fencing that already exists , much of it in various stages of disrepair .\nThose hundreds of miles of double reinforced fencing and wire meshing were the product of a different era in politics where some degree of bipartisan consensus was possible . They were largely funded by the Secure Fence Act , an immigration compromise reached in 2006 under former president George W Bush .\nCompromise seems unthinkable these days . Trump has laid out a vision of the border that is harshly binary : on his side of the territorial line there is the rule of law , hard work and freedom ; on the other side there is criminality , gangs and drug smuggling .\nThe purpose of the wall , in Trump \u2019 s dystopia , is to prevent America being overrun by the dark forces billowing out of its neighbor . In his Oval Office address to the nation last week he said : \u201c Over the years , thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country and thousands more lives will be lost if we don \u2019 t act right now . \u201d\nBut talk to people in San Ysidro on the American side of the border , and they will tell you about fear and intimidation inflicted on them by the US government .\nIn this town , where 90 % of residents speak Spanish at home , the land south of the border is not equated with lawlessness and evil , but with family , friends and affordable healthcare . If there \u2019 s a dystopia , its not the Mexican one of Trump \u2019 s imagining but the hardened militarism that is fast emerging on the US side replete with helicopters , barricades and armed border patrol .\n\u201c The feeling like you \u2019 re in a war zone is so dramatic the last couple months , \u201d said Lisa Cuestas , head of Casa Familiar , a non-profit that provides social services to San Ysidro .\nMilitarization sped up after the arrival in Tijuana , on the Mexican side , of the caravan of Central American migrants which Trump made so much of during the November midterm elections , calling it an \u201c immigration invasion \u201d . Now members of the caravan are stuck in Mexico and barbed wire has proliferated everywhere like a mutant weed .\nEstrella Flores has family and a job in San Ysidro , working with youth at Casa Familiar , but she lives in Tijuana with her husband and 18-month-old child . Her commute has become hellish since Trump \u2019 s border crackdown .\n\u201c The first time I went across the border where they had the barricades and the barbed wire and the helicopters I was like : \u2018 Am I in a war zone ? What \u2019 s going on here ? I \u2019 m just trying to get to work. \u2019 This isn \u2019 t just a friendly crossing , it could turn very bad , very quickly . \u201d\nSuch views are commonplace across California . A poll conducted by the San Diego Union-Tribune after Trump \u2019 s Oval Office speech found that 56 % of Californians opposed the idea of the wall , compared with 34 % in favor .\nThat \u2019 s not surprising for a state that is a leading force of progressive politics in the US . But California is also significant for having more undocumented migrants than any other state \u2013 2.4 million to Texas \u2019 s 1.7 million .\nClose by is the site of Trump \u2019 s eight wall prototypes . He came here last March to pose for photos in front of the giant slabs of concrete and steel . Now they languish and rust .\nAccording to a later report by the Government Accountability Office , the eight model sections were riddled with design and construction flaws . US Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) tested the slabs and found they can be breached .\nThe first light glistens off the frosted spines of the cholla cacti as 30 volunteers in neon yellow shirts fan out to comb the desert under a pale pink sky . Ely Ortiz , the leader of the \u00c1guilas del desierto ( Eagles of the desert ) rallies his team who have driven through the night from San Diego to Ajo , Arizona . He tells them the last time they searched this area they found 11 sets of remains .\nThe volunteers are joined by a team of cadaver dogs to help in the grim search . A dog called Zabra , whose last job was looking for victims of the California wildfires , is unaccustomed to the desert terrain and has to stop every couple of hundred yards to have barbed spines yanked from her paws .\nUnexploded ordnance dropped by the US military in training is one element of danger for migrants .\nTrump can already count on a metaphorical wall here . This is the most frequently travelled , but also most deadly , migrant corridor across the Sonoran desert .\nWater is scarce and temperatures rise above 120F ( 49C ) in the summer months . The official CBP count records 7,209 deaths along the south-western border in the past 20 years , but that is almost certainly a gross underestimate .\nDespite the human tragedy , federal prosecutors have seen fit to prosecute nine volunteers with the humanitarian group No More Deaths . Their offence : \u201c littering \u201d and driving on restricted roads in the Cabeza Prieta reserve when responding to search and rescue calls . The nine will face trial on Tuesday in a federal district court in Tucson .\n\u201c The irony is that they tell us we can \u2019 t drive here or leave water because it \u2019 s protected wilderness , but meanwhile border patrol drives their trucks and ATVs off road , and fly helicopters and drones wherever they want , \u201d one of the nine , Parker Deighan , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nTrump \u2019 s policy of \u201c prevention through deterrence \u201d is forcing migrants to take greater risks . As legal admission to the US through official ports of entry becomes ever more restricted , migrants are being \u201c funneled \u201d away from fenced sections of the border towards the desert .\nOne of the only towns in the area is Ajo . Today it \u2019 s a ghost town , as its copper mine closed in the 1980s . Since then most residents have switched to the main local job-provider : border security .\nAjo Samaritans recently gathered in the plaza for a vigil to honor the lives of the people who succumbed in the surrounding wilderness . They laid out 118 white crosses , one for each of those lost in 2018 . Those whose bones had yet to be identified were called desconocido \u2013 unknown .\nBefore Trump decided to throw a bone to his voter base during the midterm election campaign last year by sending more than 5,000 active-duty military troops to the border , the gate at Lukeville port of entry in Arizona was almost always open . American tourists , seeking to flee the winter , would blithely pour through heading for the beach at Rocky Point , an hour \u2019 s drive south on the Mexican coast .\nTrump \u2019 s border clampdown hasn \u2019 t only cramped the style of beach-lovers as they pass through the now half-closed gate . Over the past two months , the US military have brought with them concertina wire and a double stack of shipping containers , ready to be used to block the entry as an impenetrable barricade should another caravan \u2013 or \u201c immigrant invasion \u201d \u2013 arise .\nNot that there \u2019 s any sign of that . Most of the traffic through Lukeville is commercial and passenger , and the main concern of federal agents is not migrants but drugs .\nIt is one of the myths propagated by the Trump administration that America is awash with drugs that have flooded into the country through lack of a wall . In his Oval Office address last week , Trump said that \u201c the border wall would very quickly pay for itself \u201d by halting the flow of illicit drugs \u2013 implying that narcotics came into the US through sections of open border .\nNot true . In fact , most illegal drugs are hidden away in cars and tractor-trailers as they pass over international bridges and through small ports of entry like Lukeville . The 2018 annual drug threat assessment of the Drug Enforcement Administration points out that for drugs like heroin , up to 90 % enters the country through ports of entry .\nAnother contradiction is that Trump insists on immigrants showing up legally at border crossings , yet for those who do so he has made it increasingly difficult for them to claim asylum . In November the Trump administration announced it would deny asylum to anyone who tries to cross the border illegally , though a federal court has since temporarily blocked the new regulation .\nMeanwhile , a new system of \u201c metering \u201d has been introduced that amounts to a federal slowdown at legal entry points . As a result , growing numbers of increasingly desperate families , most coming from the trio of violence-ridden Central American countries \u2013 Honduras , El Salvador and Guatemala \u2013 have been left stranded in Mexico .\nAt Lukeville , asylum seekers following Trump \u2019 s orders and showing up legally at the port of entry have simply been turned away . \u2588\u2588\u2588 spoke to Alberto ( not his real name ) in a shelter on the Mexican side . In November , he presented himself at Lukeville and asked for asylum .\nThe supervising agent there told him to leave , claiming it was out of hours . Alberto was left on the streets where , days before , mafia members had told him they would kill him if they saw him again .\nVolunteer groups working with immigrants protested , and CBP apologized . Now when asked if they accept claims , Lukeville agents repeat the official mantra : \u201c Asylum seekers are being accepted at all ports of entry . \u201d\nThat doesn \u2019 t mean claims will be successful . Alberto did try a second time to have his claim heard . He will testify before an immigration judge in two weeks \u2019 time .\nThere is no place along the border that more strongly rebuts Trump \u2019 s dystopian vision than El Paso . The Texas city is so intertwined with Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez across the Rio Grande to the south that they are virtually inseparable .\nBetween them they are home to almost 3 million people \u2013 roughly the size of Chicago . About 20,000 pedestrians and more than 35,000 vehicles cross into El Paso from Mexico every day , many to work , others to go to school or shop .\nIt \u2019 s two-way traffic : Americans in El Paso also regularly cross into Ju\u00e1rez to visit family or experience the nightlife .\nEighty per cent of El Paso \u2019 s residents are of Hispanic origin , and a quarter of the city \u2019 s population was born outside the US .\nMary Gonzalez , the Democratic representative for El Paso in the Texas house , said : \u201c It \u2019 s a very generous , diverse , multinational , welcoming and loving community . That human component is left out when the border is discussed . \u201d\nRetail sales in the US side of the twin cities are estimated to generate $ 10bn a year , with a fifth attributed to Mexican shoppers .\nAgainst that reality , Trump has painted a picture of rampant crime and the threat of violence being imported into the US . That \u2019 s a particularly loaded argument for El Paso , given the historically high murder rate in neighboring Ju\u00e1rez .\nLast year saw it rise again to almost 200 people killed each month . Yet crime in El Paso on the US side of the border remains relatively low . Violent crimes have fallen sharply from about 6,500 in 1993 to around 3,000 today .\nThat \u2019 s why Beto O \u2019 Rourke , the rising star of the Democratic party and former Congress representative for this strongly left-leaning city , lauded El Paso as the \u201c safest city in America \u201d as part of his senatorial election campaign in November . ( His claim wasn \u2019 t entirely accurate \u2013 factcheckers found it was only \u201c half true \u201d . )\nO \u2019 Rourke failed in his bid to unseat Ted Cruz in the midterm elections , but the fact that he came within three points of doing so suggests that Texans might be more open to his liberal stance on immigration and less in step with Trump than is often assumed .\nOpinion polls show that while most Texans are concerned about immigrants entering the country illegally , most are also opposed to Trump \u2019 s wall .\nSome people go as far as to suggest that El Paso could be a harbinger of things to come for the whole of America . As Josiah Heyman , director of the Center for Inter-American and Border Studies , put it : \u201c El Paso is a place where there is a vision of the future , where people , instead of being part of a closed defensive community , are able to find the joy of relating to others . \u201d\nTravel 40 miles east from El Paso along the Rio Grande to Tornillo , and it feels a world away from the big city . Vast open areas are filled with orchards , and pecan nut and dairy farms .\nOf the 1,317 miles of border with no fence or human barrier , much of it lies along the 1,248 miles of Rio Grande . The river serves as the demarcation line between the two countries all the way from El Paso to the Gulf of Mexico .\nPowerful currents , towering canyons and cliffs that in the Big Bend section rise to 50ft reduce the need for a solid barrier through much of the river \u2019 s trajectory .\nStill , Trump has his eye on the Rio Grande for his wall . Of the $ 5.7bn he is demanding from Congress , a sizable chunk would go towards building more than 100 miles of wall along the river .\nHere just outside Tornillo , the existing fence that runs west to Sunland Park in New Mexico has a 10-mile gap in it . Despite the lack of an artificial barrier , most locals go about their daily routine without fuss .\nMiguel Alvarez , who has lived close to the border for 25 years , said the arrival of the fence has made precious little difference . \u201c You still see small groups of people passing through just like they did before any fencing , \u201d he said .\nA farmer who didn \u2019 t want to reveal his name said he would feel more comfortable if the gap in the fencing were closed . \u201c I haven \u2019 t had any issues with people coming across , but you never know , \u201d he said .\nTornillo itself fell under the national spotlight after the Trump administration chose the Marcelino Serna port of entry south of the town to house thousands of unaccompanied minors in a tent-like facility . It was meant to be temporary , designed to help deal with hundreds of children who had been separated from their families as a result of Trump \u2019 s crackdown on border crossers .\nBut it rapidly grew , to up to 2,400 beds , becoming the face of the brutality of Trump \u2019 s policy of tearing families apart as a form of deterrent .\nIn November , a government watchdog warned that conditions in the tent city were putting children at risk , and since then the numbers have been reduced until the last teenager was transferred out of the facility last week . As far as locals are concerned , its closure couldn \u2019 t happen fast enough .\nThey are eager for things to get back to normal . Or at least as close to what passes as normal these days .\n\u2022 This article was amended on 15 January 2019 because the fence is not unbroken for the 46 miles from San Ysidro to the desert , as an earlier version said .",

The Texas city is so intertwined with Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez across the Rio Grande to the south that they are virtually inseparable.\n\nBetween them they are home to almost 3 million people \u2013 roughly the size of Chicago. About 20,000 pedestrians and more than 35,000 vehicles cross into El Paso from Mexico every day, many to work, others to go to school or shop.\n\nIt\u2019s two-way traffic: Americans in El Paso also regularly cross into Ju\u00e1rez to visit family or experience the nightlife.\n\nEighty per cent of El Paso\u2019s residents are of Hispanic origin, and a quarter of the city\u2019s population was born outside the US.\n\nMary Gonzalez, the Democratic representative for El Paso in the Texas house, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a very generous, diverse, multinational, welcoming and loving community. That human component is left out when the border is discussed.\u201d\n\nRetail sales in the US side of the twin cities are estimated to generate $10bn a year, with a fifth attributed to Mexican shoppers.\n\nAgainst that reality, Trump has painted a picture of rampant crime and the threat of violence being imported into the US. That\u2019s a particularly loaded argument for El Paso, given the historically high murder rate in neighboring Ju\u00e1rez.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sister Cities, a mural painted by Los Dos, symbolises the bond between El Paso and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez. Photograph: Paul Ratje/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLast year saw it rise again to almost 200 people killed each month. Yet crime in El Paso on the US side of the border remains relatively low. Violent crimes have fallen sharply from about 6,500 in 1993 to around 3,000 today.\n\nThat\u2019s why Beto O\u2019Rourke, the rising star of the Democratic party and former Congress representative for this strongly left-leaning city, lauded El Paso as the \u201csafest city in America\u201d as part of his senatorial election campaign in November. (His claim wasn\u2019t entirely accurate \u2013 factcheckers found it was only \u201chalf true\u201d.)\n\nO\u2019Rourke failed in his bid to unseat Ted Cruz in the midterm elections, but the fact that he came within three points of doing so suggests that Texans might be more open to his liberal stance on immigration and less in step with Trump than is often assumed.\n\nOpinion polls show that while most Texans are concerned about immigrants entering the country illegally, most are also opposed to Trump\u2019s wall.\n\nSome people go as far as to suggest that El Paso could be a harbinger of things to come for the whole of America. As Josiah Heyman, director of the Center for Inter-American and Border Studies, put it: \u201cEl Paso is a place where there is a vision of the future, where people, instead of being part of a closed defensive community, are able to find the joy of relating to others.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People cool off in the Rio Grande, just over the border from Laredo, Texas.

Vast open areas are filled with orchards, and pecan nut and dairy farms.\n\nUS border patrol vehicles keep a watchful eye.\n\nOf the 1,317 miles of border with no fence or human barrier, much of it lies along the 1,248 miles of Rio Grande. The river serves as the demarcation line between the two countries all the way from El Paso to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nPowerful currents, towering canyons and cliffs that in the Big Bend section rise to 50ft reduce the need for a solid barrier through much of the river\u2019s trajectory.\n\nStill, Trump has his eye on the Rio Grande for his wall. Of the $5.7bn he is demanding from Congress, a sizable chunk would go towards building more than 100 miles of wall along the river.\n\nHere just outside Tornillo, the existing fence that runs west to Sunland Park in New Mexico has a 10-mile gap in it. Despite the lack of an artificial barrier, most locals go about their daily routine without fuss.\n\nMiguel Alvarez, who has lived close to the border for 25 years, said the arrival of the fence has made precious little difference. \u201cYou still see small groups of people passing through just like they did before any fencing,\u201d he said.\n\nA farmer who didn\u2019t want to reveal his name said he would feel more comfortable if the gap in the fencing were closed. \u201cI haven\u2019t had any issues with people coming across, but you never know,\u201d he said.\n\nTornillo itself fell under the national spotlight after the Trump administration chose the Marcelino Serna port of entry south of the town to house thousands of unaccompanied minors in a tent-like facility. It was meant to be temporary, designed to help deal with hundreds of children who had been separated from their families as a result of Trump\u2019s crackdown on border crossers.\n\nBut it rapidly grew, to up to 2,400 beds, becoming the face of the brutality of Trump\u2019s policy of tearing families apart as a form of deterrent.\n\nIn November, a government watchdog warned that conditions in the tent city were putting children at risk, and since then the numbers have been reduced until the last teenager was transferred out of the facility last week. As far as locals are concerned, its closure couldn\u2019t happen fast enough.\n\nThey are eager for things to get back to normal. Or at least as close to what passes as normal these days.\n\n\u2022 This article was amended on 15 January 2019 because the fence is not unbroken for the 46 miles from San Ysidro to the desert, as an earlier version said.",
