Or so the media and politicians tell us.\n\nThe \"cliff\" is a series of tax increases and budget cuts that automatically go into effect Jan. 1 unless Congress acts.\n\nWill Congress act?\n\nIt will! I see the future: The politicians will meet and fret and hold press conferences and predict disaster. Then they'll reach a deal.\n\nIt will just postpone the reckoning, but they'll congratulate themselves, and the media will move on.\n\nAmerica, however, continues to go broke.\n\n\"They're not going to admit that we're bankrupt, and they won't admit that we're on the verge of a major, major change in our society,\" says Rep.

Trillion-dollar deficits are more terrible.\n\nCuts of $110 billion would even be good for us because it would keep money in private hands, away from the bloated and freedom-killing bureaucracy.\n\n\"When government spending is about $3.8 trillion, you're going to cut $100 billion?
