    "content": "There is officially only one mayor left in the 2020 presidential race \u2014 and it is the one who runs a city of 100,000 rather than the chief executive of the biggest city in the United States . On Friday , New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio ended his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination \u2014 leaving us now with 18 major candidates remaining , per \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s definition .\nHowever , the list of candidates with realistic shots at winning the nomination may be even shorter than that ; just 10 candidates met the polling and donor thresholds to participate in last week \u2019 s Democratic debate in Houston . And de Blasio was not among them , nor did it seem possible for him to qualify for the next debate , in Ohio in October . As of July , only 6,700 people had donated to his campaign ( debaters need 130,000 ) , and he has only hit 2 percent support in a handful of polls all year long ( none of which are counted by the Democratic National Committee for debate qualification ) . In short , it \u2019 s no mystery why de Blasio called it quits .\nDe Blasio was always an extreme long shot . He entered the race quite late , on May 16 \u2014 after more than 20 other major candidates had declared and the field was already drawing headlines for being historically saturated . In fact , only one successful presidential nominee since 1976 ( Bill Clinton ) kicked off his campaign later than de Blasio did . And although de Blasio was arguably one of the most progressive candidates in the field \u2014 having brought universal pre-K and other liberal reforms to the five boroughs \u2014 he was crowded out of the primary \u2019 s left lane by the likes of Sens . Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren , who combined for 56 percent support among \u201c very liberal \u201d voters in the most recent Quinnipiac poll ( de Blasio had less than 1 percent ) .\nBut probably de Blasio \u2019 s biggest problem was simply that Democratic voters did not like him , which is quite an unusual place to be among voters of one \u2019 s own party . In an average of national polls of 2020 candidates \u2019 favorability from May , de Blasio was the only candidate at the time whom more voters viewed unfavorably than favorably ( his net favorability rating \u2014 favorable rating minus unfavorable rating \u2014 was -1 ) . That \u2019 s especially bad because de Blasio wasn \u2019 t some little-known candidate ; 46 percent of Democrats were able to form an opinion of him . All other candidates who were at least as well-known had net favorability ratings of +21 or better !\nIt is very difficult to win a presidential nomination when you are well-known but not well-liked among voters in your party early in the campaign . Only one candidate has done so since 1980 \u2014 President Trump , who went from a -42 net favorability rating among Republicans in May 2015 to a +28 net favorability rating that September . But Trump had the advantage of tons of earned media coverage , something no future candidate could bank on . De Blasio certainly didn \u2019 t get it , appearing in less than 1 percent of cable-news clips the week of Sept. 8 , for example . And unsurprisingly , his net favorability rating failed to improve ; in fact , it actually dropped over the course of the campaign ( it was -6 in our average of August polls ) .\nOne group with whom de Blasio became especially unpopular this summer ?
