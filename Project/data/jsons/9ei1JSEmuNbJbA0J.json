    "content": "In a very famous ( and possibly apocryphal ) quote , Lyndon Johnson said upon signing the 1964 Civil Rights Act that the Democrats had lost the South for a generation . And there 's little doubt that the Republicans immediately saw a path to a new majority . That realignment took more than a generation to gradually happen , but happen it did . The GOP marched through one election after another burning down every Southern Democratic stronghold in its wake .\nAnd the Democrats have been bemoaning their Lost Cause ever since . For decades it was an article of faith that the only way for the Democrats to achieve a real majority again would be to recapture that Southern white vote . They agreed that they had to only nominate sons of the South who could speak the lingo . And they had to ensure that they never again spoke ill of guns , only spoke ill of gays and always praised God as if every day was an evangelical revival meeting . This was best articulated by a strategist by the name of Mudcat Saunders who spelled it out as clearly as anyone 's ever done it :\nSouthNow : What \u2019 s the prescription for Democrats ? Mudcat : There \u2019 s only one prescription and that \u2019 s tolerance . I \u2019 m a white , southern male who hunts . I \u2019 m a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans , which has two black members , by the way . I don \u2019 t know how many northern Democrats who have tolerance for my kind .

It \u2019 s a wall of straw . Inside every rural Republican is a Democrat trying to get out . Saunders , who has worked on the campaigns of Mark Warner , John Edwards , and Bob Graham , thinks that if Democrats ease up on the culture stuff they can win in the South : `` We \u2019 ve got an affection for big guns and fast cars .
