The Supreme Court is expected to decide the issue by the end of the current term in June .\nThe issue also includes the religious conscience of public clerks who issue marriage licenses , doctors or anesthesiologists who may tangentially participate in abortion procedures , or any other professionals who might object to participating in events that offend their deeply held religious beliefs .\nBut since Indiana became the 20th state to pass its version of a religious freedom restoration act last week , a widespread chorus of critics has objected to the new state law \u2013 or at least the perceived intentions behind it .\nBelieving it may indeed permit discrimination against lesbian and gay Americans , CEOs such as Apple \u2019 s Tim Cook , the governor of Connecticut , the mayor of Seattle , and organizations such as the NCAA and Gen Con have begun to rethink , or even curtail , their business relationships with the state .\n\u201c These bills rationalize injustice by pretending to defend something many of us hold dear , \u201d Mr. Cook , who is gay , wrote in an opinion piece in The Washington Post on Sunday . \u201c They go against the very principles our nation was founded on , and they have the potential to undo decades of progress toward greater equality . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s a far cry from the overwhelming bipartisan consensus that first accompanied the original Religious Freedom Restoration Act in 1993 . More than two decades ago , the federal version passed unanimously by voice vote in the House \u2013 yes , that \u2019 s right , unanimously \u2013 and with only three nays in the Senate before President Bill Clinton signed it into law .\nAt the time , a coalition of civil rights liberals and religious conservatives both sought to \u201c restore \u201d religious freedoms curtailed by the Supreme Court in the 1980s . The high court ruled that the nation \u2019 s general laws , such as its prohibitions against drugs , trumped Native American use of peyote in religious ceremonies , and allowed the expansion of federal projects onto sacred land .\nThe federal law sought to protect religious minorities , restoring a \u201c strict scrutiny \u201d test that still provides the basic RFRA template , scholars say . Like Indiana \u2019 s , these laws forbid the government from placing a \u201c substantial burden \u201d on the free exercise of religion unless it can demonstrate a \u201c compelling government interest \u201d to do so . The burdens must also be the \u201c least restrictive means \u201d to achieve this interest .\nIndeed , after the Supreme Court ruled the federal statute did not apply to the states , more liberal states like Connecticut , Rhode Island , and Illinois were the first to pass state RFRA laws .\nBut even then , the looming issue of gay rights and same-sex marriage began to tear apart the bipartisan coalition . Cases concerning the right of landlords to refuse leases for gay couples and the stirrings of legalizing gay marriage in Hawaii led the liberals to withdraw their support .\n\u201c Those two developments started to change the minds of civil rights groups on the question of religious freedom , \u201d says Nelson Tebbe , professor of law and religion at Brooklyn Law School in New York . \u201c They started to worry that religious freedom could be used not just a shield for religious minorities against the general laws , but as a sword by religious conservatives who wanted exemptions from civil rights laws . \u201d\nSuch religious freedom legislation does not necessarily exempt religious people from nondiscrimination laws , scholars say . They simply put the burden on the state to show a \u201c compelling government interest \u201d when curtailing deeply held religious beliefs \u2013 and discrimination may very well be one .\n\u201c As a society , we do that , \u201d says Mr. Goldfeder . \u201c At some point we say , as we said with Bob Jones University , listen , maybe it \u2019 s your religious belief to discriminate on the basis of race , but that \u2019 s no longer acceptable . \u201d\n\u201c At some point we come to the idea that we decide as a society that there \u2019 s a compelling government interest that we don \u2019 t discriminate anymore , \u201d he continues . \u201c LGBT is not a protected class everywhere \u2013 though I think it should be \u2013 and the question we \u2019 re butting up against is exactly that : At what point does the line change , and we say , you can no longer do this ?
