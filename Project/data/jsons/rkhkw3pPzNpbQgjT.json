    "content": "Australia 's catastrophic brush fire season comes as the country continues to insist on a climate loophole that critics say would undermine the Paris Agreement 's objective of keeping global warming to relatively safe levels .\nThe fires that began in September were the result of record heat and drought that scientists say is consistent with climate change \u2014 and likely to worsen if the world misses its chance this decade to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius . Blazes in New South Wales and other states so far have killed 20 people and up to half a billion animals , leading to fear of extinctions .\nBut while polls showed growing alarm about climate change , Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison waited until December to acknowledge the link to `` climate change , along with many other factors . '' He skipped U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres ' climate summit in New York in September despite being in the United States , and his representative ducked out of last month 's U.N. climate conference in Madrid days before it ended .\nAnd while Australia long has been seen as an unambitious presence in the U.N. climate arena , this year it became an outright pariah . That 's because Morrison 's government in the last year suddenly has insisted it plans to use a carbon accounting loophole from the expiring Kyoto Protocol agreement to fulfill its already modest Paris commitments , promising domestic audiences that the accounting trick would limit the pressure the deal would place on Australia 's coal and gas exporting sectors .\nThat message angered progressive countries at the Madrid confab determined to see progress toward the 1.5 C goal .\n`` It 's apparent that there are countries that have some legitimate concerns about how to agree and others who do n't have that , '' Costa Rica Minister of Environment and Energy Carlos Manuel Rodr\u00edguez told E & E News in Madrid .\nAt a meeting in San Jos\u00e9 , Costa Rica , before the Madrid talks , Rodr\u00edguez and representatives from 30 other countries \u2014 small islands , progressive developing countries and European Union members \u2014 endorsed a set of principles for good carbon accounting . The targets were Australia 's carryover proposal and Brazil 's demands that Kyoto Protocol credits be eligible for trade under the Paris Agreement and for permission to double-count emissions reductions .\nAs talks in the Spanish capital entered their tense final day , Rodr\u00edguez broke from usual practice and called out Australia , Brazil and the United States by name during a press conference . He later told E & E News that he regretted `` naming and shaming '' the trio but asserted that proposals like Australia 's to use old Kyoto allowances toward a new Paris pledge would threaten the environmental integrity of the deal and put the 1.5 C goal further out of reach .\n`` A very bad agreement is not acceptable , '' he said . `` A clear understanding that we have these pending issues and that we will discuss them throughout the year is something that can be considered . ''\nBut Australia says there 's nothing to discuss . Morrison and his government hold that Australia has the absolute right as a sovereign country to design its nationally determined contribution to Paris as it sees fit . And Morrison rejects charges that it 's unambitious .\n`` What I 'm saying is Australia is meeting and beating our emissions reduction targets , '' he told reporters when asked about the climate talks at a Melbourne press conference in December .\nMorrison 's boast stands in contrast to other analytics . A ranking of 61 major economies that came out last month showed Australia with the least protective climate policies .\nIndeed , Australia 's claim to current climate action has its roots in the past \u2014 specifically , high rates of deforestation in 1990 , which added a whopping 131.6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere before leveling off , according to an analysis by Climate Analytics .\nAfter it agreed to the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 , Australia accepted a target of keeping emissions growth to no more than 8 % above 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012 \u2014 an easy task given that the 1990 deforestation bump artificially raised its baseline 24 % above an average year . Australia made the right to carry over the extra allowances a condition of joining a second Kyoto commitment period .\nAnd now the country wants to do the same for Paris .\nAustralia pledged in Paris to cut its emissions between 26 % and 28 % below 2005 levels by 2030 but is currently on track for a 7 % cut , according to Climate Analytics .\nMorrison 's government released estimates based on land use late last year that provided a higher estimate for 1990 deforestation \u2014 raising the 1990 baseline above what Australia had claimed before . If it gets credit for Kyoto allowances , Australia need only reduce emissions 14.3 % below 2005 levels to claim reductions of 26 % .\nMost of Australia 's projected reductions are related to land use , not energy or industrial emissions , which are projected to remain more or less flat between now and 2030 . By contrast , last year 's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report indicates that the 1.5 C goal would require the world to cut emissions in half by 2030 .\nIt 's also an open question how the 350 million metric tons of CO2 released during this year 's Australian fire season figures into any of this accounting .\nEven though Australia 's loophole is globally unpopular , it 's unclear how it can be stopped .
