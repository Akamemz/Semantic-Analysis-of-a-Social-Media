Recent bombardment of this last , shrinking rebel enclave has forced one million people from their homes . Syrian government forces backed by Russia and Iran have captured nearly half of the enclave since renewing an offensive last December with relentless bombing .\nThat forced into even tighter quarters the 3 million people in Idlib \u2013 among them Islamist militants , including former Al Qaeda affiliates , trucked there as part of cease-fire deals brokered when other rebel-held regions were defeated .\nThe latest United Nations situation report for northwest Syria , published Monday , notes : \u201c Inadequate land for the formation of new camps and sites leave many new IDPs [ internally displaced people ] in overcrowded conditions without formalized camp support . \u201d\nIt adds that , \u201c access to food has become an increasing concern. \u201d Indeed , some 1.5 million people in Idlib depend on food aid , and in January alone , 1,227 trucks crossed the border with supplies from Turkey , the largest number in seven years .\nFelipe Dana/AP A boy walks out of a heavily damaged building where he is currently living , in Idlib , Syria , March 12 , 2020 . Idlib is the last urban area still under opposition control in Syria , located in a shrinking rebel enclave in the northwestern province of the same name . Syria \u2019 s civil war , which entered its 10th year March 15 , 2020 , has shrunk in geographical scope \u2013 focusing on this corner of the country \u2013 but the misery wreaked by the conflict has not diminished .\nA tenuous cease-fire brokered March 5 by Turkey and Russia , both of which have troops deployed in and around the province , still holds . But the U.N. notes that even before the December offensive began , the population of Idlib was \u201c already extremely vulnerable . \u201d\nThe World Health Organization says Syria \u2019 s health system \u2013 especially after years in which government and allied forces targeted health infrastructure behind rebel lines \u2013 is \u201c on its knees. \u201d Beyond Syria \u2019 s borders , neighbors Turkey , Lebanon , and Jordan have absorbed millions of refugees .\n\u201c In Syria you have this perfect storm . When we needed the health system the most , it was bombed . When people were supposed to be able to quarantine and distance themselves , they had to flee their houses to temporary , crowded camps , \u201d says Mr. Egeland .\n\u201c So as bad as it is in Italy and China and increasingly in the rest of Europe , I can not see why it would not be 10 times worse when you have none of the mitigating measures that we have , \u201d he says .\nBut the solution that can ease the impact is still within reach , if donors can see the need for a holistic approach .\n\u201c What can we do ? Water and sanitation . It \u2019 s not rocket science . It \u2019 s a logistical challenge , \u201d says Mr. Egeland , whose 14,000 field workers with NRC aim to double to 4 million the number of people across multiple war zones they reach with water and sanitation .\nThat means more latrines , and 10 times more running water points for washing , and decongesting camps by tripling or quadrupling the space devoted to displaced people . It means expanding health care , public hygiene campaigns , and building quarantine facilities \u2013 all actions the NRC says may keep the virus at bay in the Middle East , and so make it less likely to persist there as a threat to the rest of the world .\n\u201c You have 6 million refugees from Syria , 6 million internally displaced in Syria \u2013 including a million recently in Idlib \u2013 another 1.5 million displaced in Iraq , all of them living in oppressively unsustainable conditions that , by all indications , \u201d are consistent with transmission of the virus , says Julien Barnes-Dacey , head of the Middle East and North Africa program at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Brussels .\nAnother key factor is the governments of Syria , Lebanon , and Iraq , all \u201c hollowed out \u201d over recent years by multiple layers of crises and short on leadership and resources , says Mr. Barnes-Dacey .\nBut that very concern may be causing some shift in regional thinking , with Exhibit A being unexpected support for Iran \u2013 epicenter of the virus in the Middle East \u2013 by the United Arab Emirates and some other Persian Gulf states , despite long-simmering tensions with Iran .\nThe Islamic Republic is host to 9 out of 10 of the 21,000-plus confirmed cases of COVID-19 across the Middle East , and a number of its leadership elite are among more than 1,800 citizens who have died .
