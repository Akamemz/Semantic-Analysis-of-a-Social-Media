But before it could go into effect , Texas and 25 other states filed a lawsuit seeking to block the program .\nA federal judge in Texas issued an injunction , and that action was upheld by a federal appeals court panel last year .\nThe justices \u2019 decision on Tuesday to weigh in on the immigration case means the high court will be examining yet another politically-sensitive controversy in a presidential election year .\nThe justices are already expected to decide by late June cases examining state-imposed abortion regulations , the drafting of voting districts , use of race in college admissions , and whether public unions can require nonmembers to pay fees for collective bargaining .\nSpecifically at issue in the case is whether a federal judge in Texas acted properly in issuing an injunction to block the president \u2019 s executive action .\nIn an important signal of the potential magnitude of the dispute , the high court instructed the lawyers to also address the most fundamental question raised in the litigation \u2013 whether President Obama \u2019 s unilateral action to advance his immigration program violates the \u201c take care \u201d clause of the US Constitution .\nArticle II of the Constitution sets out the duties of the president . It includes the requirement that the president \u201c shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed . \u201d\nThe issue is whether federal immigration statutes , as passed by Congress and signed into law by the president , permit the kind of broad discretion for unilateral executive action claimed by the Obama administration .\nLawyers for the administration and for a group of undocumented immigrants who would benefit from the new immigration policies had asked the high court to lift the injunction and allow the Obama immigration program to take effect .\nThey argue that the complaining states do not have the necessary legal standing to bring their lawsuit . They also argue that the administration did not exceed its authority in adopting regulations that would grant deferred deportation status to several million undocumented immigrants and provide them with work permits .\nRepublicans accuse the president of using his executive authority to usurp legislative power the Constitution assigns to Congress . They say existing immigration laws bar the Obama administration from deciding for itself that large categories of people should be granted special immigration status and authorization to work .\nAdministration officials and Democratic supporters argue that US immigration laws grant expansive discretion to federal officials to decide how best to enforce those laws .
