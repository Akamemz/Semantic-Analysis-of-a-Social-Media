Mr. Trump has cited continuing I.R.S . audits of his taxes in refusing to release his returns .\nWhen Mr. Trump was asked on ABC \u2019 s \u201c Good Morning America \u201d whether he thought voters had a right to see his returns , he replied , \u201c I don \u2019 t think they do . \u201d\nMr. Trump added of his taxes : \u201c It \u2019 s under routine audit . When the audit ends , I \u2019 m going to present them . That should be before the election . I hope it \u2019 s before the election . \u201d\nBut when asked by the interviewer , George Stephanopoulos , what effective tax rate he pays , Mr. Trump said , \u201c It \u2019 s none of your business. \u201d He added , \u201c You \u2019 ll see it when I release , but I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible . \u201d\nThe release of tax returns bedeviled Republicans during the 2012 presidential election , when Mitt Romney delayed releasing his until September .

Mr. Trump has said that Mr. Romney erred in waiting so long to release his taxes and should have done so sooner .\nFor many years , Mr. Trump \u2019 s wealth has been a moving target , subject to much estimation , debate and even litigation .\nLast summer , when Mr. Trump filed the personal financial disclosures required of presidential candidates , his campaign released a statement saying that he was worth more than \u201c TEN BILLION DOLLARS , \u201d capitalizing the outsize figure . When the 92-page document became public , the disclosures by Mr. Trump indicated that he had at least $ 1.4 billion in assets , including his real estate developments and golf clubs .\nFortune recently pegged his worth at $ 3.72 billion .
