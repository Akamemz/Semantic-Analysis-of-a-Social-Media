    "content": "Cairo ( CNN ) Farrah El Dibany thought something was odd . Her Tuesday EgyptAir flight was taking too long to get from Alexandria to Cairo , the plane was headed out over the Mediterranean Sea , and then , crew members began taking passengers ' passports .\n`` When you fly to Cairo , you do n't cross the sea , '' she said . `` Then one of the cabin crew told us , 'We are hijacked . We 're being hijacked . ' There was a lot of panic and crying on the plane . They did n't tell us anything more . They did n't say what he wants or where we 're heading , nothing . We were just kidnapped . ''\nEl Dibany 's flight had been hijacked by a man who officials described as `` unstable '' after he held the passengers and crew hostage with a fake explosive belt , forcing the plane to divert to Cyprus -- apparently over issues involving his ex-wife , a Cypriot . He also has a criminal record ,\n`` It was very horrifying to be in this situation , '' El Dibany said .\nThe incident ended relatively peacefully Tuesday when the plane 's crew and passengers left the aircraft and authorities took the hijacker into custody .\n`` The hijacker has just been arrested , '' Cyprus government spokesman Nikos Christodoulides said on Twitter , adding a few minutes later , `` All passengers and crew are safe . ''\nCyprus state television showed video of the hijacker , wearing a white shirt , being led away by a phalanx of police . Presidential spokesman Alaa Yousuf identified the Egyptian man as Seif El Din Mustafa .\nAn early report that the hijacker was armed with explosives was false , said Alexandros Zinon , permanent secretary for the Cypriot Ministry of Foreign Affairs .\nShortly before news of the arrest , video of the aircraft , which was parked on the tarmac at Cyprus ' Larnaca International Airport , showed people leaving the plane , one through a cockpit window .\nThe incident began when Mustafa allegedly hijacked the EgyptAir flight because of his ex-wife , officials said Tuesday .
