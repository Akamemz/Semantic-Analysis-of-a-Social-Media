    "content": "As presidential candidate and former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg has risen in Democratic primary polls \u2014 he \u2019 s currently in third place nationally according to RealClearPolitics \u2019 polling average \u2014 he \u2019 s faced increasing scrutiny about his past .\nIn particular , Bloomberg has been challenged about allegations of sexism and sexual harassment in the workplace , and has been questioned about a number of lawsuits filed against him and his eponymous company regarding those issues . On Saturday , a new investigative report from the Washington Post \u2019 s Michael Kranish once again surfaced those concerns .\nDrawing from previously unreleased court documents , depositions , and interviews with witnesses , Kranish \u2019 s reporting details vulgar and misogynistic comments Bloomberg allegedly made toward women . The report also features a former employee who says he heard one of the most notorious accusations against Bloomberg himself \u2014 that the former mayor once told a pregnant subordinate to \u201c kill \u201d her unborn child ( Bloomberg has denied saying this ) .\nAnd in a week in which Bloomberg was accused of being racist due to resurfaced comments about the stop-and-frisk program he once championed , Kranish \u2019 s work also highlights comments Bloomberg allegedly made that are startlingly degrading to African Americans ; one lawsuit claims Bloomberg once advised an employee to find \u201c some black who doesn \u2019 t have to speak English \u201d to work as a nanny for her .\nMost of the accusations are from decades ago , when Bloomberg worked at the financial information services company he founded and that made him a billionaire . But they \u2019 ve become newly relevant as he has begun to surge in national polls and emerged as a real contender for the nomination \u2014 particularly if he performs well on Super Tuesday , when a third of the primary \u2019 s national delegates will be up for grabs across 16 contests .\nThe allegations contained in the Post \u2019 s reporting \u2014 many of which Bloomberg has denied \u2014 are likely to join a list of concerns that have been raised by both his progressive rivals and some Democratic voters about his personal and political history . These critics claim his past stances on stop-and-frisk , his unprecedented use of wealth to buy name recognition , and the allegations he faces about his treatment of women mean that he is fundamentally out of touch with the Democratic Party .\nThese allegations could also intensify calls for Bloomberg to release former employees from nondisclosure agreements made regarding the lawsuits , something Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren called for in December .\nWhether these concerns are shared by the moderate voters whom Bloomberg is targeting with his campaign is an open question , however .\nBloomberg has been accused of some shocking behavior toward women\nMuch of what the Post lays out in its investigation of Bloomberg \u2019 s inappropriate conduct has been reported on before , but there are some critical new details .\nSekiko Sakai Garrison , a top salesperson who worked for Bloomberg in his business information firm , sued him and his company in the \u2019 90s for workplace discrimination . The Post published some of the details of the complaints mentioned in the lawsuits :\nOn April 11 , 1995 at approximately 11:20 a.m. , Bloomberg was having a photograph taken with two female Company salespeople and a group of N.Y.U . Business School students , in the company snack area . When Bloomberg noticed Garrison standing nearby , he asked , \u201c Why didn \u2019 t they ask you to be in the picture ? I guess they saw your face. \u201d Continuing his penchant for ridiculing recently married women in his employ , Bloomberg asked plaintiff , \u201c How \u2019 s married life ? You married ? \u201d Plaintiff responded that her marriage was great and was going to get better in a few months : that she was pregnant , and the baby was due the following September . He responded to her \u201c Kill it ! \u201d Plaintiff asked Bloomberg to repeat himself , and again he said , \u201c Kill it ! \u201d and muttered , \u201c Great ! Number 16 ! \u201d suggesting to plaintiff his unhappiness that sixteen women in the Company had maternity-related status . Then he walked away .\nBloomberg has denied under oath the accusations that he told her to \u201c kill \u201d the unborn child , and he reached a confidential settlement with Garrison .\nBut the Post interviewed a former Bloomberg employee , David Zielenziger , who said that he witnessed the conversation . Zielenziger not only confirmed that he heard it , he said it was typical . \u201c He talked kind of crudely about women all the time , \u201d he told the Post .\nThe Post also obtained and published a notorious booklet compiled by a Bloomberg employee that contained some of his most degrading and profane alleged comments around the workplace . Titled \u201c The Wit and Wisdom of Michael Bloomberg , \u201d the 32-page booklet contains crude boasts and jokes , such as the claim that his famous computer system \u201c will do everything , including give you [ oral sex ] . I guess that puts a lot of you girls out of business . \u201d\nIn 2001 , a Bloomberg spokesperson admitted that the booklet contained \u201c some of the things he might have said \u201d and Bloomberg has apologized to people offended by the booklet . But what \u2019 s striking is that Bloomberg \u2019 s campaign today takes the stance that he never said anything in that booklet . \u201c Mike simply did not say the things somebody wrote in this gag gift , \u201d Bloomberg spokesperson Stu Loeser told the Post .\nLoeser also added a general blanket statement about Bloomberg \u2019 s past remarks that have stirred controversy : \u201c Mike openly admits that his words have not always aligned with his values and the way he has led his life and some of what he has said is disrespectful and wrong. \u201d It \u2019 s worth noting the lack of specificity of the statement given the number of accusations made against Bloomberg , and the fact that it is not an apology for his past behavior .\nThe Bloomberg campaign did not respond to a request for comment from \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nIn a Saturday tweet that seemed to address the Post article , however , Bloomberg wrote , \u201c I would not be where I am today without the talented women around me . I \u2019 ve depended on their leadership , their advice and their contributions . As I \u2019 ve demonstrated throughout my career , I will always be a champion for women in the workplace . \u201d\nGarrison \u2019 s complaint also reportedly contains some allegations Bloomberg made racist remarks while at the office , including the remark about finding \u201c some black \u201d to serve as a nanny , and that the former mayor referred to Mexican clients as \u201c jumping beans . \u201d\nBloomberg \u2019 s behavior toward women is only one of many fronts on which he \u2019 s facing questions over whether it \u2019 s appropriate for him to seek the Democratic nomination .\nHe has also , as the New York Times \u2019 s Alexander Burns , Nicholas Kulish , Lazaro Gamio , and Karl Russell have reported , faced questions about the appropriateness of his charitable and political contributions , and the influence those gifts have given him . Those reporters noted : Bloomberg \u2019 s \u201c political and philanthropic spending has also secured the allegiance or cooperation of powerful institutions and leaders within the Democratic Party who might take issue with parts of his record were they not so reliant on his largess . \u201d\nAnd in recent days , the candidate has had to defend himself against allegations that he is racist following a progressive podcaster resurfacing a 2015 speech . Bloomberg gave the speech defending New York \u2019 s stop-and-frisk program ( which was declared unconstitutional in 2013 ) , in which he said , \u201c Ninety-five percent of your murders \u2014 murderers and murder victims \u2014 fit one M.O . You can just take the description , Xerox it and pass it out to all the cops . They are male , minorities , 16 to 25 . \u201d\nA clip of that speech went viral and led to # BloombergIsRacist trending for much of the day Tuesday .\nBloomberg has apologized for supporting the program in recent months , and did so again Thursday , saying , \u201c I defended it , looking back , for too long because I didn \u2019 t understand then the unintended pain it was causing to young black and brown families and their kids . ... I apologize . \u201d\nThe effectiveness of these apologies \u2014 and what , if any , damage to Bloomberg \u2019 s campaign these controversies are inflicting \u2014 remains to be seen .\nFor now , Bloomberg remains strikingly popular among black voters ; a recent Quinnipiac poll , for instance , found he is the second most popular candidate among that demographic group , behind only former Vice President Joe Biden . And he has won the endorsements of a number of prominent black women politicians , including Rep. Lucy McBath , San Francisco Mayor London Breed , and Washington , DC , Mayor Muriel Bowser .\nMany of the concerns about the former mayor appear to come from progressive candidates ( like Warren \u2019 s call for Bloomberg to release those bound by NDAs ) and their surrogates ( like Sanders surrogate Shaun King \u2019 s critiques of Bloomberg on race , sex , and religion ) . It is not clear that moderate voters share these concerns \u2014 particularly given Bloomberg \u2019 s poll numbers \u2014 meaning the candidate \u2019 s moment of truth is likely to come on Super Tuesday .",
