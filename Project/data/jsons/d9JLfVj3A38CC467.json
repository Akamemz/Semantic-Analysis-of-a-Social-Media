Um \u2014 austin mitchell Yeah , what do you mean when you say , \u201c What a day already \u201c ? astead herndon Well , we just reported that Elizabeth Warren is dropping out of the presidential race . We \u2019 re here in Boston outside of her house . Not in Boston , actually . Cambridge . Waiting for her to speak to a horde of media , both local and national . speaker 1 We have \u2014 speaker 2 I understand that , but I was here before you guys all jumped in front of me . speaker 1 Because we just found out we have to move .\nFrom The New York Times , this is \u201c The Field. \u201d I \u2019 m Astead Herndon in Massachusetts .\n[ cheering ] Around 12:30 on Thursday , Senator Elizabeth Warren came out of a side door of her house with her husband and her golden retriever and addressed the media . archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) All right . So I announced this morning that I am suspending my campaign for president . I say this with a deep sense of gratitude .\nIt \u2019 s been two days since Super Tuesday , where Elizabeth Warren \u2019 s best finish was in third place , including in her home state of Massachusetts . That put her behind her campaign \u2019 s already lowered expectations and made a gathering like today feel almost inevitable .\nShe thanks her supporters and her staff and takes questions .\narchived recording ( reporter ) Senator , will you be making an endorsement today ? We know that you spoke with both Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders yesterday . archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) Not today . Not today . I need some space around this .\nAnd when it comes to why she has to drop out ?\narchived recording ( elizabeth warren ) You know , I was told at the beginning of this whole undertaking that there are two lanes , a progressive lane that Bernie Sanders is the incumbent for , and a moderate lane that Joe Biden is the incumbent for . And there \u2019 s no room for anyone else in this . I thought that wasn \u2019 t right , but evidently I was wrong . archived recording ( reporters ) Senator , why do you think \u2014\narchived recording ( reporter ) And I wonder what the message would be to the women and girls who feel like we \u2019 re left with two white men to decide between ? archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) I know . One of the hardest parts of this is all those little girls who are going to have to wait four more years . That \u2019 s going to be hard . archived recording ( reporters ) Senator , why do you think \u2014\nShe gets emotional , but there are clearly things that she \u2019 s left unsaid . But when you ask her supporters who have come to the house to watch this speech , they go there .\nwarren supporter 1 Oh , I \u2019 m so sad . Yesterday , I so sad I couldn \u2019 t \u2014 I couldn \u2019 t move . warren supporter 2 I \u2019 m frustrated , I \u2019 m disappointed , and sad . warren supporter 3 I \u2019 m heartbroken that very clearly most qualified candidate is out of the race . warren supporter 4 Sadly , too many people in this country aren \u2019 t ready for a woman president , which is an unfortunate thing . warren supporter 5 Very disappointed , but I guess there \u2019 s never going to be a time for a woman . She \u2019 s my generation , and we \u2019 re not going to see it now . This was our \u2014 it \u2019 s not going to happen . toddler ( CRYING ) Grandma , Grandma , I wan na go home ! warren supporter 5 Maybe her generation . All right , we got ta go . Look at this little girl looking at the doggie . She likes the doggie .\nToday , millions of voters across six states will cast their ballot for the two viable Democratic candidates left : Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders . What began as a contest with historic diversity , along racial and gender lines , has now come down to two men , 70 plus , both white . And as someone who covered senator Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren , and with Warren especially , who once led in national polling , I \u2019 m left to wonder how did we get here ? How did it end up this way ?\n[ doorbell ringing ] astead herndon Wow . Oh , those are one of the fancy doorbells , where you can look at it with your phone . Hello , how are you ? lyn licciardello Hello , a party . astead herndon Hi , my name \u2019 s Astead . I \u2019 m a politics reporter at The Times . lyn licciardello Hi , nice to meet you . astead herndon It \u2019 s nice to meet you . lyn licciardello I \u2019 m Lyn . What did you say your name is ? astead herndon Astead . lyn licciardello Astead ? astead herndon Yes . jessica cheung I \u2019 m Jessica \u2014\nSo the next day , me and producers Austin Mitchell and Jessica Cheung go to North Andover , Massachusetts .\naustin mitchell Should we take our shoes off ? lyn licciardello Oh , you don \u2019 t have to . jessica cheung You sure ?\nTo meet with a pretty typical Warren supporter , Lyn Licciardello .\nastead herndon I only have one sock on . lyn licciardello It \u2019 s fine . [ LAUGHTER ] jessica cheung You have what ? astead herndon I only have one sock on . [ laughter ] austin mitchell How does that happen ?\nlyn licciardello Tommy , will you pour water , please ? tom licciardello Yes , I knew there was a role for me somewhere .\nastead herndon What do you do ? lyn licciardello I am a nurse , but I teach exercise now . astead herndon Oh , very nice . Give me \u2014 what exercise ? lyn licciardello Oh , well , I teach a class that \u2019 s about the first half is aerobic , and then there \u2019 s some stretching and strength training . It \u2019 s about an hour class at the senior center in Lawrence . astead herndon Awesome . How long have you been in North Andover ? lyn licciardello Since 1949. astead herndon Hm . And when did you first notice Senator Warren ? lyn licciardello I noticed Senator Warren years ago . I think it was around 2012 . I happened to be reading the paper one morning . And I noticed that a congressman named Todd Akin had said a horrible thing about women and pregnancy , saying that if a woman were to get pregnant as a result of rape , then her body has a way of getting rid of that . archived recording ( todd akin ) It seems to me , first of all , from what I understand from doctors , that \u2019 s really rare . If it \u2019 s a legitimate rape , the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down . lyn licciardello And my eyes just flew open , and I said , oh my god , this man is in our Congress . I was flabbergasted , and I said to my husband , who is that woman ? There was a \u2014 at the same time , I was not happy with Scott Brown , who was our senator at the time . archived recording He doesn \u2019 t stand up for women \u2019 s reproductive rights and economic security . He co-sponsored legislation to let employers deny women coverage for birth control or even mammograms . He had two opportunities \u2014 lyn licciardello And I said , who \u2019 s that woman that \u2019 s going to run against Scott Brown ? I heard that a woman is going to run against Scott Brown . archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) I \u2019 m Elizabeth Warren . I \u2019 m running for the United States Senate . And before you hear a bunch of ridiculous attack ads , I want to tell you who I am . Like a lot of you , I came up the hard way . lyn licciardello And I said , I have to do something to help her get elected . archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) But Washington is still rigged for the big guys , and that \u2019 s got ta change . I \u2019 m Elizabeth Warren , and I approve this message , because I want Massachusetts families to have a level playing field .\nAnd so Lyn becomes a volunteer for the Warren Senate campaign .\nlyn licciardello I was always on board with Elizabeth right after that . astead herndon Why do you think you felt so drawn to Elizabeth Warren ? lyn licciardello Because in many ways , she \u2019 s me . She \u2019 s me . She has the same feelings that I have . She \u2019 s actually very close to my age . She has a wonderful way of kind of looking into your heart and mind . She \u2019 s interested in you . She \u2019 s interested in the people . archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) Hi , I \u2019 m Elizabeth Warren . It \u2019 s very nice to see you . speaker I \u2019 m going to vote for you . archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) Wonderful , say that again . Fabulous . We \u2019 re here for the chicken . [ LAUGHTER ] Good to see you . I like your shirt . Very handsome . lyn licciardello Elizabeth has that heart . And , she \u2019 s brilliant . archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) And despite the odds , you elected the first woman senator to the state of Massachusetts . [ CHEERING ] astead herndon How did it feel ? I mean , she wins the race , obviously . How did that feel ? lyn licciardello Oh , my god . It was so exciting . I still can \u2019 t say that without crying . It was so exciting .\nlyn licciardello Well , I was for Hillary . Hillary , I was very invested in having Hillary be president . She had all the qualifications . She was more qualified than anybody who \u2019 s ever been president , in my opinion . But because she was a woman , I knew it would be difficult . But I still thought she could win . astead herndon Did you know people or did you hear people say , I won \u2019 t vote for Clinton because she \u2019 s a woman ? lyn licciardello Not like that . But here \u2019 s what I did hear . I was talking to a woman who was kind of a stranger , but we were chatting . And we were talking about politics and about how we feel about certain things . So I guess it was like immigration , climate change and things like that . And this woman was on board with all of the Democratic ideals . And then I mentioned Hillary Clinton , and she said , \u201c Oh , I hate her. \u201d And I said , \u201c Really ? Because she \u2019 s the one who stands for all of these things that we \u2019 re talking about. \u201d \u201c No , no . I can \u2019 t stand her. \u201d I said , \u201c Well , why don \u2019 t you like her ? \u201d \u201c Oh , I have no idea. \u201d I said , \u201c Is it because she \u2019 s an aggressive woman ? Is she too aggressive ? Is she too loud ? Does she express herself too much ? \u201d And her reply was , \u201c No . I don \u2019 t know why. \u201d So like a minute later , I mentioned Elizabeth Warren . She said , \u201c Oh , I can \u2019 t stand her either. \u201d So I was like , \u201c She agrees with you about everything ! All the things that you \u2019 re saying you believe in , she is promoting. \u201d \u201c No , well , I can \u2019 t stand her. \u201d So , I know . I mean , I \u2019 ve been a woman my whole life . So I know very well that that is the reason . Even women will vote against women , because they \u2019 re women . archived recording ( joy behar ) There are people out there who have this idea that you \u2019 re not trustworthy , that they don \u2019 t like you for some reason . What is that about , in your opinion ? archived recording ( hillary clinton ) You know , Joy , obviously I \u2019 ve thought a lot about it , because I don \u2019 t like to hear it . archived recording ( joy behar ) Yeah . archived recording ( hillary clinton ) So I need to figure out what \u2019 s behind it . You know , I am perhaps a more serious person , a more reserved person than is in the public arena these days . So I think people then say , \u201c Well , she \u2019 s serious . She \u2019 s reserved . Can I really like her ? \u201d archived recording ( joy behar ) But what is inauthentic ? What \u2019 s inauthentic mean ? archived recording ( hillary clinton ) I don \u2019 t understand that . I don \u2019 t understand that . Because I \u2019 ve been pretty much the same person my entire life , for better or worse , right ? archived recording ( joy behar ) Mm-hm . lyn licciardello Clinton losing made a difference . Clinton losing did make it harder for me to think that a woman could win .\nSo this year , when Elizabeth Warren announces that she \u2019 s running , Lyn has mixed feelings .\nlyn licciardello I love that people were getting to know her all across the country . archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) Hi . archived recording ( raelyn ) Hi , my name \u2019 s Raelyn . archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) Hi , Raelyn . archived recording ( raelyn ) I was wondering if there was ever a time in your life where somebody you really looked up to maybe didn \u2019 t accept you as much and how you dealt with that ? archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) Yeah . My mother and I had very different views of how to build a future . She wanted me to marry well . And I really tried , and it just didn \u2019 t work out . But I also know it was the right thing to do . And sometimes , you just got ta do what \u2019 s right inside . You got ta take care of yourself first and do this . Give me a hug . [ APPLAUSE ] lyn licciardello And it was a pleasure for me to see that , although I was a little bit worried . archived recording 1 In the wake of her third place finish in Iowa and fourth place finish in New Hampshire , Warren said , \u201c My job is to persist. \u201d But persisting and winning are two very different things . archived recording 2 Senator Elizabeth Warren , she came in fifth place in South Carolina . archived recording 3 Elizabeth Warren trailing in fourth place in Nevada . archived recording 4 I think the biggest question that Elizabeth Warren has to answer is , where does she win ?\nLyn voted early in Massachusetts for Senator Warren . But in the days leading up to Super Tuesday , she \u2019 s questioning her vote and wondering if she did the right thing .\nlyn licciardello But I didn \u2019 t feel \u2014 I didn \u2019 t feel bad that I had already voted for her at all , because like she said , vote with your heart . And she was my heart . jessica cheung Did you know anyone personally in your life who were for Warren and then jumped ship ? lyn licciardello Yes , my cousin Kathleen . astead herndon Raising her hand . kathleen lambert Yes , actually as soon as Buttigieg and Klobuchar backed Biden \u2014 and I was kind of waiting to see how it all shook out a little bit \u2014 I voted for Biden because we have to stop Sanders , in my opinion . But I would have voted for Warren , because I voted for Hillary .\nAs Kathleen is talking , Tom nods and raises his hand .\naustin mitchell Yeah , did you raise your hand , too ? tom licciardello Me too . Yeah , yeah . Yeah , actually as the sole old white guy in the room , I , too , did vote for Biden , though I love Elizabeth Warren , and she would have made an extraordinarily wonderful president . astead herndon By the time Massachusetts was voting , if she looked more electable , if she was a front-runner , you all would have stuck with her ? tom licciardello Yeah , you bet . kathleen lambert Absolutely , yeah . astead herndon Did you see when she \u2014 obviously when she comes out and talks at her house , did you see that ? lyn licciardello Oh , yes . I was here in the living room . I was in my own living room listening to it , watching . And yeah , I cried through the whole thing . It \u2019 s heartbreaking . astead herndon Do you remember something she said that day that stuck with you or maybe caused you to feel that emotion ? lyn licciardello Well , one of the things was that , you know how she talked about the pinkie swear that she does with the little kids ? The first time I met her , which was way back when , before she was elected senator for the first time , she was doing that with little girls that were there . jessica cheung What is the pinkie swear ? What is she promising girls ? lyn licciardello She says that girls can be president . She gets right down to their level . She gets right down to their eye level and talks to the girls like that . astead herndon The race is now down to two guys , after starting with such a diverse field , gender ratio , all of that . How does it feel for it to be down to two men , when you had four women senators at the start , all of whom you liked ? lyn licciardello I know . It \u2019 s sick , isn \u2019 t it ? [ CHUCKLES ] You know , it was almost inevitable . I think people pan \u2014 not panicked , but I think that people are very , very concerned that we have to beat Trump . astead herndon But why does the feeling of \u201c need to beat Trump \u201d then translate to men ? So you \u2019 re saying , I think a lot of people are scared , I think a lot of people just want to beat Trump , and that \u2019 s why it came down to two men . What is necessarily male about those qualities ? lyn licciardello Because there are so many people in the country that just would not vote for a woman , like that woman that I was talking about before . And we really feel the need to prevail this time , especially . astead herndon So the idea that a woman candidate is a risk because of other people \u2019 s or the country \u2019 s sexism ? lyn licciardello Yes , that \u2019 s how I feel . It \u2019 s a terrible thing to have to feel , but I do feel that way . Right now . I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s always going to be like that , but I think it \u2019 s the way it is right now .\njessica cheung All right . austin mitchell Thank you . You can go skiing now . lyn licciardello Oh , good . I \u2019 m sorry you can \u2019 t come with us . That was too bad . jessica cheung Tell us where you \u2019 re going . lyn licciardello Warren , Vermont . [ LAUGHS ] It \u2019 s very funny , because we have our ski place right next to our daughter and son-in-law in Warren , Vermont . And our son-in-law \u2019 s parents live in Warren , Rhode Island . laughter astead herndon A Warren household to the end . lyn licciardello Yes .\nIt \u2019 s one voter \u2019 s view that sexism is what consumed the Elizabeth Warren campaign . And certainly that \u2019 s one that \u2019 s popular among her most die-hard supporters . But I \u2019 m wondering , is this the view inside her own campaign ? Do they think that the barriers that gender placed on them were too big to overcome ? The same day we met with Lyn , we headed to the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston , to Elizabeth Warren \u2019 s campaign headquarters .\nastead herndon It \u2019 s kind of like a warehousey building , nondescript , very on brand . There is a Dunkin \u2019 Donuts right across the street .\nTo meet with someone who \u2019 s worked for the Warren campaign from the start .\nkristen orthman I \u2019 m Kristen Orthman , the communications director for Elizabeth Warren .\nAs communications director , Kristen \u2019 s in charge of trying to best translate the candidate to the rest of the country , particularly through the media . And over the course of this campaign , we got to know each other pretty well . Now that the campaign has ended , I \u2019 m wondering whether Kristen will speak more candidly about what went wrong and about what role gender specifically played in the campaign \u2019 s demise .\nastead herndon Is there something different about planning communications and media for women politicians ? kristen orthman Yes . astead herndon [ LAUGHS ] Yeah , in what way ? kristen orthman I think that there can be more caution when you \u2019 re working for a woman , because you \u2019 re viewing things through the lens of much more of \u201c how will this be perceived ? \u201d And I think I \u2019 ve an appreciation for the challenges of the Clinton presidential campaign probably now than I did when I first started . astead herndon In what way ? kristen orthman I think that the fact that there were stories when Elizabeth first ran \u2014 there was an infamous one like the day she announced .\nThis is December 31 , 2018 , when Warren first announced her intentions to seek the presidency .\nkristen orthman Talking about like , I think it was the likability factor , her versus Hillary . Because they were two women who ran for president , two white women who ran for president that had blond hair . I mean , I guess I \u2019 m not quite sure what else warranted necessarily that . astead herndon So when it becomes clear she \u2019 s running for president , how forefront of mind was gender and the need to define her on her own , outside of Clinton or whatever terms ? kristen orthman I think when you \u2019 re running for president , male , female , you have to be yourself . So what I was always , and what our team and her always wanted to make sure is , you are showing what you would hope is the truest version of yourself .\nOne of the critiques of the Clinton campaign , fair or not , was that many voters felt like they never really knew her authentic self , that there was a barrier between candidate and voter built up over all those years in the public eye . So Kristen and her team tried to go in the opposite direction . To distinguish Warren , both from Clinton but also from everyone else .\nkristen orthman You know , she runs out on stage . archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) Hello , Indianola ! kristen orthman She dances . archived recording [ CHEERING ] kristen orthman She stays for hours for photos . archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) So we just finished our event here in New York City , and I got a lot of notes and a [ INAUDIBLE ] . kristen orthman She is just like the compassionate and joyful person that I know behind the scenes , was the person that was on a town hall stage . Or the fighter that I \u2019 ve also seen behind the scenes , and that many people saw , whether in the hearing room or otherwise , was the person on the debate stage . There is a vulnerability that comes with that , being a female candidate versus being a male candidate . I always was thinking through the risks in that , because I just knew that the \u201c mistakes \u201d that \u2014 I \u2019 m using quotes , because I don \u2019 t always they were , but they were perceived as mistakes \u2014 that female candidates make . It \u2019 s like a higher bar .\nBut to her , these risks were necessary components of running an authentic campaign .\nkristen orthman Let \u2019 s do the things that have now become like signatures , were signatures of the campaign . It \u2019 s like , well , OK , she \u2019 s running for president to say something and do something . So let \u2019 s start doing that . archived recording 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren is leading the pack when it comes to policy proposals . archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) So I \u2019 ve got a plan for 3.2 million new housing units in America . I \u2019 ve got a plan to put $ 800 billion new federal into our public schools . Student loan debt , I \u2019 ve got a plan for that . And corruption .\nShe became known as the \u201c I have a plan for that \u201d candidate .\nkristen orthman The \u201c I have a plan for that \u201d just happened organically . Time Magazine put it on the cover , and that \u2019 s when it became more of a thing . I think it happened grassroots level before that . People start talking about it , because we were doing it . astead herndon There was like a whole meme section of like , Warren plan . kristen orthman Exactly , that \u2019 s what I mean . Yeah , exactly , exactly .\nAnd by the end of last fall , Warren has crossed into front-runner status . She \u2019 s leading in some national polls . But this is also about the time that I noticed a shift in the race .\nastead herndon The primary change from a contest to ideas , to one of just as obsession about who can win . Do you think that \u2019 s true ? kristen orthman I think the primary campaign has always been about who can win . astead herndon How does that impact the women , specifically , who are running ? kristen orthman I do think I need distance in order to fully formulate , but I don \u2019 t think there \u2019 s any question that electability was viewed through a lens that probably hurt the women candidates . Because there was a perception that , after 2016 , even though the female candidate got 3 million more votes , is a woman not electable ? And she has said before publicly that she would hear that from people in the early states . Like , \u201c I \u2019 m worried about who can beat Trump. \u201d But I don \u2019 t think all of a sudden in October it was like , \u201c Oh , let \u2019 s make this primary about who \u2019 s going to beat Donald Trump. \u201d That \u2019 s what it \u2019 s been .\nI would largely agree . Certainly , electability has never been far from mind for most Democratic voters . But as more and more people tuned into the race , particularly around this time in the late fall , it shifted its tone . Policy ideas took a back seat to that electability question . And the candidates who had most clearly articulated their path to victory started to rise , while Elizabeth Warren started to fall . This coincided with rival candidates like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar increasingly casting Warren \u2019 s campaign as out of touch with the mainstream Democratic Party and a real general election risk . And so to respond to that scrutiny , the Warren campaign tries to reposition itself as a unity candidate , someone who can actually bring all sides together .\nastead herndon There \u2019 s sometime during the unity candidate phase , where I did feel like it was different from the fight that we had heard before . kristen orthman Mm-hm . astead herndon How do you square those two versions that we did see just this year ? kristen orthman I mean , I think you can both \u2014 unity doesn \u2019 t mean not fighting . I never didn \u2019 t think she was herself . astead herndon Take us into debate prep , for instance . Like , are you sitting there thinking , \u201c We have to package a candidate , and there are concerns about how she \u2019 ll be perceived if she attacks too much or attacks too little. \u201d Like , how much is gender a concern as you are thinking about the big national combative moments ? kristen orthman Mm-hm . You know , I don \u2019 t want to make a big statement saying it \u2019 s easier for men to attack than women . I do think that there are probably greater consequences to a failed attack by a female than a failed attack by a male . Because obviously she had a debate performance a couple \u2014 two debates ago \u2014 where she doing some level of contrasts with Mayor Bloomgberg . laughter astead herndon Understatement of human history . archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) I \u2019 d like to talk about who we \u2019 re running against \u2014 a billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians . And , no , I \u2019 m not talking about Donald Trump . I \u2019 m talking about Mayor Bloomberg . Democrats are not going to \u2014 kristen orthman She was really strong . She was tough , and she was dynamic . archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) Democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another . This country has worked \u2014 kristen orthman They were contrasting with each other , and I think overall , it was agreed upon that she did well in that exchange .\nBut this came in Nevada , after two straight disappointing finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire .\nastead herndon I mean , if we \u2019 re just going to take Nevada , I feel like that is a reason to ask why then and not previously ? Were you all in rooms saying , \u201c Well , we can \u2019 t attack yet \u201c ? One of things I remember from the second this campaign started was the way that supporters were so eager to see her cut down the Bidens and the Bernies and everyone else . It really didn \u2019 t get that payoff until Nevada . kristen orthman Mm-hm . astead herndon Why ? kristen orthman So I like reject the premise of your question , because I think that you can be both advocating for yourself and creating contrast in ways that are not \u2014 that don \u2019 t always need to be how it happened in Nevada . archived recording ( moderator ) Senator Warren , what did you think when Senator Sanders told you a woman could not win the election ? archived recording [ LAUGHTER ] archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) I disagreed . Bernie is my friend , and I am not here to try to fight with Bernie . But look \u2014 kristen orthman Now , some would say about \u2014 and this is what I heard frequently from reporters \u2014 \u201c Oh , you guys are doing subtle contrasts . People don \u2019 t get that . People don \u2019 t know that. \u201d I don \u2019 t necessarily agree with that . I think that you \u2019 re always looking at the bar of how do we balance advocating for yourself and your ideas versus contrasting with other people . jessica cheung You characterize Warren as contrasting with Bloomberg . kristen orthman Yes . jessica cheung Others might characterize that as she was attacking Bloomberg or going after Bloomberg . kristen orthman Yeah . jessica cheung And I wonder \u2014 yeah , I wonder if in your role , you \u2019 re choosing your words carefully , because you know that male politicians are treated differently or characterized differently than female politicians . kristen orthman I very specifically used the word \u201c contrast. \u201d So you are correct that I was specifically choosing those words . That was your question , right ? Yeah . astead herndon There is a prevailing view from Warren supporters that gender was the foremost reason that she wasn \u2019 t successful in this race . Do you share that feeling ? kristen orthman You think that \u2019 s a prevailing view ? astead herndon Yeah , definitely . kristen orthman I just think I probably need more time to think about it . And I \u2019 m not trying to not answer your question . I think that there were \u2014 what she said yesterday around , like , there were basically two ideological , I think she called them poles . We could call them lanes . That \u2019 s not necessarily genderized . That is an ideological reason . And then I think electability , the idea of electability , was the other reason . Now , the idea of electability through the eyes of , \u201c can a woman win \u201c ? Certainly , that \u2019 s gender . And I would add that it wasn \u2019 t just \u201c can a woman win ? \u201d It was , can a non-white or non-male candidate win ? astead herndon For that last point , it seems as if , then , this kind of place that we \u2019 ve ended , with two people on the ideological poles , both of them being white males , was that inevitable ? kristen orthman I mean , maybe . I don \u2019 t know .\nastead herndon Yeah , we \u2019 ll see you later . jessica cheung Bye , we \u2019 ll see you later . astead herndon It \u2019 s so hard to get people \u2014 I think this is true . I mean , particularly being a male reporter asking women about sexism , you need people to \u2014 like , oh , were you thinking about this , then ? But that \u2019 s not really how biases work , right ? Like , does she say \u201c contrast \u201d and not \u201c attack \u201d because of sexism ? Maybe . But it \u2019 s so deeply pervasive that it \u2019 s not something you actively think about as you \u2019 re doing it . And I feel like that makes sometimes the reporting challenge difficult , because you \u2019 re asking these candidates , like , wasn \u2019 t that sexist ? Wasn \u2019 t that racist ? Wasn \u2019 t that blah , blah , blah . And it \u2019 s like , maybe ? I think there were a lot of challenges in the race , and ideology was one , name recognition is one , fund-raising is one , and sexism and gender pervades all of those things . And does it define all of those things ? Maybe it informs all of those things is a better way to put it , but you know , how do you now ? archived recording ( elizabeth warren ) Gender in this race , you know that is the trap question for every woman . If you say , yeah , there was sexism in this race , everyone says \u201c whiner. \u201d And if you say , no , there was no sexism , about a bazillion women think , what planet do you live on ? I promise you this . I will have a lot more to say on that subject later on . archived recording Senator , advice to your supporters right now looking for a candidate . What is your advice to them ?",

Um \u2014 austin mitchell Yeah, what do you mean when you say, \u201cWhat a day already\u201c? astead herndon Well, we just reported that Elizabeth Warren is dropping out of the presidential race. We\u2019re here in Boston outside of her house. Not in Boston, actually. Cambridge. Waiting for her to speak to a horde of media, both local and national. speaker 1 We have \u2014 speaker 2 I understand that, but I was here before you guys all jumped in front of me. speaker 1 Because we just found out we have to move.\n\nastead herndon\n\nFrom The New York Times, this is \u201cThe Field.\u201d I\u2019m Astead Herndon in Massachusetts.\n\n[cheering] Around 12:30 on Thursday, Senator Elizabeth Warren came out of a side door of her house with her husband and her golden retriever and addressed the media. archived recording (elizabeth warren) All right. So I announced this morning that I am suspending my campaign for president. I say this with a deep sense of gratitude.\n\nastead herndon\n\nIt\u2019s been two days since Super Tuesday, where Elizabeth Warren\u2019s best finish was in third place, including in her home state of Massachusetts. That put her behind her campaign\u2019s already lowered expectations and made a gathering like today feel almost inevitable.\n\narchived recording (elizabeth warren) For every single person \u2014\n\nastead herndon\n\nShe thanks her supporters and her staff and takes questions.\n\narchived recording (reporter) Senator, will you be making an endorsement today? We know that you spoke with both Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders yesterday. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Not today. Not today. I need some space around this.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd when it comes to why she has to drop out?\n\narchived recording (elizabeth warren) You know, I was told at the beginning of this whole undertaking that there are two lanes, a progressive lane that Bernie Sanders is the incumbent for, and a moderate lane that Joe Biden is the incumbent for. And there\u2019s no room for anyone else in this. I thought that wasn\u2019t right, but evidently I was wrong. archived recording (reporters) Senator, why do you think \u2014\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd on the question of gender?\n\narchived recording (reporter) And I wonder what the message would be to the women and girls who feel like we\u2019re left with two white men to decide between? archived recording (elizabeth warren) I know. One of the hardest parts of this is all those little girls who are going to have to wait four more years. That\u2019s going to be hard. archived recording (reporters) Senator, why do you think \u2014\n\nastead herndon\n\nShe gets emotional, but there are clearly things that she\u2019s left unsaid. But when you ask her supporters who have come to the house to watch this speech, they go there.\n\nwarren supporter 1 Oh, I\u2019m so sad. Yesterday, I so sad I couldn\u2019t \u2014 I couldn\u2019t move. warren supporter 2 I\u2019m frustrated, I\u2019m disappointed, and sad. warren supporter 3 I\u2019m heartbroken that very clearly most qualified candidate is out of the race. warren supporter 4 Sadly, too many people in this country aren\u2019t ready for a woman president, which is an unfortunate thing. warren supporter 5 Very disappointed, but I guess there\u2019s never going to be a time for a woman. She\u2019s my generation, and we\u2019re not going to see it now. This was our \u2014 it\u2019s not going to happen. toddler (CRYING) Grandma, Grandma, I wanna go home! warren supporter 5 Maybe her generation. All right, we gotta go. Look at this little girl looking at the doggie. She likes the doggie.\n\nastead herndon\n\nToday, millions of voters across six states will cast their ballot for the two viable Democratic candidates left: Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. What began as a contest with historic diversity, along racial and gender lines, has now come down to two men, 70 plus, both white. And as someone who covered senator Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, and with Warren especially, who once led in national polling, I\u2019m left to wonder how did we get here? How did it end up this way?\n\n[doorbell ringing] astead herndon Wow. Oh, those are one of the fancy doorbells, where you can look at it with your phone. Hello, how are you? lyn licciardello Hello, a party. astead herndon Hi, my name\u2019s Astead. I\u2019m a politics reporter at The Times. lyn licciardello Hi, nice to meet you. astead herndon It\u2019s nice to meet you. lyn licciardello I\u2019m Lyn. What did you say your name is? astead herndon Astead. lyn licciardello Astead? astead herndon Yes. jessica cheung I\u2019m Jessica \u2014\n\nastead herndon\n\nSo the next day, me and producers Austin Mitchell and Jessica Cheung go to North Andover, Massachusetts.\n\naustin mitchell Should we take our shoes off? lyn licciardello Oh, you don\u2019t have to. jessica cheung You sure?\n\nastead herndon\n\nTo meet with a pretty typical Warren supporter, Lyn Licciardello.\n\nastead herndon I only have one sock on. lyn licciardello It\u2019s fine. [LAUGHTER] jessica cheung You have what? astead herndon I only have one sock on. [laughter] austin mitchell How does that happen?\n\nastead herndon\n\nHer husband Tom is there, too.\n\nlyn licciardello Tommy, will you pour water, please? tom licciardello Yes, I knew there was a role for me somewhere.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd her cousin Kathleen.\n\nkathleen lambert Let me take your coats.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd we all sit down in their living room.\n\nastead herndon What do you do? lyn licciardello I am a nurse, but I teach exercise now. astead herndon Oh, very nice. Give me \u2014 what exercise? lyn licciardello Oh, well, I teach a class that\u2019s about the first half is aerobic, and then there\u2019s some stretching and strength training. It\u2019s about an hour class at the senior center in Lawrence. astead herndon Awesome. How long have you been in North Andover? lyn licciardello Since 1949. astead herndon Hm. And when did you first notice Senator Warren? lyn licciardello I noticed Senator Warren years ago. I think it was around 2012. I happened to be reading the paper one morning. And I noticed that a congressman named Todd Akin had said a horrible thing about women and pregnancy, saying that if a woman were to get pregnant as a result of rape, then her body has a way of getting rid of that. archived recording (todd akin) It seems to me, first of all, from what I understand from doctors, that\u2019s really rare. If it\u2019s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. lyn licciardello And my eyes just flew open, and I said, oh my god, this man is in our Congress. I was flabbergasted, and I said to my husband, who is that woman? There was a \u2014 at the same time, I was not happy with Scott Brown, who was our senator at the time. archived recording He doesn\u2019t stand up for women\u2019s reproductive rights and economic security. He co-sponsored legislation to let employers deny women coverage for birth control or even mammograms. He had two opportunities \u2014 lyn licciardello And I said, who\u2019s that woman that\u2019s going to run against Scott Brown? I heard that a woman is going to run against Scott Brown. archived recording (elizabeth warren) I\u2019m Elizabeth Warren. I\u2019m running for the United States Senate. And before you hear a bunch of ridiculous attack ads, I want to tell you who I am. Like a lot of you, I came up the hard way. lyn licciardello And I said, I have to do something to help her get elected. archived recording (elizabeth warren) But Washington is still rigged for the big guys, and that\u2019s gotta change. I\u2019m Elizabeth Warren, and I approve this message, because I want Massachusetts families to have a level playing field.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd so Lyn becomes a volunteer for the Warren Senate campaign.\n\nlyn licciardello I was always on board with Elizabeth right after that. astead herndon Why do you think you felt so drawn to Elizabeth Warren? lyn licciardello Because in many ways, she\u2019s me. She\u2019s me. She has the same feelings that I have. She\u2019s actually very close to my age. She has a wonderful way of kind of looking into your heart and mind. She\u2019s interested in you. She\u2019s interested in the people. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Hi, I\u2019m Elizabeth Warren. It\u2019s very nice to see you. speaker I\u2019m going to vote for you. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Wonderful, say that again. Fabulous. We\u2019re here for the chicken. [LAUGHTER] Good to see you. I like your shirt. Very handsome. lyn licciardello Elizabeth has that heart. And, she\u2019s brilliant. archived recording (elizabeth warren) And despite the odds, you elected the first woman senator to the state of Massachusetts. [CHEERING] astead herndon How did it feel? I mean, she wins the race, obviously. How did that feel? lyn licciardello Oh, my god. It was so exciting. I still can\u2019t say that without crying. It was so exciting.\n\nastead herndon\n\nSo then, in 2016.\n\nlyn licciardello Well, I was for Hillary. Hillary, I was very invested in having Hillary be president. She had all the qualifications. She was more qualified than anybody who\u2019s ever been president, in my opinion. But because she was a woman, I knew it would be difficult. But I still thought she could win. astead herndon Did you know people or did you hear people say, I won\u2019t vote for Clinton because she\u2019s a woman? lyn licciardello Not like that. But here\u2019s what I did hear. I was talking to a woman who was kind of a stranger, but we were chatting. And we were talking about politics and about how we feel about certain things. So I guess it was like immigration, climate change and things like that. And this woman was on board with all of the Democratic ideals. And then I mentioned Hillary Clinton, and she said, \u201cOh, I hate her.\u201d And I said, \u201cReally? Because she\u2019s the one who stands for all of these things that we\u2019re talking about.\u201d \u201cNo, no. I can\u2019t stand her.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you like her?\u201d \u201cOh, I have no idea.\u201d I said, \u201cIs it because she\u2019s an aggressive woman? Is she too aggressive? Is she too loud? Does she express herself too much?\u201d And her reply was, \u201cNo. I don\u2019t know why.\u201d So like a minute later, I mentioned Elizabeth Warren. She said, \u201cOh, I can\u2019t stand her either.\u201d So I was like, \u201cShe agrees with you about everything! All the things that you\u2019re saying you believe in, she is promoting.\u201d \u201cNo, well, I can\u2019t stand her.\u201d So, I know. I mean, I\u2019ve been a woman my whole life. So I know very well that that is the reason. Even women will vote against women, because they\u2019re women. archived recording (joy behar) There are people out there who have this idea that you\u2019re not trustworthy, that they don\u2019t like you for some reason. What is that about, in your opinion? archived recording (hillary clinton) You know, Joy, obviously I\u2019ve thought a lot about it, because I don\u2019t like to hear it. archived recording (joy behar) Yeah. archived recording (hillary clinton) So I need to figure out what\u2019s behind it. You know, I am perhaps a more serious person, a more reserved person than is in the public arena these days. So I think people then say, \u201cWell, she\u2019s serious. She\u2019s reserved. Can I really like her?\u201d archived recording (joy behar) But what is inauthentic? What\u2019s inauthentic mean? archived recording (hillary clinton) I don\u2019t understand that. I don\u2019t understand that. Because I\u2019ve been pretty much the same person my entire life, for better or worse, right? archived recording (joy behar) Mm-hm. lyn licciardello Clinton losing made a difference. Clinton losing did make it harder for me to think that a woman could win.\n\nastead herndon\n\nSo this year, when Elizabeth Warren announces that she\u2019s running, Lyn has mixed feelings.\n\nlyn licciardello I love that people were getting to know her all across the country. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Hi. archived recording (raelyn) Hi, my name\u2019s Raelyn. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Hi, Raelyn. archived recording (raelyn) I was wondering if there was ever a time in your life where somebody you really looked up to maybe didn\u2019t accept you as much and how you dealt with that? archived recording (elizabeth warren) Yeah. My mother and I had very different views of how to build a future. She wanted me to marry well. And I really tried, and it just didn\u2019t work out. But I also know it was the right thing to do. And sometimes, you just gotta do what\u2019s right inside. You gotta take care of yourself first and do this. Give me a hug. [APPLAUSE] lyn licciardello And it was a pleasure for me to see that, although I was a little bit worried. archived recording 1 In the wake of her third place finish in Iowa and fourth place finish in New Hampshire, Warren said, \u201cMy job is to persist.\u201d But persisting and winning are two very different things. archived recording 2 Senator Elizabeth Warren, she came in fifth place in South Carolina. archived recording 3 Elizabeth Warren trailing in fourth place in Nevada. archived recording 4 I think the biggest question that Elizabeth Warren has to answer is, where does she win?\n\nastead herndon\n\nLyn voted early in Massachusetts for Senator Warren. But in the days leading up to Super Tuesday, she\u2019s questioning her vote and wondering if she did the right thing.\n\nlyn licciardello But I didn\u2019t feel \u2014 I didn\u2019t feel bad that I had already voted for her at all, because like she said, vote with your heart. And she was my heart. jessica cheung Did you know anyone personally in your life who were for Warren and then jumped ship? lyn licciardello Yes, my cousin Kathleen. astead herndon Raising her hand. kathleen lambert Yes, actually as soon as Buttigieg and Klobuchar backed Biden \u2014 and I was kind of waiting to see how it all shook out a little bit \u2014 I voted for Biden because we have to stop Sanders, in my opinion. But I would have voted for Warren, because I voted for Hillary.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAs Kathleen is talking, Tom nods and raises his hand.\n\naustin mitchell Yeah, did you raise your hand, too? tom licciardello Me too. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, actually as the sole old white guy in the room, I, too, did vote for Biden, though I love Elizabeth Warren, and she would have made an extraordinarily wonderful president. astead herndon By the time Massachusetts was voting, if she looked more electable, if she was a front-runner, you all would have stuck with her? tom licciardello Yeah, you bet. kathleen lambert Absolutely, yeah. astead herndon Did you see when she \u2014 obviously when she comes out and talks at her house, did you see that? lyn licciardello Oh, yes. I was here in the living room. I was in my own living room listening to it, watching. And yeah, I cried through the whole thing. It\u2019s heartbreaking. astead herndon Do you remember something she said that day that stuck with you or maybe caused you to feel that emotion? lyn licciardello Well, one of the things was that, you know how she talked about the pinkie swear that she does with the little kids? The first time I met her, which was way back when, before she was elected senator for the first time, she was doing that with little girls that were there. jessica cheung What is the pinkie swear? What is she promising girls? lyn licciardello She says that girls can be president. She gets right down to their level. She gets right down to their eye level and talks to the girls like that. astead herndon The race is now down to two guys, after starting with such a diverse field, gender ratio, all of that. How does it feel for it to be down to two men, when you had four women senators at the start, all of whom you liked? lyn licciardello I know. It\u2019s sick, isn\u2019t it? [CHUCKLES] You know, it was almost inevitable. I think people pan \u2014 not panicked, but I think that people are very, very concerned that we have to beat Trump. astead herndon But why does the feeling of \u201cneed to beat Trump\u201d then translate to men? So you\u2019re saying, I think a lot of people are scared, I think a lot of people just want to beat Trump, and that\u2019s why it came down to two men. What is necessarily male about those qualities? lyn licciardello Because there are so many people in the country that just would not vote for a woman, like that woman that I was talking about before. And we really feel the need to prevail this time, especially. astead herndon So the idea that a woman candidate is a risk because of other people\u2019s or the country\u2019s sexism? lyn licciardello Yes, that\u2019s how I feel. It\u2019s a terrible thing to have to feel, but I do feel that way. Right now. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s always going to be like that, but I think it\u2019s the way it is right now.\n\n[music]\n\njessica cheung All right. austin mitchell Thank you. You can go skiing now. lyn licciardello Oh, good. I\u2019m sorry you can\u2019t come with us. That was too bad. jessica cheung Tell us where you\u2019re going. lyn licciardello Warren, Vermont. [LAUGHS] It\u2019s very funny, because we have our ski place right next to our daughter and son-in-law in Warren, Vermont. And our son-in-law\u2019s parents live in Warren, Rhode Island. laughter astead herndon A Warren household to the end. lyn licciardello Yes.\n\nastead herndon\n\nIt\u2019s one voter\u2019s view that sexism is what consumed the Elizabeth Warren campaign. And certainly that\u2019s one that\u2019s popular among her most die-hard supporters. But I\u2019m wondering, is this the view inside her own campaign? Do they think that the barriers that gender placed on them were too big to overcome? The same day we met with Lyn, we headed to the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston, to Elizabeth Warren\u2019s campaign headquarters.\n\nastead herndon It\u2019s kind of like a warehousey building, nondescript, very on brand. There is a Dunkin\u2019 Donuts right across the street.\n\nastead herndon\n\nTo meet with someone who\u2019s worked for the Warren campaign from the start.\n\nkristen orthman I\u2019m Kristen Orthman, the communications director for Elizabeth Warren.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAs communications director, Kristen\u2019s in charge of trying to best translate the candidate to the rest of the country, particularly through the media. And over the course of this campaign, we got to know each other pretty well. Now that the campaign has ended, I\u2019m wondering whether Kristen will speak more candidly about what went wrong and about what role gender specifically played in the campaign\u2019s demise.\n\nastead herndon Is there something different about planning communications and media for women politicians? kristen orthman Yes. astead herndon [LAUGHS] Yeah, in what way? kristen orthman I think that there can be more caution when you\u2019re working for a woman, because you\u2019re viewing things through the lens of much more of \u201chow will this be perceived?\u201d And I think I\u2019ve an appreciation for the challenges of the Clinton presidential campaign probably now than I did when I first started. astead herndon In what way? kristen orthman I think that the fact that there were stories when Elizabeth first ran \u2014 there was an infamous one like the day she announced.\n\nastead herndon\n\nThis is December 31, 2018, when Warren first announced her intentions to seek the presidency.\n\nkristen orthman Talking about like, I think it was the likability factor, her versus Hillary. Because they were two women who ran for president, two white women who ran for president that had blond hair. I mean, I guess I\u2019m not quite sure what else warranted necessarily that. astead herndon So when it becomes clear she\u2019s running for president, how forefront of mind was gender and the need to define her on her own, outside of Clinton or whatever terms? kristen orthman I think when you\u2019re running for president, male, female, you have to be yourself. So what I was always, and what our team and her always wanted to make sure is, you are showing what you would hope is the truest version of yourself.\n\nastead herndon\n\nOne of the critiques of the Clinton campaign, fair or not, was that many voters felt like they never really knew her authentic self, that there was a barrier between candidate and voter built up over all those years in the public eye. So Kristen and her team tried to go in the opposite direction. To distinguish Warren, both from Clinton but also from everyone else.\n\nkristen orthman You know, she runs out on stage. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Hello, Indianola! kristen orthman She dances. archived recording [CHEERING] kristen orthman She stays for hours for photos. archived recording (elizabeth warren) So we just finished our event here in New York City, and I got a lot of notes and a [INAUDIBLE]. kristen orthman She is just like the compassionate and joyful person that I know behind the scenes, was the person that was on a town hall stage. Or the fighter that I\u2019ve also seen behind the scenes, and that many people saw, whether in the hearing room or otherwise, was the person on the debate stage. There is a vulnerability that comes with that, being a female candidate versus being a male candidate. I always was thinking through the risks in that, because I just knew that the \u201cmistakes\u201d that \u2014 I\u2019m using quotes, because I don\u2019t always they were, but they were perceived as mistakes \u2014 that female candidates make. It\u2019s like a higher bar.\n\nastead herndon\n\nBut to her, these risks were necessary components of running an authentic campaign.\n\nkristen orthman Let\u2019s do the things that have now become like signatures, were signatures of the campaign. It\u2019s like, well, OK, she\u2019s running for president to say something and do something. So let\u2019s start doing that. archived recording 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren is leading the pack when it comes to policy proposals. archived recording (elizabeth warren) So I\u2019ve got a plan for 3.2 million new housing units in America. I\u2019ve got a plan to put $800 billion new federal into our public schools. Student loan debt, I\u2019ve got a plan for that. And corruption.\n\nastead herndon\n\nShe became known as the \u201cI have a plan for that\u201d candidate.\n\nkristen orthman The \u201cI have a plan for that\u201d just happened organically. Time Magazine put it on the cover, and that\u2019s when it became more of a thing. I think it happened grassroots level before that. People start talking about it, because we were doing it. astead herndon There was like a whole meme section of like, Warren plan. kristen orthman Exactly, that\u2019s what I mean. Yeah, exactly, exactly.\n\nastead herndon\n\nAnd by the end of last fall, Warren has crossed into front-runner status. She\u2019s leading in some national polls. But this is also about the time that I noticed a shift in the race.\n\nastead herndon The primary change from a contest to ideas, to one of just as obsession about who can win. Do you think that\u2019s true? kristen orthman I think the primary campaign has always been about who can win. astead herndon How does that impact the women, specifically, who are running? kristen orthman I do think I need distance in order to fully formulate, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question that electability was viewed through a lens that probably hurt the women candidates. Because there was a perception that, after 2016, even though the female candidate got 3 million more votes, is a woman not electable? And she has said before publicly that she would hear that from people in the early states. Like, \u201cI\u2019m worried about who can beat Trump.\u201d But I don\u2019t think all of a sudden in October it was like, \u201cOh, let\u2019s make this primary about who\u2019s going to beat Donald Trump.\u201d That\u2019s what it\u2019s been.\n\nastead herndon\n\nI would largely agree. Certainly, electability has never been far from mind for most Democratic voters. But as more and more people tuned into the race, particularly around this time in the late fall, it shifted its tone. Policy ideas took a back seat to that electability question. And the candidates who had most clearly articulated their path to victory started to rise, while Elizabeth Warren started to fall. This coincided with rival candidates like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar increasingly casting Warren\u2019s campaign as out of touch with the mainstream Democratic Party and a real general election risk. And so to respond to that scrutiny, the Warren campaign tries to reposition itself as a unity candidate, someone who can actually bring all sides together.\n\nastead herndon There\u2019s sometime during the unity candidate phase, where I did feel like it was different from the fight that we had heard before. kristen orthman Mm-hm. astead herndon How do you square those two versions that we did see just this year? kristen orthman I mean, I think you can both \u2014 unity doesn\u2019t mean not fighting. I never didn\u2019t think she was herself. astead herndon Take us into debate prep, for instance. Like, are you sitting there thinking, \u201cWe have to package a candidate, and there are concerns about how she\u2019ll be perceived if she attacks too much or attacks too little.\u201d Like, how much is gender a concern as you are thinking about the big national combative moments? kristen orthman Mm-hm. You know, I don\u2019t want to make a big statement saying it\u2019s easier for men to attack than women. I do think that there are probably greater consequences to a failed attack by a female than a failed attack by a male. Because obviously she had a debate performance a couple \u2014 two debates ago \u2014 where she doing some level of contrasts with Mayor Bloomgberg. laughter astead herndon Understatement of human history. archived recording (elizabeth warren) I\u2019d like to talk about who we\u2019re running against \u2014 a billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians. And, no, I\u2019m not talking about Donald Trump. I\u2019m talking about Mayor Bloomberg. Democrats are not going to \u2014 kristen orthman She was really strong. She was tough, and she was dynamic. archived recording (elizabeth warren) Democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another. This country has worked \u2014 kristen orthman They were contrasting with each other, and I think overall, it was agreed upon that she did well in that exchange.\n\nastead herndon\n\nBut this came in Nevada, after two straight disappointing finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nastead herndon I mean, if we\u2019re just going to take Nevada, I feel like that is a reason to ask why then and not previously? Were you all in rooms saying, \u201cWell, we can\u2019t attack yet\u201c? One of things I remember from the second this campaign started was the way that supporters were so eager to see her cut down the Bidens and the Bernies and everyone else. It really didn\u2019t get that payoff until Nevada. kristen orthman Mm-hm. astead herndon Why? kristen orthman So I like reject the premise of your question, because I think that you can be both advocating for yourself and creating contrast in ways that are not \u2014 that don\u2019t always need to be how it happened in Nevada. archived recording (moderator) Senator Warren, what did you think when Senator Sanders told you a woman could not win the election? archived recording [LAUGHTER] archived recording (elizabeth warren) I disagreed. Bernie is my friend, and I am not here to try to fight with Bernie. But look \u2014 kristen orthman Now, some would say about \u2014 and this is what I heard frequently from reporters \u2014 \u201cOh, you guys are doing subtle contrasts. People don\u2019t get that. People don\u2019t know that.\u201d I don\u2019t necessarily agree with that. I think that you\u2019re always looking at the bar of how do we balance advocating for yourself and your ideas versus contrasting with other people. jessica cheung You characterize Warren as contrasting with Bloomberg. kristen orthman Yes. jessica cheung Others might characterize that as she was attacking Bloomberg or going after Bloomberg. kristen orthman Yeah. jessica cheung And I wonder \u2014 yeah, I wonder if in your role, you\u2019re choosing your words carefully, because you know that male politicians are treated differently or characterized differently than female politicians. kristen orthman I very specifically used the word \u201ccontrast.\u201d So you are correct that I was specifically choosing those words. That was your question, right? Yeah. astead herndon There is a prevailing view from Warren supporters that gender was the foremost reason that she wasn\u2019t successful in this race. Do you share that feeling? kristen orthman You think that\u2019s a prevailing view? astead herndon Yeah, definitely. kristen orthman I just think I probably need more time to think about it. And I\u2019m not trying to not answer your question. I think that there were \u2014 what she said yesterday around, like, there were basically two ideological, I think she called them poles. We could call them lanes. That\u2019s not necessarily genderized. That is an ideological reason. And then I think electability, the idea of electability, was the other reason. Now, the idea of electability through the eyes of, \u201ccan a woman win\u201c? Certainly, that\u2019s gender. And I would add that it wasn\u2019t just \u201ccan a woman win?\u201d It was, can a non-white or non-male candidate win? astead herndon For that last point, it seems as if, then, this kind of place that we\u2019ve ended, with two people on the ideological poles, both of them being white males, was that inevitable? kristen orthman I mean, maybe. I don\u2019t know.\n\n[music]\n\nastead herndon Yeah, we\u2019ll see you later. jessica cheung Bye, we\u2019ll see you later. astead herndon It\u2019s so hard to get people \u2014 I think this is true. I mean, particularly being a male reporter asking women about sexism, you need people to \u2014 like, oh, were you thinking about this, then? But that\u2019s not really how biases work, right? Like, does she say \u201ccontrast\u201d and not \u201cattack\u201d because of sexism? Maybe. But it\u2019s so deeply pervasive that it\u2019s not something you actively think about as you\u2019re doing it. And I feel like that makes sometimes the reporting challenge difficult, because you\u2019re asking these candidates, like, wasn\u2019t that sexist? Wasn\u2019t that racist? Wasn\u2019t that blah, blah, blah. And it\u2019s like, maybe? I think there were a lot of challenges in the race, and ideology was one, name recognition is one, fund-raising is one, and sexism and gender pervades all of those things. And does it define all of those things? Maybe it informs all of those things is a better way to put it, but you know, how do you now? archived recording (elizabeth warren) Gender in this race, you know that is the trap question for every woman. If you say, yeah, there was sexism in this race, everyone says \u201cwhiner.\u201d And if you say, no, there was no sexism, about a bazillion women think, what planet do you live on? I promise you this. I will have a lot more to say on that subject later on. archived recording Senator, advice to your supporters right now looking for a candidate. What is your advice to them?\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro",
