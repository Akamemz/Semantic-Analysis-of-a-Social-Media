It would go viral online . It would endear the candidate who dares say it to Democratic voters watching at home ( many of whom are fed up with debate moderators who constantly frame their questions around GOP talking points ) . It would help that candidate dominate the post-debate headlines on cable news .\nBut it would do much more than that : It would serve a major strategic purpose . Democrats who dare to remind pundits and the public of Donald Trump \u2019 s ridiculous yet oft-repeated campaign pledge that \u201c Mexico will pay for the wall \u201d would finally be drawing a crucial line in the sand and saying to Republicans , to the media , and even to each other , that they will no longer be playing the tiresome and very right-wing \u201c pay for \u201d game .\nThe reality is that voters care more about finding solutions to substantive issues than they care about deficits . A new survey conducted by pollsters YouGov for the progressive think tank Data for Progress , for example , found 51 percent of voters back spending billions of dollars on clean energy infrastructure by increasing the deficit , compared to 47 percent who back increasing taxes to pay for such spending .\nBack in June , toward the very beginning of the first Democratic presidential debate in Miami , Florida , moderator Savannah Guthrie of NBC News asked Kamala Harris whether Democrats had a \u201c responsibility to explain how will they pay \u201d for every major proposal they make . \u201c I hear that question , but where was that question when the Republicans and Donald Trump passed a tax bill that \u2026 benefits the top 1 percent and the biggest corporations in this country , contributing at least $ 1 trillion to the debt of America , which middle-class families will pay for one way or another ? \u201d the California senator responded , to loud cheers and applause from the audience inside the hall .\nFrustratingly , though , other Democrats have failed to follow her lead . Instead , in recent months , establishment-friendly candidates such as Joe Biden , Pete Buttigieg , and Amy Klobuchar have fallen over one another to attack ambitious and progressive policies such as Medicare For All for being unaffordable and , ergo , unachievable . \u201c It \u2019 s impossible to pay for Medicare for All without middle class tax increases , \u201d declaimed Biden earlier this month , doing his best impression of a Senate Republican .\nUnder intense pressure from her rivals , as well as from the media , Elizabeth \u201c I have a plan for that \u201d Warren even released a detailed proposal explaining how she would raise $ 20.5 trillion to fund her version of Medicare for All . She gained little more than attacks from her left and from her right , not to mention negative news headlines .\nIt \u2019 s like watching the sequel to a truly awful movie . In 2016 , Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton produced a plethora of very comprehensive and carefully costed plans and policies , earning the sobriquet of \u201c Wonk in Chief \u201d in the process .\nTrump , on the other hand , ranted about an \u201c impenetrable \u201d $ 21 billion wall on the southern border and declared more than 200 times during the campaign that Mexico would pay for it .\nIn fact , Trump not only guaranteed that Mexico would fund his racist barrier \u2014 \u201c They may even write us a check , \u201d he told Fox News \u2019 s Sean Hannity \u2014 but he also promised to eliminate the $ 19 trillion national debt over eight years .
