A progressive friend of mine originally from Ohio confided in me this week how he was enduring the very agony so many New Yorkers are experiencing about the holidays .\nHis relatives back home are enthusiastic Trump supporters , and his brother regularly takes to Facebook to disseminate the type of posts you don \u2019 t have to be a hardcore liberal to find racist and disgusting .\nNot only had my friend debated whether to subject his wife and child to Thanksgiving dinner with his Trump-loving kin , he seriously grappled with the possibility of severing relations with them altogether , as painful as it would be to do so .\nTo his great credit , my friend chose reconciliation over recrimination and called up his brother to explain his anger at both the outcome of the election and the toxic rhetoric he was ashamed to see his bother espouse .\nWhat ensued , in my friend \u2019 s words , was a \u201c knock-down-drag-out \u201d fight which was just as ugly and gut-wrenching as we always fear such confrontations will be\u2014and precisely why we so assiduously avoid them .\nBut out of the hail of invective there emerged slowly , painfully a faint glimmer of understanding\u2014certainly no epiphany\u2014but enough of an appreciation for each other \u2019 s perspective that my friend bemoaned not having brought the simmering conflict with his brother to a boil months ago , before the election was decided .\nOf course , not all of us will make even this baby step of progress taking on our loved ones , but we owe it to both ourselves and our families not to give up on each other . Particularly if you fear that Trump \u2019 s election is a harbinger of the apocalypse or marks the triumph of hatred over empathy , it is your obligation to our nation to do everything you can to pull us back from the precipice\u2014and there is no more likely way you can make a difference than by changing the minds of the people you love , one at a time .\nBut don \u2019 t just engage your family members over the kitchen table to rescue them from their wrongheadedness , do it to expand the acuity of your own thinking .\nOver the last week I have heard far too many of my fellow progressives dismiss Trump \u2019 s voters as racists , misogynists and fascists . While there are certainly a depressing number of them that deserve these characterizations , to brush aside the more than 61 million Americans who cast their ballots for Trump as mere hateful idiots is to perpetuate the liberal elitism that helped fuel Trump \u2019 s success and to disregard the economic and social problems plaguing our country .\nThere was a reason that Trump \u2019 s and Bernie Sanders \u2019 s cries for economic populism intermingled to a discomfiting degree during the campaign season : America is in thrall to corporate interests at the expense of blue-collar and low-wage workers ; both parties were complicit in giving Wall Street a pass in the wake of the 2008 fiscal crisis ; Democratic and Republican administrations have both driven disastrous deregulation in service of the donor class .\nLet \u2019 s be clear : The outrage so many Americans rightfully feel at our rigged system is no excuse whatsoever for racism and xenophobia .
