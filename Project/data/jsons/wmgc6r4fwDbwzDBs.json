    "content": "BOWIE , Maryland \u2014 Sen. Rand Paul ( R-KY ) was a hit speaker on the campus of Bowie State University on Friday , earning several rounds of applause and a standing ovation for the conservative message he delivered to a predominantly liberal audience at the historically black university\u2014part of an outreach effort to traditionally non-Republican communities the senator and potential 2016 GOP presidential candidate has been engaged in nationwide for the five-plus years he \u2019 s been in the U.S. Senate .\nPaul wove individual examples of people throughout history and in modern times who have faced unfair consequences as a result of government \u2019 s heavy hand , making his case to the room on the basis of the need to defend the full Bill of Rights in the Constitution\u2014a classic Tea Party style of speech\u2014all while citing the Founding Fathers , and making economic and social limited government conservative pitch that seemed to resonate throughout the theater inside the student center .\n\u201c Clyde Canard got out of prison the same month that I was born , which was a long time ago , in 1963 , \u201d Paul opened his speech with after a couple thank-yous to organizers . \u201c The reason that Clyde Canard went to prison is that , his crime was he was trying to get enrolled in Mississippi Southern . At that time , it was very difficult for a black man or a woman to enroll . The second time he tried to enroll they planted liquor on him\u2014he didn \u2019 t drink\u2014and gave him a $ 600 fine . Can you imagine what $ 600 was like in 1963 if you were poor in Mississippi ? One thing led to another and he declared bankruptcy . He tried to enroll a third time and he was arrested and bullied by police . But when he tried the third time , he \u2019 s declared bankruptcy and he goes by his farm to pick up some chicken feed\u2014 $ 25 worth of chicken feed\u2014and you know what happens to him ? He \u2019 s arrested , and you know what kind of prison term he \u2019 s given ? Seven years in prison for stealing $ 25 worth of chicken feed which really was his\u2014it was on his land which the bank was repossessing . People \u2019 s lives can spiral out of control from a $ 600 fine . \u201d\nPaul noted that \u201c a lot of things have improved since \u201d 1963 , when this particular example happened\u2014specifically the fact that the United States has gotten rid of segregation by law . However , he said , \u201c we still have a problem in our country that \u2019 s a lot like segregation but it \u2019 s also like there are two systems . \u201d\nThe major theme of Paul \u2019 s speech was a comparison back to the speech of Martin Luther King , Jr. , in 1967 , where the Civil Rights icon argued there are \u201c two Americas. \u201d Paul \u2019 s argument is due to the criminal justice system , the so-called \u201c educational establishment \u201d in Washington as he called it , and especially due to poverty and economic depravity in certain areas of the country , all symptoms of a larger problem that \u2019 s created by an out-of-touch political class that \u2019 s not interested in addressing the heart of the matter : there are Americans of all races and creeds who succeed in life and there are Americans of all races and creeds who don \u2019 t . And it \u2019 s unfair to those who don \u2019 t have a chance at success , he argued , because of a system that \u2019 s been created and abused by politicians .\n\u201c As Martin Luther King said in 1967 , there are two Americas , \u201d Paul said . \u201c There \u2019 s one America that believes in life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . But there \u2019 s another America that is witness to a daily disgrace , a lack of hope , and despair . Why ? Because like Clyde Canard , there are still people in our society who are being hounded by fines , hounded by this and that . \u201d\nWhat \u2019 s notable is that Paul talked about his time in Ferguson , Missouri , and in other black communities across America\u2014but did not blame the police for the problems . In fact , he stood for the police as law enforcement officers just trying to do their jobs\u2014and laid out how the government as a whole , and the politicians who run it , are the real source of the problems facing the second and less fortunate of the \u201c two Americas \u201d he spoke of .\n\u201c Several cities in Missouri , over a third of their budget is gotten by fines , \u201d Paul said . \u201c In Ferguson , there \u2019 s 21,000 people . Last year , there were 31,000 arrests . I tell people it isn \u2019 t just about what happened this year . It \u2019 s about this building up , it \u2019 s about this gradual increase . I call it an undercurrent of unease in our country . There still are two Americas . Most of the people here are part of the America that does believe and can believe in life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . Those who get a college education , those who get an education no matter the color of your skin , you are part of the America that can live the American dream . But there are many people who aren \u2019 t . So it \u2019 s a lack of education , but it \u2019 s also our criminal justice system . As I \u2019 ve learned more about the criminal justice system , I \u2019 ve come to believe it \u2019 s something that \u2019 s going to keep these two Americas separate . \u201d\nPaul continued by saying he specifically blames the politicians , not the police , for the problems .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t blame the police . I blame the politicians , \u201d Paul said . \u201c The politicians write these rules and we can change these rules at any minute . I \u2019 ve said I want to be part of changing some of these rules . I was at the White House last week and met with the president . Now , he and I don \u2019 t agree on a lot of stuff . But on criminal justice , we do . \u201d\nHe said there is only a handful of lawmakers who agree with such changes .\n\u201c One of the laws that bothers me the most is something called civil forfeiture . Civil forfeiture is where the government can take your stuff whether they \u2019 ve convicted you of a crime or not . I think this turns justice on its head . I think that most of our judicial system , for those who believe in it , it \u2019 s that you are innocent until proven guilty . \u201d\nThe audience at the historically black university erupted in applause for Paul .\n\u201c I want to reinforce in our judicial system that you are innocent until proven guilty . And the problem is with civil forfeiture , it \u2019 s the opposite , \u201d Paul added before diving into several examples of people across America who he argues have been wrongly targeted by civil forfeitures .\nOne case he cited involved Christos Sourovelis , a Philadelphia man whose son was caught selling $ 40 worth of drugs off the back porch of his house . In response , the government seized his home\u2014and the case caught national attention , which prompted the authorities to eventually abandon the home seizure under civil asset forfeiture because of the political pressure to do so .\n\u201c Their teenage son sold $ 40 worth of illegal drugs off the back porch , \u201d Paul said . \u201c The government took their house , evicted them and barricaded them . It \u2019 s like , how are we making anything better when we take the house ? Maybe the house is a stabilizing force in the family ? Maybe it \u2019 s grandma \u2019 s house and the kid \u2019 s 15 years old ? Why would we take grandma \u2019 s house ? Why would we take the family \u2019 s house based on not even a conviction but an accusation against a child who doesn \u2019 t even own the house ? It \u2019 s way out of control . \u201d\nPaul \u2019 s express focus on civil asset forfeiture cases in this speech is interesting , given the fact that he \u2019 s also vehemently opposed to U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch \u2019 s nomination to succeed Eric Holder as the next Attorney General of the United States on the grounds she is a leading advocate of using the practice . Lynch , who is black , is in open disagreement with even President Obama over the practice .\nPaul then shifted his speech into another practice he finds to be an encroachment of a big and unruly federal government : mandatory minimum sentencing rules .\n\u201c What mandatory minimums do is say that if you committed an infraction , you have to serve a mandatory sentence of 15 years\u2014sometimes life in prison , \u201d Paul said .\nPaul cited the case of Weldon Angelos , among others , to back up his case . Angelos was in 2004 sentenced to 55 years in federal prison for selling $ 350 worth of marijuana due to a bizarre set of circumstances , and he\u2014like anyone else in federal prison\u2014is ineligible for parole . The judge in the case , a George W. Bush appointee , asked Bush to commute the sentence , calling it \u201c unjust , cruel , and irrational . \u201d\n\u201c That \u2019 s outrageous , 55 years for selling $ 350 worth of marijuana , \u201d Paul said . \u201c You can kill somebody in Kentucky and be eligible for parole within 12 years . Something is wrong here . \u201d\nGenerally speaking , Paul said , he thinks federal judges \u201c should get more discretion . \u201d\n\u201c Most of the judges , Republican and Democrat , are balking at this , \u201d Paul said . \u201c They \u2019 re saying give us discretion to listen to what the young person did , listen to the facts of it , listen to whether they \u2019 re remorseful , listen to whether or not they can work , listen to whether we can have another means other than incarceration . \u201d\nPaul made his argument in a socially conservative way to the Bowie State audience , arguing that it \u2019 s important for families to stick together and for kids to have a proper childhood and upbringing so that future generations can be more successful than prior generations . The current way things work in the criminal justice system\u2013in some cases wrongfully , he argued\u2013splits families apart .\n\u201c In 1980 , there were 300,000 kids in America who didn \u2019 t have a father because their father was in prison , \u201d Paul said . \u201c There \u2019 s now 2 million kids in America who don \u2019 t have a father because their father is in prison . For those who think family structure is good , if we \u2019 re for families with a mother and father around , we need to be for fixing the criminal justice system . \u201d\nPaul then turned to his efforts to get nonviolent ex-convicts back to work in a way that they can be productive to society rather than simply drawing welfare checks because they have a criminal record that prevents them from getting hired .\n\u201c If we look at civil forfeiture , mandatory minimums , and then we look at other problems we have in our society , one of the problems we have is employment , \u201d Paul said . \u201c For us Republicans , we \u2019 re big on saying we don \u2019 t want people permanently on welfare\u2014we want them to transition from welfare to a job . People look back at us and say well how am I supposed to get a job , I \u2019 m a convicted felon . I did my felony when I was 21 , I \u2019 m 40 years old and still nobody will hire me . There has to be a way where we figure out how to get people back to work . \u201d\nThe audience broke into applause again , before Paul told a story about the brother of a friend of his from Kentucky who has found it difficult moving forward with life after a nonviolent drug offense decades ago .\nThus , Paul said , he introduced the REDEEM Act with Sen. Cory Booker ( D-NJ ) .\n\u201c What it does is it takes some of these minor felonies like drug possession and some drug sales , and says if you \u2019 ve been punished\u2014you \u2019 re out of jail and you paid your debt to society\u2014then there \u2019 s a certain time you should get rid of records , \u201d Paul explained his and Booker \u2019 s legislation . \u201c We \u2019 re not talking about violent crimes , we \u2019 re only talking about some nonviolent crimes . We should expunge your records so you can get back to work . The bill also , that I have with Cory Booker , it gets rid of solitary confinement for teenagers . \u201d\nApplause broke out again , before Paul shifted to another bill he \u2019 s leading called the RESET Bill that aims to reclassify some nonviolent infractions currently listed as felonies as misdemeanors .\n\u201c I also think that part of the problem with losing your ability to get employment , and losing your ability to vote is because we have a lot of things that are felonies that could be misdemeanors , \u201d Paul said . \u201c So I have what we call the RESET Bill and we take some felonies\u2014mostly minor , all nonviolent , but mostly drug felonies\u2014and we make them misdemeanors . We \u2019 re not saying it \u2019 s legal . We \u2019 re just saying it \u2019 ll be a misdemeanor . You will never lose your right to vote and you won \u2019 t lose forever your opportunity to work by having it permanently on your record . These are things that if we do we can radically transform our country . \u201d\nAnd Paul then shifted into his efforts to grant voting rights back to some nonviolent felons .\n\u201c The number one thing precluding people from voting is a felony conviction , \u201d Paul said . \u201c So I have a bill with Harry Reid that would restore federal voting rights if you \u2019 ve served your time for a nonviolent felony and you \u2019 re behaving yourself , you can get your voting rights back . I think it \u2019 s hard for people to feel like they \u2019 re part of the America that has life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness if they can \u2019 t vote . So we want people to be able to work , we want people to be able to vote . \u201d\nPaul then turned into laying out conservative economic and constitutional principles that he argues are necessary to protect not just the black community in the audience he was speaking to , but all Americans .\n\u201c How do we protect all of these things and how do we make it a better , more united America ? I think we have to pay more attention to the Bill of Rights , \u201d Paul said . \u201c The Bill of Rights is there to protect all of us\u2026 It \u2019 s for the least popular among you . It \u2019 s for those who might have unorthodox ideas . It \u2019 s precisely for minorities . And you can be a minority because of the shade of your skin , or you can be a minority because of the shade of your ideology . You can be a minority because you \u2019 re African American or Hispanic , but you can also be a minority because you \u2019 re an evangelical Christian . There \u2019 s all kinds of instances where you can have minority opinions that need to be protected . The Bill of Rights should do this . \u201d\nWhile criticizing what \u2019 s called \u201c indefinite detention \u201d \u2014which Paul describes as how the federal government can take an American citizen right now and send them \u201c to Guantanamo Bay forever without a trial \u201d \u2014Paul questioned whether having such laws on the books could be dangerous .\n\u201c I had a debate on this with another senator on the floor and I said really , you can send an American citizen to Guantanamo Bay forever with no trial ever ? And he said , yeah , if they \u2019 re dangerous . So it begs the question , doesn \u2019 t it , who gets to decide who \u2019 s dangerous and who isn \u2019 t ? \u201d Paul said , referencing a fight he had recently with Sen. John McCain ( R-AZ ) on the Senate floor .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think this president is going to round up people of a race\u2014and that \u2019 s what he said when he signed the legislation , he said \u2018 but I \u2019 m a good man and I will never do this , \u2019 \u201d Paul added . \u201c I \u2019 m not questioning whether the president is a good man . I \u2019 m questioning whether you want a law on the book that requires our leaders to be good people . \u201d\nPaul then brought up the Founding Fathers , citing James Madison \u2019 s writings about the then-young Republican and warnings he had for the future about the potential for the abuse of power .\n\u201c There have been times in our history when we have let down our guard . Madison wrote about this when Madison said that if government were comprised of angels , we wouldn \u2019 t need these laws , \u201d Paul said . \u201c We \u2019 d be fine . If government were comprised of angels , it wouldn \u2019 t matter if there was a potential for bias . Remember the times when you didn \u2019 t get due process . Remember the times in our country when there were groups like Japanese Americans in World War II who didn \u2019 t get due process and were incarcerated without trials . That \u2019 s why we have these rules . If it \u2019 s not this president , it \u2019 s the next president or the next president or the president thereafter . \u201d\nPaul also laid out how he believes the NSA spying program , where Americans \u2019 cell phone records are being collected by the federal government on a massive scale , is something he thinks \u201c goes against justice and the ideas of justice . \u201d\n\u201c Every one of your phone records is being collected and stored . Every cell phone record probably in America . They won \u2019 t tell us , but in all likelihood the vast majority of phone records are being collected , \u201d Paul said . \u201c But if you look at the warrant , it doesn \u2019 t have your name on it . If you look at the Fourth Amendment , it says it \u2019 s supposed to have your name . It \u2019 s supposed to specify who you are , what you did , what they want to look at and then they go to a judge and they ask for probable cause . But you know what the warrant says that has all of your phone records ? It says Verizon on it . I don \u2019 t know anybody named \u2018 Mr . Verizon. \u2019 I don \u2019 t think you can write one single warrant and get the records of 20 million people , or 50 million people \u2019 s records . In fact , we fought the Revolution over this . In the Revolution , they called these things \u2018 writs of assistance. \u2019 They were generalized warrants . That \u2019 s why we wrote the Fourth Amendment . \u201d\nPaul said that without these \u201c Constitutional protections \u201d in place , more and more minority groups\u2014whether racial , ethnic , religious , or otherwise a minority\u2014could be targeted wrongfully at some point in the future .\n\u201c Think about what happened in the 1960s . Think about how Martin Luther King \u2019 s phone was tapped , \u201d Paul said . \u201c Think about how hundreds of people involved in the Civil Rights Movement had their phones tapped . Think about how many people who protested against the war had their phones tapped . You have to have these protections not because there is one particularly bad person in government , but because there is the potential for bad people some day to take charge of government . \u201d\nPaul went on to note that his arguments for criminal justice reform are not along racial lines , but because of the fact that under the thumb of big government the black community across America has struggled economically for decades\u2014and it \u2019 s conservative education and economic policies that are what \u2019 s needed to bring vibrancy back to the black community and inner cities .\n\u201c Criminal justice is not a black or white problem . It \u2019 s not a black or brown problem , \u201d Paul said . \u201c What it is is it \u2019 s a poverty problem . But the thing is we have to be careful to make sure that the Bill of Rights applies to every individual and if there \u2019 s one thing I want to get across to you is it \u2019 s we have to defend the Bill of Rights . \u201d\nWith regard to education , Paul pushed for school choice and for education to be up to the parents\u2014meaning no Common Core standards written by Washington bureaucrats from what Paul called the \u201c educational establishment \u201d \u2014and argued that only when this happens will there be a chance for true equality in education .\n\u201c How do we equalize education ? Education is the great equalizer , \u201d Paul said . \u201c We fought for Brown V. Board of Education in the \u2019 50s and we got the schools together and we got integration , but there still is a lack of equality in the schools , there \u2019 s no other way to put it\u2026 A lot of the problem I think can only be fixed if we allow more innovation . That means less rules from Washington . Allow competition and allow people to choose which schools they go to in each of the cities . If there \u2019 s a better school in the suburbs , let people drive out to the suburbs if they want to go to that school . School choice will allow schools to be equal , but right now I think our concern is that the people making the decisions are the educational establishment and not the parents . \u201d\nPaul wrapped up his speech by discussing what he calls \u201c economic freedom zones \u201d \u2014a stimulus package where instead of the government injecting taxpayer cash into an economically deprived area , the government cuts taxes and regulations dramatically so businesses can grow freely quickly\u2014and how those would revive downtrodden inner cities like nearby Baltimore or Detroit .\n\u201c Finally , what we have to do is we have to figure out how to get economic equality , \u201d Paul said . \u201c I \u2019 m not talking about some sort of equality of outcome , I \u2019 m talking more about equality of opportunity . I think that we have to look at something new . We \u2019 ve tried passing money out\u2014look at my state . Appalachia has gotten money for 60 years . We tax everybody in the country and then we send it to Appalachia . It \u2019 s still poor , Appalachia is still as poor as it ever was . We have pockets of poverty in Louisville that are just as poor as they ever were .\n\u201c The problem is if you give me the money and ask me to give it to somebody , people don \u2019 t know who to give it to . You give it to John Smith and say open a business and we don \u2019 t know if John Smith or Mary Smith is good at opening a business . The marketplace does though . Every day when you go out and you spend your money in a restaurant or a Wal-Mart or a Target or a K-Mart , you \u2019 re spending your money and you \u2019 re voting on which businesses will succeed . So I say if we want to stimulate Detroit\u2014Detroit \u2019 s got 20 percent unemployment , thousands of acres of abandoned housing\u2014so if we want to do something for Detroit , why don \u2019 t we dramatically cut the taxes for Detroit . \u201d\nThe audience applauded loudly before Paul explained more about his idea .\n\u201c Jack Kemp was the first person to really talk about something like this , he called them enterprise zones , \u201d Paul said . \u201c I call them freedom zones . What we do is we take tax cuts to areas that have high unemployment , low growth and high poverty and then what we do is we dramatically cut the taxes\u2014not a little bit , but almost completely wipe out federal taxes so they can have more money . So in Detroit it \u2019 d be a $ 1.3 billion tax cut . For Baltimore , it \u2019 d be a $ 900 million tax cut over 10 years . \u201d\n\u201c Why does this work better than a government stimulus ? \u201d Paul said . \u201c We tried a government stimulus\u2014we did it four or five years ago\u2014we gave a bunch of money , almost a trillion dollars , I think it was $ 800 billion we gave out . But we didn \u2019 t know who to give it to . So when we divided it up , it was about $ 400,000 per job . But if you give it back to the people who are already succeeding\u2014look at Baltimore . Even though Baltimore has pockets of poverty , there are businesses there that are succeeding . We don \u2019 t give it to the brand new person who we won \u2019 t know whether they \u2019 ll be good at business , [ instead ] give it to the person who \u2019 s already in business and they \u2019 ll hire more people . \u201d\nPaul ended the address by laying out how he believes \u201c the two Americas that Martin Luther King talked about can come back together \u201d and that because of an \u201c undercurrent of unease \u201d in America due to big government , he thinks \u201c it \u2019 s imperative that we do it . \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 ve been to Ferguson , I \u2019 ve been to Chicago and Detroit and other places with a great deal of poverty , \u201d Paul said . \u201c Some of this is government\u2014government has done the wrong things sometimes , politicians . Police are just trying to do their jobs for the most part but the politicians have done a bad job of creating criminal justice and we need to try to fix that . We need to fix our educational system but we can \u2019 t just let the establishment say we \u2019 re not going to let it change\u2014that \u2019 s what \u2019 s been going on for 30 years now and until we allow innovation we won \u2019 t get better . And finally we have to have the debate about who best spends money . Are the politicians smart enough to know how to spend it ? Or should we send it back to Baltimore ? Do we want to make Baltimore richer ? Leave more money in Baltimore . Can we make Baltimore richer and have more jobs by not sending it to Washington in the first place ?\n\u201c I \u2019 m a big believer in freedom , I \u2019 m a big believer in ingenuity , I \u2019 d say if we give more freedom back to the people , we \u2019 ll see success like we haven \u2019 t seen in a long time . \u201d\nThe audience rose in applause yet again , giving him a standing ovation before he took questions via a moderator .",
    "content_original": "BOWIE, Maryland \u2014 Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) was a hit speaker on the campus of Bowie State University on Friday, earning several rounds of applause and a standing ovation for the conservative message he delivered to a predominantly liberal audience at the historically black university\u2014part of an outreach effort to traditionally non-Republican communities the senator and potential 2016 GOP presidential candidate has been engaged in nationwide for the five-plus years he\u2019s been in the U.S. Senate.\n\nPaul wove individual examples of people throughout history and in modern times who have faced unfair consequences as a result of government\u2019s heavy hand, making his case to the room on the basis of the need to defend the full Bill of Rights in the Constitution\u2014a classic Tea Party style of speech\u2014all while citing the Founding Fathers, and making economic and social limited government conservative pitch that seemed to resonate throughout the theater inside the student center.\n\n\u201cClyde Canard got out of prison the same month that I was born, which was a long time ago, in 1963,\u201d Paul opened his speech with after a couple thank-yous to organizers. \u201cThe reason that Clyde Canard went to prison is that, his crime was he was trying to get enrolled in Mississippi Southern. At that time, it was very difficult for a black man or a woman to enroll. The second time he tried to enroll they planted liquor on him\u2014he didn\u2019t drink\u2014and gave him a $600 fine. Can you imagine what $600 was like in 1963 if you were poor in Mississippi? One thing led to another and he declared bankruptcy. He tried to enroll a third time and he was arrested and bullied by police. But when he tried the third time, he\u2019s declared bankruptcy and he goes by his farm to pick up some chicken feed\u2014$25 worth of chicken feed\u2014and you know what happens to him? He\u2019s arrested, and you know what kind of prison term he\u2019s given? Seven years in prison for stealing $25 worth of chicken feed which really was his\u2014it was on his land which the bank was repossessing. People\u2019s lives can spiral out of control from a $600 fine.\u201d\n\nPaul noted that \u201ca lot of things have improved since\u201d 1963, when this particular example happened\u2014specifically the fact that the United States has gotten rid of segregation by law. However, he said, \u201cwe still have a problem in our country that\u2019s a lot like segregation but it\u2019s also like there are two systems.\u201d\n\nThe major theme of Paul\u2019s speech was a comparison back to the speech of Martin Luther King, Jr., in 1967, where the Civil Rights icon argued there are \u201ctwo Americas.\u201d Paul\u2019s argument is due to the criminal justice system, the so-called \u201ceducational establishment\u201d in Washington as he called it, and especially due to poverty and economic depravity in certain areas of the country, all symptoms of a larger problem that\u2019s created by an out-of-touch political class that\u2019s not interested in addressing the heart of the matter: there are Americans of all races and creeds who succeed in life and there are Americans of all races and creeds who don\u2019t. And it\u2019s unfair to those who don\u2019t have a chance at success, he argued, because of a system that\u2019s been created and abused by politicians.\n\n\u201cAs Martin Luther King said in 1967, there are two Americas,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThere\u2019s one America that believes in life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. But there\u2019s another America that is witness to a daily disgrace, a lack of hope, and despair. Why? Because like Clyde Canard, there are still people in our society who are being hounded by fines, hounded by this and that.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s notable is that Paul talked about his time in Ferguson, Missouri, and in other black communities across America\u2014but did not blame the police for the problems. In fact, he stood for the police as law enforcement officers just trying to do their jobs\u2014and laid out how the government as a whole, and the politicians who run it, are the real source of the problems facing the second and less fortunate of the \u201ctwo Americas\u201d he spoke of.\n\n\u201cSeveral cities in Missouri, over a third of their budget is gotten by fines,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIn Ferguson, there\u2019s 21,000 people. Last year, there were 31,000 arrests. I tell people it isn\u2019t just about what happened this year. It\u2019s about this building up, it\u2019s about this gradual increase. I call it an undercurrent of unease in our country. There still are two Americas. Most of the people here are part of the America that does believe and can believe in life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Those who get a college education, those who get an education no matter the color of your skin, you are part of the America that can live the American dream. But there are many people who aren\u2019t. So it\u2019s a lack of education, but it\u2019s also our criminal justice system. As I\u2019ve learned more about the criminal justice system, I\u2019ve come to believe it\u2019s something that\u2019s going to keep these two Americas separate.\u201d\n\nPaul continued by saying he specifically blames the politicians, not the police, for the problems.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame the police. I blame the politicians,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThe politicians write these rules and we can change these rules at any minute. I\u2019ve said I want to be part of changing some of these rules. I was at the White House last week and met with the president. Now, he and I don\u2019t agree on a lot of stuff. But on criminal justice, we do.\u201d\n\nHe said there is only a handful of lawmakers who agree with such changes.\n\n\u201cOne of the laws that bothers me the most is something called civil forfeiture. Civil forfeiture is where the government can take your stuff whether they\u2019ve convicted you of a crime or not. I think this turns justice on its head. I think that most of our judicial system, for those who believe in it, it\u2019s that you are innocent until proven guilty.\u201d\n\nThe audience at the historically black university erupted in applause for Paul.\n\n\u201cI want to reinforce in our judicial system that you are innocent until proven guilty. And the problem is with civil forfeiture, it\u2019s the opposite,\u201d Paul added before diving into several examples of people across America who he argues have been wrongly targeted by civil forfeitures.\n\nOne case he cited involved Christos Sourovelis, a Philadelphia man whose son was caught selling $40 worth of drugs off the back porch of his house. In response, the government seized his home\u2014and the case caught national attention, which prompted the authorities to eventually abandon the home seizure under civil asset forfeiture because of the political pressure to do so.\n\n\u201cTheir teenage son sold $40 worth of illegal drugs off the back porch,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThe government took their house, evicted them and barricaded them. It\u2019s like, how are we making anything better when we take the house? Maybe the house is a stabilizing force in the family? Maybe it\u2019s grandma\u2019s house and the kid\u2019s 15 years old? Why would we take grandma\u2019s house? Why would we take the family\u2019s house based on not even a conviction but an accusation against a child who doesn\u2019t even own the house? It\u2019s way out of control.\u201d\n\nPaul\u2019s express focus on civil asset forfeiture cases in this speech is interesting, given the fact that he\u2019s also vehemently opposed to U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch\u2019s nomination to succeed Eric Holder as the next Attorney General of the United States on the grounds she is a leading advocate of using the practice. Lynch, who is black, is in open disagreement with even President Obama over the practice.\n\nPaul then shifted his speech into another practice he finds to be an encroachment of a big and unruly federal government: mandatory minimum sentencing rules.\n\n\u201cWhat mandatory minimums do is say that if you committed an infraction, you have to serve a mandatory sentence of 15 years\u2014sometimes life in prison,\u201d Paul said.\n\nPaul cited the case of Weldon Angelos, among others, to back up his case. Angelos was in 2004 sentenced to 55 years in federal prison for selling $350 worth of marijuana due to a bizarre set of circumstances, and he\u2014like anyone else in federal prison\u2014is ineligible for parole. The judge in the case, a George W. Bush appointee, asked Bush to commute the sentence, calling it \u201cunjust, cruel, and irrational.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s outrageous, 55 years for selling $350 worth of marijuana,\u201d Paul said. \u201cYou can kill somebody in Kentucky and be eligible for parole within 12 years. Something is wrong here.\u201d\n\nGenerally speaking, Paul said, he thinks federal judges \u201cshould get more discretion.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost of the judges, Republican and Democrat, are balking at this,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThey\u2019re saying give us discretion to listen to what the young person did, listen to the facts of it, listen to whether they\u2019re remorseful, listen to whether or not they can work, listen to whether we can have another means other than incarceration.\u201d\n\nPaul made his argument in a socially conservative way to the Bowie State audience, arguing that it\u2019s important for families to stick together and for kids to have a proper childhood and upbringing so that future generations can be more successful than prior generations. The current way things work in the criminal justice system\u2013in some cases wrongfully, he argued\u2013splits families apart.\n\n\u201cIn 1980, there were 300,000 kids in America who didn\u2019t have a father because their father was in prison,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThere\u2019s now 2 million kids in America who don\u2019t have a father because their father is in prison. For those who think family structure is good, if we\u2019re for families with a mother and father around, we need to be for fixing the criminal justice system.\u201d\n\nPaul then turned to his efforts to get nonviolent ex-convicts back to work in a way that they can be productive to society rather than simply drawing welfare checks because they have a criminal record that prevents them from getting hired.\n\n\u201cIf we look at civil forfeiture, mandatory minimums, and then we look at other problems we have in our society, one of the problems we have is employment,\u201d Paul said. \u201cFor us Republicans, we\u2019re big on saying we don\u2019t want people permanently on welfare\u2014we want them to transition from welfare to a job. People look back at us and say well how am I supposed to get a job, I\u2019m a convicted felon. I did my felony when I was 21, I\u2019m 40 years old and still nobody will hire me. There has to be a way where we figure out how to get people back to work.\u201d\n\nThe audience broke into applause again, before Paul told a story about the brother of a friend of his from Kentucky who has found it difficult moving forward with life after a nonviolent drug offense decades ago.\n\nThus, Paul said, he introduced the REDEEM Act with Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ).\n\n\u201cWhat it does is it takes some of these minor felonies like drug possession and some drug sales, and says if you\u2019ve been punished\u2014you\u2019re out of jail and you paid your debt to society\u2014then there\u2019s a certain time you should get rid of records,\u201d Paul explained his and Booker\u2019s legislation. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about violent crimes, we\u2019re only talking about some nonviolent crimes. We should expunge your records so you can get back to work. The bill also, that I have with Cory Booker, it gets rid of solitary confinement for teenagers.\u201d\n\nApplause broke out again, before Paul shifted to another bill he\u2019s leading called the RESET Bill that aims to reclassify some nonviolent infractions currently listed as felonies as misdemeanors.\n\n\u201cI also think that part of the problem with losing your ability to get employment, and losing your ability to vote is because we have a lot of things that are felonies that could be misdemeanors,\u201d Paul said. \u201cSo I have what we call the RESET Bill and we take some felonies\u2014mostly minor, all nonviolent, but mostly drug felonies\u2014and we make them misdemeanors. We\u2019re not saying it\u2019s legal. We\u2019re just saying it\u2019ll be a misdemeanor. You will never lose your right to vote and you won\u2019t lose forever your opportunity to work by having it permanently on your record. These are things that if we do we can radically transform our country.\u201d\n\nAnd Paul then shifted into his efforts to grant voting rights back to some nonviolent felons.\n\n\u201cThe number one thing precluding people from voting is a felony conviction,\u201d Paul said. \u201cSo I have a bill with Harry Reid that would restore federal voting rights if you\u2019ve served your time for a nonviolent felony and you\u2019re behaving yourself, you can get your voting rights back. I think it\u2019s hard for people to feel like they\u2019re part of the America that has life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness if they can\u2019t vote. So we want people to be able to work, we want people to be able to vote.\u201d\n\nPaul then turned into laying out conservative economic and constitutional principles that he argues are necessary to protect not just the black community in the audience he was speaking to, but all Americans.\n\n\u201cHow do we protect all of these things and how do we make it a better, more united America? I think we have to pay more attention to the Bill of Rights,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThe Bill of Rights is there to protect all of us\u2026 It\u2019s for the least popular among you. It\u2019s for those who might have unorthodox ideas. It\u2019s precisely for minorities. And you can be a minority because of the shade of your skin, or you can be a minority because of the shade of your ideology. You can be a minority because you\u2019re African American or Hispanic, but you can also be a minority because you\u2019re an evangelical Christian. There\u2019s all kinds of instances where you can have minority opinions that need to be protected. The Bill of Rights should do this.\u201d\n\nWhile criticizing what\u2019s called \u201cindefinite detention\u201d\u2014which Paul describes as how the federal government can take an American citizen right now and send them \u201cto Guantanamo Bay forever without a trial\u201d\u2014Paul questioned whether having such laws on the books could be dangerous.\n\n\u201cI had a debate on this with another senator on the floor and I said really, you can send an American citizen to Guantanamo Bay forever with no trial ever? And he said, yeah, if they\u2019re dangerous. So it begs the question, doesn\u2019t it, who gets to decide who\u2019s dangerous and who isn\u2019t?\u201d Paul said, referencing a fight he had recently with Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) on the Senate floor.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this president is going to round up people of a race\u2014and that\u2019s what he said when he signed the legislation, he said \u2018but I\u2019m a good man and I will never do this,\u2019\u201d Paul added. \u201cI\u2019m not questioning whether the president is a good man. I\u2019m questioning whether you want a law on the book that requires our leaders to be good people.\u201d\n\nPaul then brought up the Founding Fathers, citing James Madison\u2019s writings about the then-young Republican and warnings he had for the future about the potential for the abuse of power.\n\n\u201cThere have been times in our history when we have let down our guard. Madison wrote about this when Madison said that if government were comprised of angels, we wouldn\u2019t need these laws,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWe\u2019d be fine. If government were comprised of angels, it wouldn\u2019t matter if there was a potential for bias. Remember the times when you didn\u2019t get due process. Remember the times in our country when there were groups like Japanese Americans in World War II who didn\u2019t get due process and were incarcerated without trials. That\u2019s why we have these rules. If it\u2019s not this president, it\u2019s the next president or the next president or the president thereafter.\u201d\n\nPaul also laid out how he believes the NSA spying program, where Americans\u2019 cell phone records are being collected by the federal government on a massive scale, is something he thinks \u201cgoes against justice and the ideas of justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery one of your phone records is being collected and stored. Every cell phone record probably in America. They won\u2019t tell us, but in all likelihood the vast majority of phone records are being collected,\u201d Paul said. \u201cBut if you look at the warrant, it doesn\u2019t have your name on it. If you look at the Fourth Amendment, it says it\u2019s supposed to have your name. It\u2019s supposed to specify who you are, what you did, what they want to look at and then they go to a judge and they ask for probable cause. But you know what the warrant says that has all of your phone records? It says Verizon on it. I don\u2019t know anybody named \u2018Mr. Verizon.\u2019 I don\u2019t think you can write one single warrant and get the records of 20 million people, or 50 million people\u2019s records. In fact, we fought the Revolution over this. In the Revolution, they called these things \u2018writs of assistance.\u2019 They were generalized warrants. That\u2019s why we wrote the Fourth Amendment.\u201d\n\nPaul said that without these \u201cConstitutional protections\u201d in place, more and more minority groups\u2014whether racial, ethnic, religious, or otherwise a minority\u2014could be targeted wrongfully at some point in the future.\n\n\u201cThink about what happened in the 1960s. Think about how Martin Luther King\u2019s phone was tapped,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThink about how hundreds of people involved in the Civil Rights Movement had their phones tapped. Think about how many people who protested against the war had their phones tapped. You have to have these protections not because there is one particularly bad person in government, but because there is the potential for bad people some day to take charge of government.\u201d\n\nPaul went on to note that his arguments for criminal justice reform are not along racial lines, but because of the fact that under the thumb of big government the black community across America has struggled economically for decades\u2014and it\u2019s conservative education and economic policies that are what\u2019s needed to bring vibrancy back to the black community and inner cities.\n\n\u201cCriminal justice is not a black or white problem. It\u2019s not a black or brown problem,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWhat it is is it\u2019s a poverty problem. But the thing is we have to be careful to make sure that the Bill of Rights applies to every individual and if there\u2019s one thing I want to get across to you is it\u2019s we have to defend the Bill of Rights.\u201d\n\nWith regard to education, Paul pushed for school choice and for education to be up to the parents\u2014meaning no Common Core standards written by Washington bureaucrats from what Paul called the \u201ceducational establishment\u201d\u2014and argued that only when this happens will there be a chance for true equality in education.\n\n\u201cHow do we equalize education? Education is the great equalizer,\u201d Paul said. \u201cWe fought for Brown V. Board of Education in the \u201950s and we got the schools together and we got integration, but there still is a lack of equality in the schools, there\u2019s no other way to put it\u2026 A lot of the problem I think can only be fixed if we allow more innovation. That means less rules from Washington. Allow competition and allow people to choose which schools they go to in each of the cities. If there\u2019s a better school in the suburbs, let people drive out to the suburbs if they want to go to that school. School choice will allow schools to be equal, but right now I think our concern is that the people making the decisions are the educational establishment and not the parents.\u201d\n\nPaul wrapped up his speech by discussing what he calls \u201ceconomic freedom zones\u201d\u2014a stimulus package where instead of the government injecting taxpayer cash into an economically deprived area, the government cuts taxes and regulations dramatically so businesses can grow freely quickly\u2014and how those would revive downtrodden inner cities like nearby Baltimore or Detroit.\n\n\u201cFinally, what we have to do is we have to figure out how to get economic equality,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about some sort of equality of outcome, I\u2019m talking more about equality of opportunity. I think that we have to look at something new. We\u2019ve tried passing money out\u2014look at my state. Appalachia has gotten money for 60 years. We tax everybody in the country and then we send it to Appalachia. It\u2019s still poor, Appalachia is still as poor as it ever was. We have pockets of poverty in Louisville that are just as poor as they ever were.\n\n\u201cThe problem is if you give me the money and ask me to give it to somebody, people don\u2019t know who to give it to. You give it to John Smith and say open a business and we don\u2019t know if John Smith or Mary Smith is good at opening a business. The marketplace does though. Every day when you go out and you spend your money in a restaurant or a Wal-Mart or a Target or a K-Mart, you\u2019re spending your money and you\u2019re voting on which businesses will succeed. So I say if we want to stimulate Detroit\u2014Detroit\u2019s got 20 percent unemployment, thousands of acres of abandoned housing\u2014so if we want to do something for Detroit, why don\u2019t we dramatically cut the taxes for Detroit.\u201d\n\nThe audience applauded loudly before Paul explained more about his idea.\n\n\u201cJack Kemp was the first person to really talk about something like this, he called them enterprise zones,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI call them freedom zones. What we do is we take tax cuts to areas that have high unemployment, low growth and high poverty and then what we do is we dramatically cut the taxes\u2014not a little bit, but almost completely wipe out federal taxes so they can have more money. So in Detroit it\u2019d be a $1.3 billion tax cut. For Baltimore, it\u2019d be a $900 million tax cut over 10 years.\u201d\n\nThe audience erupted in applause again.\n\n\u201cWhy does this work better than a government stimulus?\u201d Paul said. \u201cWe tried a government stimulus\u2014we did it four or five years ago\u2014we gave a bunch of money, almost a trillion dollars, I think it was $800 billion we gave out. But we didn\u2019t know who to give it to. So when we divided it up, it was about $400,000 per job. But if you give it back to the people who are already succeeding\u2014look at Baltimore. Even though Baltimore has pockets of poverty, there are businesses there that are succeeding. We don\u2019t give it to the brand new person who we won\u2019t know whether they\u2019ll be good at business, [instead] give it to the person who\u2019s already in business and they\u2019ll hire more people.\u201d\n\nPaul ended the address by laying out how he believes \u201cthe two Americas that Martin Luther King talked about can come back together\u201d and that because of an \u201cundercurrent of unease\u201d in America due to big government, he thinks \u201cit\u2019s imperative that we do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to Ferguson, I\u2019ve been to Chicago and Detroit and other places with a great deal of poverty,\u201d Paul said. \u201cSome of this is government\u2014government has done the wrong things sometimes, politicians. Police are just trying to do their jobs for the most part but the politicians have done a bad job of creating criminal justice and we need to try to fix that. We need to fix our educational system but we can\u2019t just let the establishment say we\u2019re not going to let it change\u2014that\u2019s what\u2019s been going on for 30 years now and until we allow innovation we won\u2019t get better. And finally we have to have the debate about who best spends money. Are the politicians smart enough to know how to spend it? Or should we send it back to Baltimore? Do we want to make Baltimore richer? Leave more money in Baltimore. Can we make Baltimore richer and have more jobs by not sending it to Washington in the first place?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a big believer in freedom, I\u2019m a big believer in ingenuity, I\u2019d say if we give more freedom back to the people, we\u2019ll see success like we haven\u2019t seen in a long time.\u201d\n\nThe audience rose in applause yet again, giving him a standing ovation before he took questions via a moderator.\n\nWatch Rand Paul\u2019s full speech via C-SPAN.",
