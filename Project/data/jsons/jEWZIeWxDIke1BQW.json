    "content": "Jennifer Chang got into investing in 2019 , but it was only during the pandemic that she started dealing in options trading , where the risk is higher , but so is the reward .\n\u201c With options , you can make money so much faster . So I was then having days where I would make $ 1,000 a day , and then I made $ 10,000 in a day , \u201d she said . \u201c And then I started getting really cocky , and I didn \u2019 t even think I could even lose so much money . Then during the day when it was like we had a really big drop , I lost everything I had made . \u201d\nChang , 39 , lost her job at a nonprofit in the financial downturn , fell down a \u201c rabbit hole of stock videos \u201d on YouTube , and by now has put about $ 25,000 into the trading app Robinhood . The day we spoke , she was basically back where she started . \u201c I take it in stride , because it \u2019 s money I had made , but it wasn \u2019 t really there . \u201d\nShe is not an anomaly . In recent months , the stock market has seen a boom in retail trading . Online brokerages have reported a record number of new accounts and a big uptick in trading activity . People are bored at home , sports betting and casinos are largely off the table , and many look at that $ 1,200 stimulus check they got earlier this year as free money . Some are taking cues from mainstream sources like the Wall Street Journal and CNBC , others are looking at Reddit and Barstool Sports \u2019 Dave Portnoy for ideas ( and entertainment ) . And commission-free trading on gamified apps makes investing easy and appealing , even addicting .\n\u201c It \u2019 s kind of scary , because I am unemployed right now , I don \u2019 t want to put too much at risk . But I think I have enough in savings that I \u2019 m willing to take that risk a little bit , because I also really like gambling , \u201d Chang said . She \u2019 s not sure what all of this will mean for her taxes .\nI spoke with more than a dozen traders about where they \u2019 re putting their money , why , and how it \u2019 s going . Some are doing well , while others have learned some hard lessons already , and they \u2019 re aware things can get out of control \u2014 most of the people I talked to referenced a 20-year-old Robinhood trader who died by suicide in June after believing he \u2019 d lost hundreds of thousands of dollars on the app . Still , for a lot of them , it \u2019 s largely a game .\n\u201c It \u2019 s boring watching stocks , it \u2019 s not exciting , they \u2019 re not making these crazy prices , \u201d said Adam Barker , a 31-year-old software engineer in Massachusetts . \u201c You don \u2019 t get a rush throwing money at Berkshire Hathaway and waiting 15 years . \u201d\nWhatever the strategy of this new crop of traders \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 they have Wall Street \u2019 s attention . They remain a small portion of the market , but there is evidence they \u2019 re making a difference along the margins . They \u2019 ve ignored predictions from high-profile investors that another crash is on the horizon , and thus far , they \u2019 ve been right . Many of them relish in their battle against the \u201c suits \u201d to prove that anyone can play in stocks .\nThere \u2019 s been plenty of finger-wagging in their direction : Billionaire investor Leon Cooperman in June said they \u2019 re just doing \u201c stupid things \u201d and that the momentum will \u201c end in tears. \u201d Oaktree Capital co-founder Howard Marks warned it \u2019 s \u201c not healthy to have people buying stocks for fun . \u201d\nWhile there \u2019 s certainly cause for concern some might be in over their heads , it \u2019 s also hard to argue that financial opportunity should be cordoned off for institutions and the rich , especially in an economy plagued by inequality where financial mobility , for many , is a myth .\nTraditionally , stock-trading has come with a fee , meaning if you wanted to buy or sell , you had to pay for each transaction . But companies like Robinhood have taken a jackhammer to that system by offering commission-free trading . Other major online brokers \u2014 Charles Schwab , E-Trade , and TD Ameritrade \u2014 have followed suit . Many brokerages are also letting people buy fractional shares , so if you don \u2019 t have the $ 3,000 to invest in Amazon stock , you can put in $ 300 to buy one-tenth of it .\nTrading isn \u2019 t really free , and big market-makers like Citadel Securities and Virtu Financial pay millions of dollars to process the trades and put them back onto the market , making money off of the spread \u2014 the price difference between the buy and the sell . Nathaniel Popper at the New York Times recently outlined how Robinhood makes money off of its customers , and more than other brokerages .\n\u201c It gives the appearance that you \u2019 re not paying a commission , but it \u2019 s just hidden , \u201d said Jim Bianco , president and macro strategist at Bianco Research .\nBut the perception that it \u2019 s frictionless and free has helped boost retail trading , and during the pandemic , people have flocked to trading platforms to try their hand at the market . Robinhood , in particular , has become representative of the retail trading boom . The platform , founded by Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt in 2013 and launched in 2015 , says it has about 10 million approved customer accounts , many of whom are new to the market . Its mission is to \u201c democratize finance for all , \u201d according to its website . \u201c We fundamentally believe participation is power , and that the stock market can be an important wealth creation engine , \u201d a spokesperson for Robinhood said .\nRobinhood \u2019 s version of financial democratization feels deliberately like a game . When you sign up , it offers you a free stock , generally under $ 10 , and encourages you to invite your friends to get more free stocks . The screen turns green when you \u2019 re up and red when you \u2019 re down , and when you trade , it sometimes sends you confetti and gives you the money instantly so you can trade again . It \u2019 s easy to see how people get sucked in fast .\n\u201c Robinhood feels very gamified . The act of trading stocks was boring for a really long time , and even today , if you do it through Charles Schwab , it would seem boring . Robinhood makes it feel frictionless and fun and easy , and it can be very , very addicting , \u201d said Noah Whinston , who founded an eSports franchise . He does some trading for fun on Robinhood but does most of his investments through a financial adviser . \u201c I \u2019 m well aware if I put a lot of money into Robinhood , I might allocate that in ways that are not the smartest but instead based on short-term serotonin hits . \u201d\nSome people are able to resist the temptation , like Nate Brown , 23 . He got his first job out of college working in government tech and decided to try out investing . \u201c I buy stocks once a month , so probably not as often as you \u2019 d expect just because I \u2019 m trying to follow that longer trend , \u201d he said . \u201c I saw the options thing on the app , but it honestly kind of scares me . \u201d\nBut Brown seems more like the exception in this current cohort of day traders , not the rule . What they \u2019 re doing isn \u2019 t really investing , it \u2019 s gambling .\n\u201c It \u2019 s the same exact rush you get sitting down at a blackjack table , \u201d said Luke Lloyd , a wealth adviser at Strategic Wealth Partners . He says he worries about a new generation of traders getting addicted to the excitement . \u201c It \u2019 s like putting all of your money on one number at the roulette table . \u201d\nSome traders have become especially enticed by more complex maneuvers and vehicles . A big draw appears to be options trading , which gives traders the right to buy or sell shares of something in a certain period . People can use options to hedge their portfolios , but most of the traders I talked to were using them to make bets as to whether a stock would go up ( a call ) or go down ( a put ) and inject some extra adrenaline into the process .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a lot of risk involved , and you can definitely see why people get into the gambling side of things . It \u2019 s definitely the rush , \u201d Barker , the Massachusetts software engineer , said . He kicked about half of his stimulus check into Robinhood and is mainly trading options . \u201c I \u2019 m not really in it for the long term . \u201d\nThe Robinhood spokesperson said the company believes it \u2019 s \u201c time to move away from the notion \u201d that it \u2019 s gambling or gaming and disputed that the app is gamified , instead saying that what it has is \u201c accessible , modern design. \u201d The spokesperson emphasized that it doesn \u2019 t display confetti for every trade and disputed that confetti is a reward , but instead is \u201c celebrating the achievement \u201d of participating in markets . The company also said most of its customers aren \u2019 t day traders and that of the customers who trade in any given month , 12 percent make an options trade on average .\nReddit and Dave Portnoy , the new kings of the day traders ?\nTraditionally , investors have been told to read the Wall Street Journal and comb through corporate filings to make decisions . This new cohort of traders has other ideas \u2014 some are swapping the Financial Times for Reddit and Warren Buffett for Dave Portnoy .\nOn Reddit , many traders are gathering on the subreddit r/WallStreetBets , a coarse , bro-y space that describes itself as \u201c like 4chan found a Bloomberg Terminal \u201d and is now 1.3 million members \u2014 or , in its terms , \u201c degenerates \u201d \u2014 strong . ( For comparison , the r/investing subreddit has 1.1 million members . ) The subreddit is , as is par for the course on Reddit , quite ugly and excessive \u2014 users refer to themselves as \u201c autists , \u201d talk about \u201c YOLO-ing \u201d their money away , and post screenshots of their brokerage accounts showing massive losses or gains . But it \u2019 s also influential : As Luke Kawa wrote for Bloomberg in February , some stocks skyrocketed after being mentioned there , and there \u2019 s broadly an attitude that traders can try to make stocks move there through the force of sheer collective will .\nAt the very least , it \u2019 s a place people are hanging out and looking for ideas . And they sometimes make decisions based on little information beyond seeing a stock ticker float by or seeing a recommendation or news flash from an anonymous person online .\n\u201c Strategy ? I wouldn \u2019 t use that word to describe it , \u201d Nick Thoendel , a project manager in commercial doors and hardware in Alabama , told me when I asked him about his strategy for investing the $ 1,000 he \u2019 s got in Robinhood . \u201c Just really whatever everyone \u2019 s talking about . \u201d\nTom Pariso , 40 , who lives in Los Angeles , has been trading through Robinhood for a couple of years , putting in about $ 15,000 in total , and got more enthralled thanks to the r/WallStreetBets community . \u201c They \u2019 re complete strangers , but you feel like they know what they \u2019 re talking about , \u201d he said . He had what he described as a \u201c crazy couple of weeks where everything was clicking \u201d earlier this year , and in March , he took to the forum to brag about his gains of more than $ 100,000 . \u201c Then all of a sudden , everything turned in the other direction , \u201d he told me .\nPariso is now back to more or less where he started , but he can \u2019 t quit altogether . \u201c I don \u2019 t know why . The app is so easy , and the interface , it feels like a game , \u201d he said of Robinhood . He \u2019 s also still on the subreddit and feels like the conversation is getting darker there , with more users making coded references to suicide . Much of the time , he says , it \u2019 s joking , but he has started to report people to Reddit about the potential for self-harm . \u201c There are people telling stories about how they cashed out of their 401 ( k ) at the start of the pandemic and took their money that they had , got in at the wrong time , and lost everything , \u201d he said .\nWhile the force of r/WallStreetBets is a collective one , Dave Portnoy , the founder of the blog Barstool Sports , is putting on a one-man show of sorts around the stock market . Portnoy , 43 , started day trading earlier this year . He livestreams himself daily trading as \u201c Davey Day Trader Global , \u201d or # DDGT , and claims to be the captain of the stock market . His antics can be pretty ridiculous \u2014 in June , he accidentally bopped himself on the head with a hammer anticipating market close \u2014 but he \u2019 s super entertaining . While he \u2019 s acknowledged major losses , his focus is on gains and the mantra that \u201c stocks only go up. \u201d The basic belief is that , eventually , prices will improve .\nIt \u2019 s not clear how many people follow Portnoy \u2019 s investment advice to a T \u2014 on July 1 , he tweeted that Sonos should go bankrupt and it ended the day in the green . But he has caused a bit of a ruction on Wall Street . He is part of the conversation among some bigger names in investing and has been outspoken in criticizing certain figures . He declared billionaire investor Warren Buffett \u201c washed up \u201d and delivered a lengthy attack on Oaktree Capital and Howard Marks , decrying the firm as a \u201c corporate raider \u201d that engaged in \u201c scumbag practices \u201d in the wake of the Great Recession .\nTyler Grant , a lawyer in New York , followed Portnoy into Spirit Airlines and made money off the trade , though on other trades , he \u2019 s bet against him . \u201c His legacy is going to be the fact that he got people who realized they can get in the game and get in the game really cheaply , \u201d he said .\nI brought the green hammer of death out and concussed myself in the process . If that \u2019 s what it takes to make # DDTG clients money I \u2019 ll do it . pic.twitter.com/lEuUmzob5D \u2014 Dave Portnoy ( @ stoolpresidente ) June 30 , 2020\nPart of Portnoy \u2019 s shtick is that he claims to have no idea what he \u2019 s doing so he can \u2019 t be held responsible for where he invests or whether people follow him . One day in June , he talked about NSPR , the stock ticker for InspireMD , making him money because a woman he went on a date with told him about it and he invested $ 400,000 to impress her . Another day , he picked tiles out of a Scrabble bag to find stocks to invest in . Grant said he doesn \u2019 t believe it \u2019 s as random as it seems \u2014 after all , he picked Raytheon , a nearly $ 100 billion defense contractor . \u201c It wasn \u2019 t like Dave Portnoy went into a bag and pulled out a penny stock , \u201d he said .\nThoendel , from Alabama , tried to follow Portnoy into airlines for a bit , but it didn \u2019 t work out . He has a full-time job and can \u2019 t watch the livestreams anyway , though he still keeps up where he can . \u201c His whole claiming he \u2019 s better than Warren Buffett and stuff is hilarious , \u201d he said . \u201c He \u2019 s just a shock jock , basically . \u201d\nWhile there is likely some overlap between the r/WallStreetBets crowd and Portnoy , it \u2019 s not clear how much . Portnoy appears to steer clear of options , while on Reddit , they \u2019 re an important focus . Another curious facet : When you try to post about Barstool Sports and Portnoy on the subreddit , you get an automatic response from a moderator : \u201c Do not post about barstoolsports or David Portnoy here please . Doing so will mean a ban of arbitrary length . \u201d\nPortnoy and Barstool Sports did not respond to a request for comment for this story . The moderators of r/WallStreetBets \u2019 initial response was \u201c ( \u3063\u25d4\u25e1\u25d4 ) \u3063 \u2665 tits or gtfo \u2665 . \u201d\nWhen I pressed about Portnoy , I got a longer answer : \u201c Well , first : WSB is not a part of any trend \u2014 we are the trendsetters , the makers of music , the dreamers of dreams , if you will . Second : Day trading is but a part of what we do here . Mostly it is memes and calling each other lovingly derogatory names . \u201d\nThe \u201c stocks only go up \u201d meme is correct in the sense that according to conventional wisdom , the stock market , overall , eventually does go up . That \u2019 s why when the market crashes , experts say not to sell and instead to wait it out . The problem is , when it comes to individual stocks or trading mechanisms that are more complex , it \u2019 s entirely possible to get wiped out .\nThat \u2019 s what happened to Jordan , a consultant in his 40s who asked to remain anonymous to protect his privacy . He had been trading for a while on Robinhood , but in March , the coronavirus lockdowns hit and he started trading more , including leveraged exchange-traded funds , or ETFs . Basically , when the underlying index or fund goes up or down , instead of following it at a one-to-one ratio , leveraged ETFs follow at a two-to-one or three-to-one pace . In Jordan \u2019 s case , he was focused on oil .\nAt one point , he was up 400 percent , but now , he \u2019 s given back those gains . \u201c To be honest , I had no idea what I was doing , \u201d he said . \u201c I have nowhere near the fiscal acuity to understand how those trades work . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s part of the problem with investing in general : It \u2019 s really hard to get it right , even for professionals .\nSpencer Miller , who runs a Robinhood Stock Traders group on Facebook with his brother , rarely uses Robinhood because he knows it can compel you into taking on too much risk . ( He named the Facebook group that because he knew it would get more members . ) But he sees stocks trend in the group \u2014 Hertz , Genius Brands , Luckin \u2019 Coffee \u2014 and then fade . He also sees people learning some hard lessons , gaining a bunch of money and then losing it fast . \u201c Robinhood at times can feel like free money , especially if you get a few winners right off the bat , \u201d he said . \u201c You just see the same story over and over and over again . \u201d\nThe hope with most of these traders is that they \u2019 re not making bets they can \u2019 t afford to lose . But inevitably , when people piled into bankrupt Hertz in June , someone was left holding the bag and paid $ 5.00 for a stock now worth $ 1.50 .\nIn June , 20-year-old student Alex Kearns from Illinois died by suicide after thinking he \u2019 d lost $ 730,000 on an options trade on Robinhood . In a note to his family , he said he had \u201c no clue \u201d what he was doing . Robinhood subsequently said it would make adjustments to its platform to put in place more guardrails around options trading . It \u2019 s still scary : As the Financial Times notes , when he died , Kearns actually had a $ 16,000 balance in his account , not a $ 700,000 debt .\nMiller recalled a similar mix-up once happening with him , where it appeared he \u2019 d lost $ 200,000 on the Robinhood app and then adjusted . \u201c It \u2019 s the way Robinhood is set up , where everything flows nicely until the moment when it doesn \u2019 t seem to . \u201d\nAnd the app itself , like any tech platform , is prone to glitches . Robinhood experienced widespread outages in early March when markets were going wild , locking many traders out of making any changes to their portfolios . Herman Singh , 22 , estimates he lost $ 3,000 during the shutdowns , and the company offered to pay him back $ 75 . \u201c For small traders , that \u2019 s a big amount , \u201d he said . He \u2019 s still trading , but he \u2019 s now using other apps .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not just about investing in the market , but what is your wealth confidence overall ? Do you have money in retirement ? Do you have an emergency fund ? Do you have savings ? Credit card debt ? Student loan debt ? If you have any of the above , conversations about the stock market shouldn \u2019 t be coming out of your mouth , \u201d said Lauren Simmons , a former stock trader at the New York Stock Exchange , cautioning about the risk of people getting into the market . \u201c We are reaching historic highs again , and we are in a global pandemic . \u201d\nThe stock market bottomed out in late March and has generally rallied since . Retail investors aren \u2019 t really the cause \u2014 much of the recovery is attributable to the Federal Reserve \u2014 but they \u2019 re making a difference in certain arenas .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think we can blame retail traders for jacking up the market , but at an individual stock level , it \u2019 s a little bit different , \u201d said Nick Colas , co-founder of the market insight firm Datatrek Research .\nSmall investors bought up shares of bankrupt companies like Hertz and JC Penney , temporarily driving up their prices , this spring . If you look at Robin Track , which follows the most popular names on the platform , most of them are recognizable and ones where major institutions are heavily invested to the point that traders with a few thousand dollars in their accounts aren \u2019 t going to do much \u2014 Ford , American Airlines , Disney . They are also generally fairly safe . But then there are more surprising and lesser-known ones , such as Aurora Cannabis .\nAs the Wall Street Journal reported , Options Clearing Corp. has seen a 45 percent jump in daily options contract trading averages this year compared to last , and Goldman Sachs found that options volume from single-contract trades of the 50 top-traded stocks is up from 10 percent to 14 percent . Goldman also estimates that the proportion of shares volume from small trades has gone from 3 percent to 7 percent in recent months .\n\u201c If nothing else , I think everybody agrees that retail trading today is orders of measure bigger than it was a year ago , \u201d Bianco said .\nTo be sure , people basically gambling with money they would be devastated to lose is bad . On the other hand , it \u2019 s not clear that \u2019 s what \u2019 s happening en masse . And the traders , well , they \u2019 ve got a point : It \u2019 s not like billionaire investors are the good guys here , and why should they be locked out of the opportunities rich people are privy to ?\n\u201c Do you have money in retirement ? Do you have an emergency fund ? Do you have savings ? Credit card debt ? Student loan debt ? If you have any of the above , conversations about the stock market shouldn \u2019 t be coming out of your mouth . \u201d\nYes , most speculators and day traders lose money . But the pros don \u2019 t do infinitely better : Hedge funds and professional stock pickers consistently underperform the S & P 500 . It \u2019 s easy to chafe at Portnoy \u2019 s attitude and approach \u2014 not to mention issues of toxicity in Barstool \u2019 s culture \u2014 and at r/WSB \u2019 s tone . But what about private equity firms that buy up companies , fleece them , and then sell them off for parts ? Or hedge funds that scooped up troubled assets during the financial crisis to make billions ? Or the market-makers like Citadel Securities that are ultimately the ones making money off Robinhood \u2019 s trades ? Or the money Robinhood itself is making pushing customers in a dangerous direction ?\n\u201c I think Portnoy drives Wall Street crazy because he \u2019 s exposing some of the fallacies that you see on Wall Street , \u201d said Bianco , who acknowledges he \u2019 s a \u201c suit \u201d in Portnoy \u2019 s world . \u201c He \u2019 s making a mockery out of stock-picking because we all know on Wall Street the vast majority of stock pickers that run portfolios can not beat the indexes . \u201d\nPortnoy is a multimillionaire , and he appears to be using a small portion of his total net worth to trade . He \u2019 s said once sports betting returns , he \u2019 ll go back to that , plus there \u2019 s no denying this is quite a marketing opportunity for him and for Barstool .\nAnd the opportunity to invest in the stock market , even through commission-free platforms , isn \u2019 t available to everyone . You have to have some money to invest \u2014 Colas estimates the average account size is somewhere between $ 2,000 and $ 5,000 \u2014 and not everyone does . What \u2019 s more , it appears the majority of the people investing are men .\nStill , the army of retail traders is reading the room . The stock market does , generally , recover , and the March collapse was an opportunity . There \u2019 s not a really lucrative alternative to stocks for generating returns , and the federal government and Federal Reserve have demonstrated they \u2019 re more than willing to take extraordinary actions to prop up the market and big industries . The government didn \u2019 t let the banks fail last time around , so it \u2019 s hard to believe they \u2019 ll let the airlines fail now \u2014 so why not invest ?\n\u201c Really , we all kind of know they \u2019 re all going to come back , \u201d Grant , the New York lawyer , said . \u201c It would take a huge market collapse for there not to be a Delta . \u201d\nOf course , it \u2019 s possible the stock market will crash again or that we \u2019 ll see another correction . There is a fine line between giving people the ability to try to access opportunities to gain wealth and exposing them to predatory practices and unfair risk , like what Robinhood , seemingly pushing people toward options , is doing .\nThis flurry of retail traders has happened before . Before there was Dave Portnoy , there was Stuart , the fictional Ameritrade trader leading the way on the dot-com boom . Back then , everyone was into internet 1.0 , Colas noted ; now they \u2019 re just generally optimistic . \u201c There is no unifying theme this time around , \u201d he said . \u201c There isn \u2019 t a theme that shovels billions of dollars into a raft of dumb ideas that have a common theme . \u201d\nPlus , it \u2019 s getting a new generation of people into investing , which Wall Street types should be fine with . Maybe they are .\nUltimately , the broader trading trend also says something about the economy . While for many people their new stock market habit is a game , it \u2019 s also one that \u2019 s accompanied by real goals \u2014 to pay off student loans , to start a business , to have a nest egg set aside for 20 years from now . Some people I spoke with even expressed guilt . Liam Walker , a data protection officer in the UK , said he considered investing in pharmaceutical stocks but decided against it . \u201c Ethically , it \u2019 s strange to try to gain some sort of advantage out of the current situation that the world is in , \u201d he said .\nAlfredo Gil , 30 , a New York writer and producer , expressed a similar sentiment of internal conflict with regard to his trading habits . Gil is trying to write a graphic novel and launch his own production company , and he hopes maybe the stock market is the way to save up enough money to do it . He \u2019 s investing in fairly safe vehicles \u2014 ETFs and companies like Disney and Tesla \u2014 and , depending on the given week , is up between $ 13,000 and $ 20,000 . He admits that he checks his Robinhood account \u201c often enough for it to be unhealthy . \u201d\nHe worries about contributing to corporate greed and the corrupting powers of wealth , and most of his social circle know he \u2019 s investing . \u201c I \u2019 m attending protests , and I \u2019 m very vocal with my friends about the current movement and defunding the police . To say , \u2018 Oh , I \u2019 m making a lot of money , \u2019 it \u2019 s just not a cool thing to say or bring up . \u201d\nBut Gil also sees that this is the system he lives in .

    "content_original": "Jennifer Chang got into investing in 2019, but it was only during the pandemic that she started dealing in options trading, where the risk is higher, but so is the reward.\n\n\u201cWith options, you can make money so much faster. So I was then having days where I would make $1,000 a day, and then I made $10,000 in a day,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then I started getting really cocky, and I didn\u2019t even think I could even lose so much money. Then during the day when it was like we had a really big drop, I lost everything I had made.\u201d\n\nChang, 39, lost her job at a nonprofit in the financial downturn, fell down a \u201crabbit hole of stock videos\u201d on YouTube, and by now has put about $25,000 into the trading app Robinhood. The day we spoke, she was basically back where she started. \u201cI take it in stride, because it\u2019s money I had made, but it wasn\u2019t really there.\u201d\n\nShe is not an anomaly. In recent months, the stock market has seen a boom in retail trading. Online brokerages have reported a record number of new accounts and a big uptick in trading activity. People are bored at home, sports betting and casinos are largely off the table, and many look at that $1,200 stimulus check they got earlier this year as free money. Some are taking cues from mainstream sources like the Wall Street Journal and CNBC, others are looking at Reddit and Barstool Sports\u2019 Dave Portnoy for ideas (and entertainment). And commission-free trading on gamified apps makes investing easy and appealing, even addicting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of scary, because I am unemployed right now, I don\u2019t want to put too much at risk. But I think I have enough in savings that I\u2019m willing to take that risk a little bit, because I also really like gambling,\u201d Chang said. She\u2019s not sure what all of this will mean for her taxes.\n\nI spoke with more than a dozen traders about where they\u2019re putting their money, why, and how it\u2019s going. Some are doing well, while others have learned some hard lessons already, and they\u2019re aware things can get out of control \u2014 most of the people I talked to referenced a 20-year-old Robinhood trader who died by suicide in June after believing he\u2019d lost hundreds of thousands of dollars on the app. Still, for a lot of them, it\u2019s largely a game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s boring watching stocks, it\u2019s not exciting, they\u2019re not making these crazy prices,\u201d said Adam Barker, a 31-year-old software engineer in Massachusetts. \u201cYou don\u2019t get a rush throwing money at Berkshire Hathaway and waiting 15 years.\u201d\n\nWhatever the strategy of this new crop of traders \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 they have Wall Street\u2019s attention. They remain a small portion of the market, but there is evidence they\u2019re making a difference along the margins. They\u2019ve ignored predictions from high-profile investors that another crash is on the horizon, and thus far, they\u2019ve been right. Many of them relish in their battle against the \u201csuits\u201d to prove that anyone can play in stocks.\n\nThere\u2019s been plenty of finger-wagging in their direction: Billionaire investor Leon Cooperman in June said they\u2019re just doing \u201cstupid things\u201d and that the momentum will \u201cend in tears.\u201d Oaktree Capital co-founder Howard Marks warned it\u2019s \u201cnot healthy to have people buying stocks for fun.\u201d\n\nWhile there\u2019s certainly cause for concern some might be in over their heads, it\u2019s also hard to argue that financial opportunity should be cordoned off for institutions and the rich, especially in an economy plagued by inequality where financial mobility, for many, is a myth.\n\nThe trading game\n\nTraditionally, stock-trading has come with a fee, meaning if you wanted to buy or sell, you had to pay for each transaction. But companies like Robinhood have taken a jackhammer to that system by offering commission-free trading. Other major online brokers \u2014 Charles Schwab, E-Trade, and TD Ameritrade \u2014 have followed suit. Many brokerages are also letting people buy fractional shares, so if you don\u2019t have the $3,000 to invest in Amazon stock, you can put in $300 to buy one-tenth of it.\n\nTrading isn\u2019t really free, and big market-makers like Citadel Securities and Virtu Financial pay millions of dollars to process the trades and put them back onto the market, making money off of the spread \u2014 the price difference between the buy and the sell. Nathaniel Popper at the New York Times recently outlined how Robinhood makes money off of its customers, and more than other brokerages.\n\n\u201cIt gives the appearance that you\u2019re not paying a commission, but it\u2019s just hidden,\u201d said Jim Bianco, president and macro strategist at Bianco Research.\n\nBut the perception that it\u2019s frictionless and free has helped boost retail trading, and during the pandemic, people have flocked to trading platforms to try their hand at the market. Robinhood, in particular, has become representative of the retail trading boom. The platform, founded by Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt in 2013 and launched in 2015, says it has about 10 million approved customer accounts, many of whom are new to the market. Its mission is to \u201cdemocratize finance for all,\u201d according to its website. \u201cWe fundamentally believe participation is power, and that the stock market can be an important wealth creation engine,\u201d a spokesperson for Robinhood said.\n\nRobinhood\u2019s version of financial democratization feels deliberately like a game. When you sign up, it offers you a free stock, generally under $10, and encourages you to invite your friends to get more free stocks. The screen turns green when you\u2019re up and red when you\u2019re down, and when you trade, it sometimes sends you confetti and gives you the money instantly so you can trade again. It\u2019s easy to see how people get sucked in fast.\n\n\u201cRobinhood feels very gamified. The act of trading stocks was boring for a really long time, and even today, if you do it through Charles Schwab, it would seem boring. Robinhood makes it feel frictionless and fun and easy, and it can be very, very addicting,\u201d said Noah Whinston, who founded an eSports franchise. He does some trading for fun on Robinhood but does most of his investments through a financial adviser. \u201cI\u2019m well aware if I put a lot of money into Robinhood, I might allocate that in ways that are not the smartest but instead based on short-term serotonin hits.\u201d\n\nSome people are able to resist the temptation, like Nate Brown, 23. He got his first job out of college working in government tech and decided to try out investing. \u201cI buy stocks once a month, so probably not as often as you\u2019d expect just because I\u2019m trying to follow that longer trend,\u201d he said. \u201cI saw the options thing on the app, but it honestly kind of scares me.\u201d\n\nBut Brown seems more like the exception in this current cohort of day traders, not the rule. What they\u2019re doing isn\u2019t really investing, it\u2019s gambling.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same exact rush you get sitting down at a blackjack table,\u201d said Luke Lloyd, a wealth adviser at Strategic Wealth Partners. He says he worries about a new generation of traders getting addicted to the excitement. \u201cIt\u2019s like putting all of your money on one number at the roulette table.\u201d\n\nSome traders have become especially enticed by more complex maneuvers and vehicles. A big draw appears to be options trading, which gives traders the right to buy or sell shares of something in a certain period. People can use options to hedge their portfolios, but most of the traders I talked to were using them to make bets as to whether a stock would go up (a call) or go down (a put) and inject some extra adrenaline into the process.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of risk involved, and you can definitely see why people get into the gambling side of things. It\u2019s definitely the rush,\u201d Barker, the Massachusetts software engineer, said. He kicked about half of his stimulus check into Robinhood and is mainly trading options. \u201cI\u2019m not really in it for the long term.\u201d\n\nThe Robinhood spokesperson said the company believes it\u2019s \u201ctime to move away from the notion\u201d that it\u2019s gambling or gaming and disputed that the app is gamified, instead saying that what it has is \u201caccessible, modern design.\u201d The spokesperson emphasized that it doesn\u2019t display confetti for every trade and disputed that confetti is a reward, but instead is \u201ccelebrating the achievement\u201d of participating in markets. The company also said most of its customers aren\u2019t day traders and that of the customers who trade in any given month, 12 percent make an options trade on average.\n\nReddit and Dave Portnoy, the new kings of the day traders?\n\nTraditionally, investors have been told to read the Wall Street Journal and comb through corporate filings to make decisions. This new cohort of traders has other ideas \u2014 some are swapping the Financial Times for Reddit and Warren Buffett for Dave Portnoy.\n\nOn Reddit, many traders are gathering on the subreddit r/WallStreetBets, a coarse, bro-y space that describes itself as \u201clike 4chan found a Bloomberg Terminal\u201d and is now 1.3 million members \u2014 or, in its terms, \u201cdegenerates\u201d \u2014 strong. (For comparison, the r/investing subreddit has 1.1 million members.) The subreddit is, as is par for the course on Reddit, quite ugly and excessive \u2014 users refer to themselves as \u201cautists,\u201d talk about \u201cYOLO-ing\u201d their money away, and post screenshots of their brokerage accounts showing massive losses or gains. But it\u2019s also influential: As Luke Kawa wrote for Bloomberg in February, some stocks skyrocketed after being mentioned there, and there\u2019s broadly an attitude that traders can try to make stocks move there through the force of sheer collective will.\n\nAt the very least, it\u2019s a place people are hanging out and looking for ideas. And they sometimes make decisions based on little information beyond seeing a stock ticker float by or seeing a recommendation or news flash from an anonymous person online.\n\n\u201cStrategy? I wouldn\u2019t use that word to describe it,\u201d Nick Thoendel, a project manager in commercial doors and hardware in Alabama, told me when I asked him about his strategy for investing the $1,000 he\u2019s got in Robinhood. \u201cJust really whatever everyone\u2019s talking about.\u201d\n\nTom Pariso, 40, who lives in Los Angeles, has been trading through Robinhood for a couple of years, putting in about $15,000 in total, and got more enthralled thanks to the r/WallStreetBets community. \u201cThey\u2019re complete strangers, but you feel like they know what they\u2019re talking about,\u201d he said. He had what he described as a \u201ccrazy couple of weeks where everything was clicking\u201d earlier this year, and in March, he took to the forum to brag about his gains of more than $100,000. \u201cThen all of a sudden, everything turned in the other direction,\u201d he told me.\n\nPariso is now back to more or less where he started, but he can\u2019t quit altogether. \u201cI don\u2019t know why. The app is so easy, and the interface, it feels like a game,\u201d he said of Robinhood. He\u2019s also still on the subreddit and feels like the conversation is getting darker there, with more users making coded references to suicide. Much of the time, he says, it\u2019s joking, but he has started to report people to Reddit about the potential for self-harm. \u201cThere are people telling stories about how they cashed out of their 401(k) at the start of the pandemic and took their money that they had, got in at the wrong time, and lost everything,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the force of r/WallStreetBets is a collective one, Dave Portnoy, the founder of the blog Barstool Sports, is putting on a one-man show of sorts around the stock market. Portnoy, 43, started day trading earlier this year. He livestreams himself daily trading as \u201cDavey Day Trader Global,\u201d or #DDGT, and claims to be the captain of the stock market. His antics can be pretty ridiculous \u2014 in June, he accidentally bopped himself on the head with a hammer anticipating market close \u2014 but he\u2019s super entertaining. While he\u2019s acknowledged major losses, his focus is on gains and the mantra that \u201cstocks only go up.\u201d The basic belief is that, eventually, prices will improve.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how many people follow Portnoy\u2019s investment advice to a T \u2014 on July 1, he tweeted that Sonos should go bankrupt and it ended the day in the green. But he has caused a bit of a ruction on Wall Street. He is part of the conversation among some bigger names in investing and has been outspoken in criticizing certain figures. He declared billionaire investor Warren Buffett \u201cwashed up\u201d and delivered a lengthy attack on Oaktree Capital and Howard Marks, decrying the firm as a \u201ccorporate raider\u201d that engaged in \u201cscumbag practices\u201d in the wake of the Great Recession.\n\nTyler Grant, a lawyer in New York, followed Portnoy into Spirit Airlines and made money off the trade, though on other trades, he\u2019s bet against him. \u201cHis legacy is going to be the fact that he got people who realized they can get in the game and get in the game really cheaply,\u201d he said.\n\nI brought the green hammer of death out and concussed myself in the process. If that\u2019s what it takes to make #DDTG clients money I\u2019ll do it. pic.twitter.com/lEuUmzob5D \u2014 Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) June 30, 2020\n\nPart of Portnoy\u2019s shtick is that he claims to have no idea what he\u2019s doing so he can\u2019t be held responsible for where he invests or whether people follow him. One day in June, he talked about NSPR, the stock ticker for InspireMD, making him money because a woman he went on a date with told him about it and he invested $400,000 to impress her. Another day, he picked tiles out of a Scrabble bag to find stocks to invest in. Grant said he doesn\u2019t believe it\u2019s as random as it seems \u2014 after all, he picked Raytheon, a nearly $100 billion defense contractor. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like Dave Portnoy went into a bag and pulled out a penny stock,\u201d he said.\n\nThoendel, from Alabama, tried to follow Portnoy into airlines for a bit, but it didn\u2019t work out. He has a full-time job and can\u2019t watch the livestreams anyway, though he still keeps up where he can. \u201cHis whole claiming he\u2019s better than Warren Buffett and stuff is hilarious,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s just a shock jock, basically.\u201d\n\nWhile there is likely some overlap between the r/WallStreetBets crowd and Portnoy, it\u2019s not clear how much. Portnoy appears to steer clear of options, while on Reddit, they\u2019re an important focus. Another curious facet: When you try to post about Barstool Sports and Portnoy on the subreddit, you get an automatic response from a moderator: \u201cDo not post about barstoolsports or David Portnoy here please. Doing so will mean a ban of arbitrary length.\u201d\n\nPortnoy and Barstool Sports did not respond to a request for comment for this story. The moderators of r/WallStreetBets\u2019 initial response was \u201c(\u3063\u25d4\u25e1\u25d4)\u3063 \u2665 tits or gtfo \u2665.\u201d\n\nWhen I pressed about Portnoy, I got a longer answer: \u201cWell, first: WSB is not a part of any trend \u2014 we are the trendsetters, the makers of music, the dreamers of dreams, if you will. Second: Day trading is but a part of what we do here. Mostly it is memes and calling each other lovingly derogatory names.\u201d\n\nStocks only go up until they don\u2019t\n\nThe \u201cstocks only go up\u201d meme is correct in the sense that according to conventional wisdom, the stock market, overall, eventually does go up. That\u2019s why when the market crashes, experts say not to sell and instead to wait it out. The problem is, when it comes to individual stocks or trading mechanisms that are more complex, it\u2019s entirely possible to get wiped out.\n\nThat\u2019s what happened to Jordan, a consultant in his 40s who asked to remain anonymous to protect his privacy. He had been trading for a while on Robinhood, but in March, the coronavirus lockdowns hit and he started trading more, including leveraged exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. Basically, when the underlying index or fund goes up or down, instead of following it at a one-to-one ratio, leveraged ETFs follow at a two-to-one or three-to-one pace. In Jordan\u2019s case, he was focused on oil.\n\nAt one point, he was up 400 percent, but now, he\u2019s given back those gains. \u201cTo be honest, I had no idea what I was doing,\u201d he said. \u201cI have nowhere near the fiscal acuity to understand how those trades work.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s part of the problem with investing in general: It\u2019s really hard to get it right, even for professionals.\n\nSpencer Miller, who runs a Robinhood Stock Traders group on Facebook with his brother, rarely uses Robinhood because he knows it can compel you into taking on too much risk. (He named the Facebook group that because he knew it would get more members.) But he sees stocks trend in the group \u2014 Hertz, Genius Brands, Luckin\u2019 Coffee \u2014 and then fade. He also sees people learning some hard lessons, gaining a bunch of money and then losing it fast. \u201cRobinhood at times can feel like free money, especially if you get a few winners right off the bat,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just see the same story over and over and over again.\u201d\n\nThe hope with most of these traders is that they\u2019re not making bets they can\u2019t afford to lose. But inevitably, when people piled into bankrupt Hertz in June, someone was left holding the bag and paid $5.00 for a stock now worth $1.50.\n\nIn June, 20-year-old student Alex Kearns from Illinois died by suicide after thinking he\u2019d lost $730,000 on an options trade on Robinhood. In a note to his family, he said he had \u201cno clue\u201d what he was doing. Robinhood subsequently said it would make adjustments to its platform to put in place more guardrails around options trading. It\u2019s still scary: As the Financial Times notes, when he died, Kearns actually had a $16,000 balance in his account, not a $700,000 debt.\n\nMiller recalled a similar mix-up once happening with him, where it appeared he\u2019d lost $200,000 on the Robinhood app and then adjusted. \u201cIt\u2019s the way Robinhood is set up, where everything flows nicely until the moment when it doesn\u2019t seem to.\u201d\n\nAnd the app itself, like any tech platform, is prone to glitches. Robinhood experienced widespread outages in early March when markets were going wild, locking many traders out of making any changes to their portfolios. Herman Singh, 22, estimates he lost $3,000 during the shutdowns, and the company offered to pay him back $75. \u201cFor small traders, that\u2019s a big amount,\u201d he said. He\u2019s still trading, but he\u2019s now using other apps.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about investing in the market, but what is your wealth confidence overall? Do you have money in retirement? Do you have an emergency fund? Do you have savings? Credit card debt? Student loan debt? If you have any of the above, conversations about the stock market shouldn\u2019t be coming out of your mouth,\u201d said Lauren Simmons, a former stock trader at the New York Stock Exchange, cautioning about the risk of people getting into the market. \u201cWe are reaching historic highs again, and we are in a global pandemic.\u201d\n\nWho has the right to move markets\n\nThe stock market bottomed out in late March and has generally rallied since. Retail investors aren\u2019t really the cause \u2014 much of the recovery is attributable to the Federal Reserve \u2014 but they\u2019re making a difference in certain arenas.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we can blame retail traders for jacking up the market, but at an individual stock level, it\u2019s a little bit different,\u201d said Nick Colas, co-founder of the market insight firm Datatrek Research.\n\nSmall investors bought up shares of bankrupt companies like Hertz and JC Penney, temporarily driving up their prices, this spring. If you look at Robin Track, which follows the most popular names on the platform, most of them are recognizable and ones where major institutions are heavily invested to the point that traders with a few thousand dollars in their accounts aren\u2019t going to do much \u2014 Ford, American Airlines, Disney. They are also generally fairly safe. But then there are more surprising and lesser-known ones, such as Aurora Cannabis.\n\nAs the Wall Street Journal reported, Options Clearing Corp. has seen a 45 percent jump in daily options contract trading averages this year compared to last, and Goldman Sachs found that options volume from single-contract trades of the 50 top-traded stocks is up from 10 percent to 14 percent. Goldman also estimates that the proportion of shares volume from small trades has gone from 3 percent to 7 percent in recent months.\n\n\u201cIf nothing else, I think everybody agrees that retail trading today is orders of measure bigger than it was a year ago,\u201d Bianco said.\n\nTo be sure, people basically gambling with money they would be devastated to lose is bad. On the other hand, it\u2019s not clear that\u2019s what\u2019s happening en masse. And the traders, well, they\u2019ve got a point: It\u2019s not like billionaire investors are the good guys here, and why should they be locked out of the opportunities rich people are privy to?\n\n\u201cDo you have money in retirement? Do you have an emergency fund? Do you have savings? Credit card debt? Student loan debt? If you have any of the above, conversations about the stock market shouldn\u2019t be coming out of your mouth.\u201d\n\nYes, most speculators and day traders lose money. But the pros don\u2019t do infinitely better: Hedge funds and professional stock pickers consistently underperform the S&P 500. It\u2019s easy to chafe at Portnoy\u2019s attitude and approach \u2014 not to mention issues of toxicity in Barstool\u2019s culture \u2014 and at r/WSB\u2019s tone. But what about private equity firms that buy up companies, fleece them, and then sell them off for parts? Or hedge funds that scooped up troubled assets during the financial crisis to make billions? Or the market-makers like Citadel Securities that are ultimately the ones making money off Robinhood\u2019s trades? Or the money Robinhood itself is making pushing customers in a dangerous direction?\n\n\u201cI think Portnoy drives Wall Street crazy because he\u2019s exposing some of the fallacies that you see on Wall Street,\u201d said Bianco, who acknowledges he\u2019s a \u201csuit\u201d in Portnoy\u2019s world. \u201cHe\u2019s making a mockery out of stock-picking because we all know on Wall Street the vast majority of stock pickers that run portfolios cannot beat the indexes.\u201d\n\nPortnoy is a multimillionaire, and he appears to be using a small portion of his total net worth to trade. He\u2019s said once sports betting returns, he\u2019ll go back to that, plus there\u2019s no denying this is quite a marketing opportunity for him and for Barstool.\n\nAnd the opportunity to invest in the stock market, even through commission-free platforms, isn\u2019t available to everyone. You have to have some money to invest \u2014 Colas estimates the average account size is somewhere between $2,000 and $5,000 \u2014 and not everyone does. What\u2019s more, it appears the majority of the people investing are men.\n\nStill, the army of retail traders is reading the room. The stock market does, generally, recover, and the March collapse was an opportunity. There\u2019s not a really lucrative alternative to stocks for generating returns, and the federal government and Federal Reserve have demonstrated they\u2019re more than willing to take extraordinary actions to prop up the market and big industries. The government didn\u2019t let the banks fail last time around, so it\u2019s hard to believe they\u2019ll let the airlines fail now \u2014 so why not invest?\n\n\u201cReally, we all kind of know they\u2019re all going to come back,\u201d Grant, the New York lawyer, said. \u201cIt would take a huge market collapse for there not to be a Delta.\u201d\n\nOf course, it\u2019s possible the stock market will crash again or that we\u2019ll see another correction. There is a fine line between giving people the ability to try to access opportunities to gain wealth and exposing them to predatory practices and unfair risk, like what Robinhood, seemingly pushing people toward options, is doing.\n\nThis flurry of retail traders has happened before. Before there was Dave Portnoy, there was Stuart, the fictional Ameritrade trader leading the way on the dot-com boom. Back then, everyone was into internet 1.0, Colas noted; now they\u2019re just generally optimistic. \u201cThere is no unifying theme this time around,\u201d he said. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a theme that shovels billions of dollars into a raft of dumb ideas that have a common theme.\u201d\n\nPlus, it\u2019s getting a new generation of people into investing, which Wall Street types should be fine with. Maybe they are.\n\nUltimately, the broader trading trend also says something about the economy. While for many people their new stock market habit is a game, it\u2019s also one that\u2019s accompanied by real goals \u2014 to pay off student loans, to start a business, to have a nest egg set aside for 20 years from now. Some people I spoke with even expressed guilt. Liam Walker, a data protection officer in the UK, said he considered investing in pharmaceutical stocks but decided against it. \u201cEthically, it\u2019s strange to try to gain some sort of advantage out of the current situation that the world is in,\u201d he said.\n\nAlfredo Gil, 30, a New York writer and producer, expressed a similar sentiment of internal conflict with regard to his trading habits. Gil is trying to write a graphic novel and launch his own production company, and he hopes maybe the stock market is the way to save up enough money to do it. He\u2019s investing in fairly safe vehicles \u2014 ETFs and companies like Disney and Tesla \u2014 and, depending on the given week, is up between $13,000 and $20,000. He admits that he checks his Robinhood account \u201coften enough for it to be unhealthy.\u201d\n\nHe worries about contributing to corporate greed and the corrupting powers of wealth, and most of his social circle know he\u2019s investing. \u201cI\u2019m attending protests, and I\u2019m very vocal with my friends about the current movement and defunding the police. To say, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m making a lot of money,\u2019 it\u2019s just not a cool thing to say or bring up.\u201d\n\nBut Gil also sees that this is the system he lives in. Maybe if the United States had Medicare-for-all or universal basic income, he says, he wouldn\u2019t be compelled to play the stock market, and things would be different. But they aren\u2019t. \u201cThere is a strain of guilt I have regarding making money during this crisis that is increasing our inequality,\u201d he said, \u201cbut as a gay person of color with no intergenerational wealth, I think there can be things to learn on how to navigate our world.\u201d\n\nSupport Vox\u2019s explanatory journalism\n\nEvery day at Vox, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.
