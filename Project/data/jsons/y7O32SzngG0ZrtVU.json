''\nAnother source close to Romney puts it this way : `` I would n't bet on it , but I would n't bet either . ''\nThe key , these sources say , is that Romney wants to see a Republican candidate who can win the White House . So there 's a willingness to wait to see who will run for the GOP nomination . While these sources say that , as of today , it 's not likely Romney would run , it ca n't be ruled out entirely -- and if the early seeding were to produce a weak field , Romney might be in a position to be a late entrant .\nBut as one ally points out , this is all `` in the realm of the truly hypothetical , '' and still remains `` very unlikely . ''\nEven so , Romney allies are now indulging in the hypothetical .\n`` If Romney were to run , '' one source says , `` he would be the last guy in the race .

He says if Jeb Bush were to decline a run , that would probably increase Romney 's chances of running `` by about 20 percent , '' but he still says it 's a longshot\nOne big question is Romney 's wife , Ann , who will be the key to any decision . She said `` never again '' after the last run . `` I am over it , '' she told CNN in June 2013 . `` It 's still hard to watch things and watch the news and feel like you wish you were there , but you move on .

It 's time for someone else to get in there and give it their best shot . ''\nAlthough , in that same interview , Romney spoke of the experience of running as a `` thrill . ''\n`` And frankly I 'd do it again , but -- but it 's not my time , '' he said then .\nSince ending his 2012 campaign , Romney has mostly stayed out of the limelight . He has hosted an annual conference of policy and political leaders and donors in Park City , Utah , to discuss some of the nation 's problems and talk about solutions .\nThis year , he has appeared at a number of fund-raisers and public events for candidates , proving to be one of the Republican Party 's most popular surrogates -- and fiercest critics of President Barack Obama 's foreign and defense policies . He wrote a Washington Post op-ed earlier this month arguing against defense budget cuts , saying policy makers `` ... will choose whether to succumb to the easy path of continued military hollowing or to honor their constitutional pledge to protect the United States .
