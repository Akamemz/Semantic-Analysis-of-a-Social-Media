We said in this space months ago that Trump should have disclosed his tax returns and moved that issue off the table to prevent just that possibility , and if there are multiple leaks showing dishonesty or illegality in his taxes , Trump \u2019 s campaign could be dead \u2014 and rightly , if unnecessarily .\nBut for the purposes of this column we will assume that what the Democrats , the Clinton campaign , and the New York Times , among which there are only imperceptible differences , have on Trump \u2019 s taxes they have already delivered to the public eye . And if that is true , Trump absolutely should have disclosed his returns .\nAt least not politically . No business leader likes to admit of a major financial reversal ; to a real estate magnate , for example , the evidence of a deal gone bad or a deep pool of red ink can be a major disgrace and the loss of much of a hard-won reputation as a winner . In Trump \u2019 s case that would seem to be doubly true ; his entire brand is based on selling himself as smarter , tougher , harder-working and shrewder than the competition , and the knowledge that 21 years ago he took almost a billion-dollar bath can \u2019 t be a pleasant memory .\nA number of things are true here . The first is that Trump made a lousy bet on owning so much of the Atlantic City gaming and tourism market ; there isn \u2019 t anything magical about a second-rate burg on the Jersey Shore , and once casino gambling became legal in places all around the country there was nothing in particular that would draw tourists to Atlantic City rather than the Mississippi Gulf Coast , for example . Trump \u2019 s losses in 1995 , which came from the bankruptcy of the casinos he owned in Atlantic City , were a perfect reflection of what the competition of legalized gambling mushrooming all over the country in the early 1990s did to that market .

This flies in the face of fundamental principles of economics , as our readers know \u2014 if you don \u2019 t allow an investor to carry forward a loss he incurred on a bad investment , he will cut down on those investments he does make and the economy won \u2019 t benefit from the circulation of his money .\nIn fact , a net operating loss is very common in businesses .
