    "content": "The soi-disant Land of the Free and Home of the Brave has a long and iniquitous history of overthrowing democratically elected leftist governments and propping up right-wing dictators in their place .\nU.S. politicians rarely acknowledge this odious past -- let alone acknowledge that such policies continue well into the present day .\nIn the second Democratic presidential debate , however , candidate Bernie Sanders condemned a long-standing government policy his peers rarely admit exists .\n`` I think we have a disagreement , '' Sanders said of fellow presidential candidate Hillary Clinton . `` And the disagreement is that not only did I vote against the war in Iraq . If you look at history , you will find that regime change -- whether it was in the early '50s in Iran , whether it was toppling Salvador Allende in Chile , or whether it was overthrowing the government of Guatemala way back when -- these invasions , these toppling of governments , regime changes have unintended consequences . I would say that on this issue I 'm a little bit more conservative than the secretary . ''\n`` I am not a great fan of regime changes , '' Sanders added .\n`` Regime change '' is not a phrase you hear discussed honestly much in Washington , yet it is a common practice in and defining feature of U.S. foreign policy for well over a century . For many decades , leaders from both sides of the aisle , Republicans and Democrats , have pursued a bipartisan strategy of violently overthrowing democratically elected foreign governments that do not kowtow to U.S. orders .\nIn the debate , Sanders addressed three examples of U.S. regime change . There are scores of examples of American regime change , yet these are perhaps the most infamous instances .\nIran was once a secular democracy . You would not know this from contemporary discussions of the much demonized country in U.S. politics and media .\nWhat happened to Iran 's democracy ? The U.S. overthrew it in 1953 , with the help of the U.K. Why ? For oil .\nMohammad Mosaddegh may be the most popular leader in Iran 's long history . He was also Iran 's only democratically elected head of state .\nIn 1951 , Mosaddegh was elected prime minister of Iran . He was not a socialist , and certainly not a communist -- on the contrary , he repressed Iranian communists -- but he pursued many progressive , social democratic policies . Mosaddegh pushed for land reform , established rent control , and created a social security system , while working to separate powers in the democratic government .\nIn the Cold War , however , a leader who deviated in any way from free-market orthodoxy and the Washington Consensus was deemed a threat . When Mossaddegh nationalized Iran 's large oil reserves , he crossed a line that Western capitalist nations would not tolerate .\nThe New York Times ran an article in 1951 titled `` British Warn Iran of Serious Result if She Seizes Oil . '' The piece , which is full of orientalist language , refers to Iranian oil as `` British oil properties , '' failing to acknowledge that Britain , which had previously occupied Iran , had seized that oil and claimed it as its own , administering it under the auspices of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company , which later became the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company , and eventually British Petroleum and modern BP .\nThe Times article noted that the U.S. `` shares with Britain the gravest concern about the possibility that Iranian oil , the biggest supply now available in the Near East , might be lost to the Western powers . '' The British government is quoted making a thinly veiled threat .\nThis threat came into fruition in August 1953 . In Operation Ajax , the CIA , working with its British equivalent MI6 , carried out a coup , overthrowing the elected government of Iran and reinstalling the monarchy . The shah would remain a faithful Western ally until 1979 , when the monarchy was abolished in the Iranian Revolution .\nLess than a year after overthrowing Iran 's first democratically elected prime minister , the U.S. pursued a similar regime change policy in Guatemala , toppling the elected leader Jacobo \u00c1rbenz .\nIn 1944 , Guatemalans waged a revolution , toppling the U.S.-backed right-wing dictator Jorge Ubico , who had ruled the country with an iron fist since 1931 . Ubico , who fancied himself the 20th-century Napoleon , gave rich landowners and the U.S. corporation the United Fruit Company ( which would later become Chiquita ) free reign over Guatemala 's natural resources , and used the military to violently crush labor organizers .\nJuan Jos\u00e9 Ar\u00e9valo was elected into office in 1944 . A liberal , he pursued very moderate policies , but the U.S. wanted a right-wing puppet regime that would allow U.S. corporations the same privileges granted to them by Ubico . In 1949 , the U.S. backed an attempted coup , yet it failed .\nIn 1951 , \u00c1rbenz was elected into office . Slightly to the left of Ar\u00e9valo , \u00c1rbenz was still decidedly moderate . The U.S. claimed \u00c1rbenz was close to Guatemala 's communists , and warned he could ally with the Soviet Union . In reality , the opposite was true ; \u00c1rbenz actually persecuted Guatemalan communists . At most , \u00c1rbenz was a social democrat , not even a socialist .\nYet \u00c1rbenz , like Mosaddegh , firmly believed that Guatemalans themselves , and not multinational corporations , should benefit from their country 's resources . He pursued land reform policies that would break up the control rich families and the United Fruit Company exercised over the country -- and , for that reason , he was overthrown .\nPresident Truman originally authorized a first coup attempt , Operation PBFORTUNE , in 1952 . Yet details about the operation were leaked to the public , and the plan was abandoned . In 1954 , in Operation PBSUCCESS , the CIA and U.S. State Department , under the Dulles Brothers , bombed Guatemala City and carried out a coup that violently toppled Guatemala 's democratic government .\nThe U.S. put into power right-wing tyrant Carlos Castillo Armas . For the next more than 50 years , until the end of the Guatemalan Civil War in 1996 , Guatemala was ruled by a serious of authoritarian right-wing leaders who brutally repressed left-wing dissidents and carried out a campaign of genocide against the indigenous people of the country .\nSeptember 11 has permanently seared itself into the memory of Americans . The date has also been indelibly imprinted in the public consciousness of Chileans , because it was on this same day in 1973 that the U.S. backed a coup that violently overthrew Chile 's democracy .\nIn 1970 , Marxist leader Salvador Allende was democratically elected president of Chile . Immediately after he was elected , the U.S. government poured resources into right-wing opposition groups and gave millions of dollars to Chile 's conservative media outlets .\nThe CIA deputy director of plans wrote in a 1970 memo , `` It is firm and continuing policy that Allende be overthrown by a coup ... It is imperative that these actions be implemented clandestinely and securely so that the USG [ U.S. government ] and American hand be well hidden . '' President Nixon subsequently ordered the CIA to `` make the economy scream '' in Chile , to `` prevent Allende from coming to power or to unseat him . ''\nAllende 's democratic government was violently overthrown on September 11 , 1973 . He died in the coup , just after making an emotional speech , in which he declared he would give his life to defend Chilean democracy and sovereignty .\nFar-right dictator Augusto Pinochet , who combined fascistic police state repression with hyper-capitalist free-market economic policies , was put into power . Under Pinochet 's far-right dictatorship , tens of thousands of Chilean leftists , labor organizers , and journalists were killed , disappeared , and tortured . Hundreds of thousands more people were forced into exile .\nOne of the most prevailing myths of the Cold War is that socialism was an unpopular system imposed on populations with brute force . Chile serves as a prime historical example of how the exact opposite was true . The masses of impoverished and oppressed people elected many socialist governments , yet these governments were often violently overthrown by the U.S. and other Western allies .\nThe overthrow of Allende was a turning point for many socialists in the Global South . Before he was overthrown , some leftists thought popular Marxist movements could gain state power through democratic elections , as was the case in Chile . Yet when they saw how the U.S. violently toppled Allende 's elected government , they became suspicious of the prospects of electoral politics and turned to guerrilla warfare and other tactics .\nThese are just a small sample of the great many regime changes the U.S. government has been involved in . More recent examples , which were supported by Hillary Clinton , as Sanders implied , include the U.S. government 's overthrow of Saddam Hussein in Iraq and Muammar Qadhafi in Libya . In these cases , the U.S. was overthrowing dictators , not democratically elected leaders -- but , as Sanders pointed out , the results of these regime changes have been nothing short of catastrophic .\nThe U.S. is also still engaging in regime change when it comes to democratically elected governments .\nIn the January 2011 revolution , Egyptians toppled dictator Hosni Mubarak , a close U.S. ally who ruled Egypt with an iron fist for almost 30 years .\nIn July 2013 , Egypt 's first democratically elected president , Mohammed Morsi , was overthrown in a military coup . We now know that the U.S. supported and bankrolled the opposition forces that overthrew the democratically elected president .\nToday , Abdel Fattah el-Sisi , a brutal despot who is widely recognized as even worse than Mubarak , reigns over Egypt . In August 2013 , Sisi oversaw a slaughter of more than 800 peaceful Egyptian activists at Raba ' a Square . His regime continues to shoot peaceful protesters in the street . An estimated 40,000 political prisoners languish in Sisi 's jails , including journalists .\nIn spite of his obscene human rights abuses , Sisi remains a close ally of the U.S. and Israel -- much , much closer than was the democratically elected President Morsi .\nIn the second Democratic presidential debate , when Sanders called Clinton out on her hawkish , pro-regime change policies , she tried to blame the disasters in the aftermath in countries like Iraq and Libya on the `` complexity '' of the Middle East . As an example of this putative complexity , Clinton cited Egypt . `` We saw a dictator overthrown , we saw Muslim Brotherhood president installed , and then we saw him ousted and the army back , '' she said .\nClinton failed to mention two crucial factors : One , that the U.S. backed Mubarak until the last moment ; and two , that the U.S. also supported the coup that overthrew Egypt 's first and only democratically elected head of state .\nThere are scores of other examples of U.S.-led regime change .\nIn 1964 the U.S. backed a coup in Brazil , toppling left-wing President Jo\u00e3o Goulart .\nIn 1976 , the U.S. supported a military coup in Argentina that replaced President Isabel Per\u00f3n with General Jorge Rafael Videla .\nIn 2002 , the U.S. backed a coup that overthrew democratically elected Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez . Ch\u00e1vez was so popular , however , that Venezuelans filled the street and demanded him back .\nIn 2004 , the U.S. overthrew Haiti 's first democratically elected president , Jean-Bertrand Aristide .\nIn 2009 , U.S.-trained far-right forces overthrew the democratically elected government of Honduras , with tacit support from Washington .\nLatin America , given its proximity to the U.S. and the strength of left-wing movements in the region , tends to endure the largest number of U.S. regime changes , yet the Middle East and many parts of Africa have seen their democratic governments overthrown as well .\nFrom 1898 to 1994 , Harvard University historian John Coatsworth documented at least 41 U.S. interventions in Latin America -- an average of one every 28 months for an entire century .\nNumerous Latin American military dictators were trained at the School of the Americas , a U.S. Department of Defense Institute in Fort Benning , Georgia . The School of the Americas Watch , an activist organization that pushes for the closing of the SOA , has documented many of these regime changes , which have been carried out by both Republicans and Democrats .\nDiplomatic cables released by whistleblowing journalism outlet WikiLeaks show the U.S. still maintains a systematic campaign of trying to overthrow Latin America 's left-wing governments .\nBy not just acknowledging the bloody and ignominious history of U.S. regime change , but also condemning it , Sen. Sanders was intrepidly trekking into controversial political territory into which few of his peers would dare to tread . Others would do well to learn from Bernie 's example .",
