    "content": "Conservatives and the Never Trump movement are discouraged and rightfully so . Despite 60 percent of Republicans voting against Donald Trump this primary season , he is now the presumptive GOP nominee . A plurality of the voters have essentially allowed a stranger in our house .\nThe problem of conservatives staying home on Election Day is something that needs to be reversed . If it is not , Republicans will likely lose not just the White House but their majority in the Senate . Their fight to hold it is an uphill battle already , but conservatives staying home would result in a Majority Leader Chuck Schumer . Already at risk are incumbents Kelly Ayotte , Mark Kirk , Ron Johnson , Rob Portman , Pat Toomey , Roy Blunt and John McCain , as well as the seat being vacated by Marco Rubio .\nThere are three ways to avoid conservatives being disenfranchised and not participating in November . First , the delegates at the Republican National Convention could stage some sort of coup that sees Trump lose the nomination . But this is not going to happen . Republicans are resigned to Trump as the nominee and delegates won \u2019 t rock the boat .\nNext , Trump finds a way to connect with and energize those on the legions on the right that say they will not vote for him . His relationship with conservatives has always been tenuous . Trump has had more positions on conservative issues than there are in the Kama Sutra . From four different positions on abortion in less than four days to not being willing to raise the Social Security retirement age to even pushing for the individual mandate . He has said he hates Obamacare , but he wants to just replace it with a better version of it\u2014of course , Trump says he will do so by making \u201c great deals . \u201d\nReconciliation is a long shot . It seems clear that the division within the Republican Party is vast and will not be repaired until , at the very earliest , after the election . Trump unifying the GOP is as likely as my going on a date with Jennifer Lawrence .\nThis leaves us with the third option : a viable third-party presidential candidate whom conservatives would be excited about . Were a Ben Sasse , Tom Coburn , James Mattis ( who already declined once ) , even a Mitt Romney or other conservative would improve the odds for many Senate Republicans just by energizing the conservative base . Without this viable third-party candidate , House and Senate Republicans are going to lose .\nLet \u2019 s not kid ourselves ; we conservatives hold no illusion that a third-party candidate would be able to capture the 270 electoral votes required to win the presidency . The best this candidate could hope for would be no candidate hitting 270 and the election going to the House of Representatives , where skillful lobbying would secure the presidency . But the chances that the election turns to the House are minimal . We \u2019 re probably looking at President Hillary Clinton , and we know it .\nBeing the viable third-party presidential contender is a suicide mission of sorts . It is a form of self-sacrifice that demonstrates a willingness to endure the hardships of the campaign trail . Granted , it could also be argued that it is a sign of stupidity . From endless fundraisers and rubber chicken dinners to having every facet of your life picked apart by opponents and the press , it is not an enjoyable experience . In fact , it \u2019 s likely that what you will be remembered for will be some flaw that was exposed . Just ask Rick \u201c Oops \u201d Perry , \u201c Lyin \u2019 Ted \u201d Cruz , John \u201c Flip Flop \u201d Kerry , Michael \u201c Willie Horton \u201d Dukakis , and numerous others .\nIf and when Trump loses in November , this third-party candidate would be scapegoated by Trump supporters as the reason that Trump lost . It would be pure fiction , as Trump will be the reason for his own loss . The misogyny , the xenophobia , the childish insults , the utter lack of actual policy and the paucity of understanding of the issues will be his downfall . Voters already know who Trump is and what he represents . Given the level of fanatical zeal with which Trump \u2019 s supporters attack opponents , especially online , this third-party candidate will face a vicious amount of backlash and harassment .\nHowever , this candidate would be fondly remembered in conservative circles . After the general election , the Republican Party will begin to rebuild . The third-party candidate who ran to save vulnerable House and Senate Republicans would be an immediate leader whose voice would carry weight .
