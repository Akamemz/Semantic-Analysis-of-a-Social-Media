    "content": "While the mainstream news media hunts for evidence of Trump-Russia collusion , the public record shows that Democrats have willfully used Moscow disinformation to influence the presidential election against Donald Trump and attack his administration .\nThe disinformation came in the form of a Russian-fed dossier written by former British intelligence agent Christopher Steele . It contains a series of unverified criminal charges against Mr. Trump \u2019 s campaign aides , such as coordinating Moscow \u2019 s hacking of Democratic Party computers .\nSome Democrats have widely circulated the discredited information . Mr. Steele was paid by the Democrat-funded opposition research firm Fusion GPS with money from a Hillary Clinton backer . Fusion GPS distributed the dossier among Democrats and journalists . The information fell into the hands of the FBI , which used it in part to investigate Mr. Trump \u2019 s campaign aides .\nMr. Steele makes clear that his unproven charges came almost exclusively from sources linked to the Kremlin and Russian President Vladimir Putin . He identified his sources as \u201c a senior Russian Foreign Ministry figure , \u201d a former \u201c top level Russian intelligence officer active inside the Kremlin , \u201d a \u201c senior Kremlin official \u201d and a \u201c senior Russian government official . \u201d\nThe same Democrats who have condemned Russia \u2019 s election interference via plying fake news and hacking email servers have quoted freely from the Steele anti-Trump memos derived from creatures of the Kremlin .\nIn other words , there is public evidence of significant , indirect collusion between Democrats and Russian disinformation , a Trump supporter said .\nSEE ALSO : Trump , Schumer , Clinton , Kushner and the \u2018 sleazy \u2019 Adam Schiff\n\u201c If anyone colluded with the Russians , it was the Democrats , \u201d said a former Trump campaign adviser who asked not to be identified because of the pending investigations . \u201c After all , they \u2019 ve routinely shopped around false claims from the debunked Steele dossier , which listed sources including senior Kremlin officials . If anyone should be investigated in Washington , it ought to be Adam Schiff , Eric Swalwell , Mark Warner and their staffers . \u201d\nThat is a reference to Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California , the top Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence ; Sen. Mark R. Warner , Virginia Democrat and vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence ; and Rep. Eric Swalwell , a California , Democrat on the House intelligence panel .\nBy his own admission , Mr. Steele \u2019 s work has proved unreliable .\nAs first reported by The \u2588\u2588\u2588 on April 25 , Mr. Steele filed a document in a sealed court case in London acknowledging that a major dossier charge about hacking Democrats \u2019 computers was unverified . The entire dossier never should have been made public and Fusion GPS should not have passed it around , Mr. Steele said in a filing defending himself against a libel charge .\nOther dossier targets vehemently deny the dirt thrown by the Kremlin sources .\nMr. Steele \u2019 s Russian sources accused Mr. Trump \u2019 s attorney , Michael Cohen , of attending a meeting with Russian agents in Prague to cover up their role in Moscow \u2019 s hacking . Mr. Cohen has said he has never been to Prague and was in California at the time .\nOne of the main targets of Mr. Steele \u2019 s Russian sources is Carter Page , who lived and worked in Moscow as a Merrill Lynch investor . He had loose ties to the Trump campaign as a foreign policy adviser and surrogate .\nMr. Steele \u2019 s Russian sources accused Mr . Page of a series of crimes : teaming up with former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort to help Russia hack Democratic computers , meeting in Moscow with two Putin cronies to plot against Mrs. Clinton and working out a shady brokerage deal with a Russian oligarch .\nMr . Page told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 that he has never met Mr. Manafort , knew nothing about Russian hacking when it was happening , never met the two Russians named by Mr. Steele and never completed the supposed investment deal .\nThe dossier accusations against Mr . Page surfaced during the campaign in a Yahoo News story , citing not Mr. Steele but intelligence sources . It then went out on the U.S. government \u2019 s Voice of America .\nIn the meantime , the Clinton campaign used the Yahoo story to attack Mr. Trump : \u201c Hillary for America Statement on Bombshell Report About Trump Aide \u2019 s Chilling Ties to Kremlin , \u201d blared the Clinton campaign \u2019 s Sept. 23 press release .\nSince the dossier was circulated widely among Democrats , Mr . Page said , he believes the Clinton team possessed it and relied on it based on what some of Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s surrogates said publicly .\n\u201c After the report by Yahoo News , the Clinton campaign put out an equally false press release just minutes after the article was released that afternoon , \u201d said Mr . Page , who has tracked what he believes is a series of inaccurate stories and accusations against him .\n\u201c Of course , the [ Clinton campaign representatives ] were lying about it with the media nonstop for many months , and they \u2019 ve continued until this day , \u201d Mr . Page said . \u201c Both indirectly as they planted articles in the press and directly with many TV appearances . \u201d\nEven before the Yahoo story , then-Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid , Nevada Democrat , was using the Russian-sourced dossier .\nOn Aug. 27 , with the campaign in high gear and knowledge that Russian hackers had penetrated Clinton campaign computers in the public domain , Mr. Reid released a letter to then-FBI Director James B. Comey .\nMr. Reid called for an investigation into Mr. Page \u2019 s trip to Moscow , where he supposedly \u201c met with high-ranking sanctioned individuals . Any such meetings should be investigated and made part of the public record . \u201d\nMr. Reid \u2019 s evidence surely came from the dossier and its Russian sources .\nIn the dossier , Mr. Steele clearly states that his anti-Trump accusations are from the Kremlin , which means some Democrats have been willingly repeating Moscow propaganda for public consumption in Washington .\nNo Democrats have embraced the Russian-sourced dossier more than members of the House intelligence committee , which is investigating Moscow \u2019 s interference in the election .\nMr. Schiff read from the dossier extensively at a March hearing featuring Mr. Comey and Navy Adm. Michael Rogers , who leads the National Security Agency .\nAs Mr. Schiff and other Democrats were bemoaning Kremlin activities against Mrs. Clinton , they were more than willing to quote Kremlin sources attacking Mr. Trump during the election campaign .\nMr. Schiff lauded Mr. Steele for disclosing that Rosneft , a Russian-owned gas and oil company , planned to sell a 19.5 percent share to an investor and that Mr . Page was offered a brokerage fee .\nTrouble is , the 19.5 percent share was announced publicly by Moscow before Mr. Steele wrote that memo . Mr . Page said he was never involved in any talk about a commission .\nMr. Schiff was more than willing to quote Kremlin sources .\n\u201c According to Steele \u2019 s Russian sources , the campaign has offered documents damaging to Hillary Clinton , which the Russians would publish through an outlet that gives them deniability like WikiLeaks , \u201d he said .\nMr. Schiff also said : \u201c According to Christopher Steele , a former British intelligence officer , who is reportedly held in high regard by U.S. intelligence , Russian sources tell him that Page has also had a secret meeting with Igor Sechin , CEO of the Russian gas giant , Rosneft . Sechin is reported to be a former KGB agent and close friend of Putin \u2019 s . \u201d\nMr . Page has said repeatedly that he does not know Mr. Sechin and did not meet with him in Moscow .\nMeanwhile , Rep.

The allegations it raises about President Trump \u2019 s campaign aides \u2019 connections to Russians , when overlaid with known established facts and timelines from the 2016 campaign , are very revealing , \u201d he said .\nRep.
