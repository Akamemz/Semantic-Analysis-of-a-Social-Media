    "content": "The new senator needed to hire staff to work in his new office , and after an interview with a then-young Joe Biden , the Delaware Morning News reported that the ideal job applicant would be one who shared his opposition \u201c to such liberal shibboleths as gun control . \u201d\nIn 1973 , Biden described himself as \u201c really liberal to moderate , \u201d and the newly minted lawmaker destined to become vice president decades later would even say during that same interview that he was a \u201c social conservative. \u201d His early time in the Senate shows as much .\nBiden earned favorable grades from the NRA during his first two terms -- solid B \u2019 s in 1978 and 1984 . He accepted campaign contributions ahead of his second election from the original manufacturer of the AR-15 , Colt Industries . He voted to allow the interstate sale of handguns , successful legislation that the press heralded in 1985 as \u201c a major victory for gun owners , dealers and the National Rifle Association . \u201d\nAnd yet , Biden has as sterling of a gun control reputation as any of the candidates competing for the Democratic nomination in 2020 , if not better . He helped pass gun control legislation when Mayor Pete Buttigieg was in middle school , then followed up on his work in the Senate during his two terms in the Obama White House .\nAll of this allows the former vice president to say with confidence , as he often does , that he took on the NRA twice , and won . Now , as the pro-gun Democrat of the 1980s goes extinct and a more confident gun-control party emerges , Biden hopes his record will help make him president .\nThe front-runner released a detailed gun control agenda in October , drawing on his decades of experience : Ban the assault weapon . End the high-capacity magazine . Launch a federal buy-back program for newly banned firearms . These are just some of the top priorities that a Biden presidency would try to work into law .\n\u201c I \u2019 m so tired of people talking about your prayers , \u201d Biden said last week at a California event about 45 miles south of Santa Clarita , where the latest school shooting took place . \u201c Damn it , we have to protect these kids . We have to do it now . \u201d\nIf anything , the famously friendly politician has become more aggressive and impatient . He complains that Canadian geese get more protection than American schoolchildren . He regularly lambasts the gun lobby . He labels gun manufacturers , including a former donor , \u201c the enemy . \u201d\nThis is a far cry from previous Democrats who thought they had to send mixed messages , the enduring image being John Kerry dressed up in camouflage and toting a 12-gauge shotgun as he posed with four dead geese in a carefully choreographed photo op on Ohio farmland two weeks before the 2004 presidential election . The campaign was trying to show that the candidate , who supported gun control , supported hunters . It didn \u2019 t work .\nDemocrats would lose that state and the White House -- and Bob Shrum , a senior adviser to Kerry \u2019 s campaign , would later acknowledge that putting the nominee in camo was a mistake . \u201c I wouldn \u2019 t recommend doing that today , \u201d he told \u2588\u2588\u2588 , \u201c Indeed , I didn \u2019 t recommend doing it at the time . \u201d\nIt isn \u2019 t that Democrats no longer say they \u2019 re pro-hunting anymore . According to Shrum , it is that everything else has changed : \u201c Substantively , I don \u2019 t think there was that much difference between then and now . The big difference is obviously the politics of the issue . It was a much tougher issue in 2004 than it is in 2019 and heading into 2020 . \u201d\nNot long ago , powerful Democrats publicly urged their colleagues to avoid the gun issue . After announcing his retirement from the House , famed Massachusetts liberal Barney Frank said it was a mistake \u201c to insist that every Democrat be for gun control. \u201d In December 2011 , Frank said gun control was \u201c a great loser for us in most of the country . \u201d\nA year later , almost to the day , a shooter killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown , Conn. Horrific mass shootings followed in Orlando , Las Vegas , El Paso and numerous other American cities . They would all be galvanizing , prominent Democrat Matt Bennett told RCP , if there weren \u2019 t so many .\nThe carnage hasn \u2019 t swayed primary voters as much as it \u2019 s moved their kids . \u201c The thing that has brought this into focus most sharply , \u201d said Bennett , a veteran of the Clinton White House , \u201c is that almost every child in the United States goes through lockdown drills now , and they go home to tell their parents , who are confronted with the idea that someone could come into their child \u2019 s school and shoot them . \u201d\nAggressive reform has subsequently become canon in the Democratic Party .
