It would reward states that comply with financial incentives by making it easier for them to get federal grants . And it would penalize federal agencies that fail to report to the system by barring bonus pay for political appointees .\nJohn Feinblatt , the president of Everytown for Gun Safety , an advocacy group here , praised the measure as \u201c an important first step \u201d to improve the background check system .\nThe massacre in Texas showed once again that the computerized background check program is only as good as the data that is put into it . The 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech brought attention to the system \u2019 s flaws after it was revealed that the gunman , Seung-Hui Cho , had been ordered by a court into mental health treatment , but that court order had not been forwarded to the background check database , a failure that may have allowed him to purchase his arsenal .\nAlthough the gun debate is contentious in Congress , surveys show the majority of Americans \u2014 even those in households with guns \u2014 want to see gun safety laws passed . A poll released Thursday by Quinnipiac University found that 60 percent of voters favor stricter gun laws , and 59 percent say it is too easy to buy a gun in the United States . The survey also found that 94 percent of those living in households with guns favor universal background checks for gun buyers .",
