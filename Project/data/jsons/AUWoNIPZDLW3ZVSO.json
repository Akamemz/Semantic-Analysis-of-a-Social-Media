    "content": "What did the network find \u201c indefensible \u201d ? Two mocking words from a mocking sentence in a two-day old column that appeared in this space in The \u2588\u2588\u2588 and were repeated on Twitter . After speculating on just how the far-left Media Matters would rewrite the First Amendment , the next line in the column read :\nThe \u2588\u2588\u2588 has been unable to confirm reports that the original draft of this Media Matters revision ended with the words : \u201c Sieg Heil ! \u201d\nFor two days this column , titled \u201c Fascist Media Matters Moves to Silence Hannity : Free speech under assault from Soros group \u201d \u2014 a column that went after the goons of the far left Media Matters and their relentless Nazi-style attempt to intimidate the sponsors of television and radio shows featuring conservatives \u2014 sat posted prominently on this very site . My condemnation and mockery of the left-wing group and its tactics \u2014 something I have written about as far back as five years ago \u2014 was in plain sight for all to read . The reaction from CNN ? Total silence . Which is as it should be . CNN has every right to decide who is on its air \u2014 no right to edit the works of any of the various writers who ply their trade daily from publications ranging the political gamut from The \u2588\u2588\u2588 to the New York Times . It was only when I posted those final two mocking words from the column on Twitter that CNN abruptly \u2014 angrily \u2014 reacted .\nWhere to start by way of a response ? Let \u2019 s start with the easiest part and go from there .\nI totally disagree that it is \u201c indefensible \u201d \u2014 much less inappropriate \u2014 to mock and condemn either those who use Nazi-style tactics or Nazis , neo-Nazis , white nationalists and white supremacists \u2014 all of which were tragically on display in Charlottesville , Virginia , over the weekend . Mocking and condemning is one of many ways to discredit these despicable human beings and their despicable philosophy . The very idea of treating any of those tactics , groups , or individuals with the kid gloves of a hyperventilating political correctness is itself \u201c indefensible \u201d \u2014 turning a blind eye to the horrific ideas and methods that lie behind them .\nThere is a mind-boggling contradiction here . As this is written CNN \u2014 and CNN is far from alone \u2014 is sharply criticizing President Trump \u2019 s first statement on the violence from the \u201c alt-right \u201d and white supremacists \u2014 Neo-Nazis , the Ku Klux Klan and others \u2014 in Charlottesville . Here \u2019 s the headline from the CNN website :\nTrump \u2014 once again \u2014 fails to condemn the alt-right , white supremacists\nBridgewater , New Jersey ( CNN ) President Donald Trump , a man known for his bluntness , was anything but on Saturday , failing to name the white supremacists or alt-right groups at the center of violent protests in Charlottesville , Virginia .\nAs noted , one liberal media outlet after another ran with some version of this story . The point in all of them : the President fails to call out \u201c alt-right , white supremacists. \u201d ( Eventually the White House put out a second statement saying the President \u201c condemns all forms of violence , bigotry , and hatred , and of course that includes white supremacists , KKK , neo-Nazi , and all extremist groups . \u201d\nBut in fact , when I mocked and condemned exactly a bigoted group like this \u2014 the \u201c alt-left \u201d Media Matters and their Nazi/Fascist style tactics , tactics I have previously detailed \u2014 CNN fired me for doing what it was now demanding exactly that the President do . Apparently there are two very different standards for calling out those who use Nazi/fascist style tactics . And to be certain there is no mistake \u2014 the white nationalists and white supremacists , the Klan and all the rest of the bigots who showed up in Charlottesville have no place in the American civil society . Period .\nContrary to the CNN idea that mocking and condemning Nazi-style behavior is \u201c indefensible \u201d is the reality that mocking Nazi-like behavior not to mention Nazis themselves has a considerable history in the world of popular American culture . From Charlie Chaplain \u2019 s 1940 film The Great Dictator to Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi \u2019 s The Blues Brothers to the old CBS comedy Hogan \u2019 s Heroes and Mel Brooks \u2019 Springtime for Hitler time and time again the mocking of Nazis or their tactics has become a recurring feature in the American arts . The principle is simple : condemnation by ridicule . Which is exactly what I was doing with that line in my column : condemnation of extremists by using ridicule . And I used much more than ridicule .\nWith reason . For a host of obvious horrific reasons , Nazism led eventually to murderous methods used to implement the idea behind it . Nazism and its corollary idea of a state-run media stands alongside Communism as the world \u2019 s worst and most evil governing philosophies \u2014 both of which made a point of controlling the flow of information by deciding who did \u2014 and who did not \u2014 get to speak in the mass media of the day . It is politics and journalism as practiced by sadistic gangsters . To ever , at any time , give a pass to those who traffic in either the philosophy or tactics of this garbage is , yes , \u201c indefensible . \u201d\nAmong the tools used by Nazis to control the media of the day in Germany was this section from the Constitution of the German Reich , as provided here by the University of South Florida \u2019 s A Teachers Guide to the Holocaust :\nThus , restrictions on personal liberty , on the right of free expression of opinion , including freedom of the press , on the right of assembly and the right of association , and violations of the privacy of postal , telegraphic , and telephonic communications , and warrants for house-searchers , orders for confiscations as well as restrictions on property , are also permissible beyond the legal limits otherwise prescribed .\nTranslated into modern usage by Media Matters this jewel of suppression goes like this , a direct quote provided by the Associated Press from Angelo Carusone , the group \u2019 s president , from his latest anti-free speech venture \u2014 this latest one with the goal of driving Fox \u2019 s Sean Hannity off the air :\nAdvertisers will get burned if they continue to associate with Hannity \u2014 plain and simple .\nNote well , CNN . The man said : \u201c Advertisers will get burned\u2026 \u201d\nHow exactly do advertisers get \u201c burned \u201d by Media Matters ? What does this mean in practice ? Why do I feel so strongly about this ? Let me give you an example of how this game of \u201c burn the sponsors \u201d is played .\nIn 2012 , an advertiser targeted in this fashion was Mark Stevens , the founder and CEO of the MSCO marketing firm located in Rye , New York . His sin ? Stevens advertised his company , which has nothing to do with politics , on The Rush Limbaugh Show although just in the New York City media market where the company did business . Several years ago Stevens stepped forward to describe what had happened to him as a result . I interviewed him and wrote about it at the time here .\nAs Media Matters pressed its \u201c Stop Rush \u201d campaign with Limbaugh advertisers in the wake of the Sandra Fluke affair , calls suddenly began pouring into Stevens \u2019 company from across the country \u2014 even though his Limbaugh ads ran only in the New York area \u2014 warning Stevens that he and his company \u2019 s \u201c every move \u201d were now \u201c under surveillance. \u201d Watch here as Stevens discusses the \u201c insidious \u201d hatred and vitriol that poured in to his company , a company with a high percentage of female employees , when he refused to bow to pressure \u2014 as CNN has just done in my case \u2014 and pull his ads from the Limbaugh show . There were threats of physical violence , with female employees assailed as \u201c sluts. \u201d A company vice president , a 30-year-old woman , was called a \u201c woman hater. \u201d ( Can you say \u201c violence against women \u201d ? ) Emails \u2014 tens of thousands of hostile emails that were frequently \u201c all the damn same \u201d began arriving from senders calling themselves a \u201c Citizen of the Internet \u201d or \u201c Policeman of the Internet. \u201d Stevens received threats that busloads of people were coming to his home and he was warned that his personal safety was in danger . \u201c This is crazy \u201d he told Megyn Kelly .\nThis was no boycott , Stevens said . He and his company were the target of an \u201c organized terrorist attack. \u201d He declined to finger Media Matters on air , saying he had no evidence . But he said instead the people he suspected were \u201c the usual suspects . \u201d\nThe usual suspects indeed . Media Matters then \u2014 as now \u2014 was decidedly not shy about claiming credit for the Stop Rush campaign pressuring advertisers to leave Limbaugh \u2019 s show . Carusone ( in Carusone \u2019 s own words ) presented himself all over the press with his Stop Rush movement . Carusone said he \u201c started talking to ( Rush Limbaugh ) advertisers on Thursday , and got a lot of feedback on Friday , and I knew a lot of movement was taking place . This was important to think about from a business perspective. \u201d So lovely . Angelo Carusone and Media Matters as a combination of Martin Luther King and Gandhi , yes ? All you need is love . Kumbaya .\nIn the world of hard reality for those at the receiving end of Media Matters \u2019 tactics ? Decidedly not .\nI wrote that Stevens , when I interviewed him , was also struck by the thousands of supportive emails and snail mails he received from Americans across the country who had heard his story as told to Fox hosts Stuart Varney ( as here ) and Megyn Kelly . He was very disturbed about the concerns he read from his supporters . They were , Stevens said , frightened that he had somehow \u201c violated the rules of a totalitarian society. \u201d As I wrote :\nSome ( of his supportive ) e-mails came from professionals , accompanied by photos of badges or official ID with police forces as far away as Los Angeles . Mark understood . He too had developed this uneasy feeling that standing up in today \u2019 s America was \u201c like being an outspoken critic of the government under a totalitarian regime. \u201d He paused . \u201c We don \u2019 t have it yet , \u201d he mused , \u201c but it \u2019 s too much like that . \u201d\nTo erase all doubt about the role of Media Matters in these hate-fests , here , again from the AP story just the other day , is this , bold print supplied by me :\nMedia Matters for America said Friday it will begin asking Hannity \u2019 s advertisers to shun him and will ask thousands of its members to also contact companies . The group is setting up a stophannity.com website and plans to hire a plane to carry an anti-Hannity banner in the New York area .\nThis is the front end of a \u201c burning \u201d of advertisers by Media Matters , and what happened to Mark Stevens five years ago when the assault was directed at Rush Limbaugh is the reality of how it manifests itself with threats of physical violence , vitriolic phone calls , and thousands of emails .\nTo criticize , condemn , or mock these Nazi-style tactics by calling out the group in question and its leadership by name is \u2014 which as CNN has just demonstrated in my case \u2014 hazardous . Media Matters went to work on CNN using their old and now very well used playbook . As they turned their tactics on Rush Limbaugh and now Hannity , they have just done the same to me . And CNN folded .\nTo actually call attention to the flagrantly gangster-style methods of Media Matters is to risk entering the Orwellian world of the Liberal State Media . They are against calling out a group for their tactics \u2014 until they are for it . To protest political gangsterism is to risk being labeled a gangster . Or in my case , condemning and mocking the Nazi-style tactics of Media Matters is to open oneself to being labeled outside the bounds of simple decency if not actually a Nazi . Unless , of course , the President is perceived as not doing it in the Charlottesville episode , in which case CNN and all the rest pile on him for not doing exactly what I did \u2014 and got fired for .\nI \u2019 m sorry , but there are zero circumstances in which I am going to allow CNN to portray my staunchly and consistent opposition to Nazi-style tactics as somehow a wildly spit-up-on-the-dinner-table totally inappropriate moment worthy of instant banishment from The Most Trusted Name in News . Are you kidding ? I do think CNN execs honestly don \u2019 t get this \u2014 the liberal media bubble and all of that . But my portrayal by CNN at my firing \u2014 implying that calling out the gangster/Nazi/Fascist style tactics of Media Matters , mocking them , writing yet again about what they are about in terms of shutting down conservatives is such an unreal , \u201c indefensible , \u201d inappropriate , and wildly untrue description of the first magnitude . The term \u201c fake news \u201d comes instantly to mind . No wonder the President of the United States is pissed at his one-time friend .\nI have smiled proudly as a CNN commentator at Trump rallies in the face of cries of \u201c CNN sucks. \u201d I never once failed to defend my CNN employer , my CNN colleagues , and my CNN friends . Never\u2026 never once . Only to see that in a blink \u2014 CNN abandoned me because I took on a far left organization that masquerades as some high minded media concern when it consistently employs the kind of tactics CNN is so quick to criticize when coming from some nutty right winger . Worse , CNN abandoned me for doing exactly what mere days later they were demanding the President do \u2014 bluntly name names of those whose tactics are completely off the charts of respectability .\nParticularly disturbing is that what just happened with me and CNN is not some sort of stand-alone . As with the Mark Stevens incident , from CNN to Google to college campuses and more , there is a rising tide of intolerance sweeping across major American institutions . All too frequently that intolerance is masked in terms of self-righteous political correctness .\nBill Maher , a liberal with whom I disagree on most things and , full disclosure , on whose HBO show I have appeared , is a true soldier of free speech and spoke out in my defense on\u2026 yes ! \u2026 CNN in a show with Fareed Zakaria . The headline from Deadline Hollywood :\nBill Maher Backs Canned Pundit Jeffrey Lord ; Says \u201c This Has Got To Stop \u201d\n\u201c I don \u2019 t know how long I \u2019 m going to last , really , \u201d Maher told Zakaria , bemoaning what he sees as today \u2019 s political correctness . \u201c It \u2019 s worse every year . The things that they go after people for now . Your colleague \u2014 I don \u2019 t agree with him \u2014 Jeffrey Lord , CNN got rid of him because he said sieg heil on a tweet . It was a joke . \u201c This has got to stop , this idea that people have to go away if they \u2019 ve offended me even for one moment . How about just move on , turn the page , go to the next thing in your life ? \u201d\nThere is more to the old-fashioned use of double-standards . As I made the rounds of radio shows from coast-to-coast the day after my firing I was repeatedly asked about CNN \u2019 s tolerance for those who , employed by CNN , have used social media or other forums to compare the President of the United States to Adolf Hitler or conservatives to Nazis . I had to confess my ignorance as I was not aware . Over at Fox , Mark Steyn and Pete Hegseth , criticizing CNN for their decision , made the point that \u2014 if one is a liberal \u2014 Nazi references are not only never assailed by CNN as \u201c indefensible \u201d they most assuredly are not followed by a summary firing . They are in fact not even noticed , given a total pass if not being treated as A-OK . I was also asked numerous times if CNN had wanted to get rid of me and merely was cynically using this as an excuse , something that was also said by Rush Limbaugh on his Friday show . I replied that I had no evidence of that .\nCNN has put itself in the position of firing me for mocking and condemning Angelo Carusone as the employer of Nazi-style tactics . As noted in my original column from last Tuesday , there was this discovery from the Daily Caller about Carusone during his Stop Rush campaign . The headline :\nA top executive at Media Matters for America and the principal activist in the \u201c Stop Rush \u201d campaign made racist and anti-Semitic comments and disparaged \u201c trannies \u201d on a dormant blog that he wrote just several years prior to his prominent liberal activism career . Blog entries reviewed by The Daily Caller show that Angelo Carusone made derogatory remarks about ethnic groups and used language to insult \u201c trannies \u201d and ugly \u201c gays \u201d that would be considered hate speech by his own organization . Which is to say , CNN has now put itself in the position of firing me because I used a mocking Nazi salute to a guy who , again , was reported as having written \u201c Racist , Anti-Semitic , Anti- \u2018 Tranny \u2019 \u201d blog Posts . If I had said my mocking \u201c Sieg Heil \u201d to David Duke or Richard Spencer or the other racial , anti-Semitic obsessives tied in with the Klan or Nazis or Neo Nazis , would CNN have cared ? Call me skeptical .\nI \u2019 m sorry . But being fired for standing up against this kind of racist , anti-Semitic , and yes , anti-Transvestite garbage is simply wrong . In fact ? It is \u201c indefensible , \u201d not to mention totally inappropriate .\nWas there a better way for CNN to handle this ? Decidedly yes . If CNN were this upset about what I said in my column , then invite Angelo Carusone and/or Media Matters founder David Brock and myself on to CNN to debate \u2014 to discuss the issue of Media Matters activities in a civilized fashion in a session moderated by a CNN anchor . I \u2019 ve met David Brock in the CNN Green Room . The only thing that occurred was a polite handshake , my hand extended first . Instead , the network allowed itself to be bullied into submission by the standard Media Matters assault opening itself to unwanted and decidedly unnecessary criticism as craven , intolerant , and mean spirited . Things that I know from my personal experience at CNN are simply not true .\nThere is a larger , albeit subjective and political , concern here as well for the network . CNN tries to position itself as neither Right ( like Fox ) or Left ( as with MSNBC ) but rather as the Center \u2014 straight down the middle . But as I took CNN questions from talk radio hosts , the issue of the famous and ongoing battle between President Trump and CNN was repeatedly raised . In fact , it was clear that CNN was seen as not The Center but as an only slightly paler MSNBC \u2014 or sometimes even further to the Left . I was even asked if the White House/CNN clash was not ideological at all but rather nothing more than a high stakes , high visibility personal fight between President Trump and his onetime friend CNN President Jeff Zucker , with the latter cast as some sort of Captain Ahab obsessively attacking his white whale \u2014 the President .\nI have nothing but wonderful memories of my time at CNN , and many wonderful friendships that blossomed with it . On my end \u2014 in spite of the way some reading this rebuttal will take it \u2014 there is nothing but the greatest respect and affection from me for everyone there from Jeff Zucker on down . I \u2019 m just very , very disappointed at CNN \u2019 s conduct and with Jeff . In truth , I am incredulous . ( I can already hear the President of the United States whispering in my ear : \u201c I told you so . \u201d )\nIn fact , I have heard from so many CNNers privately . It is a mark of just how concerning this atmosphere of totalitarian-style repression that is abroad in the land is that I would never thank any of them by name in public for fear that \u2014 simply by guilt of association with me -they too would come under instant attack accompanied by a demand for removal from their job . Or worse , they could be deluged , as was Limbaugh advertiser Mark Stevens , with thousands of hostile emails and threats of physical violence .\nIn point of fact Jeff Zucker himself has been targeted for removal in various media accounts for exactly this reason \u2014 having me and other Trumpers on the air at all .\nA while back the New York Times Magazine featured Jeff under the title \u201c CNN Had a Problem . Donald Trump Solved It : Inside the strange symbiosis between Jeff Zucker and the president he helped create . \u201d\nAfter reading the article I sent Jeff a positive note . A few days later we crossed paths in a CNN newsroom . He thanked me for the note . Sympathetic to the heat he has taken for my presence , I told him : \u201c I \u2019 m expendable. \u201d To which Jeff replied with a shrug : \u201c We \u2019 re all expendable . \u201d\nThe irony ? In one of our first meetings , we were discussing conservative criticism of CNN , specifically by Rush Limbaugh . Jeff asked me of my CNN appearances : \u201c Have you ever been censored ? \u201d To which I replied with the absolute truth : \u201c No. \u201d Alas .\nAlas that is no longer true . For mocking bigotry \u2014 directly to a man whose blog posts were discovered to be in the words of that memorable story \u201c racist , anti-Semitic ( and ) Anti- \u2018 Tranny \u2019 and whose organization uses Nazi-style tactics of intimidation and fear against advertisers \u2014 I have not only been censored but summarily fired to please a left-wing lynch mob . A lynch mob that , as Mark Stevens attests , is all too willing to threaten physical violence in service to what Stevens called \u201c an organized terrorist action . \u201d\nThis isn \u2019 t a question of my abrupt dismissal being deeply , offensively wrong \u2014 which it is . Nor is this about the right of CNN to fire anyone it chooses . It most assuredly does have that right . I can understand the Kathy Griffin problem with a bloodied severed head of the President . But I did not understand the dismissal of Reza Aslan , the host of the CNN documentary series Believer . I don \u2019 t agree politically with Reza \u2014 we once debated on Don Lemon \u2019 s show . But in fact I told Jeff Zucker that if it helped I would be more than happy to speak up for Reza \u2019 s right to tweet offensive sentiments of President Trump . They had nothing to do with his show and he seemed to me from both debating him and watching his work that he was a decidedly good person with a sizable body of knowledge about his subject . Exactly the kind of person CNN or any other network should be pleased to host . While assailing the President in such vulgar terms ( a piece of excrement etc . ) isn \u2019 t tasteful , Americans have a long , colorful tradition of using strong and yes , even vulgar language to criticize presidents . My offer to defend Reza was declined .\nMy firing by CNN mirrors the Google firing of memo-writer techie James Damore . Damore wrote of his firing in the Wall Street Journal , saying among other things , this \u2014 with bold print supplied by me :\nEcho chambers maintain themselves by creating a shared spirit and keeping discussion confined within certain limits . As Noam Chomsky once observed , \u201c The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion , but allow very lively debate within that spectrum. \u201d But echo chambers also have to guard against dissent and opposition . Whether it \u2019 s in our homes , online or in our workplaces , a consensus is maintained by shaming people into conformity or excommunicating them if they persist in violating taboos . Public shaming serves not only to display the virtue of those doing the shaming but also warns others that the same punishment awaits them if they don \u2019 t conform .\nIndeed . I have all of a sudden without warning been excommunicated by CNN , as Damore was at Google . In my case it is because I violated a liberal taboo \u2014 Nazi references are OK when applied to supposed \u201c right wingers \u201d but never , ever to \u201c left-wingers . \u201d\nOver at the New York Times , new-columnist arrival Bret Stephens \u2014 an ex-pat Never Trumper from the conservative editorial pages of the Wall Street Journal \u2014 received a whiff of the public shaming treatment dished to the disreputable likes of Damore and myself by Google and CNN when he ventured onto the sacred liberal turf of climate change . As noted by Mark Hemingway in the Weekly Standard :\nSince publishing its debut column by Bret Stephens , the New York Times has been under siege by angry readers posting screenshots on social media of them canceling their subscriptions.\u2026 Stephens \u2019 s objectionable column \u2014 which is well worth reading \u2014 is about the left \u2019 s unhealthy impulse toward blacklisting anyone who doesn \u2019 t validate the political and scientific consensus of left-leaning American elites , never mind that we \u2019 ve reached a point where precious few people even bother articulating the difference between the two . It \u2019 s pretty clear that the attack on Stephens boils down to one thing : He \u2019 s a conservative telling liberals what they don \u2019 t want to hear , and in this case , need to hear .\nI violated the \u201c political \u2026consensus of left-leaning American elites \u201d so , like Damore and that brush-back warning to Bret Stephens , I had to go from CNN when I accused a far-Left group of Nazi-style thuggery and mocked them with that tweeted \u201c Sieg Heil. \u201d Do I think for one moment that my CNN colleagues would ever consciously endorse the kind of Nazi-style tactics that attacked a private citizen like Mark Stevens ? Not a prayer . But CNN is for whatever reason willfully blind to the reality of the ferocious ideological savageness behind all of this , the kind of ideological savagery that confronted Mark Stevens and who knows how many other advertisers targeted by Media Matters . They see it when it comes from Nazi-style tactics in Charlottesville , but eyes remain closed when it comes from the Left side of the political highway .\nBut in reality my firing from CNN has nothing to do with me .\nMy firing raises a basic , fundamental question of whether a free press and those who work in that free press \u2014 conservative or liberal or other ( and in my case as a television commentator ) \u2014 can do their job or even have a robust Twitter back-and-forth with a critic . In yet another irony , earlier this year I attended the White House Correspondents \u2019 Dinner as a CNN guest . Hanging above the dais was a banner proclaiming in capital letters :\nAgain , CNN has the absolute right to hire and fire anyone they choose . But in fact it is closing its eyes to a deliberate , repeated assault by Media Matters on the rights contained in that amendment .\nWhat happens when some group out there on the Right copies the tactics of Media Matters ? What happens when the target is no longer Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh or Glenn Beck or Bill O \u2019 Reilly or me but Anderson Cooper , Don Lemon , Erin Burnett , Wolf Blitzer , Jake Tapper , Brooke Baldwin , Kate Bolduan , John Berman , Poppy Harlow , Chris Cuomo and Alisyn Camerota ? In fact , days before I was fired CNN drew criticism from , yes , Media Matters for having me and other supporters of the President on air at all . A shot across the CNN bow .\nI was asked post-firing if I was going to apologize . It was noted to me that people in my situation usually and quickly do so . In fact , speaking of Reza Aslan , Reza did just that .\nIn my case ? Not only is my answer to apologizing \u201c no \u201d \u2014 you can make that \u201c hell no ! \u201d I joked with reporter Candy Woodall from the Harrisburg Patriot-News and it \u2019 s on-line site PennLive site \u2014 that my reply to that question on the very day that I was fired from CNN became Day One of my No Apology Tour . Why ?\nMedia Matters summons the ugliest demons of history to serve its political ends . Instead of making the positive case for their Leftist political views they focus instead on the use of vile tactics to threaten or destroy the lives of others . Somewhere down this road some targeted advertiser \u2014 the next Mark Stevens \u2014 could get seriously hurt . There is not a prayer in the world that I would not stand up and fight this kind of intimidation and fear .\nThis moment is also about CNN \u2014 a network with a legendary and distinguished history \u2014 not simply caving to pressure from an outside group but doing so to a group whose activities launched atrocious threats of physical violence not to mention verbal abuse of women against an advertiser on the most prominent talk radio show in the land . A group led by a man who posted , again per the Daily Caller , \u201c racist , anti-Semitic \u201d and other unspeakable slurs . In sum : Nazi-style behavior . For CNN to simply roll over for people like this is , in my view , a serious , serious mistake .\nYes , this is a tough response . It was tough to write . But in lieu of events , I very much believe it was needed . But\u2026 I want to end on a positive \u2026 and deeply felt note .\nThank you Jeff Zucker and all of CNN for the last two years . And I mean that . These two years of my time with CNN were a seriously momentous time in American politics and history and you , Jeff , personally gave me the privilege of a front row seat . I will be forever grateful . The professionalism , patience , thoughtfulness for my mother \u2014 from you , Jeff , on through the anchors , producers , bookers , behind-the-camera folks and the make-up artists and , God bless them those limo drivers who constantly shuttled me from Central Pennsylvania to CNN \u2019 s doors in Manhattan and Washington \u2014 will never be forgotten . Never . My time with CNN was one of the highlights of my life . On a personal level my friends at CNN will be very much missed . We only part because of a serious but honorable note of disagreement over principle . And I confess , yes , I am so very disappointed . But busy here changing Depends for good old 98-year-old Mom , one learns in life as we all do to put aside disappointment , suck it up \u2014 and move on . As the ancient wisdom goes , never look back .\nMy appearances on CNN became known among other things for historical references , and I think I should close my time there with one last reference that encapsulates the way I viewed my role at CNN and the view from my side of this parting divide over very , very serious principle . It \u2019 s a quote from one of my favorite abolitionists , William Lloyd Garrison , that was printed in 1831 when Garrison published the first edition of his anti-slavery newspaper The Liberator . His words \u2014 reprinted here as they appeared in the original :\nI am in earnest \u2014 I will not equivocate \u2014 I will not excuse \u2014 I will not retreat a single inch \u2014 AND I WILL BE HEARD .\nThanks Jeff for the opportunity to be heard . Thanks in spades to everyone at CNN . I may be bruised here , but I still love you all !",
    "content_original": "\u201cIndefensible.\u201d\n\nWith that one word I was fired from CNN.\n\nWhat did the network find \u201cindefensible\u201d? Two mocking words from a mocking sentence in a two-day old column that appeared in this space in The American Spectator and were repeated on Twitter. After speculating on just how the far-left Media Matters would rewrite the First Amendment, the next line in the column read:\n\nThe American Spectator has been unable to confirm reports that the original draft of this Media Matters revision ended with the words: \u201cSieg Heil!\u201d\n\nFor two days this column, titled \u201cFascist Media Matters Moves to Silence Hannity: Free speech under assault from Soros group\u201d \u2014 a column that went after the goons of the far left Media Matters and their relentless Nazi-style attempt to intimidate the sponsors of television and radio shows featuring conservatives \u2014 sat posted prominently on this very site. My condemnation and mockery of the left-wing group and its tactics \u2014 something I have written about as far back as five years ago \u2014 was in plain sight for all to read. The reaction from CNN? Total silence. Which is as it should be. CNN has every right to decide who is on its air \u2014 no right to edit the works of any of the various writers who ply their trade daily from publications ranging the political gamut from The American Spectator to the New York Times. It was only when I posted those final two mocking words from the column on Twitter that CNN abruptly \u2014 angrily \u2014 reacted.\n\nWhere to start by way of a response? Let\u2019s start with the easiest part and go from there.\n\nI totally disagree that it is \u201cindefensible\u201d \u2014 much less inappropriate \u2014 to mock and condemn either those who use Nazi-style tactics or Nazis, neo-Nazis, white nationalists and white supremacists \u2014 all of which were tragically on display in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend. Mocking and condemning is one of many ways to discredit these despicable human beings and their despicable philosophy. The very idea of treating any of those tactics, groups, or individuals with the kid gloves of a hyperventilating political correctness is itself \u201cindefensible\u201d \u2014 turning a blind eye to the horrific ideas and methods that lie behind them.\n\nThere is a mind-boggling contradiction here. As this is written CNN \u2014 and CNN is far from alone \u2014 is sharply criticizing President Trump\u2019s first statement on the violence from the \u201calt-right\u201d and white supremacists \u2014 Neo-Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan and others \u2014 in Charlottesville. Here\u2019s the headline from the CNN website:\n\nTrump \u2014 once again \u2014 fails to condemn the alt-right, white supremacists\n\nThe story by Dan Merica begins this way:\n\nBridgewater, New Jersey (CNN) President Donald Trump, a man known for his bluntness, was anything but on Saturday, failing to name the white supremacists or alt-right groups at the center of violent protests in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nAs noted, one liberal media outlet after another ran with some version of this story. The point in all of them: the President fails to call out \u201calt-right, white supremacists.\u201d (Eventually the White House put out a second statement saying the President \u201ccondemns all forms of violence, bigotry, and hatred, and of course that includes white supremacists, KKK, neo-Nazi, and all extremist groups.\u201d\n\nBut in fact, when I mocked and condemned exactly a bigoted group like this \u2014 the \u201calt-left\u201d Media Matters and their Nazi/Fascist style tactics, tactics I have previously detailed \u2014 CNN fired me for doing what it was now demanding exactly that the President do. Apparently there are two very different standards for calling out those who use Nazi/fascist style tactics. And to be certain there is no mistake \u2014 the white nationalists and white supremacists, the Klan and all the rest of the bigots who showed up in Charlottesville have no place in the American civil society. Period.\n\nContrary to the CNN idea that mocking and condemning Nazi-style behavior is \u201cindefensible\u201d is the reality that mocking Nazi-like behavior not to mention Nazis themselves has a considerable history in the world of popular American culture. From Charlie Chaplain\u2019s 1940 film The Great Dictator to Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi\u2019s The Blues Brothers to the old CBS comedy Hogan\u2019s Heroes and Mel Brooks\u2019 Springtime for Hitler time and time again the mocking of Nazis or their tactics has become a recurring feature in the American arts. The principle is simple: condemnation by ridicule. Which is exactly what I was doing with that line in my column: condemnation of extremists by using ridicule. And I used much more than ridicule.\n\nWith reason. For a host of obvious horrific reasons, Nazism led eventually to murderous methods used to implement the idea behind it. Nazism and its corollary idea of a state-run media stands alongside Communism as the world\u2019s worst and most evil governing philosophies \u2014 both of which made a point of controlling the flow of information by deciding who did \u2014 and who did not \u2014 get to speak in the mass media of the day. It is politics and journalism as practiced by sadistic gangsters. To ever, at any time, give a pass to those who traffic in either the philosophy or tactics of this garbage is, yes, \u201cindefensible.\u201d\n\nAmong the tools used by Nazis to control the media of the day in Germany was this section from the Constitution of the German Reich, as provided here by the University of South Florida\u2019s A Teachers Guide to the Holocaust:\n\nThus, restrictions on personal liberty, on the right of free expression of opinion, including freedom of the press, on the right of assembly and the right of association, and violations of the privacy of postal, telegraphic, and telephonic communications, and warrants for house-searchers, orders for confiscations as well as restrictions on property, are also permissible beyond the legal limits otherwise prescribed.\n\nTranslated into modern usage by Media Matters this jewel of suppression goes like this, a direct quote provided by the Associated Press from Angelo Carusone, the group\u2019s president, from his latest anti-free speech venture \u2014 this latest one with the goal of driving Fox\u2019s Sean Hannity off the air:\n\nAdvertisers will get burned if they continue to associate with Hannity \u2014 plain and simple.\n\nNote well, CNN. The man said: \u201cAdvertisers will get burned\u2026\u201d\n\nHow exactly do advertisers get \u201cburned\u201d by Media Matters? What does this mean in practice? Why do I feel so strongly about this? Let me give you an example of how this game of \u201cburn the sponsors\u201d is played.\n\nIn 2012, an advertiser targeted in this fashion was Mark Stevens, the founder and CEO of the MSCO marketing firm located in Rye, New York. His sin? Stevens advertised his company, which has nothing to do with politics, on The Rush Limbaugh Show although just in the New York City media market where the company did business. Several years ago Stevens stepped forward to describe what had happened to him as a result. I interviewed him and wrote about it at the time here.\n\nAs Media Matters pressed its \u201cStop Rush\u201d campaign with Limbaugh advertisers in the wake of the Sandra Fluke affair, calls suddenly began pouring into Stevens\u2019 company from across the country \u2014 even though his Limbaugh ads ran only in the New York area \u2014 warning Stevens that he and his company\u2019s \u201cevery move\u201d were now \u201cunder surveillance.\u201d Watch here as Stevens discusses the \u201cinsidious\u201d hatred and vitriol that poured in to his company, a company with a high percentage of female employees, when he refused to bow to pressure \u2014 as CNN has just done in my case \u2014 and pull his ads from the Limbaugh show. There were threats of physical violence, with female employees assailed as \u201csluts.\u201d A company vice president, a 30-year-old woman, was called a \u201cwoman hater.\u201d (Can you say \u201cviolence against women\u201d?) Emails \u2014 tens of thousands of hostile emails that were frequently \u201call the damn same\u201d began arriving from senders calling themselves a \u201cCitizen of the Internet\u201d or \u201cPoliceman of the Internet.\u201d Stevens received threats that busloads of people were coming to his home and he was warned that his personal safety was in danger. \u201cThis is crazy\u201d he told Megyn Kelly.\n\nThis was no boycott, Stevens said. He and his company were the target of an \u201corganized terrorist attack.\u201d He declined to finger Media Matters on air, saying he had no evidence. But he said instead the people he suspected were \u201cthe usual suspects.\u201d\n\nThe usual suspects indeed. Media Matters then \u2014 as now \u2014 was decidedly not shy about claiming credit for the Stop Rush campaign pressuring advertisers to leave Limbaugh\u2019s show. Carusone (in Carusone\u2019s own words) presented himself all over the press with his Stop Rush movement. Carusone said he \u201cstarted talking to (Rush Limbaugh) advertisers on Thursday, and got a lot of feedback on Friday, and I knew a lot of movement was taking place. This was important to think about from a business perspective.\u201d So lovely. Angelo Carusone and Media Matters as a combination of Martin Luther King and Gandhi, yes? All you need is love. Kumbaya.\n\nIn the world of hard reality for those at the receiving end of Media Matters\u2019 tactics? Decidedly not.\n\nI wrote that Stevens, when I interviewed him, was also struck by the thousands of supportive emails and snail mails he received from Americans across the country who had heard his story as told to Fox hosts Stuart Varney (as here) and Megyn Kelly. He was very disturbed about the concerns he read from his supporters. They were, Stevens said, frightened that he had somehow \u201cviolated the rules of a totalitarian society.\u201d As I wrote:\n\nSome (of his supportive) e-mails came from professionals, accompanied by photos of badges or official ID with police forces as far away as Los Angeles. Mark understood. He too had developed this uneasy feeling that standing up in today\u2019s America was \u201clike being an outspoken critic of the government under a totalitarian regime.\u201d He paused. \u201cWe don\u2019t have it yet,\u201d he mused, \u201cbut it\u2019s too much like that.\u201d\n\nTo erase all doubt about the role of Media Matters in these hate-fests, here, again from the AP story just the other day, is this, bold print supplied by me:\n\nMedia Matters for America said Friday it will begin asking Hannity\u2019s advertisers to shun him and will ask thousands of its members to also contact companies. The group is setting up a stophannity.com website and plans to hire a plane to carry an anti-Hannity banner in the New York area.\n\nThis is the front end of a \u201cburning\u201d of advertisers by Media Matters, and what happened to Mark Stevens five years ago when the assault was directed at Rush Limbaugh is the reality of how it manifests itself with threats of physical violence, vitriolic phone calls, and thousands of emails.\n\nTo criticize, condemn, or mock these Nazi-style tactics by calling out the group in question and its leadership by name is \u2014 which as CNN has just demonstrated in my case \u2014 hazardous. Media Matters went to work on CNN using their old and now very well used playbook. As they turned their tactics on Rush Limbaugh and now Hannity, they have just done the same to me. And CNN folded.\n\nTo actually call attention to the flagrantly gangster-style methods of Media Matters is to risk entering the Orwellian world of the Liberal State Media. They are against calling out a group for their tactics \u2014 until they are for it. To protest political gangsterism is to risk being labeled a gangster. Or in my case, condemning and mocking the Nazi-style tactics of Media Matters is to open oneself to being labeled outside the bounds of simple decency if not actually a Nazi. Unless, of course, the President is perceived as not doing it in the Charlottesville episode, in which case CNN and all the rest pile on him for not doing exactly what I did \u2014 and got fired for.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, but there are zero circumstances in which I am going to allow CNN to portray my staunchly and consistent opposition to Nazi-style tactics as somehow a wildly spit-up-on-the-dinner-table totally inappropriate moment worthy of instant banishment from The Most Trusted Name in News. Are you kidding? I do think CNN execs honestly don\u2019t get this \u2014 the liberal media bubble and all of that. But my portrayal by CNN at my firing \u2014 implying that calling out the gangster/Nazi/Fascist style tactics of Media Matters, mocking them, writing yet again about what they are about in terms of shutting down conservatives is such an unreal, \u201cindefensible,\u201d inappropriate, and wildly untrue description of the first magnitude. The term \u201cfake news\u201d comes instantly to mind. No wonder the President of the United States is pissed at his one-time friend.\n\nI have smiled proudly as a CNN commentator at Trump rallies in the face of cries of \u201cCNN sucks.\u201d I never once failed to defend my CNN employer, my CNN colleagues, and my CNN friends. Never\u2026 never once. Only to see that in a blink \u2014 CNN abandoned me because I took on a far left organization that masquerades as some high minded media concern when it consistently employs the kind of tactics CNN is so quick to criticize when coming from some nutty right winger. Worse, CNN abandoned me for doing exactly what mere days later they were demanding the President do \u2014 bluntly name names of those whose tactics are completely off the charts of respectability.\n\nParticularly disturbing is that what just happened with me and CNN is not some sort of stand-alone. As with the Mark Stevens incident, from CNN to Google to college campuses and more, there is a rising tide of intolerance sweeping across major American institutions. All too frequently that intolerance is masked in terms of self-righteous political correctness.\n\nBill Maher, a liberal with whom I disagree on most things and, full disclosure, on whose HBO show I have appeared, is a true soldier of free speech and spoke out in my defense on\u2026 yes!\u2026 CNN in a show with Fareed Zakaria. The headline from Deadline Hollywood:\n\nBill Maher Backs Canned Pundit Jeffrey Lord; Says \u201cThis Has Got To Stop\u201d\n\nIn which Bill says this as reported thusly:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how long I\u2019m going to last, really,\u201d Maher told Zakaria, bemoaning what he sees as today\u2019s political correctness. \u201cIt\u2019s worse every year. The things that they go after people for now. Your colleague \u2014 I don\u2019t agree with him \u2014 Jeffrey Lord, CNN got rid of him because he said sieg heil on a tweet. It was a joke. \u201cThis has got to stop, this idea that people have to go away if they\u2019ve offended me even for one moment. How about just move on, turn the page, go to the next thing in your life?\u201d\n\nExactly.\n\nThere is more to the old-fashioned use of double-standards. As I made the rounds of radio shows from coast-to-coast the day after my firing I was repeatedly asked about CNN\u2019s tolerance for those who, employed by CNN, have used social media or other forums to compare the President of the United States to Adolf Hitler or conservatives to Nazis. I had to confess my ignorance as I was not aware. Over at Fox, Mark Steyn and Pete Hegseth, criticizing CNN for their decision, made the point that \u2014 if one is a liberal \u2014 Nazi references are not only never assailed by CNN as \u201cindefensible\u201d they most assuredly are not followed by a summary firing. They are in fact not even noticed, given a total pass if not being treated as A-OK. I was also asked numerous times if CNN had wanted to get rid of me and merely was cynically using this as an excuse, something that was also said by Rush Limbaugh on his Friday show. I replied that I had no evidence of that.\n\nCNN has put itself in the position of firing me for mocking and condemning Angelo Carusone as the employer of Nazi-style tactics. As noted in my original column from last Tuesday, there was this discovery from the Daily Caller about Carusone during his Stop Rush campaign. The headline:\n\nMedia Matters Executive Wrote Racist, Anti-Semitic, Anti-\u2018Tranny\u2019 Blog Posts\n\nThe story says, in part, this:\n\nA top executive at Media Matters for America and the principal activist in the \u201cStop Rush\u201d campaign made racist and anti-Semitic comments and disparaged \u201ctrannies\u201d on a dormant blog that he wrote just several years prior to his prominent liberal activism career. Blog entries reviewed by The Daily Caller show that Angelo Carusone made derogatory remarks about ethnic groups and used language to insult \u201ctrannies\u201d and ugly \u201cgays\u201d that would be considered hate speech by his own organization. Which is to say, CNN has now put itself in the position of firing me because I used a mocking Nazi salute to a guy who, again, was reported as having written \u201cRacist, Anti-Semitic, Anti-\u2018Tranny\u2019\u201d blog Posts. If I had said my mocking \u201cSieg Heil\u201d to David Duke or Richard Spencer or the other racial, anti-Semitic obsessives tied in with the Klan or Nazis or Neo Nazis, would CNN have cared? Call me skeptical.\n\nI\u2019m sorry. But being fired for standing up against this kind of racist, anti-Semitic, and yes, anti-Transvestite garbage is simply wrong. In fact? It is \u201cindefensible,\u201d not to mention totally inappropriate.\n\nWas there a better way for CNN to handle this? Decidedly yes. If CNN were this upset about what I said in my column, then invite Angelo Carusone and/or Media Matters founder David Brock and myself on to CNN to debate \u2014 to discuss the issue of Media Matters activities in a civilized fashion in a session moderated by a CNN anchor. I\u2019ve met David Brock in the CNN Green Room. The only thing that occurred was a polite handshake, my hand extended first. Instead, the network allowed itself to be bullied into submission by the standard Media Matters assault opening itself to unwanted and decidedly unnecessary criticism as craven, intolerant, and mean spirited. Things that I know from my personal experience at CNN are simply not true.\n\nThere is a larger, albeit subjective and political, concern here as well for the network. CNN tries to position itself as neither Right (like Fox) or Left (as with MSNBC) but rather as the Center \u2014 straight down the middle. But as I took CNN questions from talk radio hosts, the issue of the famous and ongoing battle between President Trump and CNN was repeatedly raised. In fact, it was clear that CNN was seen as not The Center but as an only slightly paler MSNBC \u2014 or sometimes even further to the Left. I was even asked if the White House/CNN clash was not ideological at all but rather nothing more than a high stakes, high visibility personal fight between President Trump and his onetime friend CNN President Jeff Zucker, with the latter cast as some sort of Captain Ahab obsessively attacking his white whale \u2014 the President.\n\nI need to be clear.\n\nI have nothing but wonderful memories of my time at CNN, and many wonderful friendships that blossomed with it. On my end \u2014 in spite of the way some reading this rebuttal will take it \u2014 there is nothing but the greatest respect and affection from me for everyone there from Jeff Zucker on down. I\u2019m just very, very disappointed at CNN\u2019s conduct and with Jeff. In truth, I am incredulous. (I can already hear the President of the United States whispering in my ear: \u201cI told you so.\u201d)\n\nIn fact, I have heard from so many CNNers privately. It is a mark of just how concerning this atmosphere of totalitarian-style repression that is abroad in the land is that I would never thank any of them by name in public for fear that \u2014 simply by guilt of association with me -they too would come under instant attack accompanied by a demand for removal from their job. Or worse, they could be deluged, as was Limbaugh advertiser Mark Stevens, with thousands of hostile emails and threats of physical violence.\n\nIn point of fact Jeff Zucker himself has been targeted for removal in various media accounts for exactly this reason \u2014 having me and other Trumpers on the air at all.\n\nA while back the New York Times Magazine featured Jeff under the title \u201cCNN Had a Problem. Donald Trump Solved It: Inside the strange symbiosis between Jeff Zucker and the president he helped create.\u201d\n\nAfter reading the article I sent Jeff a positive note. A few days later we crossed paths in a CNN newsroom. He thanked me for the note. Sympathetic to the heat he has taken for my presence, I told him: \u201cI\u2019m expendable.\u201d To which Jeff replied with a shrug: \u201cWe\u2019re all expendable.\u201d\n\nSo my moment of expendability has arrived.\n\nThe irony? In one of our first meetings, we were discussing conservative criticism of CNN, specifically by Rush Limbaugh. Jeff asked me of my CNN appearances: \u201cHave you ever been censored?\u201d To which I replied with the absolute truth: \u201cNo.\u201d Alas.\n\nAlas that is no longer true. For mocking bigotry \u2014 directly to a man whose blog posts were discovered to be in the words of that memorable story \u201cracist, anti-Semitic (and) Anti-\u2018Tranny\u2019 and whose organization uses Nazi-style tactics of intimidation and fear against advertisers \u2014 I have not only been censored but summarily fired to please a left-wing lynch mob. A lynch mob that, as Mark Stevens attests, is all too willing to threaten physical violence in service to what Stevens called \u201can organized terrorist action.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t a question of my abrupt dismissal being deeply, offensively wrong \u2014 which it is. Nor is this about the right of CNN to fire anyone it chooses. It most assuredly does have that right. I can understand the Kathy Griffin problem with a bloodied severed head of the President. But I did not understand the dismissal of Reza Aslan, the host of the CNN documentary series Believer. I don\u2019t agree politically with Reza \u2014 we once debated on Don Lemon\u2019s show. But in fact I told Jeff Zucker that if it helped I would be more than happy to speak up for Reza\u2019s right to tweet offensive sentiments of President Trump. They had nothing to do with his show and he seemed to me from both debating him and watching his work that he was a decidedly good person with a sizable body of knowledge about his subject. Exactly the kind of person CNN or any other network should be pleased to host. While assailing the President in such vulgar terms (a piece of excrement etc.) isn\u2019t tasteful, Americans have a long, colorful tradition of using strong and yes, even vulgar language to criticize presidents. My offer to defend Reza was declined.\n\nMy firing by CNN mirrors the Google firing of memo-writer techie James Damore. Damore wrote of his firing in the Wall Street Journal, saying among other things, this \u2014 with bold print supplied by me:\n\nEcho chambers maintain themselves by creating a shared spirit and keeping discussion confined within certain limits. As Noam Chomsky once observed, \u201cThe smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum.\u201d But echo chambers also have to guard against dissent and opposition. Whether it\u2019s in our homes, online or in our workplaces, a consensus is maintained by shaming people into conformity or excommunicating them if they persist in violating taboos. Public shaming serves not only to display the virtue of those doing the shaming but also warns others that the same punishment awaits them if they don\u2019t conform.\n\nIndeed. I have all of a sudden without warning been excommunicated by CNN, as Damore was at Google. In my case it is because I violated a liberal taboo \u2014 Nazi references are OK when applied to supposed \u201cright wingers\u201d but never, ever to \u201cleft-wingers.\u201d\n\nOver at the New York Times, new-columnist arrival Bret Stephens \u2014 an ex-pat Never Trumper from the conservative editorial pages of the Wall Street Journal \u2014 received a whiff of the public shaming treatment dished to the disreputable likes of Damore and myself by Google and CNN when he ventured onto the sacred liberal turf of climate change. As noted by Mark Hemingway in the Weekly Standard:\n\nSince publishing its debut column by Bret Stephens, the New York Times has been under siege by angry readers posting screenshots on social media of them canceling their subscriptions.\u2026 Stephens\u2019s objectionable column \u2014 which is well worth reading \u2014 is about the left\u2019s unhealthy impulse toward blacklisting anyone who doesn\u2019t validate the political and scientific consensus of left-leaning American elites, never mind that we\u2019ve reached a point where precious few people even bother articulating the difference between the two. It\u2019s pretty clear that the attack on Stephens boils down to one thing: He\u2019s a conservative telling liberals what they don\u2019t want to hear, and in this case, need to hear.\n\nI violated the \u201cpolitical \u2026consensus of left-leaning American elites\u201d so, like Damore and that brush-back warning to Bret Stephens, I had to go from CNN when I accused a far-Left group of Nazi-style thuggery and mocked them with that tweeted \u201cSieg Heil.\u201d Do I think for one moment that my CNN colleagues would ever consciously endorse the kind of Nazi-style tactics that attacked a private citizen like Mark Stevens? Not a prayer. But CNN is for whatever reason willfully blind to the reality of the ferocious ideological savageness behind all of this, the kind of ideological savagery that confronted Mark Stevens and who knows how many other advertisers targeted by Media Matters. They see it when it comes from Nazi-style tactics in Charlottesville, but eyes remain closed when it comes from the Left side of the political highway.\n\nBut in reality my firing from CNN has nothing to do with me.\n\nMy firing raises a basic, fundamental question of whether a free press and those who work in that free press \u2014 conservative or liberal or other (and in my case as a television commentator) \u2014 can do their job or even have a robust Twitter back-and-forth with a critic. In yet another irony, earlier this year I attended the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner as a CNN guest. Hanging above the dais was a banner proclaiming in capital letters:\n\nCELEBRATING THE FIRST AMENDMENT\n\nAgain, CNN has the absolute right to hire and fire anyone they choose. But in fact it is closing its eyes to a deliberate, repeated assault by Media Matters on the rights contained in that amendment.\n\nWhat happens when some group out there on the Right copies the tactics of Media Matters? What happens when the target is no longer Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh or Glenn Beck or Bill O\u2019Reilly or me but Anderson Cooper, Don Lemon, Erin Burnett, Wolf Blitzer, Jake Tapper, Brooke Baldwin, Kate Bolduan, John Berman, Poppy Harlow, Chris Cuomo and Alisyn Camerota? In fact, days before I was fired CNN drew criticism from, yes, Media Matters for having me and other supporters of the President on air at all. A shot across the CNN bow.\n\nI was asked post-firing if I was going to apologize. It was noted to me that people in my situation usually and quickly do so. In fact, speaking of Reza Aslan, Reza did just that.\n\nIn my case? Not only is my answer to apologizing \u201cno\u201d \u2014 you can make that \u201chell no!\u201d I joked with reporter Candy Woodall from the Harrisburg Patriot-News and it\u2019s on-line site PennLive site \u2014 that my reply to that question on the very day that I was fired from CNN became Day One of my No Apology Tour. Why?\n\nMedia Matters summons the ugliest demons of history to serve its political ends. Instead of making the positive case for their Leftist political views they focus instead on the use of vile tactics to threaten or destroy the lives of others. Somewhere down this road some targeted advertiser \u2014 the next Mark Stevens \u2014 could get seriously hurt. There is not a prayer in the world that I would not stand up and fight this kind of intimidation and fear.\n\nOne last thing.\n\nThis moment is also about CNN \u2014 a network with a legendary and distinguished history \u2014 not simply caving to pressure from an outside group but doing so to a group whose activities launched atrocious threats of physical violence not to mention verbal abuse of women against an advertiser on the most prominent talk radio show in the land. A group led by a man who posted, again per the Daily Caller, \u201cracist, anti-Semitic\u201d and other unspeakable slurs. In sum: Nazi-style behavior. For CNN to simply roll over for people like this is, in my view, a serious, serious mistake.\n\nSo.\n\nYes, this is a tough response. It was tough to write. But in lieu of events, I very much believe it was needed. But\u2026 I want to end on a positive \u2026 and deeply felt note.\n\nThank you Jeff Zucker and all of CNN for the last two years. And I mean that. These two years of my time with CNN were a seriously momentous time in American politics and history and you, Jeff, personally gave me the privilege of a front row seat. I will be forever grateful. The professionalism, patience, thoughtfulness for my mother \u2014 from you, Jeff, on through the anchors, producers, bookers, behind-the-camera folks and the make-up artists and, God bless them those limo drivers who constantly shuttled me from Central Pennsylvania to CNN\u2019s doors in Manhattan and Washington \u2014 will never be forgotten. Never. My time with CNN was one of the highlights of my life. On a personal level my friends at CNN will be very much missed. We only part because of a serious but honorable note of disagreement over principle. And I confess, yes, I am so very disappointed. But busy here changing Depends for good old 98-year-old Mom, one learns in life as we all do to put aside disappointment, suck it up \u2014 and move on. As the ancient wisdom goes, never look back.\n\nMy appearances on CNN became known among other things for historical references, and I think I should close my time there with one last reference that encapsulates the way I viewed my role at CNN and the view from my side of this parting divide over very, very serious principle. It\u2019s a quote from one of my favorite abolitionists, William Lloyd Garrison, that was printed in 1831 when Garrison published the first edition of his anti-slavery newspaper The Liberator. His words \u2014 reprinted here as they appeared in the original:\n\nI am in earnest \u2014 I will not equivocate \u2014 I will not excuse \u2014 I will not retreat a single inch \u2014 AND I WILL BE HEARD.\n\nThanks Jeff for the opportunity to be heard. Thanks in spades to everyone at CNN. I may be bruised here, but I still love you all!\n\nFarewell.",
