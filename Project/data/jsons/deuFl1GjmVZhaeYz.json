    "content": "Christian writers are incensed with Sen. Ted Cruz , and argue that the Texas senator is putting politics before his fellow religious brethren .\nCruz was the keynote speaker Wednesday evening at a dinner put on by In Defense of Christians , a group dedicated to raising awareness about persecuted Christians in the Middle East . During his speech , the Texas senator argued that Christians have `` no greater ally '' than Israel . Soon after , heckling from the crowd cut off his remarks , and an address that started by emphasizing the unity of Christians ended with shouting and disagreement .\n`` If you will not stand with Israel and the Jews , then I will not stand with you , '' Cruz told the audience as he walked off the stage .\nMuch of his pro-Israel conservative base would have had no problem with these comments , so Cruz may not have expected a backlash . But the response among key Christian thinkers and writers was fierce and immediate .\nCruz was accused of ignorance about the dynamics of Middle Eastern Christianity ; of suggesting that he would not stand with Christians who did n't agree with his political stance on Israel ; even of orchestrating a crass stunt on the backs of persecuted Christians .\n`` Sen. Ted Cruz suggested that holding the same political views on Israel was more important than the fellowship we share as Christians , '' Mollie Hemingway , a senior writer at The Federalist , a conservative website , told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 . `` We should n't fight the global persecution of Christians only if the victims share our political views .
