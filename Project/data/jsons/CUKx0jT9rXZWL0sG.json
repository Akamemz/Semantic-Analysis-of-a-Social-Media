    "content": "In an open letter to Mueller , Robert De Niro writes that Mueller \u2019 s silence has \u201c allowed the administration to use its own voice to control the narrative\u2026 you said that your investigation \u2019 s work \u2018 speaks for itself. \u2019 It doesn \u2019 t . It may speak for itself to lawyers and lawmakers who have the patience and obligation to read through the more than 400 pages of carefully chosen words and nuanced conclusions [ but not to the public ] ... You \u2019 ve characterized the report as your testimony , but you wouldn \u2019 t accept that reason from anyone your office interviewed\u2026 And if , in fact , you have nothing further to say about the investigation , for your public testimony , you could just read from the report\u2026 You are the voice of the Mueller report . Let the country hear that voice. \u201d Robert De Niro , New York Times\nSome note that \u201c confusion persists about Mueller 's labored explanation for why he felt constrained to say \u2014 flat out \u2014 whether Trump committed obstruction . Mueller repeated an analysis that because Justice Department rules prohibit a sitting president from being indicted , it would be \u2018 unfair to potentially accuse somebody of a crime when there can be no court resolution of the actual charge. \u2019 But if fairness is a key consideration , is it fair to leave the president under a cloud of double-negative suspicion ? Among the other questions we 'd like to hear Mueller address : Does he think the nation needs a new process for investigating sitting presidents ? Why was n't Trump subpoenaed to testify in person ? \u201d Editorial Board , USA Today\n\u201c It \u2019 s difficult , of course , not to sympathize with Mueller \u2019 s view that having written this all down clearly in a report and then said it should mean he shouldn \u2019 t have to say it again before Congress\u2026 But that \u2019 s not how the world works . Mueller says it \u2019 s Congress \u2019 s job to determine what should be done , not the DOJ \u2019 s . Congress is political , and fundamentally , you can \u2019 t take the politics out of politics\u2026 media coverage matters\u2026 Live video matters \u2014 and Wednesday \u2019 s statement just drives that home. \u201d Matthew Yglesias , Vox\nRegarding his reluctance to testify in front of Congress , many lament that \u201c Mueller is a man out of time . This is the age of alternatively factual tweets and sound bites ; he \u2019 s a by-the-book throwback who expects Americans to read and absorb carefully worded 400-page reports . Has he met us ? \u201d Ken White , The Atlantic\n\u201c Mueller hardly delivered the resounding closing argument the voting public might have required\u2026 Perhaps the only thing that will break through\u2026 is the sound of Congress stiffening its collective spine after weeks of incoherent claims that the nation is in the grip of a constitutional crisis of unprecedented proportions about which it does not intend to act . With Republican Rep. Justin Amash already there , the question is whether this moves congressional Democrats , who hold the majority , or if they will instead settle for strong feelings about infrastructure. \u201d Dahlia Lithwick , Slate\n\u201c You may note that the subject which the Democrats are claiming they need to investigate further before initiating impeachment\u2014whether Trump committed obstruction of justice\u2014is something that Mueller addressed via a two-year inquiry that culminated in a 448-page report\u2026 One suspects , then , that the issue the party is really interested in is whether public hearings involving Mueller and various obstruction-adjacent ex-administration officials would affect the polls which say that most voters don \u2019 t support impeachment\u2026 In other words , talking about accountability may be the order of the day , but actual accountability is not yet on the table. \u201d Ben Mathis-Lilley , Slate\n\u201c Put it all together and Mueller was saying : Russia interfered in our election . Trump obstructed that investigation . Mueller \u2019 s office could have said Trump didn \u2019 t commit a crime , but did not reach that conclusion . The ball is in Congress \u2019 court . This is as close to a call for Pelosi to begin impeachment proceedings as we are likely to hear from someone as circumspect as Mueller , and it makes Pelosi \u2019 s foot-dragging not just untenable but a dereliction of her constitutional duty. \u201d Richard L. Hasen , Slate\n\u201c The [ Mueller ] report chronicles how Trump fired the FBI director , tried repeatedly to push out other Justice Department officials , tried to shut down the Russia and Flynn probes , tried to fire Mueller , praised witnesses who didn \u2019 t cooperate with Mueller , and attacked a loyalist who did\u2026 [ Mueller said on Wednesday ] that he concluded that he wasn \u2019 t even allowed to consider charging the president with a crime\u2026 [ he also said ] that he doesn \u2019 t have \u2018 confidence \u2019 that Trump \u2018 clearly did not commit a crime. \u2019 So , you know ... connect the dots , I guess ? \u201d Andrew Prokop , Vox\nThe right is critical of Mueller , arguing that his statement was inappropriate and went beyond his role as a prosecutor .\nThe right is critical of Mueller , arguing that his statement was inappropriate and went beyond his role as a prosecutor .\n\u201c Last I heard , a prosecutor \u2019 s job involved determining whether sufficient evidence exists to charge someone with a crime\u2014not whether there \u2019 s sufficient proof of innocence . The insertion of \u2018 not \u2019 in Mueller \u2019 s statement\u2026 turns American jurisprudence completely on its head . \u201d\n\u201c Our system of justice in America is designed to protect the innocent . This is why there are laws that prevent disclosure of grand jury testimony and even more expansive rules at the Justice Department that prohibit prosecutors from disclosing derogatory information about uncharged individuals . It is , in a word , unfair to smear people who have not been charged with anything . Mueller was well aware of this\u2026\n\u201c In the case of a sitting president , wrote Mueller , \u2018 The stigma and opprobrium could imperil the President \u2019 s ability to govern. \u2019 Ironically , the special counsel then proceeded to ignore his own warning . He produced his own \u2018 dossier \u2019 on Trump that was filled with suspicions of wrongdoing\u2026 He refused to make a decision to charge the president in a court of law but was more than willing to indict him in the court of public opinion . \u201d\nMueller \u201c has distorted the critical role of a prosecutor in our justice system\u2026 No responsible prosecutor should ever suggest that the subject of his investigation might indeed be guilty even if there was insufficient evidence or other reasons not to indict . Supporters of Mueller will argue that this is not an ordinary case , that he is not an ordinary prosecutor , and that President Trump is not an ordinary subject of an investigation . They are wrong . The rules should not be any different . \u201d\nMueller offered \u201c an invitation to impeachment . But that \u2019 s not Mueller \u2019 s job . He is a member of the executive branch . He is not an independent counsel . He is not a legislative investigator . A criminal investigation that can not possibly result in charges is a conflict in terms . Mueller never should have agreed to such an investigation under the law , and Mueller \u2019 s own standard makes that clear\u2026\n\u201c In fact , he pulled a James Comey : he effectively indicted Trump for supposed non-crimes publicly , the same way Comey did Hillary Clinton\u2026 It \u2019 s not Mueller \u2019 s job to exonerate anyone . It \u2019 s his job to prosecute or not prosecute . Instead , he told everyone that Trump might be prosecutable , but he couldn \u2019 t really say , but still , there might be impeachment available . \u201d\nMueller \u201c did decide there was insufficient evidence on collusion , so he obviously did not understand the guidance to forbid him from rendering judgments on the sufficiency of the evidence\u2026 [ So he ] can be fairly understood to be saying he believed President Trump committed obstruction of justice\u2026 and , for good measure , he added that in our system it is for Congress to take action against a sitting president . From that premise , the hardline anti-Trump Left will now argue that if Congress does not act , it is shirking its duty and placing the president above the law\u2026 Mueller \u2019 s statement was a boon for pro-impeachment Democrats . \u201d\n\u201c Mr . Mueller would have better served the country and his own reputation if he had simply done what he claimed he wants to do and let his report speak for itself . Instead he has weighed in for the Democrats who want to impeach the President , though he doesn \u2019 t have to be politically accountable as he skips town . This is the core problem with special counsels who think they answer only to themselves . \u201d\nSome argue that \u201c America is fighting over the application of a terribly drafted and overbroad law [ regarding obstruction of justice ] \u2026 Think of the breadth of this interpretation of the law . You can take actions completely within your power as a citizen , employer , or public official and still be prosecuted for them if a prosecutor deems your motivation to be subjectively \u2018 immoral \u2019 or \u2018 wrongful. \u2019 \u2026\n\u201c Two of the three stated grounds for indictment relate directly to the president \u2019 s exercise of his lawful powers \u2014 the alleged effort to fire Mueller and his alleged effort to limit the scope of Mueller \u2019 s investigation\u2026 Trump \u2019 s conduct is scandalous , no question . But so is the law . It places too much power in the hands of prosecutors and the courts , and it gives citizens \u2014 even presidents \u2014 inadequate definitions of prohibited conduct . The raging debates you read today are in part the product of a flaw in the system , a defect in the law that virtually no one will have the energy or interest to change . \u201d",
