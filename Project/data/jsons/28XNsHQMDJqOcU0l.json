Officials say that system stands in sharp contrast to the networks of bases , spies and ground-based technology the U.S. had in place during the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .\nThe U.S. military says airstrikes have been discriminating and effective in disrupting an Al Qaeda cell called the Khorasan Group and in halting the momentum of Islamic State militants . But independent analysts say the Islamic State group , also known as ISIS , remains on the offensive in Iraq and Syria , where it still controls large sections . And according to witnesses , U.S. airstrikes have at times hit empty buildings that were long ago vacated by ISIS fighters .\nThe group has begun adapting to U.S. airstrikes by seeking to conceal itself , move at night and blend in with civilians , Pentagon officials say .\n`` They 're a smart adversary , '' said Air Force Maj. Gen. Jeffrey L. Harrigian , briefing reporters at the Pentagon this week .\nHuman rights groups also claim coalition airstrikes in both countries have killed as many as two dozen civilians . U.S. officials say they ca n't rule out civilian deaths but have n't confirmed any .\n`` We do take extreme caution and care in the conduct of these missions , '' Rear Admiral John Kirby , the Pentagon 's press secretary , told reporters Tuesday . `` But there 's risk in any military operation . There 's a special kind of risk when you do air operations . ''\nIn terms of tracking the movements of militants , U.S. intelligence coverage of Syria and Iraq is not as good as it was in Pakistan and Yemen at the height of covert CIA drone campaigns there , officials say .\nFew if any human spotters are believed to be on the ground assessing the results of U.S. and coalition airstrikes . In Syria , the U.S. is not coordinating the strikes with the main moderate opposition group , the Free Syrian Army , even though it has backed that group with weapons and training , said Andrew Tabler , who follows the conflict for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy .\nThe CIA is generally unwilling to send American intelligence officers into Syria , and partner Arab intelligence services are often focused on their own agendas .
