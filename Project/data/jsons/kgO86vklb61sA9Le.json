Obama famously denied that there \u2019 s a red America and blue America , but it turns out he was wrong . There \u2019 s red America , a sparsely populated but vast landscape of rural and suburban areas , and there \u2019 s blue America , the \u201c urban archipelago \u201d upon which the left \u2019 s constituencies \u2014 single women , minorities , cosmopolitans \u2014 cluster :\nAmong the U.S. intelligentsia , polarization is generally seen as an aberration , a problem to be solved with more civility or centrist third parties or procedural reforms .

The bipartisan era was the aberration :\nThat midcentury era of bipartisanship can be traced almost entirely to America \u2019 s system of racial apartheid .
