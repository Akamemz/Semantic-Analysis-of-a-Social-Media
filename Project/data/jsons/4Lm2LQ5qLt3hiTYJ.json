    "content": "The Department of Justice has joined the campaign against Section 230 , the federal law that enables the internet as we know it . Its effort is probably part of Washington 's ongoing battle against encrypted communications . And legacy news media companies are apparently all to happy to help them in this fight .\nOn Wednesday , the U.S. Department of Justice held a `` public workshop '' on Section 230 . Predictably , it wound being up a greatest hits of the half-truths and paranoid bellyaching commonly employed against this important law .\nSection 230 prevents digital companies from being automatically treated as the speaker of any third-party speech they assist in putting online . It also allows companies to moderate content without becoming liable for it . The law was passed in 1996 to address the fact that the then-dominant web companies felt forced to choose between very strictly gate-keeping or allowing a free-for-all if they wanted to avoid civil lawsuits and criminal liability over user-generated speech .\nSection 230 has never prevented the Justice Department from enforcing federal criminal statutes against online violators , as many have misleadingly argued . ( For a quick debunking of more Section 230 myths , see this video . ) It acts as a shield against civil lawsuits and against state and local criminal charges .\nU.S. Attorney General Bill Barr opened the event yesterday by saying that `` criminals and bad actors now use technology to facilitate and expand the scope of their wrongdoing and the victimization of our fellow citizens . ''\nThis is the same line of talk Barr has used against encrypted communication .\nBarr invoked child exploitation as one \u2588\u2588\u2588 to reexamine Section 230 . But the statute was passed explicitly to address this issue , as part of a larger law concerning `` communication decency '' and online pornography . It provides the legal framework that allows companies to actually try to keep exploitative content offline . And nothing in Section 230 prevents the enforcement of federal laws against child pornography and other forms of sexual exploitation .\n`` Section 230 has never prevented federal criminal prosecution of those who traffic in [ child sexual abuse material ] \u2014as more than 36,000 individuals were between 2004 and 2017 , '' points out Berin Szoka in a post dissecting draft anti\u2013Section 230 legislation proposed by Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R\u2013S.C. ) . Graham 's bill would amend Section 230 to lower the standard for legal liability , so tech companies need n't `` knowingly '' aid in the transmission of illegal content to be found guilty in civil suits and state criminal prosecutions ; they 'd merely have to be deemed to have acted `` recklessly '' in such matters as content moderation or product design . The legislation would also create a presidential commission to offer `` best practices '' on this front . Taken together , Szoka sees this as a back door to banning end-to-end encryption by declaring it reckless . ( More on that bill from First Amendment lawyer Eric Goldman here . )\nBarr 's remarks yesterday did n't explicitly mention giving government backdoors to spy on people . Instead , he played up several popular ( and wrong ) arguments against Section 230 , such as the claim that it 's responsible for `` big tech '' restricting online speech or that it prevents us from having `` safer online spaces . '' Lurking in these comments is the schizophrenic proposition girding a lot of Section 230 opposition : that getting rid of it would somehow permit freer speech online and keep online spaces `` safer '' and more palatable for everyone .\nBarr also engaged in the kind of social media exceptionalism common among Section 230 critics , insisting that online platforms today are so radically different than their predecessors as to warrant different rules . In doing so , he suggested that walled-off internet services like AOL had less control over content than their current counterparts and implied that Section 230 only protects social platforms and `` big tech '' companies .\nIn reality , Section 230 applies to even the smallest companies and groups ( and is more important for ensuring their existence than it is for big companies , whose army of lawyers and moderators have a better chance of weathering a post-230 onslaught of lawsuits from users ) . And it applies to many types of digital entities , including behind-the-scenes web architecture ( such as blogging platforms and email newsletter software ) , consumer review websites , crowdfunding apps , podcast networks , independent message-boards , dating platforms , digital marketing tools , email providers , and many more .\nBarr said Wednesday that the Justice Department was `` not here to advocate for a position . '' Yet everything else in his speech suggested otherwise , including his waxing about how civil lawsuits against tech companies ( of the sort disallowed by Section 230 ) could `` work hand-in-hand with the department 's law enforcement efforts . ''\nHe concluded the talk by saying `` we must remember that the goal of firms is to maximize profit , while the mission of government is to protect American citizens and society . ''\nNot everyone in Washington buys this simplistic argument , thank goodness . In a recent Washington Post op-ed , Sen. Ron Wyden ( D\u2013Ore . ) , who co-authored Section 230 , explains how the law protects individual speech rights and pointed out that major media and tech companies have in fact been working with regulators against the law .\n`` Occasionally , '' writes Wyden , `` Congress actually passes a law that protects the less powerful elements of our society , the insurgents and the disrupters . That 's what it did in 1996 when it passed [ Section 230 ] . '' He explains that the law `` was written to provide legal protection to online platforms so they could take down objectionable material without being dragged into court . ''\n`` Without 230 , social media could n't exist , '' adds Wyden . Neither could movements like Black Lives Matter or # MeToo . `` Whenever laws are passed to put the government in control of speech , the people who get hurt are the least powerful in society . ''\nPeople often pretend government regulation of speech is somehow neutral . But defining permissible speech can change greatly depending on subjective and partisan priorities . Without Section 230 , what online content is permissible and who gets punished would be determined not by an array of private companies but by a centralized political institution with the power to imprison , not just deplatform .\n`` I 'm certain this administration would use power to regulate speech to punish its enemies and protect its allies , '' writes Wyden at the Post . `` It would threaten Facebook or YouTube for taking down white supremacist content . It would label Black Lives Matter activists as purveyors of hate . ''\nA Democratic administration would approve and disfavor different sorts of speech . But we would still have a partisan and centralized command over the bounds of online communication . And either way , the spoils will go to the big tech companies that are best able to lobby , contribute , curry favor , or otherwise game the system .\nPowerful entities like Facebook , Disney , and IBM are all fighting to re-write the rules for digital speech in their favor . A recent New York Times article detailed how the fight against 230 is being led by a coalition of old media companies resentful of Google , Facebook , etc . and other corporations whose business has been bit into by digital tools . For instance , Marriott has been campaigning against Section 230 as a way to stick it to vacation rental platforms like Airbnb .\n`` The easiest lever to hurt tech companies that a lot of people see is 230 , '' Stanford Law School professor Daphne Keller told the Times .\nMike Masnick suggests this illustrates the `` concept of political entrepreneurs v. market entrepreneurs . One of them builds better , more innovative products that increase consumer welfare and increase the overall size of the pie by making things people want . The other uses its enormous power and political connections to pass regulations that hinder competitors who have innovated . ''\nThe companies now opposing Section 230 are `` the legacy companies which have fallen behind , which have not adapted , and which are using their political will to try to suppress and destroy the open systems that the rest of us now depend on , '' Masnick writes .\nOne such example from this week is the News Media Alliance , formerly known as the Newspaper Association of America , which `` represents approximately 2,000 news organizations across the United States and Europe . '' At the Justice Department 's Wednesday workshop , the group 's president , David Chavern , testified that `` Section 230 has created a deeply distorted variable liability marketplace for media . '' This , he said , is bad not just `` for news publishing but for the health of our society . ''\nChavern insisted this was n't merely about news industry profits . But he ended his testimony by endorsing a `` Journalism Competition & Preservation Act , '' which he said `` would allow news publishers to collectively negotiate with the platforms and return value back to professional journalism , '' which\u2026sure makes it sound like this is about news industry profits .\nAnd when entrenched industry profits line up with the feds ' surveillance agenda ?
