''\nThey said the Republican presidential nominee 's suggestion that the Muslim mother of a U.S. soldier who died in Iraq had not \u201c been allowed \u201d to speak at the Democratic National Convention was akin to `` attacking us . ''\nA letter signed by the Gold Star families \u2014 the term for those who have lost loved ones during military service \u2014 also called Trump \u2019 s comments `` repugnant , and personally offensive . ''\n`` When you question a mother 's pain , by implying that her religion , not her grief , kept her from addressing an arena of people , you are attacking us , '' the letter added . `` When you say your job building buildings is akin to our sacrifice , you are attacking our sacrifice . ''\nThe letter was organized by Gold Star Mother Karen Meredith from VoteVets.org , an advocacy group that calls itself non-partisan but which has been described in the past as allied to Congressional Democrats .
