This is the warm-up for 2014 : A purple state , no all-star candidates and plenty of national attention . Republican Ken Cuccinelli had been written off two weeks ago , trailing by double digits , woefully outspent and shackled with an unpopular government shutdown . But as Democrat Terry McAuliffe was brushing up his victory speech , the ObamaCare crash slammed right into his poll numbers . McAuliffe went from prohibitive favorite to flailing frontrunner last week , and closes with a lead down to 6 points in the Real Clear Politics average .\nCuccinelli \u2019 s bumpy road - It \u2019 s never been easy for Ken Cuccinelli . A split that began with the decision by the state Republican Party to hold a nominating convention rather than a primary left Cuccinelli in a lurch . Moderate Republican Lt. Gov . Bill Bolling , who was expected to win if the primary had been held , nearly launched a third-party candidacy in protest . Meanwhile , scandals swirling around Gov . Bob McDonnell denied Cuccinelli the chance to run as successor to the formerly popular social conservative . While dealing with divisions and scandals , Cuccinelli was unable to pounce on the many ethical woes of Democrat Terry McAuliffe . By the time the brutal and costly contest of personal attacks had begun , Cuccinelli was already behind . Democrats and moderate Republicans were preemptively gloating about the demise of the social-issue crusader \u2019 s candidacy\u2026 and then came ObamaCare . The disastrous rollout of the president \u2019 s unpopular health law , against which Cuccinelli had long led the charge , has provided a late-game opportunity for the attorney general . If the race is a low-turnout affair and motivated Republicans can deliver , Cuccinelli could still author what would be a spectacular comeback .\nMcAuliffe the showman - Democrat Terry McAuliffe whose portfolio consists mainly of his career as the top moneyman for the Clinton political machine , came to the race already branded a carpetbagger . ( He did once publicly consider a run for governor of his native New York . ) Backed by megabuck financing and with the help of the Clinton team , McAuliffe set out to defeat his demons : namely scandals connected to his failed stimulus-backed GreenTech car venture and its links to a federal investigation into allegations that the company was running a visa mill . The strategy that proved effective until ObamaCare flopped : massive spending ( a 3-to-1 advantage ) to paint Ken Cuccinelli as a zealot and finance an Obamaesque focus on minorities , youth and women . McAuliffe no doubt hopes the Old Dominion will reverse its long held trend of electing a governor from the opposite party of the current president .\nCampaign Carl Cameron \u2019 s scorecard - Can Ken Cuccinelli pull off a stunning upset ? He needs to do at least two of these three things : 1 ) Blow away turnout models . 2 ) Get enough bounce from appearances by Rand and Ron Paul to undercut Republican-turned-Libertarian , third-party potential spoiler Robert Sarvis . 3 ) Get the equivalent of a referendum vote on ObamaCare , and not the referendum on Tea Party shutdown and women \u2019 s health issues that Dems counter with .\nMisleading robocalls in VA ? - Republican State Delegate Scott Lingamfelter tells the Washington Free Beacon he received a call Sunday night , reportedly from the Democratic Party of Virginia , stating Republican Ken Cuccinelli supported ObamaCare and tax-payer funded abortions .
