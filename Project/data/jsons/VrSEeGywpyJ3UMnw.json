( AP Photo/J . Scott Applewhite )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) \u2014 In a move that supporters said would help working families , the Democratic-controlled House has approved a bill that would make it easier for workers to form unions and bargain for higher wages , better benefits and improved working conditions .\nThe \u201c Protecting the Right to Organize \u201d or PRO Act would allow more workers to conduct organizing campaigns and would add penalties for companies that violate workers \u2019 rights . The act would also weaken \u201c right-to-work \u201d laws that allow employees in more than half the states to avoid participating in or paying dues to unions that represent workers at their places of employment .\nIn one of its most controversial provisions , the bill would close loopholes that allow what supporters call intentional misclassification of workers as supervisors and independent contractors in order to prevent them from joining a union .\nThe House approved the bill , 224-194 , on Thursday . The measure is unlikely to be taken up in the Republican-controlled Senate and faces a veto threat from the White House .\nEven so , Democrats touted it as a major victory for worker rights and said it would help reverse a decades-long trend of declining union membership in the U.S. workforce . Less than 11 % of American workers belong to a union , a statistic Democrats called disgraceful .\n\u201c Without these protections , the playing field will remain heavily stacked against workers , \u2033 said Rep. Mark Pocan , D-Wis .\nThe bill \u2019 s sponsor , Rep. Bobby Scott , D-Va. , called labor unions one of the most powerful tools workers have to improve their standard of living . But under current law , there are \u201c no meaningful penalties for predatory corporations that use unlawful tactics to discourage workers from organizing a union , \u201d said Scott , who chairs the House Education & Labor Committee .\n\u201c For far too long , workers have been stripped of their voices , losing their power to organize for better wages and benefits , \u2033 said Pocan , co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus . The House bill will allow workers to \u201c fight back against corporations and anti-union special interests that have attacked and eroded the labor movement for decades , \u2033 he said .\nRepublicans dismissed the bill as a \u201c political gift to union bosses \u201d that would diminish the rights of workers and employers alike while harming the economy .\n\u201c Big Labor is in a panic over plummeting union membership , \u2033 said Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina , the senior Republicans on the labor panel . She urged union leaders to \u201c self-correct and increase transparency and accountability , \u2033 rather than spending \u201d three times as much money on political activity as on ... organizing and representing workers.\u2033\nFederal law already protects the right of employees to organize , Foxx said , adding that the House bill would require employers to hand over workers \u2019 personal information to union organizers , allowing them to \u201c target , harass and intimidate workers.\u2033\nIf the House bill becomes law , \u201c workers will be forced to take money from their paychecks and give it to labor unions even if they don \u2019 t want to be represented by a union , \u2033 she said , noting that the bill is opposed by small business owners , trade associations and other business organizations .\nThe White House also objected to the bill . While the Trump administration is willing to work with Congress to strengthen protections for union members , the House bill would kill jobs , violate workers \u2019 privacy , restrict freedom of association and roll back the administration \u2019 s deregulatory agenda , the White House said in a statement .\nThe Democratic bill \u201c appears to cut and paste \u201d core provisions of a controversial California law that \u201c severely restricts self-employment , \u2033 the White House said . The California law , known as Assembly Bill 5 , \u201c is actively threatening the existence of both the franchise business sector and the gig economy in California , \u2033 the White House said , adding that it \u201d would be a serious mistake for Congress to impose this flawed job-killing policy on the entire country.\u2033\nThe California law has drawn nationwide attention for its attempt to give wage and benefit protections to people who work for ride-share companies such as Uber and Lyft . The law also applies to freelance journalists , despite complaints that it could put some out of work .\nUnder the PRO Act , employers would not be allowed to force workers to attend anti-union meetings and would face penalties for violating workers \u2019 rights .\n\u201c It \u2019 s time to give workers the tools they need to survive in an economy rigged against them , \u2033 Pocan said . \u201c Every worker deserves to have a union.\u2033",
