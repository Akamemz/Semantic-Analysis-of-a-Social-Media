Last year, many economic analysts were nervously predicting a recession on the horizon. Today, the economy is looking stronger by the day.

His standing in key swing states is even lower.\n\n\n\nIn this context, former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign message \u2013 casting the Trump presidency as \u201can aberrant moment\u201d in the nation\u2019s history \u2013 may be a shrewd move. Unlike many of his Democratic rivals, Mr. Biden is not running on the notion that the country has deep, systemic problems in need of dramatic overhaul.
