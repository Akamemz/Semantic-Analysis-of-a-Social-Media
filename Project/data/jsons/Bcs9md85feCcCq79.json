Like the claim that America 's relatively slow growth rate in recent years is a product of our tax burden ( when in fact tax rates were considerably higher during the high-growth decades following World War II ) . Or the related contention that taxes can be drastically cut without massively increasing the budget deficit because the cuts will spur such enormous growth that tax revenues will actually increase . Or the endlessly repeated alliterative vow that ObamaCare will be `` repealed and replaced , '' while neglecting to admit , let alone defend , the fact that the replacements favored by the GOP candidates would almost certainly leave millions of those currently covered by the Affordable Care Act without insurance .\nActually , that 's more than enough to leave me pretty disgusted .\nAnd yet , at Tuesday 's debate , there were so many other things that got me going more than usual . I 'm talking about specific policy proposals that amounted to nothing more than transparent nonsense . Maybe a credulous viewer with no knowledge of history , public policy , economics , or how the government actually works could respond to these proposals with a nod and a cheer .

It 's insulting to be treated like a sucker , a chump . And yet , my conservative intellectual friends appear not to be bothered in the least .\nHere are three concrete examples from Tuesday 's debate of Republican candidates doing their best PT Barnum imitation .\n1 . More than once in the debate , Carly Fiorina proposed reducing the federal tax code \u2014 not the forms ordinary citizens use to file their taxes , but the body of laws that govern taxation in the United States \u2014 to three pages . From its current length of more than 74,000 pages .

I 'm sure it could be ! Maybe we could go back to its length in 1984 ( 26,300 pages ) . Or even to its size at the end of World War II ( 8,200 pages ) , when the population stood at 140 million people and the economy was many times smaller and vastly less complex than it is now . But no : Fiorina wants us to believe the code can be shrunk to three pages . Which is obviously , indisputably , offensively ludicrous . How can conservative intellectuals be anything but outraged by such hucksterism ?\n2 . Ted Cruz took the usual supply-side happy-talk about tax cuts producing massive economic benefits to new , unusually concrete levels , claiming that instituting a 10 percent flat personal income tax and a 16 percent value-added tax , and eliminating the payroll tax , the `` death tax , '' the corporate income tax , and the IRS , and the departments of Commerce , Energy , and Housing and Urban Development , would lead `` every income group '' to `` see double-digit increases\u2026of at least 14 percent . ''\nFourteen percent increases in what ? Cruz provided an example that indicated he meant a 14 percent increase in income : `` So if you 're a single mom , if you 're making $ 40,000 a year , what that means is an extra about $ 5,000 in your pocket\u2026 '' ( A 14 percent raise on $ 40,000 in income amounts to an additional $ 5,600 a year . )\nThe evidence for this assertion can be found in a report prepared by the Tax Foundation , a Washington think tank that , among other things , scores the tax plans of Republican presidential candidates . In the report , readers will find the claim that `` the economic growth that the plan would produce '' through `` increased incentives to work and invest , '' as well as from `` a significant reduction in the service price of capital , '' would lead every income level ( including that of a single mom earning $ 40,000 a year ) to enjoy an increase in after-tax income of `` at least 14.2 percent over the long term , '' with the `` long term '' defined as `` over the next 10 years . '' ( The top one percent , incidentally , would enjoy a 34.2 percent income boost in that same time period . )\nMeaning : If you make a series of highly questionable supply-side assumptions and extrapolate out for 10 years from the first year of a Cruz administration in which Congress passes his radical tax plan in every particular , a single mom currently earning $ 40,000 in after-tax income will be earning $ 45,600 round about 2027 .\n3 .
