    "title": "CAN NEIL GORSUCH DE-POLITICIZE THE SUPREME COURT?",

    "authors": "Cond\u00e9 Nast, Scott Turo, Vanessa Grigoriadis, Eric Lutz, Alison Durkee",
    "content": "The nomination of federal Appellate Court Judge Neil Gorsuch to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court is destined to speed up the already rapid politicization of the court , a process that threatens to rob it of legitimacy and , sooner or later , produce open defiance of its decisions . This has next to nothing to do with the bona fides of Judge Gorsuch , who appears to have the intellectual qualifications\u2014a doctorate from Oxford , no less\u2014and the judicial experience that one , in theory , would want in a Supreme Court justice .\nThe problem , of course , is the way we got here . Even before Barack Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland to succeed Justice Scalia last year , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to allow hearings to proceed on any name that the president sent forth . Instead , McConnell said , the nomination should belong to the next president chosen by the American people . There was virtually no precedent for McConnell \u2019 s position : Justice Anthony Kennedy was confirmed in the last year of President Reagan \u2019 s second term by a Democratic Senate . Worse , by essentially proposing that the choice for a Supreme Court justice would be decided as the result of a plebiscite , McConnell was suggesting that the court should be controlled by the voters .\nMcConnell \u2019 s actions were all the more ironic because they concerned the seat of the court \u2019 s most committed \u201c originalist , \u201d as those who supposedly interpret the Constitution according to the intent and understandings of its framers are called . In this case , the intent of the framers was pretty clear on a couple of matters . First , Article II , Section 2 of the Constitution says : \u201c The President ... shall nominate , and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate , shall appoint ... Judges of the [ S ] upreme Court ... \u201d Lawyers , including originalists , love \u201c plain language , \u201d and the plain language here vests the appointment power solely in the president , with the Senate \u2019 s role limited to advising and consenting . By withholding any vote in committee or on the Senate floor , McConnell clearly ignored the constitutional command to offer advice or affirmation .\nFurthermore , by awaiting the next presidential election , McConnell was saying that the voters deserved to decide the direction of the court . Again , this is not what the framers of the constitution wanted . They could have easily provided for the election of judges . They didn \u2019 t . The framers envisioned the court as a less political institution on which the justices would serve for life , so that they were not prisoners of the popular will .\nIt goes without saying that McConnell \u2019 s actions , while the most recent and most radical step in politicizing the court , were hardly the first . Conservatives like to say , with some merit , that all of this began when the Democrat-controlled Senate refused to confirm Robert Bork , President Reagan \u2019 s first nominee for the seat that Kennedy eventually filled . Bork , who had the same kind of intellectual credentials and experience as Gorsuch , had tarnished himself for good during Watergate . As acting attorney general , he had followed President Nixon \u2019 s order to fire the independent special prosecutor , Archibald Cox , but only after Attorney General Eliot Richardson and his replacement , Deputy Attorney General William Ruckleshaus , had both resigned rather than fire Cox themselves . ( Sound familiar ? ) Being \u201c Borked , \u201d in the conservative lexicon , soon became a synonym for being derailed only because of one \u2019 s political leanings . That said , it \u2019 s worth wondering where we would be today if the Democrats in the Senate in 1987 had had McConnell \u2019 s gall and guile and simply refused to bring Bork \u2019 s nomination to a vote because Reagan was a lame duck .",
