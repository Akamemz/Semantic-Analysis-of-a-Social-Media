CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper warned: \u201cI don\u2019t think moderate Republicans are doing enough to hold President Trump accountable for his rhetoric.\u201d NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd noted supposed parallels to the killer\u2019s rhetoric, and asked: \u201cWhen the president uses the term \u2018invaders,\u2019 does that dehumanize to the point where it can get misused?\u201d\n\nThe media made Mr. Trump its singular target, but not even Democrats were completely spared from the frenzy of critical reactions. In a viral video, an angry NYU student confronted Chelsea Clinton and blamed her \u201crhetoric\u201d for the New Zealand massacre. What was Ms. Clinton\u2019s offense? She criticized Rep. Ilhan Omar, Minnesota Democrat, for making anti-Semitic remarks.\n\nBlaming Mr. Trump or even Chelsea Clinton is nonsensical. The media acts like mass public shootings in other countries are something new, but they are actually much more common outside of the United States. And, well before Mr. Trump became president, foreign shooting, bombing and vehicle attacks were increasing in frequency at a much faster rate.\n\nResearch by the Crime Prevention Research Center, over which I preside, shows that there were 2,354 attacks and at least 4,880 shooters outside of the United States from 1998 through 2015.
