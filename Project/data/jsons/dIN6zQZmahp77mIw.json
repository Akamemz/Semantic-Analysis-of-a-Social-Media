    "content": "Reade , who has alleged Joe Biden assaulted her in 1993 , believes the media is applying a double standard to her story and Democrats aren \u2019 t taking her seriously .\nMax Whittaker / The New York Times via Redux Tara Reade , a former aide to Joe Biden , April 11 .\nShe has seen Joe Biden take questions on cable news and late-night television . She has seen him host virtual town halls with voters and online fundraisers with donors . And from her home in California , where she is keeping a daily watch on Twitter , Tara Reade has been waiting for someone \u2014 anyone \u2014 to ask the former vice president about her story . \u201c He was on television twice today . No one asked him . No one \u2019 s asking the question , \u201d Reade said in a phone interview earlier this month . \u201c No one \u2019 s even posing the question. \u201d On that particular day , Biden sat for an interview with Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski on MSNBC \u2019 s Morning Joe , appeared on a CNN coronavirus town hall with Anderson Cooper , and took questions during a 45-minute fundraiser with dozens of donors . More than a month after Reade first detailed a serious allegation of sexual assault , Biden is set to address the subject in a Morning Joe interview scheduled for Friday morning . For weeks , he didn \u2019 t receive a question about the claims , despite doing multiple interviews . Reade , who has fielded dozens of requests from reporters this month , said she is acutely aware that her allegations pose complex terrain for the \u201c mainstream media \u2019 s \u201d coverage of a Democratic Party that has long viewed both Biden as a beloved figure and President Donald Trump as a man accused of sexism and more than a dozen instances of sexual harassment and assault . As Democrats came to Biden \u2019 s defense this month as an advocate for women \u2014 marking a turn for a party that has embraced the notion of \u201c believing women \u201d as a baseline posture in the # MeToo era \u2014 Reade said she believes her story has been given short shrift compared to other accusations of sexual abuse against powerful figures . She named as an example Christine Blasey Ford , the woman who said she was sexually assaulted by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh , then Trump \u2019 s nominee to the court . After seeing her story refracted through the lens of Political Twitter , Reade said in a series of interviews this month she \u2019 s felt \u201c marginalized , \u201d \u201c smeared , \u201d and \u201c discounted \u201d \u2014 betrayed by Democrats she said she once admired . \u201c It was really devastating when [ Kirsten ] Gillibrand and Stacey Abrams and Hillary Clinton , all on the same day , just basically implied my story was n't true and they believe Joe Biden . I can \u2019 t describe to you what that felt like , \u201d Reade said on Thursday , describing herself as a \u201c lifelong Democrat \u201d and in particular a fan of Abrams ' , the former Georgia House minority leader who has been campaigning to serve on the ticket with Biden as his vice presidential nominee . \u201c I just\u2014 I \u2019 m stunned , \u201d Reade said . \u201c They did n't just say , \u2018 Oh , we 're standing with Joe Biden until we hear more. \u2019 They just discounted me . They marginalized me . They said they did n't believe me . I ca n't tell you , \u201d Reade said , trailing off . \u201c I cried for a while because they 're important in my life . They 've been figures that I looked up to . \u201d\nAt points over the last month , Reade has been scrutinized as much as her allegations . Some Democrats have pointed to her pro\u2013Bernie Sanders tweets ( \u201c Bernie stay in ! \u201d she tweeted in late March ) , her writings praising Vladimir Putin ( she told \u2588\u2588\u2588 earlier this month that she had changed her views about Putin after reading writers like Julia Ioffe and Russian opposition activist Alexei Navalny ) , and her decision to first seek a platform for her story on left-wing media outlets like Katie Halper \u2019 s podcast ( \u201c She 's very trauma-informed , \u201d she says of Halper ) as markers of her credibility . Reade , a 56-year-old who says she put herself through law school as a single mother and still has hundreds of thousands of dollars in student and medical debt , says she is not ashamed to identify herself as \u201c a working-class poor person. \u201d She has followed the online discussion , political and academic , over the ways in which survivors are received in the public square . \u201c I am not an \u2018 imperfect victim , \u2019 \u201d Reade tweeted on Tuesday . Reade has accused Biden of digitally penetrating her in a Senate hallway when she was a staff assistant in his Senate office in 1993 . She has said she filed a Senate personnel report at the time , told others in the office about the incident , and was removed from her duty of overseeing the interns . The Biden campaign has said the incident did not happen . Three former Senate aides , all of whom Reade said she complained to directly at the time about the assault , have said they don \u2019 t remember any such complaint or that it did not take place . One of them , Biden \u2019 s former executive assistant from 1982 to 2000 , Marianne Baker , said in a statement provided by the campaign that she never once witnessed or heard of \u201c any reports of inappropriate conduct , period \u2014 not from Ms. Reade , not from anyone. \u201d Subsequent reporting has corroborated elements of Reade \u2019 s story . Former interns from the Senate office remember Reade being reassigned away from managing them , according to the New York Times . After Reade mentioned that her mother had called into Larry King Live , the Intercept published the transcript from a 1993 episode where a caller described her daughter \u2019 s negative experience with a \u201c prominent senator , \u201d though the caller does not detail the nature of the experience . Across different outlets , people who knew Reade have said she told them that she had had a bad experience with her boss in Washington \u2014 with varied levels of detail . In an interview with Business Insider , a former neighbor , Lynda LaCasse , said Reade detailed her full allegation against Biden in the 1990s . The New York Times and Washington Post each reported they spoke with an unnamed friend who had said Reade told her about the allegation in the 1990s as well . Others have provided more limited accounts \u2014 one friend told the Washington Post , for instance , that she remembered Reade saying Biden touched her arm and behaved inappropriately , but did not have other details . Reade \u2019 s brother initially told the Post he remembered her telling him that Biden was \u201c inappropriate , \u201d but followed up days later to clarify that he recalled Reade telling him that the then-senator had put his hands under her clothes . Through it all , Biden himself has remained silent . Publicly , aides have referred reporters back to a single statement , dated April 13 , saying that while the former vice president believes women should have the space to tell their stories , this incident didn \u2019 t occur . Privately , they have distributed talking points to other Democrats advising them to rely on a New York Times investigation and to ( inaccurately ) insist the article concluded the incident never happened . Though the mainstream media has now started to aggressively cover the story , Reade has been disappointed with the length of time it took major news outlets to cover her allegation , as well as the tone of some of the coverage . Last year \u2014 when other women had come forward to say Biden had touched them in a way that made them uncomfortable \u2014 Reade told her local paper that while working for the former senator , he touched her neck and shoulders . In the same 2019 column , she said a supervisor told her that Biden wanted her to serve drinks at an event because he liked the way she looked . When she refused , Reade told the newspaper , her responsibilities were reduced . This spring , she turned to leftist outlets to tell her serious allegation of sexual assault by Biden , appearing on Halper \u2019 s podcast and Democracy Now . \u201c I used to think that a Republican talking point was to call the mainstream media biased , \u201d Reade said . \u201c So I used to think , Oh , that 's just a talking point for them . I do n't believe it . But now I 'm living it [ in ] real time , and I see it \u2014 like , I see it for what it is . Because I am a Democrat , or I was . But now I 'm not anything , really . I \u2019 m politically homeless . \u201d",
