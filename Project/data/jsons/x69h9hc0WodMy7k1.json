    "content": "For a few glorious weeks this summer , Fox News seemed as if it had emerged from a retrograde stupor defined , in part , by \u201c leg cams , \u201d the cinematic technique predicated on shooting broadcasters at thigh level , in favor of a period of enlightenment . After former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson filed a sexual-harassment lawsuit against the network \u2019 s co-founder , Roger Ailes , numerous other women came forward with surprising velocity to voice their own allegations . Meanwhile , James Murdoch , the C.E.O . of 21st Century Fox , and his brother , Lachlan Murdoch , its executive chairman , swiftly ordered an aggressive internal investigation to be administered by the white-shoe law firm Paul , Weiss . As I have previously reported , many within Fox News \u2019 s subterranean newsroom credited the younger Murdochs , still ubiquitously known as \u201c the Boys , \u201d for handling the crisis so expeditiously , and for pledging to sanitize Fox News \u2019 s culture . Ailes once said that the company was prepared to broadcast until the end of time , meaning up until the critical moment of a potential apocalypse or world war . In less than two weeks , however , he was out . The wooden door that famously cordoned his office suite from prying eyes was removed . Within , two handguns were discovered\u2014one a Glock , the other a Smith & Wesson\u2014with ammunition for both . ( \u201c Roger has a permit for those two guns , \u201d Ailes \u2019 s attorney , Susan Estrich , told me , adding that her client has a license to carry a handgun in New York , \u201c for his personal protection. \u201d She continued : \u201c Those guns are licensed and appropriate. \u201d Ailes has repeatedly denied all allegations of sexual harassment . )\nWithin the newsroom , according to one staffer , the days following Ailes \u2019 s departure were defined by \u201c shock and awe. \u201d But as Rupert Murdoch moved in to take over as interim C.E.O. , it seemed like the big boss was working in tandem with his heirs . The Murdochs tried to extract some of Ailes \u2019 s associates . The company announced that former Fox News C.F.O . Mark Kranz was retiring . Some of Ailes \u2019 s closest allies were also dismissed . His so-called black ops team left Fox . Several of his former assistants followed .\nAs reporters and producers grew accustomed to the sweeping changes , however , the Murdochs did something seemingly peculiar : they elevated Ailes \u2019 s closest deputy , Bill Shine , and a Fox Television Stations executive , Jack Abernethy , to co-presidents of Fox News . They also kept on Dianne Brandi , the general counsel , and Suzanne Scott , \u200eexecutive vice president , programming and development . These moves seemed counter-intuitive to those who saw the younger Murdochs agitating for change . Not only had Shine and Brandi been influential deputies in the Ailes regime , but they were also reportedly implicated in the allegations of Laurie Luhn , the former Fox booker , who accused Ailes of sexual harassment and psychological torture .
