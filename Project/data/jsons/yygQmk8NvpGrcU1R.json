    "content": "President Barack Obama is expected to endorse changes to the way the government collects millions of Americans ' phone records for possible future surveillance , but he 'll leave many of the specific adjustments for Congress to sort out , according to three U.S. officials familiar with the White House intelligence review .\nThat move would thrust much of the decision-making on Section 215 of the USA Patriot Act toward a branch of government that is deeply divided over the future of the surveillance apparatus and in no hurry to settle their differences and quickly enact broad changes . Among the key decisions Obama is expected to leave to Congress is whether the National Security Agency should continue hold the trove of phone records or move the data to the phone companies or another third party .\nIn a highly anticipated speech Friday , Obama is also expected to announce broader oversight of the process that helps determine which foreign leaders the U.S. government monitors . And he 's likely to back increased privacy protections for foreign citizens , a step aimed at soothing international anger over U.S. surveillance programs .\nThe speech marks the culmination of a monthslong review sparked by former NSA systems analyst Edward Snowden , who leaked a trove of classified documents about the secret surveillance programs last year .\nIn another revelation about NSA activities , The New York Times reported Tuesday that the agency has implanted software in nearly 100,000 computers around the world -- but not in the United States -- that allows the U.S. to conduct surveillance on those machines .\nThe NSA calls the effort an `` active defense '' and has used the technology to monitor units of China 's Army , the Russian military , drug cartels , trade institutions inside the European Union , and sometime U.S. partners against terrorism like Saudi Arabia , India and Pakistan , the Times reported .\nWhite House officials on Tuesday cautioned that the review Obama has been conducting is not complete and that the president could make additional decisions in the coming days . Obama is reviewing more than 40 recommendations from a presidential commission .\nThe U.S. judiciary threw cold water on one proposal Obama has indicated he supports : putting an independent privacy advocate on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court , which currently hears only from the government . Speaking for the entire judiciary , U.S. District Judge John D. Bates said Tuesday that appointing an independent advocate to the secret court is unnecessary and possibly counterproductive .\nOfficials familiar with the White House review say the panel 's recommendation to strip the NSA of its authority to hold Americans ' phone records has proven difficult for Obama .

But officials say he is unlikely to announce specific entities he believes should hold the records in the future , in part because telephone companies have balked at the proposal to bring the data back under their control .
