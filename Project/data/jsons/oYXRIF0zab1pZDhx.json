So it mostly kept quiet despite intense lobbying from fellow Democrats to say more before the voting .\nThat decision continues to be hotly debated months later now that the FBI has acknowledged it is investigating whether Trump or his team colluded with the Russians , and Monaco \u2019 s comments amount to the most extensive on-the-record description yet about the Obama White House \u2019 s internal thinking as it struggled to come up with a proper response to what it would eventually characterize as \u201c unprecedented \u201d foreign interference in a U.S. election .\n\u201c There has been this theory we didn \u2019 t do anything , which I take issue with , \u201d Monaco says in the interview , describing a decision by the administration\u2014despite the extraordinary nature of a series of cyberattacks targeting the American political process itself\u2014to treat the Russian intervention using the same law enforcement-focused approach it had in previous major hacks by \u201c malicious \u201d state actors .\nThe comments by Monaco , a longtime Justice Department official who rose to become Republican-appointed director Robert Mueller \u2019 s chief of staff at the FBI before moving into senior roles in the Obama administration , came in a wide-ranging interview that focused on the sharp policy shifts Trump has promised on the issues she helped oversee in the Obama White House , from the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria to the vetting of refugees .\nObama came into office promising to roll back what Democrats saw as the excesses of the Bush years and put in place a more sustainable approach to fighting terrorism . And Monaco , who helped lead those efforts , acknowledges that Trump may well undo much of that Obama legacy . \u201c In this area , so much of this is by executive order , so there is no constraint , \u201d she says . \u201c It can go with the stroke of a pen , as we \u2019 re seeing . \u201d\nBut as Russiagate has ballooned into a full-scale Washington scandal engulfing the Trump White House , with congressional and law-enforcement investigations and multiple emerging new plotlines , the conversation with Monaco , a cautious former prosecutor who refused to discuss any of the underlying evidence in the unfolding Russia case and retains a tone of lawyerly discretion even when describing the policy struggles of the Obama White House , is a reminder of just how much the Russia story has come to overshadow almost everything else .\nWhen a trove of hacked Democratic National Committee emails came out in July 2016 , the Obama administration reacted as it had to past cyberattacks\u2014despite the extraordinary political nature of the intrusion .\n\u201c We treated it very much in the way that we have done other malicious activity by cyber actors , \u201d Monaco says , choosing to turn the case over to the FBI and intelligence agencies to figure out how and when to \u201c attribute \u201d the attack publicly without giving away the evidence used to reach that conclusion . \u201c We applied the same framework that we have in other contexts , whether it was China stealing intellectual property , whether it \u2019 s Iran committing denial of service attacks on our financial institutions , whether it \u2019 s North Korea in the Sony attack , \u201d Monaco says . \u201c We applied a framework and a playbook that we have done many times . \u201d\nBut strong supporters of Clinton \u2019 s campaign argued\u2014some at the time , many more in the wake of the former secretary of state \u2019 s shocking November election defeat\u2014that the Obama team should have done more to publicize the hacking for what it was : a heavy-handed Kremlin intervention on behalf of one side in America \u2019 s presidential election . Monaco pushed back against that , recalling that the heads of U.S. intelligence agencies issued a joint statement publicly blaming the Russians for the pre-election hack on Oct. 7 . \u201c That was an unprecedented statement , \u201d she says , \u201c a fact that sometimes gets lost in this discussion \u201d given that it came on the same day as the revelation of the \u201c Access Hollywood \u201d tape showing Trump joking about sexually assaulting a woman .\nBut Monaco confirmed in the interview that top White House officials privately objected to a strong statement from Rep. Adam Schiff and Sen. Dianne Feinstein , the two top Democrats on the congressional intelligence committees , in September that said Russia was specifically targeting the U.S. elections ; they did so , she said , because the statement was \u201c not bipartisan . \u201d\nMonaco says that \u2019 s because the Obama administration was at the time focused on seeking cooperation for a last-ditch effort by the Department of Homeland Security to avoid Russian tampering in the actual voting process . But the administration , she said , faced a backlash from state and local governments who viewed the DHS cybersecurity election push as \u201c a big federal takeover \u201d and were reluctant to cooperate . That was the case that she , FBI Director James Comey and DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson made in a secret briefing of top members of Congress in the fall , during a session at which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) reportedly balked at their characterization of the evidence of Russian involvement in the hack .\n\u201c Our focus was really to make sure that the election process was not undermined , because here \u2019 s the thing : Whatever else was a subject of debate about motive , we knew , and everyone agreed , that one of the goals that Russia had in all of this was to undermine confidence in our democratic process , to sow discord , to sow confusion , \u201d she says . \u201c And so , we were very conscious that we not do their work for them by creating a partisan discussion about this . So , the Schiff and Feinstein statement , I think , one of the concerns was that it was not bipartisan . \u201d\nWhy , then , I asked her a couple of times , did Comey seem to take a less than bipartisan approach in communicating publicly about the probes of Clinton \u2019 s private email server , which ended with no charges , while refusing even to acknowledge the ongoing investigation of Trump \u2019 s campaign and its Russia ties ? Had he tarnished the ability of U.S. law-enforcement agencies to act independently ?\n\u201c I think that \u2019 s regrettable , \u201d Monaco says , \u201c because I don \u2019 t think Comey is a partisan actor. \u201d Justice Department investigations , she adds , \u201c should be completely walled off from partisan political considerations and White House interference. \u201d So , \u201c to the extent that the events over the last year have tarnished that in any way , I think that \u2019 s really regrettable . \u201d\nAs for Trump \u2019 s recent tweet charging that Obama had \u201c wire tapped \u201d him amid the campaign and swirling Russia allegations , Monaco had a flat \u201c no \u201d for an answer . Comey and others , she says , have \u201c debunked \u201d it and testified to the \u201c ludicrousness of that accusation . \u201d\nAs Obama \u2019 s top homeland security adviser , Monaco was in charge of helping to drive many of the policies President Trump has said he will reverse or re-engineer , vowing , for example , a stepped-up war on what he calls \u201c radical Islamic terrorism \u201d and more \u201c extreme vetting \u201d of people from six majority-Muslim countries subject to a temporary ban on admission to the United States in his now-contested executive order .\nMonaco , who says she was nicknamed \u201c Dr . Doom \u201d by the former president ( because every time Obama \u201c saw me coming he knew something bad had happened \u201d ) , acknowledges that while Trump can undo many of Obama \u2019 s counterterrorism policies \u201c with the stroke of a pen , \u201d she hopes that much of the rules-based framework he tried to create for fighting terrorism will nonetheless survive .\nOn style as well as substance , Monaco describes a White House that couldn \u2019 t have been more different from its drama-heavy successor . Life in the Obama White House as she describes it working in her windowless \u201c cave \u201d in the West Wing was process-intensive and at times even painstakingly deliberative , with a boss who did all the homework and cared deeply about even minor details she presented him in the Situation Room . Obama , she tells me , was \u201c a voracious consumer of written information \u201d who made showing up at the presidential daily brief \u201c like appearing before a tough judge every day . \u201d\nMonaco acknowledges , however , that Obama did not deliver on several key campaign pledges connected with the terrorism fight , such as closing the prison in Guantanamo Bay and trying in court those accused of a role in the 9/11 plot , and she called it \u201c tremendously troubling and heartbreaking , I suspect , for many of the families of the 9/11 victims to not have seen justice done . \u201d\nWhile she recounted many of the administration \u2019 s internal agonizing debates over whether and how to take a more active approach in trying to stop the bloody , long-running civil war in Syria , she says it was the far less scrutinized administration debate over what to do about the current conflict in Yemen that remains one of her biggest regrets .
