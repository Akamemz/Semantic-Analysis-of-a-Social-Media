    "content": "President Obama had three goals coming into today 's press conference : First , to shift responsibility for the Obamacare fiasco onto insurers by saddling them with mid-implementation changes . Second , to quell Democratic panic on Capitol Hill . And third , to nudge the media toward turning the page on his healthcare debacle . He accomplished none of these things . Indeed , he made things worse -- sinking his presidency to a new nadir . A few jaw-dropping quotes :\n( 1 ) `` What we 're also discovering is that insurance is complicated to buy . '' Really , Mr. President ? You 're `` discovering '' this minor detail three years after you forced through a massive , unpopular overhaul of the entire system ? This statement is a breathtaking admission of abject dereliction and incompetence . ABC News ' Rick Klein also notes that the administration 's long-time talking points assured skeptical consumers that Obamacare would be easy to buy . That 's what all of the `` just like Expedia ! '' comparisons were about . Now , with millions getting booted from their plans , with a horribly broken website exacerbating the pain , Obama suddenly sees the light . A disgrace .\n( 2 ) `` What we 're essentially saying is the Affordable Care Act is not going to be the factor in what happens with folks in the individual market . '' Points for candor , I guess . Here the president explicitly spells out the motivation behind his so-called `` fix '' -- which even liberal wonks and industry experts are admitting are unworkable and will make the law 's problems worse . The goal is not to repair the damage ; the goal is to scapegoat someone else for the Obamacare wreckage that awaits . Insurance companies are the new villains . Insurers , who 've been in bed with Obama on this law from the beginning , are n't going to take the demonization lying down . Obama is decreeing a 13th-hour disruption that they can not comply with at this stage , and that will throw their finances into chaos . They will , in turn , hike premiums even more next year . This is the death spiral , ladies and gentlemen . And Obama will try to stand to the side and point at his former Obamacare partners as the culprits . It 's shameful . And I suspect it wo n't work . His credibility is in the tank .\n( 3 ) `` On the website , I was not informed directly that the website would not be working the way it was supposed to . '' In which President Obama once again claims that he was unaware of the long parade of internal and external warnings that Healthcare.gov was a historic trainwreck in the making . What is Obama aware of , pray tell ? What does he believe he job entails ?
