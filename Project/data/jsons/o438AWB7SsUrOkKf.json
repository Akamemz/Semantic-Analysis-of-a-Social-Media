    "content": "Donald Trump Jr. and other key figures involved in an infamous Trump Tower meeting with Russian figures during the heat of the 2016 presidential campaign largely downplayed its significance and said Hillary Clinton was hardly discussed despite past speculation , in newly released transcripts from Senate Judiciary Committee interviews .\nThe committee released more than 1,800 pages of transcripts Wednesday from interviews with numerous figures involved in the June 9 , 2016 meeting at Trump Tower . The controversial meeting , when it was revealed , fueled allegations of Trump campaign coordination with Russia \u2013 as Trump Jr. was apparently promised dirt on Clinton \u2019 s supposed involvement with Russia .\nBut Trump Jr. said he was `` skeptical '' going into the meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya .\n\u201c In his e-mail to me , Rob [ Goldstone ] suggested that someone had official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary Clinton and her dealings with Russia and that the information would be very useful to the campaign , \u201d Trump Jr. said , noting he was \u201c skeptical of his outreach \u201d as he only knew Goldstone as a \u201c colorful music promoter . \u201d\nRob Goldstone , who was a music promoter , arranged the meeting at the request of pop singer Emin Agalarov , and later said he thought the meeting was a `` bad idea . ''\n\u201c My skepticism was justified .

She also lamented the \u201c kind of apocalyptic Hollywood scenario what a private conversation between a lawyer and a businessman can be turned into . \u201d\nTrump Jr. testified that he had \u201c no way to gauge \u201d the \u201c reliability , credibility , or accuracy \u201d of anything Goldstone promised .\n\u201c I love it , \u201d Trump Jr. had written back to Goldstone at the time .

Trump Jr. also noted that he was not aware of who would be in the meeting .\nTrump said that Veselnitskaya did not provide any information on Clinton beyond \u201c very generally something about individuals connected to Russia supporting or funding Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton or the Democratic National Committee .
