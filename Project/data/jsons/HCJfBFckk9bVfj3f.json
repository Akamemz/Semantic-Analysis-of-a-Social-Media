Circuit Court of Appeals and its rogue district and appellate court judges .\nThe spectacle of the ostensibly nonpolitical chief justice engaged in a dispute with the president of the United States is insulting to the Supreme Court and to our system of justice .\nShame on the chief justice . What he did is unforgivable , especially after the corrosive Senate confirmation battle over now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh , who was the subject of bitter and baseless partisan attacks and character assassination by Senate Democrats .\nWith everyone looking for ways to remove the high court from the political thicket , Roberts strode arrogantly right into it . Sad day .\nRoberts responded Wednesday to comments President Trump made to reporters a day earlier , after a district court judge appointed by President Obama issued an order to stop Trump \u2019 s new emergency restrictions on asylum claims by immigrants from taking effect .\nU.S. District Judge Jon S. Tigar in San Francisco issued the nationwide injunction blocking the president \u2019 s restrictions . The restrictions would have made it harder for many of the thousands of Central American migrants now heading toward the U.S. border in caravans to apply for asylum in America .\n\u201c This was an Obama judge , and I 'll tell you what , it 's not going to happen like this anymore , '' the president said of Tigar . `` Everybody that wants to sue the U.S. \u2013 almost \u2013 they file their case in the 9th Circuit , and it means an automatic loss . No matter what you do , no matter how good your case is . And the 9th Circuit is really something we have to take a look at , because it 's not fair . ''\n\u201c We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges , Bush judges or Clinton judges , \u201d Roberts shot back Wednesday , as if he were facing Trump in a presidential candidate debate . \u201c What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them .

These judges previously issued an order blocking the president \u2019 s Travel Ban Executive Order that was designed to protect our country from terrorists crossing our borders . As President Trump correctly noted , the Supreme Court later overturned the ruling by the 9th U.S .
