    "content": "MPs are voting on a motion that could oust Theresa May 's government from power and start moves towards a general election .\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn , who tabled the no confidence motion , said the PM 's `` zombie '' administration had lost the right to govern , and they `` should do the right thing and resign '' .\nBut Mrs May said a general election was simply not `` in the national interest '' .\nIt comes 24 hours after MPs voted down the PM 's Brexit plans by a huge margin .\nClosing the debate , Labour 's deputy leader Tom Watson said : `` She is a prime minister without a majority for her flagship policy , with no authority and no plan B . ''\nBut Environment Secretary , Michael Gove , said Mrs May had provided `` inspirational leadership '' .\nHe launched a scathing attack on Mr Corbyn over a number of his positions on national security issues , saying to loud cheers from Conservative MPs that the country could not have confidence in him as a leader .\nMr Corbyn 's motion is backed by MPs from the SNP , Lib Dems , Plaid Cymru and Green Party .\nBut senior Labour figures accept it is not likely to succeed , as she has the backing of Tory rebels and the DUP 's 10 MPs , who less than 24 hours ago helped inflict a humiliating defeat on her .\nLabour says further no-confidence votes could follow if this one fails .\nMr Corbyn told MPs : `` The prime minister has consistently claimed that her deal , which has been decisively rejected , was good for Britain workers and business\u2026 she should have nothing to fear by going to the people . ''\nHe added that 2011 's Fixed-term Parliaments Act `` was never intended to prop up a zombie government '' , saying that the prime minister had `` lost control '' and suffered an `` historic and humiliating defeat '' .\nMr Watson added : `` I do n't doubt that [ Mrs May ] has sincerely attempted to fulfil the task given to us buy the voters in the referendum . I have no doubt too that she has tried her best and given it her all .\n`` But she has failed and I am afraid the failure is hers and hers alone .\n`` We know she has worked hard , but the truth is she is too set in her ways , too aloof to lead .\n`` She lacks the imagination and agility to bring people with her , she lacks the authority on the world stage to negotiate this deal . Ultimately she has failed . ''\nMrs May told MPs it was Parliament that decided to put the question of European Union membership to the people , `` and now Parliament must finish the job '' .\nShe said extending Article 50 , the legal mechanism taking the UK out of the EU on 29 March , to allow time for an election would mean `` delaying Brexit for who knows how long '' .\nShe repeated her offer of cross-party talks to find a way forward on Brexit , but has not so far invited the Labour leader to take part in them .\nA general election would `` deepen divisions when we need unity , it would bring chaos when we need certainty , '' Mrs May said .\nTory MP for Croydon South , Chris Philip , accused Mr Corbyn of `` shameless political opportunism '' , which put `` party interests ahead of national interests '' .\nJames Morris , Tory MP for Halesowen and Rowley Regis , said the motion was `` merely a tactical device by the opposition to cause chaos '' .\nAnd Conservative ex-minister Anna Soubry , who wants Mr Corbyn to back another EU referendum , questioned why her party were six points ahead of Labour in a weekend opinion poll , adding : `` Could it be because he 's the most hopeless Leader of the Opposition that we 've ever had ? ''\nBut other MPs backed Mr Corbyn , with Labour 's Stephen Doughty saying his leader was `` absolutely right '' to call for a general election `` because it is not just the government 's record on Brexit which is at stake tonight '' .\nLabour frontbencher Liam Byrne , MP for Birmingham , Hodge Hill , accused Mrs May of building `` a cage of red lines '' over Brexit .\nSNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford accused the government of `` seeking to run down the clock '' over Brexit and warned that the UK could `` crash out '' of the EU with no deal .\n`` The risk of a no deal is something that is unthinkable , '' he said . `` If the government and the prime minister want to drive the bus over the cliff , we will not be in the passenger seat . ''\nLib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said 48 % of the population who voted to remain in the EU had been `` totally disregarded '' by the government and Mrs May had an `` unwillingness to listen '' .\nHe said a general election provided `` another route and a welcome one '' that could resolve the issue , and he also called for a `` People 's Vote '' .\nThe leader of Plaid Cymru in Westminster , Liz Saville Roberts , who will vote against the government later , added her support for a `` People 's Vote '' , and called for the House to come together to make progress , condemning the `` pantomime point scoring '' taking place .\nThe DUP 's leader Arlene Foster and its Westminster leader Nigel Dodds have both said they will support the government in the confidence vote .\nBut , speaking after what she described as a `` useful discussion '' with the prime minister , Ms Foster said `` lessons will need to be learned '' from the defeat on the Brexit deal .\n`` The issue of the backstop needs to be dealt and we will continue to work to that end , '' she added .\nA shift to promising some kind of closer relationship with the EU , whether an actual customs union or something by a similar name , seems to be becoming more likely .\nThat 's not because everyone in the government , let alone in No 10 or in the Cabinet , thinks it 's the right thing to do - Liam Fox , whose job it is to pursue an independent trade policy , is not the only one with significant doubts .\nBut you can see a realistic route of getting that kind of arrangement through the House of Commons .\nOne former minister involved in trying to persuade the PM to soften up said : `` We have three days to push and push her to move , or there wo n't be anything that can get through . ''\nDavid Cameron , who resigned the day after the UK voted in 2016 to leave the EU , said he hoped , and thought , Mrs May would win Wednesday 's vote .\nSpeaking to the BBC he also insisted he did not regret calling the referendum .\nBBC political correspondent Iain Watson says that if the prime minister sees off the challenge , she will begin a series of meetings with `` senior Parliamentarians '' on Thursday .\nHe said Mrs May intended to retain her `` red lines '' - ruling out Labour 's demand for a customs union with the EU - with sources suggesting compromising on this would risk cabinet resignations .\nHowever , speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live , Justice Minister David Gauke suggested that the customs union option could not be ruled out , saying : `` We have got to engage and we have got to be constructive . ''\nEarlier Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom told the BBC the government was clear that it will not delay or revoke Article 50 , although Chancellor Philip Hammond reportedly suggested delaying Brexit in a conference call on Tuesday evening .\nUnder the Fixed Term Parliaments Act 2011 , UK general elections are only supposed to happen every five years . The next one is due in 2022 .\nBut a vote of no confidence lets MPs decide on whether they want the government to continue . The motion must be worded : `` That this House has no confidence in Her Majesty 's Government . ''\nIf a majority of MPs vote for the motion then it starts a 14-day countdown .\nIf during that time the current government , or any other alternative government can not win a new vote of confidence , then an early general election would be called .\nThat election can not happen for at least 25 working days .\nEuropean leaders reacted to Tuesday 's vote with dismay but gave no indication they were willing to make concessions .\nSeveral have warned of increased chances of a no-deal Brexit , which many MPs fear will cause chaos at ports and damage industry .\nMichel Barnier , the EU 's chief Brexit negotiator , said Brussels `` profoundly regrets '' how the UK 's MPs voted and said it was `` up to the British authorities '' to indicate how it would move forward .\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker urged the UK to clarify its intentions , saying : `` Time is almost up .
