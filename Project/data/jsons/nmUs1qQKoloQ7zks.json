The death of President George H.W. Bush on Friday prompted the House of Representatives, in its grieving, to take the whole week off. Instead of arguing about funding for physical barriers on the U.S.-Mexico border at Bush\u2019s state funeral on Wednesday, congressional leaders have agreed to punt the deadline for a partial government shutdown two weeks. The new date, Dec. 21, is, not coincidentally, just four days ahead of Christmas, when lawmakers traditionally abandon their firm ideological principles and just vote for whatever they have to in order to make their flights home.\n\nThe two weeks of additional brainstorming are unlikely to produce a new way to bridge the gap between $5 billion and $1.6 billion: That first figure is what President Donald Trump is requesting in \u201cwall money\u201d and the second what Senate Democrats are willing to give him in \u201cfencing money.\u201d The spending deal, which would lump together all seven incomplete appropriations bills, is just about entirely resolved except for that gulf.
