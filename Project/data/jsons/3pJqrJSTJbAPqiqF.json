I \u2019 m hoping we can work together to find common ground , \u201d DeVos said , rebuffing a request by U.S. Sen. Patty Murray , D-Wash. , that she vow not to propose funding cuts for any public schools .\nDeVos , 59 , stepped before the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee for a rare nighttime confirmation hearing , facing a broad spectrum of questions that ranged from early childhood education , free college and the Obama administration \u2019 s crackdown on college sexual assaults to her own personal beliefs about sexual orientation and any support she gave for controversial \u201c conversion therapy , \u201d which she denied .\n\u201c I believe in equality and I firmly believe in the intrinsic value of each individual , and that every student should have the assurance of a safe and discrimination-free place to become educated , \u201d said DeVos , telling U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin , D-Wis. , that as regards the alleged support , she might \u201c be confusing some other family members in some of those contributions , and also looking at contributions from 18 or 20 years ago . \u201d\n\u201c As a mom I just can \u2019 t imagine having a child that would feel discriminated against for any reason , and I would want my child in a safe environment , \u201d she said . She acknowledged , however , that her family may have given as much as $ 200 million to Republican candidates and causes over the years .\nIn response to questions , she also promised that neither she nor her husband , former Amway head and heir Dick DeVos , would be politically active while she serves , if she is confirmed . She also said that given her family \u2019 s complex financial arrangements , she will resolve any conflicts of interest . \u201c I will not be conflicted , \u201d she said .\nShe also defended her support of charter schools and school choice in Detroit , saying there is \u201c a lot that has gone right in Detroit \u201d given the poverty there and rebuking reports that charter schools haven \u2019 t delivered as big a change in education in the city as promised .\nWhile Democrats went on the attack , Republicans on the committee lined up to defend her : The chairman , Sen. Lamar Alexander , R-Tenn. , opened the hearing with a strong endorsement , saying , \u201c Betsy DeVos in my opinion is on our children \u2019 s side \u2026 I believe she \u2019 s in the mainstream of public opinion and her critics are not. \u201d He went onto say she has fought to help low-income parents have choice in education options and that 73 % of Americans support school choice\nTold by DeVos that she supports public education , U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy , R-La. , said , \u201c Man that \u2019 s amazing , you would think some would have us think you do not . \u201d\nDeVos came into the confirmation hearing a week after it had initially been scheduled and three days before Trump \u2019 s inauguration at the U.S. Capitol . Democrats , teachers \u2019 unions and others have loudly denounced DeVos \u2019 nomination , arguing that her vocal support of vouchers and school choice programs could undermine public schools .\n\u201c Betsy DeVos is a billionaire who has spent her career & fortune rigging the system to privatize and defund public ed , \u201d Randi Weingarten , head of the 1.6-million-member American Federation of Teachers union in a tweet earlier today .\nAlexander said the committee could vote on DeVos \u2019 nomination as early as next Tuesday , after which it would be sent to the floor of the U.S. Senate for final confirmation . Murray , the top Democrat on the panel , complained that the hearing should have been delayed until the Office of Government Ethics sent a letter on DeVos and any agreements she will make to ensure there are no conflicts of interest .\nDemocrats , who have little chance of blocking DeVos \u2019 nomination , still put up strong resistance at Tuesday \u2019 s hearing . Sen. Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass. , tried to pin DeVos on a commitment to enforce employment rules at for-profit institutions ; Sen. Bernie Sanders , I-Vt. , urged DeVos to embrace free tuition at all public colleges and universities , which she called \u201c a really interesting idea \u201d but said policy makers have to \u201c consider that in life nothing is truly free , somebody will pay for it . \u201d\nIn a particularly sharp exchange , Sen. Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass , asked DeVos if she or any family members had ever taken out a loan or been awarded a grant from the federal government to pay for college . DeVos said she hadn \u2019 t .\nWarren then noted that Trump last year paid a $ 25 million settlement to students of Trump University who complained that they didn \u2019 t get what they paid for . Asked if DeVos would enforce rules that require career colleges to offer saleable skills to students , DeVos said instead that she would \u201c review \u201d the rule .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t understand about \u2018 reviewing \u2019 it . We talked about this in my office , \u201d said Warren . \u201c There are already rules in place to stop waste , fraud and abuse and I don \u2019 t understand how you can not be sure about enforcing them . \u2026 If you can \u2019 t commit to use the tools that are already available to you in the Department of Education , then I don \u2019 t see how you can be the secretary . \u201d\nShe also declined to vow to keep in place Obama administration rules requiring colleges and universities to be more responsible for cracking down on sexual assaults , saying she needs to look at them . \u201c Sexual assault anywhere and any place is a problem , \u201d she said . Pushed by Sen. Chris Murphy , D-Conn. , to say whether guns belong in schools , DeVos said it \u2019 s an issue \u201c best left to locales and states to decide . \u201d\nShe added that for a school in a place like rural Idaho , educators might need \u201c a gun in the school to protect from potential grizzlies . \u201d\nProtesters , many of them from Michigan , attended the hearing , filling up a hallway outside the packed committee room . Among them was 17-year-old Dannah Wilson , who had ridden one of two buses from Detroit the night before with about 120 other people . Wilson , a senior at Cornerstone Leadership and Business High School , a Detroit private school , said she \u2019 d come \u201c representing students across Detroit . I just honestly want to know how she feels and responds to these questions . \u201d\nWilson said her mother pays $ 11,000 for her and each of her two younger sisters to attend the school .\nWilson \u2019 s mother , Dawn Wilson-Clark , said her five children have attended some 22 Detroit schools in all . \u201c Choice is not the issue , \u201d she said . \u201c The issue is quality . We have a lot of choices , but they \u2019 re not quality and the charter schools are not held to the same accountability that the public schools are. \u201d At one point last year , Wilson-Clark said , she was driving 200 miles a week to four different schools \u201c trying to get my children a quality education . \u201d\nShoniqua Kemp , another Detroit parent with the 482 Forward education organizing network , said \u201c quality is a problem \u201d in Detroit schools , even with a wide array of choices .\n\u201c School choices can be a good thing \u2013 however , give me quality . My choice shouldn \u2019 t be \u2018 Rancid tomato \u2019 or \u2018 Pick one from the garbage. \u2019 That \u2019 s not fair . \u201d\nDeVos came into the hearing with many supporters . Writing in the Detroit News today , Michigan Gov . Rick Snyder praised her selection , saying she \u201c has a big heart and she believes strongly that parental control of education through school choice is integral to improving the performance of our K-12 system . \u201d\n\u201c Contrary to the misleading picture the teachers unions are trying to paint , she shares her support for school choice with several fair-minded and prominent Democrats , including Barack Obama \u2019 s two education secretaries , John King and Arne Duncan , \u201d Snyder wrote .\nSeveral school reformers , including political rivals of Trump \u2019 s , have praised DeVos . Former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush called her `` an outstanding pick , \u201d saying her allegiance \u201c is to families , particularly those struggling at the bottom of the economic ladder , not to an outdated public education model that has failed them from one generation to the next . ''\n\u201c All in all , she \u2019 s a pretty conventional choice , \u201d said Rick Hess , director of education policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute , a right-leaning Washington think tank .\nHess noted last month that President Obama \u2019 s 2015 nomination of King , then New York \u2019 s education commissioner , \u201c was greeted courteously and approved rapidly \u201d by the Republican-controlled Senate , despite King \u2019 s \u201c troubled tenure in New York , one that featured a disastrous rollout of the Common Core . \u201d\nBut while school choice advocates say DeVos \u2019 s efforts have largely succeeded , others say her work in Michigan has brought disappointing , sometimes chaotic results .\nThe DeVoses have long sought to bring more private competition to the public school system . In 2000 , the couple led a failed petition drive to institute a voucher system in Michigan that would allow parents to use public money to send their children to private schools . The state constitution prohibits such use of public funds .\nVoters overwhelmingly rejected the proposal . But a similar plan is the centerpiece of Trump 's education plan . He wants to spend $ 20 billion in federal funding now being spent on other things \u2014 and expects states to kick in even more \u2014 to provide to pay $ 12,000 in private school tuition for every high-poverty child in the country .\nThe couple also played a role in getting Michigan \u2019 s charter school law passed in 1993 , and ever since have worked to protect charters from additional regulation . When Michigan lawmakers in 2016 were considering a measure that would have added oversight for charter schools in Detroit , members of the DeVos family poured $ 1.45 million into legislators \u2019 campaign coffers ? \u2014 ? an average of $ 25,000 a day for seven weeks . Oversight was not included in the final legislation .\nAs a result , Michigan \u2019 s charter sector is among the least regulated in the country . About 80 % of charters in Michigan are run by private companies , far more than in any other state .\nThe National Association of Charter School Authorizers has said Michigan is well below average in the number of underperforming charter schools that close , and Douglas Harris , a professor of economics at Tulane University , last November called DeVos \u2019 appointment a \u201c triumph of ideology over evidence , \u201d saying that as one of the architects of Detroit \u2019 s charter school system , she holds partial responsibility for what even charter school backers acknowledge is \u201c the biggest school reform disaster in the country . \u201d\nMichigan 's charter-friendly policies have allowed nearly 100 schools to open , run mostly by for-profit charter-school-management organizations . That has given families wider choice over their children 's schools , but it has also created an expensive oversupply of about 30,000 seats in city classrooms .\nCurrent U.S. Education Secretary John King , who cut his teeth teaching in and founding charter schools in Massachusetts , last week noted that Michigan \u2019 s weak charter school law has brought \u201c a proliferation of \u201d low-performing schools . \u201c In Michigan , I do think the lack of strong accountability in their charter law , and in their charter sector , has harmed public education generally , and has harmed , ultimately , students , \u201d he said .",
