I call it dignified rage , \u201d says Irinea Buendia , whose daughter was a victim of femicide . Her daughters \u2019 death was initially labelled a suicide . After five years of legal battles , her daughter \u2019 s husband was arrested , and the country \u2019 s Supreme Court ruled that all violent deaths of women must be investigated as possible femicides .\nTheir so-called \u201c glitter movement \u201d has attracted plenty of backlash , though \u2013 from misogynistic slurs , to criticisms that support their goals , but not their methods . But many of the women protesting see themselves as challenging not just impunity , and rape , and patriarchal attitudes , but ideas about how women ought to push for change .\nLast month , after a teen accused four police officers of raping her in their patrol car , that anger burst into the open . Outraged feminists in Mexico City doused the city \u2019 s security minister in pink sparkles , and days later defaced the capital \u2019 s most iconic monument . \u201c Terremoto feminista , \u201d they called another day of demonstrations this month : \u201c Feminist earthquake . \u201d\nBut Irinea Buendia didn \u2019 t mind . She was thinking of Mariana , chanting for an end to gender violence in Mexico , a photo of her murdered daughter hanging by a string around her neck .\nThis latest demonstration of women was organized under the hashtag # terremotofeminista ( feminist earthquake ) and controversially called on Sept. 19 , the day the city marks two of its deadliest quakes . But it was just one that has gained force \u2013 and backlash \u2013 here in recent weeks .\nIn August women , Ms. Buendia among them again , were so outraged by allegations that police had raped minors that they doused the Mexico City \u2019 s security minister in pink sparkles , and days later defaced the capital \u2019 s most iconic monument . It became known as the \u201c glitter movement \u201d \u2013 and outside feminist circles , it wasn \u2019 t widely welcomed . \u201c They call us vandals , I call it dignified rage , \u201d Ms. Buendia says .\nIn a country where 41 % of women say they \u2019 ve experienced sexual violence \u2013 and nine are killed each day , according to the United Nations \u2013 female anger is mounting . But with it has come even greater outrage directed back at them , with critics lobbing sexist slurs . Others support their goals , but not their methods . Yet far from viewing it as a step back , many of these women say the rejection of their movement is a sign that a paradigm shift is underway .\nAlfredo Sosa/Staff After police labeled her daughter 's 2010 death a suicide , Irinia Buendia 's efforts to get answers resulted in a landmark Supreme Court ruling in 2015 that sets precedent for future cases of gender violence .\nAndrea Medina , a lawyer who has worked with many victims of gender violence over the decades , sees anger against the movement as a sign that the status quo is giving way . Society is reacting as it sees women put their foot down , she says . \u201c It \u2019 s a form of inhibiting women from continuing to denounce violence . They are saying , \u2018 You can not be angry , you can \u2019 t defend yourself , you have to accept violence quietly . \u2019 \u201d\nShe believes , despite how unpopular the protests are , it is a turning point . \u201c Public silence of the victims has been broken . \u201d\nFemicides , or the murder of women for being women , have been on the agenda in Mexico for decades , especially since the notorious murders in Ciudad Juarez starting in the early \u2019 90s : Hundreds of women were violently killed in the border town , and most of the cases were unsolved . But marching was rare , especially for victims or their families .\nAs the rate of women \u2019 s murders has grown \u2013 with 30 % of the 52,000 deaths registered since 1985 happening since 2010 , according to 2016 government figures \u2013 so has the feminist response .\nLike in many women \u2019 s marches , it was specific cases that pushed women to the streets this summer \u2013 as in South Africa , where the brutal rape and murder of a teenager led to protests earlier this month .\nHere , it was two girls \u2013 a 17-year-old who says four police officers raped her in their patrol car , and a 16-year-old who accused an officer of raping her in a museum . But if marches are spurred by local events , activists say , they are catalyzed by global ones , from abortion debates in Argentina or Spain to # MeToo and its iterations around the world . For Yndira Sandoval , who belongs to a feminist collective here , \u201c The movement has never been more alive , more forceful , more awake , or more powerful . \u201d\nThe cases here set off a particular fury because of the girls \u2019 ages . But it was also their vulnerability in the face of impunity : that the very authority figures meant to protect them from wider violence are their alleged violators .\nIt was particularly painful for Ms. Buendia . Her daughter was found dead in June of 2010 . Suicide , said her husband , a police officer . Ms. Buendia had never heard the word femicide . But she felt in her heart that her 29-year-old , a law student who loved to dance and sketch and whose favorite character was the gloomy Eeyore \u2013 a detail she says doesn \u2019 t square with Mariana \u2019 s rosy disposition \u2013 wouldn \u2019 t take her own life .\nShe fought for the next five years to have the case reopened , which led to the arrest of Mariana \u2019 s former spouse ; his case is still in the legal system . Her battle led to a landmark Supreme Court ruling in 2015 \u2013 that all violent deaths of women must be investigated as possible femicides , among other things \u2013 and now she \u2019 s part of a group on the front lines of the marches that calls itself \u201c Moms in Resistance . \u201d\n\u201c Almost all cases hurt me , because it \u2019 s like they are killing my daughter all over again , \u201d she says , the day before the latest march .\nThe next day , she and the women \u2013 moms and grandmothers , and young and single women alike \u2013 came to the streets to protest about a long list of grievances , from femicide , to rape , to impunity , to patriarchal attitudes in general . But they also see a role for themselves in challenging perceptions of how women should effect change : fiercely , they say .\nGabriela Mijares , who works in public administration and has attended all these recent marches , raises a conch shell to her lips and blows to initiate the protest \u2013 what ancient warriors used to do to instill fear in their adversaries , she says .\nMexican journalist Ricardo Raphael , writing in the newsmagazine Proceso after the launch of the \u201c glitter movement , \u201d says that men from Julius Caesar to Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata have used their anger to transform societies and are celebrated for it , but there is a double standard for women . \u201c If a woman dares to exercise it , it is because she is a sorceress , like Circe , or the Harpies that harassed Ulysses . \u201d\nThat kind of social bias , the women say , is part of what they \u2019 re pushing back against \u2013 walking with pink and red spray paint bottles , and graffiti-ing walls and pavement alike with the Venus sign and a raised fist .\n\u201c It is anger , but it is what protects us . ...
