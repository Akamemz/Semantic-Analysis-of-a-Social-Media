Bush went home to Texas nearly six years ago , but the nation is still working through the contentious national security legacy he left behind .\nA hotly disputed Senate report on the CIA 's brutal interrogation tactics is tearing open barely healed political wounds first opened after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks . The report found CIA tactics were more brutal than previously known and accused the agency of keeping the Bush White House and Congress in the dark about them .\nThe questions raised by the Intelligence Committee 's document -- about how to wage a relentless war on terrorism within constitutional and moral constraints -- seem as intense as ever .\nJUST WATCHED Did torture help find bin Laden ?
