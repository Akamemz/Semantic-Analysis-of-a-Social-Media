Will Clinton clear the field ?\nThe ranks of Democratic governors are filled with ambitious politicians boasting records that would probably play well with primary voters in 2016 .\nBut even as they eye a move from the statehouse to the White House , there \u2019 s broad recognition among the chief executives that the next generation of Democrats may have to wait longer than four more years to take their place as President Barack Obama \u2019 s heir .\nNowhere is The Hillary Factor felt more acutely , and painfully , than in the same elite club of policy innovators and budget balancers that vaulted her husband onto the national political scene in the 1980s .\nAmong the Democratic governors who descended on Washington this weekend for the National Governors Association winter meeting , the only difference of opinion when it came to Secretary Clinton was whether she would clear the 2016 field entirely or merely loom colossus-like over the race until , and upon entering , the campaign .\nOr , as Colorado Gov .
