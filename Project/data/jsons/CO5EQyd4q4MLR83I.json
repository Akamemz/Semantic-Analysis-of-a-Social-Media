Then Jim Bob and his wife , Michelle , waited more than a year to contact the authorities .\nThe new report , which is less redacted than initial documents , confirms that Duggar was 15 years old when he first molested his five-year-old sister . He also admitted seven separate instances of abuse to his father before he or any of his sisters was taken for professional counseling ; InTouch notes that it remains unclear whether Jim Bob and Michelle brought their children for counseling of their own volition , or if intervention was mandated once law enforcement officials did become involved in the sexual assault allegations .\n`` James [ Jim Bob ] said that in March of 2002 [ redacted , Josh ] who had just turned 14 , came to him very upset and crying , '' the police report states . `` James said that [ redacted , Josh ] had told him that he had been sneaking into [ redacted , his sisters \u2019 ] room at night and had been touching [ redacted , his sisters ] on the breasts and vaginal areas while they were sleeping .
