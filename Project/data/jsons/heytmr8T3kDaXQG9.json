    "content": "Hillary Clinton campaigns in Philadelphia in April . \u201c I think she learned there \u2019 s anger on the left , \u201d former Philadelphia Mayor Ed Rendell says . | Getty How Bernie changed Hillary Sanders has left a lasting imprint on Clinton \u2019 s candidacy , even if few in her camp are willing to admit it .\nNo candidate ever wants a tough primary challenge , and Hillary Clinton has found the mass appeal of a self-described socialist particularly irksome . But as she shifts her gaze toward the general election and Donald Trump , Clinton may have actually learned some lessons from Bernie Sanders .\nOn the eve of the Indiana primary , Clinton was touring Appalachia , making an appeal to voters who have been energized by the anti-trade message of both Sanders and Trump . Sanders \u2019 focus on deep economic discontent , inequality and a political system dominated by Big Money helped inform and polish her response . \u201c Talk about a ripple effect . It \u2019 s just devastating communities , \u201d Clinton told steelworkers at an Italian restaurant in Ashland , Kentucky .\n\u201c You can see in her rhetoric and positioning that Hillary Clinton has heard this message loud and clear , \u201d said political strategist David Axelrod , a former adviser to President Barack Obama . \u201c It \u2019 s reflected in her messaging and very specific policies . The challenge is to persuade the skeptical that this will be a genuine focus in the White House and not just a passing political fancy . \u201d\nThat challenge is most obvious on some of Sanders \u2019 signature issues . On the minimum wage , for instance , Clinton now emphasizes her support for the nationwide \u201c fight for $ 15 , \u201d even though she supports raising the federal minimum wage to $ 12 . On trade , Clinton has struggled to get past the impression that she flipped her position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership . Some voters found it hard to swallow when she cited specific objections to the final version of the massive agreement she had once called the \u201c gold standard \u201d of trade deals .\nClinton \u2019 s operatives deny that she had anything to learn from Sanders and point to her consistency on the issues : She says she still supports some trade deals ; she wants a $ 15 minimum wage decided on a state-by-state basis ; and in her kickoff speech on Roosevelt Island in April 2015 , she raised the specter of income inequality in a laundry list of issues her campaign would seek to address .\n\u201c While many of you are working multiple jobs to make ends meet , \u201d she told the crowd on that warm spring day , \u201c you see the top 25 hedge fund managers making more than all of America \u2019 s kindergarten teachers combined . And , often paying a lower tax rate . \u201d\nShe said she wanted to be the president \u201c for the successful and the struggling . \u201d\nBut since then , as Sanders \u2019 strident criticism of Wall Street has won him a devoted progressive following , her rhetoric toward Wall Street \u2014 home to many of her top donors \u2014 has become increasingly more heated . It \u2019 s become a more prominent component of her stump speech . And she has criticized corporations , vowing , for example , to go after price-gouging pharmaceutical companies .\n\u201c I think she learned there \u2019 s anger on the left , \u201d said former Pennsylvania Gov . Ed Rendell , a Clinton supporter . \u201c Had she run unopposed , or with only Martin O \u2019 Malley , she never would have learned that . \u201d\nRendell said she has addressed that anger \u2014 \u201c partially \u201d \u2014 by emphasizing pieces of her own record that fit the narrative that animates Sanders \u2019 supporters , including her support of Dodd-Frank banking reforms and emphasizing that her Wall Street reform prescriptions are \u201c tougher \u201d than Sanders \u2019 plans to break up the big banks .\n\u201c The same is true on income inequality , \u201d Rendell added . \u201c She obviously cared about it , but I \u2019 m not sure it would have been as much a part of her basic message as it is because of Bernie \u2019 s challenge , and I think she \u2019 s got some good things to say about income inequality . \u201d\nAt the same time , she has advocated a mainstream Democratic position of raising taxes on the wealthy but not the middle class , and does not advocate expanding Social Security for all .\n\u201c Did she know in advance that wages had been stagnant and she \u2019 d have to come up with something that was going to do that ? Sure , \u201d said Lee Miringoff , director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion . \u201c It probably moved its way up into higher in her stump speech because of what Sanders was saying . \u201d\nSince that kickoff , speech Clinton has also put a new focus on guns , which she hadn \u2019 t even even mentioned during her launch , one of the few issues where she can maneuver to Sanders \u2019 left . In time , she embraced gun policy as a moral center of her campaign .\nClinton 's operatives insist they always knew it would be a battle and had planned to fight for every vote . But Sanders \u2019 challenge \u2014 which is still ongoing as the Vermont senator insists he \u2019 ll take the fight to the Democratic convention in July \u2014 lit a fire under Clinton , one that may have gotten her in fighting shape for the nasty battle that \u2019 s expected this fall .\nIn Nevada , for instance , fresh off of her devastating New Hampshire loss , Clinton hustled the back rooms of casinos , meeting with cafeteria employees and blackjack dealers working the night shift , and visiting their break room after midnight . She made multiple appearances on picket lines with members of the powerful Culinary Union who were striking over health care costs .\nTwo months later , she kept a similar pace . In her home state of New York , which she needed to win big to kill Sanders \u2019 momentum , Clinton embraced her campaign \u2019 s idea of contrasting small events with Sanders \u2019 big rallies . The former senator and secretary of state , now more of a visiting dignitary , eagerly embraced the return to shoe leather campaigning , showing up at restaurants , appearing in the subway , at block parties and even a housing project .\nAll that practice at retail politics helped a candidate who admits she \u2019 s no natural at campaigning . \u201c She came out of the box rusty , \u201d admitted Mo Elleithee , who served as Clinton \u2019 s traveling press secretary in 2008 . \u201c I think the come-out-of-nowhere strength of Sanders \u2019 campaign forced them to reorient , both in terms of infrastructure and message , to make it crisper , and speak to some of the anxieties he was speaking to . Had she walked into this nomination , I \u2019 d be far more worried about the general . \u201d\nClinton also got stronger on the issue of race , another area that quickly emerged as a strong contrast with Sanders , who failed to address the issue outside the context of economic inequality . Clinton delivered multiple , wide-ranging speeches about systematic racism in the country and criminal justice reform , in contrast to Sanders \u2019 inequality-focused rhetoric . Clinton 's campaign has distanced itself from Bill Clinton \u2019 s 1994 crime bill , leaving her husband to defend his own record , and she continues to speak on issues that matter to African-Americans : expanding voting rights , gun safety and criminal justice reform .\nThe race issue that has become part of the core of Clinton 's campaign was n't even mentioned in her Roosevelt Island kickoff speech . Now , she figures to be stronger in November among African-American voters than she might otherwise have been .\nAt her campaign launch , Clinton did make a coy reference to being \u201c the youngest candidate in the race. \u201d On that front , the 74-year-old Vermont senator presented Clinton with a bow-tied present : He took the issue of age off the table . \u201c There would have been a different narrative to the stamina stuff , questions about does she have what it takes , \u201d said Miringoff . \u201c He kept her middle-aged . \u201d\nClinton operatives for their part deny that Sanders has taught them anything at all . \u201c Everybody is forgetting where we started the campaign , \u201d said senior strategist Joel Benenson . \u201c The reason she has been winning consistently and amassed so many more votes is she didn \u2019 t just start talking about these things , she built her plans around this . The [ breaking down ] barriers message she has been delivering is a much broader message than anyone in this race has talked about . \u201d\nDelegates Remaining : 56 Delegates 2,814 1,893 56 2,382 Delegates Needed for Nomination\nSome of Clinton \u2019 s top donors go one step further : They insist Sanders \u2019 presence in the race has been \u201c useless \u201d and negative , providing \u201c she \u2019 s not qualified \u201d soundbites to Trump , who has admitted he has clipped-and-saved them for future ads , and depleting the cash reserves she will need to compete in a general election . Others deny that she has been pushed on any issues , and note that any distinctions between the candidates are a matter of nuance .\nIf nothing else , Sanders \u2019 appeal among the under-30 set revealed to Clinton \u2019 s Brooklyn brain trust that they have a major problem with millennial voters .
