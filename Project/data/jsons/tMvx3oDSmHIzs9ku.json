    "content": "The mass shooting in Orlando really infuriated liberals all over again about the lack of gun control -- including liberal journalists and comedians . NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt blandly promoted how `` late-night hosts have once again found themselves straddling the lines between comedians and consolers . ''\nBut they were n't consolers . They were agitators for the liberal agenda . On The Daily Show , host Trevor Noah sympathized with Obama : `` He 's hosted 12 state dinners , but he 's had to give 16 mass shooting addresses . '' And none of those apparently ever reflected badly on Obama 's leadership on terrorism ? Noah lectured for gun control : `` America needs to ask itself the question : Do you want to be a country that takes reasonable measures to protect its citizens , or should we tell the president to prepare speech number 17 ? ''\nOn NBC 's Late Night , host Seth Meyers , the only issue was guns . `` This was an attack on LGBT people fueled by bigotry and hatred . And the shooter was apparently inspired by ISIS , `` he acknowledged . `` But we 're gon na talk about guns . Because whether the shooter was a homophobe , mentally ill , a terrorist inspired by ISIS or all three , what allowed him to kill so many people on Sunday was his gun . And that means we 're likely about to enter yet another contentious national debate about gun control . ''\nLater , Meyers lamented , `` When given a chance , Congress consistently chooses nothing as a course of action . ''\nConan O'Brien on TBS used almost the exact same language about banning `` assault rifles '' as Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail . He began by noting `` I 've always , always made a policy to stick to my job and keep my opinions to myself . '' Do n't buy that . He likes comparing Donald Trump to Hitler and Mussolini .\nBut ? `` I simply do not understand why anybody in this country is allowed to purchase and own a semiautomatic assault rifle . It makes no sense to me . These are weapons of war and they have no place in civilian life . ''\nO'Brien can take his ten-pound pompadour to Cuba and make a communist dictatorship look colorful and lovable , and keep his opinions to himself on their repression . But conservatives and Republicans ? They 're like Hitler and they like murderous assault rifles .\nAlso on TBS , Samantha Bee echoed Conan O'Brien in sounding like a Democrat , with added rage : `` Sam Bee wants to take your guns away ! Yes . The ones that mow down a roomful of people in seconds ? Yes , I do want to take those guns away ! These high-capacity penis substitutes are a sh -- ty choice for hunting and home protection , but perfect for portable mayhem . ''\nBut Bee added a layer of contempt for anyone who offered their prayers of support to the victims and their families : `` The biggest , most helpful thing you can do to ensure this never happens again is sit quietly in a room with your eyes closed , talking to nobody . ''\nShe concluded her rant with a mean-spirited prayer of her own : `` I 'm just going to pray . Are you there , God ? It 's me , Sam . Please , bless the victims and their friends and families in their time of unspeakable pain . Give us the courage to say no more and while you 're at it , please send the NRA a plague of boils . Amen . ''\nIf Lester Holt thinks Samantha Bee is a `` consoler , '' he 's clearly in denial about her weekly ragefest .\nThese comedians are all angry that their editorials never seem to make a dent - in part , because they can not acknowledge that their `` solutions '' ( like background checks ) never seem to be the answer to these unfolding mass-shooting horrors .",
