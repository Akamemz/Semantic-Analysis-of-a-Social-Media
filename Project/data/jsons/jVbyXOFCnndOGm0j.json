Though Lebanon is perhaps not the best illustration for the Pontiff to draw upon .\nLebanon was a majority Christian country up until the 1960s . In the 1970s , after an influx of Muslim refugees , tens of thousands of Christians were ethnically cleansed from the country .\nSince 2005 there have been as many as 14 terrorist attacks a year in Lebanon , and the UK government \u2019 s travel advice on Lebanon advises against traveling to certain parts of the country as there is a \u201c high threat from terrorism . \u201d\nPope Francis criticised France \u2019 s \u201c exaggeration \u201d of the separation of church and state , expressing disapproval of the country \u2019 s ban on the niqab in public places .
