Yet , if carefully planned , school reopening could be done in many places , experts suggest .\nAs governments allow restaurants , malls , and even gyms to reopen with strict new guidelines , schools are seeming a policy afterthought to many . In the United States , President Donald Trump is pressuring governors to reopen schools in person come fall .

Although her employer has figured out how to get staff back to work , and her kid \u2019 s summer camp is operating , there is no concrete plan \u2013 or even a best guess in many places \u2013 for how to get millions of school-aged children in North America safely back to class .\nInstead , she feels that authorities have left families \u2013 and particularly women \u2013 to simply \u201c figure it out . \u201d\n\u201c There is a pervasive thought that women know how to deal with the children , women will figure it out , \u201d she says . \u201c But coping with something for a few months is very different than coping with something looking out over a year . I literally don \u2019 t know how I do it on top of working full time . \u201d\nAs governments allow restaurants , malls , and even gyms to reopen with strict new guidelines , the 2020-21 academic year is seeming to many a policy afterthought , something for local school districts or families to solve .\nIn the United States , the debate has surged in recent days as President Donald Trump has pressured governors to reopen schools in person come fall . Yet with COVID-19 cases climbing across many states , and several large urban school systems already announcing plans for online-only or hybrid instruction , a full return to school appears unlikely to occur for many students .\nBut the problem remains : The economy can \u2019 t grow without kids in safe , full-time care . In the U.S. , parents with minor children make up nearly one-third of the workforce , and as of 2017 , 41 % of children relied on their mother as the sole or primary breadwinner for their family .\nCompeting priorities , a streak of individualism , and perhaps most crucially , stretched resources \u2013 not to mention the uncertain science around COVID-19 and the anxieties parents feel about sending their kids back into group settings \u2013 have conspired to leave families and their employers in prolonged limbo .

Schools do not generate tax revenues and cost state governments money . And public school teachers and administrators continue to earn their full salaries during remote learning . \u201c There wasn \u2019 t the natural advocacy base to open schools , \u201d she says .\nDr. Cohodes also believes individualism , particularly deep in American society , plays a role in why schools have not taken center stage in the economic discussion . \u201c The business itself can decide whether or not to reopen . You can decide whether or not you feel comfortable patronizing a store or going to get your hair cut , \u201d she says . \u201c We \u2019 re a very individualist society , but that also puts the responsibility and onus on the individual , and schools are a collective responsibility . \u201d\nIt also makes it hard to plan reopening as a community , recognizing that bars might need to close now if schools are to open later , says Elizabeth Powers , associate professor in the economics department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign . \u201c They \u2019 re all bad choices . We don \u2019 t want people not to work at bars and restaurants , but I think there has to be a conversation . We can \u2019 t just open everything across the board . \u201d\nJuliette Kayyem is a former assistant secretary for homeland security under former President Barack Obama . School is not considered \u201c essential infrastructure \u201d the way communications or transportation are , those systems that \u201c separate us from chaos , \u201d she says .\nThis was made clear when schools were shut down to \u201c flatten the curve , \u201d with no plan in place to reopen , while states like Arizona or Florida reopened bars and restaurants early despite public health warnings . \u201c I think we just did not conceptualize the role of schools in making our society function in the same way that we would if a hurricane brought down an electrical grid , \u201d says Ms. Kayyem , a senior lecturer at Harvard \u2019 s Kennedy School of Government . \u201c Upon closing all the schools , which seemed like the right approach in March , somehow we waited until July to sort of figure this out . \u201d\nFrustration has grown over social media , with # schoolsbeforebars trending . In some ways it \u2019 s become more intense in Canada , since the numbers of confirmed cases and hospitalizations have continued on a downward decline , and the academic year has not become a political wedge issue . The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto have argued for as normal a return to class as possible \u2013 given the emerging science around risks associated with children and as school openings elsewhere haven \u2019 t seeded the same kind of outbreaks as concerts or conferences .\nWhen Ottawa-based policy analyst Lauren Dobson-Hughes wrote a column in Canada \u2019 s The Globe and Mail early this month , the conversation lit up north of the border . \u201c Education is a human right . But you would not know this in most of Canada , \u201d she wrote . \u201c With restaurants , bars , golf clubs , and gyms reopening , it is increasingly obvious that we have our priorities utterly backward . Education and child care must be our biggest priority , not a mere afterthought delegated to school boards and schools . \u201d\n\u201c I think every mother I know went , \u2018 Yes . Plus a thousand , \u2019 \u201d says Alex Usher , president of Higher Education Strategy Associates , a Toronto-based consultancy . Mr . Usher knows there are unions , regulations , access , transport , and a host of other barriers to consider for safe reopenings \u2013 but that \u2019 s why provinces should be mobilizing now with every bit of creativity they can , he argues . His own work is concentrated in higher education , so he is well aware of how space in those institutions will be available next term .\n\u201c In Toronto , we \u2019 ve got a massive convention center sitting empty . Why not use community centers ? Why not use churches ? \u201d he says . \u201c None of these are perfect solutions , but they are options beyond what the government seems to be considering . \u201d\nSix weeks away from September , Ontario \u2019 s Education Minister Stephen Lecce has revealed nothing more than that school boards should plan on three scenarios : online classes ; full-time , in-class instruction ; or a hybrid model . Teachers inside the province \u2019 s largest school board in Toronto say they \u2019 ve not been given any guidance for the upcoming year . Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced Monday that many parts of Ontario will be moving to Stage 3 this week , allowing for bars and inside dining to resume , and angering parents who say that cases should be kept as low as possible to ensure a safe return to school .\nJohn Bailey , visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington , D.C. , and co-author of \u201c A blueprint for back to school , \u201d says some patience is due . \u201c I think opening a bar or restaurant is much simpler than opening a complex operation like a school , \u201d he says . The plans must reflect the fast-changing nature of the pandemic , which favors a wait-and-see approach , and address concerns of teachers and school staff fearful for their health .\nPolitics has only complicated the path forward . \u201c We just saw the tweets from Trump and [ Secretary of Education ] Betsy DeVos saying reopen schools fully in the fall . To me , that is politicizing something that shouldn \u2019 t be politicized \u2013 but I do think that outside of those politicized takes there \u2019 s this wishful thinking that we can return to normal in the fall , \u201d says Dr. Cohodes . \u201c We lost our window for that , if it ever existed . When we think about different options moving forward , I think what we have to remember is that we \u2019 re not comparing it to the school we knew , but a very changed experience . \u201d\nPlus , those who need school to open the most might be the least inclined to send their children back . Much attention has been paid to inequalities faced by minorities during the pandemic , from being overrepresented in frontline work , victim tallies , and among children in poor education outcomes . Yet Carycruz Bueno , a postdoctoral research associate at the Annenberg Institute for School Reform at Brown University , says minority students might find a school setting too risky . For example , Black and Latino families are more likely to have intergenerational households with grandparents living under the same roof , she says , so those families will need to make collective decisions about whether a child returning to school in person is good for the health of the home .\nDespite the complexities around reopening , many parents say it \u2019 s also impossible to ignore the gender aspect . The economic toll on women has been huge . In the U.S. , social norms and gender pay gaps mean that most likely it will be mothers who leave the workforce , says Dr . Powers . A study in Canada showed the pandemic exacerbating the gender employment gap , particularly among those with elementary-age children .\nColorado mom Amy Webb has 7- and 11-year-old sons and is also the founder of the Thoughtful Parent blog . She is grateful for the flexibility she has to work from home , unlike many parents . But it means readjusting her expectations as the only realistic way to juggle it all . \u201c I \u2019 m planning the lowest threshold of work I can do , \u201d she says .\nSociety is too accepting of this , says Ms. Hayward , the Newfoundland mom , exposing the fragility of women \u2019 s full equality when it comes to labor . \u201c When it comes down to brass tacks , that sort of support tends to fall away fairly quickly , \u201d she says .\nThe stigmas surrounding working mothers have also exacerbated the impossible choices women face now and kept some women from advocating for better solutions .\n\u201c As a mother , if I speak out and say , \u2018 You know , I need my child to go back to school in September , \u2019 there \u2019 s a worry for me that someone is going to say , \u2018 You \u2019 re willing to put your child at risk for your career , \u2019 \u201d Ms. Hayward says . \u201c And a lot of us have health worries , and we \u2019 re tired and we \u2019 re busy and we don \u2019 t have a voice left . We \u2019 ve really become so exhausted by all of this that the thought of advocating for one more thing has felt impossible . \u201d",
