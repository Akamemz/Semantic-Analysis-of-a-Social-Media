Where are you from ? \u201d\nDunning understood the woman wanted to know her ethnicity . But when she answered , \u201c Inuit , \u201d she got a blank stare . Finally , Dunning said , \u201c I \u2019 m Eskimo . \u201d\nShe dislikes the term , but caricatures of her ethnic group in popular culture , including food branding , make it the term non-Indigenous people know best . Eskimo Pie , which has been around since 1921 , features a smiling boy in a fur-lined parka on its packaging . The Canadian slurpee brand Cold Sucks also includes a parka-clad Inuit boy .\nThese depictions , Dunning asserts , lead strangers to believe that if Inuit individuals don \u2019 t have harpoons and eat raw meat , they \u2019 re inauthentic . \u201c We can never get away from that image , \u201d said Dunning , whose book , Eskimo Pie : A Poetics of Inuit Identity just debuted . \u201c We have to think about how these renderings of Indigenous people have a subconscious effect on the public imagination . \u201d\nHopefully , that \u2019 s about to change . In a statement last week to \u2588\u2588\u2588 , a spokesperson for Dreyer \u2019 s Grand Ice Cream said : \u201c We have been reviewing our Eskimo Pie business for some time and will be changing the brand name and marketing . We\u2026 recognize the term is derogatory . \u201d\nAs support for Black Lives Matter spreads across the globe , attention has turned to how stereotypical images of people of color are an inherent facet of mainstream culture , right down to our breakfast options . Prompted by this moment of national reckoning , Quaker announced last week it would remove the image and name of Aunt Jemima from its products because the character originated from a stereotype . This cued the parent companies of Cream of Wheat and Uncle Ben \u2019 s to announce they are also re-evaluating their imagery .\nNot everyone is pleased . In response to Eskimo Pie \u2019 s imminent name change , Donald Trump Jr tweeted : \u201c The bullshit never ends. \u201d But for people from ethnic groups that receive little other representation , in media or otherwise , these food rebrands could help change public perception about them \u2013 and stop reinforcing centuries-old stereotypes .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a part of the narrative that black people were happy as slaves and , then , later , as servants during the Jim Crow period , \u201d David Pilgrim said .\nFounder and curator at the Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia in Big Rapids , Michigan , Pilgrim educates visitors about artifacts that dehumanize people of color . Pilgrim , who is also vice president of diversity and inclusion at Ferris State University , says brands like Aunt Jemima not only stem from racial stereotypes but popularized them too . Aunt Jemima creator Charles Rutt used the name after seeing a minstrel show skit about a mammy called Jemima in the late 1800s ; he proceeded to use real-life black women to portray the character . Such figures would later appear in films such as 1934 \u2019 s Imitation of Life in which a black character gifts her pancake recipe to a white woman who becomes rich as a result . This storyline illustrates the insidiousness of the mammy \u2013 she doesn \u2019 t question her servitude or challenge the whites profiting from it .\nThe names Aunt Jemima and Uncle Ben trouble Pilgrim because they reflect how whites refused to call African Americans Mrs or Mr \u2013 titles they didn \u2019 t think black people deserved . But the name Rastus , the character on Cream of Wheat products , is even more offensive .\n\u201c It is a racist slur , \u201d he said . \u201c We don \u2019 t hear it much any more , but when you look at old racist jokes that appeared in newspapers and magazines , black characters were often named Rastus and portrayed as being barely intelligent . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s hard to comprehend the longevity of these characters , given their racist origins . Aunt Jemima and Uncle Ben have both undergone makeovers over the years to make them more palatable . The former got a headband to replace her kerchief in 1968 and was restyled as a \u201c young grandmother \u201d in 1989 , while the latter was rebranded as chairman of the board instead of a domestic servant in 2007 . But Americus Reed II , a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania \u2019 s Wharton School , said that Covid-19 and Black Lives Matter protests have given Americans time to reflect on their values and connect the dehumanizing branding of people of color to systemic inequality .\n\u201c In normal times , you don \u2019 t have the heightened consumer awareness that \u2019 s been triggered by Covid and George Floyd , \u201d Reed said . Economic instability and state lockdowns have made Americans pickier shoppers . This trend lines up with the racial awakening the nation is now undergoing , with customers threatening to boycott brands accused of racial discrimination . \u201c Making Aunt Jemima into a hip modern grandma could probably be tolerated ordinarily , \u201d Reed said . But after America reshapes in the wake of civil unrest and a pandemic , \u201c [ Brands ] basically have to change if they want consumers to come back to them . \u201d\nSocially conscious consumers may be inspiring food companies to rebrand , but don \u2019 t expect sports teams to follow suit . The longevity of racist mascots parallels the longevity of racist food branding and indicates the historic dehumanization of black and indigenous peoples in North America is interlinked .\n\u201c From our name , the Jim Crow museum , you wouldn \u2019 t know it , but we have hundreds of pieces which defame Native Americans , and there are lots of parallels , \u201d Pilgrim said . \u201c Any time we use racist portrayals of any group of people , it is harmful . \u201d\nAs Eskimo Pies are phased out , Dunning hopes that it will spark other changes , like Canadian football team the Edmonton Eskimos , for instance .
