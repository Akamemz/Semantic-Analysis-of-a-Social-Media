Where we \u2019 re seeing weaknesses in our economy have to do with the state and local governments . \u201d\nHe suggested GOP lawmakers are resisting his job-creation proposals because they \u2019 re motivated by election-year concerns .\n\u201c If Republicans want to be helpful , if they really want to move forward and put people back to work , what they should be thinking about is how do we help state and local governments and how do we help the construction industry , \u201d Mr. Obama said .\nWithin less than an hour , Mr. Romney and top Republicans on Capitol Hill were firing back .\nCampaigning in Iowa , Mr. Romney said Mr. Obama \u2019 s comment was \u201c an extraordinary miscalculation and misunderstanding . \u201d\n\u201c I think he \u2019 s defining what it means to be detached and out of touch with the American people , \u201d Mr. Romney said at an event in Council Bluffs , Iowa , pointing to the 23 million Americans who are unemployed or under-employed .\n\u201c For the president of the United States to stand up and say the private sector is doing fine is going to go down in history , \u201d he added .\nHouse GOP leaders also laughed off the president \u2019 s assertion that private industry is improving , citing in part a disappointing jobs report for May and national unemployment still above 8 percent .\n\u201c My question would be to the president : \u2018 Are you kidding ? \u2019 \u201d said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor , Virginia Republican . \u201c Did you see the job numbers that came out last week ? The private sector is not doing fine . \u201d\nLater in the day , Mr. Obama tried to clarify his comment .\n\u201c It \u2019 s absolutely clear the economy is not doing fine , \u201d Mr. Obama said while sitting next to Philippines President Benigno Aquino in the Oval Office . \u201c That \u2019 s the reason I had a press conference . That \u2019 s why I spent yesterday , the day before yesterday , this past week , this past month and this past year talking about how we can make the economy stronger . The economy is not doing fine . There are too many people out of work . The housing market is still weak , too many homes underwater and that \u2019 s precisely why I asked Congress to start taking some steps that can make a difference . And the question then is what are we going to do about it ? \u201d\nThe president said \u201c what I \u2019 m interested in hearing from Congress and Mr. Romney is what steps are they willing to take right now that are going to make an actual difference . And so far what we \u2019 ve heard are additional tax cuts that the folks who are doing fine as opposed to taking steps that would actually help deal with the weaknesses in the economy and promote the economic growth that we \u2019 d all like to see . \u201d\nHouse Republicans also pushed back at Mr. Obama \u2019 s criticism of lawmakers for not acting on his jobs initiative , saying it was Mr. Obama \u2019 s \u201c failed stimulus policies \u201d that had dragged the economy down .\n\u201c Frankly I \u2019 d ask the president to stop engaging in the blame game , \u201d said Mr. Cantor , who vowed that House Republicans will spend the summer \u201c directly focused on how we can make the environment better for small-business men and women to grow and create jobs in this country . \u201d\nHouse Speaker John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican , said next month he will hold a vote to extend current tax rates , a move he says would help create a better environment for job creation .\n\u201c With these looming tax hikes and the regulations coming out of Washington , we have frozen employers in place , \u201d he said .\nMr. Obama opened the press conference , which the White House announced about 90 minutes before it began , with a plea for Congress to approve parts of his $ 447 billion jobs package that lawmakers have already rejected . He said the \u201c unemployment rate would be lower , and our economy would be stronger \u201d today if Congress had adopted his proposals last fall .\n\u201c They left most of the jobs plan just sitting there , \u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201c I urge them to reconsider . \u201d\nBut Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , Kentucky Republican , said the president is fooling only himself with his assessment that the private sector is \u201c doing fine. \u201d He said Mr. Obama should work with the GOP on extending George W. Bush-era tax cuts for all Americans that are due to expire Dec. 31 .\n\u201c Whether the president wants to acknowledge it or not , we are now living in the Obama Economy , and no \u2018 Post-It Note \u2019 proposal can reverse the damage done by his policies over the past 3\u00bd years , \u201d Mr. McConnell said in a statement . \u201c It \u2019 s baffling that in the face of all evidence to the contrary , this president still believes that spending money we don \u2019 t have to inflate the government is the answer to America \u2019 s economic problems .
