    "content": "Students affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement crashed an event at the College of William & Mary , rushed the stage , and prevented the invited guest\u2014the American Civil Liberties Union 's Claire Gasta\u00f1aga , a W & M alum\u2014from speaking .\nIronically , Gasta\u00f1aga had intended to speak on the subject , `` Students and the First Amendment . ''\nThe disruption was livestreamed on BLM at W & M 's Facebook page . Students took to the stage just a few moments after Gasta\u00f1aga began her remarks . At first , she attempted to spin the demonstration as a welcome example of the kind of thing she had come to campus to discuss , commenting `` Good , I like this , '' as they lined up and raised their signs . `` I 'm going to talk to you about knowing your rights , and protests and demonstrations , which this illustrates very well . Then I 'm going to respond to questions from the moderators , and then questions from the audience . ''\nIt was the last remark she was able to make before protesters drowned her out with cries of , `` ACLU , you protect Hitler , too . '' They also chanted , `` the oppressed are not impressed , '' `` shame , shame , shame , shame , '' ( an ode to the Faith Militant 's treatment of Cersei Lannister in Game of Thrones , though why anyone would want to be associated with the religious fanatics in that particular conflict is beyond me ) , `` blood on your hands , '' `` the revolution will not uphold the Constitution , '' and , uh , `` liberalism is white supremacy . ''\nThis went on for nearly 20 minutes . Eventually , according to the campus 's Flat Hat News , one of the college 's co-organizers of the event handed a microphone to the protest 's leader , who delivered a prepared statement . The disruption was apparently payback for the ACLU 's principled First Amendment defense of the Charlottesville alt-right 's civil liberties .\nOrganizers then canceled the event ; some members of the audience approached the podium in an attempt to speak with Gasta\u00f1aga , but the protesters would not permit it . They surrounded Gasta\u00f1aga , raised their voices even louder , and drove everybody else away .\nThe college released what can only be described as an incredibly tepid statement :\nWilliam & Mary has a powerful commitment to the free play of ideas . We have a campus where respectful dialogue , especially in disagreement , is encouraged so that we can listen and learn from views that differ from our own , so that we can freely express our own views , and so that debate can occur . Unfortunately , that type of exchange was unable to take place Wednesday night when an event to discuss a very important matter \u2013 the meaning of the First Amendment \u2014 could not be held as planned . \u2026 Silencing certain voices in order to advance the cause of others is not acceptable in our community . This stifles debate and prevents those who 've come to hear a speaker , our students in particular , from asking questions , often hard questions , and from engaging in debate where the strength of ideas , not the power of shouting , is the currency . William & Mary must be a campus that welcomes difficult conversations , honest debate and civil dialogue .\nAbsent a promise to identify the perpetrators and make sure this never happens again , the college 's statement is meaningless . If officials are just going to stand by while students make it impossible to even have a conversation about free speech on campus , the matter is already settled : there is no free speech at William & Mary .\nThese students have clearly made up their minds about free speech : they do n't want to share it with anyone else\u2014especially Nazis , but also civil liberties lawyers who happen to be experts on the thing they are willfully misunderstanding : the First Amendment .
