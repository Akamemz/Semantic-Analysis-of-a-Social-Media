    "content": "Some suggest that Congress \u201c remove Trump from office , so that he can not abuse incumbency to subvert the electoral process , but let the American people make the judgment on whether or not he gets a second term\u2026 Removing Trump from office for the remainder of his term would disable him from abusing presidential power again and protect the integrity of the electoral process from inappropriate interference . At the same time , letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump , despite his attempt to subvert the system , should have another chance\u2026 Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus . As long as Trump can run again , Republicans can not hide behind a claim that they are [ the ] ones protecting voter choice by opposing impeachment. \u201d Edward B. Foley , Politico\n\u201c The fundamental injustice of climate change is that\u2026 many of the wealthiest countries in the world have historically emitted the most greenhouse gas emissions , but the poorest who contributed least to the problem stand to suffer the most . That includes island nations like the Bahamas facing rising seas and fiercer storms like Hurricane Dorian , or countries in Southeast Asia suffering from extreme heat waves\u2026 The UN has created a number of mechanisms to help correct this discrepancy\u2026 it \u2019 s worth paying attention to see how much more developed economies are willing to contribute to these programs. \u201d Umair Irfan , Vox\nOthers note that \u201c The Chinese government has [ already ] pledged more than $ 1 trillion dollars in air , water , and soil cleanup plans , shuttered coal mines throughout the country , capped coal consumption , established a nationwide carbon trading system , poured hundreds of billions of dollars\u2014more than any other country in the world by far\u2014in renewable energy , and promoted the manufacture and sale of electric-vehicles\u2026 China has set itself an ambitious agenda . It will not be readily realized . But China , at least , is in the climate game and moving forward\u2026 It \u2019 s past time for the U.S. to step up. \u201d Daniel K. Gardner , New Republic\nFormer secretary of state John Kerry states , \u201c The need for leadership has never been more urgent ; certainly the destruction from Hurricane Dorian and the fires in the Amazon should have refocused everyone \u2019 s minds on the fragility of our global carbon sinks . Most wars start with a bomb dropped , a leader killed or a line crossed . But today we stand on the precipice of the greatest battle humanity has ever faced , precisely because no one has done enough\u2026 In the temporary absence of U.S. leadership , we need other major emitters to step up \u2026 now is the time for China , India and other countries to prove just what we are missing. \u201d John Kerry , Washington Post\nFormer vice president Al Gore writes , \u201c We have the technology we need\u2026 For example , according to the research group Bloomberg New Energy Finance , as recently as 2014 \u2014 a year before the Paris climate agreement was reached \u2014 electricity from solar and wind was cheaper than new coal and gas plants in probably 1 percent of the world . Today , only five years later , solar and wind provide the cheapest sources of new electricity in two-thirds of the world\u2026 To pick [ another ] example , Google has reduced the amount of electricity required to cool its enormous server farms by 40 percent using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence . No new hardware was required\u2026 \u201c [ But ] we don \u2019 t have the right policies because the wrong policymakers are in charge \u2026 Next year \u2019 s election is the crucial test of the nation \u2019 s commitment to addressing this crisis , and it is worth remembering that on the day after the 2020 election , the terms of the Paris climate accord will permit the United States to withdraw from it . We can not allow that to happen. \u201d Al Gore , New York Times\n\u201c Some might criticize Greta and her fellow climate crusaders as zealots or as short sighted , just as many said that about the Parkland students . But even if one disagrees with their proposed solutions , do n't dismiss the power of children in the streets -- calling for change -- to create an impetus for action . At least once before [ in the civil rights era ] , a children 's movement was a core inspiration for our country to address its greatest injustices . Today , the young speak with moral clarity again. \u201d David Gergen and James Piltch , CNN\n\u201c The rate of climate change now vastly exceeds anything observed in the last ten thousand years . Since roughly 1850 , atmospheric CO2 , the dominant greenhouse gas , has grown at an explosive rate , close to what mathematicians call \u2018 exponential. \u2019 Human population , GDP and fossil fuel emissions accelerated simultaneously in a similar manner\u2026 doubling of CO2 from preindustrial levels , which is projected by 2075 \u2014 due to the combination of industrial emissions and huge volumes of ancient greenhouse gases rising from melting permafrost \u2013 will put the earth at CO2 levels not seen for 35 million years , the last time that Antarctica was ice-free\u2026 \u201c In a fleeting moment of geological time , humanity has fundamentally changed the earth system , bringing life-changing consequences. \u201d John Brooke , Michael Bevis and Steve Rissing , Time\nThe right is critical of the protests and skeptical of excessively pessimistic predictions about climate change .\nThe right is critical of the protests and skeptical of excessively pessimistic predictions about climate change .\n\u201c San Diego \u2019 s school board should be more concerned with educating its students than canceling classes to send little kids to fill a picket line in support of a partisan agenda\u2026 a 2018 assessment of California student performance shows 43.65 % of San Diego Unified School District \u2019 s students don \u2019 t meet standards in English Language Arts/Literacy and 52.84 % don \u2019 t meet standards in math . Sounds to me like San Diego \u2019 s kids should be in class ! That \u2019 s what we pay for as taxpayers , not political activism . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s not much of a \u2018 strike \u2019 if The Man is practically begging you to \u2018 resist. \u2019 And in this case it \u2019 s not just [ New York City \u2019 s ] mayor tweeting out his support for the rally , or the DOE declaring the Battery Park affair to be a \u2018 civic event \u2019 and the student strike as \u2018 principled truancy. \u2019 It \u2019 s also the regular curriculum . \u201d\n\u201c Human-driven climate change is a real problem . But anyone with sense understands that it 's a problem to be dealt with through technological improvements that reduce carbon emissions and also protect living standards . It is n't about meaningless international treaties such as the Paris accord , which allow major polluters such as China and India to do nothing on carbon emissions , leave the European Union to do little , and mostly just burden America ( which has in most recent years led the world in carbon reductions ) \u2026\n\u201c When you start instructing people to stop eating meat and flying for vacations , the majority rightly view that as a nonstarter . Such suggestions close off all serious policy debate before the discussion even begins . They show that climate change advocacy is just a cover for an unrelated far-left ideology . \u201d\nThe Youth Climate Strike manifesto includes \u201c progressive reforms that relate to climate change only as a result of a stretch of the imagination . Among them , the creation of state-owned banks , affordable housing , \u2018 local living-wage jobs \u2019 and \u2018 fully paid quality health care \u2019 for affected populations\u2026 The climate strike is all about indoctrination , not science . \u201d\nMany argue that \u201c before anyone is tempted to start believing any of these predictions [ about climate change ] , it \u2019 s worth recalling that similar predictions of impending environmental doom have been made regularly for the past half-century\u2026 Paul Ehrlich , who became famous with publication of The Population Bomb in 1968 , regularly predicted global mass starvation by the 1970s and 1980s because of overpopulation and resource depletion . In 1970 , Ehrlich predicted that the oceans would be dead in less than a decade , that Americans would face water rationing by 1974 and food rationing by 1980\u2026\n\u201c James Hansen of NASA \u2019 s Goddard Institute of Space Studies beginning in 1988 predicted major droughts and up to six feet of sea level rise in the 1990s\u2026 Al Gore predicted in 2009 that the North Pole would be completely ice free in five years . A U.S. Navy scientist in 2013 concluded that the Arctic \u2019 s summer sea ice cover would all be melted by 2016\u2026 After 50 years of misinformed , misguided , and mistaken predictions , is there any reason to believe that the current prophecies of global warming apocalypse are likely to come true ? \u201d\nOthers propose a \u201c plan [ that ] is based on the concept of carbon dividends : a gradually rising fee on all carbon emissions , whose proceeds are returned directly to the American people through quarterly dividend checks . It also calls for significantly simplifying carbon regulations and a border carbon adjustment to protect and promote the competitiveness of American firms\u2026 if implemented in 2021 the plan would achieve 50 % U.S. CO2 reduction by 2035 , as compared with 2005 levels . It would also exceed the 2025 U.S. commitment under the Paris agreement by a wide margin\u2026\n\u201c The vast majority of Americans will be economic winners under our plan . According to the U.S. Treasury , 70 % of American families\u2014including the most vulnerable\u2014would come out ahead , receiving more in carbon dividends than they pay in increased energy costs\u2026 And the more you shrink your carbon footprint , the more you come out ahead . This aligns\u2014for the first time\u2014the economic interests of American families with climate progress . \u201d\nOthers note , \u201c I \u2019 d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame . The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by , for instance , mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels . Trump \u2019 s conversation is typically scattershot , wandering all over the field , leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be\u2026 \u200d \u201c I think Joe Sixpack \u2019 s response is going to be a hearty shrug .
