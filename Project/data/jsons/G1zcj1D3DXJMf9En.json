    "content": "According to Gallup , the average presidential honeymoon lasts seven months . This is a window when the losing party declares a partisan peace , allows the incoming president to pick his cabinet and launch the agenda his victory mandates . Presidential honeymoons are not only a venerable American tradition they are one of democracy \u2019 s pillars . For generations they have been ceremonial supports for the peaceful transition of power , and the peaceful resolution of partisan conflicts .\nNot this election year . There will be no honeymoon . This year even before Trump arrives in the Oval Office , the opposition cry has been Resist ! Block ! Reject ! It is not just anti-American radicals like Michael Moore , who has indeed called for \u201c 100 days of resistance \u201d to the Trump presidency , but by the leadership of the Democratic Party which has vowed to fight Trump \u2019 s appointments , has attacked the election result as an expression of popular racism , attempted to discredit the Electoral College by falsely calling it a legacy of slavery , and even accused Trump of being a Russian agent , a pawn in the chess game of its dictator Vladimir Putin . It is a sad day for America when the world \u2019 s oldest political party , whose name proclaims it a partisan of democracy , comes out in force as a saboteur of that same system .\nNor is all this simply a fit of Democratic absent-mindedness . Instead , it is the culmination of a long developing shift in Democratic Party politics , a shift symbolized by the current favorite to become its next leader . Keith Ellison is a Muslim radical who spent his formative adult years as a vocal supporter of the anti-American , anti-Semitic racist Louis Farrakhan . Ellison reflects the power of the Bernie Sanders radicals in the Democratic Party who according to recent Gallup polls now represent its majority , even though they lost a rigged primary election which would have made him the party \u2019 s presidential nominee .\nThe face of this new Democratic Party was revealed during a seminal moment in the second Clinton-Trump presidential debate . It came when Trump turned to the cameras and said , \u201c Hillary has tremendous hatred in her heart. \u201d He was referring to her now notorious statement that half of Trump \u2019 s supporters belonged in a \u201c basket of deplorables , \u201d which was followed by her iteration of those she had in mind : \u201c The racist , sexist , homophobic , xenophobic , Islamophobic\u2014you name it . And unfortunately there are people like that . And he has lifted them up . \u201d\nWhat made this moment pivotal was that the slurs were not an idiosyncratic tic of the Democratic standard-bearer and leader of the party \u2019 s \u201c moderate \u201d wing . They were the logical expression of the identity politics that had become the party \u2019 s creed . If every political issue and conflict is reduced to a conflict of races , genders and ethnic origins this inevitably leads to the demonization of the opposition as racist , sexist \u2026 deplorable . It is this mentality that has swallowed the Democratic Party and caused it to view politics not as an art of compromise but as a war against the indecent and the irredeemable . There can be no more succinct summary of what the Democrats \u2019 rejection of the traditional presidential honeymoon is about .\nNonetheless , what was most significant in the presidential debate was Trump \u2019 s readiness to confront Hillary to her face and describe her attack for what it was : hate . It was the kind of indiscreet character description that had become a signature reflex of Trump \u2019 s campaign . Never before had one presidential candidate so bluntly confronted another . Never had any Republican dared to characterize a Democratic opponent in such damning moral terms before a national audience .\nThis why the attempt to reverse the election result , block Trump \u2019 s appointments and cripple his agendas will fail . Other Republicans faced with such extreme attacks on their appointments would have thrown many of them under the bus . But Trump himself has been the target of such attacks from the outset of his campaign . The reason he has been so attacked has been his readiness to confront head on what is called \u201c political correctness \u201d but what is in fact a party line demonizing anyone who challenges it as a racist , sexist , Islamophobic \u2014 deplorable .\nThis is the revolution that Trump represents . It will succeed or fail on whether the American people are ready to reject the racial , gender and ethnic divisiveness that has become the policy of the Democratic Party ; whether they are ready to restore the American social contract that regards individuals on their merits , regardless of race , color or creed .
