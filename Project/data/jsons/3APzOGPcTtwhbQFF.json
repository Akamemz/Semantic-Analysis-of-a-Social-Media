They then compare that to the think-tank research that elected officials cite when they talk on the House or Senate floor , to calibrate where the media fits relative to the Congress . They find some interesting answers : most of the media does have a liberal bias ( throwing out the editorial page , the Wall Street Journal is the most liberal of all , even beating the New York Times ! ) . Fox News is one of the few outlets that is right of center .\nHere \u2019 s how 20 major media outlets rank on Groseclose and Milyo \u2019 s slant scale , with 100 representing the most liberal and zero the most conservative :\nABC Good Morning America 56.1 ABC World News Tonight 61.0 CBS Early Show 66.6 CBS Evening News 73.7 CNN NewsNight with Aaron Brown 56.0 Drudge Report 60.4 Fox News Spec .
