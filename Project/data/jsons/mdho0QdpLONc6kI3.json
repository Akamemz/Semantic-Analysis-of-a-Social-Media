Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Govs . Susana Martinez of New Mexico , Nikki Haley of South Carolina and maybe even Sarah Palin of Alaska .\nOn the Democratic side , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Massachusetts Senate nominee Elizabeth Warren would be serious contenders , regardless of whether Obama wins or loses .\n`` We have all heard rumors about women running at the top of the ticket of both parties for 2016 , '' says Linda Young , president of the National Women 's Political Caucus . `` We do not have any concrete commitment by anyone yet for those races . ''\nBut despite all of the possible female candidates waiting in the wings , many political observers express doubt that a woman will be elected \u2014 or even nominated to be \u2014 president in the near future .\nWhich is weird . Because in just about every other aspect of American life , women are taking over .\nCheck the stats : According to the latest census figures , there are more women than men in the United States . More women earn college degrees and graduate degrees than men , the University of Minnesota reports .\nIn many places of cultural import where women are not in power , the trend is in their favor . In 1990 , for example , only 36 percent of medical school graduates were female ; in 2011 , more than 48 percent were female , according to a Catalyst survey . For the past 10 years , the Women 's Media Center finds , women have outpaced men by at least 2 to 1 among journalism and mass communications majors .\nWomen are making gains in the workplace . In 2012 , there are more female CEOs running Fortune 500 companies than ever before . `` There 's a pipeline of women coming into leadership positions that 's very , very deep and very , very wide , '' Fortune 's executive editor , Stephanie Mehta , told The Huffington Post . `` There are women sitting just below the CEO position at these Fortune 500 companies and many of them are poised to lead Fortune 500 companies when there are openings and movement . ''\nBusinesswomen beget more businesswomen . According to Catalyst , a pro-business organization for women , `` companies with more women in top leadership positions , on average , far outperform those with fewer and ... companies with more women board directors are likelier to have more women corporate officers five years later . ''\nIn the policymaking arena , female politicians beget more of the same . In 1979 , only 3 percent of those in Congress were women ; in 2012 , nearly 17 percent of those in Congress are women . The proportion of women in statewide elective offices has also increased from 11 percent in 1979 to more than 23 percent in 2012 , the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University tells us .\nMoreover , the center notes , female voters rule in presidential elections , as well . In every presidential election since 1964 , there have been more female voters than male voters . And since 1980 , `` the proportion of eligible female adults who voted has exceeded the proportion of eligible male adults who voted . ''\nThat is not to say that women tend to vote more for women than for men . That is not always the case . But if there are more women than men in this country and there are more women in powerful positions in colleges and corporations , the chances of a female candidate being nominated and elected naturally increase .\nBut is America ready for a female president ? Apparently so . Way back in 2006 , more than 60 percent of Americans , Gallup News Service reported , thought the United States was ready for a female president .\nLess than 60 percent , by the way , thought the country was ready for an African-American president . Now that Obama has broken one barrier , perhaps a female candidate will break another in a coming contest .\nWomen are looking for new leaders . According to a recent report by Generation Opportunity \u2014 a nonpartisan think tank focusing on the economics of young Americans \u2014 fewer than 40 percent of women surveyed say that elected officials represent their interests . And nearly 80 percent plan to vote on Nov. 6 .\nBut even if women are looking to other women to better represent them , proponents of female representation say there are just not enough potential candidates . There are significantly more women running for office in 2012 than before , says Linda Young . But `` women still do not represent even close to an equal number of men candidates . ''\nAccording to stats from the National Women 's Political Caucus , there are 18 women from the major parties running for Senate in 15 races in 2012 . That boils down to 27 percent of all candidates in 45 percent of the races \u2014 leaving men with 73 percent of candidates and with at least one man running in 91 percent of the races . Women make up only 18.7 percent of the House candidates .\nFor years the National Women 's Political Caucus has called for gender equality in federal offices . The slogan has been `` 50/50 by 2020 .

''\nShe is heartened by some signs . `` We have seen women in higher positions politically in the U.S. , as we fairly recently saw a woman serve as speaker of the House [ Nancy Pelosi , 2007-2011 ] , and we have had women serve in Cabinet positions for quite a number of years . What we have not seen is a woman at the top of our national government . ''\nMeanwhile , in many other countries , including Argentina , Australia , Germany , Iceland , Liberia and Switzerland , women hold top leadership positions .\nSo will a woman be nominated for president next time around ? `` To me it will just take the right woman , rather than just any woman , '' says Monika L.

Pat Schroeder of Colorado . `` Hillary Clinton is the one woman I could see being able to run and make it . ... There are a lot of women running this year . Hopefully some will make it and move up .
