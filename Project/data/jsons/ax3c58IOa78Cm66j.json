Ted Cruz ( R-TX ) told a local radio show in California on Monday morning that the Drudge Report , the most popular conservative news website , has \u201c become the attack site for the Donald Trump campaign . \u201d\nCruz was interview on The Mike Slater Show on KFMB 760 AM . Host Mike Slater asked Cruz ( 15:16 ) , \u201c What do you think of Drudge Report lately ? Not even about Trump , but their anti-Christian headlines ? \u201d\nLook , Drudge Report over the years has done a good job highlighting the excesses of the left and the excesses of liberalism , and about the past month the Drudge Report has basically become the attack site for the Donald Trump campaign . And so every day they have the latest Trump attack . They \u2019 re directed at me . It \u2014 by all appearances , Roger Stone now decides what \u2019 s on Drudge , and most days they have a six-month-old article that is some attack on me , and it \u2019 s \u2014 whatever the Trump campaign is pushing that day will be the banner headline on Drudge . By the way , they no longer cover news . Remember they used to have things like election results ? They don \u2019 t put those on Drudge anymore . When we win a state , suddenly the state doesn \u2019 t matter . You know Colorado \u2014 there was no red siren on Drudge when we won all 34 delegates in Colorado . That wasn \u2019 t news , because \u2014 I mean listen , that \u2019 s fine . If people want to get on the \u201c Trump train , \u201d they can . I actually think we need real and meaningful solutions to the problems in this country , and as president my focus is going to be on three things : jobs , freedom and security . My number one priority is bringing jobs back to America , raising wages for everyone , making it easier for people struggling to achieve the American Dream . That \u2019 s my focus . I \u2019 m going to let others worry about the silly political game and the circus .\nSlater returned to talking about Drudge : \u201c I \u2019 ve always thought it interesting when the debate is still going on and and they \u2019 ll put a poll up , who won the debate . It \u2019 s literally in the middle of the debate , and they say who won the debate \u2014 and then Trump walks off the stage and says , \u2018 Well , everyone says I won \u2019 \u2026 \u201d .\nCruz took the focus off of talking about Drudge to focus on Trump :\nWell I will say this , Mike : actions speak louder than words . Donald is terrified to debate . He won \u2019 t debate anymore . He \u2019 s just , he \u2019 s skipping all the debates , and the reason is he liked it when there were 10 or 11 people on stage because he didn \u2019 t have to speak very much , and all of the bickering dominated everything . Now that it is down to one-on-one , me and Donald Trump , and one or the other of us is going to be the nominee , there are only two people with any plausible path to winning a majority of the delegates , and that is either me or Donald Trump \u2014 and , by the way , California is going to decide it . California , for the first time in decades , matters in the Republican primary .\nOn Sunday , the Drudge Report carried several headlines regarding the Colorado Republican Party \u2019 s delegate selection process .\nWhen asked , Cruz said that he did not expect that the primary would be decided by California as of a year ago , \u201c but nobody anticipated Donald Trump . Donald Trump is a unique , you know , it is a reality star , substanceless , attack and cursing and personal insults . You know , I don \u2019 t think that \u2019 s what politics should be about .
