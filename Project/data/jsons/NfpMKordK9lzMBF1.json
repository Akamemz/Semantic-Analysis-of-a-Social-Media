On Thursday , he said he \u201c never had meetings with Russian operatives or Russian intermediaries \u201d about the campaign . Yet a Trump administration official told CNBC \u2019 s John Harwood that Mr . Sessions had talked about the election with the ambassador , if only in \u201c superficial \u201d terms .\nMr . Sessions is the latest administration official to be caught between his words and the truth on Russia . Just a few weeks ago , the president fired Michael Flynn , his national security adviser , for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about his contacts with the Russian ambassador .\nMr. Sessions \u2019 s recusal is only a first necessary step . The second must be the appointment of a special counsel \u2014 an independent , nonpartisan actor who can both investigate and prosecute any criminal acts in relation to Russian interference , whether by Mr . Sessions or anyone else . That \u2019 s the only way an investigation can have credibility with the public . Simply shifting investigative authority to one of Mr. Sessions \u2019 s deputies , who report to him on all other matters , would do nothing to cure the underlying conflict .\nRepublican leaders in Congress also need to establish a bipartisan select committee to investigate whether the Trump campaign had a role in Russia \u2019 s election interference . Intelligence committees in both houses of Congress have said they will begin their own investigations , but those are run by the likes of Devin Nunes , chairman of the House Intelligence Committee .
