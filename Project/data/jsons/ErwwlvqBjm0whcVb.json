    "content": "It was a quiet meeting on the eve of a political explosion .\nAt 4 p.m. on Wednesday , 30 or so members of the 2012 GOP freshman class of the House of Representatives gathered in a conference room in the Capitol Visitor Center for what \u2019 s become a monthly conclave . For the junior representatives , this was a chance to get some face time with Speaker John Boehner ( R-Ohio ) . Everyone knew that the next evening , President Barack Obama planned to deliver an in-your-face rebuke to Boehner , who \u2019 d warned the president not to \u201c play with matches \u201d and act on his own to suspend deportation of millions of immigrants .\nAll of those gathered had reason to be angry : Here was the president pretending , absurdly , that he hadn \u2019 t just had his butt whipped in the midterms , and defying the biggest GOP House majority-to-come in more than 80 years . Almost exactly a year before , some in the room had been among the most vocal Republicans pushing for a government shutdown as a legislative strategy against Obama .\nBut now came a stern message from Boehner : The GOP shouldn \u2019 t take the bait this time . And as discussion moved around the table , there was little desire for another shutdown , even from the conservatives , over the president \u2019 s executive action on immigration . No one wanted to let Democrats off the mat and hand them a political win \u2014 especially not now , barely two weeks after the GOP \u2019 s historic midterm victory . \u201c There was definitely a sense that they didn \u2019 t want to do that [ the 2013 shutdown ] again , \u201d said an aide to one of the participants .\nOutwardly , Republican rhetoric toward the president hasn \u2019 t softened much , especially since Obama \u2019 s speech Thursday night . The consistent meme is that he is behaving like an unconstitutional monarch .\n\u201c The president has taken actions that he himself has said are those of a \u2018 king \u2019 or an \u2018 emperor \u2019 \u2014 not an American president , \u201d Boehner said in a statement the morning after the speech . \u201c With this action , the president has chosen to deliberately sabotage any chance of enacting bipartisan reforms that he claims to seek . And , as I told the president yesterday , he \u2019 s damaging the presidency itself . \u201d\nWhat has changed is the underlying balance of power in the party and , perhaps , the terms of debate within the GOP over how to deal with the Democratic Party and its surprisingly aggressive leader . Obama might be behaving like a usurping monarch without a mandate , in the eyes of the newly powerful GOP , but no one is seriously threatening to impeach him \u2014 as Republicans have repeatedly done in past years . Nor , despite the angry rhetoric , does there seem to be a serious possibility of government shutdown .\nYes , outliers are still threatening actions that could lead to a stalemate a la 2013 : Arizona Rep. Matt Salmon , voicing anger against the executive action in a way that typified many Southern and Western Republicans , called the move an \u201c impeachable offense , \u201d and earlier circulated a letter urging House Appropriations chairman Hal Rogers ( R-Ky. ) to defund any presidential effort to supply work permits or green cards to illegals \u2014 potentially prompting a veto and a shutdown . The more than 50 representatives who signed the Salmon letter included many of the same House members who adopted the strategy in 2013 that led to a shutdown then .\nAnd yet Rogers and the House leadership , as well as a substantial portion of the Republican caucus , have made it clear they \u2019 re not ready to take that course again . \u201c People are being very thoughtful about this , \u201d said Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn , who is widely seen as a rising star in tea party circles . \u201c I \u2019 ve heard no one mention a shutdown except the press . \u201d\nCall it thoughtfulness \u2014 or call it confusion . All in all , the mild , somewhat subdued response to Obama \u2019 s immigration move is evidence that the uncompromising GOP insurgency that so paralyzed Washington in 2013 has lost some potency .\nEven some of the House \u2019 s most conservative members have little appetite for a government shutdown , saying that while they \u2019 re determined to level sharp criticism against the president , they \u2019 re not thinking about going much further than that . According to the head of a national , GOP-aligned Republican group , party leaders strongly suspect that Obama is trying to goad conservatives into throwing a fit : \u201c I think the president is counting on a Republican overreaction , where it really takes over the agenda of the new Congress . \u2026 I think this president is counting on an overreach . \u201d\nApart from announcing on Friday a lawsuit against the White House over two elements of Obamacare \u2014 waiving the employer mandate and transferring funds to insurance companies \u2014 the GOP is going home for the Thanksgiving recess without a real plan or response . In an interview , GOP Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma , a Boehner ally and former National Republican Congressional Committee chairman , essentially conceded that his party \u2019 s hands were tied legislatively for the moment . He said Boehner and incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are currently in talks about what to do , and he highlighted a border security bill and visa reform as possible options .\nCole also said he \u2019 d like to focus on getting an omnibus spending package approved . \u201c From a strategic political standpoint , I think we \u2019 re better off establishing stability , \u201d He said . \u201c I don \u2019 t think we want to do something that plays into the president \u2019 s hands and hurts us , especially after last year \u2019 s experience with shutdowns and showdowns . \u2026 When your opponent sets a bear trap for you , you don \u2019 t respond by stepping into it . \u201d\nFormer House Deputy Whip Peter Roskam ( R-Ill. ) also believes the days of severe brinkmanship with the White House have passed , and that his colleagues are eyeing a more measured , strategic approach to squeeze the president . If Obama won \u2019 t negotiate , says Roskam , the GOP will cast him as the obstructionist .\n\u201c Is it a shutdown strategy ? I don \u2019 t think so . But I think you \u2019 re going to see a longer-term thoughtful strategy on the appropriations side to push back very , very hard against the White House , \u201d he said .\nIf Obama doesn \u2019 t back down on his immigration plan , Roskam said appropriators could attach \u201c limitations amendments \u201d to spending measures without threatening shutdown , forcing the president to decide whether he \u2019 ll derail other major programs to preserve his executive order . \u201c The vast areas of connection between the president \u2019 s action and the appropriations process [ create ] many opportunities , \u201d he said . \u201c You shift the burden and then force the discussion by passing some thoughtful , targeted appropriations bills . Is Barack Obama going to be the person who grinds this all to a halt over his immigration policies ? \u201d\nAlso leery of too much confrontation are some incoming GOP freshmen .\nTom MacArthur , the Republican who will represent New Jersey \u2019 s 3rd Congressional District next year , called Obama \u2019 s action \u201c just outrageous \u201d and he declined to rule out measures that would shutter the government , but he emphasized that any solution should be bipartisan and called the president \u2019 s maneuver \u201c an opportunity for both parties to work together. \u201d Lee Zeldin , who will represent a Long Island House district in the next term , played down the importance of the executive order , saying it was just a distraction . \u201c Instead of discussing tax reform and improving our nation \u2019 s energy policy and improving the business policy , everybody \u2019 s talking about his executive order , \u201d he said . Zeldin too declined to endorse a specific response to Obama \u2019 s immigration action .\nThe immigration issue , of course , is also about the reckoning of 2016 , which is a lot closer than it was during the shutdown crisis . With the race for the White House rapidly approaching , a growing number of Republicans are concerned about alienating Latinos , whom many in the GOP see as a natural constituency .\nIn 2014 , Latino turnout was seen as low across many crucial races . But that \u2019 s likely not to be the case in a presidential election . In 2012 , Obama amassed an astonishing 71 percent of the Hispanic vote to 27 percent for Mitt Romney , who had declared during the primaries that he would make it harder for the 11 million illegal immigrants in the U.S. to get jobs , leading them to \u201c self-deport. \u201d Party leaders legitimately fear a kind of demographic death for the GOP if it doesn \u2019 t find a way to appease the burgeoning Hispanic population , particularly since the 2010 census showed , for the first time , that white births are now a minority in the United States .\nSome influential conservatives are outraged by what they see as the latest GOP retreat in Washington . Steve Deace , a radio host based in Iowa , said the midterm elections gave Republicans a mandate \u201c to stop Obama \u201d and that the party \u2019 s elected leaders can \u2019 t be \u201c a bunch of Republican squishes \u201d when it comes to the looming immigration battle . \u201c John Boehner is the third in line to the most powerful office on planet Earth . That is his job , \u201d he said . \u201c It \u2019 s Mitch McConnell \u2019 s .
