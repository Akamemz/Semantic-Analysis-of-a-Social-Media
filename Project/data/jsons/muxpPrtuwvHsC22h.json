An opposition newspaper there, Cumhuriyet, printed a special section of excerpts from the Charlie Hebdo edition.\n\nIt printed small, black-and-white versions of the cover in two of its columns, but did not use the image in the special section itself, after \u201cmany consultations,\u201d its editor in chief Utku Cakirozer said on Twitter.\n\nPolice cordoned off its Istanbul headquarters over security concerns and searched trucks leaving its printing press. At the paper\u2019s Ankara offices, protesters hung banners on a nearby wall that read: \u201cThe Charlie provocation continues.\u201d\n\nA Turkish court ordered some website pages that reproduced the Charlie Hebdo cover image to be blocked.\n\nNews website T24, nevertheless, ran the image on its site.\n\n\u201cThis became a clear freedom of expression issue and no longer about religious sentiments. We published this to defend the values of free expression,\u201d its editor, Hazal Ozvaris, told Reuters.\n\nHATEFUL FRIVOLITY\n\nSuch attitudes were rare in the region. In Iran, a leading conservative cleric, Grand Ayatollah Nasser Makarem-Shirazi, said the publication of new satirical images of Mohammad \u201camounts to declaring war on all Muslims\u201d.\n\nEgypt\u2019s Al-Azhar, a thousand-year-old seat of Islamic learning that has described the Paris attack as a criminal act, called on Muslims to ignore the magazine\u2019s cartoons, labelling them \u201chateful frivolity\u201d.\n\nSaudi cleric Iyad Ameen Madani, Secretary General of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, denounced the new cartoon as \u201cinsolence, ignorance and foolishness\u201d.\n\n\u201cFreedom of speech must not become hate-speech,\u201d he said. \u201cNo sane person, regardless of doctrine, religion or faith, accepts his beliefs being ridiculed.\u201d\n\nMany people on the streets in the Middle East said it was time to move on.\n\n\u201cThe cartoons have no meaning, they should not affect us.
