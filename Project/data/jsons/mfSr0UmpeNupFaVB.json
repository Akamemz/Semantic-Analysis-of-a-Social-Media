They want to understand what we think it takes to get everything moving again , '' Rep. Josh Gottheimer , D-N.J. , co-chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus , told Fox News .\nThe Problem Solvers Caucus on Monday will unveil publicly its `` Back to Work '' checklist that is poised to be an influential framework in Washington in future rounds of coronavirus relief packages . The plan got the green light from the group of pragmatic lawmakers determined to deliver Americans some relief .\n`` What this checklist does is it shows that if you 're sincere and you want to put partisan politics aside ... you can actually roll up your sleeves and you can find some common ground that makes a lot of good common sense , '' Rep. Tom Reed , R-N.Y. , co-chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus , told Fox News . `` It also shows that you can get the necessary votes at 218 and 60 to get it done [ in the House and Senate . ] ''\nTRUMP UNVEILS CORONAVIRUS GUIDELINES FOR ROLLING BACK SOCIAL DISTANCING IN PHASES : \u2018 NEXT FRONT IN OUR WAR \u2019\nThe White House already released its plan for a three-phased gradual opening led by states , but it was panned by some governors and Speaker Nancy Pelosi as being too vague and not stressing mass rapid testing and contact tracing .\nBut at the top of the list for bipartisan lawmakers ' checklist is the importance of rapid mass COVID-19 testing -- at a scale that could be upwards of five times greater than what 's currently happening . The Problem Solvers Caucus checklist calls for establishing a federal contact tracing database , similar to how the federal government already tracks measles .\nThe lawmakers say the supply chain for personal protective gear also needs to ramp up to cover workers in all essential sectors , from food service to schools . Their checklist calls for all K-12 children and teachers having access to protective masks to return to school .\n`` In the short run , we need to do it to get our schools back open , '' Gottheimer said of having teachers and students wear masks . `` That 's part of the precaution we 're going to have to take .

While acknowledging regional and economic differences , the plan sets national benchmarks that must be met to reopen the United States , which has been hard hit with at least 22 million new layoffs and more than 750,000 COVID-19 infections . The lawmakers recommend re-configuring business layouts for social distancing , ramping up cleaning and sanitizing public spaces and workplaces , and adopting data-driving benchmarks that will trigger the Department of Homeland Security to implement travel restrictions to and from infected countries .\nIn terms of economic recovery , the Problem Solvers Caucus says the U.S. needs to establish new supply chains for manufactured goods , including pharmaceuticals and medical supplies , and give financial incentives to bring overseas manufacturers back to the United States .\nThe plan calls for more business help , with expanding low-interest loans and tax incentives to businesses that were forced to close under stay-at-home orders .
