For many , the key motivation is that they want to protect others . There are precedents for that impulse , says Jill Suttie , a psychologist at The Greater Good Science Center at the University of California , Berkeley . A study demonstrated the most effective way for hospitals to motivate health care professionals to wash their hands isn \u2019 t by noting the importance of safeguarding oneself from disease . It \u2019 s stressing the impact it has on protecting patients .\nTo be sure , not everyone is acting altruistically at the moment . Fights have broken out in supermarkets as people wrestle for the last remaining item on a shelf . Some are hoarding hand sanitizer , face masks , and toilet paper . Many individuals ignored widespread pleas to practice social distancing this weekend by gathering at bars , restaurants , clubs , and music venues . In response , governors in several states , including Massachusetts and Ohio , shut down restaurants and bars except for delivery and takeout and canceled all concerts .\nEven so , instances of selflessness have become increasingly common . In Longmont , Colorado , The Roost restaurant and pub has offered free meals to families whose children would have relied on the closed schools to provide them with lunches . Professional basketball players such as Giannis Antetokounmpo , Zion Williamson , and Blake Griffin have donated money to cover the salaries of arena workers affected by the suspension of the season . And when Jordana Shmidman \u2019 s bat mitzvah was canceled due to the coronavirus , parents volunteered to deliver 150 boxes of the catered food to quarantined families across several boroughs in New York .\nWitnessing acts of kindness inspires others to pay it forward , says Mr. Zaki , a psychologist at Stanford University in California . In 2016 , he published an article in Scientific American , Kindness Contagion , that included findings of studies about how people \u201c catch \u201d cooperation and generosity from others . This deep-seated desire to help and connect with others intensifies during times of crisis and it crosses lanes of class , race , and other divisions that typically keep people apart .\nCase in point : When Germans began retreating behind closed doors last week , Molly Wilson realized she didn \u2019 t know any of the elderly people in her Berlin neighborhood . Ms. Wilson , an American who moved to Germany in 2016 , teamed up with an upstairs neighbor to post flyers on mailboxes and trash cans on their street . Their notes offered to go shopping on behalf of those who felt unable to go outside .\n\u201c My husband and I are both on parental leave , so one of us can absolutely go and get some noodles and beans for somebody who lives a couple streets over , \u201d says Ms. Wilson . She also posted her note on Twitter to inspire others . \u201c We need to do something off-line in order to let old people know that it \u2019 s OK to reach out for help . \u201d\nWhen in-person interaction is limited , technology can temporarily mend rips in the social fabric . Good Samaritans are using social media platforms to post offers to help strangers . For example , Jerry Xu , a tech professional in San Francisco , used the app NextDoor to volunteer his services . ( Free to join , NextDoor connects members to others in their geographic locale . ) \u201c We can help people use apps/websites to get goods ; we can help delivery with our vehicles ; we can even help with medical emergencies , \u201d Mr. Xu wrote in an email response to the Monitor .\nTo Marc Dunkelman , author of \u201c The Vanishing Neighbor , \u201d these neighborly responses to the coronavirus crisis are notable in their contrast to normal times . Most people \u2019 s acquaintances resemble a model like the rings of Saturn , with the innermost bands representing the most intimate connections and each successive loop becoming less intimate . Over the past 50 years , people have invested more time on the innermost ring of friends and family . People have also invested more time in the outermost rings with online acquaintances they don \u2019 t know personally but with whom they share common interests such as sports , hobbies , or politics .\nPeople have largely abandoned those rings in the middle , says Mr. Dunkelman , a research fellow at Brown University \u2019 s A. Alfred Taubman Center for Public Policy and American Institutions . Those are the face-to-face rings of contacts , such as neighbors and once-popular associations such as bowling leagues , Boy Scouts , or Rotary clubs . Yet the coronavirus , striking close to home , offers up the opportunity for greater local connection .\n\u201c Could it be that in the context of this crisis , people do break through that initial barrier and say to one another , even though they \u2019 re not supposed to be accosting one another or having real intimacy , \u2018 Hello . You know , I live in apartment 2B . You must live above me \u2019 ? \u201d says Mr. Dunkelman .\nFor his part , Mr. Dunkelman maintains a listserv of nearby neighbors and they \u2019 re using it to stay in contact and assist each other . Some have gone further . In Massachusetts , Mutual Aid Medford and Somerville ( MAMAS ) has created a shareable , public Google document to connect those with specific skill sets to those in need . In addition to sharing links to helpful resources during the coronavirus , it organizes neighborhood pods of hyperlocal text message groups or phone trees since not everyone has access to online communication . Other areas have used the document \u2019 s guide on how to replicate it . In the U.K. , the burgeoning COVID-19 Mutual Aid UK network is up to 87 groups and counting .\nThe crisis will necessarily alter the way we connect socially during the crisis . What matters most is how we interact with others , says Ms. Suttie of Greater Good , pointing to two major research papers on how emotions are contagious within social circles \u2013 including online associations .\n\u201c They found that it spreads within three degrees , \u201d says Ms. Suttie , who recommends \u201c trying to calm each other to the extent that we can and not raise panic because that helps all of us to be a bit calmer and to see things more clearly . \u201d\nAt the Jamaica Plain cohousing neighborhood in Boston , Ms. Sanchez is going to institute more sing-a-longs .
