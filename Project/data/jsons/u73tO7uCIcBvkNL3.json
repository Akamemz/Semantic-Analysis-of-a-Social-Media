These days , cashiers can \u2019 t calculate the right change without the register , people can \u2019 t figure out how many miles they can get on a full tank of gas , nobody knows how to calculate the tip , and nobody can calculate the cost of carpeting a room per square foot . In school you felt relieved that you weren \u2019 t the dumbest kid in class . Now it feels like you \u2019 re constantly encountering the dumbest kid in class everywhere you go .\nYou don \u2019 t live in Seattle , and you like your child \u2019 s elementary-school teacher . She hasn \u2019 t infused math class with oppression studies . But that doesn \u2019 t mean you don \u2019 t wonder if the school is preparing your children for the challenges they \u2019 ll face later on in life .\nYou feel like you \u2019 re constantly swimming against the tide . Someone told the PTA that the district should start \u201c meatless Mondays \u201d for the school lunches . Right , because elementary-school kids love salads so much . You consider it a small miracle when your youngest eats anything besides chicken nuggets or bologna sandwiches , and now they want to limit even those options \u2014 because the polar ice caps depend upon your child discovering a love for kale , or something .\nYou turned out okay , but you learned some things the hard way . You remember some teachers who were clearly just counting the years until retirement . Every year is a roulette wheel : gambling that your kids get one of the good teachers who are still emotionally invested in getting the best out of the class , rather than one who \u2019 s burned out by an emotionally exhausting job and cruises through the day , protected by tenure . You must have missed the day when we all voted to become a hyper-accountable society except when it comes to those teaching our kids .\nMaybe you could afford private school for your kids , but it would require a lot of belt-tightening . And what the heck are you paying all of these local taxes for if the local public school is falling down on the job ? Your cousin in another state keeps raving about her daughter \u2019 s charter school .
