    "content": "In the wake of Republican victories in the election last fall , pundits warned that Congress would be at loggerheads with President Obama on a number of budget issues in 2015 , including over highway funding and the Department of Homeland Security .\nNot high on the list of hot topics : Social Security .\nYet the vaunted social insurance system is suddenly a hot part of the fiscal debate in Washington \u2013 and it 's not waiting for 2016 elections . The new Obama budget proposes a patch to the program \u2019 s support for people with disabilities , but Republicans say the system needs an overhaul , not a Band-Aid .\nHow urgent an issue is this ? Specifically , how real is the financial trouble for the disability program ?\nThe two sides are far apart on their characterizations , but they agree that something needs to be done , and a good case can be made that the reality is between the extremes .\nMany Democrats and liberals say , in effect , that Social Security \u2019 s Disability Insurance program is in trouble only if Republicans refuse to rubber stamp Mr. Obama \u2019 s fix .\nSen. Bernie Sanders ( I ) of Vermont , the top member of the Democratic caucus on the Senate Budget Committee , accused Republicans of trying \u201c to manufacture a crisis where none exists . \u201d\nOn the Republican side , Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming , who chairs that panel , says that \u201c by December of next year , the program will be broke . \u201d\nWhat 's new is that after years of talk about Social Security 's solvency and the need to reform it ( or not ) , Congress has come to its first definitive fork in the road on the issue . Perhaps the problem isn \u2019 t as dire as Republicans say it is , but Obama also might not have a slam-dunk case for his patch .\nA good many economists agree with the Republican view that reforms are needed to keep the system solvent \u2013 and the sooner they \u2019 re enacted , the better it will be for the nation \u2019 s fiscal health .\nThe programs . The Social Security system has two trust funds , one for Old-Age and Survivors Insurance ( essentially retirees ) and one for Disability Insurance . The two funds ( OASDI ) have their own official balances and allocation of revenues from Social Security payroll taxes \u2013 and hence they have differing levels of solvency .\nThe problem . The old-age trust fund is on track to be able to keep paying promised benefits in full through 2034 , but the DI program can only do this through 2016 , according to estimates from Social Security \u2019 s trustees .\nGoing 'broke ' ? The 2016 date is where Senator Enzi and others draw references to DI \u201c bankruptcy \u201d or going \u201c broke \u201d by next year . It \u2019 s also what prompts the Obama administration to call for a fix . But the DI program would still have enough tax revenue that could keep funding about 81 percent of promised benefits . That \u2019 s not good for beneficiaries , but it \u2019 s not the same as going broke .\nObama 's proposal . Obama \u2019 s proposed fix is designed to balance things out so the two trust funds last for the same amount of time before running dry . It would put a higher share of payroll taxes toward the DI program , and a smaller share toward the old-age program . By Social Security \u2019 s estimates , that would mean neither trust fund would be depleted until 2033 .\nLooking ahead . That 2033 date is the one many Democrats emphasize when they call the other side alarmists . Yet at best , that merely postpones one day of reckoning ( the 2016 DI deadline ) while bringing another one ( for the old-age program ) a year closer . And when you \u2019 re talking about all US retirees facing the prospect of getting only 75 percent of promised benefits , 2033 isn \u2019 t so far away .\nThese facts suggest that Republican Sen.
