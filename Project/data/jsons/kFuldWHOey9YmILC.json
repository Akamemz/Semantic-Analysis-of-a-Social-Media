The \u201c possible military dimensions , \u201d which Mr. Netanyahu amplifies on every available occasion , are based not on the agency \u2019 s findings but on referrals by other member states with their own political agendas .

We will nevertheless continue to work with the agency to resolve this issue \u2014 despite our skepticism , which leads us to recall the notorious forged document about Niger \u2019 s \u201c yellowcake \u201d uranium that was used to coax the Security Council into authorizing the invasion of Iraq in 2003 .\nAs one side of the talks that continue in Geneva , Iran can also bear testimony to the campaign of misinformation by Mr. Netanyahu to mislead the global public about the details of those nuclear negotiations . When the parties were finalizing the interim agreement in 2013 , Mr. Netanyahu claimed that it would involve Iran \u2019 s receiving $ 50 billion in sanctions relief ; the actual amount was about $ 7 billion . And as for his prediction that Iran would never abide by the terms of the accord , Iran has dutifully stood by every commitment \u2014 as the International Atomic Energy Agency has reported .\nIn our view , Mr. Netanyahu has consistently used these false alarms and outlandish claims both to serve his domestic political maneuvering and to create a smoke screen that relegates the Palestinian question to the margins . We have noted how his rhetoric has intensified in proportion to the international pressure on Israel to stop the settlement activity and end the occupation of the Palestinian territory .\nThe paradox of the situation is that a government that has built a stockpile of nuclear weapons , rejected calls to establish a nuclear-weapons-free zone in the Middle East , made military incursions into neighboring states and flouted international law by keeping the lands of other nations under occupation , now makes such a big fuss over a country , Iran , that has not invaded another country since America became a sovereign nation .",
