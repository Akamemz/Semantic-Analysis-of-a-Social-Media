    "content": "While president , Barack Obama was a resolute critic of the idea that America was ready for single-payer healthcare . Free from the confines of his office , he 's warmed to the idea .\nIn a well-publicized speech this afternoon , the former Commander in Chief praised the bright ideas of his party 's progressive wing . `` Democrats are n't just running on good old ideas like a higher minimum wage , they 're running on good new ideas like Medicare-for-all , '' Obama said in his remarks , while also endorsing proposals like giving workers seats on corporate boards and reversing tax cuts .\nWhatever one thinks of Medicare-for-all\u2014also known as `` single-payer '' \u2014it can hardly be called a `` new '' idea . If it were , Obama would not have had to spend so much time in office and on the campaign trail dismissing it as unworkable .\nHere 's then-Sen. Obama at a campaign event in Albuquerque , New Mexico , in 2008 :\n`` If I were setting up a system from scratch , then I 'd probably set up a single-payer system . The problem is we 're not starting from scratch , '' said Obama . `` We have a system that most people have become accustom to getting their health insurance from their employer\u2026Making that transition in a rapid way would be very difficult . ''\nThen there 's the President Obama addressing the American Medical Association in 2009 , while the legislation that would eventually become Obamacare was still working its way through Congress :\n`` I 'll be honest . There are countries where a single-payer system may be working . But I believe\u2014and I 've even taken some flak from members of my own party for this belief\u2014that it is important for us to build on our traditions here in the United States . So , when you hear the naysayers claim that I 'm trying to bring about government-run health care , know this\u2014they are not telling the truth . ''\nThere was also that time in August 2009 , when Obama was asked at a town hall event in New Hampshire whether he supported single-payer healthcare :\n`` A single-payer plan would be a plan like Medicare for all , or the kind of plan that they have in Canada , where basically government is the only person\u2014is the only entity that pays for all health care , '' said Obama , before stating bluntly . `` I have not said that I was a single-payer supporter because , frankly , we historically have had a employer-based system in this country with private insurers , and for us to transition to a system like that I believe would be too disruptive . ''\nThis change in Obama 's attitude shows a couple things that are relevant for our current debate about Medicare-for-all .\nThe first is that this is not a bright new idea suddenly gaining traction , but rather an age-old Democratic priority that has never come to fruition because actually doing it would be incredibly difficult and potentially disastrous . This is probably why Obama 's enthusiasm for it has waxed and waned depending on his proximity to the White House .
