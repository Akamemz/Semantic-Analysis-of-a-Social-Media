    "content": "In recent months , New York Times readers brave enough to open the paper \u2019 s op-ed pages have been staggered to find opinions there . Yes , opinions !\nThe initial shock came in April , when Bret Stephens , a refugee from the Wall Street Journal opinion pages , took up residence at the Times , bringing with him his contrarian views on climate change . The Guardian spoke for injured readers everywhere with a piece headlined \u201c NY Times Hired a Hippie Puncher to Give Climate Obstructionists Cover. \u201d The inevitable Change.org petition calling for Stephens \u2019 sacking went up , gathering tens of thousands of signatures , and Times reporters and editors savaged him on Twitter . Compounding the grievance was Michael Kinsley \u2019 s opinion series \u201c Say Something Nice About Donald Trump , \u201d which elicited angry letters to the editor and ridicule from Newsweek , Fusion ( now Splinter ) and , of course , Twitter . ( Disclosure : Kinsley was my boss more than a decade ago . )\nOver the summer , umbrage fever spread to conservatives exposed to the \u201c Red Century \u201d series , the paper \u2019 s continuing op-ed exploration of \u201c the history and legacy of Communism , 100 years after the Russian Revolution. \u201d Why is the Times rehabilitating Communism , one Federalist writer asked , instead of dealing \u201c forthrightly with the horrors of the Soviet regime \u201d ? Another Federalist writer called \u201c Red Century \u201d a \u201c bizarre nostalgia series about communist dictatorships. \u201d Among the stories the Federalist took exception to were \u201c Why Women Had Better Sex Under Socialism , \u201d \u201c Thanks to Mom , the Marxist Revolutionary \u201d and \u201c When Communism Inspired Americans. \u201d \u201c The ghost of Walter Duranty still lives at the New York Times , \u201d the Federalist \u2019 s Inez Feltscher wrote .\nIt was the left \u2019 s turn to cry this week , as the page published an op-ed by Erik Prince , the founder of the Blackwater mercenary army and Betsy DeVos \u2019 brother . Prince proposed a potentially self-dealing solution to the Afghanistan stalemate : A mercenary army of about 6,000 to assist an American Special Operations force of 2,000 . The New Republic disparaged the piece as a Prince sales pitch . Huffington Post Editor in Chief Lydia Polgreen tweeted , \u201c Unbowed , a newspaper continues to flog its lousy opinion piece. \u201d Also taking exception to the Times \u2019 editorial judgment were writers at Slate and GQ . New York magazine took the easy route , scraping Twitter for the inevitable parody headlines .\nAs susceptible as the next guy to hating the Times for running pieces I disagree with , I used as kindling to start a trash fire the recent Times page in which K-Sue Park informed the ACLU it needed to rethink free speech . Then , guided by a 2010 article about the history of the Times op-ed page written by University of Maine professor of journalism Michael Socolow , I returned to my senses .
