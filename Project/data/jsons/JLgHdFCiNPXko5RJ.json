But , of course , rationalizations can hurt others , too . The road to adultery is mostly paved with rationalizations of one kind or another . Most bad parenting , likewise , is grounded in rationalizations of sloth , selfishness , and even cruelty . I sometimes tell myself it \u2019 s okay for my kid to watch more TV than she should because I watched a lot of TV and I turned out okay ( \u201c Debatable \u201d \u2014 the Couch ) or because I think she needs to be ( pop ) culturally fluent , when the truth is that I \u2019 m just too lazy or busy . Surely many abusive parents tell themselves self-serving lies about how whatever they \u2019 re doing is good for their kids .\nWhile noodling this \u201c news \u201d letter , I googled around for essays on rationalization . I had the vague recollection that Friedrich Hayek had written something specific on the topic \u2014 and he probably did \u2014 but I couldn \u2019 t find what I was looking for . I did , however , find an enormous amount on the topic on websites dedicated to counseling and ethics , including some interesting lists of common rationalizations . I particularly liked this , from something called the Josephson Institute :\nRationalizations are the most potent enemy to integrity . They work like an anesthetic to our consciences allowing us to avoid the pain of guilt when we don \u2019 t live up to our values . We want to think well of ourselves so much that we develop strategies to convince ourselves that we are better than we actually are .\nJesus said love our neighbors as ourselves but never told Caesar how to run Rome-he never said Roman soldiers should turn the other cheek in battle or that Caesar should allow all the barbarians to be Roman citizens or that Caesar should tax the rich to help poor .

The bulk of the Left despises every argument about IQ differences among populations in part because leftists claim it denies the humanity of certain groups . Feminists leap to fainting couches when you float the idea that there are significant statistical differences between the sexes . On the most basic level , the argument for diversity as its own reward should celebrate people with Downs because they make a meaningful contribution to the rich diversity of humanity . The few people with Downs I \u2019 ve gotten to know even a little have been among the most joyful and courteous people I \u2019 ve ever met .\nBut here \u2019 s the problem . Some people don \u2019 t want to have kids with Down syndrome . And , I will admit , I think this is entirely understandable . But that \u2019 s not the relevant issue . Abortion advocates also believe that there should be no limitation on abortion rights for any reason \u2014 which is why we are joined by North Korea and China as one of only seven countries in the world that allows abortion past 20 weeks .\nAnd that is the motivating passion here : maintaining a maximalist abortion regime . If , somehow , abortion and Downs never intersected , it would be easy to see people with Downs being celebrated as part of the rich rainbow of humanity . But they do intersect , and turning them into disposable humans \u2014 or what the Germans called \u201c life unworthy of life \u201d ( Lebensunwertes Leben ) is apparently a small price to pay in defense of abortion .
