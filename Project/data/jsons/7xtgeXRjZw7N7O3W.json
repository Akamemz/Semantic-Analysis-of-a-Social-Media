They both ran credible presidential campaigns and positioned themselves as moderates , which makes them ideological soulmates for Biden . Both women have won the political triple crown and served in elective office at the local , state and federal level\u2026 \u201c A Midwesterner like Klobuchar could help Biden win the battleground states in America \u2019 s industrial heartland . But there is more than one recipe for a victory meal in the Midwest . Biden also might help himself with an African American running mate like Harris who night gin up black turnout in Philadelphia , Detroit and Milwaukee . A higher urban turnout would make a big difference in states that Trump barely won in 2016. \u201d Brad Bannon , The Hill\nRegarding Biden \u2019 s choice for VP , \u201c It \u2019 s true that Abrams has been honest about her ambition to be in the White House . But really , what choice does any woman have but to make the case for herself , especially if that woman was , like Abrams , born outside the natural network of wealthy friends and influential relatives who could be doing her bidding for her ? \u2026 \u201c Some men picked to be vice president , such as Al Gore and George H.W . Bush , had senator fathers with powerful associates , pushing them along their roads to success the whole of their careers . Nebraska-born Dick Cheney didn \u2019 t have that kind of network , but he literally picked himself for the job of vice president after the presumptive Republican nominee , George W. Bush , asked him to run his vetting process\u2026 Stacey Abrams likely wo n't be the next vice president , nor should she be . But she has changed the face of female ambition forever . \u201d Patricia Murphy , USA Today\nRegarding the Trump campaign 's efforts to paint Biden as weak on China , it 's worth noting that \u201c Mr . Trump [ initially ] downplayed the risk of the coronavirus and heaped praise on President Xi Jinping . Fifteen times in January and February , Mr. Trump lauded Mr. Xi \u2019 s leadership on Covid-19\u2026 \u201c On strategic imperatives , Mr. Trump allowed China to ease pressure on North Korea and failed to counter China \u2019 s cyberaggression and expansionism in the South China Sea . Yet , he saved the Chinese pariah telecom firm ZTE because American sanctions might cause \u2018 too many jobs in China \u2019 to be lost . Mr. Trump also eagerly enlisted China to serve his personal interests , most notably by pleading for China \u2019 s help in the coming election and allowing his daughter Ivanka to pocket plenty of Chinese trademarks . Given such a self-serving and shameful legacy , it will take some truly Trumpian Houdini tactics to tar Joe Biden with being weak on China . In reality , the opposite is true. \u201d Susan E. Rice , New York Times\n\u201c While the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to win over Bernie Sanders voters have pushed the Biden campaign to embrace a more ambitious domestic agenda , little evidence indicates that the presumptive Democratic nominee is doing anything comparable on international affairs .
