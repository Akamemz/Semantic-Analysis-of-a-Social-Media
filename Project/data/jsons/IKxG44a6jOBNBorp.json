Elizabeth Warren \u2019 s presidential campaign appears to be concentrating its firepower on Nevada rather than South Carolina \u2013 with those two states on deck in the presidential-nomination calendar .\nWarren \u2019 s campaign confirmed to Fox News on Wednesday that they will not continue their current TV ad buy in South Carolina when it expires on Feb. 16 . Instead , they \u2019 ll use the money -- plus additional spending \u2013 to beef up the current TV spots running in Nevada and to also run TV spots in Maine , which is one of the 14 Super Tuesday states that hold contests on March 3 .\nWarren \u2019 s move comes after the progressive senator suffered a distant and disappointing fourth-place finish in Tuesday \u2019 s primary in neighboring New Hampshire .\nWhile the Warren campaign said it still would go up with radio , digital and print ads in South Carolina , the move served as a clear sign that for now , Nevada \u2019 s Feb. 22 caucuses outweigh the primary in South Carolina a week later . That \u2019 s not the case for former Vice President Joe Biden , who finished an extremely disappointing fifth in New Hampshire . He considers South Carolina as his campaign \u2019 s firewall .\nMeanwhile , sources close to three rival campaigns to Warren told Fox News they \u2019 re now taking a hard look at Massachusetts , another Super Tuesday state . It \u2019 s another sign of how Warren \u2019 s standing has dropped severelyv following Iowa and New Hampshire .\nSen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota \u2013 whose strong third-place finish in New Hampshire exceeded expectations and gave her a major boost \u2013 has been beefing up her operation in Nevada .\nKlobuchar \u2019 s campaign confirmed to Fox News it \u2019 s going up with a seven-figure TV ad buy in Nevada starting Wednesday . The campaign touted it \u2019 ll have 50 staffers on the ground in the state by later this week . And , officials said they \u2019 ll start deploying troops to the Super Tuesday states starting this weekend .\nFormer South Bend , Ind. , Mayor Pete Buttigieg , who came in a close second to primary winner Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont , is also pouring more troops into Nevada . His campaign announced on Wednesday that they \u2019 ll double their staffers in the state to nearly 100 and boost their investment in TV and digital ads .\nFormer Massachusetts Gov . Deval Patrick ended his long-shot White House bid on Wednesday , one day after a dismal showing in the New Hampshire presidential primary .\n\u201c The vote in New Hampshire last night was not enough for us to create the practical wind at the campaign \u2019 s back to go on to the next round of voting . So I have decided to suspend the campaign , effective immediately , \u201d Patrick said in a statement .\nEven though he was relatively well known in New Hampshire as the two-term governor from a neighboring state \u2013 and he heavily campaigned in the first-in-the-nation primary state since declaring his candidacy in mid-November -- Patrick grabbed less than 1 percent of the vote , according to the latest results . His departure means there are no longer any other African-Americans in the race .\nTech entrepreneur Andrew Yang dropped out of the race after a poor showing New Hampshire , and now Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard has been moving to win over his supporters by emphasizing her support for a universal basic income .\nIn a tweet Wednesday , Gabbard wrote : \u201c To our many # YangGang friends , I hope that you will join our campaign . \u201d\nYang , a relative unknown before the 2020 campaign , rose to fame in large part due to the popularity of his proposed `` Freedom Dividend '' \u2013 a universal basic income ( UBI ) that would pay each adult American $ 1,000 per month . Yang said Thursday he no plans to endorse any other candidate yet , but it \u2019 s hard to imagine him backing anyone who doesn \u2019 t embrace a UBI .\n\u201c I 'll continue to carry this torch of Universal Basic Income that will re-invigorate our middle class and those struggling just to make ends meet , bridge the income gap and unleash an era of entrepreneurship and productivity , \u201d Gabbard tweeted .\nAs for Yang , there \u2019 s already speculation about what \u2019 s next for him , ranging from running again for president in four years to making a bid for another office , like mayor of New York .\nPresident Trump \u2013 as expected \u2013 handily won New Hampshire \u2019 s Republican primary , as he had no serious challenger . But what \u2019 s raising eyebrows are the total of votes he got in a noncompetitive race .\nTrump secured more than 120,000 votes in the Granite State . As Fox News \u2019 Tyler Olson reported , that \u2019 s more than double what incumbent President Barack Obama got in the state \u2019 s 2012 primary , when he managed to win 49,080 total votes . It also dwarfs the total of other incumbent presidents : then-President George W. Bush received 53,962 votes in the largely-uncontested GOP primary in New Hampshire in 2004 .
