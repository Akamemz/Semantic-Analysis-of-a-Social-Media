    "content": "Putting into action his campaign \u2019 s tough talk on trade , President Trump signed an executive order Monday that formally withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade deal .\nMr. Trump could end the U.S. participation with 11 other Pacific Rim nations with the stroke of a pen because Congress had not ratified the ambitious accord despite strong support from business groups and President Obama . Nevertheless , the withdrawal put Capitol Hill and foreign governments on notice that the president would demand better deals on a one-on-one basis .\nAfter signing the document , Mr. Trump declared that it was a \u201c great thing for the American worker . \u201d\nThe president \u2019 s populist stance on trade shook up alliances in Washington . Mr. Trump got a round of applause from union leaders during a meeting at the White House , but prominent Republican lawmakers vowed to defend their party \u2019 s traditional support for open markets and free trade .\n\u201c We \u2019 re going to stop the ridiculous trade deals that have taken everybody out of our country and taken companies out of our country , and it \u2019 s going to be reversed , \u201d Mr. Trump told the labor leaders , including some representing ironworkers and sheet metal workers . \u201c Companies that left are going to come back to our country , and they \u2019 re going to hire a lot of people . \u201d\nHis focus was on the economy and jobs for his first full day in the Oval Office . He began with a breakfast meeting with prominent business leaders , outlining a plan for massive reductions in taxes and federal regulations to spur economic growth .\nMr. Trump also took action on thorny social issues and the federal workforce .\nHe signed executive orders freezing nonmilitary federal hiring and reinstating the Mexico City Policy that effectively limits federal funding for abortions abroad .\nThe abortion rule has routinely been adopted by Republican administrations and canceled by Democratic administrations since President Reagan enacted it in 1984 . By carrying on the tradition , Mr. Trump gave a nod to his evangelical and pro-life supporters in the run-up to the March for Life rally Friday in Washington .\nIt also added fuel to the fiery opposition from liberal and pro-choice groups , hoping to build on the momentum from large anti-Trump rallies led by women \u2019 s groups in Washington and other cities over the weekend .\nIn an email to supporters , the liberal Center for American Progress proclaimed that Mr. Trump was \u201c already threatening women worldwide . \u201d\nThe three executive orders signed Monday and the orders signed after the inauguration Friday , including one blocking Obamacare regulations and another delaying all pending Obama administration regulations , fell short of the more than dozen actions that , as a candidate , Mr. Trump promised to take on Day One .\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer said the administration was pacing its executive actions .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a way that we can do this to make sure that we \u2019 re getting all of those things that he promised the American people done in short haste and doing it in a way that doesn \u2019 t just jam them out in a fire hose , \u201d he said at his first press briefing .\nGetting the U.S. out of the TPP , which Mr. Trump had described as a \u201c bad deal \u201d and a \u201c death blow for American workers , \u201d was a top campaign promise and part of the America-first agenda that he says will create jobs .\nWith many Democrats also having come to oppose the Asian trade agreement , Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer , New York Democrat , dismissed the formal withdrawal from the deal as meaningless .\n\u201c TPP was dead long before President Trump took office . We await real action on trade , \u201d Mr. Schumer said .\nBut Sen. John McCain , Arizona Republican , said trashing the TPP was \u201c a serious mistake that will have lasting consequences for America \u2019 s economy and our strategic position in the Asia-Pacific region . \u201d\n\u201c This decision will forfeit the opportunity to promote American exports , reduce trade barriers , open new markets , and protect American invention and innovation , \u201d he said . \u201c It will create an opening for China to rewrite the economic rules of the road at the expense of American workers . And it will send a troubling signal of American disengagement in the Asia-Pacific region at a time we can least afford it . \u201d\nBut the move got applause from Sen. Bernard Sanders , the Vermont independent who emerged from his presidential run as a leader of the Democratic Party \u2019 s liberal wing .\n\u201c I am glad the Trans-Pacific Partnership is dead and gone , \u201d he said . \u201c If President Trump is serious about a new policy to help American workers , then I would be delighted to work with him . \u201d\nMr. Trump is expected in coming days to sign an executive order to begin renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico .
