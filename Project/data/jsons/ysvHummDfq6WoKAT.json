    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Days after House Republicans lost their majority and gathered to choose new leaders from their shrunken ranks , New York Rep. Elise Stefanik stood up at the closed-door meeting and asked her colleagues to look around .\n\u201c This is not reflective of the American public , \u201d Stefanik said of the overwhelmingly white group of new and returning lawmakers that included only 13 women . \u201c We need to do better . \u201d\nWeeks later , Stefanik was frustrated that there still wasn \u2019 t enough introspection .\n\u201c Some people are scratching their heads , wondering why those larger conversations aren \u2019 t happening , \u201d Stefanik told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nLikewise , Indiana Rep. Susan Brooks , the outgoing co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Caucus for Women \u2019 s Issues , said she is in mourning for her defeated female colleagues . The Republican who was supposed to succeed Brooks as caucus co-chair \u2013 California Rep. Mimi Walters \u2013 was among the November casualties .\n\u201c Everyone is struggling right now for answers , \u201d she said . \u201c Fifty-two Republican women ran for Congress \u2026 and only 13 of us made it across the finish line . \u201d\nThat will be the lowest number of Republican women in the House in a quarter-century .\nBy contrast , voters elected a record 89 Democratic women to the House . Republicans have never had more than 25 women , a record set in 2006 .\nThere will be only one Republican woman in the freshman class : Carol Miller of West Virginia .\n( In the Senate , Republicans expanded their number of women by one to seven . The number of Democratic female senators will remain the same at 17 . )\nThough there \u2019 s been much attention on this election \u2019 s \u201c Year of the Woman , \u201d which sent a record number of women to Congress and to state legislatures nationwide , there \u2019 s been less focus on the diminished ranks of Republican women .\nSome narrowly lost and would have done better in a year when all Republicans weren \u2019 t facing headwinds .\nBut even in good years for the GOP , such as when it took over the House in 2010 , Republican women have not expanded their ranks the way Democrats have .\nExperts said Republicans don \u2019 t have the same support for women that Democrats do to help recruit candidates , raise campaign funds and win primaries . That \u2019 s hard to do , said Idaho State University assistant professor Malliga Och , when the party tends to be dismissive of \u201c identity politics \u201d as something that lowers the quality of candidates .\n\u201c You can not just say , 'Oh , women should be there , ' and wait for the women to come , \u201d said Och , who studies women in politics . \u201c You need to be more proactive . \u201d\nAs more women identify with the Democratic Party \u2013 as shown by the 19-percentage-point gender gap in votes for House candidates \u2013 the pool of potential Republican candidates shrinks .\n\u201c We have especially failed to bring our message to , and connect with , women and racial minorities , \u201d Utah Rep.
