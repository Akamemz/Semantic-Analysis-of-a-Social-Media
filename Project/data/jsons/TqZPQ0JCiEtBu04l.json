    "content": "Perhaps nowhere outside America \u2019 s heartland is Donald Trump given more credit than in Beijing .\nIn government offices and think tanks , universities and state-run newsrooms , there is an urgent debate underway about what many here see as the hidden motive for Washington \u2019 s escalating trade war against President Xi Jinping \u2019 s government : A grand strategy , devised and led by Trump , to thwart China \u2019 s rise as a global power .\n\u201c The Trump administration has made it clear that containing China \u2019 s development is a deeper reason behind the tariff actions , \u201d said He Weiwen , a former commerce ministry official and now a senior fellow at the Center for China and Globalization , an independent research group filled with former bureaucrats .\nTrump holds up a memorandum targeting China \u2019 s economic aggression in March 2018 . Photographer : Andrew Harrer/\u2588\u2588\u2588\nThese sentiments were echoed by many of the more than two dozen current and former government officials , business executives , state-affiliated researchers , diplomats and state-run media editors interviewed for this article . Most requested anonymity to speak their minds about sensitive matters .\nA common suspicion ran through the conversations -- that the tariffs are just a small part of Trump \u2019 s plan to prevent China from overtaking the U.S. as the world \u2019 s largest economy . Several people expressed concern that the two nations may be heading into a long struggle for global dominance that recalls the last century \u2019 s rivalry between the U.S. and Soviet Union .\nU.S.-China Trade War Only the Start of Fight for World Dominance\n\u201c The trade war has prompted thinking in China on whether a new cold war has begun , \u201d said An Gang , a senior research fellow at the Pangoal Institution , an independent research group in Beijing whose experts include former government officials . The dispute , he says , \u201c now has military and strategic implications \u201d -- reflecting concern among some in Beijing that tensions could spill over into Taiwan , the South China Sea and North Korea .\nThe general pessimism is a major shift among China \u2019 s elite , many of whom had initially welcomed the rise of a U.S. president viewed as a transactional pragmatist who would cut a deal to narrow a $ 375 billion trade deficit for the right price . Now , with tariffs on $ 34 billion of goods already in effect and duties on another $ 216 billion in the pipeline , a majority saw no quick fix to a problem that is starting to rattle the country \u2019 s top leaders .\nThe turning point came a few months ago , when Trump put a stop to a deal for China to buy more energy and agricultural goods to narrow the trade deficit . Not only did that insult Xi , China \u2019 s all-powerful leader who had sent a personal emissary to Washington for the negotiations , but it crystallized a view in Beijing that Trump won \u2019 t quit until he thwarts China \u2019 s rise once and for all .\n\u201c Donald Trump is a smart negotiator who has accumulated abundant experience in doing business for many years -- and also from the show \u2018 The Apprentice , \u2019 \u201d said Wang Huiyao , an adviser to China \u2019 s cabinet and founder of the Center for China and Globalization , whose advisory council is stacked with former lawmakers . While \u201c China is open to negotiations , \u201d he said , Trump \u2019 s pressure tactics \u201c will only arouse Chinese nationalism , which will be counterproductive . \u201d\nThe ramifications of that are now rippling through a society that has embraced America \u2019 s consumer culture -- Big Macs , Bentley cars and Chanel handbags are ubiquitous in Beijing -- even as it retains a one-party political system that champions large state enterprises and has little tolerance for dissent .\nThe trade war is leading to some soul searching in Beijing . Discussions quickly turn to the sustainability of China \u2019 s state-centered economy and the leadership of Xi , who can rule the country indefinitely after he led a successful effort earlier this year to repeal presidential term limits .\nThe hushed debate centers over the wisdom of Xi \u2019 s goals for rapid growth and his decision to announce China \u2019 s ambitions to the world . This was a dramatic shift from former leader Deng Xiaoping \u2019 s famous dictum , \u201c Hide your strength , bide your time. \u201d Critics of Xi say policies like Made in China 2025 ( a plan to dominate industries such as aircraft , new energy vehicles and biotechnology ) and the Belt and Road Initiative ( a mechanism to finance infrastructure investments around the globe ) raised alarm in the West , and prompted the U.S. to target China before it could build critical technologies .\nThis was seen by how swiftly Trump could bring down ZTE Corp. , China \u2019 s second-largest telecommunications equipment maker . In April , his administration prohibited the company from buying essential components from American suppliers after it violated laws banning the sale of U.S. technology to Iran . The move prompted ZTE to cease major operating activities until Trump came to the rescue and helped engineer a settlement .\nHow ZTE Ended Up in Middle of U.S.-China Trade War : QuickTake\nAlthough ZTE is now back up and running , the episode showed China just how dependent the nation is on the U.S. for high-end know-how . It has also highlighted wider efforts to block Chinese firms from acquiring tech companies by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States , which reviews deals on national security grounds . All in all it amounts to \u201c high-tech containment \u201d of China , said Shi Yinhong , a foreign affairs adviser to the State Council and director of Renmin University \u2019 s Center on American Studies in Beijing .\nThe U.S. , of course , sees things differently . Officials have repeatedly said they don \u2019 t want to prevent China from growing , they just want to stop it from breaking the rules and stealing intellectual property -- allegations that officials in Beijing repeatedly deny .\nThe Pentagon recently named China and Russia as two U.S. rivals actively seeking to \u201c co-opt or replace the free and open order that has enabled global security and prosperity since World War II. \u201d Last month , U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo obliquely criticized China for wooing developing countries with cheap financing for infrastructure projects , saying the U.S. believes in \u201c strategic partnerships , not strategic dependency . \u201d\n\u201c With American companies , citizens around the world know that what you see is what you get : honest contracts , honest terms and no need for off-the-books nonsense , \u201d Pompeo said in a speech before he attended a regional security forum in Singapore . Another advantage of the U.S. , he said , is that \u201c we will help them keep their people free from coercion or great power domination . \u201d\nAcross the political spectrum in China , from reformers to nationalists , there \u2019 s a growing consensus that the nation needs to open up more to foreign business , better protect intellectual property and create a more level playing field . The confrontation with the U.S. was \u201c due in large part to China doing nothing for many years \u201d to reduce the surplus , widen market access and ease state control , according to Shi from Renmin University . \u201c China faces a new , uncertain situation and needs to undergo review and adjustment , \u201d he said . \u201c We didn \u2019 t consider other nations \u2019 feelings in our strategic great leap forward . \u201d\nYet sentiments like these are tempered by a reluctance to be seen as bending to Trump \u2019 s demands . Several people said that at first they viewed the U.S. tariffs as not all bad if they prompted the government to make long overdue adjustments in China \u2019 s approach to doing business with the West . But as the trade war , and the war of words , has escalated , many of these same people are now digging in against the U.S. , saying China won \u2019 t be bullied .\nXi Jinping at the closing of the First Session of the 13th National People \u2019 s Congress in March 2018 . Photographer : Giulia Marchi/\u2588\u2588\u2588\nApart from some criticism from academics and grumbling from unnamed officials , so far there \u2019 s little visible sign from China \u2019 s opaque government that the trade war has impacted Xi \u2019 s ability to control the levers of money and power . If Xi and his ministers are themselves suffering any doubts , it \u2019 s not reflected in the official press .

It \u2019 s certainly true that the U.S. economy is far stronger than China \u2019 s . But in Beijing , there is general confidence that in a test of wills between the two presidents , it \u2019 s Xi -- who doesn \u2019 t have to worry about elections or the wrath of special interest groups -- who can endure more pain .\nFive Sticking Points Keeping Xi and Trump From a Trade Deal\nChina has also hinted there are ways to turn up the pressure on Trump , if necessary .
