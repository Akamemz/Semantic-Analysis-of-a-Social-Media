''\nThanks to her name recognition , the former first lady , senator from New York and secretary of state is the overwhelming frontrunner in early 2016 surveys . In the most recent survey , conducted earlier this month by CNN/ORC International , nearly two-thirds of Democrats and independents who lean toward that party said they were likely to back Clinton as their presidential nominee .

''\n`` She is the prohibitive favorite , but the dynamics of the race change the longer someone waits .
