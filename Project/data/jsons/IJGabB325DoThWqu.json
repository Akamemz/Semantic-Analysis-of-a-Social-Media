    "content": "The question of when Donald Trump lost the election to Hillary Clinton will occupy politicians and strategists for years , and how you answer it determines much about where our politics go next . Did he lose it in Cleveland , when the party stayed divided and his acceptance speech offered 76 minutes of darkness leavened only occasionally by optimism ? Did he lose it in the debates that followed later in 2016 , when he revealed himself to be ( let us indulge in a forecast here ) unsteady on policy ? Or did he lose it the day he launched his run and categorized south-of-the-border immigrants as the dregs of their country ? The earlier you put his loss , the more you attribute it to ideology and character ; the later you put his loss , the more you attribute it to tactics .\nMy own hunch is that Trump lost in April , the period in which his ideology looked like it could win and general-election tactics had not yet come into play , but character was crucial . At a time when self-restraint would have sealed the deal , Trump sabotaged himself and caused the primaries to drag out , demoralizing his supporters and scaring off lurkers . In particular , the threats and insults directed at Ted Cruz \u2019 s wife , trivial in one sense but profound in another , underscored people \u2019 s worst fears : that Trump \u2019 s impulses were uncontrolled , that he would not refrain from harming himself , and that transgressing the bounds of decency was not a gambit but a part of his nature .\nBut if you feel that tactics were the culprit , then Trump \u2019 s R.N.C . speech on Thursday night was a relevant setback , no matter what the polls said the morning after . To be fair , many people left Quicken Loans Arena feeling inspired , happily slogging through a thigh-high sea of red , white , and blue balloons that popped underfoot . They felt good not because of pageantry or even because of Ivanka Trump ( her speech had become a distant memory by the time her father neared the 60-minute mark ) . They felt good because Trump had dispelled their doubts about his sincerity on the issues of trade , immigration , and foreign policy . Contradictory statements and signals , including the choice of Mike Pence as vice president , had shaken their certainty . Trump \u2019 s speech sent a clear message : I \u2019 m dead-serious about this , and the establishment positions are not mine . The price of reassuring his core supporters , however , was probably the loss of many on the fence . Also , while political conventions deal with dark topics , they can not wallow in them . Trump \u2019 s address wallowed in them .\nNot many of those in the thick of the action here have yet stepped back to think . The focus in Cleveland , for participants of all sorts , was weathering each day as it came . No one sits still for long at a political convention , and no one sleeps . Everyone is tired and wired , looking blearier each day . Trump floor whips , identifiable by fluorescent green caps in the convention hall , led chants in the evening , partied late into the night , and rose early the next morning to prepare things for the upcoming day . Young journalists , marked by button-down shirts and jeans , filed stories at all times of day , hit hotel bars ( usually at the Westin , lodging headquarters of the Trump crew ) looking for story fodder and a drink , and woke and slept at odd hours to sync up with the right rally or event . Political bigwigs burrowed through Cleveland like groundhogs , popping up at a conference room here or a restaurant there , sometimes running into journalists , other times eluding them . Newt Gingrich and his wife were still dining and drinking with friends at the Westin at two in the morning after their appearance on the stage Wednesday night .",
