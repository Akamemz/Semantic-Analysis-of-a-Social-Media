At the same time , letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump , despite his attempt to subvert the system , should have another chance\u2026 Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus .

There is enough here to support impeachment . Whether it is also enough to convince Republicans and lead to removal is another matter. \u201d Noah Feldman , Bloomberg\n\u201c Trump \u2019 s defenders will say this evidence is all circumstantial . But circumstantial evidence is not weak evidence : it \u2019 s simply evidence based on the circumstances in which an act of wrongdoing is committed \u2014 such as the license plate of a car that speeds away from a bank just after that bank is robbed . Criminals are convicted on such evidence all the time . They will also say that there \u2019 s no explicit quid pro quo proposal here . But\u2026 \u2018 even when a corrupt deal is struck implicitly , the government can still prosecute extortion on a quid pro quo basis . Circumstantial evidence can be enough to prove a criminal exchange. \u2019 \u2026\nKashmir \u201c had long been exempted from parts of the Indian Constitution and set its own laws , even as it remained under Indian control , an anomalous status that a government under the sway of Hindu nationalism will no longer tolerate . Meanwhile , protesters in the streets of Hong Kong are pushing back against efforts by the Chinese government to chip away at the semi-independent status it has enjoyed\u2014known as \u2018 one country , two systems \u2019 \u2014since the former British colony came under Chinese control in 1997\u2026 \u201c These stories are all signs that national governments are waging a war against ambiguity\u2014of citizenship , of territorial status\u2014to enforce a rigid and uniform vision of statehood\u2026 Liberal commentators often fret about the threat that Trump and other right-wing populist leaders pose to the postwar \u2018 rules-based international order. \u2019 But Trump and his cohort are obsessed with rules and order when it comes to national sovereignty , borders , and who gets to live within those borders . Trump has often argued that \u2018 If you don \u2019 t have Borders , you don \u2019 t have a Country ! \u2019 ... This philosophy fails to recognize that a certain amount of ambiguity can be stabilizing in the absence of a political consensus . \u201d Joshua Keating , Slate\n\u201c India is in danger of becoming what I have called an \u2018 election-only democracy. \u2019 Once a party has won an election , it is unaccountable for its acts .

But India , which just this week celebrated 72 years of independence as a boisterous , multiethnic and multiconfessional democracy ? Mr. Modi might have fulfilled a dream of Hindu nationalists going back to the 1950s , but he also stained that democracy and most likely stoked anger in Kashmir that will fester long into the future . \u201d Editorial Board , Washington Post\n\u201c As if a communications blackout and restrictions on movements were not enough , news reports indicate there have been hundreds of political arrests , and that at least one journalist -- Qazi Shibli , editor of news website The Kashmiriyat -- has been detained\u2026 Who else is imprisoned in Kashmir right now ? What other tactics are security forces using to suppress information ? How else has this blackout impacted the region 's population ? How do Kashmiris feel about recent developments ? Or about the future of their region ? We really do n't know. \u201d Michael De Dora and Aliya Iftikhar , CNN\n\u201c Since [ Modi \u2019 s ] 2014 election to the premiership , bigotry has been ennobled as a healthy form of self-assertion . Lynchings of Muslims \u2014 breathlessly demonized as jihadists devoted to seducing and converting Hindu women \u2014 by aggrieved Hindu mobs have become such a common sport that dozens of videos of grisly murders circulate on WhatsApp groups run by Hindu nationalists . Last summer , a minister in Modi \u2019 s cabinet garlanded eight men who had been convicted of lynching a Muslim man . In this universe , Kashmir could never remain autonomous\u2026 Kashmir is both a warning and a template : Any state that deviates from this vision can be brought under Delhi \u2019 s thumb in the name of \u2018 unity. \u2019 \u201d Kapil Komireddi , Washington Post\nThe right sees the move as a predictable consequence of Pakistan \u2019 s support for Islamists .\nThe right sees the move as a predictable consequence of Pakistan \u2019 s support for Islamists .\n\u201c It \u2019 s too early to say whether the prime minister \u2019 s audacious gamble , wildly popular\namong his supporters and welcomed by many other Indians , will pay off . India \u2019 s Supreme Court may well declare the decision unconstitutional . But Pakistan , which has long made Kashmir a central plank of its foreign policy , lacks the wherewithal to force India \u2019 s hand . By backing jihadist groups in India and Afghanistan and neglecting its economy , Islamabad has ensured that it lacks the stature to make India take its views on board.\u2026 When it comes to the seven-decade-old Kashmir conflict , Pakistan has few cards left to play\u2026\n\u201c Pakistanis who find [ the international ] response underwhelming ought to blame their army . Its support for jihadist proxies has made Kashmiri separatism synonymous with Islamist extremism . Pakistan could step up that support , but at the risk of both international censure and Indian military retaliation ... Meanwhile , India \u2019 s $ 2.7 trillion economy , more than eight times as large as Pakistan \u2019 s , gives it international heft . The Pakistan army \u2019 s own shabby treatment of journalists , opposition leaders and ethnic movements representing the minority Baluch and Pashtuns , makes it hard for Islamabad to argue that Kashmiris will be better off in Pakistan . \u201d\n\u201c Historically , Pakistan has used Jammu and Kashmir is a means to end \u2013 a strategic pain point where Islamabad can ratchet pressure up or down when it wants to get Delhi \u2019 s attention\u2026 Modi \u2019 s latest move shows that little has changed . And while unexpected , it was not entirely unpredictable . The manifesto of the BJP , Modi \u2019 s ruling party , has long called for this . And Pakistan has already done something similar with the portion of Kashmir it administers\u2026 So , what role is there for the U.S. ? Not much . Indians will consider this an internal matter and resent any outside attempt at intervention or coercion . India has always rejected outside mediation in Kashmir , and the U.S. government considers the Kashmir dispute a bilateral issue to be resolved between India and Pakistan . \u201d\n\u201c India is thinking strategically and is preparing for what it believes will be an Afghan Taliban takeover of Kabul , Afghanistan , following a peace treaty and substantial U.S. and NATO withdrawal . For decades , the Taliban , the Haqqani network , Pakistani ISI ( intelligence service ) , and the Pakistan Army have collaborated as if joined at the hip , managing Pashtun nationalism as a force against the U.S. and NATO . While the Pakistan Army has waged counterinsurgency against Islamist and insurgent forces , it did just enough to receive continued U.S. military and financial aid , but not enough to prevail against an ethnic group that will be there long after a withdrawal by the West . Of late , the Taliban has expressed concern over the welfare of Kashmiris \u2014 operating in the future with the platform of a nation state in concert with the Pakistan Army and ISI , it constitutes an ominous and potentially aggressive threat to India \u2019 s national security well beyond the status quo . \u201d\nSome note that \u201c Modi \u2019 s dislike of Muslim influence in India is well known . His party , the BJP , has its origins in thinkers who thought Muslims \u2018 were not children of [ India \u2019 s ] soil. \u2019 While governor of Gujarat in 2002 , Modi was accused of supporting communal riots in the state that saw almost 1,000 Muslims killed . His landslide re-election as prime minister earlier this year was seen by the country \u2019 s Muslims as a signal that Hindu nationalism was here to stay . The demotion of Kashmir , India \u2019 s only majority Muslim state , into what will effectively be a colony ruled from Delhi , will only reinforce the growing view that in Modi \u2019 s India , Muslims are second class citizens . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s worth noting that \u201c conservative ideas were much more popular when not associated with the Republican party . In Washington State , voters narrowly rejected bringing affirmative action back to state contracting and university admissions\u2026 \u200d \u201c In Seattle , the self-proclaimed socialist city-council member appears to have lost her seat to a pro-business challenger . In Colorado , voters gave fiscal conservatives a big win by rejecting letting the state keep any tax revenues above the state spending cap , money that the state Taxpayer \u2019 s Bill of Rights currently guarantees as refunds to taxpayers . In Sussex County , N.J. , voters approved , by a 2-to-1 margin , a referendum directing the local freeholder board to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement . ( Washington , Colorado , New Jersey \u2014 notice these are places where Republican candidates have had no luck lately . ) \u201d\n\u201c If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday\u2014shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production\u2014imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy . In recent decades , the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment . Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors ? \u2026 the nation does not want another war . How we avoid it , however , is becoming difficult to see . John Bolton may be gone from the West Wing , but his soul is marching on . \u201d\nOthers note , \u201c I \u2019 d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame .
