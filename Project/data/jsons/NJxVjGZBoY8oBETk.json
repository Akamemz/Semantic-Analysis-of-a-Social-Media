Here's Why\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Yuri Gripas/AFP/Getty Images Yuri Gripas/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe GOP may be in the midst of an identity crisis, but the Democratic Party is also facing a political crisis that could be made a lot worse if it doesn't win the White House in November.\n\nHere's why:\n\nPart of President Obama's legacy is the health of his party. He's had many successes in office \u2014 health care reform, climate change regulations, Wall Street reform \u2014 but his legacy will also include one huge failure: a diminished Democratic Party.\n\nEvery president sees his party lose hundreds of positions \u2014 it's the price a party holding the White House pays \u2014 but no president has come close to Obama. During Obama's eight years in office, the Democrats have lost more House, Senate, state legislative and governors seats than under any other president.\n\nWhen Obama took office, there were 60 Democratic senators; now there are 46. The number of House seats held by Democrats has shrunk from 257 to 188.\n\nThere are now nine fewer Democratic governors than in 2009. Democrats currently hold fewer elected offices nationwide than at any time since the 1920s.\n\nHow did this happen?\n\n1. There are two different electorates in America\n\nThere is Presidential Election America, where turnout is diverse. The electorate is younger, browner, more single, more secular \u2014 more Democratic. Then there's Midterm Election America, where the electorate is older, whiter, more rural, more church-going \u2014 in other words, more Republican. What's great for Republicans and bad for Democrats is that the vast majority of the governorships and state legislative seats are elected in the midterms.\n\nAnd those positions are the seed corn for a party \u2014 they're the farm teams for higher-level offices. Right now the Democrats are at a very low ebb.\n\nThis is something President Obama lamented when he campaigned for Democrats in the midterm elections of 2010 and 2014. Republicans manage to turn out their voters every two years, but Democrats, for some reason, only turn their voters out every four. Maybe, Obama mused, because Democrats just don't think midterms are \"sexy enough.\"\n\n2. Bad luck\n\nDemocrats had one spectacularly bad piece of luck. The Republicans' Tea Party-fueled surge in 2010 was perfectly timed to coincide with the decennial census, after which new congressional and state legislative district boundaries are drawn by governors and state legislatures. Republicans' huge gains in the 2010 midterms put them in the driver's seat when it came time to draw new congressional districts in 2011. Former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell remembers what happened when Republicans took over the governor's mansion and the Legislature in his state:\n\n\"When I left office in January of 2011,\" says Rendell, \"there were 13 Democratic congressman and six Republican congressman. As a result of redistricting in the 2010 election, that turned around and we now have 13 Republican congressmen and five Democratic congressman.\"\n\n3. Democrats don't care\n\nIt's not only bad timing and gerrymandering that have hollowed out the Democratic Party. Mo Elleithee, a former Democratic National Committee official, says Democrats have never put enough effort and resources into state legislative races. Republicans, on the other hand, make those races a top priority.\n\n4. Too many Democrats live in cities\n\nThis is another problem that makes it easier for Republicans to draw congressional and state legislative districts that disadvantage Democrats. Democratic voters are clumped together in urban areas. You could say that for the purposes of winning elections, Democratic voters are just not efficiently distributed.\n\nIts why even in red states like Texas and Utah there are cities that are solidly Democratic \u2014 and why lesbian mayors were elected in Houston and Salt Lake City. When Democrats cluster in and around cities, they win local elections, but that doesn't help them win suburban or rural congressional seats.\n\nThis November, the stakes for Democrats couldn't be higher. Without the White House, assuming party control elsewhere remains the same, Democrats would be truly out in the cold.",
