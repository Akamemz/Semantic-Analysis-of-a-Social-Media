Obama plan: Divide and conquer GOP\n\nPresident Barack Obama broke Republicans once on taxes \u2014 and his risky strategy for winning the sequester fight assumes he\u2019ll do it again.\n\nHe will divide, isolate and defeat Republicans using all the powers of his office and all his skills as a political campaigner. As Americans grow frustrated with the cuts, Republicans will reject their party\u2019s no-tax mantra and demand that Congress end the standoff, even if it means raising some new revenue \u2013 just the way Obama is demanding.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nObama\u2019s trying to speed this result, by releasing state by state details of the pain and suffering the sequester will cause, all meant to get Republicans to cave. And he\u2019s got the biggest megaphone, hammering this message over and over in a way the divided Republican party cannot.\n\n( WATCH: Team Obama drives home sequester messaging)\n\nExcept that message could cut both ways.\n\nWhat if the public agrees that yes, there is a lot of pain and suffering \u2013 and turns to Obama wondering, why didn\u2019t you do more to prevent it? That\u2019s what makes some Democrats nervous about the White House\u2019s supreme level of confidence.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers, who are unclear about the end game, could succumb to the same public offensive that Obama has been ginning up against Republicans and start demanding that the White House cut its losses and move on to other important second-term initiatives. A GOP proposal to give flexibility to the agency heads on deciding how to administer the cuts could start looking attractive to Democrats as a way out.\n\n( PHOTOS: What they\u2019re saying about sequestration)\n\nBut Obama is certain of his strategy there, too. He believes the results of the November election show that the public endorses his vision, and that he label Republicans as the protectors of the rich who stubbornly refuse to adopt his fair \u201cbalanced\u201d approach of cuts and new revenues.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re already starting to see some Republicans grow increasingly uncomfortable with the current position of the leadership of their party.
