    "content": "The Senate Intelligence Committee has just released the first section of its report on 2016 Russian interference , which found that hackers likely tried to access election systems in all 50 states , confirming widespread fears that America \u2019 s election system may not be secure from attack .\nFor the past two and a half years , the panel led by Chair Sen. Richard Burr ( R-NC ) and Vice Chair Sen. Mark Warner ( D-VA ) has reviewed the intelligence that the Kremlin sought to meddle in the last presidential election , an effort separate from the highly partisan probe in the House that ended in 2018 and found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia .\nThe document released on Thursday afternoon \u2014 one day after former special counsel Robert Mueller testified in front of Congress on his effort \u2014 is not the entirety of the committee \u2019 s findings . It \u2019 s one of five volumes the panel will release over the coming month . This report focuses specifically on Russian efforts to infiltrate election infrastructure \u2014 that is , the actual systems that allow citizens to vote across the country .\nThe heavily redacted report contains almost entirely known information , so in that sense it \u2019 s not a bombshell document . But it does detail how Russia \u201c directed extensive activity , beginning in at least 2014 and carrying into at least 2017 , against US election infrastructure at the state and local level . \u201d\nIt underscores two vital points : 1 ) that determined foreign actors can gain access to America \u2019 s election infrastructure , and 2 ) Russia is skilled and willing to meddle inside of it .\n\u201c The facts are clear : The Russian government mounted a deliberate and systematic attack on America \u2019 s election infrastructure in 2016 , \u201d Sen. Kamala Harris ( D-CA ) , a member of the committee and a 2020 presidential candidate , said in an emailed statement to reporters .\nThe US election system is a labyrinth . The voting process is overseen by a mix of state and local governments that use different machines , software , and processes to count votes . The fact that it \u2019 s such a complicated hodgepodge for years made experts optimistic that it would be difficult for a hostile actor to seriously infiltrate .\nThey should be worried now . The key part of the report shows that it \u2019 s very likely all 50 states were targeted by Russian hackers . That doesn \u2019 t meant Moscow got into all of the states \u2019 systems , just that it infiltrated at least one system in that state .
