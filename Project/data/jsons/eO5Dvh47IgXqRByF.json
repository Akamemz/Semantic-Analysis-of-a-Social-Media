He went after a new target \u2014 Scott Walker , calling his state a \u201c disaster \u201d and ripping the Wisconsin governor \u2019 s fiscal policies . He regaled the crowd with tales of Thursday \u2019 s circus-like trip to Laredo , Texas , where he toured the border and showcased his provocative attacks on illegal immigrants . He spent the rest of his time lamenting the state of the country while touting what an amazing businessman he is .\n\u201c Who can do better than Trump ? \u201d Trump said . \u201c I fix things . \u201d\nHours away from Oskaloosa , former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton held about as different a campaign event as one can get .\nUnder a big sycamore tree on the grounds of the Madison County Historical Complex \u2014 a stone \u2019 s throw from the birthplace of John Wayne \u2014 Clinton met with an intimate group of less than 100 Third District Iowa Democrats .\n\u201c It \u2019 s very nostalgic , \u201d Clinton \u2014 skipping her trademark pantsuit for a more casual striped shirt and slacks \u2014 said of the intimate gathering . \u201c I spent all those years with Bill in Arkansas and we used to campaign under trees from one part of state to the other . We were outdoors all the time . We were in cattle barns , rodeos , wherever two or more gathered . We had so much fun .
