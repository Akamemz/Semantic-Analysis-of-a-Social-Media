It stretches from Turkey to rebel-held eastern Aleppo , where 250,000 civilians are facing shortages of food , water , and medicine .

''\nUnder the terms of the ceasefire pact , the Syrian troops who have held the road since July and the rebels who \u2019 ve been fighting to take it back ever since were supposed to pull back from the highway , allowing aid convoys to make their way to Aleppo .
