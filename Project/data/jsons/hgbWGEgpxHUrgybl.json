Last night , the 15 pages of documents that then-FBI Director James Comey had in meetings with President Trump in the final months of his tenure at the FBI . These documents were critical in the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel to takeover the ongoing Russia investigation at the DOJ/FBI ; the FBI \u2019 s counterintelligence investigation into Russian collusion and the Trump campaign began in July of 2016 . It \u2019 s pretty innocuous stuff , and contains none of the nefarious elements the liberal media and the progressive Democratic base probably listed for throughout this investigation , which has yet to produce strong evidence that there was collusion between the Trump team and the Kremlin .\nJames Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION . Also , he leaked classified information . WOW ! Will the Witch Hunt continue ? \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) April 20 , 2018\n\u201c No collusion and no obstruction , \u201d President Trump tweeted upon the revelation of these documents . So , here \u2019 s a brief breakdown of its contents ( via Axios ) :\nDuring their private dinner : \u201c The conversation , which was pleasant at all times , was chaotic , with topics touched , left , then returned to later , making it very difficult to recount in a linear fashion\u2026It really was a conversation-as-jigsaw-puzzle in a way , with pieces picked up , then discarded , then returned to. \u201d Comey writes that Trump asked him `` whether 'your guy McCabe ' has a problem with me , explaining that ' I was pretty rough on him and his wife during the campaign . ' I explained that Andy was a true professional and had no problem at all . '' After asking Comey to get out that Trump was not under investigation , he followed up with a phone call , per the memos : `` I said that ... he should have the White House Counsel call the Acting Attorney General and make the request . He said that was what he would do . He then added , `` Because I have been very loyal to you , very loyal , we had that thing , you know . '' I did not reply , or ask him what he meant by `` that thing . '' Comey told Trump during the dinner : `` [ H ] e could count on me to always tell him the truth . I said I do n't do sneaky things . I do n't leak . I do n't do weasel moves . I was not on anybody 's side politically and could not be counted on in that traditional political sense . '' On Mike Flynn , Trump told Comey : `` ' I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go , to letting Flynn go . He is a good guy . I hope you can let this go . ' I replied by saying ' I agree he is a good guy , ' but said no more . '' Comey said to Trump , while discussing leaks , `` something about the value of putting a head on a pike as a message . He replied by saying it may involve putting reporters in jail . 'They spend a couple days in jail , make a new friend , and they are ready to talk . ' '' On the dossier : `` The President said 'the hookers thing ' is nonsense but that Putin had told him 'we have some of the most beautiful hookers in the world . ' ( He did not say when Putin told him this and I do n't recall . ) ''\nThere are other tidbits , some funny , while others show the ex-FBI chief trashing his colleagues at the Department of Justice .
