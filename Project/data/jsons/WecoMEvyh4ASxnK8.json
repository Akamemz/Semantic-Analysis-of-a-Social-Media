    "content": "There has been a lot of talk lately about a few COVID-19 studies that use antibody testing to estimate the prevalence of infection across the population . In theory , antibody tests detect evidence that a person has already had and recovered from COVID-19 , which , given the lack of available testing while people are still experiencing symptoms ( or may be experiencing only mild symptoms , if they aren \u2019 t completely asymptomatic ) , can be a useful tool for estimating the full scope of the pandemic .\nIn particular , a study of prevalence rates in Santa Clara County , California , has attracted attention for its conclusion that the prevalence of people with antibodies\u2014meaning people who have been infected and gotten better\u2014is much higher than official estimates .\nAntibody studies are garnering interest because they might help us estimate who has immunity against COVID-19 , which could be useful as states look to open up again\u2014particularly as we work our way toward potential \u201c herd immunity. \u201d But putting too much faith into a study suggesting a low death rate\u2014particularly one that doesn \u2019 t account for flaws and biases in its data\u2014could lead people to think the disease is less dangerous than it really is .\nHerd Immunity Wo n't Save Us If we can not stop COVID-19 , can we at least look forward to the point in time when we are all\u2026 Read more\nIn the Santa Clara study , 3,330 people were recruited through Facebook ads and tested for antibodies against the virus that causes COVID-19 . Out of these 3,330 people , 50 tested positive . Extrapolating from this number , the authors estimate that the prevalence of people who have recovered from the disease in Santa Clara County is 50 to 85 times what the official numbers suggested . Using this number , authors have estimated the death rate from COVID-19 to be between 0.12-0.20 , versus other estimates , which typically range between 1-3 % . Assessing the death rate for this disease is tricky , given how new it is , as well as the lack of widespread testing . But overall , in scenarios where there have been higher rates of testing , the death rate seems to be somewhere in that 1-3 % range .\nThe Santa Clara study \u2019 s results were startling , and have not held up to the scrutiny that followed the initial , heartening headlines .
