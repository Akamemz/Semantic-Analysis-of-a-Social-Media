    "content": "Hundreds of thousands of people die of the flu every year , some say , and people need to calm down about coronavirus , which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization this week . On Friday , President Trump declared a national emergency .\nSo what do we do now ? Everyone should wash their hands for 20 seconds , elbow bump , stop buying face masks because they don \u2019 t protect against the virus , note that airplane air is filtered 20 to 30 times an hour , avoid cruise ships , and just relax .\nThat appears to be the accumulated advice of exasperated Americans on Twitter and Facebook FB , +2.02 % just a week or two ago who despaired at the long lines at Trader Joe \u2019 s and Whole Foods AMZN , +7.53 % ( where people apparently have been stocking up on oat milk ) , and the panic buying and empty shelves at Costco COST , +7.02 % .\n\u201c Toilet paper is golden in an apocalypse , \u201d one customer told MYNorthwest.com .\nTrump last week announced that he was \u201c marshaling the full power of the federal government \u201d by suspending all travel from Europe to the U.S. for one month . It may seem like a lifetime ago now , given declarations of \u201c bearmaggedon \u201d and that airlines face their biggest financial crisis in a generation , but a couple of days earlier , Trump wrote on Twitter TWTR , +3.91 % , \u201c Last year 37,000 Americans died \u201d from the flu : \u201c Nothing is shut down , life & the economy go on . \u201d\n\u201c \u2018 This is additive , not in place of . Yes , the flu kills thousands of people every year , but we \u2019 re going to have more deaths. \u2019 \u201d \u2014 Amesh Adalja , Infectious Diseases Society of America\nAs this dramatic change-of-heart illustrates , we still have a lot to learn about the novel coronavirus and , experts say , that alone should be enough to motivate communities to work together to slow its progress . Studies suggest the differences between the flu and coronavirus are more nuanced than some people suggest .\nIn fact , health professionals point out important distinctions between COVID-19 , the disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 , and other viruses . They don \u2019 t advise mass hysteria , obviously , but nor do they believe doing nothing and/or going about your business as usual is a smart move either .\nWHO finally said last week that coronavirus has become a pandemic . WHO had characterized the illness late last year as a series of epidemics . An epidemic is a disease that infects regions or a community . The 1918-19 \u201c Spanish flu \u201d and Black Death from 1347 to 1351 were two of the most extreme pandemics recorded in modern and medieval times .\nDispatches from the front lines of a pandemic : \u2018 They \u2019 ve likened it to a war where the number of casualties just keep on coming \u2019 : Italians find solidarity , resilience and music during the coronavirus lockdown\nSo what are the differences between coronavirus and the flu ? For starters , there is no vaccine for COVID-19 and it could take many months or years to get one to market , and , unlike the influenza viruses for which there are several vaccines , humans have not built up an immunity over multiple generations . What \u2019 s worse , doctors fear the virus will mutate .\nThe first known person was reported to have contracted the virus on Dec. 1 in China . Today , it \u2019 s spread to approximately 130 countries or territories . Experts advise changing your behavior to limit its spread . Public officials in New York have said people should avoid taking mass transit , if possible . Italy has effectively quarantined its entire population . Israel , among other countries , has closed its land borders .\nOf course , there are similarities between influenza and COVID-19 . Both viruses are untreatable with antibiotics , and they have almost identical symptoms \u2014 fever , coughing , night sweats , aching bones , tiredness and , in more severe cases of both viruses , nausea and even diarrhea . They can be spread by touching your face , coughing and sneezing .\nBut doctors say their differences are just as varied . \u201c It \u2019 s a little simple to think the novel coronavirus is just like flu , \u201d Amesh Adalja , a senior scholar at the John Hopkins Center for Health Security and a spokesman for the Infectious Diseases Society of America , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t want another flu , \u201d he said . \u201c This is additive , not in place of . Yes , the flu kills thousands of people every year , but we \u2019 re going to have more deaths . \u201d\nDispatches from the front lines of a pandemic : \u2018 The lack of an all-island response has also rattled communities on both sides of the Irish border. \u2019 Pubs close due to coronavirus , government issues new strict rules for funerals\nThere are reported to be some 1 billion influenza infections worldwide each year , with up to 45 million cases in the U.S. per year , tens of thousands of U.S. deaths , and 291,000 to 646,000 deaths worldwide .\nSeasonal flu has a fatality rate of less than 1 % . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases on Capitol Hill , estimates that the fatality rate of flu is closer to 0.1 % . But even accounting for the mild , yet undiagnosed cases of COVID-19 , he said Wednesday , it would still make it \u201c roughly 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu . \u201d\nAnother reason not to compare the two viruses : Influenza has likely been around for more than 2,000 years . Scientists say the \u201c novel influenza A viruses \u201d in humans lead to a pandemic approximately once every 40 years . But , again , flu vaccines exist . \u201c The flu has been with us since the birth of modern medicine , \u201d said Adalja .\n\u201c Flu has likely been around for 2,000 years . This coronavirus is three months old and , as yet , there is no vaccine . \u201d\nHippocrates of Kos , the Greek physician who was born around 460 BC , mentioned what we now know as the modern influenza virus in his writings , some historians say . He called it the \u201c Fever of Perinthus. \u201d Others wonder whether this was flu , another illness , or a combination of illnesses .\n\u201c In 1173 and 1500 , two other influenza outbreaks were described , though in scant detail . The name \u2018 influenza \u2019 originated in the 15th century in Italy , from an epidemic attributed to the \u2018 influence of the stars , \u2019 \u201d which , according to historical documents , \u201c raged across Europe and perhaps in Asia and Africa , \u201d a 2016 paper in the Journal of Preventive Medicine and Hygiene reported .\n\u201c Scholars and historians debate whether influenza was already present in the New World or whether it was carried by contaminated pigs transported on ships , \u201d it added . \u201c Some Aztec texts speak of a \u2019 pestilential catarrh \u2019 outbreak in 1450-1456 in an area now corresponding to Mexico , but these manuscripts are difficult to interpret correctly and this hypothesis seems controversial . \u201d\nWhat has all this got to do with COVID-19 ? There is an advantage to coming down with a virus that has been around for hundreds , if not a couple of thousand , years . Humans , ideally , will have built up more natural defenses to fight it .\nComplicating matters : influenza and COVID-19 come from different virus families , and COVID-19 is brand new . \u201c There are four other strains of the coronavirus , but the attack rate of this virus is relatively high as there is no immunity to it , \u201d Adalja said .\nDispatches from the front lines of a pandemic : As coronavirus cases rise in Switzerland , residents keep wary eye on Italy \u2019 s worsening situation next door\nTo put that in perspective : In 2017\u201318 , the worst flu season on record in the U.S. outside of a pandemic , approximately 80,000 Americans died . The four other coronavirus strains that already exist are responsible for around 25 % of our common colds , Adalja added .\n\u201c But it doesn \u2019 t seem like there is cross-immunity with this coronavirus as there are with the other coronaviruses , \u201d he added . In other words , the natural defense systems in our body that help us ward off flu are unlikely to apply here .\nLuis Ostrosky , a member of the Infectious Diseases Society of America , said humans have a \u201c herd immunity \u201d to flu . \u201c When there are enough people in the community who are immune it protects people who are not immune. \u201d That is the case with flu , but not with COVID-19 . Ostrosky said this is especially critical when no vaccines or therapeutic treatments for a virus .\n\u201c Both can be spread from person to person through droplets in the air from an infected person coughing , sneezing or talking , \u201d Lisa Maragakis , senior director of infection prevention at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore , wrote . Based on the estimated distance viruses travel , scientists recommend \u201c social distancing \u201d of at least six feet in enclosed public spaces .\nIn the meantime , the virus continues to spread , likely helped by people who have mild symptoms or who are asymptomatic .\nAs of Tuesday afternoon , there were 190,140 confirmed cases globally and 7,519 deaths , according to data the latest rally from the database of Johns Hopkins University \u2019 s Center for Systems Science and Engineering ; the database also reported 80,648 recoveries . The U.S. has had at least 5,218 confirmed coronavirus cases and 94 deaths .\nNeither the flu nor COVID-19 viruses is treatable with antibiotics , and the two illnesses have roughly identical symptoms . \u2588\u2588\u2588 photo illustration/iStockphoto\nWhile estimates of coronavirus fatality rates vary , they remain far higher than those for the flu . COVID-19 has a fatality rate of 3.4 % , WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said earlier this month . That \u2019 s more than previous estimates of between 1.4 % and 2 % , although some observers say his analysis was a blunt interpretation of incomplete data , and were probably skewed by a higher death rate in China .\nCOVID-19 rates may fall closer to those of the flu , assuming many more people are infected . JAMA recently released this paper analyzing data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 72,314 COVID-19 cases in mainland China last month , the largest such sample of this kind . The sample \u2019 s overall case-fatality rate was 2.3 % , in line with the earlier estimates .\n\u201c \u2018 As coronavirus spreads it threatens to put a much greater burden on health systems than flu does. \u2019 \u201d \u2014 Antigone Barton , ScienceSpeaks\nFatality rates also varied dramatically depending on the age of the individual . No deaths occurred in those 9 and younger , but cases in those aged 70 to 79 carried an 8 % fatality rate , and those aged 80 years and older had a fatality rate of 14.8 % . The rate was 49 % among critical cases , and elevated among those with pre-existing conditions , to between 5.6 % and 10.3 % , depending on the condition .\nOther differences between coronavirus and flu lie in what we don \u2019 t know . Adults with the flu , which has an average incubation period of two days , can infect others 24 hours before symptoms develop and 5 to 7 days after becoming sick . Novel coronavirus has a median incubation period of 5.1 days , longer than that other human coronaviruses ( 3 days ) that cause the common cold .\nThe agency said the number of cases outside China has increased tenfold and the number of countries affected has tripled . \u201c We expect to see the number of cases , the number of deaths and the number of affected countries climb even higher . WHO has been assessing this outbreak around the clock , \u201d Tedros told reporters . \u201c And we \u2019 re deeply concerned . Most by the alarming levels of spread and severity . And by the alarming levels of inaction . \u201d\nCoronavirus appears to be transmitted with ease to around 2.3 people by each person infected in the community , said Antigone Barton , editor of ScienceSpeaks , a medical website . Drug companies and the medical community , she said , are scrambling to come up with a vaccine before more people die , and health services are overwhelmed with sick people showing up at their doors .\nThe potential demand for hospital beds , ventilators , masks and medications , and the pressure all of this would put on staff worries her . \u201c Because there \u2019 s no proven therapy or vaccine ; as coronavirus spreads , \u201d Barton said , \u201c it threatens to put a much greater burden on health systems than flu does , and greater than most or many are prepared for . \u201d",
