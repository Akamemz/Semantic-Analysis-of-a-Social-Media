And should those efforts fail, many prominent Republicans are saying they won\u2019t support Trump if he is the nominee. Some are even floating the idea of an anti-Trump third party.\n\nMost times, even after fierce nomination battles and raucous conventions, parties have come together for the general-election fight. The bitter 1952 convention fight between Dwight Eisenhower and Sen. Robert Taft didn\u2019t hurt Eisenhower that fall. In 1976, after Ronald Reagan fell just short of taking the GOP nomination from President Gerald Ford, he endorsed Ford in a memorable concession speech (although Ford went on to lose to Jimmy Carter in an exceedingly close race that November). And in 1968, even after a violence-marred convention and the third-party challenge of George Wallace, enough of the Democratic coalition came together in time for Hubert Humphrey to almost defeat Richard Nixon.\n\nWhile it\u2019s been a long time since a significant portion of a major party has rejected its own leading candidate, it\u2019s hardly unprecedented in American political history. Here\u2019s a rundown of notable splits, bolts, splinters and other major-party schisms, starting with the birth of the modern Democratic/Republican era. (Note: We excluded third-party movements, such as Wallace\u2019s 1968 campaign and Ross Perot\u2019s 1992 run, that originated outside the two major parties and weren\u2019t explicit rejections of a particular nominee.)\n\n1860: After no fewer than three conventions, Democrats split into Northern and Southern wings over the issue of slavery. Each wing nominated its own candidates for president and vice president, but the split virtually ensured the victory of Republican nominee Abraham Lincoln.\n\n1864: A group of Radical Republicans, dissatisfied with Lincoln\u2019s leadership during the Civil War, broke away and formed their own \u201cRadical Democracy Party.\u201d They nominated explorer and former Army general John C.
