Pushed to respond , the Trump-supporting former congressman lashed out at Kelly and accused polling organizations and mainstream political analysts of being biased against his candidate .\n\u201c They \u2019 re not nonpartisan outlets , \u201d Gingrich asserted . \u201c Every outlet you described is part of the establishment . \u201d\nNoting that he had included Fox News \u2019 political desk in his indictment , Kelly pushed back : \u201c Fox News ? Really , are we ? I don \u2019 t think so . \u201d\nRetorted Gingrich : \u201c Oh come on ! \u201d He then asserted that given his many years in politics , he didn \u2019 t \u201c take polls as seriously as people who \u2019 ve never run for office . \u201d\nThat much certainly is true . In 2012 , Gingrich was similarly skeptical of the many surveys that showed President Barack Obama ahead of that year \u2019 s Republican nominee , Mitt Romney . Interviewed by Greta Van Susteren , the former House speaker predicted that Romney would win the presidency with at least 53 percent of the popular vote and more than 300 electoral votes .\nThat \u2019 s not quite what happened . Romney finished with just more than 47 percent of the popular vote and won only 206 electoral votes .\nAfter ripping the fairness and honesty of Fox News \u2019 data geeks , the defensive Gingrich moved on to attacking Kelly , using similar language that her intramural rival Sean Hannity has used to imply that she secretly supports Clinton .\n\u201c I know where you \u2019 re coming from , \u201d he said , after Kelly argued that Trump has been harming himself by his own actions . Gingrich then turned to attacking the media in general for providing too much coverage of the Republican candidate \u2019 s recorded remarks about kissing and grabbing women \u2019 s genitals in comparison to some controversial speeches that Hillary Clinton gave to banking companies .\nKelly interrupted him : \u201c If Donald Trump is sexual predator \u2014 \u201d she began to ask .\n\u201c He \u2019 s not a sexual predator ! \u201d Gingrich exploded , apparently missing that his host had included the word if in her sentence . \u201c You can \u2019 t say that ! You could not defend that statement ! \u201d\nThe enraged former congressman continued : \u201c I am sick and tired of people like you using language that \u2019 s inflammatory that \u2019 s not true ! \u201d\nKelly calmly responded , \u201c I \u2019 m not taking a position on it . \u201d\n\u201c Yes you are , \u201d Gingrich replied . \u201c When you used the words , you took a position . And I think it \u2019 s very unfair of you to do that , Megyn . I think that \u2019 s exactly the bias people are upset by . \u201d\nThe exchange could have continued like that , probably for quite a while , had not Kelly stepped in and emphatically let the Trump-supporting Republican know that she was asking a question , not making a statement . He finally relented but reverted to attacking the amount of time that television news operations have spent on covering the sexual assault allegations against Trump in comparison to the Clinton remarks . Kelly said that she had covered the Clinton speeches .\nGingrich disagreed : \u201c You are fascinated with sex and you don \u2019 t care about public policy . That \u2019 s what I get out of watching you tonight . \u201d\nKelly took the insult in stride , quietly laughing it off and then parried : \u201c You know what , Mr. Speaker ? I \u2019 m not fascinated by sex .
