    "content": "( CNN ) The Senate early Wednesday morning approved rules for the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump on a party-line vote that delays the question of whether the Senate should subpoena witnesses and documents until later in the trial .\nThe rules resolution from Senate Majority Mitch McConnell was approved 53-47 after Republicans defeated a series of amendments from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on the opening day of the bitterly fought impeachment trial . Schumer proposed 11 amendments seeking to subpoena a trove of documents from the Trump administration and witnesses like acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton , but the amendments were thwarted almost entirely by the same party-line vote , 53-47 .\nAs the debate continued into the early hours of Wednesday morning , tempers increasingly began to flare . Chief Justice John Roberts admonished both the House managers and the President 's lawyers after a particularly heated back and forth with House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler , White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow . Roberts said he was admonishing the two sides `` in equal terms to remember that they are addressing the world 's greatest deliberative body . ''\nSchumer 's amendments are part of an effort from Democrats in both the House and Senate to attack the resolution laying out the rules of the trial , which puts off a decision about seeking witnesses and documents until after opening statements are given and senators have a chance to ask questions of the House impeachment managers and the President 's legal team .\n`` The McConnell rules seem to be designed by President Trump for President Trump . It asks the Senate to rush through as fast as possible and makes getting evidence as hard as possible , '' Schumer said on the Senate floor Tuesday . `` The McConnell resolution will result in a rushed trial with little evidence in the dark of night . ''\nThe debate over the trial rules played out after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell decided to alter the trial resolution shortly before it gaveled in Tuesday , amid concerns from key Senate Republicans and an uproar from Democrats .\nThe new resolution will give the House impeachment managers and the President 's team three days each to make their 24 hours of trial arguments , instead of two as McConnell had initially proposed . There were also changes to the section of the resolution that would not have admitted the House 's evidence without a vote \u2014 now , evidence will be admitted automatically unless there is a motion from the President 's team to throw out evidence .\nBut the changes did little to satisfy Democrats in either chamber , who have accused McConnell and Senate Republicans of working with the President to rush through the impeachment trial .\nDemocrats erupted when McConnell 's four-page organizing resolution was released Monday night , dividing 24 hours over two days for opening arguments , delaying the question of witnesses until after the arguments were completed and requiring a vote for the House evidence to be submitted . Despite the changes , Democrats on Tuesday pushed for the Senate to obtain documents and witness testimony at the outset .\n`` If the Senate votes to deprive itself of witnesses and documents , the opening statements will be the end of the trial , '' House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff , the lead impeachment manager and a California Democrat , said during the trial debate Tuesday , `` So to say , 'Let 's just have the opening statements and then we 'll see , ' means let 's have the trial , and maybe we can just sweep this all under the rug . ''\nTwo GOP aides said the changes McConnell made were the result of concerns from moderate Republicans . The alterations were hand-written into the resolution \u2014 a sign they were hastily put together before the trial began early Tuesday afternoon .\nRepublican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and other colleagues `` raised concerns about the 24 hours of opening statements in two days and the admission of the House transcript is the record , '' Annie Clark , a Collins spokeswoman , told CNN . `` Her position has been that the trial should follow the Clinton model as much as possible . She thinks these changes are a significant improvement . ''\nCollins did break with Republicans on one amendment vote , joining with Democrats on the 10th amendment to allow the sides 24 hours to respond to the trial motions that are due Wednesday morning . It failed 52-48 .\nThe move is a sign of how closely McConnell , who can not afford to lose more than four GOP senators to keep control of the trial , is keeping the pulse of the moderates in his conference .\nSchumer 's amendments sought subpoenas for a host of documents related to Ukraine , including those tied to the President 's calls with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky , discussion of investigations related to the Bidens and Burisma , and the freezing of US security assistance to Ukraine . The amendments included calls to subpoena the White House , National Security Council , State Department and OMB for documents .\nJUST WATCHED Schumer : McConnell proposing an 'Alice in Wonderland ' trial Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Schumer : McConnell proposing an 'Alice in Wonderland ' trial 01:24\nBut McConnell said on the Senate floor before the trial began that he has the votes from Republicans to move forward . McConnell said his proposal tracked closely with President Bill Clinton 's 1999 impeachment trial that was `` fair , even-handed and tracks closely with past precedents .
