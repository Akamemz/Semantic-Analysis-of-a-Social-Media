    "content": "The White House press secretary is aggressive , antagonistic and flustered . And , in the spotlight of live TV , he can appear to be channeling his pugnacious master\nEvery visitor says it \u2019 s smaller than they expected . The modest James S Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House fills with about a hundred journalists , half in the fixed seats , half standing in the aisles or at the back . Each lunchtime there is an expectant murmur , like a theatre audience before curtain up . TV reporters stand at the front , each speaking directly to camera and contriving to ignore the others standing inches away .\nSeconds after they sign off , in walks the star of the show : Sean Spicer , the White House press secretary . The thickset 45-year-old will often begin with a genial pleasantry \u2013 \u201c Hope everyone had a great weekend , seriously , \u201d he said last Monday \u2013 that belies the vituperative fusillades set to follow . Many men and women have stood at the podium but there has never quite been anything like this for event television .\nDeflect and distract : Sean Spicer pivots to Obama in escalating Russia scandal Read more\n\u201c Sean Spicer has gone almost to a hundred days with standing room only and I find that many people stop me on the street and say , \u2018 I saw you on Sean Spicer \u2019 as if they \u2019 re saying , \u2018 I saw you on Doctor Who , \u2019 \u201d said John Gizzi , chief political correspondent at Newsmax , one of the conservative outlets now regularly called upon to ask questions .\nThis was a vintage week for viewers . On Tuesday , Spicer expressed his frustration by saying : \u201c If the president puts Russian salad dressing on his salad tonight , somehow that \u2019 s a Russian connection. \u201d He also clashed with reporter April Ryan , admonishing : \u201c Please stop shaking your head \u201d \u2013 a churlish comment that earned rebukes from Hillary Clinton and several journalists ( Ryan herself tweeted : \u201c Lawd ! ! ! ! \u201d ) . The following day Spicer gave Ryan the opening question , perhaps in coded apology .\nOn Friday he repeatedly berated reporters for focusing on Donald Trump \u2019 s alleged links to Russia rather than the president \u2019 s allegation that Barack Obama \u2019 s administration leaked classified information about him . Maggie Haberman of the New York Times tweeted : \u201c This is the most SNL yet of these briefings \u201d \u2013 a reference to TV comedy show Saturday Night Live , in which actor Melissa McCarthy parodies Spicer \u2019 s gum-chewing aggression with a motorised lectern that wreaks havoc .\nMore haunting words came from David Frum , a senior editor of the Atlantic and former speechwriter for George W Bush . \u201c The Spicer show is so fascinating precisely because he remembers when he used to have a conscience , \u201d he wrote . \u201c And the memory troubles him . \u201d\nSpicer has been in a harsh spotlight ever since the first full day of the administration , when he stormed into the briefing room and angrily insisted that the crowd size at Trump \u2019 s inauguration was bigger than Obama \u2019 s , which it was not .\nSince then , some distracting neck ties and verbal tics have emerged . On Friday he used the word \u201c interesting \u201d 10 times in an hour . A week earlier he lectured reporters \u2013 \u201c You guys are so negative ! \u201d \u2013 over the healthcare bill , which collapsed within hours . Another day he told them : \u201c At some point , I would implore , urge , beg some of you to use some of your investigative skills . \u201d\nBut perhaps Spicer \u2019 s most trusty line , covering for an unpredictable and itchy-fingered boss , is this : \u201c The president \u2019 s tweets speak for themselves . \u201d\nIt also emerged this week that Spicer is well-off . Financial disclosures released by the White House showed he held investments in McDonald \u2019 s , Walmart , Coca-Cola and Exxon Mobil and appears to have taken out four mortgages in the first 60 days of 2017 , acquiring Trump \u2019 s taste for property deals .\nSmall hand of government : Trump 's aim to shrink the state pleases conservatives Read more\nIndeed , at times he appears to be channeling his pugnacious master . Michael Cornfield , associate professor of political management at George Washington University , said : \u201c The stuff with April Ryan replicates what Trump did on the campaign trail . It \u2019 s kind of eerie in that respect . It \u2019 s like mimicry . \u201d\nCornfield said he has been watching press secretaries since Ron Ziegler , spokesman for Richard Nixon , but Spicer is unprecedented : \u201c If we \u2019 re talking about how do we try to find a context to understand Spicer , we either have to go to fiction or we have to go to his boss , because a long line of predecessors behaved very differently from this guy .\n\u201c Past press secretaries have shaded the truth or even lied but it \u2019 s usually just been on one subject or two . Spicer gives out misinformation on everything . The other big difference is how aggressive his behaviour is , which Melissa McCarthy has spoofed terrifically . He attacks .\n\u201c The others when they have to shade the truth have been defensive , which is not to say they haven \u2019 t been antagonistic \u2013 they have \u2013 but Spicer is a soldier and he \u2019 s attacking people . \u201d\nEven in TV comedies such as Veep , Cornfield said , there is not quite anyone like Spicer . \u201c When Mike McLintock , the press secretary played by Matt Walsh , has to say something untrue or he doesn \u2019 t know what he \u2019 s talking about , it \u2019 s always played for comedy . He gets flustered . But when Spicer gets flustered , there \u2019 s this level of antagonism and aggressiveness that \u2019 s not fun . \u201d\nFrank Rich , an executive producer of Veep who is also a writer-at-large for New York magazine , agreed that Spicer \u2019 s daily briefings are a unique phenomenon .\n\u201c Like everything else associated with Trump , including the president himself , watching is a form of entertainment , \u201d he said . \u201c Some people hate-watch it , I guess some people watch it with admiration , some people in my case watch it in the way one might watch a train wreck in the presidency .\n\u201c It \u2019 s been fascinating . It \u2019 s certainly something no one alive has ever seen in Washington before and it \u2019 ll be interesting to see how every fictional version of Washington on television , including the one I \u2019 m involved with , looks in relation to it to viewers . \u201d\nSpicer \u2019 s conduct has also generated comparisons to authoritarian regimes . In January Andrew Beatty , White House correspondent of Agence France-Presse , nodded towards the Zimbabwean president , Robert Mugabe , tweeting : \u201c Honestly , covering Mugabe was more straightforward than this . \u201d\nThis week , Beatty explained : \u201c Just in the sense that any question is considered an affront and their automatic response is to fight , which for the Russia investigation , for example , exacerbates the sense that they \u2019 re covering something up \u2026 they fuel suspicions by behaving suspiciously . \u201d\nThe White House press corps have tussled with the new administration over changes they believe limits access and transparency . In February , Spicer \u2019 s decision to hold an off-camera briefing with a select group of reporters \u2013 with several outlets barred \u2013 sparked an intense backlash .\nConcerns have also been raised about the growing prevalence of off-camera briefings at the White House , which in previous administrations have typically been reserved for when the press secretary is travelling with the president and must brief reporters aboard Air Force One . There has been speculation that Spicer prefers it when Trump is not watching .\nBeatty said : \u201c You can tell the difference in his behaviour on days when Trump is holding a meeting at the same time as the press conference . He \u2019 s much more relaxed , much more subdued , joking around , and you can see some days at the beginning he was getting notes and his behaviour changed when he received the notes . There were a couple of times when he left the podium very abruptly . \u201d\nAri Fleischer , who served as press secretary under Bush from 2001 to 2003 , believes televising the briefings is part of the problem . \u201c Just because it makes for juicy TV doesn \u2019 t mean it \u2019 s good for the republic , \u201d he said , noting that the behaviour of both parties \u2013 the press and the press secretary \u2013 is by nature more theatrical when the cameras are rolling .\nThe end result , he argues , is that the press secretary has to be \u201c exceptionally guarded \u201d , knowing the president is watching : \u201c You have to look for moments or openings to deliver a juicy line with panache .\nTrump and Spicer \u2019 s remarks about British \u2018 wiretapping \u2019 are absurd \u2013 and dangerous Read more\n\u201c And reporters , knowing their colleagues and editors are watching , become more confrontational .
