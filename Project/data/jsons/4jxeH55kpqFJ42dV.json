Every single time.\n\nA giant disconnect exists between the science branch and policy branch of the climate change community, obscured by a strong tribal bond that unites us against \"deniers.\" But if climate advocates get what we say we want, our own hypocrisy would soon be made painfully apparent.\n\nThe accepted policy rhetoric is that if we get to net-zero global emissions, we would \"solve\" climate change \u2014 when, in fact, this belies scientific reality.\n\nAchieving 'net zero' isn't enough\n\nLet\u2019s explain why. The term net-zero means that every ton of greenhouse gas that is currently emitted (more than 37 metric billion tons yearly) will be either eliminated outright or offset. That\u2019s a lot of fuel \u2014 heating homes, moving goods, powering industry \u2014 that needs to be replaced. Although certainly difficult, it's not impossible. But what then?

Tell us here.\n\nNet-zero will result in severe climate change; we require extreme levels of negative emissions.\n\nSo, are we doomed? Not at all.\n\nGiven this constraint, our climate change problem actually becomes much more straightforward to solve, but it limits the solution set drastically. This is an affront to the coalition of \u201call of the above\u201d and deprives many of the strongest climate advocates their favorite solutions. Trying to refute this reality is where the \"science side\" engages in denial, too.\n\nWe must remove greenhouse gases\n\nLet\u2019s work this out logically:\n\nTo stop temperature rise, greenhouse gas concentrations need to be restored to a level where temperatures will remain constant, meaning about a trillion tons of carbon dioxide need to be removed from the air.\n\nCandidates on climate change:Review how the presidential contenders would address the global challenge.\n\nNatural, biological methods of greenhouse gas removal can only work so fast \u2014 maybe a few billion tons a year \u2014 so it will take technological processes to achieve thermal balance in a meaningful time frame.\n\nThese technological processes all require energy, a lot of energy.
