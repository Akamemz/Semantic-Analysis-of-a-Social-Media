For Democrats , this was welcome news considering the bruising investigations into the attack from Republicans in Congress . The piece was trumpeted by the progressive non-profit , Media Matters in a blast email as \u201c bad news for Benghazi Hoaxers . \u201d\nBut two members of the House intelligence committee , Republican Mike Rogers and Democrat Adam Schiff , told Fox News on Sunday that U.S. intelligence assessments concluded al Qaeda did play a role in the attack . While no Republicans have asserted the Benghazi attacks were planned in a manner similar to the Sept. 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , evidence has emerged in the last year that does show the participation of militias and fighters with known ties to al Qaeda .\nAbu Khattala : The Times focuses its reporting on Ahmed Abu Khattala , a militia leader who spoke to reporter David Kirkpatrick , last year and claimed to be at the scene of the Benghazi assault with no apparent worry that he would be abducted or killed by U.S. authorities . In his piece Sunday , Kirkpatrick fills in the rest of Abu Khattala \u2019 s story , revealing that he was a part-time construction worker who was publicly associated with the abduction and murder of a rival militia commander supported by NATO . In interviews with the Times , Abu Khattala denies any connection to al Qaeda . He does however say he admires the group \u2019 s vision . The Times also discloses that Abu Khattala was close to a leader of the militia the U.S. had entrusted to protect its facilities in Benghazi in light of an attack . But Abu Khattala was by no means the only person who participated in the attack .\nThe Jamal network : Some fighters who attacked the U.S. diplomatic compound and CIA annex in Benghazi are believed to be from a group headed by a former top lieutenant to Ayman al-Zawahiri , the current leader of al Qaeda . When Egyptian authorities raided the home of Mohammed al-Jamal , who was an operational commander under al-Zawahiri \u2019 s terrorist group in the 1990s known as Egyptian Islamic Jihad , it found messages to al Qaeda leadership asking for support and plans to establish training camps and cells in the Sinai , creating a group now known as the Jamal Network .

The \u2588\u2588\u2588 first reported that an intercepted phone conversation from one of the attackers to a person connected to al Qaeda \u2019 s north Africa affiliates boasting of the attack .

The Times describes Ansar al-Sharia in Libya as a group formed in 2012 to protest the support other militias had for elections but an organization separate and distinct from al Qaeda . An August 2012 report commissioned by a Pentagon terrorism research organization found that Ansar al-Sharia \u201c has increasingly embodied al Qaeda \u2019 s presence in Libya , as indicated by its active social-media propaganda , extremist discourse , and hatred of the West , especially the United States. \u201d Not everyone however agreed .
