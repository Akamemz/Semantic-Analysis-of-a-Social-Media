Instead , he joined the CIA and spent more than two decades in the shadows , rising to take on important positions such as Bill Clinton 's intelligence briefer and CIA station chief in Saudi Arabia .\nThree years after 9/11 , Brennan became the first director of the National Counterterrorism Center , which shapes overall strategy against al Qaeda and its allies across the 16 agencies of the U.S. intelligence community .\nAfter he retired , Brennan went into the private sector , where he played an early role in advising the Obama campaign in the run-up to the 2008 election .\nIt 's this long history with Obama and his depth of experience in the intelligence community that have made Brennan the president 's pick to run the CIA .\nOn Thursday , Brennan will testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee , a milestone on the road to what is shaping up to be a contentious confirmation to be CIA director .\nAt his confirmation hearing , Brennan will be asked some tough questions about the administration 's policies on CIA drone strikes , policies that he has played a key role in formulating .\nTaking even the most conservative estimate of casualties during Brennan 's time as Obama 's top counterterrorism adviser , CIA drone strikes in Pakistan have killed 1,577 people , 143 of whom were identified in credible news reports as civilians , according to a count by the New America Foundation .\nBrennan will also likely be asked to discuss the still-classified Senate Intelligence Committee 's three-year investigation into the CIA detainee program and the extent to which coercive interrogations of some of those CIA-held prisoners elicited useful information .\nThe head of the committee , Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D-California , has said that coercive interrogations did not provide key leads in tracking down bin Laden , while a number of retired senior CIA officials have claimed that they did .\nUndoubtedly , this discrepancy will be something that the committee will want to delve into with Brennan .\nJUST WATCHED Targeting American terrorists overseas Replay More Videos ...

He would come to be nicknamed `` the pacer . '' However , the CIA could never get a photograph of the pacer 's face , nor was there any other definitive intelligence that bin Laden was living at the compound .\nBrennan , who had spent almost all of his working life at the CIA , met regularly with the analysts working on the bin Laden case . According to senior White House officials , Brennan pushed the analysts to come up with intelligence that disproved the notion that bin Laden was living in the Abbottabad compound , explaining , `` I 'm tired of hearing why everything you say confirms your case . What we need to look for are the things that tell us what 's not right about our theory . So what 's not right about your inferences ? ''\nThe analysts working on the bin Laden hunt came back to the White House one day and started their intelligence update , saying , `` Looks like there 's a dog on the compound . ''\nDenis McDonough , Obama 's then-deputy national security adviser , remembers thinking , `` Oh , that 's a bummer . You know , no self-respecting Muslim 's gon na have a dog . '' ( Many Muslims believe dogs to be `` unclean . '' )\nBrennan , who had spent much of his career focused on the Middle East and speaks Arabic , pointed out that bin Laden , in fact , did have dogs when he was living in Sudan in the mid-1990s . ( Indeed , when al Qaeda 's leader was living in the capital of Khartoum , he had taken an interest in training police dogs . )\nIn addition to pushing the CIA to refine its analysis of the case that bin Laden was living in Abbottabad , two weeks before Obama made the final decision to launch the Navy SEAL raid , Brennan authorized the formation of a `` Red Team . '' It was made up of four intelligence analysts who had had no prior role in making the case that bin Laden was living in Abbottabad .\nThe role of the Red Team was to see if there were alternative explanations that could explain the `` pattern of life '' of the mysterious residents of the Abbottabad compound . For instance : Could they be the retinue of some drug lord who was keeping a low profile ? Or might they be on the fringes of al Qaeda but unrelated to bin Laden himself ?\nOn Thursday , April 28 , 2011 , during the final National Security Council meeting to discuss what to do in Abbottabad , the Red Team briefed the president and his top advisers .\nOne of the Red Team analysts put the odds that bin Laden was living in Abbottabad at 40 % , which was discomfiting to some .\nBrennan recalls : `` Some of us thought , 'Whoa ! We thought the prospects were higher that he was in there . ' And the president recognized that when people were saying , 'Well , there 's only 40 % of a chance , ' that some people were going to get a little bit soft on this . ''\nThe uncertainty that bin Laden was even living in Abbottabad contributed to the advice that Biden and Gates gave Obama during this final National Security Council meeting : Do n't authorize the SEAL team raid . It 's just too risky .\nBy now , Brennan had come to a very different conclusion .\nHe had already told the president privately the CIA officials who had developed the intelligence on Abbottabad were `` the people that have been following bin Laden for 15 years . This has been their life 's work , this has been their life 's journey , and they feel it very much in their gut that bin Laden is at that compound . I feel pretty good , if not certain , that bin Laden is at that compound . ''\nAs the SEAL raid unfolded in Abbottabad on May 1 , 2011 , Brennan was as anxious as anyone else in the White House Situation Room : `` Might there be a quick reaction force that bin Laden may have had , security that we did n't know about ? '' he recalled thinking .\nWhen photos of the dead Osama bin Laden were passed around the Situation Room , Brennan nodded and said , `` It 's bin Laden . ''",
