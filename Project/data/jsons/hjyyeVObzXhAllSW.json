    "content": "A couple of days before Hillary Clinton won the South Carolina primary by nearly 50 points , David Plouffe eased back in his chair at an anonymous Capitol Hill hotel and declared that the woman he helped defeat in 2008 had , oh , a 98 percent chance of beating Bernie Sanders .\nHe felt pretty , pretty confident about her odds against Donald Trump , too ( predicting she could win by \u201c an unheard of margin , nationally , of 6 to 10 points \u201d ) . But Barack Obama \u2019 s puckish , intensely competitive former campaign manager , arguably the most successful Democratic strategist of his generation , offered a who-the-hell-really-knows shrug when asked to offer a similarly precise estimate of Clinton \u2019 s odds of beating Trump .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think we know yet , and I think all of us should have learned by now not to get out over ourselves with Trump , \u201d Plouffe told me during an episode of \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s \u201c Off Message \u201d podcast , in which he offered far-ranging opinions on Clinton \u2019 s self-defeating tendency to doubt her own staff , Trump \u2019 s role as an Uber-like disrupter and Bill Clinton \u2019 s not-quite-Obama-level status in the presidential pantheon .\n\u201c My sense , though is this : that he could completely implode , \u201d Plouffe said of his favorite topic \u2014 Trump \u2014 tacking on a massive caveat : \u201c So you say , well , how could someone , you know , really ferociously and viciously attack the last former Republican president and get into a worldwide verbal tango with the pope and come out OK ? Well , he did . \u2026 The Trump thing is a living , breathing , growing organism . There are no rules for how you deal with it . \u201d\nPlouffe , the archetypal no-drama Obama adviser credited with implementing Obama \u2019 s delegate-hoarding strategy eight years ago , has been informally advising Clinton and her staff as needed . Last year , \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported that he had quietly met with the soon-to-be-candidate at her Washington mansion , tracing her steps , state-by-state , and offering counsel on how to avoid the rending internal dissension that helped scuttle her race against Obama .\nPlouffe , several people in Clinton \u2019 s Brooklyn headquarters told me , speaks regularly with campaign manager Robby Mook , despite a demanding executive post at Uber that demands he travel almost constantly . Mook was checking in with Plouffe daily \u2014 sometimes multiple times a day \u2014 during Clinton \u2019 s narrow and bitterly won victory in the Iowa caucuses , they told me . Part of the problem he has identified is the sheer number of people the Clintons talk to on any given day , and the unerring certainty that each had in the quality of their own advice compared with what Mook and his team offered .\nAnd here is where the 48-year-old Delaware political marketing whiz \u2014 who was trying to be as tactful as possible in his public dispensing of criticism \u2014 described what he believes to be the biggest danger to Clinton as she grinds through the primary headlong into a bellowing , full-steam Trump .\n\u201c I think you build your team , and you stick by your team , and you run , \u201d said Plouffe . \u201c It 's got to be very hard for the Clintons . They \u2019 ve been on the scene for decades . So any time things go wrong , they have dozens of people , you know , in their email box , and probably calling , saying , \u2018 Told you so . You \u2019 ve got to do this . You \u2019 ve got to do this. \u2019 ... You \u2019 re going to have your valleys , and that \u2019 s always a test . And if the thing you do is sow internal tension and allow voices from the outside to really , I think , affect the campaign in a negative way , you may not win . \u201d\nEarly on , it seemed as though the Clintons were headed to the same dark place they inhabited for much of 2008 . Both were in a sour , question-everything mood in the days after her microscopic victory in Iowa , when it was clear Sanders was about to deliver a humbling and decisive win in New Hampshire . There was talk of accelerating a re-evaluation of staff that had been expected after Super Tuesday , or after she secured the nomination . ( Some in Clinton \u2019 s orbit even floated the nonstarter idea that Plouffe abandon his lucrative Uber gig and jump aboard the campaign . )\nDespite the finger-pointing , Clinton decided to stay the course and was rewarded with game-changing victories in Nevada and South Carolina \u2014 and Plouffe hopes she doesn \u2019 t get itchy-scratchy when things go south , as they inevitably will , in a general election fight . \u201c I think what you do need to figure out whether it \u2019 s one voice , \u201d Plouffe said of the campaign \u2019 s overall strategy \u2014 and please do away with Clinton \u2019 s propensity to summon the clans for 10-to-20-person conference calls anytime things go wrong , he urged .\n\u201c There has to be \u2014 you know , there \u2019 s the big call , and the big meeting , and then there \u2019 s the real meeting and the real call , \u201d he added . \u201c You can \u2019 t make decisions with 10 people . It \u2019 s impossible . So you \u2019 ve got to figure out , and , you know , the question is , who is she talking to ? And listen , they \u2019 ve got enormous [ talent ] : Joel Benenson [ pollster and strategist ] , Mandy [ Grunwald , Clinton ad-maker and all-around adviser ] , [ adman ] Jim Margolis , Jen Palmieri [ communications director ] . ... These are super-smart people . So I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s necessarily , you know , is there a missing person from the outside \u2026 you \u2019 ve got to commit to something . \u201d\nThe test , he says , will come during the general election , when some old Clinton hand panics and demands that either Hillary or Bill scuttle Mook \u2019 s strategy to address some crisis , real or imagined . \u201c There will be moments when there \u2019 s some bad , bull -- -- public poll that comes out that shows them tied in Pennsylvania , and , with all due respect , Ed Rendell will call , and say , \u2018 You 've got to [ abandon ] Virginia and come here for three days . \u2019 \u201d\nAt this point , Plouffe is almost certain Trump will be Clinton \u2019 s opponent : He says it \u2019 s already \u201c too late \u201d for Republicans to consolidate behind Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz , even assuming one or the other would drop out in a fit of suicidal altruism . From here on out , Trump basically needs to not implode . \u201c Remarkably , this is completely in his control . If he can land the plane , he wins , \u201d Plouffe says .\nWhile he professes to be alarmed by the developer-turned-reality-star in his capacity as an \u201c American citizen , \u201d he gets a little giddy ( not a natural Plouffian state of being ) at the process of reverse-engineering The Donald \u2019 s Teflon candidacy . \u201c If you end up with a Trump-Clinton matchup , that will be one for the ages \u201d \u2014 and one he \u2019 s pretty sure , though not entirely convinced , she \u2019 d win in a walk .\n\u201c I think that \u2019 s a likely possibility : that Hillary Clinton could beat Donald Trump by an unheard of margin , nationally , of 6 to 10 points , \u201d he says . \u201c But if that \u2019 s not the case and he \u2019 s competitive , where he \u2019 ll be competitive is in the Upper Midwest , in the Ohios , the Wisconsins , maybe Pennsylvanias of the world \u2014 maybe Iowa and Minnesota even , potentially . \u201d\nPlouffe is quick to say , \u201c From an Electoral College standpoint , I don \u2019 t see a Trump path , \u201d but he \u2019 s equally quick to say the greatest threat posed by Trump is his unpredictability . Plouffe is a guy who likes to make a plan and stick with it , and Trump makes that a near impossibility . \u201c Trump is a wild card , and you just don \u2019 t know , \u201d he adds .\nThe greatest danger is that the public continues to give Trump license to change his positions any time he likes , with minimal recrimination , and that will allow him to take popular stances outside the narrow confines of GOP orthodoxy . Plouffe thinks he \u2019 ll show openness to taxing the rich , nod toward the reality of climate change , even recognize some federal government role in providing health care to the poor .\nThe idea of deconstructing Trump appeals to Plouffe , but the aspect of his old job he misses most is playing around with the numbers .
