Already , Nevadans have received 68 visits from a flock of 2020 Democrats .\nIn past presidential cycles , Nevada has traditionally been an afterthought , sandwiched in the middle of Iowa , New Hampshire , and South Carolina . But with this year \u2019 s massive 24-person field , Nevada \u2019 s February 22 caucuses could be a game changer .\n\u201c With Nevada being the first in the West and California coming up , I think there \u2019 s going to be an inherent focus on the West , \u201d a campaign aide for former Vice President Joe Biden told me . \u201c We \u2019 re not taking that lightly . \u201d\nNevada will be crucial for two big reasons . First , the state is younger and a lot less white than Iowa and New Hampshire . With a large Hispanic/Latino population as well as substantial black and Asian American constituencies , it will be the first big test of whether candidates can appeal to a diverse electorate . Second , Nevada is the first state in the West , followed by a Super Tuesday that will include delegate-rich and Latino-heavy Texas and , for the first time , California .\nThe caucus represents a bridge between the Democratic Party \u2019 s past and its future , and there \u2019 s a distinct chance it could become a breakout state for a woman candidate or a candidate of color .\n\u201c [ It \u2019 s ] important to have early primaries for states that look like America , so that when you have a nominee , you can have someone to motivate people across the country , \u201d said Rebecca Katz , a progressive strategist and a former staffer for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid .\nThe swing state will also be a harbinger for the general election ; while Nevada increasingly leans Democratic , Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by just 2 points in 2016 . Even though much of the national press is focusing on East Coast and Midwestern states , a number of political experts say Democrats \u2019 political future lies in the West , and Nevada is the regional bellwether .\n\u201c If you want to do well in the West , you have to come to Nevada , \u201d Reid told me recently , sitting in his Las Vegas office .\nNevada is the most diverse early voting state \u2014 and it \u2019 s heavily working-class\nReid was always blunt about his reasons for getting Nevada into the roster of early states in 2006 . Simply put , he thought New Hampshire and Iowa were too white to pick the president .\n\u201c You go to New Hampshire . There are not any minorities there . Nobody lives there , \u201d Reid told the Washington Post in 2015 . \u201c You go to Iowa . There are a few people there , but again it \u2019 s a place that does not demonstrate what America is all about , for a lot of different reasons . \u201d\nReid believed diverse states in the mix would force presidential candidates to think about issues impacting nonwhite voters . He rankled party leaders in the other early states , but he also had a point \u2014 New Hampshire and Iowa are both more than 90 percent white . With a population that \u2019 s 30 percent Hispanic/Latino , 10 percent African American , and 10 percent Asian or Pacific Islander , Nevada is more representative of America as a whole .\n\u201c You \u2019 re going to get a lot of folks who have ideas of what America should look like from their perspective , instead of just the folks in Iowa or New Hampshire , \u201d said Erika Washington , executive director of Make It Work Nevada , a nonpartisan organization focused on black women \u2019 s issues . \u201c You \u2019 re going to get the voices of a lot of Latino and Hispanic folks by Nevada being the first in the West . \u201d\nNevada is also heavily working-class . A huge chunk of the state \u2019 s population works in the service industry : cooking , cleaning , and bartending for the hotels and casinos that are Nevada \u2019 s economic juggernauts .\n\u201c It is very blue-collar , partially because we \u2019 re a hospitality state , \u201d Washington said . \u201c Everyone comes here to forget their problems and cause some ruckus ... but who is cleaning up after you ? Who is making sure you are safe ? These are all blue-collar , hardworking folks who are doing it in very hot weather and who have families . \u201d\nUnions are formidable players in Nevada state politics , and none more so than the Culinary Workers Union \u2014 the same group that organized a 1991 workers strike at the Frontier Hotel that lasted more than six years . The union is highly sought after during election years . If it backs a candidate , it turns into a veritable political army , working the phones and knocking doors in Las Vegas suburbs for months .\n\u201c [ It ] is not just a great turnout machine for workers , but it \u2019 s essentially the Hispanic turnout machine , \u201d said Jon Ralston , editor of the Nevada Independent and the state \u2019 s political dean . \u201c If you can get the Culinary Union to go out for you and go out for you hard , that can be a game changer . \u201d\nPresidential candidates who come to Las Vegas have been meeting with Culinary Union leaders in hopes of getting their coveted endorsement . The union \u2019 s secretary-treasurer Geoconda Arg\u00fcello-Kline said that won \u2019 t happen for a while , but added that her members are looking for candidates with concrete plans to protect immigrants , boost the minimum wage , and make health care cheaper \u2014 not just someone who is the anti-Trump . However , there \u2019 s also evidence Trump has been a good motivator in the immigrant-heavy state : Nevada saw near-presidential year turnout during the 2018 midterms , with Latino voter turnout accounting for an impressive 18 percent of that total .\n\u201c We know Trump is racist \u2014 we know that . He doesn \u2019 t like the immigrants , \u201d said Arg\u00fcello-Kline , herself an immigrant from Nicaragua . \u201c They want to hear about the issues . \u201d\nBesides Iowa , Nevada holds the distinction of being the only other early state with a caucus . Rather than voting directly for candidates in a primary , voters who want to participate in the caucus meet at schools , community centers , or other locations across the state . Over the course of three or so hours , they try to persuade undecided voters to support their preferred candidate .\nIn past years there \u2019 s typically been one caucus day , but Nevada is hoping to expand that in 2020 with some major proposed changes . In addition to the main caucus on February 22 , the state Democratic Party wants to add four days of early voting caucuses the week before , as well as two days of virtual caucuses .\n\u201c That \u2019 s going to be a significant piece , \u201d state Democratic Party Chair William McCurdy told me , adding that the goal is to spur new voter registration and participation in 2020 . The Democratic National Committee is reviewing the proposed changes and is expected to give its decision soon . McCurdy added that the state party hasn \u2019 t yet hammered out exactly how virtual caucuses will be conducted ( it could either be through an app or over the phone ) , but said the process will be figured out later this summer .\nPresidential candidates in Nevada and Las Vegas have a unique challenge : They need to figure out how to win over voters in a town Reid \u2019 s former spokesperson Jim Manley once described as \u201c largely apathetic to politics. \u201d It could be difficult . Political experts in the state readily admit that there \u2019 s a large population of Nevadans who are checked out of the political process .\n\u201c People have never met presidential candidates and now they \u2019 re swarming here to meet people , \u201d said Nevada Democratic Party spokesperson Molly Forgey .\nPolitics here isn \u2019 t the spectator sport it is in states like New Hampshire and Iowa ; campaigning in Nevada is very different from Iowa \u2019 s relentlessly covered state fairs and New Hampshire \u2019 s political pancake breakfasts and town halls . The work of swaying unions , Latino activists , and workers that make up the state \u2019 s political \u201c shock troops \u201d means candidates literally have to go meet workers while they \u2019 re on the job , McCurdy added .\n\u201c They have to meet voters where they are , \u201d he said . \u201c Our state is wide open ; Nevada will make candidates work a little bit harder . \u201d\nIn past presidential elections , Iowa and New Hampshire have been the states that winnow out large fields of candidates . In 2016 , six GOP presidential candidates dropped out after disappointing showings in the first two states ; out of the 17 original candidates , 12 didn \u2019 t even make it to Super Tuesday .\nTo be sure , the first two states will still play this role for 2020 Democrats , especially with a 24-person field . But some top-tier candidates are already making the calculation that they won \u2019 t win Iowa and New Hampshire , and are gaming out national strategies that largely leave out the first two states in favor of staking out a different path in the West instead .\nThese candidates are putting a lot of priority on the Silver State . The most obvious of these is Sen. Kamala Harris , who is banking on strong showings in Nevada and South Carolina to propel her to a Super Tuesday win in her home state of California \u2014 which has a prize of a whopping 475 delegates . Last week , she was campaigning the Nevada way : marching with striking McDonald \u2019 s workers in Las Vegas for a $ 15 minimum wage .\n\u201c If we want to talk about these golden arches being a symbol of the best of America , well , the arches are falling short , \u201d Harris said during the protest . \u201c We have got to recognize that working people deserve livable wages . \u201d\nThe most recent polling in Nevada shows a mirror of the national race : Biden , Sen. Elizabeth Warren , and Sen. Bernie Sanders lead the state , according to a recent Monmouth University poll .\nThe poll shows Biden with a strong lead among likely Nevada Democratic voters that deem themselves moderate or conservative and a narrow lead among those who call themselves \u201c somewhat \u201d liberal , and Warren and Sanders carrying the percentage of \u201c very \u201d liberal caucus-goers .\nBiden so far is clearly at the front of the pack . But Nevada political experts noted there \u2019 s plenty of room for Warren or another candidate to break through . The 2016 primary contest between Hillary Clinton and Sanders was unexpectedly competitive , in part because Sanders \u2019 s populist message resonated strongly with Nevada \u2019 s working-class voters .\nWarren is now aggressively staking out her territory as the populist candidate . She has had staff on the ground in Nevada since January , and now is up to about 30 full-time staff , per campaign spokesperson Terrence Clark . Warren \u2019 s national strategy \u201c means competing in all 50 states and seven territories \u2014 including Nevada , \u201d Clark told me .\nBiden is also building up his campaign infrastructure in the state , according to a campaign aide .\n\u201c This campaign is taking Nevada very seriously , \u201d the aide said . \u201c It \u2019 s an important early state ; it \u2019 s one of the most diverse states and has an important and engaged African American , Latino , and AAPI [ Asian American or Pacific Islander ] population . The vice president and the campaign plan to engage with all Nevadans , including making inroads to rural Nevada . \u201d\nAs the race in Nevada heats up , all eyes are on Reid , the powerful former Senate majority leader , party boss , and arguably the catalyst for the creation of the caucuses . Reid \u2019 s appointment book these days is filled with 2020 names ; Sen. Amy Klobuchar was waiting patiently outside his office as Reid and I concluded an interview in April . Beto O \u2019 Rourke , in town for a candidate forum on labor that weekend , mentioned he \u2019 d also met with the former Senate leader .\nBut Reid is keeping things close to the vest for now , telling me he won \u2019 t make an endorsement until the caucuses are over . He readily admits he encouraged Warren ( whom he \u201c thinks the world of \u201d ) to run for president , and still considers Biden a \u201c friend . \u201d\n\u201c [ Warren ] knows I can \u2019 t endorse her , I can \u2019 t endorse Joe or anybody else , \u201d Reid said . \u201c But that doesn \u2019 t mean I can \u2019 t tell everybody how good they are . \u201d\nReid \u2019 s endorsement will be key to whoever wins the 2020 nomination . But that person needs to win over the rest of Nevada Democrats first .",
