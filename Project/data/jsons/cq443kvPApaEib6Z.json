'' He also noted that white people understand that slavery was a curse , but added that `` we miss the blessing of slavery , that it actually built up the framework for the world that white people live in . \u201d\nThe comments were made during a discussion with Christian rapper Lecrae and Chick-fil-A CEO Dan Cathy amid a national reckoning over the police killing of George Floyd and racial injustice . By Tuesday , clips from the interview had spread across social media , with many denouncing the remarks as offensive .\nGiglio released a video statement on Twitter in which he apologized for a `` horrible choice of words '' that `` do not reflect my heart at all . ''\n`` I just wanted to come to you directly today and sincerely apologize for the use of the phrase 'white blessing , ' '' he said . `` Most importantly , I extend that apology to my black brothers and sisters .
