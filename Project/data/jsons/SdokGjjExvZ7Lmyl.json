Democrats , meanwhile , pointed to new challenges -- with Hillary Clinton calling ISIS an `` unusually effective threat '' and Bernie Sanders saying climate change remains crucial to national security .\nAs President Barack Obama huddled at an international summit in Turkey with Russia 's Vladimir Putin and other world leaders , several GOP White House contenders faulted him for failing to take the rise of the ISIS more seriously and called on Obama to revisit plans to admit 10,000 Syrian refugees in 2016 .\nSen. Lindsey Graham , R-South Carolina , issued a dire warning , saying that `` there 's another 9/11 coming and it 's coming from Syria . ''\nSen. Graham : The worst is yet to come with ISIS\nSen.

Graham : The worst is yet to come with ISIS\n`` I believe the United States and the world needs to go on offense and stop the reason people have to leave Syria , '' Graham said on CNN 's `` State of the Union . '' `` The good people are leaving because they 're being raped and murdered and some terrorists are trying to get in their ranks . The best thing the world could do for Syrian people is to create a safe haven within Syria , a no-fly zone . ''\nFormer Florida Gov . Jeb Bush called for a `` thorough screening '' of those refugees in an appearance on CNN 's `` State of the Union . ''\n`` I think we need to be obviously very , very cautious , '' Bush said .\nJUST WATCHED Jeb Bush : Call 'Islamic terrorism ' what it is Replay More Videos ...

''\n`` We wo n't be able to take more refugees , '' he said . `` It 's not that we do n't want to , it 's that we ca n't . Because there 's no way to background check someone that 's coming from Syria . Who do you call and do a background check on them ? ''\nFormer Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum agreed , saying that `` under no circumstances '' should the United States take Syrian refugees .\n`` By taking in persecuted Christians , Jews , and moderate Muslims , we are complicit in helping ISIS accomplish their goal of establishing an Islamic caliphate , '' Santorum said in a statement . `` Without Christians , Jews , or moderate Muslims in the region , radical Islam will be allowed to run rampant . ''\nOn `` Fox News Sunday , '' Ben Carson said the West should `` wage a counter-war against them utilizing social media , and all the same mechanisms that they use . '' He also opposed allowing Syrian refugees into the United States .\n`` Bringing people into this country from that area of the world I think is a huge mistake , '' he said . `` Because why would n't they infiltrate them with people who are ideologically opposed to us ? It would be foolish for them not to do that . So , we need to be very compassionate to understand that these people have been displaced and we should use our expertise and resources to help get them resettle over there , and to support them over there , but to bring them here under these circumstances is a suspension of intellect .

We have to be equally so to stand up for our values , to stand up for who we are as a people . Attacking Paris , the city of light , reminds us that there is no middle ground in going after these terrorists . ''\nClinton suggested `` pulling countries off the sidelines so that they work with us and contribute to this ongoing struggle against radical jihadism . ''\nOn CBS ' `` Face the Nation , '' Clinton 's primary rival for the Democratic nomination , Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , said climate change is a major national security threat -- including in the rise of ISIS .\n`` When you have drought , when people ca n't grow their crops , they 're going to migrate into cities , '' Sanders said .\n`` And when people migrate into cities and they do n't have jobs , there 's going to be a lot more instability , a lot more unemployment , and people will be subject to the types of propaganda that al-Qaeda and ISIS are using right now , '' he said . `` So , where you have discontent , where you have instability , that 's where problems lie . And certainly , without a doubt , climate change will lead to that . ''\nLater Sunday , during a speech at Simpson College in Iowa , Sanders called for the United States to work with Russia , Saudi Arabia and Iran in combating ISIS .\n`` We have different points of view ... but Russia has got to join us . We are concerned about Iran , but Iran has to join us .
