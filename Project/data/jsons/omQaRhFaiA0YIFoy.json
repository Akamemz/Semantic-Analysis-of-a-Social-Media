It \u2019 s not fair , damnit ! And it just gets worse and worse as things in America , under Trump , get better and better .\nThis prosperity and this relative peace are the worst things ever . Well , for you liberals . But then that \u2019 s all that matters , according to liberals .\nSo , now you got Bill Maher pining for a recession , apparently so Trump will somehow get tossed out of office to make room for some liberal to come in and \u2026 do what Trump did and bring prosperity , but more wokely ? Then there \u2019 s Nancy Pelosi , fresh from bathing in a tub of 100-dollar bills , complaining that more cash in your pocket is a bad thing because it means she can \u2019 t spend it the way she chooses \u2013 and she chooses to spend it on greedy foreigners , lay-about bums , and other Democrat constituencies .\nNever have so many been so angry about so little bad news . With nothing real to complain about , they have to hype every silly little thing to the point where they are screeching \u201c Nazi ! \u201d at you while you are trying to gnaw on a Quarter Pounder .\nTheir anger is a giveaway . In poker , it \u2019 s called a \u201c tell. \u201d A tell is a little thing a player does that gives away the hand he \u2019 s holding . Liberals \u2019 tell is how they constantly bemoan success , and what their tell tells us is that they are eager to trade our prosperity for their power .\nBut what do they care about our prosperity anyway ? They are actively against our prosperity ! Proud , self-sufficient people don \u2019 t need or want them . The entire business model of the Democratic Party is to keep Democratic constituencies poor and then give them money looted from non-Democratic constituencies . If the Democratic constituencies stop needing handouts , uh oh . What would they need the Dems for anymore ?\nBetter a recession with them in power than prosperity without them in power . Which kind of shows where \u201c Normals \u2019 Happiness \u201d ranks on the Big List of Liberal Priorities \u2013 at the bottom , Priority # 2382 , right there between \u201c Vegan Pronoun Equity \u201d and \u201c Reforming the FBI . \u201d\nSpeaking of the FBI \u2013 well , no one is speaking of the FBI . The leftist media saw to that with a coordinated response of utter outrage against the Trump administration for treating criminals like criminals . Phew , that was close \u2013 we almost had to spend a few days talking about how simultaneously corrupt and inept the Democrats infesting the FBI and the DOJ are .\nStill , if you \u2019 re a liberal , you not only have to have the major sadz because that sad-faced hack Bobbie the Beagle Mueller and his band of Democrat donors have found zero evidence of collusion . You have to be bummed that neither they nor all the lying sacks of Schiff in the deadwood fed bureaucracy can even manage to frame the president .\nThe libs bet the House on a bunch of government nimrods who are , unfortunately for # TheResistance , more incompetent than corrupt , which is saying something . Mueller \u2019 s got nothing , and he \u2019 s not going to get anything . He had Paul Manafort \u2019 s bail revoked , but is Manafort going to roll \u2013 by which I mean give Mueller the perjured testimony feds are used to pressing out of their stoolies ? No . Manfort knows Mueller \u2019 s got nothing , because there is nothing , and he also absolutely knows there \u2019 s no pardon waiting for him if he invents Russia stuff to please Torquemueller . And Trump is totally going to pardon him , and General Mike Flynn too if that gun-to-head plea isn \u2019 t withdrawn in light of all the lies we \u2019 ve seen from Integrity Boy Comey \u2019 s cohorts .\nGood . Because this corrupt practice of strong-arming testimony that is almost certainly false , in whole or part , out of \u201c witnesses \u201d by threatening them and their families with eternity in the slam has got to stop . Pardons would send a message \u2013 no more of this garbage . And then these lazy prosecutors might have to start proving their cases with evidence instead of with witnesses who have to choose between lying and dying in jail .\nLiberals are devastated that Russiagate is a dud , and more so because the collateral damage on liberal institutions brought on by their fake scandal is going to be awesome . As a liberal you can \u2019 t be looking forward to November , not with Maxine Waters \u2019 stupiding it up all over cable . Every Normal in America sympathized with Sarah Sanders , and the vast majority vowed some ballot box payback . These idiots ought to report their social warfare jerkiness as in-kind campaign contributions to Trump \u2019 s mid-term victory campaign .\nOh , there \u2019 s plenty of big talk among Dems and their media Schumer-sniffers about the onrushing blue wave , but where is this wave ? Where is it hiding ? Where is there any indication that the people who elected Trump are going to say \u201c Yeah , I like the tax cuts and the booming economy and beating ISIS and my kid not having to fight street-to-street in Seoul and the crackdown on illegals and the conservative judges and Trump generally not taking of guff from liberals and their media pets , but I \u2019 ve suddenly just realized that Trump can be mean sometimes so I \u2019 ll vote for Democrat guy who wants to help Pelosi take my guns , import MS-13 into my neighborhood , and then pester me at the Arby \u2019 s . \u201d\nJust look how unhappy the libs are .
