On Wednesday night , federal judge Orlando L. Garcia of the Western District of Texas issued a ruling stopping most of the state \u2019 s \u201c anti-sanctuary-city \u201d law SB4 \u2014 which attempted to force local police departments to assist federal immigration enforcement \u2014 from going into effect as scheduled on Friday .\nThe ruling signals that the judge is likely to find that the provisions put on hold are unconstitutional .

But it does prevent the Republican-dominated Texas state legislature from using immigration to punish Texas \u2019 s Democratic-controlled city governments . And it substantially reduces the scope of a law that , all told , would have expanded state enforcement of immigration law more than any other bill since Arizona \u2019 s SB 1070 \u201c show me your papers \u201d law from 2010 .

And if they ask about immigration status , the law doesn \u2019 t allow them to do anything with that information beyond sending it to ICE \u2014 they can \u2019 t hold onto someone they would otherwise let go while they wait to hear back from ICE about the detainee \u2019 s immigration status , for example .\nBut it \u2019 s not entirely clear , in practice , how much those safeguards actually mean .

The parts of the law the plaintiffs were worried about weren \u2019 t the parts that assisted cops who wanted to help enforce federal immigration law , but the parts that punished cops and departments who wanted to limit their cooperation with the feds to protect their relations with immigrant communities .
