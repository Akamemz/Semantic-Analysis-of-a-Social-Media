There are only about five people I 'd consider doing this for , I have heard almost verbatim from hosts at two separate such gatherings in the grim political year of 2017 . Los cincos amigos : Sens . Rand Paul ( R\u2013Ky . ) and Mike Lee ( R\u2013Utah ) ; Reps. Justin Amash ( R\u2013Mich . ) and Thomas Massie ( R\u2013Ky . ) ; and Flake .\nOne week after the fundraiser , Flake made his exit from the world of electoral competition , announcing in an emotional Senate speech that he was no longer seeking re-election in 2018 . `` I will not be complicit , '' the shaky-voiced senator declared . `` We must never meekly accept the daily sundering of our country\u2014the personal attacks , the threats against principles , freedoms , and institutions ; the flagrant disregard for truth or decency , the reckless provocations . '' The headline on his Washington Post op-ed the next day said it all : `` Enough . ''\nIn the moment , Flake 's gesture was hailed as a `` historic '' rebuke to the president ( Mike Barnicle ) , `` the most important speech of 2017 '' ( CNN 's Chris Cillizza ) , and even `` a history lesson for the ages '' ( Forbes ' John Baldoni ) . Then , predictably , a Donald Trump\u2013related bombshell blotted out all competing political stories , when news broke three days later that Special Investigator Robert Mueller would be handing out his first indictments in the Russia probe .\nEven before that , though , the relentless gears of tribal politics had been busy busting apart Flake 's stentorian pretensions and spitting out dismissive bile . `` Jeff Flake was just fine with broken Washington until he could n't win his seat , '' Pete Kasperowicz scoffed in the Washington Examiner . `` Jeff Flake is not a hero , despite what he wants you to think , '' ThinkProgress cautioned its lefty readers .\nThe critics had some valid points . Flake , like Sen. Bob Corker ( R\u2013Tenn . ) before him , only turned away from politics in disgust when faced with a stiff challenge in his own primary . ( And in increasingly competitive Arizona , the Democrats are putting up a strong Senate candidate in Rep. Kyrsten Sinema . ) Flake also declared in his Post piece that `` We can no longer remain silent , merely observing this train wreck , passively , as if waiting for someone else to do something '' \u2014but what is shying away from a political contest if not passive ?\nAnd though the former Goldwater Institute executive director may be libertarian by Capitol Hill standards , he still has taken a number of questionable votes . Flake moved to confirm as attorney general Jeff Sessions and , before that , Loretta Lynch . Both are abysmal on civil asset forfeiture , a form of government theft the senator has long decried . He voted in favor of the authorization for use of military force in Iraq , though he later turned against the war . He advocated missile strikes on Syria in September 2013 and again when President Trump lobbed some in April 2017 .\nBut Flake also embodies the best and arguably most endangered tenets of modern Republicanism . `` It is clear at this moment that a traditional conservative who believes in limited government and free markets , who is devoted to free trade , and who is pro-immigration , has a narrower and narrower path to nomination in the Republican Party , '' he said on the Senate floor , accurately . `` It is also clear to me for the moment we have given in or given up on those core principles in favor of the more viscerally satisfying anger and resentment . To be clear , the anger and resentment that the people feel at the royal mess we have created are justified . But anger and resentment are not a governing philosophy .

In comportment he is a bipartisan dealmaker , not an us-vs.-them bombthrower , the most famous sign of which was his work on the `` Gang of Eight '' immigration reform effort that passed the Senate in 2013 but stalled out in the House .\nFlake believes that long-term fiscal reform , including entitlements , must be done in such a way that both parties have skin in the game . `` I was in Congress between 2000 and 2006 when we had Republicans controlling both chambers and the White House , '' he told Reason in 2016 . `` I can tell you that whenever entitlement spending or Social Security reform came up , you 'd hear , 'We 've got a midterm election just around the corner , we 're not going to take that risk .
