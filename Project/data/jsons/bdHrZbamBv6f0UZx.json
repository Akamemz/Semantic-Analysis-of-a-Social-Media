Mark Pryor in this heavy-spending slugfest.\n\nCotton, an Army veteran, was stiff on the stump but has gotten better. He\u2019s a trained Harvard lawyer, and his challenge now is to prosecute a closing argument that Pryor is personally likable but has changed since going to Washington 12 years ago.

Mary Landrieu just replaced her campaign manager in an October shakeup, and polls show she will not get to 50 percent in the November primary, setting up a likely December runoff against GOP Rep. Bill Cassidy.\n\n( POLITICO\u2019s 2014 race ratings)\n\nThe two are very different politicians: Cassidy is somewhat bland and has kept a low profile in the race; Landrieu is an expert retail politician whose campaign circulated a video last week of her doing the Wobble dance \u2014 a performance that came weeks after she won glowing press for helping a college student do a keg stand at a tailgate party.

If the race has fewer national implications, it could become a popularity contest, giving Landrieu a better shot.\n\n4) Alaska \u2014 Will the Natives vote?\n\nOne of the greatest X-factors in the battle for the Senate has been the lack of credible, nonpartisan polling in the Last Frontier. There have been plenty of internal surveys, but it\u2019s difficult to poll because of the small, sparse, spread-out population.\n\nThis past week brought the first two live-caller surveys, and both were good for Republican Dan Sullivan: He led freshman Sen. Mark Begich by 6 points in a CNN/ORC poll and by 4 points in a Fox News survey. The base has coalesced behind Sullivan since he won the August primary.\n\n( DRIVING THE DAY: Last minute 2014 spending)\n\nBegich focuses many of his ads on wooing crossover Republicans, but he\u2019s also invested heavily in expanding the electorate, registering Native populations in far-flung areas that have not been reached before and who depend on federal largesse. Even Republicans are blown away by the size of his field program.\n\nBegich\u2019s best hope is that his team can actually get Natives not reached by pollsters to vote. It\u2019s a key test of the DSCC\u2019s $60 million get-out-the-vote program in competitive states.\n\n5) Iowa \u2014 Can Democrats turn the race into a referendum on Joni Ernst?\n\nA Des Moines Register poll published over the weekend shows that Republican Joni Ernst\u2019s lead has narrowed to just 1 point, down from 6 points in its last survey. She raised an eye-popping $6 million in the third quarter and has seemed to have momentum on her side in the race to succeed the retiring liberal Tom Harkin.\n\nThe ads are overwhelmingly about her. Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley and his allies have used a series of clips from the GOP primary to portray Ernst as \u201ctoo extreme\u201d on everything from abortion to education and entitlements. Ernst underperformed in their second debate Saturday night, finding herself on the defensive about her ties to the Koch brothers and support for eliminating the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nDemocrats believe Braley can pull it out if he makes the final three weeks of the race all about Ernst\u2019s views.
