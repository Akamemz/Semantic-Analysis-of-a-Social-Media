The federal government picks up 100 percent of the expansion \u2019 s cost in 2014-2016 , before scaling back its contribution to 90 percent in 2020 and beyond .\nBut the Supreme Court made expansion optional , so only 28 states and the District of Columbia have augmented their programs .\n\u201c We \u2019 re just seeing some stubbornness that \u2019 s really based on ideology , not on wise public health policy , that is preventing most people in most states from getting the Medicaid that would save the state money in the long term , \u201d Mr. Obama told ABC .\nThe overall health law remains a key target for the Republican-majority Congress , which is hoping to leverage a budget tool known as \u201c reconciliation \u201d to pass a filibuster-proof repeal bill , forcing Mr. Obama to veto their will .\nAlso , the Supreme Court will rule by June whether the administration is unlawfully paying out exchange subsidies to at least 34 states that rely on the federal HealthCare.gov portal .
