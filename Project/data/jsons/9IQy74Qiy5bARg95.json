( Aaron Josefczyk/Reuters )\nIn the decade that has passed since the financial crisis , we haven \u2019 t learned anything .\nGeneral Motors just shared some very bad news : It is closing five factories in the United States and Canada , eliminating 15 percent of its work force ( and 25 percent of its executives ) , and getting out of the passenger-car business almost entirely to focus on SUVs and trucks . President Donald Trump threw a fit , but GM shrugged him off . The facts are the facts .\nWhat did U.S. taxpayers get for their $ 11.2 billion bailout of GM ? About ten years of business-as-usual , and one very expensive lesson .\nNever mind the moral hazard , the rent-seeking , the cronyism and the favoritism , and all of the inevitable corruption that inevitably accompanies multibillion-dollar sweetheart deals between Big Business and Big Government . Set aside the ethical questions entirely and focus on the mechanics : Businesses such as GM get into trouble not because of one-time events in the wider economic environment , but because they are so weak as businesses that they can not weather one-time events in the wider economic environment . GM \u2019 s sedan business is weak because GM \u2019 s sedans are weak : Virtually all of the best-selling sedans in the United States are made by Toyota , Honda , and Nissan . The lower and middle sections of the market are dominated by Asia , and the high end of the market by Europe : Mercedes , Audi , BMW . GM can \u2019 t compete with the Honda Civic at its price point or with the Audi A7 at its price point . Consumers like what they like , and they aren \u2019 t buying what GM is selling . It isn \u2019 t winning in the dino-juice-powered market , in the electric-car market , or in the hybrid market , either : GM is not exactly what you would call a nimble corporation .\nOn the car front , anyway . GM has a much healthier business selling trucks and SUVs , a business that it now will focus its resources on \u2014 as it should have done long ago . Why didn \u2019 t it do that ?\nIn part , because we \u2014 you and me , suckers \u2014 paid them not to . We were told that we simply must bail out General Motors during the financial crisis because if we failed to , that would lead to a bloodbath of job losses and cascading business failures . But the job losses were always going to come : Paying people to build things that consumers don \u2019 t really want isn \u2019 t a sustainable business model . That \u2019 s a reality you can not bail your way out of .\nThe U.S. government was buffaloed into the bailouts . The so-called experts argued that if GM went down , it was going to take the whole U.S. automobile industry with it , that its failure would do such violence to the supply chain and automotive ecosystem that it had to be prevented at practically any cost . That alone should have been reason enough to liquidate GM rather than reorganize in bankruptcy what we were just informed is a systemic threat to the stability of the U.S. economy .\nBut the U.S. automobile industry was never going to fail in toto . The unprofitable parts were . There are billions and billions of dollars to be made selling Americans pickup trucks and SUVs , and GM knows how to do that . And if GM doesn \u2019 t do it , somebody else will . We \u2019 ve already seen that as U.S. automakers wind down their passenger-car businesses : Soon , you won \u2019 t be able to buy a Ford sedan in the United States , but you can do yourself a favor and buy a Toyota Camry , instead . \u201c But what about our jobs ? \u201d the so-called nationalists demand . The Toyota Camry is made in Kentucky , which , last time I checked , was still in the Union .\nThe same thing holds true , broadly , of the banks we bailed out . The \u201c Too Big To Fail \u201d institutions are bigger than ever as regulatory pressure and ordinary competition encourage consolidation in the financial-services sector . Does anybody really think that the practice of lending money for interest \u2014 a business model old enough to have a Biblical injunction against it \u2014 was going to stop if we let a half-dozen banks reap what they sowed ? Of course there would have been disruption . Here \u2019 s a safe bet : There \u2019 s going to be disruption , still , because \u2014 focus on this , now \u2014 we didn \u2019 t solve the problem . Bailouts don \u2019 t solve problems . Bailouts at best delay the day of reckoning .\nSubsidies eventually run dry . Surely this has occurred to Jeff Bezos and his team at Amazon . If New York City and Washington only made sense as new corporate homes because of a few billion dollars in subsidies ( amounting to something like 2 percent of Jeff Bezos \u2019 s personal net worth ) , then it would be the height of stupidity to build permanent facilities there in return for a one-time offer of largely fixed benefits . Of course , Bezos et al . are not above picking up free money if it \u2019 s just lying around . Maybe they should be : If the world \u2019 s richest man can \u2019 t afford to exercise some leadership , then who can ?\nOr consider that subsidy from the point of view of Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio , the Tweedle-Dum and Tweedle-Evil of New York politics . If New York City can only hope to attract a firm like Amazon by essentially bribing ( in an entirely legal fashion ! ) its shareholders , then what does that say about New York City ? A New York City with excellent schools , a first-rate mass-transit system , a sensible tax and regulatory environment , and better public sanitation might not have to pay off corporate shareholders \u2014 no , that kind of New York City would have the confidence to say : \u201c This is New York . Lots of people want to be here . You \u2019 re welcome to join us , and we \u2019 ll provide the best municipal services we can , but don \u2019 t act like you \u2019 re doing us a favor . We were a big deal before you came along , guys. \u201d But fixing the schools and subways is hard work , and doing it economically is even harder . You know what isn \u2019 t hard work ? Giving somebody else \u2019 s money to a third party from whom you want something . That isn \u2019 t leadership . It \u2019 s cowardice and sloth .\nBig Business and Big Government have a lot in common : the challenge of trying to manage complexity through bureaucracy , the deadening mentality and corporate culture of the Organization Man , inertia , internal politics , the agent-principal problem . Sometimes , they deal with those problems in remarkably similar fashion : by convincing us that they are so big and so important that we can not manage without them . But it is not so .

Elon Musk , even in the middle of what seems to be a very weird and very public episode of some kind , is standing by to sell you what is arguably the best American car ever made , and a million Uber and Lyft drivers are helping many urbanites see that they don \u2019 t really need a car at all .\nThere was moneylending before J. P. Morgan , and there will be moneylending after JPMorgan Chase & Co. And here \u2019 s a little something you may not know : \u201c Too Big To Fail \u201d isn \u2019 t a problem that crept up on us in 2008 \u2014 the Wall Street Journal was writing about the issue as early as 1983 , identifying eleven large financial institutions that the federal government would not allow to fail .\nWhy didn \u2019 t we do anything ? Nobody wants to rock the boat during the good times , and during the bad times politicians become so fearful of job loss that they will abandon principle and intelligence both ( some are less burdened by these than others ) to prevent that from happening or to stanch it when it already is under way .\nIn the short term , that may be good politics . In the long term , it \u2019 s bad policy .\nJobs aren \u2019 t an end \u2014 jobs are a means , the way we get cars made and chickens plucked and code written .
