Liberation from Bureaucracy. DeVos\u2019 educational philosophy could enable her to liberate American education from encroachment by federal bureaucracy. Under the Obama administration, the federal government functioned as a giant octopus, bypassing families, communities, and states in order to reach its tentacles into school curriculum, teacher evaluation, values conformity, and even restroom policies. DeVos signals a departure from that era. Her stated educational philosophy suggests that she will not turn Democratic encroachment into Republican encroachment; instead, she will reduce federal encroachment in order to empower families, local communities, and states.\n\n2. Freedom of Thought\n\nMuch ado has been made about Secretary DeVos\u2019 Dutch Calvinism. But that\u2019s misguided.\n\nDutch Calvinism is a rich religious tradition that emphasizes the rights and freedoms of families, communities, and religions. For that reason, it finds adherents on the right and on the left.\n\nAdditionally, it places an especially high value on education, but emphasizes that a pluralistic society should be tolerant enough to allow diverse families and communities to build their own educational institutions and choose which institution(s) their children can attend. Unfortunately, many liberal educators are quite illiberal, unwilling to tolerate any type of educational diversity that undermines the federal government\u2019s impulse toward command-and-control.\n\n3. Empowerment for the Financially-Disadvantaged\n\nDeVos\u2019 educational philosophy would allow financially-disadvantaged children to choose the education that fits their unique needs and abilities. In the current system, the government taxes citizens in order to provide education, but then dictates and determines how the tax money can be used. The message is clear: the federal government\u2014rather than the family or local community\u2014is responsible for shaping the way a child understands and interprets the world.\n\nUnder DeVos\u2019 potential system of vouchers and charters, however, citizens will be able to exercise more influence over their own child\u2019s education. They will also be able to send their children to a wider variety of schools, including those that would have been financially prohibitive without the vouchers. This sort of system is supported by prominent intellectuals and educators such as Anthony Bradley and has been supported in the past by Democratic politicians such as Cory Booker.\n\n4. Facilitation by a Philanthropist\n\nDeVos\u2019 critics argued that she wasn\u2019t qualified to serve as our new Secretary of Education because she had not served as a teacher, a principal, or an educational policy wonk. Yet, those experiences are not necessary prerequisites for the office. As Michael Petrilli noted, Secretary DeVos has devoted her life energies and financial resources to the cause of education and has interacted extensively with politicians and educational policy makers. Although her path to the post of secretary is different than her predecessors, it is a good path and one that qualifies her.\n\nHope for our Children\u2019s Education\n\nWe already know that DeVos will be an imperfect Secretary of Education -- just as all prior secretaries of education have been. Yet, there are good reasons to believe that she will be successful.\n\nShe is a philanthropist who has proven that she cares deeply about education. She holds a philosophy of education that can reduce bureaucracy, increase free thinking, and empower the financially disadvantaged. And, she has the work ethic and the connections to make it happen.\n\nSo let\u2019s just step back for a moment, cool our fevered brows, and pull for Betsy DeVos as she tries to reform our nations\u2019 education system.",
