The cost : on average less than a penny a gallon .\nNot so , says the oil industry , which has been battling the EPA over the proposed rules . The new rules will add as much as nine cents a gallon to the cost of making fuel and will produce \u201c ambiguous \u201d results , says The American Petroleum Institute . API , the industry \u2019 s lobbying arm in Washington , refers to the proposed new rules as part of a \u201c tsunami of regulations \u201d the industry faces this year that could add as much as 65 cents to the cost of producing a gallon of fuel in the future .\nGasoline prices are politically sensitive . Consumers often know how much they have paid for a gallon of gasoline compared with their prior fill-up . When pump prices are rising , consumers grumble and , if prices get high enough , cut back on other discretionary purchases . As a result , economists refer to rising fuel prices as a tax on the economy .\nBut will Americans pay more for fuel and smile about it if they believe it will result in cleaner air ?\n\u201c Some will , but the majority won \u2019 t , \u201d answers Tom Kloza , chief oil analyst at GasBuddy.com . \u201c There is a sense among a lot of people that we are entitled to cheaper fuel prices than the rest of the world . \u201d\nThe proposed changes would make US standards the same as those in most of Europe , Japan , and South Korea , Mr. Kloza says . \u201c We would be joining 45 other countries with tougher fuel standards , \u201d he says .\nRepublicans quickly attacked the proposed regulation . \u201c The Obama Administration is modeling our regulations after California , which has the worst economy in the nation , and today \u2019 s announcement is essentially a guaranteed energy tax hike and unfortunately is just one of many radical policies coming out of this Administration that will deal a heavy blow to middle-class families and small businesses , \u201d said Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana , chairman of the Republican Study Committee , in a statement .\nIn January , Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research , often associated with Democratic issues , conducted what it termed a \u201c bipartisan survey \u201d of 800 registered voters for the American Lung Association on whether Americans favored tougher fuel regulations and improved antipollution laws . It found 62 percent of voters supported new gasoline and vehicle standards , and 32 percent opposed them .\nIf the new rules are implemented as proposed , the EPA says , the new standards would cut smog-producing chemicals by 80 percent , cut down on particulate matter by 70 percent , and reduce vapor emissions to near zero .\nIn the case of sulfur , one culprit in producing smog , the new standard would cut the emission to 10 parts per million in 2017 compared with the current standard of 30 parts per million .
