    "content": "After sidestepping the issue for weeks , President Obama on Thursday apologized to Americans who are losing their health insurance despite his repeated and emphatic promises that it wouldn \u2019 t happen .\nThe president made the admission on a day when Senate Republicans demanded that he fire his top health official in response to \u201c undeniable \u201d problems with Obamacare \u2019 s rollout and his White House fends off doubts that it can fix a balky website that is spoiling the health care law \u2019 s debut .\n\u201c I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me , \u201d the president told NBC in an interview recorded at the White House on Thursday afternoon . \u201c We \u2019 ve got to work hard to make sure that they know we hear them and we \u2019 re going to do everything we can to deal with folks who find themselves in a tough position as a consequence of this . \u201d\nMr. Obama \u2019 s comments represent something of an about-face for the administration , which until now had argued that Americans were aware all along \u2014 or should have been aware \u2014 that Obamacare would result in many people losing policies because they don \u2019 t comply with the law \u2019 s standards .\nAbout 5 percent of Americans \u2014 14 million people \u2014 have plans through the individual insurance market . As many as two-thirds of them could lose coverage because it does not comply with the president \u2019 s signature health care law . The situation has led to a backlash on Capitol Hill , with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle backing bills that would allow consumers to keep their coverage no matter what .\nSome senators went further Thursday . Sen. Pat Roberts , Kansas Republican , and nine other lawmakers signed a letter that calls for Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to lose her job over problems with the Affordable Care Act .\nSEE ALSO : Fire her ! Ten Republican senators press Obama to boot Sebelius\n\u201c Regrettably , these problems were diagnosed early and ignored , \u201d the senators wrote , citing inspector general reports from this year .\nCompounding the turmoil , a bipartisan pair of senators followed through on a proposal to postpone the law \u2019 s individual mandate for one year in light of the roadblocks to coverage .\nThe mandate , which requires most Americans to have health insurance next year , was placed in the law to ensure that young , healthy consumers keep premiums in check when those with pre-existing conditions enroll because they no longer can be denied coverage .\n\u201c Since the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010 , there have been many identifiable problems exposed in the law that need to be addressed , \u201d Sen. Joe Manchin III , West Virginia Democrat , said in filing the bill with Sen. Mark Kirk , Illinois Republican .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve worked through a few of these issues , but our job in Congress is far from over . We need to start working together to fix this law and make it work so that all Americans have access to affordable and reliable health care coverage , \u201d the two men said .\nThe rising discontent on Capitol Hill and Mr. Obama \u2019 s apology capped a week when the president was massaging earlier statements by adding an \u201c if \u201d to his promise , offered more than 30 times over the past several years , that \u201c if you like your plan , you can keep your plan . \u201d\n\u201c If you had one of these plans before the Affordable Care Act came into law and you really liked that plan , what we said was , \u2018 You can keep it if it hasn \u2019 t changed since the law passed , \u2019 \u201d Mr. Obama said earlier in the week .\nNo previous public statements contained the caveat that plans must remain unchanged , but they often were spiked with such emphatics as \u201c period \u201d and \u201c no matter what. \u201d The Politifact fact-checking journalism site gave Mr. Obama \u2019 s statements a \u201c Pants on Fire \u201d rating .\nSenate Democrats , several of whom face tough re-election battles next year in Republican-leaning states , are increasingly nervous about the rocky rollout of the law . The Affordable Care Act essentially belongs to their party because they passed it with no Republican votes in Congress , cheered it on for three years and helped precipitate a partial government shutdown last month by refusing Republican demands for a delay .\nSo far , none of them has called for Mrs. Sebelius to lose her job over the situation . Republicans have not been so shy .\nMr. Roberts \u2014 who knows Mrs. Sebelius personally from their shared home state of Kansas \u2014 and co-signers of his letter outlined a litany of problems with HealthCare.gov , a website that was supposed to connect residents of 36 states with health plans on the individual market but has frequently crashed since its Oct. 1 debut .\nThe online portal has struggled to transmit accurate reports to insurers , and doubts about the site \u2019 s technical safeguards have persisted despite the Obama administration \u2019 s pledge that the system is secure .\nMr. Obama has offered no indication he will oust Mrs. Sebelius . Instead , the administration says it is focused on making HealthCare.gov work for the \u201c vast majority \u201d of users by the end of the month .\nMrs. Sebelius , who said she is accountable for Obamacare \u2019 s rollout failures but refused to resign , will travel to Atlanta on Friday to promote Obamacare and meet with in-person assistants who are helping people enroll in health coverage . Her trip follows Mr. Obama \u2019 s jaunt to Texas on Wednesday to urge reluctant state officials to expand Medicaid enrollment to people making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level .\nMrs. Sebelius is coming off a pair of bruising hearings on Capitol Hill , where she doubled down on the importance of the health care law for sick Americans who may gain insurance for the first time .\nBut Republican lawmakers say the reforms are fundamentally flawed . Millions of Americans are losing health care plans that do not meet minimum-coverage standards under Obamacare , and they can not explore alternatives if the online portals are not working .\nThese customers might be able to find better coverage at a better price under Obamacare \u2019 s exchanges , which offer income-based subsidies to defray premium costs , but they would have to sign up by Dec. 15 to have coverage before next year .\n\u201c These people could be left without any insurance at all if the exchange systems are not working soon , \u201d Mr. Roberts and fellow lawmakers wrote .\nJulie Bataille , spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid , said Thursday she thinks the website will run well enough by late this month to give consumers enough time to enroll . She also downplayed talk of extending Obamacare \u2019 s six-month enrollment period past March 31 .\n\u201c That is certainly a long window of time for individuals to get information , get educated and make their plan selection by the end of March , \u201d she told reporters on a conference call .\nCMS has until the end of business Friday to respond to a subpoena from House Ways and Means Committee Republicans that demands figures on how many people have enrolled so far under Obamacare , but the administration has said repeatedly that it will not release the data until \u201c mid-November . \u201d\nA committee spokeswoman said Chairman Dave Camp , Michigan Republican , had not received anything as of Thursday afternoon .\nWhite House spokesman Jay Carney said the subpoena appeared to be a political ploy designed to twist the knife over dismal enrollment .\n\u201c If the purpose is to point out , which I \u2019 m sure it is , that enrollment numbers will be low for October \u2014 take it from me , they \u2019 ll be low in October , \u201d he said .",
