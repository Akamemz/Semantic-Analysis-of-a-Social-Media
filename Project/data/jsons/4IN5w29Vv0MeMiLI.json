The president is doing things that many assumed could not , or would not , be done . He seems to believe , among other things , that he has total control over the federal law enforcement apparatus , that he has the right to pardon himself , that he can not obstruct justice , and that he can not be subpoenaed or indicted for any crimes he might commit .\nAs has been stated by numerous legal scholars , I have the absolute right to PARDON myself , but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong ? In the meantime , the never ending Witch Hunt , led by 13 very Angry and Conflicted Democrats ( & others ) continues into the mid-terms ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) June 4 , 2018\nSome of this has since been contradicted by White House press secretary Sarah Sanders , who dismissed questions about the president pardoning himself . \u201c Thankfully , the president hasn \u2019 t done anything wrong and wouldn \u2019 t have any need for a pardon , \u201d she said at a press briefing in June , adding that \u201c no one is above the law . \u201d\nBut let \u2019 s take the words of the president seriously . If he \u2019 s right \u2014 if he has absolute power to pardon himself from legal consequences for absolutely any wrongdoing \u2014 then we do not have a president ; we have a monarch . And we are not , as John Adams once promised , \u201c a government of laws , not of men . \u201d\nThat might sound dramatic , but I don \u2019 t think it is . Consider the 20-page memo Trump \u2019 s lawyers sent to Robert Mueller \u2019 s team last summer . The document lays out a view of presidential power that is essentially boundless . It states that the president \u201c could , if he wished , terminate \u201d Mueller \u2019 s inquiry \u201c or even exercise his power to pardon if he so desired. \u201d Later , Trump \u2019 s lawyers clarified that the president can fire the FBI director \u201c at any time and for any reason , \u201d including to shut down an inconvenient investigation .\nOr take Trump \u2019 s demand in May that the Justice Department investigate whether the FBI \u201c infiltrated or surveilled \u201d his campaign . The request was both unprecedented and preposterous , but it was not , as far as I can tell , illegal , even if the aim was to undercut an investigation into the president \u2019 s own campaign .\nOne of the many revelations in the past couple of years is that much of what we take for granted in our political system is the product of informal norms and not fixed laws . Baked into our politics is the quiet assumption that the elected leader of the country will be constrained by a sense of decency and a respect for basic liberal democratic customs , and that competition among the three branches of government will protect against deviant actors .\nBut what if partisanship renders Congress dysfunctional ? What if the president doesn \u2019 t care about norms or customs ? And what if the citizenry is so divided or cocooned or alienated that it can \u2019 t reliably pressure Congress to check an overreaching executive ?\nThese are not new questions . When the country was founded , there were vigorous debates between supporters and opponents of the proposed Constitution . In papers , documents , and pamphlets , skeptics , known as Antifederalists , openly worried that a constitutional republic would leave us vulnerable to tyranny , and that human nature was too corruptible to trust with so much power . Now is a fine time to revisit their concerns .\nOver the past year or so , I \u2019 ve spoken to dozens of law professors , former federal prosecutors , and other legal experts . I \u2019 ve asked them if the president can legally obstruct justice , if there are limits to the president \u2019 s pardon power , and if our constitutional system is capable of restraining presidential tyranny .\nNearly everyone agrees that the Constitution forbids the president from operating outside the law , at least in theory . But the question before us is rooted in the complexities of practice , not the ideals of theory : Can our system , such as it is , bind a president who is determined to abuse his or her power ?\nThat \u2019 s what President Trump reportedly said to FBI Director James Comey shortly before he fired him on May 9 , 2017 . Initially , Trump claimed that he fired Comey over his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton \u2019 s emails . He later admitted in an interview with NBC \u2019 s Lester Holt that it was about the Russia investigation .\nDid he obstruct justice ? Probably . But what does it even mean to say the president obstructed justice ?\nObstruction of justice is defined as an attempt to impede or undermine a criminal investigation . The word \u201c attempt \u201d is crucial there . \u201c It requires proof that the person corruptly or by threat influences , impedes , or endeavors to influence or impede the due administration of justice , \u201d Joshua Dressler , a law professor at Ohio State University , told me . \u201c It doesn \u2019 t require proof that justice was obstructed \u2014 only that the person endeavored to influence or impede justice . \u201d\nIn other words , one needn \u2019 t succeed at obstructing justice to be guilty of it . It \u2019 s enough to prove that someone deliberately sought to hinder an investigation . The problem is that intent is often difficult to prove , especially in a circumstance where there are multiple contradictory motives .\nIn this specific case , the powers invested in the presidency complicate matters . \u201c The president is the head of law enforcement in this country , \u201d Eric Posner , a law professor at the University of Chicago , told me , \u201c and if the president is the head of law enforcement , then he has the authority to hire and fire and to tell his subordinates not to pursue certain investigations . \u201d\nThis is the same argument that John Dowd , who previously served as Trump \u2019 s outside lawyer , made to Axios \u2019 s Mike Allen in December . \u201c The president can not obstruct justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer [ under the Constitution \u2019 s Article II ] and has every right to express his view of any case . \u201d\nBut there are compelling counterarguments to this . Jimmy Gurul\u00e9 , who served as assistant attorney general for George H.W . Bush , insists that the constitutional right to hire and fire is not absolute . \u201c There \u2019 s no constitutional right to hire and fire that is without exception , \u201d he told me .\nGurul\u00e9 sees at least three instances in which the president arguably violated obstruction of justice laws . The first is the actual firing of Comey . \u201c If it \u2019 s clear that this was done with the aim of interfering with the investigation , that \u2019 s obstruction of justice . \u201d\nThe second instance has to do with Trump \u2019 s conversations with Comey . \u201c We know that the president asked Sessions and others to leave the room so that he could talk privately with Comey , \u201d Gurul\u00e9 said . \u201c If the president urged Comey to back off [ Michael ] Flynn , or even if he expressed his desire to see Flynn left alone , that strikes me as endeavoring to influence or obstruct the due administration of justice . \u201d\nThe third potential instance of obstruction is Trump \u2019 s alleged conversation with Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats . According to the Washington Post , Trump asked Coats in March 2017 \u201c if he could intervene with then-FBI Director James B. Comey to get the bureau to back off its focus on former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn in its Russia probe. \u201d As with the Comey interactions , the whiff of obstructionism is strong here .\nThese are all discrete cases , Gurul\u00e9 says , and they shouldn \u2019 t be conflated . Even if there \u2019 s a sound justification for Comey \u2019 s firing , \u201c that doesn \u2019 t pertain at all to the conversation between Trump and Comey or between Trump and Coats . \u201d\nWhere one lands on this question has a lot to with how one views the presidency . Yes , the president has the power to hire and fire whomever he likes , but , as former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti explained to me , \u201c just because the president has the power to do something doesn \u2019 t necessarily mean it \u2019 s lawful for him to do so. \u201d For instance , the president can \u2019 t hire someone in exchange for a bribe , or fire someone due to their race or religion .\nThere \u2019 s also what \u2019 s called the \u201c take care clause \u201d of the Constitution ( more on this below ) , which demands that the president \u201c faithfully \u201d execute the laws of the nation . And no serious person would argue that the president is acting in \u201c good faith \u201d when he fires the FBI director to stunt an investigation into his own campaign .\nBut let \u2019 s assume , for a moment , that it could be proven , beyond a shadow of a doubt , that Trump sought to obstruct justice when he fired James Comey . Then what ? If you listen to pundits and prognosticators closely , you \u2019 ll notice the stakes of this debate are often left undefined . Implicitly , commentators talk as if proving obstruction of justice would cause ... something ... to happen .\nHere \u2019 s the scary thing : It \u2019 s not at all clear that that \u2019 s true . Applying the law to the president poses some extraordinary challenges , and no one , at least right now , has a plan to surmount them .\n\u201c Baked into our politics is the quiet assumption that the elected leader of the country will be constrained by a sense of decency and a respect for basic liberal democratic customs \u201d\nImagine that the Mueller probe concludes and it \u2019 s even worse than we suspected . Imagine that Russia meddled in our election and that members of the Trump campaign were knowingly complicit in that effort . Imagine further that the president is shown to have covered this up and obstructed the investigation meant to expose the truth . If all that came to pass , Trump could , as he himself has said , pardon himself and everyone else involved . What then ?\nThe Constitution doesn \u2018 t impose limitations on the president \u2019 s right to pardon , except \u201c in cases of impeachment. \u201d But the issue of presidential self-pardons remains an area of genuine uncertainty , mostly because no president has even broached the possibility before .\nThe framers of the Constitution thought long and hard about the risks of imbuing the president with unlimited pardon power . Alexander Hamilton laid out his logic in one of the more famous Federalist Papers . Hamilton believed \u201c humanity and good policy \u201d dictated that the pardon should remain in the hands of the president , as opposed to Congress .\nBut here \u2019 s the problem : He assumed that future presidents would be constrained by a \u201c sense of responsibility \u201d and would exercise such awesome power with \u201c scrupulousness and caution. \u201d The \u201c dread of being accused of weakness or connivance , \u201d he insisted , would \u201c beget equal circumspection . \u201d\nFrom our post-Trump perch , Hamilton \u2019 s optimism appears misplaced . The current president is not burdened by a \u201c sense of responsibility \u201d and shows no signs of exercising \u201c scrupulousness and caution. \u201d So where does that leave us ?\nAlthough the Constitution doesn \u2019 t settle the question , some legal scholars believe an opinion issued from the Office of Legal Counsel in 1974 , in response to Richard Nixon \u2019 s Watergate scandal , offers some guidance . \u201c Under the fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case , \u201d the document reads , \u201c it would seem that the president can not pardon himself . \u201d\nDiane Marie Amann , a law professor at the University of Georgia , told me that this ought to \u201c put an end to the current discussion. \u201d But Jessica Levinson , who teaches law at Loyola Law School , believes this is hardly a definitive ruling and \u201c not a conclusion you want to take to the proverbial bank . \u201d\nIf we want a more solid footing , we \u2019 ll have to look to the Constitution , since that is where the pardon power comes from . The most interesting argument I \u2019 ve heard thus far was from Jed Shugerman and Ethan Leib , both law professors at Fordham University . They claim that the Constitution prohibits the president from pardoning for the purpose of self-protection , for the same reason it forbids using the pardon power for the purpose of financial gain .\nTheir argument is based on a line in the Constitution known as the \u201c take care clause , \u201d which obligates the president to \u201c take care that the laws be faithfully executed. \u201d The clause , Shugerman and Leib argue , mandates that the president act in such a way as to advance the public interest and not the president \u2019 s private interests .\nHere \u2019 s how Shugerman explained it to me in a separate interview :\nThis language comes directly from fiduciary documents from the 17th and 18th centuries . Fiduciary duties still come up today in the context of corporate boards , trusts , wills , and other legal documents that impose obligations on people to act in the best interests of the people they \u2019 re serving . A fiduciary duty means you can \u2019 t serve your own personal interests over the interests of your client or company or , in the case of the president , your country .\nIn the same way a lawyer or a CEO must act in the best interests of her client or company , a president is compelled by the Constitution to execute the laws in such a way as to protect the best interests of the people . By that logic , a presidential self-pardon would be unconstitutional and therefore illegal .\nThis is a plausible reading of the Constitution , but , as Shugerman admits , it \u2019 s never been tested in court and he has no idea if it would hold . ( Other legal experts I spoke to told me that Shugerman is right but they doubt the argument would sway a court . )\nBut even if a slew of presidential pardons could be shown to be illegal , who would enforce that judgment ? Unlike for an average citizen who breaks the law , justice in this case is not swift and sure \u2014 the police do not march into the Oval Office . The remedies , rather , are political , and thus uncertain .\nBetween 1787 and 1788 , a public debate raged between the so-called Federalists and Antifederalists about whether to ratify the Constitution . The Federalists , led by James Madison , John Jay , and Alexander Hamilton , argued in defense of the Constitution , and the Antifederalists , whose authors remained anonymous , argued against it .\nWhen I first read these papers , I remember how badly I wanted the Federalists to be right . And yet as I read along , I kept nodding in agreement to the Antifederalist arguments . I still think the Federalists got more things right than wrong , but I keep returning to the Antifederalists and their deep skepticism about our capacity to restrain a tyrannical executive .\nThe Federalists were pessimistic about human nature , but , as the Hamilton quotes above suggest , they had something of a blind spot for the presidency . True , they established checks and balances , but they placed an immense amount of power in the executive . The Antifederalists never tired of pointing this out , and their arguments will strike the contemporary reader as depressingly relevant . Here \u2019 s a typical passage from Antifederalist No . 67 :\nHis power of nomination , garrisoned by troops at his direction , unrestrained power of granting pardons for treason , which may be used to screen from punishment those whom he had secretly instigated to commit the crime , and thereby prevent discovery of his own guilt ; his duration in office for four years \u2014 these and various other principles evidently prove the truth of the position \u2014 that if the president is possessed of ambition , he has power and time sufficient to ruin his country .\nWe may have , for the first president , and perhaps , one in a century or two afterwards ( if the government should withstand the attacks of others ) a great and good man , governed by superior motives ; but these are not events to be calculated upon in the present state of human nature .\nSo the concern , even back then , was that the extraordinary powers invested in the presidency left the country vulnerable to a demagogue or crook , someone capable of exploiting the office without any regard for the health of the republic . But the Antifederalists weren \u2019 t merely worried about corruption ; they also questioned whether we could sustain the kind of culture that would support a robust constitutional system .\nThe American founders were attuned to these concerns , and they built failsafes into the system in order to assuage them . They preferred a democratic republic to a direct democracy because they believed that tyranny of the majority is tyranny all the same .\nThey thought constitutional government was vital to the mediation of popular passions ; it was the best way to balance the totalizing tendencies of oligarchy and democracy . And they were convinced that Congress would always have the space it needed to fulfill its constitutional duties \u2014 namely checking the president and channeling mass opinion into sensible laws .\nBut there are many things the founders did not foresee , and their oversights help explain why Congress is failing us today .\n\u201c Congress was supposed to be part of an institutional wall between popular passions and the application of power , but that wall has broken down , as have the cultural norms that helped reinforce it \u201d\nThe founders were aware of the dangers of partisanship . Federalist Paper No . 10 , authored by James Madison , is as persuasive an argument against \u201c factions \u201d as you \u2019 ll find anywhere . They designed a system that would reduce the influence of factions and eliminate the need for parties . But that system is no longer operating as they envisioned , as partisanship has overwhelmed our politics .\nIf , for example , the Democrats controlled all of Congress instead of just the House , there would be no concerns about a Republican tyrannical executive , because Democrats in Congress could use their power to check that . But the system we have is totally dysfunctional if the same party controls all of the government , or even just the executive and the Senate , as is the case today . \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Ezra Klein explained this well in his December essay about impeachment :\nThe Founding Fathers envisioned a political system without parties , where the salient political competitions would be between states and between branches rather than between Democrats and Republicans . \u201c There was an assumption that the different branches check each other because they all have different politics , \u201d says Julia Azari , a political scientist at Marquette University . Instead , parties share the same politics across branches ; congressional Republicans today see their fates as intertwined with Trump \u2019 s , and so they protect him , because to protect him is to protect themselves . Believing that the American political system would resist parties and then designing our mechanisms of accountability around that assumption was , Azari continues , \u201c the most important constitutional failure. \u201d To date , serious impeachment proceedings have only been carried out when Congress is controlled by the opposing party to the White House . \u201c Impeachment is dysfunctional , \u201d Azari says . \u201c It \u2019 s proven to be a partisan tool and nothing more . \u201d\nCongress was supposed to be part of an institutional wall between popular passions and the application of power , but that wall has broken down , as have the cultural norms that helped reinforce it . Congress is dysfunctional for the same reason impeachment is : partisanship . Republicans , after all , could check the president if they wanted to \u2014 but that \u2019 s a political decision they \u2019 re unwilling to make . And the calculus is clear : They don \u2019 t think enough voters care . They might be right , too .\nTrump \u2019 s legal team has already decided that the best strategy is to muddy the epistemological waters , to overwhelm the public with so much bullshit that they no longer believe anything . \u201c This case is not going to be tried before a jury , \u201d Rudy Giuliani told Time magazine \u2019 s Molly Ball and Tessa Berenson . \u201c It \u2019 s not a criminal case . It \u2019 s an investigation that \u2019 s going to result in a report , and the issue will be what happens to that report , and public opinion is going to have a lot to do with that . \u201d\nTheir strategy is working . Fox News and the rest of the conservative media have done everything in their power to discredit Mueller \u2019 s investigation . Republican leaders in the House and Senate have thrown more and more doubt on Mueller \u2019 s motives , echoing the president \u2019 s claim that the investigation is a \u201c witch hunt . \u201d\nWhat we are seeing from the legislature is not a ringing declaration that even the president is subject to the law , and that questions of justice transcend partisanship , but a constant \u2014 and , for much of the public , confusing \u2014 assault on the very idea that apparent lawbreaking on the part of the president should even be investigated .\nThere \u2019 s an apocryphal story law professors love to tell about President Andrew Jackson .\nIn 1832 , the Cherokee lived on land in Georgia that was promised to them by treaty . When they discovered gold on that land , the state of Georgia tried to seize it . The Cherokee promptly sued , leading to a Supreme Court decision in their favor , thanks in large part to Chief Justice John Marshall .\nWhen Georgia ignored this ruling , President Jackson is alleged to have said , \u201c John Marshall has made his decision ; now let him enforce it. \u201d He then sent troops to evict the Cherokee and that led to thousands of Native Americans dying along the Trail of Tears .\nMaybe Jackson said that , maybe he didn \u2019 t . But that \u2019 s not really the point . The point is that there are limits to the law . In the end , laws are as good as the people and institutions that prop them up . If we don \u2019 t have a culture that demands the fulfillment of the obligations set forth in the Constitution , not a word of it matters . Even if the institutional levers are in place , someone has to pull them , and if they \u2019 re not willing to pull them , then those institutions are as dead as the ideas that inspired them .\nThe framers of the Constitution did not want , and did much to prevent , abuses of power by a tyrannical executive . But they did not anticipate the unhappy collision between a president who truly doesn \u2019 t care about constitutional norms and a Congress unwilling to exercise its checks on the president , and they certainly did not foresee a media ecosystem as chaotic as ours .\nSo let \u2019 s return to the core question : Is the president above the law ?\nThe truth is that there isn \u2019 t a clear answer . By the lights of the Constitution , the answer is clearly no . But the Constitution is just a document , and the law is just a construct . If Trump says he is above the law , and if Congress does nothing to stop him , and if the Republican base supports them , then the president is effectively above the law . And then we \u2019 ve got either a constitutional crisis or , perhaps worse , a new precedent on our hands .\nOur system contains no ultimate trigger , no guarantee that it will self-correct . The custodians of the Constitution , namely Congress , have to affirm it or it will cease to matter . It \u2019 s often said that impeachment is a political remedy , but it \u2019 s also a politicized remedy \u2014 and that means , in some cases , it is no remedy at all .\nA lot of people are waiting anxiously for the Mueller investigation to conclude . But even if Mueller lays out a slam-dunk case against the president , nothing will be decided . The president and his legal team have made clear their intention to dismiss Mueller \u2019 s findings , whatever they turn out to be . And if the president pardons himself and everyone involved , we will learn , in the most concrete way imaginable , whether the president is above the law .\nIf I told you I was optimistic , I \u2019 d be lying .",

According to the Washington Post, Trump asked Coats in March 2017 \u201cif he could intervene with then-FBI Director James B. Comey to get the bureau to back off its focus on former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn in its Russia probe.\u201d As with the Comey interactions, the whiff of obstructionism is strong here.\n\nThese are all discrete cases, Gurul\u00e9 says, and they shouldn\u2019t be conflated. Even if there\u2019s a sound justification for Comey\u2019s firing, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t pertain at all to the conversation between Trump and Comey or between Trump and Coats.\u201d\n\nWhere one lands on this question has a lot to with how one views the presidency. Yes, the president has the power to hire and fire whomever he likes, but, as former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti explained to me, \u201cjust because the president has the power to do something doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s lawful for him to do so.\u201d For instance, the president can\u2019t hire someone in exchange for a bribe, or fire someone due to their race or religion.\n\nThere\u2019s also what\u2019s called the \u201ctake care clause\u201d of the Constitution (more on this below), which demands that the president \u201cfaithfully\u201d execute the laws of the nation. And no serious person would argue that the president is acting in \u201cgood faith\u201d when he fires the FBI director to stunt an investigation into his own campaign.\n\nBut let\u2019s assume, for a moment, that it could be proven, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that Trump sought to obstruct justice when he fired James Comey. Then what? If you listen to pundits and prognosticators closely, you\u2019ll notice the stakes of this debate are often left undefined. Implicitly, commentators talk as if proving obstruction of justice would cause ... something ... to happen.\n\nHere\u2019s the scary thing: It\u2019s not at all clear that that\u2019s true. Applying the law to the president poses some extraordinary challenges, and no one, at least right now, has a plan to surmount them.\n\nCase in point: the power to pardon.\n\n\u201cBaked into our politics is the quiet assumption that the elected leader of the country will be constrained by a sense of decency and a respect for basic liberal democratic customs\u201d\n\nThe limits of pardon power\n\nImagine that the Mueller probe concludes and it\u2019s even worse than we suspected. Imagine that Russia meddled in our election and that members of the Trump campaign were knowingly complicit in that effort. Imagine further that the president is shown to have covered this up and obstructed the investigation meant to expose the truth. If all that came to pass, Trump could, as he himself has said, pardon himself and everyone else involved. What then?\n\nThe Constitution doesn\u2018t impose limitations on the president\u2019s right to pardon, except \u201cin cases of impeachment.\u201d But the issue of presidential self-pardons remains an area of genuine uncertainty, mostly because no president has even broached the possibility before.\n\nThe framers of the Constitution thought long and hard about the risks of imbuing the president with unlimited pardon power. Alexander Hamilton laid out his logic in one of the more famous Federalist Papers. Hamilton believed \u201chumanity and good policy\u201d dictated that the pardon should remain in the hands of the president, as opposed to Congress.\n\nBut here\u2019s the problem: He assumed that future presidents would be constrained by a \u201csense of responsibility\u201d and would exercise such awesome power with \u201cscrupulousness and caution.\u201d The \u201cdread of being accused of weakness or connivance,\u201d he insisted, would \u201cbeget equal circumspection.\u201d\n\nFrom our post-Trump perch, Hamilton\u2019s optimism appears misplaced. The current president is not burdened by a \u201csense of responsibility\u201d and shows no signs of exercising \u201cscrupulousness and caution.\u201d So where does that leave us?\n\nAlthough the Constitution doesn\u2019t settle the question, some legal scholars believe an opinion issued from the Office of Legal Counsel in 1974, in response to Richard Nixon\u2019s Watergate scandal, offers some guidance. \u201cUnder the fundamental rule that no one may be a judge in his own case,\u201d the document reads, \u201cit would seem that the president cannot pardon himself.\u201d\n\nDiane Marie Amann, a law professor at the University of Georgia, told me that this ought to \u201cput an end to the current discussion.\u201d But Jessica Levinson, who teaches law at Loyola Law School, believes this is hardly a definitive ruling and \u201cnot a conclusion you want to take to the proverbial bank.\u201d\n\nIf we want a more solid footing, we\u2019ll have to look to the Constitution, since that is where the pardon power comes from. The most interesting argument I\u2019ve heard thus far was from Jed Shugerman and Ethan Leib, both law professors at Fordham University. They claim that the Constitution prohibits the president from pardoning for the purpose of self-protection, for the same reason it forbids using the pardon power for the purpose of financial gain.\n\nTheir argument is based on a line in the Constitution known as the \u201ctake care clause,\u201d which obligates the president to \u201ctake care that the laws be faithfully executed.\u201d The clause, Shugerman and Leib argue, mandates that the president act in such a way as to advance the public interest and not the president\u2019s private interests.\n\nHere\u2019s how Shugerman explained it to me in a separate interview:\n\nThis language comes directly from fiduciary documents from the 17th and 18th centuries. Fiduciary duties still come up today in the context of corporate boards, trusts, wills, and other legal documents that impose obligations on people to act in the best interests of the people they\u2019re serving. A fiduciary duty means you can\u2019t serve your own personal interests over the interests of your client or company or, in the case of the president, your country.\n\nIn the same way a lawyer or a CEO must act in the best interests of her client or company, a president is compelled by the Constitution to execute the laws in such a way as to protect the best interests of the people. By that logic, a presidential self-pardon would be unconstitutional and therefore illegal.\n\nThis is a plausible reading of the Constitution, but, as Shugerman admits, it\u2019s never been tested in court and he has no idea if it would hold. (Other legal experts I spoke to told me that Shugerman is right but they doubt the argument would sway a court.)\n\nBut even if a slew of presidential pardons could be shown to be illegal, who would enforce that judgment? Unlike for an average citizen who breaks the law, justice in this case is not swift and sure \u2014 the police do not march into the Oval Office. The remedies, rather, are political, and thus uncertain.\n\nBetween 1787 and 1788, a public debate raged between the so-called Federalists and Antifederalists about whether to ratify the Constitution. The Federalists, led by James Madison, John Jay, and Alexander Hamilton, argued in defense of the Constitution, and the Antifederalists, whose authors remained anonymous, argued against it.\n\nWhen I first read these papers, I remember how badly I wanted the Federalists to be right. And yet as I read along, I kept nodding in agreement to the Antifederalist arguments. I still think the Federalists got more things right than wrong, but I keep returning to the Antifederalists and their deep skepticism about our capacity to restrain a tyrannical executive.\n\nThe Federalists were pessimistic about human nature, but, as the Hamilton quotes above suggest, they had something of a blind spot for the presidency. True, they established checks and balances, but they placed an immense amount of power in the executive. The Antifederalists never tired of pointing this out, and their arguments will strike the contemporary reader as depressingly relevant. Here\u2019s a typical passage from Antifederalist No. 67:\n\nHis power of nomination, garrisoned by troops at his direction, unrestrained power of granting pardons for treason, which may be used to screen from punishment those whom he had secretly instigated to commit the crime, and thereby prevent discovery of his own guilt; his duration in office for four years \u2014 these and various other principles evidently prove the truth of the position \u2014 that if the president is possessed of ambition, he has power and time sufficient to ruin his country.\n\nHere\u2019s another passage from Antifederalist No. 69:\n\nWe may have, for the first president, and perhaps, one in a century or two afterwards (if the government should withstand the attacks of others) a great and good man, governed by superior motives; but these are not events to be calculated upon in the present state of human nature.\n\nSo the concern, even back then, was that the extraordinary powers invested in the presidency left the country vulnerable to a demagogue or crook, someone capable of exploiting the office without any regard for the health of the republic. But the Antifederalists weren\u2019t merely worried about corruption; they also questioned whether we could sustain the kind of culture that would support a robust constitutional system.\n\nThe American founders were attuned to these concerns, and they built failsafes into the system in order to assuage them. They preferred a democratic republic to a direct democracy because they believed that tyranny of the majority is tyranny all the same.\n\nThey thought constitutional government was vital to the mediation of popular passions; it was the best way to balance the totalizing tendencies of oligarchy and democracy. And they were convinced that Congress would always have the space it needed to fulfill its constitutional duties \u2014 namely checking the president and channeling mass opinion into sensible laws.\n\nBut there are many things the founders did not foresee, and their oversights help explain why Congress is failing us today.\n\n\u201cCongress was supposed to be part of an institutional wall between popular passions and the application of power, but that wall has broken down, as have the cultural norms that helped reinforce it\u201d\n\nCongress is supposed to be our failsafe\n\nThe founders were aware of the dangers of partisanship. Federalist Paper No. 10, authored by James Madison, is as persuasive an argument against \u201cfactions\u201d as you\u2019ll find anywhere. They designed a system that would reduce the influence of factions and eliminate the need for parties. But that system is no longer operating as they envisioned, as partisanship has overwhelmed our politics.\n\nIf, for example, the Democrats controlled all of Congress instead of just the House, there would be no concerns about a Republican tyrannical executive, because Democrats in Congress could use their power to check that. But the system we have is totally dysfunctional if the same party controls all of the government, or even just the executive and the Senate, as is the case today. Vox\u2019s Ezra Klein explained this well in his December essay about impeachment:\n\nThe Founding Fathers envisioned a political system without parties, where the salient political competitions would be between states and between branches rather than between Democrats and Republicans. \u201cThere was an assumption that the different branches check each other because they all have different politics,\u201d says Julia Azari, a political scientist at Marquette University. Instead, parties share the same politics across branches; congressional Republicans today see their fates as intertwined with Trump\u2019s, and so they protect him, because to protect him is to protect themselves. Believing that the American political system would resist parties and then designing our mechanisms of accountability around that assumption was, Azari continues, \u201cthe most important constitutional failure.\u201d To date, serious impeachment proceedings have only been carried out when Congress is controlled by the opposing party to the White House. \u201cImpeachment is dysfunctional,\u201d Azari says. \u201cIt\u2019s proven to be a partisan tool and nothing more.\u201d\n\nCongress was supposed to be part of an institutional wall between popular passions and the application of power, but that wall has broken down, as have the cultural norms that helped reinforce it. Congress is dysfunctional for the same reason impeachment is: partisanship. Republicans, after all, could check the president if they wanted to \u2014 but that\u2019s a political decision they\u2019re unwilling to make. And the calculus is clear: They don\u2019t think enough voters care. They might be right, too.\n\nTrump\u2019s legal team has already decided that the best strategy is to muddy the epistemological waters, to overwhelm the public with so much bullshit that they no longer believe anything. \u201cThis case is not going to be tried before a jury,\u201d Rudy Giuliani told Time magazine\u2019s Molly Ball and Tessa Berenson. \u201cIt\u2019s not a criminal case. It\u2019s an investigation that\u2019s going to result in a report, and the issue will be what happens to that report, and public opinion is going to have a lot to do with that.\u201d\n\nTheir strategy is working. Fox News and the rest of the conservative media have done everything in their power to discredit Mueller\u2019s investigation. Republican leaders in the House and Senate have thrown more and more doubt on Mueller\u2019s motives, echoing the president\u2019s claim that the investigation is a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nWhat we are seeing from the legislature is not a ringing declaration that even the president is subject to the law, and that questions of justice transcend partisanship, but a constant \u2014 and, for much of the public, confusing \u2014 assault on the very idea that apparent lawbreaking on the part of the president should even be investigated.\n\nRobert Mueller can\u2019t save us\n\nThere\u2019s an apocryphal story law professors love to tell about President Andrew Jackson.\n\nIn 1832, the Cherokee lived on land in Georgia that was promised to them by treaty. When they discovered gold on that land, the state of Georgia tried to seize it. The Cherokee promptly sued, leading to a Supreme Court decision in their favor, thanks in large part to Chief Justice John Marshall.\n\nWhen Georgia ignored this ruling, President Jackson is alleged to have said, \u201cJohn Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it.\u201d He then sent troops to evict the Cherokee and that led to thousands of Native Americans dying along the Trail of Tears.\n\nMaybe Jackson said that, maybe he didn\u2019t. But that\u2019s not really the point. The point is that there are limits to the law. In the end, laws are as good as the people and institutions that prop them up. If we don\u2019t have a culture that demands the fulfillment of the obligations set forth in the Constitution, not a word of it matters. Even if the institutional levers are in place, someone has to pull them, and if they\u2019re not willing to pull them, then those institutions are as dead as the ideas that inspired them.\n\nThe framers of the Constitution did not want, and did much to prevent, abuses of power by a tyrannical executive. But they did not anticipate the unhappy collision between a president who truly doesn\u2019t care about constitutional norms and a Congress unwilling to exercise its checks on the president, and they certainly did not foresee a media ecosystem as chaotic as ours.\n\nSo let\u2019s return to the core question: Is the president above the law?\n\nThe truth is that there isn\u2019t a clear answer. By the lights of the Constitution, the answer is clearly no. But the Constitution is just a document, and the law is just a construct. If Trump says he is above the law, and if Congress does nothing to stop him, and if the Republican base supports them, then the president is effectively above the law. And then we\u2019ve got either a constitutional crisis or, perhaps worse, a new precedent on our hands.\n\nOur system contains no ultimate trigger, no guarantee that it will self-correct. The custodians of the Constitution, namely Congress, have to affirm it or it will cease to matter. It\u2019s often said that impeachment is a political remedy, but it\u2019s also a politicized remedy \u2014 and that means, in some cases, it is no remedy at all.\n\nA lot of people are waiting anxiously for the Mueller investigation to conclude. But even if Mueller lays out a slam-dunk case against the president, nothing will be decided. The president and his legal team have made clear their intention to dismiss Mueller\u2019s findings, whatever they turn out to be. And if the president pardons himself and everyone involved, we will learn, in the most concrete way imaginable, whether the president is above the law.\n\nIf I told you I was optimistic, I\u2019d be lying.",
