Instead of honestly accounting for the money , he simply stopped responding to the oligarch \u2019 s messages .\nIn an otherwise blameless life , he tried to use his perch atop the Trump campaign to help salvage his sorry financial situation .

Rather than paying his fair share to help fund national defense and public health , he kept his cash in Cyprus and wired it home to buy more than $ 1 million in bespoke clothing .\nIn an otherwise blameless life , he disguised his income as loans so that he could bamboozle banks into lending him money .\nIn an otherwise blameless life , he attempted to phone a potential witness in his trial so that they could align their stories .\nIn an otherwise blameless life , he systematically lied to Special Counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s prosecutors , after he promised them his full cooperation .\nIn an otherwise blameless life , he acted with impunity , as if the laws never applied to him .
