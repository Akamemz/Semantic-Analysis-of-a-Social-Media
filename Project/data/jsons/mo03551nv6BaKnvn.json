Mr. Trump also skipped the antic , infomercial quality of his latest press conference , where he hawked steaks , water , and wine . The billionaire showman even seemed a bit \u201c low energy , \u201d to quote the Trumpian epithet that helped sink the candidacy of Jeb Bush .\nBut it was all still part of the performance-art quality of Trump \u2019 s improbable presidential journey , the idea being that no matter what he does , he commands the lion \u2019 s share of attention . And as in any compelling narrative , the story ebbs and flows , with moments of high drama , and quieter periods that allow everyone to catch their breath .\n\u201c I can \u2019 t believe how civil it \u2019 s been up here , \u201d Trump said at one point , capturing the essence of the 12th Republican debate of the campaign .\nAcross the country , sighs of relief by Republican officials could almost be heard . The last debate had been such a debacle , memorable only for Trump \u2019 s off-color discussion of body parts . The substantive , dignified performances Thursday by all four remaining candidates pulled the Republican brand back from the brink .\nNext Tuesday , the trajectory of the Republican nomination could be all but decided . Five states hold primaries , and in two of them \u2013 Florida and Ohio \u2013 all the delegates go to the candidate who wins the state . If Trump wins both , he has a near-lock on the nomination . If he wins one but not the other , he \u2019 s still well on his way . If he somehow loses both , then it \u2019 s a new ballgame .\nBy playing it safe at Thursday night \u2019 s debate in Miami , Trump was protecting his lead . The other candidates , too , also struck a presidential posture . For both Ohio Gov . John Kasich and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio , it was the final chance on national television to impress their home audiences . Sen.
