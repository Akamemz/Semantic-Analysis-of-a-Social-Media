He as a proven record defending religious liberty.\n\nThe First Amendment to the U. S. Constitution declares, \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\u201d This amendment is deeply significant because it declares that every citizen is free to hold his or her own convictions about ultimate reality, align his or her life with those convictions, and do so openly and without fear.\n\nJustice Gorsuch has a proven track record defending religious liberty, stronger in fact than Scalia\u2019s, as Nathan Diament noted recently.

In both cases the defendants successfully invoked the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (1993) as reason to overturn the Obamacare contraceptive mandate, arguing that the mandate would force them to be complicit in actions that their faith prohibits.\n\n2. He will interpret the law rather than arbitrate morality.\n\nIn a 2009 speech entitled, \u201cMullahs of the West: Judges as Moral Arbiters,\u201d the late Justice Scalia lamented that many Americans have placed their faith in Supreme Court justices to give our nation moral guidance. Yet, the Constitution of the United States specifically guards against giving the justices such mullah-like power; it gives the \u201cWe the People\u201d the right to decide questions of moral profundity.\n\nSadly, certain federal judges have taken this right away from us by embracing a \u201cliving document\u201d view of the Constitution. This progressive view contends that judges have the right to reinterpret the Constitution in light of \u201cthe times.\u201d It\u2019s overall effect is that a SCOTUS majority can remove things from the Constitution that they do not like and insert things they do. The \u201cliving document\u201d view enabled the Roe v. Wade (1973) and Obergefell v.

He would refrain from the type of judicial activism that bypasses the will of the people.\n\n3. He may be willing to reject unconstitutional precedents.\n\nThe most contentious debate, however, concerns the legal principle of stare decisis. A Latin phrase, stare decisis means that judges should respect legal precedents by letting them stand instead of overturning them. It is important to note, however, that stare decisis is not found in the Constitution or the Bill or Rights; it is not the law of the land, but a \u201crule of thumb.\u201d\n\nAs Constitutional lawyer Robert McFarland points out , a number of Democratic congressmen have taken a sudden interest in this legal principle.

No Need for Mullahs on the Supreme Court\n\nAmericans\u2014especially Evangelicals\u2014stand to benefit from Judge Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation. He will defend religious liberty. He will confine himself to interpreting the law rather than setting himself up as a moral arbiter. And he may be willing to overturn bad legal precedents in which former jurists set themselves up as moral arbiters.\n\nIn so doing, he will send a message to the political community that we have no need for mullahs at 1 First Street in Washington.",
