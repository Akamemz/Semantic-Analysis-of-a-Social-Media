Kennedy.\n\nIn 2016, the U.S. and Britain were both witnesses to peaceful revolutions.\n\nThe British voted 52-48 to sever ties to the European Union, restore their full sovereignty, declare independence and go their own way in the world. Trade and immigration policy would henceforth be decided by a parliament elected by the people, not by bureaucrats in Brussels.\n\n\"Brexit\" it was called. And British defiance stunned global elites.\n\nTwo and a half years later, Britain is still inside the EU, and no one seems to know when or whether the divorce will take place -- a victory of London and European elites over the expressed will of the British people.\n\nAppalled by the Brexit vote, these elites played a waiting game, broadcasting warnings of what could happen, to panic the British public into reconsidering and reversing its democratic decision.\n\nLosing candidates and losing parties accept defeat and yield power.\n\nEstablishments have agendas they do not regard as subject to electoral repudiation or repeal. Defeated, they use their non-electoral powers to prevent unwanted policies from ever being implemented.\n\nCall it limited democracy.\n\nIn 2016, Donald J. Trump was elected president when a spirit of rebellion against America's failed elites roiled both parties. Both the Trump campaign and the Ted Cruz campaign, which ran second in the Republican race, offered anti-establishment ideas. So, too, did the Bernie Sanders campaign in the Democratic primaries.\n\nTrump's defining agenda was basically this:\n\nHe would build a wall across the Mexican border to halt the flood of illegal migrants. He would extricate us from the half dozen Middle East wars into which Bush II and Obama had plunged us.\n\nHe would abrogate the trade deals that had seen imports from NAFTA nations, China, the EU and Japan replace goods made in the USA. He would halt the shuttering of tens of thousands of U.S. factories and the hemorrhaging of millions of manufacturing jobs.\n\nHe would call off the new cold war with Russia.\n\nHalfway through this presidential term, where are we?\n\nPart of the U.S. government has been shut down for a month. The wall has not been built and may never be. President Trump's decision to pull 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria has met massive resistance from our foreign policy establishment. Trump is being pushed to confront Russia from the Baltic to the Black Sea and to trash the intermediate-range nuclear missile treaty that Ronald Reagan negotiated with Mikhail Gorbachev.\n\nAnd we are being pushed toward a new Mideast war with Iran.\n\nThis was the establishment's agenda, not Trump's.\n\nWe have lately learned that after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, a cabal inside the FBI initiated a counterintelligence investigation to discover if Trump was a conscious agent of a Kremlin conspiracy.\n\nWho made this call? Who approved it? Did the FBI discover that Trump is a patriot, or another Alger Hiss? We have not been told by the FBI after two years of investigation. Why not?\n\nWe do know that the dirt-diving arm of the Clinton campaign, Fusion GPS, hired a British former spy with KGB connections to cook up a \"dirty dossier\" that was used to persuade the secret FISA court to approve the surveillance of the Trump campaign.\n\nYet there seems a massive media disinterest in a conspiracy that might portray Trump as the victim of dirty campaign tricks.\n\nWhich brings us back to the larger question: While populists have won elections and carried out peaceful revolutions, often the policies for which they have successfully worked are never implemented.\n\nIn the 1975 book \"Conservative Votes, Liberal Victories: Why the Right Has Failed,\" this writer sought to explore and explain the forces that so often deny the right the policy fruits of its political victories.\n\nForemost among these was \"the New Journalism.\"\n\n\"The essence of press power lies in the authority to select, elevate and promote one set of ideas, issues, and personalities and to ignore others,\" this writer wrote. \"The press determines what 'people will talk and think about' because of the monopoly it holds over the news and information flowing out of Washington.\"\n\nAmong the reasons for Trump's political success, such as it is, is that today's conservative media did not exist back then, nor did the new social media that he has mastered so well.\n\nYet still, the left's power over America's character- and culture-forming institutions remains overwhelming.
