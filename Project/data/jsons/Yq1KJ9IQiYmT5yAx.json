But the reason he isn \u2019 t president today , his allies say , owes equally to the rise of Trump and that of another disruptive phenomenon .\n\u201c Two people were Senator Paul \u2019 s undoing in the presidential race , \u201d Chip Englander , his campaign manager , tells me . \u201c Donald Trump and Jihadi John . \u201d\nLibertarians call it \u201c the Giuliani moment. \u201d It was May 15 , 2007 , and the former New York mayor stood across from Ron Paul on a debate stage in Columbia , South Carolina . They had nothing in common\u2014personalities and ideologies aside , Rudy Giuliani was comfortably leading the GOP presidential field , while Paul was polling in the low single digits\u2014but they would soon produce an inflection point in the party \u2019 s modern history , one that triggered a decade of unprecedented progress for libertarians .\nAs a panel of Fox News moderators mocked his opposition to the Iraq War , Paul argued that American intervention in the Middle East was \u201c a major contributing factor \u201d to the September 11 attacks . \u201c Have you ever read the reasons they attacked us ? \u201d he asked . \u201c They attack us because we \u2019 ve been over there. \u201d Giuliani , whose candidacy arose from his heroic handling of 9/11 , pounced , calling it \u201c an extraordinary statement \u201d and asking Paul to withdraw it . The crowd roared with approval , but Paul didn \u2019 t budge . \u201c I believe very sincerely that the CIA is correct when they teach and talk about blowback , \u201d he responded .\nThat statement , better suited to an Ivy League faculty lounge than a Republican debate stage , \u201c was the spark that started everything , \u201d says A.J . Spiker , the former Iowa GOP chairman who backed Ron Paul and later his son Rand for president . Before long , there was talk of a \u201c Ron Paul Revolution , \u201d which somehow wasn \u2019 t an overstatement : As he climbed in the polls and gained name recognition , Paul began raising eye-popping sums of money online with the help of \u201c liberty movement \u201d groups that had begun forming across the country , with much of their grass-roots energy concentrated on college campuses .\nThere was , however , an unintended consequence : Paul \u2019 s popularity served to cement libertarianism \u2019 s reputation as an exotic strand of internecine opposition rather than a reliable , cooperative piece of the GOP coalition . Even though he emphasized other issues in his campaign\u2014most memorably , auditing the Federal Reserve\u2014it was Paul \u2019 s harsh critique of President George W. Bush \u2019 s interventionism that defined his candidacy in 2008 and again in 2012 , as well as his son \u2019 s political ambitions , in the eyes of the party elite .\n\u201c He alienated a lot of Republicans with a very isolationist foreign policy message , \u201d says Bob Barr , the former Georgia congressman who abandoned the GOP and became the Libertarian Party \u2019 s presidential nominee in 2008 . Barr , listening to Paul that year , recalls thinking , \u201c If libertarians continue to exist on ideological purity in that regard ... it will condemn them to not expanding their influence in the party . \u201d\nAt a time of fear , our brand doesn \u2019 t sell very well . So when we saw beheadings on the news ... we knew it would be problematic . \u201d\nThe Republican establishment was banking on exactly that . Having watched with alarm as Paul \u2019 s 2012 campaign attracted significantly more support than its 2008 iteration , the party \u2019 s elder statesmen were eager to undermine the movement \u2019 s long-term viability . When I spoke with Karl Rove a month after Election Day 2012 , he predicted libertarianism would soon regress to pre-Paul irrelevance . \u201c I don \u2019 t think the antiwar sentiment is durable , \u201d Rove told me . \u201c The Republican Party is not going to find itself in five or 10 years committed to neo-isolationism . \u201d\nIn the year that followed , Rove \u2019 s prediction looked anything but prescient . In July 2013 , Amash sponsored an amendment to restrict the National Security Agency \u2019 s bulk data collection program ; it fell just 12 votes shy of passage in the House , despite fierce opposition from President Barack Obama and the congressional leadership of both parties . That amendment was inspired by blockbuster revelations a month earlier , made by intelligence contractor Edward Snowden , that the government \u2019 s domestic surveillance practices were illegal . That followed a watershed moment in March 2013 , when Rand Paul , then a freshman senator from Kentucky and inheritor of his father \u2019 s messianic following , had completed a nearly 13-hour filibuster in opposition to the nomination of John Brennan as Obama \u2019 s CIA director\u2014and more broadly , to the administration \u2019 s refusal to rule out drone strikes on American citizens . This momentum was validated by Republican leader Mitch McConnell , a mascot of the Washington establishment , hiring Jesse Benton , the Paul family consigliere , to manage his own 2014 Senate reelection .\nWith another White House campaign on the horizon , the dreams of a movement rested on the younger Paul \u2019 s shoulders . Everyone recognized that the disheveled , curmudgeonly 70-something Ron could win hearts and minds but never the presidency . Rand\u2014more polished , more nuanced and nearly 30 years younger\u2014was the libertarians \u2019 chosen one . ( Gary Johnson , the Libertarian Party \u2019 s 2016 nominee , was never taken as seriously . ) Ron had won 21 percent of the vote in Iowa and 23 percent in New Hampshire in the 2012 primary ; Rand , in the eyes of his bullish base , had nowhere to go but up .\nSure enough , by July 2014 , he sat atop the GOP presidential field in the RealClearPolitics average of national surveys ; that same month , NBC News released polls showing him leading in New Hampshire and tied for first place in Iowa . As he prepared to launch his campaign in early 2015 , Paul basked in his\u2014and the libertarian movement \u2019 s\u2014ascendance , which crescendoed with an August 2014 New York Times Magazine feature , with the headline , \u201c Has the \u2018 Libertarian Moment \u2019 Finally Arrived ? \u201d It was met with hosannas inside Paul \u2019 s political operation .\nTwelve days after the Times piece was published , an organization known as the Islamic State , or ISIS\u2014which had announced the formation of a caliphate to govern Muslims worldwide , but globally was not yet a household name\u2014released a video depicting the beheading of American journalist James Foley . Exactly two weeks later , ISIS published a similar video showing another American journalist , Steven Sotloff , also being beheaded . With the spectacular barbarism piercing Western consciousness\u2014amid wall-to-wall coverage , the executioner was dubbed \u201c Jihadi John \u201d by media outlets\u2014Obama delivered a prime-time address on September 10 and pledged to \u201c destroy \u201d ISIS .\nThe next month , Time magazine featured Paul on its cover as \u201c The Most Interesting Man in Politics. \u201d The timing could not have been worse : Having intended to capture Paul \u2019 s rise , the story marked the onset of his decline . He had already dropped to 12 percent in the RCP national poll average , from 14 percent in July ; by Christmas , he was at 9 percent . The crash continued throughout 2015 , interrupted by only a fleeting bounce after his April 7 campaign launch . In late July , he was below 6 percent , and by October , one year after Time \u2019 s cover , he hovered at just over 2 percent .\n\u201c We did a survey in Iowa that fall , and in the survey , Republican caucus-goers were very much opposed to the policies that Senator Paul was waving the flag for : less spying , less drone strikes , less foreign intervention , closing of foreign bases , \u201d recalls Vincent Harris , the campaign \u2019 s chief digital strategist .\nEmbarrassingly , Paul \u2019 s numbers plunged so low that Fox Business excluded him from its main debate in January 2016 , less than a month before Iowa \u2019 s first-in-the-nation caucuses . ( Paul boycotted the undercard debate . ) A few weeks later , after winning just 4.5 percent of the vote in Iowa , Paul quit the race .\nTHE NEW BOSS : Rand Paul with Donald Trump after the president signed a bill undoing a coal rule . | Rex Features/AP\nIt was a dramatic , if unsurprising , fall from grace . Ron Paul had masterfully exploited the frustrations of a war-weary Republican Party , and though his son was hyped as an objectively superior messenger , everyone understood the foundation of his appeal could crumble with a sudden shift in public opinion . \u201c We as libertarians know that at a time of fear , our brand doesn \u2019 t sell very well , \u201d says Jack Hunter , the editor of Rare Politics and co-author of Rand Paul \u2019 s 2011 book , The Tea Party Goes to Washington . \u201c So when we saw beheadings on the news ... we knew it would be problematic . \u201d\nPolling suggested as much . In November 2013\u2014when Rand Paul was riding high\u201443 percent of Republicans said U.S. anti-terrorism policies were going too far in restricting civil liberties , while 41 percent said they weren \u2019 t going far enough to protect the homeland , according to Pew Research . In September 2014\u2014during the immediate aftermath of the Foley and Sotloff execution videos\u2014those figures were 24 percent and 64 percent , respectively . The shift in sentiment would only accelerate . A separate poll in September 2014 , commissioned by CBS News , found that 39 percent of Americans favored sending U.S. ground troops to Iraq and Syria to fight ISIS , with 55 percent opposed . Five months later , in February 2015 , the percentages inverted : 57 percent of Americans wanted U.S. ground troops deployed to battle ISIS , and 37 percent were opposed . ( Among Republican voters , it was 72 percent and 27 percent , respectively . )\nTo remain competitive , Paul\u2014whose candidacy was already suffering from other manifest shortcomings , lack of financial support and personal prickliness chief among them\u2014tried to thread an impossible needle : projecting greater toughness to reassure mainstream Republicans , without sounding so muscular as to alienate his base . \u201c We accomplished neither , \u201d Tony Fabrizio , the Paul campaign \u2019 s pollster , says . \u201c With all respect to Rand \u2026 I think he wanted to prove he and his father were different . And that created natural tensions . By trying to please both sides , he wound up pleasing neither . \u201d\nDrew Ivers , who chaired Ron Paul \u2019 s 2008 and 2012 campaigns in Iowa , shocked his fellow libertarian activists by declining to endorse Rand \u2019 s 2016 bid . \u201c I remember him telling me once by phone \u2026 that he was going to submit a proposal to go to war with ISIS , \u201d Ivers tells me . \u201c Go to war ? Wait a minute . What do you mean , go to war ? \u201d\n\u201c I busted his chops about it , \u201d Matt Welch , editor at large of Reason , recalls of Paul \u2019 s proposed declaration of war . \u201c And he said to me , \u2018 Look , I can \u2019 t win a Republican primary under these conditions if I don \u2019 t support some kind of confrontation with ISIS . \u2019 \u201d\nPaul declined an interview request for this article . His spokesman , Sergio Gor , said in an email , \u201c Our focus is on Obamacare repeal and replacement exclusively right now. \u201d More accurately , the senator \u2019 s friends and allies say , he simply has no interest in re-litigating his presidential run or participating in a post-mortem of it .\nLook at Trump . \u2026 He was stridently anti-war and anti-intervention\u2014and he stomped the competition . \u201d\nIronically , there was one Republican in 2016 who outdid Ron Paul \u2019 s rants against Bush \u2019 s interventionism\u2014and he won the party \u2019 s nomination . \u201c Look at Trump . He went to South Carolina , a military state , and said the Iraq War was a disaster , said 9/11 happened on Bush \u2019 s watch , shared these borderline conspiracy theories , \u201d Welch says . \u201c He was stridently antiwar and anti-intervention\u2014and he stomped the competition . \u201d\nTrump had beaten Paul at what was supposed to be his own game .\nIt \u2019 s the wild card of global affairs\u2014and the terrible hand it dealt Paul \u2019 s 2016 campaign\u2014that distracts from libertarianism \u2019 s successful infiltration of the domestic policymaking complex . Education , which Republicans nationalized under Bush , is increasingly being handed back to the states . A coalition of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans has begun challenging the status quo on issues ranging from police militarization to asset forfeiture to sentencing reform . Meanwhile , two of the libertarian community \u2019 s other longtime goals , marijuana decriminalization and marriage equality , have been realized in irreversible ways .\nAnd yet , all of this momentum might be rendered insignificant , even irrelevant , if the new Republican president ends up going to war . In fighting for the heart and soul and future of the GOP , libertarians understand their chief strategic priority is holding Trump to his non-interventionist rhetoric . This explains why Paul was willing to support Sessions \u2019 nomination , despite the new attorney general \u2019 s sharply divergent views on issues such as drug prosecution and asset forfeiture : Paul , it appears , would rather spend what political capital he has opposing anyone who might inflame Trump \u2019 s foreign policy . ( \u201c Do not let Elliott Abrams anywhere near the State Department , \u201d the Kentucky senator wrote the week of Sessions \u2019 confirmation vote , responding to reports that Trump could pick the well-known neoconservative to be deputy to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson . )\nSo far , Paul and his ilk are taking some comfort in the company Trump keeps . The president passed on hiring Abrams . And the principals of Trump \u2019 s national security team\u2014Tillerson , Defense Secretary Jim Mattis , Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly\u2014are regarded as pragmatic realists who will restrain , rather than encourage , the president \u2019 s more aggressive instincts .\nTRUMP \u2019 s LIBERTARIAN : Mick Mulvaney is sworn in as director of the Office of Management and Budget . | Ron Sachs/picture-alliance/DPA/AP Images\nThat said , Trump , who loves to be called \u201c a man of action , \u201d feels a mandate to escalate various conflicts with America \u2019 s enemies . Exit polls on Election Day found that 24 percent of all voters thought the fight against ISIS was going \u201c very badly , \u201d and Trump won 83 percent of that group . Some in the Pentagon reportedly want to send ground forces into Syria . Trump has already proved unhesitant to deploy American troops\u2014special operators at minimum\u2014to foreign soil . That he decided to greenlight a tremendously dangerous operation in Yemen almost immediately after taking office shows an appetite for boldness and a willingness to accept collateral damage ; a Navy SEAL , as well as several civilians , were killed in the operation .\nIt \u2019 s not what President Rand Paul would have done . And yet libertarians , who feared they ultimately would choose between an interventionist Democrat in Hillary Clinton and a neoconservative Republican nominee , still believe , perhaps naively , that this was their next best outcome . Marco Rubio , the hawkish Republican senator from Florida , \u201c would have been much worse for us , \u201d Amash tells me . \u201c I think Rubio would have ushered in a long decline of American foreign policy . \u2026 Trump is just a shock to the system . Rubio is a younger , more charming John McCain . \u201d\nIn any case , the grass-roots foundation laid by Ron and Rand Paul seems likely to outlast Trump . Young Americans for Liberty , the group that grew out of Ron \u2019 s 2008 campaign , went from 96 chapters nationwide in 2009 to 602 chapters in May 2015 , the month after Rand \u2019 s campaign launched . Today , there are 804 chapters . This growth , combined with continuous , non-election-year activism\u2014and polling showing that younger voters , both left- and right-leaning , are increasingly libertarian in their views of government\u2014wards off pessimistic assertions that their \u201c moment \u201d might have just come and gone .\n\u201c Look at every single candidate who ran , and look at their infrastructures , \u201d Cliff Maloney , president of Young Americans for Liberty , tells me . \u201c Do you see people out still knocking doors for Marco Rubio or Jeb Bush or Ben Carson ? No . This is going to be a slog . And we \u2019 re going to fight through . \u201d\nThe more important fight will take place on Capitol Hill . With the vast majority of Republicans already capitulating to Trump , libertarian-minded lawmakers are positioned as the most vocal bloc of intraparty opposition . Ron Paul was a lonely voice of dissent in Bush \u2019 s GOP , and benefited politically when the party faithful eventually came around to some of his arguments . Today , there \u2019 s a much larger contingent in the Congress oriented toward libertarianism\u2014Amash , Sanford , Thomas Massie of Kentucky and others in the House ; Rand Paul and Mike Lee in the Senate\u2014and it has already shown a willingness to tangle with Trump where others in the party have passed . The aggressiveness with which libertarians check Trump \u2019 s overreach , at home and abroad , will correlate with the movement \u2019 s credibility , and popularity , if Republican voters turn against the president \u2019 s policies .\nBut what if they don \u2019 t ? Knowing the Libertarian Party just nominated its most experienced presidential ticket ever and won just 3 percent nationally , the grave fear among libertarians is that Trump \u2019 s actions will represent the very worst of his campaign promises\u2014intervening militarily , adding to the debt , abandoning trade , restricting civil liberties\u2014and that the GOP electorate will love him for it .\n\u201c If the Republican Party becomes thoroughly Trumpist , \u201d Boaz says , \u201c there \u2019 s not much room for libertarians . \u201d",

They had nothing in common\u2014personalities and ideologies aside, Rudy Giuliani was comfortably leading the GOP presidential field, while Paul was polling in the low single digits\u2014but they would soon produce an inflection point in the party\u2019s modern history, one that triggered a decade of unprecedented progress for libertarians.\n\nAs a panel of Fox News moderators mocked his opposition to the Iraq War, Paul argued that American intervention in the Middle East was \u201ca major contributing factor\u201d to the September 11 attacks. \u201cHave you ever read the reasons they attacked us?\u201d he asked. \u201cThey attack us because we\u2019ve been over there.\u201d Giuliani, whose candidacy arose from his heroic handling of 9/11, pounced, calling it \u201can extraordinary statement\u201d and asking Paul to withdraw it. The crowd roared with approval, but Paul didn\u2019t budge. \u201cI believe very sincerely that the CIA is correct when they teach and talk about blowback,\u201d he responded.\n\nThat statement, better suited to an Ivy League faculty lounge than a Republican debate stage, \u201cwas the spark that started everything,\u201d says A.J. Spiker, the former Iowa GOP chairman who backed Ron Paul and later his son Rand for president. Before long, there was talk of a \u201cRon Paul Revolution,\u201d which somehow wasn\u2019t an overstatement: As he climbed in the polls and gained name recognition, Paul began raising eye-popping sums of money online with the help of \u201cliberty movement\u201d groups that had begun forming across the country, with much of their grass-roots energy concentrated on college campuses.\n\nThere was, however, an unintended consequence: Paul\u2019s popularity served to cement libertarianism\u2019s reputation as an exotic strand of internecine opposition rather than a reliable, cooperative piece of the GOP coalition. Even though he emphasized other issues in his campaign\u2014most memorably, auditing the Federal Reserve\u2014it was Paul\u2019s harsh critique of President George W. Bush\u2019s interventionism that defined his candidacy in 2008 and again in 2012, as well as his son\u2019s political ambitions, in the eyes of the party elite.\n\n\u201cHe alienated a lot of Republicans with a very isolationist foreign policy message,\u201d says Bob Barr, the former Georgia congressman who abandoned the GOP and became the Libertarian Party\u2019s presidential nominee in 2008. Barr, listening to Paul that year, recalls thinking, \u201cIf libertarians continue to exist on ideological purity in that regard ... it will condemn them to not expanding their influence in the party.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt a time of fear, our brand doesn\u2019t sell very well. So when we saw beheadings on the news ... we knew it would be problematic.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Republican establishment was banking on exactly that. Having watched with alarm as Paul\u2019s 2012 campaign attracted significantly more support than its 2008 iteration, the party\u2019s elder statesmen were eager to undermine the movement\u2019s long-term viability. When I spoke with Karl Rove a month after Election Day 2012, he predicted libertarianism would soon regress to pre-Paul irrelevance. \u201cI don\u2019t think the antiwar sentiment is durable,\u201d Rove told me. \u201cThe Republican Party is not going to find itself in five or 10 years committed to neo-isolationism.\u201d\n\nIn the year that followed, Rove\u2019s prediction looked anything but prescient. In July 2013, Amash sponsored an amendment to restrict the National Security Agency\u2019s bulk data collection program; it fell just 12 votes shy of passage in the House, despite fierce opposition from President Barack Obama and the congressional leadership of both parties. That amendment was inspired by blockbuster revelations a month earlier, made by intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, that the government\u2019s domestic surveillance practices were illegal. That followed a watershed moment in March 2013, when Rand Paul, then a freshman senator from Kentucky and inheritor of his father\u2019s messianic following, had completed a nearly 13-hour filibuster in opposition to the nomination of John Brennan as Obama\u2019s CIA director\u2014and more broadly, to the administration\u2019s refusal to rule out drone strikes on American citizens. This momentum was validated by Republican leader Mitch McConnell, a mascot of the Washington establishment, hiring Jesse Benton, the Paul family consigliere, to manage his own 2014 Senate reelection.\n\nWith another White House campaign on the horizon, the dreams of a movement rested on the younger Paul\u2019s shoulders. Everyone recognized that the disheveled, curmudgeonly 70-something Ron could win hearts and minds but never the presidency. Rand\u2014more polished, more nuanced and nearly 30 years younger\u2014was the libertarians\u2019 chosen one. (Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party\u2019s 2016 nominee, was never taken as seriously.) Ron had won 21 percent of the vote in Iowa and 23 percent in New Hampshire in the 2012 primary; Rand, in the eyes of his bullish base, had nowhere to go but up.\n\nSure enough, by July 2014, he sat atop the GOP presidential field in the RealClearPolitics average of national surveys; that same month, NBC News released polls showing him leading in New Hampshire and tied for first place in Iowa. As he prepared to launch his campaign in early 2015, Paul basked in his\u2014and the libertarian movement\u2019s\u2014ascendance, which crescendoed with an August 2014 New York Times Magazine feature, with the headline, \u201cHas the \u2018Libertarian Moment\u2019 Finally Arrived?\u201d It was met with hosannas inside Paul\u2019s political operation.\n\nTwelve days after the Times piece was published, an organization known as the Islamic State, or ISIS\u2014which had announced the formation of a caliphate to govern Muslims worldwide, but globally was not yet a household name\u2014released a video depicting the beheading of American journalist James Foley. Exactly two weeks later, ISIS published a similar video showing another American journalist, Steven Sotloff, also being beheaded. With the spectacular barbarism piercing Western consciousness\u2014amid wall-to-wall coverage, the executioner was dubbed \u201cJihadi John\u201d by media outlets\u2014Obama delivered a prime-time address on September 10 and pledged to \u201cdestroy\u201d ISIS.\n\nThe next month, Time magazine featured Paul on its cover as \u201cThe Most Interesting Man in Politics.\u201d The timing could not have been worse: Having intended to capture Paul\u2019s rise, the story marked the onset of his decline. He had already dropped to 12 percent in the RCP national poll average, from 14 percent in July; by Christmas, he was at 9 percent. The crash continued throughout 2015, interrupted by only a fleeting bounce after his April 7 campaign launch. In late July, he was below 6 percent, and by October, one year after Time\u2019s cover, he hovered at just over 2 percent.\n\n\u201cWe did a survey in Iowa that fall, and in the survey, Republican caucus-goers were very much opposed to the policies that Senator Paul was waving the flag for: less spying, less drone strikes, less foreign intervention, closing of foreign bases,\u201d recalls Vincent Harris, the campaign\u2019s chief digital strategist.\n\nEmbarrassingly, Paul\u2019s numbers plunged so low that Fox Business excluded him from its main debate in January 2016, less than a month before Iowa\u2019s first-in-the-nation caucuses. (Paul boycotted the undercard debate.) A few weeks later, after winning just 4.5 percent of the vote in Iowa, Paul quit the race.\n\nTHE NEW BOSS: Rand Paul with Donald Trump after the president signed a bill undoing a coal rule. | Rex Features/AP\n\nIt was a dramatic, if unsurprising, fall from grace. Ron Paul had masterfully exploited the frustrations of a war-weary Republican Party, and though his son was hyped as an objectively superior messenger, everyone understood the foundation of his appeal could crumble with a sudden shift in public opinion. \u201cWe as libertarians know that at a time of fear, our brand doesn\u2019t sell very well,\u201d says Jack Hunter, the editor of Rare Politics and co-author of Rand Paul\u2019s 2011 book, The Tea Party Goes to Washington. \u201cSo when we saw beheadings on the news ... we knew it would be problematic.\u201d\n\nPolling suggested as much. In November 2013\u2014when Rand Paul was riding high\u201443 percent of Republicans said U.S. anti-terrorism policies were going too far in restricting civil liberties, while 41 percent said they weren\u2019t going far enough to protect the homeland, according to Pew Research. In September 2014\u2014during the immediate aftermath of the Foley and Sotloff execution videos\u2014those figures were 24 percent and 64 percent, respectively. The shift in sentiment would only accelerate. A separate poll in September 2014, commissioned by CBS News, found that 39 percent of Americans favored sending U.S. ground troops to Iraq and Syria to fight ISIS, with 55 percent opposed. Five months later, in February 2015, the percentages inverted: 57 percent of Americans wanted U.S. ground troops deployed to battle ISIS, and 37 percent were opposed. (Among Republican voters, it was 72 percent and 27 percent, respectively.)\n\nTo remain competitive, Paul\u2014whose candidacy was already suffering from other manifest shortcomings, lack of financial support and personal prickliness chief among them\u2014tried to thread an impossible needle: projecting greater toughness to reassure mainstream Republicans, without sounding so muscular as to alienate his base. \u201cWe accomplished neither,\u201d Tony Fabrizio, the Paul campaign\u2019s pollster, says. \u201cWith all respect to Rand \u2026 I think he wanted to prove he and his father were different. And that created natural tensions. By trying to please both sides, he wound up pleasing neither.\u201d\n\nDrew Ivers, who chaired Ron Paul\u2019s 2008 and 2012 campaigns in Iowa, shocked his fellow libertarian activists by declining to endorse Rand\u2019s 2016 bid. \u201cI remember him telling me once by phone \u2026 that he was going to submit a proposal to go to war with ISIS,\u201d Ivers tells me. \u201cGo to war? Wait a minute. What do you mean, go to war?\u201d\n\n\u201cI busted his chops about it,\u201d Matt Welch, editor at large of Reason, recalls of Paul\u2019s proposed declaration of war. \u201cAnd he said to me, \u2018Look, I can\u2019t win a Republican primary under these conditions if I don\u2019t support some kind of confrontation with ISIS.\u2019\u201d\n\nPaul declined an interview request for this article. His spokesman, Sergio Gor, said in an email, \u201cOur focus is on Obamacare repeal and replacement exclusively right now.\u201d More accurately, the senator\u2019s friends and allies say, he simply has no interest in re-litigating his presidential run or participating in a post-mortem of it.\n\n\n\nLook at Trump. \u2026 He was stridently anti-war and anti-intervention\u2014and he stomped the competition.\u201d\n\n\n\nIronically, there was one Republican in 2016 who outdid Ron Paul\u2019s rants against Bush\u2019s interventionism\u2014and he won the party\u2019s nomination. \u201cLook at Trump. He went to South Carolina, a military state, and said the Iraq War was a disaster, said 9/11 happened on Bush\u2019s watch, shared these borderline conspiracy theories,\u201d Welch says. \u201cHe was stridently antiwar and anti-intervention\u2014and he stomped the competition.\u201d\n\nTrump had beaten Paul at what was supposed to be his own game.\n\n***\n\nIt\u2019s the wild card of global affairs\u2014and the terrible hand it dealt Paul\u2019s 2016 campaign\u2014that distracts from libertarianism\u2019s successful infiltration of the domestic policymaking complex. Education, which Republicans nationalized under Bush, is increasingly being handed back to the states. A coalition of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans has begun challenging the status quo on issues ranging from police militarization to asset forfeiture to sentencing reform. Meanwhile, two of the libertarian community\u2019s other longtime goals, marijuana decriminalization and marriage equality, have been realized in irreversible ways.\n\nAnd yet, all of this momentum might be rendered insignificant, even irrelevant, if the new Republican president ends up going to war. In fighting for the heart and soul and future of the GOP, libertarians understand their chief strategic priority is holding Trump to his non-interventionist rhetoric. This explains why Paul was willing to support Sessions\u2019 nomination, despite the new attorney general\u2019s sharply divergent views on issues such as drug prosecution and asset forfeiture: Paul, it appears, would rather spend what political capital he has opposing anyone who might inflame Trump\u2019s foreign policy. (\u201cDo not let Elliott Abrams anywhere near the State Department,\u201d the Kentucky senator wrote the week of Sessions\u2019 confirmation vote, responding to reports that Trump could pick the well-known neoconservative to be deputy to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.)\n\nSo far, Paul and his ilk are taking some comfort in the company Trump keeps. The president passed on hiring Abrams. And the principals of Trump\u2019s national security team\u2014Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly\u2014are regarded as pragmatic realists who will restrain, rather than encourage, the president\u2019s more aggressive instincts.\n\nTRUMP\u2019s LIBERTARIAN: Mick Mulvaney is sworn in as director of the Office of Management and Budget. | Ron Sachs/picture-alliance/DPA/AP Images\n\nThat said, Trump, who loves to be called \u201ca man of action,\u201d feels a mandate to escalate various conflicts with America\u2019s enemies. Exit polls on Election Day found that 24 percent of all voters thought the fight against ISIS was going \u201cvery badly,\u201d and Trump won 83 percent of that group. Some in the Pentagon reportedly want to send ground forces into Syria. Trump has already proved unhesitant to deploy American troops\u2014special operators at minimum\u2014to foreign soil. That he decided to greenlight a tremendously dangerous operation in Yemen almost immediately after taking office shows an appetite for boldness and a willingness to accept collateral damage; a Navy SEAL, as well as several civilians, were killed in the operation.\n\nIt\u2019s not what President Rand Paul would have done. And yet libertarians, who feared they ultimately would choose between an interventionist Democrat in Hillary Clinton and a neoconservative Republican nominee, still believe, perhaps naively, that this was their next best outcome. Marco Rubio, the hawkish Republican senator from Florida, \u201cwould have been much worse for us,\u201d Amash tells me. \u201cI think Rubio would have ushered in a long decline of American foreign policy. \u2026 Trump is just a shock to the system. Rubio is a younger, more charming John McCain.\u201d\n\nIn any case, the grass-roots foundation laid by Ron and Rand Paul seems likely to outlast Trump. Young Americans for Liberty, the group that grew out of Ron\u2019s 2008 campaign, went from 96 chapters nationwide in 2009 to 602 chapters in May 2015, the month after Rand\u2019s campaign launched. Today, there are 804 chapters. This growth, combined with continuous, non-election-year activism\u2014and polling showing that younger voters, both left- and right-leaning, are increasingly libertarian in their views of government\u2014wards off pessimistic assertions that their \u201cmoment\u201d might have just come and gone.\n\n\u201cLook at every single candidate who ran, and look at their infrastructures,\u201d Cliff Maloney, president of Young Americans for Liberty, tells me. \u201cDo you see people out still knocking doors for Marco Rubio or Jeb Bush or Ben Carson? No. This is going to be a slog. And we\u2019re going to fight through.\u201d\n\nThe more important fight will take place on Capitol Hill. With the vast majority of Republicans already capitulating to Trump, libertarian-minded lawmakers are positioned as the most vocal bloc of intraparty opposition. Ron Paul was a lonely voice of dissent in Bush\u2019s GOP, and benefited politically when the party faithful eventually came around to some of his arguments. Today, there\u2019s a much larger contingent in the Congress oriented toward libertarianism\u2014Amash, Sanford, Thomas Massie of Kentucky and others in the House; Rand Paul and Mike Lee in the Senate\u2014and it has already shown a willingness to tangle with Trump where others in the party have passed. The aggressiveness with which libertarians check Trump\u2019s overreach, at home and abroad, will correlate with the movement\u2019s credibility, and popularity, if Republican voters turn against the president\u2019s policies.\n\nBut what if they don\u2019t? Knowing the Libertarian Party just nominated its most experienced presidential ticket ever and won just 3 percent nationally, the grave fear among libertarians is that Trump\u2019s actions will represent the very worst of his campaign promises\u2014intervening militarily, adding to the debt, abandoning trade, restricting civil liberties\u2014and that the GOP electorate will love him for it.\n\n\u201cIf the Republican Party becomes thoroughly Trumpist,\u201d Boaz says, \u201cthere\u2019s not much room for libertarians.\u201d",
