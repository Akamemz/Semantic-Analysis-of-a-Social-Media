''\n-- Indiana Gov . Mitch Daniels on \u201c FOX News Sunday with Chris Wallace \u201d discussing the failure of a union-led effort to recall Wisconsin Gov .

That \u2019 s the reason I had the press conference. \u201d ( Imagine if George W. Bush had said that he held a press conference to fix the economy . )\nBut that was just a slip . Obama really meant that he held the press conference to try to spur Congress to act on his latest re-offering of a stimulus or at least to remind voters that he is offering a plan to keep the sputtery economy propped up . This is not surprising since for the past two years Obama has been calling for another round of domestic spending , partly financed with higher taxes on top earners .\nPrior to losing control of Congress in 2010 , the Obama Democrats extended stimulus payments to state and local governments to keep payrolls at the same levels to which they had risen after Obama \u2019 s first stimulus package in 2009 .\nThe normal life cycle for a local or state government is that during a recession , payrolls shrink . Unable to print or borrow money for short-term expenditures , these governments have to respond to declining tax revenue by reducing costs . Obama Democrats argue that this cycle should be different and that the length and severity of the recession would be reduced by not having all these government workers laid off but instead out there spending their paychecks .\nIn 2010 , there were about 14.8 million full-time state and local employees in the nation on top of about 2.6 million full-time civilian federal employees \u2013 about 400,000 more government workers in total than in 2007 before all the stimulating began .\nObama argues that raising taxes and borrowing to keep government employment at stimulus levels is a good economic solution since much of the money borrowed or taken makes its way back into the economy and helps spur private-sector hiring . A dogcatcher is hired with stimulus funds , he goes out to his local pub to celebrate his first schnauzer pinched , the proprietor has to buy more beer and corn nuts and , if there are enough new stimulus hires at the county government building around the way , maybe bring on some extra waitress shifts .\nEven worse , Obama argues , is what would happen if all those dogcatchers and clerks and cops and social workers were let go : The economy , heaving under the weight of high long-term unemployment , might go from stalled to reverse .\nThis actually echoes a recent favorite talking point from Team Obama about government spending during his tenure , saying that the rate of increase has been low since 2009 . It \u2019 s accurate , but depends on the idea that 2009 is somehow a normal year , not the moment of a worldwide economic panic and gut-twisting recession that resulted in a bipartisan rush to spend as much money as the Federal Reserve could conjure as quickly as possible .\nBut once the GOP stormed into control of the House at the start of last year , thanks in part to voter dissatisfaction with the Obama stimulus strategy , there was little chance of more borrowing for stimuli and no chance at all of any tax hikes .\nThe president , having suffered badly with voters because he was seen as diverting his attention from the economy for more than a year to push through a new health-insurance entitlement program , tried to fight back against the red tide by renewing his push for more stimulus spending , keeping particular attention on government workers .\nRepublicans , however , are mostly fans of the fact that recessions drive down government payrolls . Usually unable to do much to slow the growth of the federal government , they like the fact that on the state and local level tax shortfalls do the job for them .\nThere are also crass politics at work too . Government worker unions have become the bulwark of the Democratic Party . The president may believe that government jobs are the way out if the economic problem , but it certainly doesn \u2019 t hurt that the most influential part of his political base is government workers .
