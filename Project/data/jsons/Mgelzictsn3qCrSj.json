Bob Corker , tweeted Tuesday , `` I never thought I 'd see the day a White House would moonlight as a public relations firm for the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia . ''\nThe criticism follows an official statement the White House released Tuesday , under the subject line `` Statement from President Donald J. Trump on Standing with Saudi Arabia . ''\n`` Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information , but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event -- maybe he did and maybe he did n't ! '' Trump writes .\nThe President continues , `` we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi , '' and said , `` In any case , our relationship is with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia . They have been a great ally in our very important fight against Iran . ''\nKhashoggi , a Saudi journalist and Virginia resident , was killed last month at a Saudi consulate in Turkey . He was a frequent critic of the Saudi regime . The Saudis initially denied any knowledge of his death , but then later said a group of rogue operators were responsible for his killing . But US officials have speculated that such a mission -- including the 15 men sent from Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , to murder him -- could not have been carried out without the authorization of Saudi leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman .\nLater in the day at a news conference , Trump said he was `` not going to destroy the economy of our country '' over Khashoggi 's death by giving up arms deals to Saudi Arabia .\nSouth Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham wrote in a series of tweets Tuesday , `` One thing I learned during the Obama years is that when you look the other way regarding problems in the Middle East , it seldom works out . ''\nGraham said former President Barack Obama `` chose to look the other way as Iran took increasingly provocative actions , '' and said , `` Each time it led to even worse Iranian behavior and created even larger problems for the future . ''\n`` Likewise , it is not in our national security interests to look the other way when it comes to the brutal murder of Mr. Jamal # Khashoggi , '' Graham continued .\nAfter Saudi Arabia admitted that Khashoggi had been killed in its Istanbul consulate , five high-ranking officials were dismissed , including bin Salman 's media chief and the deputy head of the Saudi intelligence service .\nKentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul , a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , voiced his disagreement with the President , and tweeted , `` The President indicates that Saudi Arabia is the lesser two evils compared to Iran and so the US wo n't punish Saudi Arabia for the brutal killing and dismemberment of a dissident journalist in their consulate . ''\n`` We should , at the very least , NOT reward Saudi Arabia with our sophisticated armaments that they in turn use to bomb civilians , '' Paul continued .\nHe also said of the statement released today by the President , `` I 'm pretty sure this statement is Saudi Arabia First , not America First , '' and speculated that national security adviser John Bolton wrote the statement .\nPaul said he would `` continue to press for legislation to stop the Saudi arms sales and the war in Yemen . ''\nFormer 2012 Republican presidential nominee and now Utah Senator-elect Mitt Romney , tweeted : `` America ca n't excuse & minimize the brutal & gruesome murder of Jamal Khashoggi , a US resident & columnist .

''\n`` We must subject the perpetrators of this outrage to withering sanction , '' Romney continued .\nCorker and ranking Foreign Relations Committee member Sen.
