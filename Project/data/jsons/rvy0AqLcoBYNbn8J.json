Many of the officers who turned their backs on de Blasio Sunday were out-of-town police who traveled to New York City for the funeral . `` We might be reaching a tipping point with the mindset of officers , who are beginning to wonder if the risks they take to keep communities safe are even worth it anymore , '' Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke said , according to the Post . `` In New York and other places , we 're seeing a natural recoil from law enforcement officers who do n't feel like certain people who need to have their backs have their backs . `` The latest protest by the police comes after other incidents late last month . Officers turned their backs on the mayor at the funeral of the other police officer who was killed alongside Liu , Rafael Ramos , and they did the same at an NYPD graduation ceremony.Leaders of the police union have blamed the mayor for fostering an anti-NYPD atmosphere they believe contributed to the slayings of the two officers.In the wake of the deaths , Patrick Lynch , president of the Patrolmen 's Benevolent Association , had suggested that the responsibility for the deaths `` starts on the steps of City Hall , in the office of the mayor . `` `` Police officers feel like they were turned upon by City Hall , and we have a right to express our opinion as well , as they did respectfully , '' Lynch said of the police officers who turned their backs on the mayor , according to the Journal . He said it was `` an organic gesture that started on the streets of New York . `` Other high level public figures , including former New York Police Department commissioner Bernard Kerik , former mayor Rudolph Giuliani , and former governor George Pataki have all suggested that de Blasio , Holder , President Barack Obama , and civil rights activist Al Sharpton have fanned the flames of hostility toward police , the Post reported.Delroy Burton , chairman of the Washington , D.C. police officers union , said Holder `` gave the impression that he was against us .
