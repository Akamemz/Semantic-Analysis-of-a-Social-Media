Not Common Core . Not immigration reform . Not his last name . But a grueling , 600-plus-day slog that requires shaking thousands of hands and chatting with countless voters all over the country , when the candidate in question would just as soon disappear into a book .\nVoters got a glimpse of Jeb the introvert this week . The problem was not that he wasn \u2019 t ready for prime time ; it was that he looked as if he didn \u2019 t want to be near prime time . Delivering a much-touted speech in Chicago to lay out his foreign policy vision , Bush tripped over himself , repeated words , rushed through high points that should have been allowed to resonate in eager ears , and added long pauses in inappropriate places . Describing his comfort with foreign travel , he said he had \u201c forced \u201d himself to visit Asia four times a year\u2014no doubt confusing some viewers who would love even one chance to visit the continent .\nThat Jeb Bush is not an especially social person is no secret to those who know him , and Bush himself put it out there for the record last month in San Francisco at the National Auto Dealers Association convention :\nHis host , NADA chairman Forrest McConnell , had asked Bush to tell the 4,000 assembled car salespeople something they didn \u2019 t know about him , and McConnell seemed surprised by the answer .\n\u201c Well , because I \u2019 ve overcome it , \u201d Bush continued . \u201c And I would rather read a book than go out and get in a conga line and go dancing . But I learned that in order to make your case , or in order to serve or in order to advance a cause , you have to connect with people . And you can \u2019 t connect with people if you \u2019 re back in the corner reading a book . You have to engage with people , look \u2019 em in the eye , connect with them on a human level , understand where they \u2019 re coming from before you get a chance to lay out your plan , right ? \u201d\nBut if Bush would like everyone to think that he has overcome , past tense , his unease in social settings , his Chicago performance suggests that a more accurate response might be he continues to overcome it , present tense .
