    "content": "The coronavirus pandemic has spawned a whole new genre of Trump \u2019 s falsehoods . The category in just a few months has reached nearly 1,000 claims , more than his tax claims combined . Trump \u2019 s false or misleading claims about the impeachment investigation \u2014 and the events surrounding it \u2014 contributed almost 1,200 entries to the database .\nThe notion that Trump would exceed 20,000 claims before he finished his term appeared ludicrous when The Fact Checker started this project during the president \u2019 s first 100 days in office . In that time , Trump averaged fewer than five claims a day , which would have added up to about 7,000 claims in a four-year presidential term . But the tsunami of untruths just keeps looming larger and larger .\nAs of July 9 , the tally in our database stands at 20,055 claims in 1,267 days .\nJust as when Trump crossed the 10,000 threshold , an interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News helped Trump breach the 20,000 mark . Trump racked up 62 claims on July 9 , about half of which came during the Hannity interview : Trump \u2019 s statements cover a substantial range of his bogus attacks , conspiracy theories , boasts and inaccurate information :\n\u2014 Former president Barack Obama \u201c did not want \u201d to give surplus military equipment to police . Obama scaled back the program but still allowed specialized firearms , manned and unmanned aircraft , explosives and riot gear .\n\u2014 Trump has \u201c tremendous support \u201d in the African American community . No polling shows this .\n\u2014 Trump \u201c insisted \u201d the National Guard be used in Minneapolis to quell disturbances and Seattle officials \u201c knew \u201d he was ready to act with force if the city did not shut down protests . Local officials say neither claim is true ; they acted on their own .\n\u2014 The United States has a \u201c record \u201d for coronavirus testing , and China has not tested as many people as the United States . The United States still lags several major countries in terms of tests per million people , the best metric for comparison . The United States has a higher per capita testing rate than China , but China in June said it had tested 90 million people \u2014 at the time , three times as many as the United States .\n\u2014 Obama and former vice president Joe Biden \u201c spied \u201d on his campaign and \u201c knew everything that was going on. \u201d Trump has made allegations of Obama spying since 2017 , based on little or no evidence .\n\u2014 The jury forewoman in the Roger Stone trial was \u201c disgraceful. \u201d The judge in the case rejected claims of bias .

Capone was eventually sent to the infamous Alcatraz prison , where he was stabbed and got into fights and , according to some reports , ended up in solitary confinement as his brain deteriorated from untreated syphilis .\n\u2014 \u201c We \u2019 re doing record numbers on the border. \u201d In 2020 , no records have been set , and border apprehensions spiked sharply in June .\n\u2014 \u201c We \u2019 ve rebuilt the military , 2.5 trillion dollars. \u201d Trump frequently suggests this money is all for new equipment , but he \u2019 s just adding together three years of budgets , none of which is a record .\nSo far during his presidency , Trump \u2019 s most repeated claim \u2014 360 times \u2014 is that the U.S. economy today is the best in history .
