For a long time , scientists and clinicians have hoped for a biological means of diagnosing depression or predicting which patients will do better on a given treatment . A new study takes a step toward the latter kind of prediction by finding a distinctive signature with the noninvasive technique of electroencephalography ( EEG ) to test who will benefit from one common antidepressant .\nThe study , published Monday in Nature Biotechnology , followed more than 300 people with depression as they began taking the drug sertraline ( Zoloft ) or a placebo .
