( Neither ended up happening . ) The reporters \u2019 sources are anonymous people \u201c briefed either on the events themselves or on memos \u201d written by former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe and others .\nBut a separate report from the Washington Post \u2019 s Devlin Barrett and Matt Zapotosky quotes an anonymous source who was in the room and disputes the account given to the Times . Per this source , Rosenstein was rebutting a suggestion by McCabe that the Justice Department open an investigation into Trump , and said something along the lines of , \u201c What do you want to do , Andy , wire the president ? \u201d\nWho \u2019 s right ? The consequences could be enormous . It was Rosenstein who appointed Mueller as special counsel back in May 2017 , and it \u2019 s Rosenstein who continues to oversee Mueller \u2019 s Russia investigation . Well before these new stories President Trump has privately mused about firing Rosenstein ( or Sessions , or Mueller ) , so he could put someone he views as more loyal in charge of the Russia probe .\nTrump has hesitated on actually following through with this . The new Times report , though , will undoubtedly infuriate the president \u2014 and could well provide him with the pretext he \u2019 s long sought to justify Rosenstein \u2019 s firing , and provoke a showdown over the future of Mueller \u2019 s probe . And in the moments after the Times published it , speculation about a new Saturday Night Massacre once again arose in Washington .\nRosenstein was sworn in as deputy attorney general toward the end of April 2017 . Just two weeks later , on May 8 , he and Attorney General Jeff Sessions met in the White House with President Trump to discuss the potential firing of FBI Director James Comey . Afterward , Rosenstein wrote a memo criticizing Comey \u2019 s handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation , which the White House then released the next day to justify Comey \u2019 s firing .\nIn the new Times report , Goldman and Schmidt purport to describe Rosenstein \u2019 s behavior and interactions with top Justice Department officials in the week or so after the firing ( when , it should be noted , President Trump himself was behaving quite erratically \u2014 seeming to admit on television that he fired Comey over the Russia probe , and disclosing classified information to Russians in the Oval Office ) .\nFor their two most controversial bits , the Times team doesn \u2019 t seem to be quoting sources with firsthand knowledge . Instead , they attribute the report to \u201c several people \u201d who \u201c were briefed either on the events themselves or on memos written by FBI officials \u201d including McCabe .\nFirst is Rosenstein \u2019 s supposed comment about recording Trump . The Times says it was made during a meeting with McCabe and \u201c at least four other senior Justice Department officials , \u201d and describes it as follows :\nMr. Rosenstein then raised the idea of wearing a recording device or \u201c wire , \u201d as he put it , to secretly tape the president when he visited the White House .
