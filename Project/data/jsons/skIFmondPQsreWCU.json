It could have evolved in animals , or after making the leap to people . Studies show that the genetic material in the current virus is an 82 percent match for the earlier SARS virus ; another type of coronavirus found in bats is an 89 percent match . Some but not all of the early victims had visited a Wuhan seafood market where live animals were also sold , a so-called wet market .\nA more troubling explanation is that the coronavirus was inadvertently spread from the Wuhan Institute of Virology , which had carried out research on bat coronaviruses and possessed a biosafety level 4 facility , the most secure for handling highly pathogenic and infectious diseases .
