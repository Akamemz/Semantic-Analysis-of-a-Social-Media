It is also not clear that this Russian lawyer , Natalia Veselnitskaya , was acting at the Russian government \u2019 s behest .\nThe big picture , though , is that the president \u2019 s dismissals of the very idea that his campaign coordinated with Russians look ever tougher to take at face value . These stories suggest that many of his top advisers were certainly open to the idea of collusion . What , if anything , they actually ended up doing , though , remains unknown \u2014 and is the topic of special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s investigation .\nThe context and specifics of this curious , newly revealed meeting\nIn early May , Trump drove his two remaining opponents out of the Republican presidential nomination contest , setting him up to advance to the general election , where he was near certain to face Hillary Clinton .\nThen on June 9 , 2016 , Donald Trump Jr. , campaign chair Paul Manafort , and campaign adviser ( and Trump son-in-law ) Jared Kushner met at Trump Tower with Natalia Veselnitskaya , a Russian lawyer . Veselnitskaya has represented state-owned businesses , and the Times characterizes her as \u201c a formidable operator with a history of pushing the Kremlin \u2019 s agenda . \u201d\nFive anonymous sources interviewed by the Times , including three White House advisers , say Trump Jr. was specifically told beforehand that the meeting would yield damaging information about Hillary Clinton .\nTrump Jr. \u2019 s newest statement claims that the meeting came about because an \u201c acquaintance \u201d he met in connection with the 2013 Miss Universe pageant ( which was held in Moscow ) asked him to meet with a person who could have \u201c information helpful to the campaign , \u201d and that he was not told in advance whom he \u2019 d be meeting with . The statement also says that Trump Jr. asked Manafort and Kushner to attend the meeting but \u201c told them nothing of the substance . \u201d\nThe account of the president \u2019 s son goes on to state that in the meeting , Veselnitskaya claimed to have \u201c information that individuals connected to Russia were funding the Democratic National Committee and supporting Ms. Clinton , \u201d but that \u201c her statements were vague , ambiguous , and made no sense . \u201d\nThen , he claims , Veselnitskaya began discussing a controversy involving the Magnitsky Act \u2014 a US law attempting to penalize Russian human rights abusers \u2014 and the Russian government \u2019 s subsequent retaliatory decision to ban all US adoption of Russian children . ( Veselnitskaya has lobbied for repeal of the Magnitsky Act for years . )\nTrump Jr. then says he concluded that the promise of \u201c helpful information \u201d was merely a \u201c pretext \u201d to get him in the room to discuss the Magnitsky Act and the adoption controversy . And that , he says , is the end of the story .\nDonald Trump Jr. keeps changing his story about the meeting\nOne of the most suspicious elements of this meeting is that the president \u2019 s son keeps changing his account of it .\nIn March , Donald Jr. told the Times that he \u2019 d never had a meeting with Russians that was set up or in which he was representing the campaign :\nDid I meet with people that were Russian ?
