    "content": "Mitt Romney likes to say he won \u2019 t \u201c apologize \u201d for his success in business . But what he never says is \u201c thank you \u201d \u2013 to the American people \u2013 for the federal bailout of Bain & Company that made so much of his outsize wealth possible .\nAccording to the candidate \u2019 s mythology , Romney took leave of his duties at the private equity firm Bain Capital in 1990 and rode in on a white horse to lead a swift restructuring of Bain & Company , preventing the collapse of the consulting firm where his career began . When The Boston Globe reported on the rescue at the time of his Senate run against Ted Kennedy , campaign aides spun Romney as the wizard behind a \u201c long-shot miracle , \u201d bragging that he had \u201c saved bank depositors all over the country $ 30 million when he saved Bain & Company . \u201d\nIn fact , government documents on the bailout obtained by Rolling Stone show that the legend crafted by Romney is basically a lie . The federal records , obtained under the Freedom of Information Act , reveal that Romney \u2019 s initial rescue attempt at Bain & Company was actually a disaster \u2013 leaving the firm so financially strapped that it had \u201c no value as a going concern. \u201d Even worse , the federal bailout ultimately engineered by Romney screwed the FDIC \u2013 the bank insurance system backed by taxpayers \u2013 out of at least $ 10 million . And in an added insult , Romney rewarded top executives at Bain with hefty bonuses at the very moment that he was demanding his handout from the feds .\nWith his selection of Paul Ryan as his running mate , Romney has made fiscal stewardship the centerpiece of his campaign . A banner at MittRomney.com declared , \u201c We have a moral responsibility not to spend more than we take in. \u201d Romney also opposed the federal bailout for Detroit automakers , famously arguing that the industry should be forced into bankruptcy . Government bailouts , he insists , are \u201c the wrong way to go . \u201d\nBut the FDIC documents on the Bain deal \u2013 which were heavily redacted by the firm prior to release \u2013 show that as a wealthy businessman , Romney was willing to go to extremes to secure a federal bailout to serve his own interests . He had a lot at stake , both financially and politically . Had Bain & Company collapsed , insiders say , it would have dealt a grave setback to Bain Capital , where Romney went on to build a personal fortune valued at as much as $ 250 million . It would also have short-circuited his political career before it began , tagging Romney as a failed businessman unable to rescue his own firm .\n\u201c None of us wanted to see Bain be the laughingstock of the business world , \u201d recalls a longtime Romney lieutenant who asked not to be identified . \u201c But Mitt \u2019 s reputation was on the line . \u201d\nThe trouble began in 1984 , when Bain & Company spun off Bain Capital to engage in leveraged buyouts and put Romney in charge of the new operation . To free up money to invest in the new business , founder Bill Bain and his partners cashed out much of their stock in the consulting firm \u2013 leaving it saddled with about $ 200 million in debt . ( Romney , though not a founder , reportedly profited from the deal . ) \u201c People will tell you that Bill raped the place clean , was greedy , didn \u2019 t know when to stop , \u201d a former Bain consultant later conceded . \u201c Did they take too much out of the firm ? You bet . \u201d\nThe FDIC documents make clear what happened next : \u201c Soon after the founders sold their equity , \u201d analysts reported , \u201c business began to drop off. \u201d First came scandal : In the late 1980s , a Bain consultant became a key figure in an illegal stock manipulation scheme in London . The firm \u2019 s reputation took a hit , and it fired 10 percent of its consulting force . By the time the 1989 recession began , Bain & Company found itself going broke fast . Cash flows weren \u2019 t enough to service the debt imposed by the founders , and the firm could barely make payroll . In a panic , Bill Bain tapped Romney , his longtime prot\u00e9g\u00e9 , to take the reins .\nIn Romney \u2019 s own retelling , he casts himself as a selfless and loyal company man . \u201c There was no upside , \u201d he told his cheerleading biographer Hugh Hewitt in 2007 . \u201c There was no particular reason to do it other than a sense of obligation and duty to an organization that had done great things for me . \u201d\nIn fact , Romney had a direct stake in the survival of Bain & Company : He had been working to build the Bain brand his entire career , and felt he had to save the firm at all costs . After all , Bain sold top-dollar strategic advice to big businesses about how to protect themselves from going bust . If Bain & Company went bankrupt , recalls the Romney deputy , \u201c anyone associated with them would have looked clownish. \u201d Indeed , when a banker from Goldman Sachs urged Bain to consider bankruptcy as the obvious solution to the firm \u2019 s woes , Romney \u2019 s desperation began to show . He flatly refused to discuss it \u2013 and in the ensuing argument , one witness says , Romney almost ended up in a brawl when the Goldman banker advised him to \u201c go fuck yourself. \u201d For the sake of Romney \u2019 s career and fortune , bankruptcy was simply not an option \u2013 no matter who got screwed in the process .\nAccording to the government records obtained by Rolling Stone , Bain & Company \u201c defaulted on its debt obligations \u201d at nearly the same time that \u201c W . Mitt Romney . . . stepped in as managing director ( and later chief executive ) in 1990 and led the financial restructuring intended to get the firm back on track . \u201d\nRomney moved decisively , and his early efforts appeared promising . He persuaded the founders to return $ 25 million of the cash they had raided from Bain & Company and forgive $ 75 million in debt , in return for protection from most future liabilities . Romney then consolidated Bain \u2019 s massive debts into a single , binding loan agreement with four banks , which received liens on Bain \u2019 s assets and agreed to delay repayments on the firm \u2019 s debts for two years . The federal government also signed off on the deal , since the FDIC had recently taken control of a bank that was owed $ 30.6 million by Bain . Romney assured creditors that the restructuring would enable Bain to \u201c operate normally , compensate its professionals competitively \u201d and , ultimately , pay off its debts .\nAlmost as soon as the FDIC agreed to the loan restructuring , however , Romney \u2019 s rescue plan began to fall apart . \u201c The company realized early on that it would be unable to hit its revenue targets or manage the debt structure , \u201d the documents reveal . By the spring of 1992 , Bain \u2019 s decline was perilous : \u201c If Bain goes into default , \u201d one analyst warned the FDIC , \u201c the bank group will need to decide whether to force Bain into bankruptcy . \u201d\nWith his rescue plan a bust , Romney was forced to slink back to the banks to negotiate a new round of debt relief . There was only one catch : Even though Bain & Company was deep in debt and sinking fast , the firm was actually flush with cash \u2013 most of it from the looted money that Bill Bain and other partners had given back . \u201c Liquidity is strong based on the significant cash balance which Bain is carrying , \u201d one federal document reads .\nUnder normal circumstances , such ample reserves would have made liquidating Bain an attractive option : Creditors could simply divvy up the stockpiled cash and be done with the troubled firm . But Bain had inserted a poison pill in its loan agreement with the banks : Instead of being required to use its cash to pay back the firm \u2019 s creditors , the money could be pocketed by Bain executives in the form of fat bonuses \u2013 starting with VPs making $ 200,000 and up . \u201c The company can deplete its cash balances by making officer-bonus payments , \u201d the FDIC lamented , \u201c and still be in compliance with the loan documents . \u201d\nWhat \u2019 s more , the bonus loophole gave Romney a perverse form of leverage : If the banks and the FDIC didn \u2019 t give in to his demands and forgive much of Bain \u2019 s debts , Romney would raid the firm \u2019 s coffers , pushing it into the very bankruptcy that the loan agreement had been intended to avert . The losers in this game would not only be Bain \u2019 s creditors \u2013 including the federal government \u2013 but the firm \u2019 s nearly 1,000 employees worldwide .\nIn March 1992 , according to the FDIC documents , Romney approached the banks and played the bonus card . Allow Bain to pay off its debt at a deep discount , he demanded \u2013 just 35 cents on the dollar . Otherwise , the \u201c majority \u201d of the firm \u2019 s \u201c excess cash \u201d would \u201c be available for the bonus pool to its officers at a vice president level and above . \u201d\nThe next month , when the banks balked at the deal , Romney decided to prove he wasn \u2019 t bluffing . \u201c As the bank group did not accept the proposal from Bain , \u201d the records show , \u201c Bain \u2019 s senior management has decided to go forth with the distribution of bonuses. \u201d ( Bain \u2019 s lawyers redacted the amount of the executive payouts , and the Romney campaign refused to comment on whether Romney himself received a bonus . )\nRomney \u2019 s decision to place executive compensation over fiscal responsibility immediately put Bain on the ropes . By that July , FDIC analysts reported , Bain had so little money left that \u201c the company will actually run out of cash and default on the existing debt structure \u201d as early as 1995 . If that happened , Bain employees and American consumers would take the hit \u2013 an alternative that analysts considered \u201c catastrophic . \u201d\nBut Romney didn \u2019 t dole out all of Bain \u2019 s cash as bonuses right away . According to a record from May 1992 , he set aside some of the money to put one last squeeze on the firm \u2019 s creditors . Romney now demanded that the banks and the government agree to a deal that was even less favorable than the last \u2013 to retire Bain \u2019 s debts \u201c at a price up to but not exceeding 30 cents on the dollar . \u201d\nThe FDIC considered finding a buyer to take over its loans to Bain , but analysts concluded that \u201c Bain has no value as a going concern. \u201d And the government wasn \u2019 t likely to get much out of Bain if it allowed the firm to go bankrupt : The loan agreement engineered by Romney had left the FDIC \u201c virtually unsecured \u201d on the $ 30.6 million it was owed by Bain . \u201c Once bonuses are paid , \u201d the analysts warned , \u201c all members of the bank group believe this company will dissolve during 1993 . \u201d\nAbout the only assets left would be Bain \u2019 s office equipment . The records show FDIC analysts pathetically attempting to assess the value of such items , including an HP LaserJet printer , before concluding that most of the gear was so old that the government \u2019 s \u201c portion of any liquidation proceeds would be negligible . \u201d\nHow had Romney scored such a favorable deal at the FDIC \u2019 s expense ? It didn \u2019 t hurt that he had close ties to the agency \u2013 the kind of \u201c crony capitalism \u201d he now decries . A month before he closed the 1991 loan agreement , Romney promoted a former FDIC bank examiner to become a senior executive at Bain . He also had pull at the top : FDIC chairman Bill Seidman , who had served as finance chair for Romney \u2019 s father when he ran for president in 1968 .\nThe federal documents also reveal that , contrary to Romney \u2019 s claim that he returned full time to Bain Capital in 1992 , he remained involved in bailout negotiations to the very end . In a letter dated March 23rd , 1993 , Romney reassured creditors that his latest scheme would return Bain & Company to \u201c long-term financial stability. \u201d That same month , Romney once again threatened to \u201c pay out maximum bonus distributions \u201d to top executives unless much of Bain \u2019 s debt was erased .\nIn the end , the government surrendered . At the time , The Boston Globe cited bankers dismissing the bailout as \u201c relatively routine \u201d \u2013 but the federal documents reveal it was anything but . The FDIC agreed to accept nearly $ 5 million in cash to retire $ 15 million in Bain \u2019 s debt \u2013 an immediate government bailout of $ 10 million . All told , the FDIC estimated it would recoup just $ 14 million of the $ 30 million that Romney \u2019 s firm owed the government .\nIt was a raw deal \u2013 but Romney \u2019 s threat to loot his own firm had left the government with no other choice . If the FDIC had pushed Bain into bankruptcy , the records reveal , the agency would have recouped just $ 3.56 million from the firm .\nThe Romney campaign refused to respond to questions for this article ; a spokeswoman said only that \u201c Mitt Romney turned around Bain & Company by getting all parties to come to the table and make difficult decisions. \u201d But while taxpayers did not finance the bailout , the debt forgiven by the government was booked as a loss to the FDIC \u2013 and then recouped through higher insurance premiums from banks . And banks , of course , are notorious for finding ways to pass their costs along to customers , usually in the form of higher fees . Thanks to the nature of the market , in other words , the bailout negotiated by Romney ultimately wound up being paid by the American people .\nEven as consumers took a loss , however , a small group of investors wound up getting a good deal in the bailout . Bain Capital \u2013 the very firm that had triggered the crisis in the first place \u2013 walked away with $ 4 million . That was the fee it charged Bain & Company for loaning the consulting firm the services of its chief executive \u2013 one Willard Mitt Romney .\nThis story is from the September 13 , 2012 issue of Rolling Stone .\n\u2022 Greed and Debt : The True Story of Mitt Romney and Bain Capital\n\u2022 How the GOP Became the Party of the Rich",
