Although he clearly believes it \u2019 s a bad idea to indict a sitting president , Kavanaugh never states his view whether the Constitution allows it . In fact , he says Congress should pass legislation to ensure the president is immune from civil and criminal proceedings while in office . As Feldman writes , Kavanaugh \u2019 s 2009 article can be read as a signal that he might uphold a presidential indictment unless Congress changes the law . We don \u2019 t mean to split hairs by analyzing whether Kavanaugh believes something \u201c can \u2019 t \u201d or \u201c shouldn \u2019 t \u201d happen , but in the legal arena , this distinction matters . Kavanaugh \u2019 s stated views on this question don \u2019 t go as far as Fallon , Maloney and Ocasio-Cortez claimed . Their tweets merit Two Pinocchios , although we considered giving Three . To say Kavanaugh is Trump \u2019 s \u201c get-out-of-jail free card \u201d is an extreme distortion of what he \u2019 s written .\n? ? Says sitting POTUS ca n't be indicted/can fire special counsel whenever he wants\n? ? Says assault weapon bans are unconstitutional \u2014 Brian Fallon ( @ brianefallon ) July 10 , 2018\nAside from the 'extreme distortion ' on point three , the rest of Fallon 's `` indictment '' sounds pretty good , does n't it ?",
