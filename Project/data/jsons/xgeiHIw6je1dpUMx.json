Mixed in with the regular detritus of the school day , the crumpled sweatshirts and food wrappers , was a blatantly inappropriate Thanksgiving-themed worksheet .\nOn the top of the page : a smiling cartoon Native American with his arm around a giant piece of corn . Below , a word scramble featuring Thanksgiving-themed vocabulary words . Her son had successfully reassembled `` inIdan '' to `` Indian . ''\n`` I literally gasped . I had assumed they had an updated curriculum about Thanksgiving , '' she said , explaining that she thought educators had moved beyond the fairy tale version of the holiday she learned three decades ago . You know , the one about togetherness and bounty that conveniently leaves out the part of the story in which Native Americans were systematically murdered and oppressed and replaces it with a second helping of pie .\nThe incident left Gilbert , like many non-indigenous parents today , questioning how to celebrate Thanksgiving with her children . Indigenous families have been wrestling with , and resisting , the myth of Thanksgiving for as long as it has been around . Today , some Native Americans celebrate the holiday , often connecting it to their culture 's traditions of Thanksgiving , while others consider it a day of mourning .\nAs our country reckons with the persistent racism and cultural insensitivity that has , for so , so , long , been hiding in plain sight , yesterday 's model of Thanksgiving no longer cuts it . It 's time to figure out what 's next .\n`` We are Americans , we can make the holiday into anything we want it to be . We can choose to celebrate each other , '' said Rep. Deb Haaland of New Mexico . In 2018 , she became one of the first Native American women elected to Congress .\nThe first step is to take a red pen to the insensitive myths and practices surrounding Thanksgiving , particularly as it is taught to young children . Curricula for the holiday vary wildly across the country , and some children might simply be learning about gratitude , some about the oppression of indigenous people , and , still , some might be encouraged to dress up like Pilgrims and Indians to recreate the romanticized first Thanksgiving that never was .\n`` We 've advanced this fictional narrative and used Thanksgiving to create a national story that is not true , '' said Maureen Costello , director of Teaching Tolerance , a project of the Southern Poverty Law Center , which has a great resource sheet on Thanksgiving\nHolidays evolve over time . Christmas did n't always have Santa Claus . Easter did n't always have a bunny . Likewise , Thanksgiving was n't always about joyful communion between English colonizers and Native Americans \u2014 a joyful communion that is about as steeped in facts as a bearded man delivering presents via a chimney . `` It is time to drop this historical fiction . ''\nThe practice of dressing up like Native Americans , or engaging with any media that presents indigenous people as cartoonish historical relics , however well-intentioned , is also a bad idea . When children learn about Native Americans this way , it has a number of negative consequences , Costello explains .\nFor one , the cutesy , Disneyfied version of the holiday subtly teaches children that Native Americans are a thing of the past . They become more once-upon-a-time , than the neighbors and fellow citizens they are and who , in many cases , are still fighting for equal rights and fair treatment . It also deceptively smooths out a history that should be taught with all its rough edges .\n`` In a perfect world , I would return Thanksgiving to a harvest festival , '' Costello said . `` But in the real world , we have this [ inaccurate ] story out there , so parents and teachers need to tell the truth . '' She said that if children have had no exposure to the Thanksgiving myth , then parents might consider framing the holiday as a time of gratitude , saving the history lesson for another time .\nBut considering how ubiquitous the myth still is , odds are that most adults will have some explaining to do .\nGratitude is what Haaland focuses on during Thanksgiving at her home . `` We do n't celebrate it because we think the first colonizers had a great dinner with Indians . We do it because it is a time to give thanks to our family and think about how we all have something to be grateful for . Personally , I think a lot about my grandparents and what they did to protect our culture and traditions for us . ''\nThis is on Haaland 's mind a lot these days as she sees a resurgence of activism surrounding sacred sites , and a rise of elected officials from of Indigenous descent . All this makes it easier for all of us to see how `` Native American history is American history , '' she said . Today , anyone with an Internet connection and a bit of curiosity can get a better understanding of the past and how its patterns and themes continue to play out today .\nTai Simpson , a member of Nimiipuu nation ( Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho ) and community organizer for Indigenous Idaho Alliance , does not personally celebrate Thanksgiving , but is not opposed to others observing the holiday . The key , as she sees it , is making it relevant .\n`` You can celebrate with your families , but understand that lots of sacrifices were made for this country , and the descendants of those who made these sacrifices are still around , '' she said .\nWhen Simpson teaches the holiday in schools , she emphasizes its current manifestations . What is the reality for Native Americans today ? How did we get there ? `` Young people can handle it . They can navigate hard questions , and learn history in a way that is thoroughly honest . ''\nFor small children , this might begin with a recognition that British colonists were not good sharers . As kids mature , so should the content . Also , such discussions could include learning more about the history and culture of local Native American tribe or tribes , if there is one or more nearby .\nAs for families with indigenous roots , she suggests they consider reconnecting with their culture on Thanksgiving . Some tribes have pow-wows on the holiday which `` helps with healing and community building . '' Others take the days off to teach children their native languages , revisit their creation stories , and overall connect with their culture . `` It 's a chance to look at what our people used to do and think , ' I can do this now . ' ''\nReckoning with a checkered past might be challenging , but it 's also essential for our current demographic reality , said Anton Treuer , professor of Ojibwe at Bemidji State University and author of `` Everything You Wanted to Know About Indians But Were Afraid to Ask . ''\n`` White Americans have developed ways of interacting with Thanksgiving that revolves around white comfort , rather than the needs of kids of all races , '' he said . `` But now , with the majority of K-12 students being students of color , figuring out how to get along with people who are not the same as you , and understand people who are not the same as you , is vital . ''\nUnderstanding another culture 's history and current status is a big part of this , as is appreciating the wisdom and grace in their cultures . Treuer suggests starting with honoring the fact that many of the foods we eat on Thanksgiving , including turkey , cranberries and potatoes , came from Native American cultures .\nAlso , worthy of every single person 's attention is the tradition of respect for the natural world and the ways in which it provides for us , found in Native American cultures . This is a lesson we should have learned a long time ago , before systematically destroying our planet .\nLastly , we can think of our responsibility to one another , another important value among Native American communities , and how we can make the things we are grateful for , be it food or company , available to those who do n't have it .\nTreuer says at his family 's Thanksgiving , they mix all these feelings and ideas , and more .\n`` We get together .
