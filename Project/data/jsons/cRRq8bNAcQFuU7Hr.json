Not just in the sense that we are all fallible human beings who probably say things that aren \u2019 t true sometimes \u2014 he has made flagrant disregard for the truth a hallmark of his approach to business and politics .\nHe wrote about his strategic use of dishonesty in The Art of The Deal . He admitted to routinely lying about important matters in a sworn deposition . And of course it \u2019 s obvious to anyone who \u2019 s followed his political career that he has continued to exhibit a flagrant disregard for the truth as he pivoted from real estate developer to celebrity brand licenser to president . A core belief of his is that lying is a good way to get ahead , which is why he lies so much .\nIn addition to being a liar , Trump is unusually ill-informed about public policy for a president , so he plausibly says some things that are n't true out of genuine lack of knowledge . This leads to a natural caution on the part of some journalists who cover the White House about calling a lie a lie , with phrases like \u201c demonstrable falsehood \u201d instead .\nTrump told two demonstrable falsehoods this AM , one about his administration \u2019 s policy of separating undocumented immigrant kids inclu infants from their parents , which he tried to claim wasn \u2019 t his own policy . The other was falsely claiming his own aide didn \u2019 t give a bg briefing . \u2014 Maggie Haberman ( @ maggieNYT ) May 26 , 2018\nEven in a news analysis piece about Trump \u2019 s strategic promotion of conspiracy theories , the New York Times euphemistically referred to \u201c unconfirmed accusations \u201d rather than baseless conspiracy theories .\nThis preference for euphemism over straightforward language is silly , so it \u2019 s attracted considerable social media criticism . New York Times journalists , meanwhile , are fiercely loyal to one another in public . The institution is congenitally unwilling to accept any form of criticism . And so Times reporters have responded as they often do , not by engaging on the substance of the criticism but by questioning the critics \u2019 motives .\nI think there 's an expectation from some Trump opponents that the press ought to be their proxy and to engage as political actors . ( Many conservatives believe we already do , I realize , and of course Trump has explicitly framed the situation this way . ) \u2014 Nick Confessore ( @ nickconfessore ) May 27 , 2018\nThe good news is that euphemisms are not nearly so harmful as their critics fear . The thing that Trump does is lie , and whether we call the lies \u201c lies \u201d or \u201c demonstrable falsehoods \u201d is ultimately not that important either politically or journalistically .\nThe bad news is the fact that Donald Trump is a liar remains incredibly important and yet poorly integrated into ongoing coverage of his administration . Every politician I can think of has , at some point , said something that isn \u2019 t true . But almost all of them seem to mostly adhere to at least defensible interpretations of the facts . They do so to avoid obtaining a reputation for dishonesty , in part because they fear that obtaining a reputation for dishonesty would hurt their future efforts at communication .\nTrump , thus far , has avoided this penalty . He says untrue things . The falseness of his statements is revealed and reported on . And then his future pronouncements are nonetheless treated as deserving the same presumption of truth that we grant to normal people .\nThat \u2019 s a big mistake . Presidents naturally end up making representations about things where the facts are not fully knowable to the public . When Trump does that , we need , as a country , to remember that our president is a huge liar .\nGenerally speaking , for a statement to be a lie , it needs to be false and it needs to be something that the speaker knows to be false . That distinguishes it from a wide range of other kinds of false statements that people make :\n\u201c The Cavaliers have a shot against the Warriors in this year \u2019 s NBA finals \u201d is false , but the sentiment is probably wishful thinking rather than a deliberate effort to mislead .\n\u201c Michael Jordan was a better basketball player than LeBron James \u201d is ridiculous and flies in the face of the evidence , but appears to be sincerely believed in good faith by a large number of people whose minds have been ravaged by nostalgia .\n\u201c Michael Jordan won the most championships of any player in NBA history \u201d is not just provably false ( he \u2019 s in a four-way tie for 10th ) but is a piece of misinformation a casual basketball fan might have picked up from overhearing arguments about how Jordan \u2019 s six championships ( to just three for James ) make him the greater player .\nThis last one is a \u201c demonstrable falsehood , \u201d though to know whether or not it \u2019 s a lie , you would have to know , subjectively , what the person saying it knows . Since this is impossible in most cases , it serves as an argument for journalists to avoid the ascription of knowledge and intent inherent in the word \u201c lie . \u201d\nBut while this is true on a case-by-case basis , we really can know that Trump lies deliberately because he says so himself .\n\u201c A little hyperbole never hurts , \u201d Trump writes in his first book , The Art of the Deal . \u201d People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular . I call it truthful hyperbole . It \u2019 s an innocent form of exaggeration \u2014 and a very effective form of promotion . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s a theme he returns to in his most recent book , Crippled America , where he asks , \u201c When was the last time you saw a sign hanging outside a pizzeria claiming \u2018 The fourth best pizza in the world ? \u201d\nBeyond simple hyperbole , The Art of the Deal also explains in some detail a fraud Trump ran in 1982 to get the Holiday Inn corporation to go in as his partner on his first Atlantic City casino . Before the board would approve the deal , they wanted to see the site . Trump was worried he \u2019 d get turned down because so little progress had been made , so he asked his construction crew to round up \u201c every bulldozer and dump truck he could possibly find \u201d and literally pretend to work for as long as the board was on site :\nI wanted him to transform my two acres of nearly vacant property into the most active construction site in the history of the world . What the bulldozers and dump trucks did wasn \u2019 t important , I said , so long as they did a lot of it . If they got some actual work accomplished , all the better , but if necessary he should have the bulldozers dig up dirt from one side of the site and dump it on the other .\nIn Trump \u2019 s eyes , it worked . \u201c The board walked away from the site absolutely convinced it was the perfect choice , \u201d he writes . \u201c In reality , I wasn \u2019 t that far along , but I did everything I could , short of going to work at the site myself , to assure them that my casino was practically finished . My leverage came from confirming an impression they were already predisposed to believe . \u201d\nTrump , in short , lied for personal gain and not only isn \u2019 t ashamed of it but actually bragged about it repeatedly in books . During depositions taken as part of a 2007 libel lawsuit against Trump biographer Tim O \u2019 Brien , Trump admitted to lying publicly more than 30 times in order to avoid lying under oath and perjuring himself .\nIn other words , while it \u2019 s hard to know the mental state behind any particular untrue thing Trump says , it \u2019 s easy to know that Trump is a person who knows the difference between telling the truth and lying . He knows how to tell the truth when it suits him but frequently prefers to lie .\nThese days , the term \u201c ethnic cleansing \u201d is uniformly understood to be a synonym for genocide . But it originated as a euphemism , deliberately deployed by its proponents to try to muddy the waters . Way back in a 1982 article about the early stirrings of ethnic unrest in then-Yugoslavia , the New York Times quoted Becir Hoti , executive secretary of the Communist Party of Kosovo , as saying \u201c The nationalists have a two-point platform : first to establish what they call an ethnically clean Albanian republic and then the merger with Albania to form a greater Albania . \u2019 \u2019\nThe concept was later picked up by Serbian nationalists and circulated widely in the Western press , and since it was associated with horrifying atrocities , has now become a phrase that means horrifying atrocities rather than a euphemism .\nBy the same token , if we all start calling the thing Trump does \u201c demonstrable falsehoods \u201d or \u201c unconfirmed accusations , \u201d then those phrases will simply start to pick up some of the current condemnatory meaning of \u201c lie. \u201d It would probably be simpler to just cut to the chase and call a lie a lie , but it \u2019 s also probably immaterial in the long run .\nThe important thing about Trump \u2019 s habit of lying isn \u2019 t that we use the word lie ; it \u2019 s that we remember that he is a liar the next time he goes and says something . After all , presidents say things all the time that outsiders can not immediately verify or debunk . Most presidents , through their habit of mostly not lying , earn the right to the benefit of the doubt in such cases . Trump , with his habit of constantly offering demonstrable falsehoods , has earned the opposite .\nThe economist and occasional political commentator Daniel Davies once memorably wrote that \u201c fibbers \u2019 forecasts are worthless , \u201d citing it as an example of a simple business school lesson with ample application to politics .\n\u201c If you have doubts about the integrity of a forecaster , \u201d he wrote , \u201c you can \u2019 t use their forecasts at all . Not even as a \u2018 starting point . \u2019 \u201d\nTrump frequently makes representations about things where it \u2019 s simply not possible to immediately know for sure whether he \u2019 s telling the truth , typically because they refer to his private plans or activities . As president , for example , Trump has said that he would develop a plan to provide every American with health insurance , that the North Korean government had agreed to denuclearize , that he would promote a \u201c bill of love \u201d to help DREAMers , that he would take on the National Rifle Association to reduce school shootings , and that he would develop a tax plan that rich people would not benefit \u201c at all \u201d from .\nNone of this was true . Critically , none of it was demonstrably false at the time Trump said it . But equally critically , a reasonable person would have known better than to believe in any of it because Trump lies all the time .\nYet the troubling thing about media coverage of Trump isn \u2019 t that the press has failed to label lies as lies once they are proven to be lies . It \u2019 s that these kinds of statements continue to be taken at face value when they are made , as if they were offered by a normal , reasonably honest person .
