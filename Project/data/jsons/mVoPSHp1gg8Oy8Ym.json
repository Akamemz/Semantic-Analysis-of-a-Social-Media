    "content": "More than 100,000 convicted felons or other \u201c prohibited persons \u201d tried to buy guns each year during President Barack Obama \u2019 s administration by lying on their applications , but the Justice Department only considered prosecuting about 30 to 40 people each year , according to a Daily Caller News Foundation investigation .\nThe Obama administration may have publicly aligned itself with anti-gun activists , but it consistently turned a blind eye to prosecute known criminals who tried to buy guns .\nA June 2016 Justice Department Inspector General \u2019 s report revealed that between 2008 and 2015 the U.S . Attorneys office considered prosecuting \u201c less than 32 people per year \u201d for lying on form 4473 , the federal application to buy guns .\nSurprisingly , the Obama administration \u2019 s harshest critics are gun manufacturers themselves .\n\u201c People could do what is called , \u2018 lie and buy , ' \u201d explained Lawrence Keane , a senior vice president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation , a nonprofit organization that represents gun manufacturers .\n\u201c But very infrequently is anyone ever prosecuted . What \u2019 s the point of making it a crime if you don \u2019 t enforce it ? \u201d he asked in an interview with TheDCNF .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a long-standing problem . And it was certainly true over the last eight years where the Department of Justice did not prosecute people , \u201d he complained .\nDaniel D. Roberts , who in 2009 was named Assistant Director of the FBI \u2019 s Criminal Justice Information Services Division , confirmed that more than 100,000 criminals each year attempt to buy guns even though they have rap sheets .\n\u201c When I was there , it was running around 100,000 a year of firearm purchasers that tried to go through to buy guns . I think it \u2019 s more than 100,000 now , \u201d he told TheDCNF in an interview . \u201c That should trigger a referral to the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) for investigation for lying on the forms . \u201d\nTwo of every 10 gun denials referred to the ATF was sent to field offices for prosecution , a Justice Department report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in 2013 and 2014 found . Eight of ten never faced prosecution , according to the report .\nRoberts ran the FBI \u2019 s National Instant Criminal Background Check System ( NICS ) checks , that is the main tool the bureau uses to conduct background checks of potential buyers of guns . He left the bureau only last year .\nDave Workman , a senior editor of the Gunmag.com , a publication owned by the pro-gun rights Second Amendment Foundation , claims the Obama administration simply didn \u2019 t want to spend the money to prosecute people who lied on their form 4473 .\n\u201c The Justice Department didn \u2019 t want to spend the money or interest or time to prosecute the key people who lied on their 4473 , \u201d he told TheDCNF in an interview .\nThe Inspector General \u2019 s report bears out Workman \u2019 s observation , stating prosecuting those who lied on their applications was \u201c not the best use of Department resources . \u201d\nProsecutors \u201c hold the view that prosecuting subjects for false statements on a firearm application absent other aggravating circumstances may not be the best use of Department resources , \u201d The Executive Office of U.S. Attorney said .\nKeane said , however , the decision eliminated a deterrent effect . \u201c It has a deterrent effect to others that there are consequences engaging in that conduct , \u201d he told TheDCNF .\nThe Justice Department \u2019 s passivity seemed to go against the Obama administration \u2019 s public image of being tough on those who lied to buy guns , Workman added .\n\u201c It was unusual for an administration that was so ideological on gun control to not go after these guys when they essentially had been caught red-handed , \u201d he said . \u201c That I find a little bit disturbing . \u201d\nEven the pro-gun control advocacy group \u201c Everytown For Gun Safety \u201d lamented the lack of Obama prosecutions .\n\u201c It is a federal crime for felons and other prohibited gun purchasers to attempt to buy a gun . The ( U.S. ) Department of Justice , however , has not been prosecuting people who fail background checks at licensed gun dealers , \u201d the group stated on its website .\nSimilarly , Avery Gardiner , the co-president of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence told TheDCNF those who lie on their background check applications should be prosecuted .\n\u201c They \u2019 re subverting decades-old federal law that keeps guns out of the hands of dangerous people , \u201d he told TheDCNF in an email .\n\u201c At Brady , we \u2019 d like to see the Department of Justice encourage its prosecutors to pursue these criminal acts , \u201d Gardiner said .\nGun control activists may also be surprised that the denial rate for gun applications plummeted during the Obama administration , from 17.2 denials per thousand in 1999 to only 5.5 denials per thousand in 2014 , according to a June 2016 Justice Department report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics .\nUnder federal law there are ten categories of \u201c prohibited persons \u201d who are specifically barred from ever purchasing a gun , according to the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms .\nProhibited persons include convicted felons , drug addicts , those committed to a mental institution , people dishonorably discharged , someone who has a restraining order or an individual who has stalked people or have been convicted of domestic violence against women .\nThe issue isn \u2019 t an academic one . Devin Patrick Kelley , 26 , opened fire on parishioners at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs , Texas , Nov. 5 , and killed 26 people and wounded 20 others . Kelley met at least three specific conditions that should have denied him a gun .\nKelley in 2012 fled the Peak Behavioral Health Services hospital in New Mexico where he was sent for a serious mental illness condition after being court-martialed by the Air Force on charges of assaulting his wife and child . Kelley also stalked two teenage girls . Finally , he pled guilty to the charges , spent a year in military prison , and was given a bad conduct discharge .\nYet , he presumably withheld all of this information on his gun application . He was able to buy four guns between 2013 to 2017 in Colorado Springs , Colo. , and San Antonio , Texas .\nA scathing September 2016 Justice Department Inspector General \u2019 s report found prosecutions of criminals who sought guns under the Obama administration were \u201c extremely low . \u201d\nAfter the Sandy Hook elementary school killing , Obama issued a report in January 2013 titled \u201c Now is the Time : The President \u2019 s Plan to Protect our Children and our Communities by Reducing Gun Violence . \u201d\n\u201c The Attorney General would ask U.S . Attorneys to consider whether additional efforts would be appropriate in areas such as the prosecution of felons who illegally seek to obtain a firearm , and persons who attempt to evade the NICS system by providing false information , \u201d one part of the plan stated .\nBut the Inspector General \u2019 s Office found that \u201c there was no significant change in the number of NICS cases pursued for prosecution [ after ] the President \u2019 s January 2013 plan to reduce gun violence . \u201d\nThe number of prosecutions \u201c remained extremely low \u201d since former Attorney General Eric Holder unveiled his \u201c Smart on Crime \u201d initiative in August 2013 , the report found .\n\u201c Significant number of prosecutions remained extremely low , \u201d the Inspector General \u2019 s Office concluded .\nProhibited people who lie on their gun applications or actually obtain guns under false pretenses are routinely referred to the Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms agency . ATF prosecutions dropped precipitously under the Obama administration .\n\u201c The percentage of cases referred by ATF that were accepted for consideration of prosecution also has decreased , \u201d according to the report .\nU.S . Attorneys \u201c accepted 80 percent of ATF field division referrals for consideration of prosecution in calendar years 2002 and 2003 , 60 percent in FY 2008 , and 38 percent in FY 2013 , \u201d the report added .\n\u201c The system we have is broken and needs to be fixed .
