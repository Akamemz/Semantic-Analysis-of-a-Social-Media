    "content": "Once A Fence , Later Slats , Almost Always A Wall : Trump 's Border Wall Contradictions\nPoliticians often have to change course when their campaign promises run up against reality . But when President Trump ran for office , and throughout his presidency , an explicit part of his pitch was that he was n't like all the other politicians . Trump 's `` great wall '' was a big concrete symbol of that .\nExcept that now it is n't even concrete . In recent weeks , he has been saying it will be made of `` beautiful '' steel slats . The way Trump has described the wall has changed a lot over time , to the point of contradiction . That includes how the wall will be paid for .\nThe president is now in a battle with congressional Democrats to approve $ 5.7 billion in funding for a physical barrier , placing the wall at the center of a lengthy government shutdown that Trump is struggling to find his way out of .\nIn April 2014 , when businessman Donald Trump was toying with running for president , he told an audience in New Hampshire that he would `` build a border fence like you have never seen before . ''\nThat summer , a couple of Trump 's advisers came up with the idea of calling it a `` wall '' as a way of signaling Trump would be an immigration hard-liner .\n`` And what better way than to have his brand incorporated by Donald Trump saying , 'Yeah , I 'm going to build a wall . Nobody builds like Trump ' ? '' said former Trump adviser Sam Nunberg .\nThe advisers wanted to ensure that every time he gave one of his wide-ranging , largely unscripted speeches , Trump would hit the theme of being tough on immigration . `` Build the wall '' \u2014 like `` Make America Great Again '' \u2014 was easy to remember and would fit well in the `` Trump variety show , '' as Nunberg described Trump 's rally speeches .\n`` It was fun . It was cool . It was novel , '' said Nunberg .\nNunberg wants to be clear : Trump rejected plenty of their ideas . But he went all-in on the wall .\nIn August 2014 , Trump sent his first tweet about building a wall . Fittingly , it was in all caps .\nA few months later , he tweeted again , adding a little more detail . The wall would be `` massive , '' and the funding would come , indirectly , from Mexico .\nTrump officially launched his campaign in June 2015 , with the wall as a centerpiece .\n`` I would build a great wall , and nobody builds walls better than me , believe me , and I 'll build them very inexpensively , '' Trump said in the gilded Trump Tower in New York . `` I will build a great , great wall on our Southern border .
