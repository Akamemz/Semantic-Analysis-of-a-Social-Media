And that means we get to watch many of our politicians give commencement speeches.\n\n\n\nThese days, the ritual often comes with controversy. Speakers get boycotted; conservatives complain that their views are underrepresented. This year has been somewhat quieter than usual. Campus Reform, a right-wing website that tracks commencement speakers for political bias, found that at the 50 largest public and private four-year colleges, 15 speakers were liberal and 11 conservative, while 24 were non-political.\n\n\n\nOf course, most speeches, even from politicians, tend to consist largely of urging graduates not to be afraid to fail, or reminding them of the importance of having a goal larger than themselves. Still, some pointed lines crept in.\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump told Air Force cadets in Colorado Springs that their time at the academy had prepared them \u201cto win, win, win.\u201d \u201cOur country is respected again,\u201d the president said. \u201cWe\u2019re reawakening American pride, American confidence, and American greatness.\u201d\n\n\n\nSpeaking to Hunter College grads in New York, Hillary Clinton criticized President Trump for failing to condemn Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. \u201cThere may not be tanks in our streets \u2013 but make no mistake, we are witnessing an assault on the rule of law and the foundations of our democracy,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nOne of the most revealing speeches may have come from the man who first appointed Robert Mueller to investigate possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia.
