    "content": "President Donald Trump injected fresh drama into an already tense meeting of the Group of Seven major industrialized nations Friday , calling for Russia , ousted for its the annexation of Crimea , to be reinstated .\nTrump made the comment at the White House Friday after hours of further escalating his rhetoric against longtime allies over U.S. trade practices .\n`` Why are we having a meeting without Russia in the meeting ? Trump said . `` They should let Russia come back in because we should have Russia at the negotiating table . ''\nSolidifying his solo status on the world stage , Trump also lashed out at longtime allies over their criticism of his trade policies and plans an early exit from the G-7 meeting .\nRussia was ousted from the elite group in 2014 as punishment for President Vladimir Putin 's annexation of Crimea and its support for pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine . In the U.S. , special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating whether Trump 's campaign colluded with Russia in a bid to sway the 2016 presidential election in his favor .\nTrump will arrive Friday at the annual gathering , held this year at a Quebec resort , but will leave Saturday morning before the event is over , heading to Singapore for his highly anticipated summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un . The White House announced his travel plans after French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signaled they would use the G7 event to take a stance against new U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports .\n`` Looking forward to straightening out unfair Trade Deals with the G-7 countries , '' Trump tweeted early Friday . `` If it does n't happen , we come out even better . ''\nTrump also singled out tariffs on U.S. dairy products in yet another scathing tweet directed at Canada just before the G-7 .\nAt a joint press conference on Thursday , Macron said : `` A trade war does n't spare anyone . It will start first of all to hurt U.S . workers . '' Trudeau said : `` We are going to defend our industries and our workers . ''\nTrudeau , for his part , said Trump 's action would hurt American workers as well as Canadians .\n`` If I can get the president to actually realize that what he 's doing is counterproductive for his own goals as well , perhaps we can move forward in a smarter way , '' Trudeau said .\nAs tempers frayed , Trump had a ready retort , via tweet : `` Please tell Prime Minister Trudeau and President Macron that they are charging the U.S. massive tariffs and create non-monetary barriers . The EU trade surplus with the U.S. is $ 151 Billion , and Canada keeps our farmers and others out . Look forward to seeing them tomorrow . ''\nLater Thursday , Trump tweeted : `` Prime Minister Trudeau is being so indignant , bringing up the relationship that the U.S. and Canada had over the many years and all sorts of other things ... but he does n't bring up the fact that they charge us up to 300 % on dairy \u2014 hurting our Farmers , killing our Agriculture ! ''\nA few hours later , he added , `` Take down your tariffs & barriers or we will more than match you ! ''\nWith a cool reception all but assured , Trump has complained to aides about even having to attend the meeting , especially since his summit with Kim is just days away . Late Thursday , the White House announced that Trump would be leaving the G-7 late Saturday morning to head to Singapore ahead of his summit with Kim , though the G-7 meeting was scheduled to last until later that day .\nTrump will skip out on G-7 meetings about climate change , clean energy and ocean protection .\nThis marks Trump 's second summit of the G-7 , an informal gathering that meets every year under a rotating chairmanship . The member countries are Canada , France , Italy , Japan , Germany , the United States and Britain . The European Union also attends . Trump is set to hold a series of group and one-on-one meetings , including with Trudeau and Macron .\nUnder Trump , the United States has abandoned its traditional role in the G-7 . His predecessors pressed for freer global trade and championed a trading system that required countries to follow World Trade Organization rules . Trump 's policies have been more protectionist and confrontational , driven by a perception that the U.S. has been the victim of poorly conceived trade deals .\nRelations have hit such a low that a key question now is whether the seven countries can agree on a joint statement of priorities at the conclusion of the meeting . A gathering of G-7 finance ministers days earlier concluded last week with a message of `` concern and disappointment '' for Trump from the other six countries . France 's finance minister described the group as `` far more a G-6 plus one than a G-7 . ''\nMacron made clear Thursday that the other six countries would n't hesitate to go it alone . On Twitter , he said : `` The American President may not mind being isolated , but neither do we mind signing a 6 country agreement if need be . ''\nTrump 's top economic adviser , Larry Kudlow , was vague Wednesday on the outcome of the summit , saying : `` For these kind of decisions , let them meet first . Let them meet ; let them discuss . And then we 'll see what happens . ''\nTension has been building over a year of policymaking that has distanced the U.S. from traditional allies , including by Trump 's decisions to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear agreement . The new tariffs \u2014 25 percent on imported steel , 10 percent on aluminum from Canada , Mexico and the European Union \u2014 threaten to drive up prices for American consumers and companies and heighten uncertainty for businesses and investors around the globe .\nCanada and other U.S. allies are retaliating with tariffs on U.S. exports .
