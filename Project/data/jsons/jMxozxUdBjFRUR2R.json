The opinions expressed in this commentary are his .\n( CNN ) Anyone hoping that the Paris attacks will somehow transform the fight against global jihad and produce a quick and definitive defeat for the bad guys and victory for the good ought to take a deep breath .\nWe must take advantage of the Paris carnage to mobilize international and regional allies in the fight ; but we should have no illusions it will produce quick or even lasting victories .\nEven if the Paris attacks turn out to be transformative event ; they 're likely to represent another turn in the very long war against global jihad . Here are six reasons why .\n\u2022 It 's a long war because 15 years after 9/11 and decades after Islamic suicide terror made its Middle Eastern debut in Lebanon with Hezbollah attacks against U.S. Marines and embassies , we 're still fighting it . The dismantling of al Qaeda central and the killing of Osama bin Laden has n't ended the threat ; it has morphed and evolved into other groups such as ISIS , Khorasan and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula .\n\u2022 It 's the long war because as necessary and vital as military airstrikes are , they ca n't provide the definitive answer to the problem . Indeed , 9/11 resulted in the two longest wars in American history and partly helped to create the situation we face today . Massive airstrikes and deployment of thousands of ground forces without securing an end state that ensures coherent and stable governance will not address the underlying conditions on which the jihadis feed . In fact , the budding grand alliance ( France , the U.S. and Russia ) will be perceived by radical Muslims as a war between the Christian West and Islam and will only feed jihadi propaganda and even boost recruitment .\n\u2022 It 's a long war because key Arab states are melting down . In Libya , Yemen , Syria and Iraq there is neither good , stable nor coherent governance . Instead , you have large and empty and ungovernable spaces ; sectarian tensions between Sunnis and Shia empowering transnational actors willing and able to fill the vacuum . Even in a country like Egypt , we now see a home-grown insurgency affiliated with the Islamic State that has already destroyed a Russian commercial airliner . Even if the Syrian civil war ended , the jihadi insurgency would continue feeding on local grievances ; Indeed , paradoxically you might see a surge of foreign fighters flocking to Egypt to continue the struggle .\nIt 's the long war because the West can not win the fight against radical Islam until the Muslim majority begins to confront and deal with the cancer of the extremist ideology within its midst . The West continues to infantilize Muslims by somehow assuming that the war against the jihadis can be won with the great powers taking the lead role . `` Where is the panel ... on the Sunday talk shows where you have Muslim leaders alongside Western leaders to talk about how they 're going to conquer this problem , '' The West continues to infantilize Muslims by somehow assuming that the war against the jihadis can be won with the great powers taking the lead role . `` Where is the panel ... on the Sunday talk shows where you have Muslim leaders alongside Western leaders to talk about how they 're going to conquer this problem , '' asked Princeton Professor Amaney A.

It 's driven by a global jihad of radical and extremist Muslims who draw on actual and perversions of Islamic texts to kill Muslims and non-Muslims in an effort to impose their twisted vision of the world .
