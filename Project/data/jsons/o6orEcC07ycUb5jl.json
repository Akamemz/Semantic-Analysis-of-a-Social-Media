But the Republican National Committee ( RNC ) sees dollar signs .\nThe RNC has raised more than $ 104 million since Trump took office in January , fueled by a surge in donors who have never contributed to the party before . For the first time in recent memory , Republicans are raking in more money from those small-dollar donors than they are from big-spending whales who write four- or five-figure checks .\nThe surge in contributions has given Republicans a clear financial advantage a year before the midterm elections , an edge some Democrats see as threatening to their hopes of capitalizing on anti-Trump anger both among their base and among independent voters .\n\u201c I do think the Republican spending advantage is back , \u201d said Kelly Ward , a former executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ( DCCC ) . \u201c Democrats have worked hard to close the spending gap over the past few cycles , but the Republican donors are scared of losing power and are turning on the spigots . \u201d\nThe Republican National Committee ended September with $ 44 million in the bank , according to its latest filings with the Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) .
