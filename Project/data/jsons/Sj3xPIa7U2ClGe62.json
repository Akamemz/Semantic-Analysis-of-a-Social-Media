    "content": "( CNN ) Pope Francis delivered a fiery denunciation of modern capitalism on Thursday night , calling the `` unfettered pursuit of money '' the `` dung of the devil '' and accusing world leaders of `` cowardice '' for refusing to defend the earth from exploitation .\nSpeaking to grassroots organizers in Bolivia , the Pope urged the poor and disenfranchised to rise up against `` new colonialism , '' including corporations , loan agencies , free trade treaties , austerity measures , and `` the monopolizing of the communications media . ''\nHere 's what one prominent American priest had to say about the speech :\nPope Francis in Bolivia just used the strongest language I can remember a pope using about the rights of the poor and of social justice .\nThere is quite a lot to unpack in the speech , including the Pope 's apology for the `` many grave sins '' committed by Catholic Church against Native Americans `` in the name of God . ''\nAndrew Chesnut , an expert on Catholicism in Latin America , called the Pope 's apology the `` fullest '' the church has ever given for its colonial history in the region and `` the most significant aspect of his trip thus far . ''\nThe speech was pretty long , as even the Pope admitted :\n# PopeFrancis asks the crowd , `` Is the priest talking too much ? '' pic.twitter.com/EDOjRXNMpc \u2014 Catholic News Svc ( @ CatholicNewsSvc ) July 9 , 2015\nHere are the 7 most pungent quotes from the Pope 's speech :\n1 . `` This system is by now intolerable : farmworkers find it intolerable , laborers find it intolerable , communities find it intolerable , people find it intolerable ... The earth itself ... also finds it intolerable . ''\n2 . `` And behind all this pain , death and destruction there is the stench of what Basil of Caesarea , one of the church 's first theologians , called 'the dung of the devil . ' An unfettered pursuit of money rules . That is the dung of the devil . ''\n3 . `` Working for a just distribution of the fruits of the earth and human labor is not mere philanthropy . It is a moral obligation . For Christians , the responsibility is even greater : it is a commandment . ''\n4 . `` It is not enough to let a few drops fall whenever the poor shake a cup which never runs over by itself . ''\n5 . `` I humbly ask forgiveness , not only for the offenses of the Church herself , but also for crimes committed against the native peoples during the so-called conquest of America . ''\n6 . `` The new colonialism takes on different faces . At times it appears as the anonymous influence of mammon : corporations , loan agencies , certain 'free trade ' treaties , and the imposition of measures of 'austerity ' which always tighten the belt of workers and the poor . ''\n7 . `` Our common home is being pillaged , laid waste and harmed with impunity . Cowardice in defending it is a grave sin . We see with growing disappointment how one international summit after another takes place without any significant result . ''\nPope Francis also called the recent persecution of Christians a `` genocide . ''\n`` Today we are dismayed to see how in the Middle East and elsewhere in the world many of our brothers and sisters are persecuted , tortured and killed for their faith in Jesus . This too needs to be denounced : in this third world war , waged piecemeal , which we are now experiencing , a form of genocide -- and I stress the world genocide -- is taking place , and it must end . ''\nThe Pope said he 's often asked why he focuses so intently on what some Christians call the `` least and the lost . ''\nRead the Gospel , Francis answered on Tuesday , specifically Matthew 25 . In that passage , Jesus says that in the Last Days , Christians will be asked whether they fed the hungry , clothed the naked , visited the sick .\n`` This is the heart of the Gospel , '' the Pope said .\nAlmost invariably , Francis ends his speeches by asking people to pray for him .

''\nPope Francis landed in La Paz , Bolivia , on Wednesday afternoon , a city nearly 12,000 feet above sea level .\nAs noted above , there had been a lot of discussion about how the 78-year-old pontiff , who has only one fully functioning lung due to a childhood bout with pneumonia , will handle the extremely high altitude .\nAt least one Bolivian official suggested that he should chew coca leaves , a local and legal remedy in his host country .\nCheck out the video below by our Shasta Darlington , in which she asks people in La Paz what Francis should do .\nJUST WATCHED Altitude sickness an issue for Pope Francis in Bolivia Replay More Videos ...

And he warned priests , and bishops for that matter , not to fall prey to `` spiritual Alzheimer 's , '' a punchy phrase he has used quite often in the last few years .\nThe word that Francis kept coming back to is `` gratuidad , '' mentioning it at least a dozen times during the papal pep talk .

''\nFrancis ' call for environmental protection , a prevalent theme in his papacy , came on the second full day of his weeklong tour of South America . He was speaking to a group of civic leaders and indigenous people at San Francisco Church in Quito , Ecuador 's capital city .\nLater this week , Francis will visit Bolivia and Paraguay . Like Ecuador , both countries are home to vast natural resources but also problems like deforestation , pollution and widespread poverty .\nIn recent months , indigenous groups have protested Ecuador 's president , Rafael Correa , saying that his promotion of drilling and mining near the Amazon rainforest could ruin their ancestral homeland .\nThe Pope left little doubt about whose side he takes .\n`` The tapping of natural resources , which are so abundant in Ecuador , must not be concerned with short-term benefits , '' Francis said .\nIt was interesting to see the Pope speak so specifically about his host country 's environmental policies . An apt analogy might be Francis coming out against the Keystone Pipeline when he addresses the U.S. Congress this September .\nEarlier on Tuesday , the Pope told Catholic students and educators that the purpose of education is not to boost our social status or pad our bank accounts , but to find creative ways to help the poor and save the environment .\nIn an impassioned speech -- it was as animated as Francis has been thus far in his South American trip -- the Pope raised his voice , urging students to `` make a fuss '' and telling teachers not to `` play the professor . ''\nThe setting for Tuesday 's speech was the Pontifical Catholic University of Ecuador , where a crowd of thousands gathered under drizzling skies .\n`` My question to you , as educators , is this : Do you watch over your students , helping them to develop a critical sense , an open mind capable of caring for today 's world ? '' the Pope asked . `` Are you able to encourage them not to disregard the world around them ? ''\nThat kind of education , Francis said , only takes place outside of the classroom . Like a teacher underlining an important point -- Francis taught high school and was rector of a college in Argentina -- the Pope raised his voice and pumped his arms .\n`` As a university , as educational institutions , as teachers and students , life itself challenges us to answer this question : What does the world need us for ? Where is your brother ? ''\nHe urged the students , who cheered at the mention of their name , that the mark of a good education is a feeling of `` greater responsibility , in the face of today 's problems , to the needs of the poor , concern for the environment . ''\nThose two themes , poverty and care for creation , are intricately intertwined , the Pope argued in his recent encyclical , `` Laudato Si . '' Vatican officials said that Pope Francis chose the nations on this trip to highlight the political and spiritual lessons contained in the 180-page letter to the world .\nTuesday was Pope Francis ' second full day in Ecuador , the first stop on an eight-day trip that will also take him to Bolivia and Paraguay .\nHe celebrated a Mass Tuesday morning at Bicentennial Park in Quito , Ecuador 's capital . Crowds were in place for hours -- as was the choir , which sang a song about `` Santo Padre '' ( Holy Father ) almost all morning .\nMore than 1 million Catholics turned out for the Mass , organizers say . The lines for Holy Communion were quite long .\nJUST WATCHED Massive crowds gather for Pope 's Mass Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Massive crowds gather for Pope 's Mass 02:06\nIn his homily ( sermon ) , Francis connected the themes of political liberty and religious evangelism , drawing loud cheers from the crowd . He noted that Bicentennial Park commemorates Ecuador 's independence from Spain and called on Catholics to set aside their differences and be `` builders of unity . ''\nThe Pope continued an early theme of his visit at the Mass : focusing on faith rather than geopolitics . Ecuador 's president , Rafael Correa , has tried to portray Francis as a close ally , but the pontiff has kept his rhetorical distance , declining to explicitly endorse the embattled Ecuadorian .\nHere are three key quotes from the Pope 's homily Tuesday morning :\n-- `` Our unity can hardly shine forth if spiritual worldliness makes us feud among ourselves in a futile quest for power , prestige , pleasure or economic security . ''\n-- `` Evangelization does not consist in proselytizing ... but in attracting by our witness those who are far off , in humbly drawing near to those who feel distant from God and the church , those who are fearful or indifferent ... ''\n-- `` How beautiful it would be if we could admire how much we care for one another , how we encourage and help each other . ''\nOn Monday , at another Mass , the Pope focused his sermon on the family and hinted that changes that some Catholics might consider `` scandalous '' could be coming to the church .\nFrancis was a bit vague about what he had in mind , but he said that bishops meeting this fall will be looking for `` concrete solutions '' to some of the challenges facing modern families . Most likely , he was referring to how the church ministers to divorced Catholics and LGBT families .\nAfter the Mass , the Pope met an old friend and had lunch with the Jesuit community . ( Francis is the first Jesuit pope . ) He also took many , many selfies throughout the day and shook many , many hands .\nIt took Francis nearly an hour to get through the line Monday night at the presidential palace . He 's 78 , but he has the smile and the stamina of a much younger man .\nIt 's clear that Ecuadorians are super excited about seeing the first Latin American Pope 's on his first trip to Spanish-speaking countries . This gallery of papal memorabilia conveys some of the essence .\nLate Monday night , the Pope said goodnight and went to bed . Except the crowd would n't let him , singing and praying outside the Vatican Embassy , where he 's staying in Quito . Finally , the Pope came out , gave the crowd a quick blessing and then firmly told them to go home and let the neighbors get some rest .\nJUST WATCHED Rise of evangelical 'garage churches ' Replay More Videos ...

Hide Caption 37 of 37\n\nIn an impassioned speech -- it was as animated as Francis has been thus far in his South American trip -- the Pope raised his voice, urging students to \"make a fuss\" and telling teachers not to \"play the professor.\"\n\nThe setting for Tuesday's speech was the Pontifical Catholic University of Ecuador, where a crowd of thousands gathered under drizzling skies.\n\n\"My question to you, as educators, is this: Do you watch over your students, helping them to develop a critical sense, an open mind capable of caring for today's world?\" the Pope asked. \"Are you able to encourage them not to disregard the world around them?\"\n\nThat kind of education, Francis said, only takes place outside of the classroom. Like a teacher underlining an important point -- Francis taught high school and was rector of a college in Argentina -- the Pope raised his voice and pumped his arms.\n\n\"As a university, as educational institutions, as teachers and students, life itself challenges us to answer this question: What does the world need us for? Where is your brother?\"\n\nHe urged the students, who cheered at the mention of their name, that the mark of a good education is a feeling of \"greater responsibility, in the face of today's problems, to the needs of the poor, concern for the environment.\"\n\nThose two themes, poverty and care for creation, are intricately intertwined, the Pope argued in his recent encyclical, \"Laudato Si.\" Vatican officials said that Pope Francis chose the nations on this trip to highlight the political and spiritual lessons contained in the 180-page letter to the world.\n\nTuesday was Pope Francis ' second full day in Ecuador, the first stop on an eight-day trip that will also take him to Bolivia and Paraguay.\n\nHe celebrated a Mass Tuesday morning at Bicentennial Park in Quito, Ecuador's capital. Crowds were in place for hours -- as was the choir, which sang a song about \"Santo Padre\" (Holy Father) almost all morning.\n\nMore than 1 million Catholics turned out for the Mass, organizers say. The lines for Holy Communion were quite long.\n\nJUST WATCHED Massive crowds gather for Pope's Mass Replay More Videos ...

He noted that Bicentennial Park commemorates Ecuador's independence from Spain and called on Catholics to set aside their differences and be \"builders of unity.\"\n\nThe Pope continued an early theme of his visit at the Mass: focusing on faith rather than geopolitics. Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, has tried to portray Francis as a close ally, but the pontiff has kept his rhetorical distance, declining to explicitly endorse the embattled Ecuadorian.\n\nHere are three key quotes from the Pope's homily Tuesday morning:\n\n-- \"Our unity can hardly shine forth if spiritual worldliness makes us feud among ourselves in a futile quest for power, prestige, pleasure or economic security.\"\n\n-- \"Evangelization does not consist in proselytizing ... but in attracting by our witness those who are far off, in humbly drawing near to those who feel distant from God and the church, those who are fearful or indifferent ...\"\n\n-- \"How beautiful it would be if we could admire how much we care for one another, how we encourage and help each other.\"\n\n'Scandalous' changes?\n\nOn Monday, at another Mass, the Pope focused his sermon on the family and hinted that changes that some Catholics might consider \"scandalous\" could be coming to the church.\n\nFrancis was a bit vague about what he had in mind, but he said that bishops meeting this fall will be looking for \"concrete solutions\" to some of the challenges facing modern families. Most likely, he was referring to how the church ministers to divorced Catholics and LGBT families.\n\nAfter the Mass, the Pope met an old friend and had lunch with the Jesuit community . (Francis is the first Jesuit pope.) He also took many, many selfies throughout the day and shook many, many hands.\n\nIt took Francis nearly an hour to get through the line Monday night at the presidential palace. He's 78, but he has the smile and the stamina of a much younger man.\n\nIt's clear that Ecuadorians are super excited about seeing the first Latin American Pope's on his first trip to Spanish-speaking countries. This gallery of papal memorabilia conveys some of the essence.\n\nPhotos: Pope memorabilia in South America A street vendor sells cutout images of Pope Francis near the airport in El Alto, Bolivia, on Wednesday, July 8.
