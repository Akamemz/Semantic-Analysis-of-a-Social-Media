    "content": "Analysis : GOP Health Plan May Not Fix The Problems They Want To Fix\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan from Wisconsin has been complaining about the Affordable Care Act ( aka Obamacare ) for so long that his list of grievances sounds like a refrain of some pop song .\n`` Obamacare is collapsing , '' he said on Feb. 28 . `` The Democrats got too far ahead on their ideology and they gave us a system where government runs health care . They gave us a system where costs went up , not down . They gave us a system where choices went away . They gave us a system where people lost the plans they liked , they chose . ''\nAnd Ryan 's not the only one . Republicans in Congress have spent the past several years detailing what is wrong with the ACA . And in every election since it passed , nearly every Republican candidate , including President Trump , has vowed to get rid of the law and put something better in its place .\nOn Monday evening , House Republicans finally released their own health care proposal . It would replace Obamacare 's mandate to buy insurance and his subsidies to bring down the cost with a fixed refundable tax credit that people can use to buy coverage . Nobody 's required to have a health plan . But if you do n't get covered at the outset , you 'll pay a penalty to buy it later .\nSo does it fix the problems Republicans have laid out ? Likely not .\n`` It 's debatable whether the market is imploding or not , '' says Cynthia Cox , associate director of the Program for the Study of Health Reform and Private Insurance at the Kaiser Family Foundation .\n`` On one hand , they 're getting rid of the individual mandate [ for most people to buy insurance ] , and that would have the effect of destabilizing the market and raising premiums , '' Cox says .\nAnd the penalty for allowing a gap in your health insurance coverage could help , or it could make it worse , she says .\nThe penalty could be `` a disincentive for healthy people to sign up , '' she says .\nThat 's the central challenge both approaches face . A healthy market needs a lot of healthy people so that premiums are spread across a broad population to care for sick people . Without that , the market struggles to keep costs low and choices high .\nThe Affordable Care Act 's markets have been struggling , no doubt . Several insurance companies have dropped out , leaving some states and counties with only one company offering plans . At the same time , premiums have risen in many markets . Last year , premiums rose an average 22 percent \u2014 though individual cost increases varied because federal subsidies for many people rose in tandem with premiums .\nRyan says he wants consumers to have more choices and lower costs .\n`` Instead of fewer choices , we want our health care system to be truly competitive . Insurers should compete for your business and treat you fairly , '' he said on Feb. 22 . `` All of this will lower cost and end the annual sticker shock of higher premiums . ''\nNot necessarily , says Paul Howard , a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute .\n`` There 's not enough flexibility from the insurers ' point of view to offer lower cost plans , '' he says .\nThat 's because Republicans are hamstrung by politics , he says . They ca n't repeal the Affordable Care Act outright without the help of Democrats , which they wo n't get . So in order to get a bill through , congressional rules say they have to limit it to matters that deal with taxes or the budget .\nWhich means all the benefits that the existing health care law says have to be included in a health insurance policy would remain . And that means insurance companies ca n't offer cheap health plans .\n`` I do n't see it being abundantly clear that premiums will be significantly lower under this bill than they are in the Affordable Care Act , '' says Cox of Kaiser . `` And there is evidence the out-of-pocket costs could go up , '' she says .\nThat 's because the Affordable Care Act offers subsidies to cover the deductibles and copayments for lower-income people . The Ryan plan offers a fixed tax credit \u2014 between $ 2,000 and $ 4,000 depending on age \u2014 that would likely lead many people to buy health plans they have to shell out a lot of money for up front , called high deductible plans .\nCox 's analysis shows that wealthier people get more help from the new Republican plan while lower income people benefit more from Obamacare .\nRepublicans are hamstrung in part by the fact that they ca n't repeal the Affordable Care Act in one go and fully replace it with their own vision .\nEven if the bill did meet Paul Ryan 's goals , it certainly does n't fulfill President Trump 's campaign promises .\n`` Everybody 's got to be covered , '' he said in an interview with 60 Minutes in 2015 . `` This is an un-Republican thing for me to say , because a lot of times they say , 'No , no , the lower 25 percent , they ca n't afford private .
