''\nHowever , Democrats want to see Boehner 's offer and are very suspicious of what he said on the floor this morning .\nBoehner said the meeting at the White House Sunday afternoon was `` cordial '' -- but Republicans are `` still waiting for the White House to identify what spending cuts the president is willing to make as part of the balanced approach that he promised the American people . ''\nBoehner said he remains `` hopeful '' a deal can be reached , but said Obama has an `` obligation '' to put forward a new and specific plan if he objects to the plan Republicans proffered last week .\n`` The longer the White House slow-walks this process , the closer our economy gets to the fiscal cliff , '' he said . `` We know that the president wants more stimulus spending and an increase in the debt limit without any cuts or reforms .
