Madison in 1803 , the judiciary has served as the ultimate arbiter of the law and a check on the other branches of government .\nBut in other ways , the answer was simply stating the reality of much of the past century . Until recently , the courts have deferred when asked to check the steadily expanding power of the executive branch . That was a matter for the president to work out with Congress , the legal thinking went .\nBut now there are signs that the judiciary may be increasingly willing to pull back on the reins \u2013 at least a bit . And regardless of whether Mr. Trump \u2019 s individual executive order is upheld or not , the high-profile legal battles over it seem to be drawing more public \u2013 and judicial \u2013 attention to how executive power has expanded , and its potential consequences .\n\u201c We need to be aware that the decisions the courts are making , and the assertions the Trump administration is making in these cases , are going to apply not only to these cases but to assertions of executive authority in the future , \u201d says Steven Schwinn , an associate professor at the John Marshall Law School in Chicago .\nThe growing willingness to scrutinize executive power can be traced at least partly to the recent rise in legal challenges , experts say . As George W. Bush and Barack Obama pushed the limits of executive authority , legal pushback has grown .\n\u201c The Supreme Court has reined in the more extreme claims of executive authority that we have seen in the last two presidential administrations , \u201d says Professor Schwinn .\nThere was widespread litigation , particularly from civil liberties groups , over many of Mr. Bush \u2019 s actions responding to the 9/11 attacks , and Republican state attorneys general systematically challenged many of Mr. Obama \u2019 s executive actions .\nNow Trump is issuing a flurry of his own executive orders , including the one currently before a panel of the Ninth Circuit . It bars citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States for 90 days . It also prevents entry for all refugees for 120 days and indefinitely halts the admission of Syrian refugees .\nThe Ninth Circuit is considering whether to uphold a federal judge \u2019 s decision to block the order . Its ruling is expected within days , and the case is considered likely to end up at the US Supreme Court . In a sign of the keen public interest , more than 2.6 million people listened to the hearing , which was streamed live .\nThe Constitution doesn \u2019 t actually endow the president with much unilateral authority . Coming out of a monarchy and wary of concentrating power in an individual , the Framers granted the president only one independent power : the ability to issue pardons and reprieves .\n\u201c Obviously that has changed significantly over time , \u201d says Mark Rozell , dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University and an expert on presidential power .\nMost scholars trace this expansion to Franklin Roosevelt , who entered the White House at the nadir of the Great Depression and launched an aggressive , executive-driven agenda to revive the country . His flurry of actions during his first 100 days in office transformed Americans \u2019 views and expectations of what the president should do .\nThere is now an \u201c underlying assumption \u201d that a president should do as President Roosevelt did , says Dr. Rozell , author of \u201c Executive Privilege : Presidential Power , Secrecy , and Accountability . \u201d\nSpecifically , a president is expected to come in \u201c with a bold vision , an activist agenda , and a plan to bulldoze it through Congress , \u201d he adds .\nThere may be valid reasons for broadening executive powers , says Ernest Young , a constitutional law professor at Duke University School of Law .\nThe executive branch is inherently the most nimble branch , and can respond quickest to crises and emergencies . As the branch has grown , it has also accrued more expertise on subjects from housing and water quality to space travel and terrorism .\nBut presidents haven \u2019 t been the only ones to expand executive powers . Most of presidents \u2019 current powers have been delegated by Congress and upheld by the federal court system .\nPart of Trump \u2019 s justification for his order , for example , is that the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act , passed by Congress , gives him the power to suspend the entry of \u201c any class of aliens \u201d into the US if it \u201c would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. \u201d ( Opponents disagree with this interpretation . )\nCongress has also enacted laws giving the president broad discretion in war , national security , and foreign policy .

Part of this stems from the judiciary \u2019 s fundamental role in government \u2013 to not be a rulemaking body , but to assess the legality of rules enacted by Congress and the president . Yet the judicial branch has also arguably facilitated the decades-long expansion of executive power .\nThe Chevron doctrine , for example , originates from a 1984 Supreme Court case . It holds that , if Congress passes an ambiguous law , the executive branch regulatory agencies should be able to interpret those laws \u2013 unless the agencies \u2019 interpretations are unreasonable .\nMeanwhile , for the past 80 years , the high court has essentially ignored the doctrine that there are constitutional limits \u2013 to be determined by the judiciary \u2013 on the legislative powers that Congress can delegate to the executive . Since 1935 , the court has never found a delegation of power by Congress to the executive unconstitutional .\nEssentially , the court \u201c has been upholding any and all delegations of power to the president \u201d since 1935 , says Professor Young .\nBut the increased attention has seen the courts begin to check executive power a bit more .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not sure the courts are interested in particular in reining in executive power , but I do think [ they ] are taking a closer look at these cases , \u201d says Schwinn .\nFurthermore , a number of judges and scholars \u2013 including Neil Gorsuch , Trump \u2019 s nominee to the Supreme Court \u2013 have become increasingly critical of the Chevron doctrine .
