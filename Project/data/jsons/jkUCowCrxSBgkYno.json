Moreover , the NSA has beefed up its private contracts with outside companies to meet the increased demand for surveillance and other counterterrorism activities in the wake of 9/11.It now uses nearly 500 private companies to help conduct electronic and other intelligence operations . Among them is Booz Allen Hamilton , the company that employed 's collection of private phone and Internet communications data.Snowden 's disclosures shook the government and roused outrage on Capitol Hill and with the public to a certain degree , but the agency has been monitoring e-mails , cellphone , social media , and other forms of communication for more than decade in the effort to track down Osama bin Laden and other al-Qaida-affiliated terrorist groups . `` There was nothing that gave you more insight into the inner workings of these organizations as the NSA , '' said Michael Leiter , former director of the National Counter\u00adTerrorism Center . `` I can \u2019 t think of any terrorist investigation where the NSA was not a pre\u00ademinent or central player . `` One of Snowden 's documents reveals that as far back as 2000 , one year before the Sept. 11 attacks , 60 percent of the president 's daily intelligence briefing already was coming from the NSA.Agency officials told the Post that the foreign signals it collects are `` invaluable to national security '' and `` helps the agency determine where adversaries are located , what they \u2019 re planning , when they \u2019 re planning to carry it out , with whom they \u2019 re working , and the kinds of weapons they \u2019 re using . `` The NSA 's covert surveillance capabilities have made it the spearhead of U.S. intelligence operations , a position that one NSA unit notes with its unofficial motto : `` We Track 'Em , You Whack 'Em . `` The motto stems from 2001 drone strike that took out an al-Qaida target in Afghanistan whom the NSA tracked by the usage of a cellphone , according to the Post.The NSA 's operation has grown from the early tracking of cellphones to other areas , including the mining of financial and biometric data , the movement of money overseas , and collection of phone and other communications information.The growth led to more employees and bigger facilities to house new computer systems and other networks to collect , store , and analyze tons of information.In 2007 , for example , the NSA broke ground on a $ 1 billion facility at Fort Gordon , Ga. , where 4,000 workers collect and process signal intelligence from the Middle East.The agency also added 250,000 square feet to its workspace in Hawaii , where Snowden worked before stealing thousands of top-secret documents.The growth also has stretched overseas , including a one-third increase in the size of the NSA station at RAF Menwith Hill in Yorkshire , England , where , according to the Post , electronic intelligence information is collected from parts of Europe , the Middle East , and North Africa.Yet another overseas NSA site , Pine Gap in Australia , has added facilities and hundreds of workers in recent years.An NSA official told the Post the upgrades were done to make the agency 's `` global enterprise even more seamless as we confronted increasingly networked adversaries . `` But , this official added , the efforts `` to exploit the foreign communications of adversaries and defend vital U.S. networks '' are always conducted `` in accordance with national priorities and in full accordance with U.S . law .
