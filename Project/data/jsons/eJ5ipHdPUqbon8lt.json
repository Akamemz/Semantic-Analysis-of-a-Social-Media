    "content": "Democrats continued to send mixed signals on impeachment Thursday , even as the House Judiciary Committee moved ahead with approving procedures for their investigation into President Trump .\nThe committee voted 24-17 to implement four procedures , marking the first time the panel voted on what Judiciary Democrats are calling an impeachment investigation .\nThe rules would allow Chairman Jerrold Nadler , New York Democrat , to delegate some of the work to subcommittees ; give committee staff extra time to question witnesses ; govern how information is kept private ; and allow for President Trump \u2019 s legal team to review and respond .\nThe vote Thursday was not a question of whether to impeachment the president , but merely lays out investigation rules that would determine whether Democrats should offer articles of impeachment . Mr. Nadler has publicly said his panel is conducting formal impeachment proceedings with this investigation , and attempted to brush aside the debate during Thursday \u2019 s vote .\n\u201c Some call this process an impeachment inquiry , some call it an impeachment investigation . There is no legal difference between these terms , and I no longer care to argue about the nomenclature , \u201d he said .\nJudiciary Democrats have embraced that , saying this impeachment investigation has been going on for a while . Other Democrats have offered different descriptions of what they thought the committee was up to \u2014 one member told The Times it was crafting language to start an impeachment inquiry .\nOn Thursday , a handful of members took up the \u201c impeachment investigation \u201d term , including Rep. Hakeem Jeffries , who had avoided the \u201c i word \u201d just the day before .\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi , however , is not wavering on her own messaging .\n\u201c Impeachment is a very divisive measure , but if we have to go there , we \u2019 ll go there . But we can \u2019 t go there unless we have the facts , \u201d she said .\nNotably , she \u2019 s avoided both explicitly shutting down the term \u201c impeachment investigation \u201d and using it herself . Rather , she doubled down on the argument she \u2019 s been using for months \u2014 impeachment is a possibility but six committees first must finish their months-long investigations .\n\u201c I stand by what we have been doing all along . I support what is happening in the Judiciary Committee because that enables them to do their process of interrogation and their investigation . And I salute them for that work , \u201d Mrs. Pelosi told reporters on Thursday .\n\u201c That \u2019 s all I \u2019 m going to way on the subject , and there \u2019 s nothing different from one day to the next , \u201d she added .\nRepublicans argue the confusion and disarray from Democrats on impeachment is because they \u2019 re circumventing the proper process .\nRep. Doug Collins of Georgia , the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee , has repeatedly pushed back on Mr. Nadler \u2019 s claim that the committee was working on formal impeachment proceedings , arguing that they would need a full House vote to authorize such an investigation .\n\u201c The difference between formal impeachment proceedings and what we \u2019 re doing today is a world apart no matter what the chairman just said , \u201d Mr. Collins said .\n\u201c The ambiguity \u2014 the confusion \u2014 is a product of my colleagues \u2019 own making because there is an easy way to know exactly whether this committee is in impeachment proceedings : it \u2019 s called a vote \u2014 a vote of the full House of Representatives , \u201d he added .\nAt the GOP retreat in Baltimore on Thursday afternoon , both Mr. Collins and Rep.
