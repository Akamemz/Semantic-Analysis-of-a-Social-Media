    "content": "Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has a new TV ad out this week , and it shows in vividly brilliant terms exactly why he is overwhelming Hillary Clinton \u2019 s traditional establishment-style campaign . His campaign is about us ; it \u2019 s not about him . He doesn \u2019 t highlight his experience or plans to get things done . He channels all of our desire to make our country better and make it work for everyone . His \u201c us \u201d is all of us normal Americans against \u201c them , \u201d the broken system and partisan political establishment .\nSanders is not the only one with this kind of formula of success . Republican front-runner Donald Trump is doing much the same thing . The difference is that Trump \u2019 s \u201c us \u201d doesn \u2019 t include everyone . His us is mostly just straight , white Christians . His \u201c them \u201d isn \u2019 t just the political establishment , it \u2019 s the people who are different from his `` us . '' His `` them '' includes immigrants , Muslims and anyone else he can find to blame our country \u2019 s problems on . His `` us '' doesn \u2019 t include enough voters to win a national election , but he sure can win a Republican primary because it \u2019 s a party of mostly straight , white Christians .\nHillary Clinton was once the unbeatable candidate , but her inevitability has dissolved because of her campaign \u2019 s inability to connect with voters and include all of us on a personal level . She actually started the campaign off on the right foot . Her \u201c everyday Americans \u201d announcement video and early campaign theme struck the right tone . It was essentially , \u201c It \u2019 s about you and me , America . Let \u2019 s work together to make our country better. \u201d Hillary Clinton \u2019 s campaign went south went she started making it about her and her experience .\nClinton \u2019 s new slogans reflect a shift away from everyday Americans . Slogans such as \u201c Fighting for Us \u201d or her hashtag \u201c # ImwithHer \u201d don \u2019 t include her with us . Why not \u201c Fighting Together \u201d or \u201c She \u2019 s with Us \u201d ? She shouldn \u2019 t be removed from us , it should be \u201c we \u2019 re in this together. \u201d It \u2019 s not just slogans that separate her from us , it \u2019 s her language . She regularly speaks in the first person singular , \u201c I , \u201d while her opponent almost always says , \u201c we . \u201d\nWhy the shift ? I suspect that the campaign received great feedback after her stellar performances in the first debate and the Benghazi hearing , and they saw that her experience and unmatched depth of knowledge are their best assets . Indeed , they are her best asset , but making the campaign about her preparedness to be president puts the focus in the wrong place .\nWhen a campaign is about the candidate , then that shines the light on them . That light reveals what we like about them , but it also reminds us about everything we dislike about them . Sanders isn \u2019 t making his campaign about him , and that \u2019 s why voters aren \u2019 t focused on the fact that he \u2019 s a 1960s-era radical socialist , who now wants to be commander-in-chief after being a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War .\nClinton has also employed the old partisan language of the broken political establishment by recently ranting on about how our country does better under Democrats than under Republicans , and she \u2019 s a good Democrat and Bernie \u2019 s not . She \u2019 s also embraced high-profile endorsements from elected officials and the political establishment in Washington . That only serves to remind us that she is not us . She \u2019 s them .
