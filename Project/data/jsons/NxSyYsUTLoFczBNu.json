The problem is that we haven \u2019 t been talking about race . All of those things become very , very real to us . \u201d\nIndeed , at least part of Mayor Johnson \u2019 s actions sprang from the experience of his own family . His father , sister , and brother-in-law , who live in New York City , had each contracted the virus . A deacon at his church had died .\nNow , Mr. Johnson \u2019 s approach is coming into conflict with his governor \u2019 s . Georgia Gov . Brian Kemp , a Republican , announced the state \u2013 among the last to issue a stay-at-home order \u2013 would begin to restart its economy last week . Gyms , bowling alleys , tattoo parlors , as well as hair salons and barbershops , were allowed to reopen on April 24 with strict social-distancing rules \u00ad\u2013 a move the Savannah mayor called \u201c reckless , premature , and dangerous . \u201d\nSavannah , which is 54 % black , has seen its cases stabilize . Its numbers have also been more evenly distributed across racial groups . That has helped change the attitudes of many of Savannah \u2019 s black residents . Early resistance has shifted to solid support \u2013 and kinder messages , the mayor says .\n\u201c This virus ain \u2019 t racist , \u201d says Bobby Lewis , pitmaster at Randy \u2019 s BBQ , a popular local haunt that has stayed open for delivery and pickup . \u201c No one is immune .

Since March , a number of national polls have indicated that black and Hispanic Americans have been more concerned about the virus than white Americans .
