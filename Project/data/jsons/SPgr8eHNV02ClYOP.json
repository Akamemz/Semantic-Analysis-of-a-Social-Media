John McCain , R-Ariz. , issued a blistering statement Thursday morning in response to the latest violence in Syria . `` American credibility in the Middle East has never been lower , '' he said .\nThe Republican National Committee , meanwhile , derisively dubbed the Obama trip the `` lame duck '' bus tour .\nBut White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Thursday that having Obama on the road and rolling out new education reforms for American families is exactly where the president \u2019 s focus should be .\n`` As we 're weighing these domestic policy positions and foreign policy decisions , the president puts the interests of the United States of America first , '' Earnest said . `` The fact that we are doing this bus tour is an indication that the president has his priorities straight . ''\nDuring Obama \u2019 s 27-minute speech , he told a group of 7,000 students , parents and alumni packed into the upstate New York arena that Americas can not afford \u201c the usual circus of distractions and political posturing \u201d over the budget , health care and other issues .\nHe also said that higher education could not be a \u201c luxury \u201d and said that \u201c every American family should be able to get it . \u201d\nOn the crises in the Middle East , the administration is still weighing its options . In Egypt , the U.S. is torn between two risky options : condemning the military-backed government , and potentially emboldening the Muslim Brotherhood ; or overtly backing the Egyptian military , and ignoring its ouster of elected president Mohammed Morsi . And in Syria , the administration has been reluctant to engage militarily despite mounting signs that the Assad regime has crossed the so-called `` red line '' Obama set regarding the use of chemical weapons .\nThe White House has ordered the U.S. intelligence community to probe the latest alleged chemical attack and get to the bottom of what happened .\nThe president \u2019 s stop in Buffalo , meanwhile , was the first in his two-day bus tour , which will take him to parts of western and central New York as well as northeastern Pennsylvania .\nDuring his speech , Obama also unveiled a broad new government rating system for colleges that would judge schools on their affordability and perhaps be used to allocate federal financial aid .\nFor colleges and universities , millions of federal aid dollars could be on the line if schools are downgraded under the government rating system . However , if colleges line up against the idea of tying ratings to federal aid , the proposal would face nearly impossible odds . Almost all members of Congress have colleges or universities in their districts , and a coordinated effort to rally students and educators against the plan would probably kill it quickly .\n`` This is extraordinarily complicated stuff , and it 's not clear we have the complete data or accurate data , '' said Molly Corbett Broad , the president of the American Council on Education that represents colleges and universities in Washington .\nThe education proposals are part of the broader economic agenda Obama has been pitching across the country this summer . The tour is aimed at building public support for his economic policies ahead of fiscal fights with Congress this fall .\nThe rising cost of college has increasingly become a burden for many Americans . According to administration figures , the tuition costs at public , four-year universities have tripled over the last 30 years and average student loan debt stands at $ 26,000 .\nOver the past five years , the tuition sticker price at public four-year colleges is up 27 percent beyond overall inflation , according to a College Board survey . At private schools , the average student 's cost has risen 13 percent beyond overall inflation .\nThere has been little consensus among policymakers on how to curb college costs .\nWhile Obama 's proposal could give colleges an incentive to slow increases , it could also add massive reporting requirements that could be a burden on schools already struggling to make ends meet .\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill like Rep. John Kline , R-Minn. , urged caution .\n\u201c While I am pleased the president 's new plan recognizes the importance of promoting innovation and competition in higher education , I remain concerned that imposing an arbitrary college ranking system could curtail the very innovation we hope to encourage - and even lead to federal price controls , \u201d Kline said in a written statement . \u201c As always , the devil is in the details , and I look forward to examining the president 's proposal further as part of the committee 's ongoing efforts to reauthorize the Higher Education Act and help improve college affordability and access . \u201d\nThe new rating system does not require congressional approval , and the White House is aiming to have it set up before the 2015 school year . But Obama does need support from Congress in order to use the ratings as a basis for parceling out federal financial aid .\nIn addition to tuition , schools will also be rated on average student loan debt , graduation rates and the average earnings of graduates .
