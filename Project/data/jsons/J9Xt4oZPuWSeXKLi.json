As conservative debate over the 'Gang of Eight ' proposal begins in earnest , Democrats are reportedly pleasantly surprised by the contents of the legislation :\nThe Senate \u2019 s Gang of Eight delivered an immigration overhaul bill this week that was far more generous to their constituencies than Democrats and Hispanic activists expected . The pre-bill marketing campaign \u2014 driven by leaks that seemed to come from Republican negotiators \u2014 focused on stringent new border-control measures and a long , difficult path to citizenship . The goal was to minimize conservative opposition by creating a first impression of the bill as a tough solution to the country \u2019 s illegal immigration problem . But when Democrats got a look at the 844-page measure , they discovered that their negotiators extracted more concessions than they thought possible . Those include an expansive version of the DREAM Act and subtle but meaningful tradeoffs on all the major pieces of the system , from family reunification to legalization and border security . Democrats are reluctant to sound too positive , fearing that would scare away Republicans . Their official response to the bill has been muted , with one press release after another calling it a starting point that must be improved . Yet that description , while an accurate reflection of their political strategy heading into the debate , understates the extent to which Democrats believe their side made off with more policy victories than it could \u2019 ve predicted .\nWhy are liberals quietly celebrating ? Policy specifics . GOP negotiators extracted some concessions , but Democrats engineered a plan that offers a generous and immediate amnesty * [ see update ] to millions :\nRepublicans succeeded in making the path to legalization contingent upon the government meeting border security benchmarks , prohibiting undocumented immigrants from accessing federal benefits even as they pay taxes , blocking a provision to allow foreign spouses of same-sex couples to apply for visas , and creating a temporary worker program .

Immigrants barred from gaining the provisional legal status because of a criminal record from long-ago offenses can seek a waiver . The bill contains a far more expansive version of the DREAM Act than Congress has ever considered . Undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children would have to wait only five years to receive a green card , and they could immediately apply for citizenship .
