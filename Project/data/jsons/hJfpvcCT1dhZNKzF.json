    "content": "MILWAUKEE \u2014 Republican presidential hopeful Ben Carson lashed out at the press and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in the same swipe Tuesday in the fourth primary-season debate , saying he can stand up to media scrutiny but wants to make sure journalists treat her similarly for her words on the Benghazi terrorist attack .\nIn one of the feistiest debates of the year , Republicans clashed over how to handle illegal immigrants , with Ohio Gov . John Kasich and former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush insisting that those in the U.S. illegally need to be granted legal status , and businessman Donald Trump saying that \u2019 s unfair to those waiting to come legally .\nThe candidates also turned their fire on Democrats , drawing sharp distinctions between their own economic policies and President Obama \u2019 s , which they said has devastated the country . Mrs. Clinton , the Democratic presidential front-runner , also was a target .\nMr. Carson , pushing back against questions from the press poking at the details of his life story , said he has \u201c no problem with being vetted \u201d but said he does object to \u201c being lied about , and then putting that out there as true . \u201d\n\u201c I don \u2019 t even mind that so much if they do it with everybody , like people on the other side , \u201d he said \u2014 pointing specifically at Mrs. Clinton , who he said misled the country when she publicly blamed the 2012 attack on an anti-Islam video while privately emailing her daughter that it was a terrorist-orchestrated assault .\n\u201c Where I came from , they call that a lie , \u201d he said .\nImmigration has been a dividing line within the Republican Party for years , and it surged to the forefront of the debate after a federal appeals court Monday blocked Mr. Obama \u2019 s 2014 deportation amnesty , saying he broke immigration law .\nBut Mr. Kasich and Mr. Bush said the ruling only increases pressure on Republicans to come up with their own plan to grant illegal immigrants legal status .\n\u201c We all know you can \u2019 t pick them up and ship them back across the border , \u201d Mr. Kasich said , calling Mr. Trump \u2019 s get-tough stance \u201c a silly argument . \u201d\nMr. Trump fired back , calling Mr. Kasich \u201c a pinhead \u201d for how he has run Ohio , and saying former President Dwight D. Eisenhower managed to kick out more than 1 million illegal immigrants during his tenure , and the U.S. needs to do it again .\nThe politics of the debate boiled over , with Mr. Bush saying Mrs. Clinton and her aides were \u201c high-fiving one another \u201d over the internal party fight , figuring that Hispanic voters will punish Republicans for the tenor of their immigration comments .\nSen. Ted Cruz of Texas retorted , \u201c The Democrats are laughing because if Republicans join Democrats as the party of amnesty , we will lose .\n\u201c We \u2019 re tired of being told we \u2019 re anti-immigrant . It \u2019 s offensive , \u201d he said , adding that the debate often ignores the effects of illegal immigration on American jobs .\n\u201c I would say the politics of it would be very , very , different if a bunch of lawyers or bankers were crossing the Rio Grande \u2014 or if a bunch of people with journalism degrees were coming over and driving down the wages in the press , \u201d said Mr. Cruz , noting that he was the son of a Cuban immigrant .\nThe debate , airing on the Fox Business Network , delved more deeply into policy than the previous three debates .\nThat was in part a result of the narrowed field , with just eight candidates on stage for the prime-time debate , rather than the 10 or 11 who participated in previous debates . The economic subject matter also lent itself to intense debates over tax cuts .\nSen. Marco Rubio , Florida Republican , defended his child tax credit as good policy , saying struggling families need more help to pay for one of their biggest costs .\nSen. Rand Paul shot back , saying that Mr. Rubio \u2019 s tax cuts , combined with his demand for increased defense spending , would bankrupt the country .\n\u201c Marco , how \u2019 s it conservative to add a trillion-dollar expenditure to the federal government ? \u201d he demanded .\nBusinesswoman Carly Fiorina , meanwhile , railed against big government , which she said was crushing American innovation . She singled out Obamacare , a tax code that is thousands of pages long , reams of federal regulations and \u201c government bureaucrats who don \u2019 t do their jobs well and are not held accountable . \u201d\nMr. Kasich repeatedly scolded his fellow candidates for what he said was a too-harsh approach that didn \u2019 t take into account real people who need the government \u2019 s aid . He said that as a second-term governor , he has learned that the chief executive needs to respond when a crisis hits .\n\u201c Philosophy doesn \u2019 t work when you run something , \u201d he said , chiding Mr. Cruz , who said as president he wouldn \u2019 t bail out banks in another financial crisis .\nMr. Kasich , though , struggled to answer when Mr. Cruz turned the question back on him , saying he would try to separate out depositors who need the money from the wealthy investors who could stand to take the hit from the bank failure .\nAt another point Mr. Trump tangled with Mr. Bush and Mrs. Fiorina over Syria and U.S. world leadership , saying he welcomed Russia \u2019 s involvement in Syria , calling the Kremling an ally in the fight against against the Islamic State .\nMr. Trump said he connected with Russian President Vladimir Putin as they waited for recent a \u201c 60 Minutes \u201d interview \u2014 prompting Mrs. Fiorina to say she \u2019 s had a \u201c private \u201d meeting with Mr. Putin and the U.S. shouldn \u2019 t even be talking to him right now , but should instead be building up troops in Europe and conducting military exercises in the region to show strength .\nThe face-off gave the candidates a last chance to solidify their positions or improve their standings in front of a national TV audience before a more than monthlong wait until the next debate Dec. 15 in Las Vegas .\nBefore Wednesday night , the race had largely stabilized , with Mr. Trump and Mr. Carson running neck and neck at the front of the pack ; Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz vying for third place ; and Mr. Bush struggling to get back into the mix .\nThe jostling at the top of the heap provoked Mr. Trump to turn his trademark sneering attacks on Mr. Carson . He joined in the rush of media outlets to challenge events from Mr. Carson \u2019 s life story as told in his 1996 autobiography \u201c Gifted Hands , \u201d which chronicled his rise from poverty in a Detroit ghetto to an acclaimed pediatric neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital .\nOne of the news reports questioned Mr. Carson \u2019 s claim that as a ninth-grader he tried to stab a classmate but the knife was deflected by the other boy \u2019 s belt buckle . The incident marked a turning point in Mr. Carson \u2019 s life , as he began working to overcome a violent temper that could have been his downfall .\nTwo hours ahead of the prime-time debate , four candidates squared off in an undercard debate , and New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie \u2014 who was kicked off the main stage because of low poll numbers \u2014 dominated the affair , blasting Mrs. Clinton for what he described as a big-government economic agenda and insisting Republicans should be fighting her , not one another .\nAt one point , he rebuked his fellow undercard candidates after a sharp exchange between former Arkansas Gov . Mike Huckabee and Louisiana Gov . Bobby Jindal over which one cut the size of state government .\n\u201c The bottom line is believe me , Hillary Clinton is coming for your wallet , everybody . Don \u2019 t worry about Huckabee or Jindal ; worry about her , \u201d Mr. Christie said .\nMr. Jindal at one point fired back at Mr. Christie , saying he has governed his state like a \u201c big-government Republican . \u201d\nMr. Christie replied that nobody in New Jersey would \u201c call me a liberal . \u201d\nFormer Sen.
