The second phase involves an intensified effort to train , advise , and equip the Iraqi Army , Kurdish Peshmerga fighters , and any Sunni tribesmen willing to fight their ISIS co-religionists . The Times reports that this second phase will begin sometime after Iraq forms a new government , which could happen this week .\nThe third , and most politically fraught phase of the campaign , according to The Times , would require airstrikes against ISIS inside Syria . Last month , the government of Bashar Assad in Damascus warned the Obama administration not to launch airstrikes against ISIS in Syria without its permission .\nObama was scheduled to outline his plan in a meeting Tuesday with House and Senate leaders before addressing the nation in a speech Wednesday , the eve of the 13th anniversary of the September 11 , 2001 , terror attacks . A senior Obama administration official told Fox News imminent , new military action in either Iraq or Syria was not expected to be announced in Wednesday 's speech . A senior White House official told Fox News that Obama 's primary aim will be to update the American public on what the strategy is to deal with the militant group , saying the administration wants `` people to understand how he 's approaching this . ''\nIn an interview that aired Sunday on NBC 's `` Meet The Press , '' Obama vowed that the United States would go `` on the offensive '' against the militants , who have seized broad swaths of territory in Syria and Iraq over the summer .\nThe interview was conducted over the weekend after the president returned from a two-day NATO summit in Wales , where the U.S. and nine of its European allies agreed to take on the militants due to the terror threat they pose . Secretary of State John Kerry is due to travel to the Middle East this month in an effort to secure the backing of Arab states for an anti-ISIS campaign , while Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel was due to arrive in Turkey on Monday to press that country 's leadership for support .
