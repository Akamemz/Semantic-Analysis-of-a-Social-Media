    "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump said he asked Saudi Arabia to significantly boost its oil production , ratcheting up pressure on Riyadh to help ease fast-rising crude prices .\nThe intervention comes as global demand is rising , inventories of stored oil are falling and a number of supply disruptions\u2014in Canada , Iran , Libya and Venezuela\u2014have tightened markets .\nOil prices ended Friday at another multiyear high . U.S. benchmark crude finished just over $ 74 a barrel , its highest since November 2014 . Brent , the global benchmark , is close to $ 80 a barrel .\nThat has contributed to rising gasoline prices , just ahead of U.S. midterm elections . Mr. Trump has targeted the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in recent months , blaming it for the higher prices .\nSaudi Arabia , the de facto head of OPEC , and Russia have already said they would work together to boost production . Producers get more revenue when prices are high but are also mindful that when they get too high , they can slow economic growth\u2014and oil demand . OPEC has also said it listened to complaints from big consuming nations , like the U.S .\nPublicly , Riyadh has committed to only modest output increases , but behind the scenes the kingdom is ramping up quickly\u2014moving from just over 10 million barrels a day a few months ago to a target of close to 11 million barrels a day by July , according to people close to the Saudi oil ministry .\nMr. Trump on Saturday said in a tweet he is asking for even more , a request that oil officials inside and outside the kingdom say would be hard for Saudi Arabia to meet on a sustainable basis .\n\u201c I am asking that Saudi Arabia increase oil production , maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels , \u201d Mr. Trump said in the tweet , citing a conversation with Saudi King Salman .\n\u201c Prices to [ sic ] high ! He has agreed ! \u201d the tweet said , citing \u201c turmoil & disfunction \u201d in Iran and Venezuela . It wasn \u2019 t clear whether Mr. Trump was saying the king agreed that prices were too high or that the kingdom would increase oil output .\nA senior Saudi official said the kingdom has made no specific promise to Mr. Trump but rather assured the U.S. of its capability to meet demand .\nOn Saturday night , about 14 hours after Mr. Trump posted his tweet , the White House put out a statement on the call between the president and King Salman , which took place Friday .\nThe statement doesn \u2019 t say that King Salman agreed to ramp up oil production or that he agreed prices were too high .\n\u201c In response to the president \u2019 s assessment of a deficit in the oil market , King Salman affirmed that the kingdom maintains a two million barrel per day spare capacity , which it will prudently use if and when necessary to ensure market balance and stability , and in coordination with its producer partners , to respond to any eventuality , \u201d the statement reads .\nSome experts said they didn \u2019 t believe the dramatic increase Mr. Trump called for was necessary . With global economic growth expected to slow in the next two years , producing more oil now could lead to another surplus , said Dean Foreman , the chief economist at the American Petroleum Institute . The previous global surplus , due in part to ramped-up U.S. shale production , pushed oil prices as low as $ 25 a barrel .\n\u201c The market doesn \u2019 t need another two million barrels a day right now , \u201d Mr. Foreman said .\nVenezuela production has dropped amid an economic crisis there . The U.S. has reimposed sanctions on Iran and earlier this week said it was asking buyers of Iranian crude to stop their purchases by November , a much sooner cutoff than expected .\nOil prices had started to fall in recent weeks , thanks to the Saudi and Russian agreement to increase production .

Ahead of the Memorial Day holiday in May , Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( D. , N.Y. ) appeared at an Exxon Mobil Corp. gas station in Washington , D.C. , and blamed Mr. Trump for high gas prices . \u201c Why doesn \u2019 t he ask them to lower their prices so that the prices at the pump can be lower ? \u201d he said .\nIn an official statement posted on the state-run Saudi Press Agency , Saudi Arabia said King Salman spoke to Mr. Trump but gave no mention of the two million barrels of extra production the American leader tweeted about .\n\u201c During the call , the two leaders stressed the need to make efforts to maintain the stability of oil markets and the growth of the global economy , \u201d it said .\nSaudi Arabia , while a close U.S. ally , has been wary of appearing to respond to specific requests to pump oil . It says it acts to balance markets , keeping prices not too high or low . It is also eager to appear to be acting in coordination with OPEC .\nIran , a fellow OPEC member , has accused Riyadh of doing Washington \u2019 s bidding .
