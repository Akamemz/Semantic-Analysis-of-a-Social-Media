Marco Rubio says the GOP `` probably went too far '' in slashing the tax burden on corporations .\nThe Florida Republican told the News-Press of Fort Myers that corporations will largely use their major tax cut to buy back shares or increase dividends to shareholders \u2014 which `` is n't going to create dramatic economic growth . ''\n`` If I were king for a day , this tax bill would have looked different . I thought we probably went too far on ( helping ) corporations , '' Rubio told the newspaper in the interview published Friday . `` By and large , you 're going to see a lot of these multinationals buy back shares to drive up the price . Some of them will be forced , because they 're sitting on historic levels of cash , to pay out dividends to shareholders . ''\n`` That is n't going to create dramatic economic growth . ( But ) there 's a lot of things in the bill that I have supported for a long time ( such as ) doubling the Child Tax Credit . And it is better \u2014 significantly better \u2014 than the current code , '' he continued .\nThe tax plan that President Donald Trump signed into law last week permanently chops the corporate tax to 21 percent from 35 percent . Republicans say the change \u2014 which starts Monday \u2014 will drive domestic investment , boost wages and fuel economic growth over time .\nAt least a dozen companies \u2014 including mammoth employers like AT & T and Boeing \u2014 announced plans to raise their minimum wages , increase capital investment or hand out employee bonuses after the plan 's passage . While Republicans have cheered those announcements , some critics of the corporate tax cut have maintained most of those benefits will likely go to shareholders rather than workers .\nRubio , who sought the 2016 GOP presidential nomination , supported both the Senate GOP 's tax bill and a joint House and Senate version that the president signed . He pushed first for a doubling of the child tax credit from $ 1,000 to $ 2,000 , then for increasing the refundable portion of that credit to $ 1,400 .\nDuring the Senate tax debate , Rubio proposed expanding the credit and paying for it by cutting the corporate tax rate by less than the GOP initially intended .",
