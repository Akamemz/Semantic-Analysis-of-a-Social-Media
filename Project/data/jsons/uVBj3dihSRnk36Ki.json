''\n`` My hope is a spirit of cooperation will move us forward over the next few hours , '' Obama said .\nThe failure of Congress to authorize spending for the new fiscal year triggered the shutdown on October 1 .\nAnother deadline looms on Thursday , when the Treasury says it will need Congress to raise the debt ceiling so it can borrow more money to pay all the government 's bills .\nDuring his visit to Martha 's Table in Washington , Obama said the congressional leaders could `` solve this problem today . ''\nHe warned that a default , in which the government would lack enough cash on hand to pay down its debt obligations as well as other daily bills such as Social Security checks , `` could have a potentially devastating effect on our economy . ''\n`` We 've already had a damaging effect on our economy because of the shutdown , '' he said . `` That damage would be greatly magnified if we do n't make sure that government 's paying its bills , and that has to be decided this week .
