Much of the strategy is driven by internal data and public polling that Pence and campaign officials have paid close attention to since last year \u2019 s midterm elections , when the Republican Party lost its grip on many higher-income suburban areas .\nThe latest \u2588\u2588\u2588/Morning Consult poll , for example , found substantially wider gaps in Trump \u2019 s favorability among registered voters ( -15 ) , suburban residents ( -14 ) and women ( -25 ) than in Pence \u2019 s ( -6 , -7 , -16 , respectively ) .\nOne former Pence aide , who accompanied the vice president to numerous rallies and campaign events in 2016 , said his folksy Midwestern charm disarmed suburban women who openly admitted to cringing at the thought of their children behaving like Trump . He has long had the same effect with white evangelical Christians , a demographic that quickly coalesced behind Trump when he tapped Pence to be his vice president , and has largely stuck by the duo ever since .\n\u201c Mike Pence has done a phenomenal job as our vice president .

He is my friend , \u201d Trump said last month on Fox News , dismissing the prospect of him dumping his vice president to add a woman to the ticket for his reelection bid .\nPeople close to Pence use phrases like \u201c polite pressure \u201d and \u201c micro-targeting \u201d when they talk about the role he will play in 2020 .

Him delivering remarks in a more intimate setting is equal to Trump speaking to a 50,000-person rally in Texas , \u201d said the person close to Trump .\nIn other words , Pence possesses the retail politicking skills and Trump possesses the star power .\nTheir alliance is both unusual and advantageous . But it \u2019 s not unlike past presidential tickets where vice presidents were chosen because of their electoral potency , not because of the wisdom or policy chops they would bring to the White House .\nPence has long appeared aware of , and willing to contribute to , this dynamic .
