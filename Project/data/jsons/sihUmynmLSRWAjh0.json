    "content": "Two more women accused Republican nominee Donald Trump of sexual assault Friday , with a relative of one of them saying that the allegation was `` an attempt to regain the spotlight . ''\nSummer Zervos , a former contestant on Trump 's NBC reality show `` The Apprentice , '' said the real estate mogul kissed her and groped her after meeting at a Beverly Hills hotel in 2007 to discuss a potential job . Zervos , accompanied at a Los Angeles press conference by attorney Gloria Allred , said she was later offered a lower-paying job at a Trump golf course .\n\u201c You do not have the right to treat women as sexual objects just because you are a star , \u201d Zervos said at the press conference , addressing Trump .\nLate Friday , the Trump campaign released a statement purporting to be from statement in which a cousin of Zervos said he was `` shocked and bewildered '' by her account .\nJohn Barry of Mission Viejo , Calif. , said in the statement that Zervos spoke glowingly of Trump until the real estate mogul rebuffed an invitation to visit her restaurant during the primary campaign .\n`` I think Summer wishes she could still be on reality TV , and in an effort to get that back she \u2019 s saying all of these negative things about Mr. Trump , '' Barry said . `` That \u2019 s not how she talked about him before . ''\nTrump himself issued a statement saying that he `` never met [ Zervos ] at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago .

''\nThe new allegations capped a tumultuous week on the campaign trail for Trump , who has faced a daily drip-drip of allegations even as he has tried to focus on Bill Clinton 's female accusers -- and the massive leak of Clinton campaign emails by WikiLeaks .\nAs Zervos was making her accusations Friday , Trump was at a rally in Greensboro , N.C. , rejecting all the allegations against him as \u201c total fiction . \u201d\n\u201c I have no idea who these women are , \u201d Trump said . \u201c The stories are total fiction .
