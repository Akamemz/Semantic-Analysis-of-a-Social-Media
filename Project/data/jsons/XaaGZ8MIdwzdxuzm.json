This nanny-state navigator corps is the Mother of all Community Organizing Boondoggles. It's also yet another Obama threat to Americans' privacy.\n\nA reminder about Secretary Sebelius' sordid snooping history is in order here. In August 2009, HHS and the White House Office of Health Reform called on their ground troops to report on fellow citizens who dared to criticize their federal health care takeover. Team Obama issued an all-points bulletin on the taxpayer-funded White House website soliciting informant emails. Remember?\n\n\"If you get an email or see something on the Web about health insurance reform that seems fishy, send it to flag@whitehouse.gov,\" the Obamacare overlords urged. The feds even singled out conservative Internet powerhouse Matt Drudge because he had featured a video compilation of Obama and other Democrats -- in their own words -- exposing the \"public option\" as a Trojan Horse for government-run health care and the elimination of private industry.\n\nTexas GOP Sen. John Cornyn protested at the time that \"these actions taken by your White House staff raise the specter of a data collection program.\" The flagging operation was shut down, but a plethora of federal disclosure exemptions protect the Obama administration from revealing what was collected, who was targeted and what was done with the database information.\n\nWhite House lapdogs dismissed the concerns of conservatives as paranoid delusions.
