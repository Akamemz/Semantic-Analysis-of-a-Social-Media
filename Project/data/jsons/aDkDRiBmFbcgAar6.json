The government , backed by victims ' rights groups , contends that the prosecution must show only that a reasonable person would interpret the Facebook posts as threats to commit bodily harm . But Elonis ' lawyer , John Elwood , told the court that the prosecution must make a far more rigorous showing .\n`` How does one prove what 's in somebody else 's mind ?
