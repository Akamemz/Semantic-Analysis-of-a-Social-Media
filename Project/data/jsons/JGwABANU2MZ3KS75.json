And the anger of substantial numbers of citizens against their elites is palpable . Brexit was a huge shock to the British political establishment and Europe as a whole . Now Prime Minister Theresa May must negotiate a tricky geopolitical divorce , disentangling United Kingdom and EU law while trying to retain as much access to European markets as possible .\nTrump \u2019 s subsequent victory was \u201c Brexit times three , \u201d according to Nigel Farage , the UK Independence Party leader and a euroskeptic .

If nothing else , Italy \u2019 s troubles starkly illustrate the widening EU split between borrower and creditor nations and Northern and Mediterranean regions .

This is what opened space for a populist discourse . \u201d\nANTONIO PARRINELLO/REUTERS Migrants wait to disembark from an Italian Coast Guard vessel in the Sicilian harbor of Catania . The continued flow of migrants into Europe has fueled nationalist movements across the Continent .\nBucks aren \u2019 t the only things behind populism \u2019 s rise , of course . There \u2019 s also identity politics . Immigration \u2013 legal , illegal , and crisis-created \u2013 is a huge issue from the US southern border to Berlin . Writing in The New York Times , former human rights lawyer Amanda Taub calls it \u201c the crisis of whiteness . \u201d\nWhiteness , in this case , means skin color and/or privilege , the right to belong to a group that \u2019 s in charge and dominates the majority culture .\nTrump appealed to people with this grievance . Think about his famous red hats . \u201c Make America Great Again \u201d \u2013 what does that really mean ? To many , it means bringing back the time when pressing \u201c 2 \u201d to hear a menu in Spanish wasn \u2019 t an option . It means more factory jobs , but it also means a time before the advent of Black Lives Matter . It means the days when city streets were full of white people in sober work clothes , not a polyglot of races and different faiths .\nTrump didn \u2019 t invent this approach . In many ways he \u2019 s just the apotheosis of the Republican Party \u2019 s so-called Southern Strategy , which dates to the days of candidate Richard Nixon . Following the passage of civil rights legislation under President Johnson , Southern working-class whites began moving en masse to the GOP . Republican candidates up to and including Ronald Reagan pushed \u201c states \u2019 rights \u201d \u2013 an issue Democrats charged was racially tinged . By the 1980s the white working-class emotional connection to the old Democratic Party , forged by F.D.R. , the New Deal , and big social programs , had effectively vanished .\nNor was Trump elected solely by white men in pickups who fly Confederate flags . He received almost 63 million votes . You don \u2019 t get that many without winning some women , some college-educated voters , and even some minorities .\nBut in the aggregate the 2016 divide along racial and gender and education lines was striking . Trump won 57 percent of whites , as opposed to the 37 percent who voted for Mrs. Clinton , CNN exit polls showed . He won 62 percent of white men , while Clinton won 31 percent . He won 71 percent of white men without a college degree , while Clinton took only 23 percent .\nThat \u2019 s right \u2013 Trump took nearly 3 out of every 4 white guys who only graduated high school , meaning they \u2019 re likely working class . If you \u2019 re looking for evidence of a US populist uprising , there it is .\nAcross the Atlantic it \u2019 s the same thing but different . Less-educated whites in European countries have a similar feeling that something is slipping away from them , but it \u2019 s rooted in unique problems . In the US , it \u2019 s illegal immigration across the southern border that \u2019 s an issue . In the EU , it \u2019 s legal migrant workers and refugees .\nIn the US , Trump vows to \u201c build the wall \u201d and to establish some sort of controls on Muslim entry into the country . In Britain , Ms. May promises that Brexit means a free flow of goods across borders but a more controlled flow of people . Even in Germany , which has accepted more than 1 million asylum-seekers in recent years , decidedly nonpopulist Chancellor Angela Merkel now says Islamic full-face veils should be banned \u201c wherever legally possible \u201d and that sharia ( Islamic law ) will never replace German justice .\nIt \u2019 s the pace of societal change that may drive these positions . In Britain the foreign-born population grew 66 percent between 2004 and 2014 . In Germany it grew 75 percent between 2011 and 2015 . In the US it \u2019 s about doubled since 1990 .\nThis rapid shift makes some whites feel their status is in doubt . English villagers committed to Brexit complained that in London they feel like strangers because of the many Asian tourists and Middle Easterners . In Louisiana rural whites told author Arlie Russell Hochschild that they feel as if they \u2019 re in a line climbing a hill to reach the American dream \u2013 but the line \u2019 s progress has stopped , as blacks and immigrants cut in front of them .\n\u201c People feel it is not their country anymore , \u201d says Mudde of the University of Georgia . \u201c To a certain extent , it is not their country anymore . \u201d\nGlobalization helps drive this sense of loss . Many workers see jobs flowing overseas and read the \u201c Made In \u201d labels on all the foreign-sourced products in Wal-Mart and Home Depot and generally feel as if the new world of free trade may be great for some people but not for them .\nThey \u2019 ve had enough . Maybe they \u2019 re not directly affected by the decline in manufacturing jobs , but they \u2019 re pessimistic about the chances for the next generation . According to Pew Research figures , more than 60 percent of voters in both the US and Europe believe their children will be worse off than they are .\n\u201c It used to be generally accepted that reducing trade barriers increases prosperity and promotes peace , benefiting investing and recipient countries and promoting international cooperation in solving problems around the world , \u201d wrote Lawrence Summers , former Treasury secretary and Charles W. Eliot University Professor at Harvard University , in a December opinion piece . \u201c Almost all of this was called into question in 2016 . \u201d\nGlobalization and the disruption it brings have indeed been a huge part of the world economy in the modern era .\nIn 1972 , when trade was dominated by a handful of industrialized countries and China was a closed economy , trade accounted for 27.1 percent of global output , according to World Bank figures . Then Nixon went to China . The Soviet Union fell . The EU morphed into the world \u2019 s largest market . China \u2013 and Vietnam and Bangladesh and India and other developing nations \u2013 ushered in a new era of rapid integration and global supply chains . In 2008 trade reached 61.1 percent of global output .\nAnd that \u2019 s where it \u2019 s stayed , more or less . Maybe that \u2019 s peak trade . Maybe the Great Recession of 2008 created a ceiling . In any case , globalization is moving sideways . We \u2019 re not in a recession \u2013 the world economy grew 2.5 percent in 2015 \u2013 but the contribution of trade to that growth isn \u2019 t going up . In 2015 global trade \u2019 s share of output actually fell to 57.7 percent .\nThat \u2019 s probably an anomaly \u2013 globalization isn \u2019 t going into reverse , says Pankaj Ghemawat , who directs the Center for the Globalization of Education and Management at New York University . But \u201c globalization is still in the doldrums , \u201d says Mr. Ghemawat via email . \u201c It is clearly not advancing like it was before the financial crisis , but it has not ( at least not yet ) collapsed . \u201d\nALY SONG/REUTERS A slide twists through a five-story mall in Shanghai , China . Beijing has encouraged more consumer spending .\nWhat \u2019 s going on ? Start in Asia , the most dynamic economic region . Its largest economy , China , is moving up the value chain . China is \u201c moving from an economy based on assembly of other people \u2019 s components to increased production of those components in China , \u201d says Robert Lawrence , a professor of international trade at Harvard University \u2019 s Kennedy School of Government .\nAt the same time , China is rebalancing its economy away from exports to domestic consumption . In 2006 , exports made up 35 percent of its total output , estimates Ghemawat . By 2015 , that had fallen to 21 percent . That matters : China is the world \u2019 s largest exporter of manufactured goods .\nOther forces have slowed globalization \u2019 s march as well . Technology and automation make it easier to produce more goods in higher-cost labor markets such as the US or EU . Digital trade is harder to measure than container ships so maybe the world is trading more goods \u2013 just not the seaborne cargoes of yesteryear . Shipping companies are going bust because there is less demand for goods to be moved across borders .\nThen there \u2019 s the increased protectionism by Group of Twenty countries , from tougher regulations on where banks hold capital to buy-local measures and other restrictions on trade . And all that was before the Brexit vote and election of Trump . That has proponents of freer trade reaching for historical analogies .\nIn 1930 , Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act , which imposed tariffs on more than 20,000 items . The result was to deepen and extend the Great Depression . \u201c Globalization could absolutely go into reverse , and it would be politics not economics that would bring that about , \u201d says Ghemawat .\nAre the populist legions thus fighting a war that is already over ? After all , the pace of economic integration has slowed . No new trade deals are being signed , and the shiny new deal in the offing , the Trans-Pacific Partnership , looks like a casualty of Trump 2016 . So those opposed to globalization are reacting to what has already happened : global flows of capital into supply chains for manufacturing consumer goods such as phones and shoes and furniture . And there \u2019 s little evidence that tariffs slapped on China \u2013 or any other perceived globalization villain \u2013 would bring back any lost jobs . Manufacturers can always move to another low-cost country , be it Bangladesh or Ethiopia .\nIf Trump truly wants to boost US employment for less-educated workers , maybe he should keep a wary eye on Amazon and its experiment with unmanned stores , or the start-up Otto and its work on self-driving trucks . Automation of retail and long-haul trucking could be huge killers of jobs decades hence .\n\u201c Trade was never the dominant reason why we saw the shrinking of manufacturing , and stopping trade certainly won \u2019 t be the solution , \u201d says Mr. Lawrence , citing the effect of automation and technology on factory productivity .\nMIKE SEGAR/REUTERS President-elect Donald Trump greets workers at a Carrier factory in Indianapolis whose executives he convinced not to move some 800 jobs from Indiana to Mexico\n2017 will pick up where 2016 leaves off , geopolitically speaking . An inaugurated Trump may proceed with his promises to build the wall , block noncitizen Muslims , and cajole US firms to keep jobs at home . ( Or not \u2013 it \u2019 s possible the unpredictable mogul will make things up as he goes along . )\nMay might start Brexit negotiations and find the EU less forgiving than her voters want . Italy will form a new government , its 63rd in the past 70 years . France will hold a presidential election in the spring . Right now Le Pen is poised to make the runoff of the top two contenders .\nIn the short run populist nationalism is likely to prosper . It is clearly sailing with the voting tide . In the long run its future depends on how it performs where it gains power . All parties have successes and failures . But today \u2019 s populists , Trump included , have made larger-than-normal claims about their ability to effect national change . That gives them , potentially , more opportunity to fall short .\nIn the US , demographic change is an upcoming variable . The electorate is becoming less white , meaning perhaps more trouble for the GOP . But voters are unpredictable \u2013 to say a blue tide of Democrats will result from this is to overstate the case .\nThe aging of voters may be more important . In many countries citizens under , say , 30 are much more accepting of diversity . In France , 77 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds think globalization is a force for good .\nIn the meantime the way issues are framed is crucial . Even individual words matter in today \u2019 s heated , Twitter-fueled world . Call someone a \u201c refugee , \u201d and they tend to get a sympathetic hearing from most Europeans , points out Mudde . Call them a \u201c migrant , \u201d and more hackles rise .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .

There\u2019s also identity politics. Immigration \u2013 legal, illegal, and crisis-created \u2013 is a huge issue from the US southern border to Berlin.

In the EU, it\u2019s legal migrant workers and refugees.\n\nIn the US, Trump vows to \u201cbuild the wall\u201d and to establish some sort of controls on Muslim entry into the country. In Britain, Ms. May promises that Brexit means a free flow of goods across borders but a more controlled flow of people. Even in Germany, which has accepted more than 1 million asylum-seekers in recent years, decidedly nonpopulist Chancellor Angela Merkel now says Islamic full-face veils should be banned \u201cwherever legally possible\u201d and that sharia (Islamic law) will never replace German justice.\n\nIt\u2019s the pace of societal change that may drive these positions. In Britain the foreign-born population grew 66 percent between 2004 and 2014. In Germany it grew 75 percent between 2011 and 2015. In the US it\u2019s about doubled since 1990.\n\nThis rapid shift makes some whites feel their status is in doubt. English villagers committed to Brexit complained that in London they feel like strangers because of the many Asian tourists and Middle Easterners. In Louisiana rural whites told author Arlie Russell Hochschild that they feel as if they\u2019re in a line climbing a hill to reach the American dream \u2013 but the line\u2019s progress has stopped, as blacks and immigrants cut in front of them.\n\n\u201cPeople feel it is not their country anymore,\u201d says Mudde of the University of Georgia. \u201cTo a certain extent, it is not their country anymore.\u201d\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nGlobalization helps drive this sense of loss. Many workers see jobs flowing overseas and read the \u201cMade In\u201d labels on all the foreign-sourced products in Wal-Mart and Home Depot and generally feel as if the new world of free trade may be great for some people but not for them.\n\nThey\u2019ve had enough. Maybe they\u2019re not directly affected by the decline in manufacturing jobs, but they\u2019re pessimistic about the chances for the next generation. According to Pew Research figures, more than 60 percent of voters in both the US and Europe believe their children will be worse off than they are.\n\n\u201cIt used to be generally accepted that reducing trade barriers increases prosperity and promotes peace, benefiting investing and recipient countries and promoting international cooperation in solving problems around the world,\u201d wrote Lawrence Summers, former Treasury secretary and Charles W. Eliot University Professor at Harvard University, in a December opinion piece. \u201cAlmost all of this was called into question in 2016.\u201d\n\nGlobalization and the disruption it brings have indeed been a huge part of the world economy in the modern era.\n\nIn 1972, when trade was dominated by a handful of industrialized countries and China was a closed economy, trade accounted for 27.1 percent of global output, according to World Bank figures. Then Nixon went to China. The Soviet Union fell. The EU morphed into the world\u2019s largest market. China \u2013 and Vietnam and Bangladesh and India and other developing nations \u2013 ushered in a new era of rapid integration and global supply chains. In 2008 trade reached 61.1 percent of global output.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where it\u2019s stayed, more or less. Maybe that\u2019s peak trade. Maybe the Great Recession of 2008 created a ceiling. In any case, globalization is moving sideways. We\u2019re not in a recession \u2013 the world economy grew 2.5 percent in 2015 \u2013 but the contribution of trade to that growth isn\u2019t going up. In 2015 global trade\u2019s share of output actually fell to 57.7 percent.\n\nThat\u2019s probably an anomaly \u2013 globalization isn\u2019t going into reverse, says Pankaj Ghemawat, who directs the Center for the Globalization of Education and Management at New York University. But \u201cglobalization is still in the doldrums,\u201d says Mr. Ghemawat via email. \u201cIt is clearly not advancing like it was before the financial crisis, but it has not (at least not yet) collapsed.\u201d\n\nALY SONG/REUTERS A slide twists through a five-story mall in Shanghai, China. Beijing has encouraged more consumer spending.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on? Start in Asia, the most dynamic economic region. Its largest economy, China, is moving up the value chain. China is \u201cmoving from an economy based on assembly of other people\u2019s components to increased production of those components in China,\u201d says Robert Lawrence, a professor of international trade at Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government.\n\nAt the same time, China is rebalancing its economy away from exports to domestic consumption. In 2006, exports made up 35 percent of its total output, estimates Ghemawat. By 2015, that had fallen to 21 percent. That matters: China is the world\u2019s largest exporter of manufactured goods.\n\nOther forces have slowed globalization\u2019s march as well. Technology and automation make it easier to produce more goods in higher-cost labor markets such as the US or EU. Digital trade is harder to measure than container ships so maybe the world is trading more goods \u2013 just not the seaborne cargoes of yesteryear. Shipping companies are going bust because there is less demand for goods to be moved across borders.\n\nThen there\u2019s the increased protectionism by Group of Twenty countries, from tougher regulations on where banks hold capital to buy-local measures and other restrictions on trade. And all that was before the Brexit vote and election of Trump. That has proponents of freer trade reaching for historical analogies.\n\nIn 1930, Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which imposed tariffs on more than 20,000 items. The result was to deepen and extend the Great Depression. \u201cGlobalization could absolutely go into reverse, and it would be politics not economics that would bring that about,\u201d says Ghemawat.\n\nAre the populist legions thus fighting a war that is already over? After all, the pace of economic integration has slowed. No new trade deals are being signed, and the shiny new deal in the offing, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, looks like a casualty of Trump 2016. So those opposed to globalization are reacting to what has already happened: global flows of capital into supply chains for manufacturing consumer goods such as phones and shoes and furniture. And there\u2019s little evidence that tariffs slapped on China \u2013 or any other perceived globalization villain \u2013 would bring back any lost jobs. Manufacturers can always move to another low-cost country, be it Bangladesh or Ethiopia.\n\nIf Trump truly wants to boost US employment for less-educated workers, maybe he should keep a wary eye on Amazon and its experiment with unmanned stores, or the start-up Otto and its work on self-driving trucks. Automation of retail and long-haul trucking could be huge killers of jobs decades hence.\n\n\u201cTrade was never the dominant reason why we saw the shrinking of manufacturing, and stopping trade certainly won\u2019t be the solution,\u201d says Mr. Lawrence, citing the effect of automation and technology on factory productivity.\n\nMIKE SEGAR/REUTERS President-elect Donald Trump greets workers at a Carrier factory in Indianapolis whose executives he convinced not to move some 800 jobs from Indiana to Mexico\n\n2017 will pick up where 2016 leaves off, geopolitically speaking. An inaugurated Trump may proceed with his promises to build the wall, block noncitizen Muslims, and cajole US firms to keep jobs at home. (Or not \u2013 it\u2019s possible the unpredictable mogul will make things up as he goes along.)\n\nMay might start Brexit negotiations and find the EU less forgiving than her voters want. Italy will form a new government, its 63rd in the past 70 years. France will hold a presidential election in the spring. Right now Le Pen is poised to make the runoff of the top two contenders.\n\nIn the short run populist nationalism is likely to prosper. It is clearly sailing with the voting tide. In the long run its future depends on how it performs where it gains power. All parties have successes and failures. But today\u2019s populists, Trump included, have made larger-than-normal claims about their ability to effect national change. That gives them, potentially, more opportunity to fall short.\n\nIn the US, demographic change is an upcoming variable. The electorate is becoming less white, meaning perhaps more trouble for the GOP. But voters are unpredictable \u2013 to say a blue tide of Democrats will result from this is to overstate the case.\n\nThe aging of voters may be more important. In many countries citizens under, say, 30 are much more accepting of diversity. In France, 77 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds think globalization is a force for good.\n\nIn the meantime the way issues are framed is crucial. Even individual words matter in today\u2019s heated, Twitter-fueled world. Call someone a \u201crefugee,\u201d and they tend to get a sympathetic hearing from most Europeans, points out Mudde. Call them a \u201cmigrant,\u201d and more hackles rise.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.
