As a white man , with all the privilege that implies , I ca n't even begin to imagine the toll that constant exposure to racism , from minor slights to full-blown discrimination , must take on its victims .\nBut while the museum will appropriately highlight our sins and failures , it will also tell a uniquely American story of triumph over adversity .
