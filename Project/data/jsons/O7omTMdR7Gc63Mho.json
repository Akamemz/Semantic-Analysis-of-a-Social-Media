These claims are false and fueled by conspiracy theories.\n\nReuters Fact Check. REUTERS/Axel Schmidt\n\nThe theory went viral after it emerged on the r/conspiracy section of Reddit on July 9 ( here ), with an allegation that the very high prices of several furniture items listed on Wayfair\u2019s marketplace and their peculiar names were the evidence of a child trafficking operation. By Friday July 10, the topic was trending on Twitter in the U.S.\n\nOne post on Twitter, for example, said that social media users were suspecting that Wayfair was selling people in cabinets, given the price range and the fact that the items had \u201call female names\u201d, some of them matching the names of reportedly missing persons ( here ). Other examples of the claim are visible here , here and here .\n\nITEM PRICING\n\nIn most iterations of this claim, the very high price of Wayfair\u2019s items provided social media users with reason for suspicion. The posts point to a series of items, including cabinets and pillows, listed for sale in a range of ten to fifteen thousand dollars.\n\nWayfair provided Reuters with the following statement, denying the allegations levied against the company and clarifying some of the reasons behind their pricing: \u201cThere is, of course, no truth to these claims. The products in question are industrial grade cabinets that are accurately priced. Recognizing that the photos and descriptions provided by the supplier did not adequately explain the high price point, we have temporarily removed the products from site to rename them and to provide a more in-depth description and photos that accurately depict the product to clarify the price point.\u201d\n\nWhile this price range is unusual for Wayfair\u2019s home use items, the company also sells larger items for business and commercial use. Wayfair told Reuters by phone that the higher pricing reflects the larger sizing for these items as well as the shipping costs associated for items this big (designed for restaurants, industrial plants, etc).\n\nNAMES\n\nMany instances of the post made the claim that the names of the cabinets coincided with the name of children that had gone missing.\n\nOne social media post, for example, suggested that an apparent news report about a missing teenager named Samiyah Mumin was linked to a cabinet named \u201cSamiyah\u201d, with a listed price of $12,899.99 ( here ).\n\nOn Facebook, Mumin herself denounced the conspiracy theories for taking attention away from children who are actually missing. \u201cY\u2019all know how many people is actually missing?
