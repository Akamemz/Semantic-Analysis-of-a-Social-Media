It argues that the agency \u2019 s decision \u201c completely upended \u201d the university \u2019 s reopening plans for the upcoming semester .\nICE notified colleges Monday that international students will be forced to leave the U.S. or transfer to another college if their schools operate entirely online this fall . New visas will not be issued to students at those schools , and others at universities offering a mix of online and in-person classes will be barred from taking all of their classes online .\nThe guidance says international students won \u2019 t be exempt even if an outbreak forces their schools online during the fall term .\nHarvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have also filed a lawsuit to prevent federal immigration authorities from enforcing the rule . Neither school plans to offer in-person classes this fall .\nThe school has plans for hybrid semesters with a mix of in-person and online classes .
