    "content": "There \u2019 s an old legal saying that goes , \u201c Hard cases make bad law. \u201d Essentially , what that means is that when you try to take an extreme case and use it as the basis for general laws , the end product doesn \u2019 t work very well . In this case , when you try to take the most sympathetic group of illegal aliens and craft a law around them , it \u2019 s going to create a huge mess . Setting aside the fact that illegals of any age are breaking the law and that could be the entire list 1-5 , there are a number of other reasons that young illegal aliens should not be allowed to stay .\n1 ) The \u201c Dreamers \u201d are mostly adults , not children or teens . Many people seem to believe \u201c Dreamers \u201d are little kids . Actually , only 22 % of them are even below the age of 25 according to the Department of Homeland Security . Moreover , there are \u201c Dreamers \u201d as old as THIRTY SIX eligible under the largely unverifiable requirements of the program . So we \u2019 re not talking about kids and we \u2019 re not talking about children . In some cases we \u2019 re talking about people who \u2019 ve spent more than a decade knowingly breaking our immigration laws as adults . Why would we want to give amnesty to someone like that ?\n2 ) Kids get punished for things their parents do all the time . If mom and dad sneak their kid into a waterpark without paying , they ALL get kicked out at the same time . Why should it be any different with our country ? If an American man commits an armed robbery , he doesn \u2019 t get to avoid jail time because there \u2019 s a kid at home who will be deprived of his daddy . If mom is an alcoholic , dad refuses to work or both of them are weirdos who think little Sally needs to have gender reassignment surgery because she likes to play with trucks , the kids suffer . This is life and the idea that the government can fix every mistake parents make with their kids is unworkable and foolish . That \u2019 s doubly true when you \u2019 re talking about adults . Americans typically don \u2019 t get a pass for breaking the law when they \u2019 re adults because mommy and daddy weren \u2019 t good parents when they were kids . \u201c Dreamers \u201d shouldn \u2019 t get one either .\n3 ) Republicans are giving up on making a real deal before they \u2019 ve even started . I am adamantly against illegal immigration and think it would be a huge mistake to legalize \u201c Dreamers. \u201d Unfortunately , the GOP seems hell-bent on doing it no matter what conservatives think . Theoretically this might make sense because since this is a group of people Democrats care about desperately , it \u2019 s the best chance we \u2019 ll ever have to actually get them to cooperate on serious anti-immigration measures . At a minimum , we should ask for funding of a wall , taking E-Verify national as well as a merit-based immigration system and tough anti-illegal immigration measures before \u201c Dreamers \u201d get legal status , not citizenship . Getting even half of that would be something the GOP could brag about after years of failure on the issue .\nUnfortunately , Donald Trump has already confirmed that he \u2019 s not going to demand a wall in return for \u201c Dreamers. \u201d Worse yet , he \u2019 s said that he \u2019 ll take care of the \u201c Dreamers \u201d no matter what already amnesty loving Republicans like John McCain and Paul Ryan do in Congress . In other words , even though this is the best chance Republicans will ever have to come to an agreement on immigration , they \u2019 ve given away all of their leverage before they \u2019 ve even gotten started . What that means is we \u2019 re likely to see the GOP get some minor face-saving security measures while the Democrats will get whatever they want in return ( which will certainly mean bringing in a lot more illegals than are currently included under DACA ) . Granted , Trump being Trump , might change his mind and decide to play hardball on the issue , but at the moment it looks like another typical \u201c bipartisan \u201d deal is in the works that will end up with liberal Democrats getting 90 % of what they want while people who believe in putting Americans first get the shaft .\n4 ) Many of the \u201c Dreamers \u201d are not who you think they are . If you listen to the way young illegals are described in the press , you \u2019 d think they are all 11 year olds who were brought here when they were three or young geniuses acing college .\nHowever , \u201c Dreamers \u201d are much less educated than American kids . Twenty one percent drop out of high school , compared to 5.9 % of American kids . Twenty two percent of those of age have bachelor \u2019 s degrees , compared to 32 % of Americans .\nSome of them aren \u2019 t all that young either . The cutoff for DACA was 31 years of age on June 15 , 2012 . In other words , there are 36 year old \u201c Dreamers \u201d who \u2019 d be eligible for permanent residence \u2013 if they \u2019 re not even older . When people are here illegally , without documentation , how do you really know their age ? How do you know they arrived here before they were 16 ( which is a DACA requirement ) ? It \u2019 s not shocking that some estimates put the level of fraud in the program as high as 50 % .\nOn top of all that , eligible illegals can be high school drop outs , have up to two misdemeanor convictions and are not required to speak English . Do any of those groups sound like people we should want living here long term ?\n5 ) It will encourage more illegals to bring their kids here . When you reward lawbreaking with amnesty , you get more lawbreaking . When Obama announced his DACA policy , a surge of illegal children came over the border . The same thing would happen again if we legalize young illegals , except it would be much more sustained . After all , if we \u2019 re actually changing the law so that young illegals will get to stay , why wouldn \u2019 t every illegal bring his kid ? That \u2019 s especially true since we have an immigration system that rewards family ties , not merit . Bring the kid over today and even if you are kicked out now , he \u2019 ll get to stay and bring you in later .\nBesides , is there anyone who believes we can ignore the law this time , but then 10 years from now kick millions of illegals out of the country who supposedly came here as children ? It \u2019 s not going to happen because we \u2019 re setting a precedent for ignoring the law in this situation . Either we \u2019 re going to enforce the law or we \u2019 re going to have this exact same problem down the road , except even worse . Ronald Reagan was suckered into a \u201c one-time \u201d amnesty in return for promises of security that were never delivered . How can Republicans in Congress be so stupid as to learn nothing from his example ? Fool us once , shame on you . Fool us twice , shame on us .",
