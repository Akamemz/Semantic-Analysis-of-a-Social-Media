But when it comes to the president \u2019 s priorities and the nationalist-populist style of politics he represents , Trump and the Republican Congress could not be farther apart .\nTrump won the nomination and the presidency after distinguishing himself from the party in four ways . Since Ronald Reagan , Republicans have tended to support global economic integration , immigration , democratic internationalism , and entitlement reform . And yet Trump opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership , called to renegotiate NAFTA , and wanted tariffs on China . His 2015 immigration plan championed a wall across the southern border , workplace enforcement , an end to birthright citizenship , and a tripling of border and customs agents . He repudiated the Iraq war and questioned the future of NATO . He swore that Social Security and Medicare would be off-limits . His brashness , colorfulness , insults , willingness to transgress norms , humor , novelty , and lack of political experience separated him from the GOP pack .\nThis program and its avatar won three Great Lakes states that had been missing from the Republican column for a generation . Trump also came within striking distance in Minnesota and New Hampshire . Obviously , we do not know the exact relation between Trump \u2019 s nationalism and populism and the roughly 78,000 votes in three states that gave him an Electoral College victory . But the unexpected shape of his upset suggests that the trademark Trump issues of immigration , trade , nonintervention , and retirement security played some role both in attracting support for him and depressing turnout for Hillary Clinton .\nYet the 16 months since the election have seen the gradual , fitful , and partial regularization of Trump into the GOP that predated and opposed him . Until recently , the president and congressional leadership were aligned : They seated a justice and lower-court judges , rolled back Obama-era regulations , failed to repeal and replace Obamacare , and passed a large tax cut . Trump \u2019 s foreign policy also became more conventionally Republican . He bombed Syria , turned down his criticism of NATO , maintained a troop presence in Afghanistan despite his instincts to withdraw , and increased defense spending . The signature Trump policies \u2014 including the travel ban , exit from the TPP and the Paris Climate Accord , and moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem \u2014 were greeted with friendly skepticism from party elites .

Instead , both Trump and the GOP seem to be reverting to form : Trump has pressed for changes to legal immigration , visited prototypes for the border wall , called for the death penalty for opioid dealers , and imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as against China , amid anxiety and dissent and resistance from congressmen of his own party . Trump \u2019 s instincts and impulsiveness have driven him to re-embrace the portfolio that delivered his electoral coalition at the very moment Republicans in Congress want nothing so much as to return to their districts , publicize the tax cut , and vainly attempt to divorce their campaigns from national politics .
