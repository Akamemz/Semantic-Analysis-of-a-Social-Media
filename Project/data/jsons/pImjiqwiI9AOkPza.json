Veteran Republicans loathe the plan , arguing it further fillets the minority party \u2019 s rights beyond current rules that eliminated the filibuster for most presidential nominees . Republicans also face the possibility of losing the Senate in 2016 and they fret about voters giving the confirmation keys to a President Hillary Clinton , who they fear would install liberal judges .\nGiven Republicans \u2019 insistence that any changes to the Senate \u2019 s byzantine rules require the support of 67 senators , it \u2019 s impossible to envision the filibuster disappearing anytime soon on Supreme Court nominees .\nIndeed , senators were much quicker to pan the proposal than praise it .\n\u201c I certainly would not support further limiting the rights of senators , \u201d said moderate GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine .\n\u201c It \u2019 d be a serious mistake , \u201d said Sen. Debbie Stabenow ( D-Mich. ) . \u201c We chose not to do that because it was the highest court in the land . \u201d\nAsked if Democrats \u2019 opposition centered solely around abortion rights , Stabenow said her concern goes even further around a court that routinely makes big decisions on everything from health care to gay marriage to voting rights .\n\u201c Lots of worries . Lots of worries , \u201d she said , shaking her head .\nThe idea of ending the filibuster on all presidential nominees is rooted in the institution of the Senate , where since 2003 the practice of requiring 60 votes on nominees became an increasingly popular tool used by the minority party to stop or slow the president \u2019 s nominees . But if the filibuster were further gutted , the prizes at stake in 2016 would increase beyond the comfort level of senators in both parties : If one party wins both the White House and the Senate , the minority would lose any sway over the Supreme Court process and could be forced to swallow ideological nominees if any vacancies arise .\nThat might be too much for either Democrats or Republicans to bear . Members of both parties this week argued that eliminating the filibuster on Supreme Court nominees would only boost the prospects for rigidly partisan nominees from the left or the right , depending on which party comes out the winner in next year \u2019 s elections .\n\u201c You \u2019 re going to ruin the judiciary over time , \u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-S.C. ) , who wants all nominees subject to a 60-vote threshold . \u201c I like the idea of having to reach across the aisle . \u2019 Cause what you \u2019 re doing is you \u2019 re turning judicial appointments over to the hardest of the hard within each caucus . \u201d\nFacing staunch opposition to confirmation of several high-level judges to the D.C . Circuit Court of Appeals , Senate Democrats changed the filibuster rules in 2013 to allow unilateral confirmation of almost all presidential nominees via the \u201c nuclear option \u201d \u2014 a simple majority of Democrats . But Democrats left the filibuster untouched for the Supreme Court , mostly because of their worries about anti-abortion justices winning future confirmation .\nSome Republicans are hoping to start fresh this year and simply end the filibuster on all nominees for good , eliminating the possibility of either party changing the rules to their liking whenever they have the majority . GOP Sens . Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Mike Lee of Utah have developed a proposal they say does just that and their plan is , for now , moving forward .\nSenate Rules Committee Chairman Roy Blunt ( R-Mo . ) said on Tuesday that his panel will vote later this year on the filibuster reforms suggested by Alexander and Lee and allow it to be amended by other senators on the Rules Committee . The proposal could make it through committee , though some Democrats suggested it would do so on a party-line vote given queasiness in their party over the Supreme Court provision .\nAlexander privately shared his plan with Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York , the top Democrat on the Rules Committee and No . 3 in his party leadership . The two men have consistently worked as back-channel negotiators between their two bitterly divided caucuses , but Schumer was not enthused about the Tennessean \u2019 s suggested changes .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a nonstarter for most Democrats , \u201d Schumer said . \u201c I love Lamar , but when he first showed it to me , I said : \u2018 How can we do this for Supreme Court ? \u2019 \u201d\nAlexander did not seem dissuaded by the bipartisan opposition to his plan .\nThe argument from Blunt and Alexander is they are simply trying to finalize what had been tradition since the birth of the Senate : not using filibusters on nominations .
