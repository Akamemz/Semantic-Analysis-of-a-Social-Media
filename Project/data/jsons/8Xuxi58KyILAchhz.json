    "content": "The Obama administration 's new rules to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions from existing power plants have helped propel the United States to a leadership role in international efforts to curb global warming , some analysts suggest .\nMonday 's announcement of President Obama \u2019 s Clean Power Plan is being seen as a significant step forward for the US and for the international process .\n`` This is a case of leading by example , '' says Elliot Diringer , executive vice president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions , a climate- and energy-policy think tank in Arlington , Va. `` The rest of the world has been waiting a long time for the US to demonstrate the kind of leadership we 're seeing now . ''\nThe plan adds to the US 's diplomatic credibility on climate , adds Andrew Deutz , director of international government relations for The Nature Conservancy . And that is as significant as the emissions goals , he suggests .\nBut how strict are the emissions goals themselves ? Is the US on the verge of becoming a world leader in cutting carbon emissions ?\nThere \u2019 s no easy way to compare the climate efforts of different nations , specialists say , because negotiators working on a Paris treaty are taking a `` pledge and review '' approach . Each country chooses its own targets , based on a range of factors .\nThe Clean Power Plan aims to cut CO2 emissions from existing power plants to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 . It is part of a broader Obama administration plan to cut carbon emissions economy-wide . The goal for that broader plan is to reduce all CO2 emissions to between 26 and 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 .\nThe European Union , by contrast , aims to cut emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels \u2013 a more-aggressive target \u2013 by 2030 . Some European countries not in the EU , such as Norway and Iceland , aim to at least match the EU targets . Switzerland aims for 50 percent cuts .\nMeanwhile , China , Canada , New Zealand , Japan , and Singapore are using 2005 as the base year for their targets , like the US . Canada , New Zealand , and Japan have proposed emissions cuts of 25 to 30 percent by 2030 . China and Singapore have pledged to significantly reduce their carbon intensity \u2013 the amount of carbon produced per unit of gross domestic product . Their goal is to see that their emissions peak by 2030 .\nStill others , such as Mexico , South Korea , Ethiopia , and Morocco , have set another , even softer baseline , offering to cut emissions between 32 and 64 percent , compared with what their emissions might have been in 2030 if emissions followed a `` business as usual '' path .\nOf particular interest are India , Indonesia , Brazil , and South Africa , which have yet to submit plans , notes David Waskow , who heads the international climate initiative at the World Resources Institute in Washington . Along with China , these countries fall into a category of newly industrialized nations whose economic aspirations could lead to troubling emissions paths .\n`` People have tried to devise all sorts of formulas to suggest what an equitable distribution of effort would be , '' says Mr. Diringer . So far , none has stuck .\nStill , Monday 's announcement gives the US fresh credibility in dealing with climate change . This new credibility first emerged last November , says Mr. Deutz , when Mr. Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping jointly announced their national offerings toward a new global climate pact during a summit in Beijing . For its part , China committed to capping emissions by 2030 , with renewable energy sources accounting for 20 percent of the country 's generating capacity . The country also would reduce its carbon intensity by 60 to 65 percent by 2030 .\n`` That did a couple of things , '' Deutz says . `` It put the US out there with a significant , credible target . It demonstrated that China was prepared to commit to an international target as well . And the fact that the US and China were moving together helped to unlock the negotiating space . ''\nThat played out in interesting ways a month later at global climate talks in Lima , Peru .\n`` Suddenly the US became a credible , positive force in the negotiations , getting a lot more respect than it had previously , '' he says . `` It also meant that some countries that were hiding behind the US could n't do that , and they were exposed .
