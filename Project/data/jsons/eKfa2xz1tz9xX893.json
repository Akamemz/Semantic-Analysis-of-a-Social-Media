The Lone Star State has the biggest cache -- 222 Democratic delegates and 155 for Republicans .\nAnd perhaps no candidate is fighting harder for that prize than Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz .

Cruz has maintained a polling lead in the state , but knows a surprise loss there could doom his campaign .\nFor Republicans , the second-biggest prize is Georgia , with 76 delegates at stake . Both Trump and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio put in face time with voters Monday in the final hours before polls open , while Cruz stayed rooted in Texas .\nOn the Democratic side , too , Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have focused their efforts .\nWhile Clinton declared Saturday night after her decisive win in the South Carolina primary that the campaign was going \u201c national , \u201d the former secretary of state was concentrating Monday on two delegate-heavy states -- the Democratic-stronghold of Massachusetts ( 91 delegates ) and Virginia ( 95 delegates ) .\nSolid wins there and beyond on Super Tuesday could give her a nearly insurmountable delegate count toward the nomination .\nClinton to date leads Sanders in the delegate count 543-to-85 , including so-called superdelegates . They will compete for 865 delegates on Tuesday and a total of roughly 1,800 delegates over the next two weeks , with 2,382 needed to win the nomination .\nThe delegates on the line in 11 states Tuesday represent a third of those needed to clinch the party nod .\nAnd on the GOP side , 595 delegates are on the line Tuesday across 11 states -- nearly half the number needed to secure the nomination .\nSanders is focusing on Minnesota and Colorado , progressive states where he hopes his message of social and economic equality will translate into votes .\n\u201c Americans don \u2019 t need crumbs , they need the whole loaf , \u201d Sanders said at a rally in Minneapolis .\nHe is expected on Tuesday to win his home state of Vermont , which has 16 Democratic delegates .
