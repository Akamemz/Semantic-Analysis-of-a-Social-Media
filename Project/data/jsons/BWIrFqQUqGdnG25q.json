    "content_original": "On MSNBC's Morning Joe, liberal co-host Mika Brzezinski had an interesting reaction to a correspondent's report regarding the ongoing war of words between President Trump and Hillary Clinton. The NBC News reporter played audio of Mrs. Clinton attacking Trump as a sexual predator, then quoted from the president's tweet firing back at his defeated opponent's conspiratorial sore-loserdom. Brzezinski marveled at Clinton's self-unawareness, apologizing -- then instantly withdrawing the apology -- as she urged the former first lady to \"stop talking about this topic unless Bill Clinton wants to come forward and apologize.\" Watch:\n\n\u201cI think the hold that the Clintons had on the Democratic is over,\u201d she said. \u201cI think people are feeling like they finally can speak their minds about it all, but they didn\u2019t for a long time.\u201d Well yeah, but the idea is that they only feel free to 'speak their minds' now because the Clinton era is over, and there's very little to lose at this point. Brzezinski also went after New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, one of the elected Democrats who have abruptly decided -- years after the fact, and long after she needed to feel \"honored\" by his support -- that Bill Clinton's multiple accusers deserve to be believed: \"One of the reasons why we, and I mean me and Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrats, lost is because Bill Clinton\u2019s behavior was accepted. It was pushed under the rug and even women defended him...I know but he continues to flourish today and his wife ran for president even though these women who accused him were attacked in the media, were maligned or settled.
