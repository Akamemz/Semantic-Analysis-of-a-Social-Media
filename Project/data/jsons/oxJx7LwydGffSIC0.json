In the Georgia Sixth to replace Tom Price and the Ohio 12th to replace Pat Tiberi in particular , Democrats outperformed the district \u2019 s partisan lean and its Republican voting history but still couldn \u2019 t find quite enough votes to win .\nFor every Pennsylvania 18th , the site of Conor Lamb \u2019 s stunning win in a district Donald Trump had won by 18 points , there is an Arizona Eighth . Democrat Hiral Tipirneni came within 3 points of beating Republican Debbie Lesko in a district Trump won by 23 .\nSo Democrats came much closer than you \u2019 d think to winning a coveted House seat . But they still lost . They \u2019 ve actually lost a lot over the past two years , including in the Ohio 12th special election last month . Of course , Republicans haven \u2019 t really been impressive either , as they scrape by in what were supposed to be solid GOP districts .\nRepublicans deserve credit for hanging on here . But I 've never seen one party go 8/9 in consecutive House special elections this unimpressively . # OH12 \u2014 Dave Wasserman ( @ Redistrict ) August 8 , 2018\nBut to state the overly obvious , you have to actually win in close elections to take at least 218 seats and control of the House . While these special elections are often held up as proof that a blue wave is building , they remind us exactly how big that wave has to be . Republicans have successfully gerrymandered House districts across the country expressly for this purpose : surviving a year of strong Democratic enthusiasm .\nThis year might be the first when those maps are really put to the test \u2014 but in a few choice cases already , the strong Republican fundamentals have held up . If they can swing just a few seats in November , that might be enough for the GOP to hold on to the House .\nThe worst fears for Democrats in the 2018 midterms , explained\nThe special elections in the Georgia Sixth , where Democrat Jon Ossoff lost to Republican Karen Handel last April , and in the Ohio 12th , where Democrat Danny O \u2019 Connor fell short against Republican Troy Balderson in August , represent two distinct danger zones for Democrats .\nThe Georgia race typified a district that swung dramatically toward Democrats in the 2016 presidential election . Mitt Romney beat Barack Obama by more than 20 points in the Sixth in 2012 , but Trump barely edged out Hillary Clinton , winning the district by less than 2 points .\nThat swing and strong fundraising by Ossoff gave Democrats hope they could flip the seat after Tom Price vacated his seat to become Trump \u2019 s health secretary . Forecasters rated the special election a toss-up . But while the Sixth continued its swing toward Democrats \u2014 Price won his last reelection in 2016 by 24 points , and Handel beat Ossoff by just 3.5 \u2014 it wasn \u2019 t enough to overcome the district \u2019 s red bent .\nThe Ohio 12th represents a different kind of challenge . The district didn \u2019 t swing at all in 2016 ( Romney beat Obama by 10 points , Trump beat Clinton by 11 ) , but the demographics of the district promised to make it more competitive .

Other special elections have been more competitive thanks to diverse electorates \u2014 the Arizona Eighth and the South Carolina Fifth , a Trump+18 district that Republicans won by just 3 points last summer \u2014 but the GOP-leaning nature of the district won out .\nThe fear for Democrats , in other words , is \u201c you don \u2019 t get close enough to win in those high-educated districts and the Obama-to-Trump places don \u2019 t bounce back enough , \u201d Kyle Kondik at the University of Virginia \u2019 s Crystal Ball told me in an email . \u201c So you get squeezed at both ends , basically . \u201d\nDemocrats have been playing in pretty difficult territory : The Georgia Sixth is R+8 , according to Cook Political Report , which means it \u2019 s 8 points more Republican than the rest of the United States ; the Ohio 12th , Arizona Eighth , and South Carolina Fifth are all R+7 or worse for Democrats . So close calls on that kind of turf can certainly be seen as encouraging for the minority .\nBut Democrats will probably need to take some R+7 districts to win the 24 seats they need to flip the House .
