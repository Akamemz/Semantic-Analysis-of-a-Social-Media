At least that\u2019s how the president was feeling on Christmas Eve, according to his own Twitter account. \u201cI am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security,\u201d he proclaimed. \u201cAt some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our Country more money than the Border Wall we are all talking about.
