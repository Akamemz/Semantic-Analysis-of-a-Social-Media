But as groups like Operation Rescue and Americans United for Life run out of deep red states with eager , Republican-controlled legislatures to target , it may become increasingly relevant -- and common .\nLegislators in Texas and Oklahoma seem to have made a sport of passing increasingly draconian abortion restrictions , but New Mexico \u2019 s Democratic-controlled Legislature has been incredibly successful at rejecting such measures . If a current ballot initiative to criminalize abortion at 20 weeks passes with Albuquerque voters , it will be the only restriction on the procedure anywhere in the state .

They never make it to the floor , \u201d she continued . \u201c As a way to bypass the Legislature , which refuses to hear the voices of the people , we decided to launch an initiative at the city level . \u201d\nBut whether the ballot initiative represents the voice of the people of Albuquerque is a subject of considerable debate .\nA large number of the people working with the Shavers are out-of-state volunteers , some as young as 16 and 17 years old , brought in by fringe militant groups like Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust and Operation Rescue .\nOne signature-gathering demonstration , which took place outside the city \u2019 s Holocaust and Intolerance Museum among signs that read \u201c American Auschwitz , \u201d was staffed largely by young people who had been bused in that day from California .\nAsked by a local news station what they knew about abortion rights in New Mexico and in Albuquerque specifically , one young protester sheepishly admitted , \u201c Since I just got here , we \u2019 ve been learning about it since then , so I don \u2019 t know too much . \u201d\nThe outsider-insider dynamic has not escaped some residents \u2019 notice , and Cadena is quick to point out that the Shavers ' views on abortion do not reflect what she sees as her home state \u2019 s core values .
