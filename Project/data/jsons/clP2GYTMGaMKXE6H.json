These tragedies must end , and to end them , we must change , '' Obama said . He said `` no set of laws can eliminate evil from the world ... but that ca n't be an excuse for inaction . ''\nThe calls for new national gun control measures emerged swiftly after reports first surfaced Friday of the shooting that claimed 26 lives , in addition to that of the gunman .\nAt the same time , the case is still being investigated and it 's unclear whether any gun control legislation could have prevented the tragedy . While some are calling for new gun laws , there is also a growing call to examine , comprehensively , the culture in America that is producing these shocking bursts of violence .\nSen. Joe Lieberman , I-Conn. , on `` Fox News Sunday , '' called for a `` national commission '' looking at `` violence and the entertainment culture '' -- at video games , at movies , and asking whether they are causing `` vulnerable young men , particularly , to be more violent . ''\nDurbin , though , was also among those calling for new scrutiny of America 's gun policy .\nWhile typically those calls are muted in the immediate aftermath of such a tragedy , the fact that most of the victims were children appeared to drive the eagerness among those in Washington to shift to the policy debate as soon as possible .\nThe election behind him , Obama on Friday called for `` meaningful action . ''\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Monday that the issue will require a `` comprehensive solution '' involving gun control and other measures .\nWhat form that action could take remains to be seen . Democratic lawmakers have already gravitated toward a few specific proposals .\nOn the more sweeping end , Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D-Calif. , said Sunday she will introduce on the first day of the next session a de facto renewal of the assault-weapons ban that expired in 2004 . She said the bill would also ban high-capacity clips .\nOn Monday , Feinstein announced details of the bill , including that it would stop the sale of more than 100 assault weapons but protects gun owners by exempting more than 900 specific hunting and sporting weapons .\nThe bill more specifically stops the sale , transfer , importation and manufacturing of more than 100 specifically-named firearms and certain semiautomatic rifles , handguns and shotguns that can accept a detachable magazine . It also applies to semiautomatic rifles and handguns with a fixed magazine that can accept more than 10 rounds .\nIn addition , the bill stops the sale , transfer , importation and manufacturing of large-capacity ammunition feeding devices capable of accepting more than 10 rounds .\nLawmakers are also talking about closing the so-called `` gun show loophole , '' which allows people to buy weapons at gun shows without a background check .\nAnd some officials are discussing more incremental measures . Rep. Carolyn McCarthy , D-N.Y. , one of the most vocal gun control advocates on the Hill , endorsed the assault-weapons ban and the closure of the gun-show loophole , but also is suggesting a change to require a background check for private gun sales . And , in a letter to Obama on Sunday , she called for requiring federal agencies to share information gleaned from background checks .\nGun control opponents have kept their criticism mostly reserved in the wake of the Connecticut shooting , but they are sure to pipe up should legislation hit the floor next year .\nRep. Louie Gohmert , R-Texas , on `` Fox News Sunday , '' noted that stricter gun control does not necessarily mean crime rates will go down .\n`` Washington , D.C. , around us ought to be the safest place in America , and it 's not . Chicago ought to be safe . It 's not , because their gun laws do n't work , '' Gohmert said .\nGohmert said he wishes the principal at Sandy Hook Elementary School were armed so she could have taken `` his head off before he can kill those precious kids .
