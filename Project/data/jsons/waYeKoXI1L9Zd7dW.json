    "content": "Earlier this year the California-based network of Obria clinics wrestled a potential $ 5 million grant from the federal government . The group had positioned itself as the \u201c pro-life \u201d Planned Parenthood , an organization that could divert health grants into something that offered virginity instead of The Pill ; the kind of place destined to draw attention from federal agencies sympathetic to a rigid anti-abortion agenda .\nEight months later , it \u2019 s unclear exactly how those funds are being used , and reports portray the Obria health centers as deeply unprepared to provide the services initially promised . A Mother Jones investigation suggests Obria \u2019 s offices ( and mobile vans ) are barely seeing patients and inflating clinical partnerships ; the story also raises questions about how taxpayer money is actually being spent . Obria \u2019 s \u201c telehealth \u201d app , once shopped out to investors and donors , has yet to be fully developed . Abby Johnson , among the most sought-after motivational speakers in the anti-contraceptive movement after walking out of Planned Parenthood a decade ago , was at one point a high-profile Obria employee . Recently , she accused the organization of lying to the people who gave it money and orchestrating federal grants as a \u201c cash grab \u201d to pay executive salaries . ( That Johnson herself orchestrated something of a long-term cash grab when she fudged the circumstances of her exit from Planned Parenthood and built a small media empire on her story should not , however , go unrecognized . )\nTogether , these stories portray an organization almost comically unprepared to navigate the scrutiny of a federal grant program , a joke that would certainly be funnier if it hadn \u2019 t coincided with the draining of funding from clinics with decades of experience in both filing paperwork and providing care . The dissonance between Obria \u2019 s early marketing materials and the reality of its \u201c expansion \u201d probably have something to do with the anti-abortion network \u2019 s lack of experience in both of those matters , despite large infusions of taxpayer money to help them figure it out .\nAnd this is a funding stream , by the way , they seemed to have stumbled upon almost completely by accident : As emails obtained by the Campaign for Accountability suggest , the group only first learned of the Title X grant program from an article in Breitbart News , about a year before they were granted almost $ 2 million .\nObria , you may recall , is a \u201c holistic \u201d family planning network that purports to offer reproductive health care \u201c choice \u201d to anti-abortion patients . Founded by abstinence-only advocate Kathleen Eaton Bravo , it rebranded from a crisis pregnancy center to a more nuanced clinical setting in 2014 . Since the pivot , Bravo has courted donors and grant programs , explicitly softening the organization \u2019 s religious messaging and telling reporters she planned to recreate Planned Parenthood \u2019 s model of comprehensive care\u2014bolstered by state funding , just without the abortions or contraceptive options .\nBeginning in 2018 , ostensibly after coming across the 40-year-old program in a far-right website , Obria applied for Title X grants , hoping to harness funds from the only federal program specifically addressing the reproductive needs of low-income people . In March of 2019 , the organization was granted $ 1.7 million by an administration courting \u201c faith-based \u201d reproductive healthcare options , with the potential for over $ 5 million over the next three years\u2014inciting a debate over whether a clinic that does not offer condoms , birth control pills , or \u201c barrier \u201d methods of contraception qualifies for Title X funds , a question that remains murky today .\nAs Bravo expanded Obria , she promised rapid growth , telling donors she hoped to run 200 brick-and-mortar clinics by 2020 .
