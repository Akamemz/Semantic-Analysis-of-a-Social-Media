And Sen. John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) said Republicans \u2014 many of whom blessed the missive during a brisk signing session at a Senate lunch a week ago , as senators prepared to flee a Washington snowstorm \u2014 should have given it closer consideration .\n\u201c It was kind of a very rapid process . Everybody was looking forward to getting out of town because of the snowstorm , \u201d McCain said . \u201c I think we probably should have had more discussion about it , given the blowback that there is . \u201d\n\u201c I find it hard to believe that they understood the severity of what they were doing , \u201d said Sen. Debbie Stabenow ( D-Mich. ) .\nThough none of the 47 Republican signers has expressed regret for co-signing it , the missive , authored by freshman Sen. Tom Cotton , is creating unexpected fallout in Congress . And it threatens to linger politically and legislatively .\nSensing a public relations advantage , the campaign arm for Senate Democrats on Wednesday quickly circulated newspaper op-eds criticizing Republicans who signed the missive , and strategists said the issue will soon show up in TV ads in states of vulnerable senators . Democratic leader Harry Reid ( D-Nev. ) took to the Senate floor for a second time to blast Republican \u201c gimmicks \u201d on Iran and Secretary of State John Kerry called it a \u201c stunning \u201d breach of protocol after being teed up by a question from a Democratic senator at a committee hearing .\nOn the legislative front , a fragile bipartisan coalition of Iran hawks , who had been approaching a veto-proof majority for legislation that could potentially scuttle any U.S.-Iran nuclear agreement , was showing signs of cracking , as some centrist senators warned they were close to backing away from the measure .\nSen. Angus King of Maine , an independent who caucuses with the Democrats , said in an interview he currently backs the legislation designed to give the Senate more input on a nuclear deal , but he cautioned that the Iran letter is making him think twice .\n\u201c If I \u2019 m not convinced that this issue can be handled on the merits and not on a partisan basis , \u201d he said , \u201c then I \u2019 m going to change my mind . \u201d\nThe Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee wasted little time in using negative coverage of the letter as grist for the campaign trail . Throughout the day officials took aim at vulnerable incumbents by blasting out a series of newspaper editorials including one from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette , which wrote that Sen. Pat Toomey ( R-Pa. ) and his colleagues should be \u201c ashamed \u201d for signing the letter .\nIn an interview , Toomey said he \u201c didn \u2019 t have any particular anticipation of the level of controversy \u201d surrounding the letter . Asked whether Democratic attacks on his support for the missive will be effective , Toomey responded : \u201c Uh , no . \u201d\n\u201c They \u2019 ll use whatever they think works , \u201d he said . \u201c That letter is just the most recent case of my doing all that I can to prevent Iran from having a nuclear bomb . \u201d\nOhio \u2019 s Democratic former governor and current Senate candidate , Ted Strickland , lit into GOP incumbent Sen . Rob Portman for his \u201c reckless \u201d support of the letter . In an interview , Portman said he wasn \u2019 t even aware of the attack from Strickland or of Democrats \u2019 circulation of a Cleveland Plain Dealer editorial that bashed the \u201c usually rational \u201d senator .\nInstead , Portman said Democrats , especially those in the White House , are viewing the letter all wrong .\n\u201c We need a verifiable , strong agreement with Iran . And I think the letter helps us get there , \u201d Portman said . \u201c The Iranians are tough negotiators . [ The White House ] shouldn \u2019 t view it politically . They should use it to try to get a better agreement . \u201d\nBut there appeared to be little hope of turning back the clock on the politicization elicited by the letter , and multiple Democratic strategists predicted there would be more political repercussions to come for Republicans .
