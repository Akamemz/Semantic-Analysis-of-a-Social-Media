No , they \u2019 re just going to gather in a big circle and Pulitzer each other .\nImagine you committed a racial hate crime where you falsely accused people who didn \u2019 t look or think like you of a horrible atrocity , and that you \u2019 d have gladly picked some poor saps with the wrong skin tone out of a line-up and sent them to prison for decades given the chance . Now imagine the two half-wits you hired to help you managed to get caught on video buying their stereotype get-up and spilled it all to the fuzz , though the fact you paid them with a check \u2013 because you \u2019 re a criminal mastermind \u2013 was already enough to get a grand jury to indict your sorry AOC . Now , what are the chances the DA is going to transform your 16 felony counts into a $ 10K fine and a couple days community servicing ? Your chances of said outcome are poor . They are poor because your pals are neither Mrs. Obama or Willie Brown \u2019 s gal pal .\nNow imagine that you studied really hard while the rich kids partied and smoked dope and splattered water on you by running their BMWs through puddles as you walked home from high school .
