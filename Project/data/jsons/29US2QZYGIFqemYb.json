''\nNow this was a major narrative last year . While FEMA was credited with doing an excellent job after monster hurricanes in Texas and Florida , there was constant carping that Trump did n't show the proper degree of empathy , that he did n't wade into crowds and hug people . That , of course , is not his style\u2014he 's not a feel-your-pain guy like Bill Clinton or Barack Obama\u2014and does n't fit the traditional conception of how a politician should behave . ( And , of course , there was the media tantrum about Melania taking off in stilettos to flood-ravaged Houston . )\nBut then came Puerto Rico , which was absolutely devastated by a hurricane that so thoroughly destroyed the power grid that electricity was n't fully restored until recently . Trump was lambasted for tossing paper towels into a crowd there . And while it 's a fair criticism that the administration did n't focus as much attention on the Puerto Rican disaster , neither did the media\u2014until they turned it into a Trump-is-screwing-up .\nCNN 's Jeff Toobin even turned it into a racism argument : `` They 're not white people , and they do n't count to Donald Trump as much as the deaths of white people . '' So why did the deaths of Puerto Ricans\u2014who are of course Americans\u2014get a small fraction of the coverage as those in Florida and Texas ? And by the way , any administration would have struggled with the wreckage on the poverty-stricken territory .\nWhat triggered the latest round of criticism was a FEMA briefing on Florence at which Trump boasted about that situation . `` I think Puerto Rico was an incredible unsung success , '' said the president , who also tweeted that his administration did an `` unappreciated great job '' on the island .\nWell , it did n't take long for journalists to point out that nearly 3,000 people died from that storm , a tragic figure that was only recently officially confirmed after the ludicrous early estimate of less than 100 . And the president kind of stepped in it by not pointing that out .\nThat , in turn , revived a feud from last year , with San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz ripping Trump for `` despicable '' comments and `` lack of understanding of reality . ''\nThe president stepped in it more deeply this morning , tweeting : `` 3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico . When I left the Island , AFTER the storm had hit , they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths . As time went by it did not go up by much .
