    "content": "Now that the Republican campaign looks like it will last until a contested convention in Cleveland , Donald Trump and his supporters assert the whole system looks undemocratic .\nBut if democracy was organized to give everyone a fair and equal shot to impress the voters based on their knowledge and experience , then this system has been rigged for Donald Trump for the last nine months . The media -- not just the liberal media , but some `` conservative '' media , too -- have been the gale-force wind beneath Trump 's wings .\nOn the nightly network news on ABC , CBS , and NBC , Trump has far outpaced anyone else for attention . From last July through April 6 , he 's drawn 1,228 minutes of air time , or 56 percent of the coverage of the Republican primary race . The other 16 have split the remaining 44 percent . His closest rival , Ted Cruz , has only been granted 269 minutes of air time , or 12 percent . That 's roughly a 5-1 disparity . John Kasich has received only 46 minutes , or 2.1 percent of the Republican nightly-news pie . Even when Cruz or Kasich wins a state , the dominant story is Trump stumbling , not them winning . It 's Trump or virtually nothing . By design .\nThe media carnival for Trump was intense at the beginning , with the reality-TV star getting 71 percent of the coverage in both July and August last year . We 're late into the primaries and nothing 's changed . As the field shrunk to three in March , Trump surged again with 72 percent of the coverage . Trump was given 267 minutes of airtime to just 52 for Ted Cruz ( 14 percent ) and a mere 18 for John Kasich ( 4.8 percent ) .\nEven in the first week of April , as Cruz won Wisconsin , Trump drew 74.5 percent of the news minutes . Overall , Trump has received more than four times as much coverage as Cruz , and 26 times more than Kasich . Fairness and balance ? Forget about it . Anyone who watches is aware that the network coverage is often negative , but it still denies air time to opponents .\nDefenders of this overcoverage insist Trump is the most newsworthy one , and his actions make the most news . But the problem is not just quantity of the news , but the quality . Reporters let the Trump bluster and theatrics dominate , and ignore the substance of what 's going in behind it .\nTake the delegate selection in Colorado . The `` news '' everywhere was Trump complaining that Colorado was rigged : `` I 'm hundreds of delegates ahead but the system , folks , is rigged . It 's a rigged , disgusting , dirty system . '' What was not news , except as a rejoinder ( deep in the story ) by a Cruz partisan whose very presence cast suspicion on the veracity of the `` opinion , '' is that Trump is not being truthful .\nColorado established its delegate rules last August and Trump either ( a ) did n't have an organization in the state or ( b ) did n't care . The real story is Trump dishonestly crying foul about every state he loses . Every loss is due to stupid voters and/or a corrupt process . Show us how many networks have made that the news story .\nIn effect , the media just hand Trump the microphone and let him say whatever he wants about anything he wishes , and grant him credibility no matter how outrageous the pronouncement .
