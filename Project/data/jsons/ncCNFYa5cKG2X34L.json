The U.S. is willing to consider lifting sanctions against North Korea and has agreed to end \u201cwar games\u201d in the South Pacific. Additionally, North Korea will begin taking concrete steps to ending its nuclear program.\n\nIn the meantime, the U.S. will consult with South Korea and Japan, and then begin principals-level negotiations on the specifics.\n\nThis is all positive. If the standard for success at the Trump-Kim Summit in Singapore this week was solving a problem spanning three decades in a three-hour meeting, then no one could have been successful.\n\nLet us remember several key facts.\n\nPresident Obama told President-elect Trump that the single most difficult challenge he will face is North Korea.\n\nThe North Korean regime has continued to build its nuclear program, with failed deterrence from the past three American presidents.\n\nPresident Trump and his administration successfully negotiated several concessions ahead of the summit. North Korea ended ballistic missile tests and nuclear tests. North Korea reopened diplomatic discussions with South Korea with an eye toward formally ending the Korean War. North Korea released three American hostages.\n\nPresident Trump has been more successful dealing with North Korea in one year than the U.S. has been in the last 30 years.\n\nThe summit is only an important first step.\n\nBut we must remember that six months ago, nuclear war seemed plausible, as the threats and rhetoric escalated.
