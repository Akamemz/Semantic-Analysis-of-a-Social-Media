The crowd was young , diverse and notably not reaching to write checks , but it was plenty ready to hear his profane riff on his proposed gun buybacks .

But O \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s not doing the obvious anymore .\nIn the wake of August 3 , when a bigot with an AK-47-style assault rifle murdered 22 people in a Walmart in O \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s hometown of El Paso , Texas , the former congressman changed the way he \u2019 s waging his presidential campaign . He \u2019 s running with arguably reckless abandon , breaking norms to try to rekindle some lost spark . Beyond his much-discussed uptick in swearing , he has traveled to places that make limited political sense , taken a provocative proposal on assault rifles that could permanently jeopardize his electoral viability in his native state , and he has trashed President Donald Trump with increasingly explicit rhetoric . What \u2019 s interesting about O \u2019 Rourke at this moment is not just that he \u2019 s saying `` fuck '' a whole bunch\u2014he \u2019 s always dropped curse words on the stump\u2014but that he \u2019 s entered more broadly a new phase of his 2020 bid , which supporters find inspiring and critics consider desperate to the point of pathetic . Up close , though , it feels pretty compelling .\n\u201c That \u2019 s where I think he \u2019 s at now , \u201d Moses Mercado , a Democratic lobbyist from Texas , told me . `` He \u2019 s like , 'OK , well , screw it . ' ''\n\u201c He has no fucks to give , \u201d added Jay Surdukowski , an attorney and activist who is one of O \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s most devoted backers in New Hampshire .\n\u201c This feels right to me , \u201d O \u2019 Rourke told reporters by the fermentation tanks at Backlash after I asked him about how he \u2019 s campaigning . He said this is \u201c the way politics should be . \u201d\nThe question lurking behind this caution-free style is whether O \u2019 Rourke is doing this because he cares less about his stagnant candidacy or because he in fact cares so much more .\nSix months ago , O \u2019 Rourke was drawn into this race , it seemed , because of some combination of a sense of entitlement ( \u201c born to be in it \u201d ) along with an irresistible inertia ( he did , after all , bring in a record-breaking $ 80 million in his bid to unseat the unlovable Ted Cruz ) . After the lengthy will-he-or-won \u2019 t-he , the middle-of-America meandering and his overwrought postings on Medium , his entrance prompted a frenzy of live-coverage attention on cable news . Reality bit , alas , and right out of the gate was as good as it got . His fundraising dipped precipitously after his considerable initial intake . The mayor of the fourth-largest city in Indiana swiped his new-guy , next-gen fizz . He turned in oddly leaden showings in the first couple debates and languished in a polling position unbudgingly far behind the clear top three and trailing even out-of-nowhere entrepreneur Andrew Yang .\nO \u2019 Rourke hurried home . He stayed in El Paso for almost two weeks . He listened and gave hugs and attended vigils and silently marched . He called Trump a white supremacist . He called him \u201c the greatest threat to this country. \u201d He couldn \u2019 t fathom , he would say , leaving to go for the comparatively inconsequential \u201c corn dogs and Ferris wheels \u201d of the Iowa State Fair . Anxious , angry and rattled , he was asked by a reporter if there were anything Trump could do to \u201c make this any better. \u201d He answered with a kind of righteous despair that sounded new . But it boiled down to this : \u201c What the fuck ? \u201d\nBy the time he was ready to return to the trail , he did so by saying he could \u201c see more clearly , \u201d that there is \u201c a way to do this better \u201d and that one of those ways is to not simply retrace well-trodden , politically prudent early voting state paths .\nHe went to Mississippi to try to shine a spotlight on the recent raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement . He went to a gun show in Arkansas . He went to Oklahoma to go to the 1995 bombing memorial and the site of a 1921 race riot and talked about \u201c white nationalism \u201d and \u201c domestic terrorism. \u201d Even at pit stops in more expected locales , O \u2019 Rourke acted in ways that were suddenly , strikingly , even dangerously unstandard . At historically black Benedict College in South Carolina , for instance , his campaign booted a reporter from far-right Breitbart News .\nIt was in some ways reminiscent of his run against Cruz , in which he hit every one of the 254 counties in Texas , even the reddest of the red , all part of an effort that was not just DIY but ( to a fatal fault , some said ) DITWHW ( do it the way he wanted ) . And in a rural , Trump-loving portion of Virginia , after yet another mass shooting in West Texas , he said it was \u201c fucked up , \u201d and he said it live on CNN and made his stance on these kinds of guns even more blunt .\nHow , he was asked by a reporter , would he reassure owners of assault rifles that the government wasn \u2019 t coming to take their guns ?\n\u201c I want to be really clear , \u201d O \u2019 Rourke answered . \u201c That \u2019 s exactly what we \u2019 re going to do . \u201d\nJust in case that wasn \u2019 t enough , his campaign manager added in a tweet , \u201c GET EVERY ONE OF THOSE GODDAMN GUNS OFF OUR STREETS. \u201d Shortly thereafter , the campaign leaned in harder , hawking shirts that say , \u201c THIS IS F * CKED UP , \u201d not once , not twice , but six times stacked .\nWith this , O \u2019 Rourke \u201c broke some glass , \u201d as BuzzFeed \u2019 s Ben Smith wrote in his newsletter . In the minds , though , of some Texas political strategists , Republicans and Democrats alike , he did more than that . He might have killed his career , they told me .\n\u201c Those words will come back to destroy him should he run for statewide office again , \u201d said longtime Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf , who \u2019 s worked on campaigns all over the country .\n\u201c To say , \u2018 We will take away your guns , \u2019 you know , in this state , in this culture , that \u2019 s a no-no , \u201d Steinhauser said .\n\u201c His presidential bid , \u201d said Matt Mackowiak , a GOP strategist in Austin , \u201c has been very bad for his future in politics in Texas . \u201d\nLast week , though , he was in New York , for CNN \u2019 s climate change town hall , and from there he took the budget Bolt Bus to Boston . In the raw aftermath of the shooting in El Paso , the \u201c performance , the ritual \u2026 all the editing that goes into speaking when you \u2019 re running for office , \u201d he said during the ride , \u201c just really evaporated , or didn \u2019 t seem important , or I didn \u2019 t even really know that I cared at that point. \u201d He described the question that elicited his most memorable response \u201c the stupidest fucking question I \u2019 ve ever been asked. \u201d He described himself as \u201c pissed at the world . \u201d\nO \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s long been a slinger of four-letter salt when making his political pitch . But this new level has been hard to the point of impossible to ignore . And now at Backlash , which endeavors to \u201c brew in defiance , \u201d he harangued Trump and \u201c the crazy shit he says. \u201d He decried the suggestion that four black and brown women who are members of Congress should \u201c go back \u201d to anywhere that isn \u2019 t the United States of America . \u201c Tell me what the fuck that means ! \u201d he said . And he lamented the prevalence of weapons that were built for war and meant \u201c to shred your insides to shit . \u201d\n\u201c This is fucked up ! \u201d called out Chris Wright , 39 , a square-jawed , flat-topped food distributor from nearby Scituate wearing a blue \u201c Beto Por Texas \u201d T-shirt .\nO \u2019 Rourke heard him and looked at him : \u201c This is fucked up . \u201d\nSome see this as \u201c glorified performance art , \u201d \u201c a caricature of authenticity , \u201d but it \u2019 s working for Wright . \u201c Beto \u2019 s not afraid to say things , \u201d he said . \u201c He \u2019 s not afraid to say it like it is . For those people that say , \u2018 Oh , Trump says it like it is , \u2019 well , guess what , let \u2019 s go head to head . \u201d\nWill it work for not only Wright but many more persuadable voters ?
