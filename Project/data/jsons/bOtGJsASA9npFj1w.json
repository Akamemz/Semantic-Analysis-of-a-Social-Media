Hours earlier , the president had a rare televised meeting with lawmakers about how to protect this population .\n\u201c This is a time for vigilance , \u201d said Marielena Hincapi\u00e9 , executive director of the National Immigration Law Center , which has filed a separate lawsuit against the Trump administration for cancelling Daca in September 2017 .\nQuick guide What is Daca and who are the Dreamers ? Show Hide Who are the Dreamers ? Dreamers are young immigrants who would qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival ( Daca ) program , enacted under Barack Obama in 2012 . Most people in the program entered the US as children and have lived in the US for years \u201c undocumented \u201d . Daca gave them temporary protection from deportation and work permits . Daca was only available to people younger than 31 on 15 June 2012 , who arrived in the US before turning 16 and lived there continuously since June 2007 . Most Dreamers are from Mexico , El Salvador , Guatemala and Honduras , and the largest numbers live in California , Texas , Florida and New York . Donald Trump cancelled the program in September but has also said he wants Congress to develop a program to \u201c help \u201d the population . What will happen to the Dreamers ? Under the Trump administration , new applications under Daca will no longer be accepted . For those currently in the program , their legal status and other Daca-related permits ( such as to work and attend college ) will begin expiring in March 2018 \u2013 unless Congress passes legislation allowing a new channel for temporary or permanent legal immigration status \u2013 and Dreamers will all lose their status by March 2020 .\nTechnically , as their statuses lapse they could be deported and sent back to countries many have no familiarity with . It is still unclear whether this would happen . Fear had been rising in the run-up to last week \u2019 s announcement . Those with work permits expiring between 5 September 2017 and 5 March 2018 will be allowed to apply for renewal by 5 October . What does the recent ruling by Judge William Alsup mean ? In his ruling , Alsup ordered the Trump administration to restart the program , allowing Daca recipients who already qualify for the program to submit applications for renewal . However , he said the federal government did not have to process new applications from people who had not previously received protection under the program . When the Trump administration ended the Daca program , it allowed Daca recipients whose legal status expired on or before 5 March to renew their legal status . Roughly 22,000 recipients failed to successfully renew their legal status for various reasons . Legal experts and immigration advocates are advising Daca recipients not to file for renewal until the administration provides more information about how it intends to comply with the ruling . \u201c These next days and weeks are going to create a lot of confusion on the legal front , \u201d said Marielena Hincapie , executive director of the National Immigration Law Center , which has filed a separate lawsuit against the Trump administration \u2019 s termination of Daca .
