Instead , appeal to authority and accuse the democratic socialist of disloyalty to the corrupt Democratic Party .\nClinton 's campaign did just that this week , condemning Sanders for `` trying to convince the next generation of progressives that the Democratic Party is corrupt . ''\nThe notion that Sanders had to try to convince progressives of this in the first place is ludicrous . The warmongering , corporate-funded , pro-privatization Democratic Party leadership has long made it loud and clear that it is thoroughly corrupt and reactionary .\nYet Clinton and her supporters happen to be correct about one thing ; they are just right for the wrong reasons .\nBernie Sanders is not a Democrat . And this is a good thing .\nWhat the Clinton camp appears to be incapable of understanding is that the Democratic Party is less and less popular among progressive Americans .\nSince the rise of the Clintonian `` New Democrat '' almost three decades ago , the party has moved so far to the right it has little in common with the base it purports to represent .\nPresident Obama campaigned on the promise of change , but , in many ways , his presidency \u2014 particularly in the first term \u2014 was George W. Bush lite .\nThe Obama administration barely even slapped the banks and financial elites responsible for the Great Recession on the wrist . Not a single Wall Street executive went to jail while , today , the very banks responsible pose just as much of a systemic risk as they did in 2008 .\nThe Obama administration killed thousands of people , including an unknown number of civilians , with its secretive drone war . It expanded the war in Afghanistan \u2014 twice \u2014 dragged its feet on Guant\u00e1namo , backed a right-wing military coup that overthrew Honduras ' democratically elected left-wing government and dropped 23,400 bombs on six Muslim-majority countries in 2015 .\nThe Obama administration waged a McCarthyite crackdown on whistleblowers , using the World War I-era Espionage Act to clampdown on more than all previous presidential administrations combined , while drastically expanding the surveillance state .\nThis is the Democratic Party Americans have grown up with in the past nearly 30 years , since the rise of the Clintonism . And , in these same decades , wages have stagnated , poverty has increased and people have become more and more dissatisfied with the way things are .\nIt is true that Sanders ' social democratic politics are similar to those of New Deal Democrats . He often jokes that many of his policies were supported by President Dwight Eisenhower \u2014 a Republican in the 1950s .\nYet the Democratic Party of the mid-20th century is long gone .\nSince the fall of the Soviet Union , the U.S. has drifted more and more to the right \u2014 and taken much of the international community with it . During the Cold War , Western capitalist countries had to at least pretend to be concerned with fighting inequality and systemic discrimination . Today they no longer have to compete with an alternative .\nAs the Republican Party has shifted to the extreme , far-right , the Democratic Party moved along to the right with it . Instead of holding ground ( shifting to the left was not even on the table ) , the Democratic Party embraced neoliberalism .\nThe so-called `` Third Way '' paved by the Clintons is just another word for this process .\nHillary Clinton , a figure greatly admired by neoconservatives ( who are overwhelmingly backing her over Trump ) , represents a continuation of this status quo \u2014 a status quo millions upon millions of Americans have said they refuse to tolerate anymore .\nAmericans are desperate for actual change , and Sanders has offered a new path . Clinton has flatly insisted that Americans can not have basic things that much of the world takes for granted \u2014 single-payer health care , free public higher education , environmental policies that do n't rely on fossil fuel corporations that destroy the planet . Sanders says otherwise .\nThe Democratic Party is a party of corporate influence and military power . It is chock-full of 1 percenters , with leaders like Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel \u2014 who shuts down public schools en masse and covers up police killings of unarmed black residents \u2014 or Debbie Wasserman Schultz \u2014 who is working to help loan sharks .\nMany of the things that have been called for by Donald Trump , a fascistic demagogue , have already been implemented by the Democratic Party .\nThe Obama administration has deported more than 2.5 million people \u2014 more than any other president . It is sending Central American refugees fleeing violence back to where they are killed .\nThe Obama administration is more and more heavily militarizing the border , a process that began with the Clinton administration 's passing of NAFTA .\nThe Obama administration is discriminating against Muslims throughout society , with widespread police surveillance and entrapment , along with shadowy policies like the no-fly list .\nWhen Clinton 's campaign and her supporters implore Americans to oppose Sanders because he is not a Democrat , it is nothing more than a disingenuous appeal to authority .\nWhat they are really saying is loyalty to the Democratic Party is more important than loyalty to the left-wing ideals that it supposedly espouses .\nThis is the textbook definition of rank opportunism . For them , being a loyal Democrat is more important than having left-wing politics .\nUnder eight years of a Democratic presidential administration , life for the average working-class American , and particularly for the average working-class American of color , has not gotten better ; it has gotten worse .\nThe Clintons , the most powerful force in the Democratic Party , happen to embody everything that is wrong with it .
