For example , according to Snowden documents , the U.S. has conducted spy operations in Second Life ( pictured ) , where players create human avatars to socialize , buy and sell goods and explore exotic virtual destinations .

In Second Life , players create customized human avatars that can resemble themselves or take on other personas \u2014 supermodels and bodybuilders are popular \u2014 who can socialize , buy and sell virtual goods , and go places like beaches , cities , art galleries and strip clubs . In Microsoft \u2019 s Xbox Live service , subscribers connect online in games that can involve activities like playing soccer or shooting at each other in space .\nAccording to American officials and documents that Mr. Snowden provided to The Guardian , which shared them with The New York Times and \u2588\u2588\u2588 , spy agencies grew worried that terrorist groups might take to the virtual worlds to establish safe communications channels .\nIn 2007 , as the NSA and other intelligence agencies were beginning to explore virtual games , NSA officials met with the chief technology officer for the manufacturer of Second Life , the San Francisco-based Linden Lab . The executive , Cory Ondrejka , was a former Navy officer who had worked at the NSA with a top-secret security clearance .\nHe visited the agency \u2019 s headquarters at Fort Meade , Md. , in May 2007 to speak to staff members over a brown bag lunch , according to an internal agency announcement . \u201c Second Life has proven that virtual worlds of social networking are a reality : come hear Cory tell you why ! \u201d said the announcement . It added that virtual worlds gave the government the opportunity \u201c to understand the motivation , context and consequent behaviors of non-Americans through observation , without leaving U.S. soil . \u201d\nOndrejka , now the director of mobile engineering at Facebook , said through a representative that the NSA presentation was similar to others he gave in that period , and declined to comment further .\nEven with spies already monitoring games , the NSA thought it needed to step up the effort .\n\u201c The Sigint Enterprise needs to begin taking action now to plan for collection , processing , presentation and analysis of these communications , \u201d said one April 2008 NSA document , referring to \u201c signals intelligence. \u201d The document added , \u201c With a few exceptions , NSA can \u2019 t even recognize the traffic , \u201d meaning that the agency could not distinguish gaming data from other Internet traffic .\nBy the end of 2008 , according to one document , the British spy agency , known as GCHQ , had set up its \u201c first operational deployment into Second Life \u201d and had helped the police in London in cracking down on a crime ring that had moved into virtual worlds to sell stolen credit card information . The British spies running the effort , which was code-named \u201c Operation Galician , \u201d were aided by an informer using a digital avatar \u201c who helpfully volunteered information on the target group \u2019 s latest activities . \u201d\nThough the games might appear to be unregulated digital bazaars , the companies running them reserve the right to police the communications of players and store the chat dialogues in servers that can be searched later . The transactions conducted with the virtual money common in the games , used in World of Warcraft to buy weapons and potions to slay monsters , are also monitored by the companies to prevent illicit financial dealings .\nIn the 2008 NSA document , titled \u201c Exploiting Terrorist Use of Games & Virtual Environments , \u201d the agency said that \u201c terrorist target selectors \u201d \u2014 which could be a computer \u2019 s Internet Protocol address or an email account \u2014 \u201c have been found associated with Xbox Live , Second Life , World of Warcraft \u201d and other games . But that document does not present evidence that terrorists were participating in the games .\nStill , the intelligence agencies found other benefits in infiltrating these online worlds . According to the minutes of a January 2009 meeting , GCHQ \u2019 s \u201c network gaming exploitation team \u201d had identified engineers , embassy drivers , scientists and other foreign intelligence operatives to be World of Warcraft players \u2014 potential targets for recruitment as agents .\nAt Menwith Hill , a Royal Air Force base in the Yorkshire countryside that the NSA has long used as an outpost to intercept global communications , American and British intelligence operatives started an effort in 2008 to begin collecting data from World of Warcraft .\nOne NSA document said that the World of Warcraft monitoring \u201c continues to uncover potential Sigint value by identifying accounts , characters and guilds related to Islamic extremist groups , nuclear proliferation and arms dealing. \u201d In other words , targets of interest appeared to be playing the fantasy game , though the document does not indicate that they were doing so for any nefarious purposes . A British document from later that year said that GCHQ had \u201c successfully been able to get the discussions between different game players on Xbox Live . \u201d\nBy 2009 , the collection was extensive . One document says that while GCHQ was testing its ability to spy on Second Life in real time , British intelligence officers vacuumed up three days \u2019 worth of Second Life chat , instant message and financial transaction data , totaling 176,677 lines of data , which included the content of the communications .\nFor their part , players have openly worried that the NSA might be watching them .\nIn one World of Warcraft discussion thread , begun just days after the first Snowden revelations appeared in the news media in June , a human death knight with the user name \u201c Crrassus \u201d asked whether the NSA might be reading game chat logs .\n\u201c If they ever read these forums , \u201d wrote a goblin priest with the user name \u201c Diaya , \u201d \u201c they would realize they were wasting \u201d their time .\nEven before the American government began spying in virtual worlds , the Pentagon had identified the potential intelligence value of video games . The Pentagon \u2019 s Special Operations Command in 2006 and 2007 worked with several foreign companies \u2014 including an obscure digital media business based in Prague \u2014 to build games that could be downloaded to mobile phones , according to people involved in the effort .

( The Meridian Group , SAIC )\nEager to cash in on the government \u2019 s growing interest in virtual worlds , several large private contractors have spent years pitching their services to American intelligence agencies . In one 66-page document from 2007 , part of the cache released by Mr. Snowden , the contracting giant SAIC promoted its ability to support \u201c intelligence collection in the game space , \u201d and warned that online games could be used by militant groups to recruit followers and could provide \u201c terrorist organizations with a powerful platform to reach core target audiences . \u201d\nIt is unclear whether SAIC received a contract based on this proposal , but one former SAIC employee said that the company at one point had a lucrative contract with the CIA for work that included monitoring the Internet for militant activity .
