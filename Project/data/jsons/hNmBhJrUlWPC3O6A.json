    "content": "In the days since an Alexandria , Virginia , jury convicted Paul Manafort on eight counts of bank and tax fraud , President Donald Trump has abandoned all semblance of subtlety with regard to the possibility that he might pardon his former campaign chairman . \u201c I feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family , \u201d he wrote on Twitter the following morning , calling Manafort \u201c brave \u201d for refusing to \u201c break \u201d under pressure . On Thursday , the president \u2019 s personal lawyer , Rudy Giuliani , confirmed speculation that clemency could be in the offing , telling The Washington Post that Manafort was indeed among several individuals Trump had discussed pardoning . \u201c He feels Manafort has been mistreated . Nobody in a case like this gets raided in the middle of the night , put in solitary confinement , \u201d Giuliani said . \u201c They tried to crack him and it didn \u2019 t work . Over the last two to three weeks , he \u2019 s expressed anger and frustration about how he \u2019 s been treated . \u201d\nTrump was ultimately convinced that any pardon for Manafort should wait until after Robert Mueller wraps up his Russia probe , according to the Post . ( The White House press secretary said the president \u201c has not made a decision on pardoning Paul Manafort or anyone else. \u201d ) But even without officially issuing a pardon to Manafort , Trump might have waded into choppy legal waters simply by dangling the prospect of absolution . Trump , after all , is being investigated by the special counsel for potential obstruction of justice\u2014an allegation that is unlikely to lead to an indictment , as I have previously reported , but one that could serve as the basis for articles of impeachment . If Manafort were to believe he has a fighting chance of having his slate wiped clean , that could eliminate his incentive to cut a deal . Trump , in effect , would be tampering with a potential witness .\n\u201c This is yet one more instance , this time out of the mouth of his own lawyer , that the president is signaling to Manafort that a pardon may be on the way . It is impossible not to see this as encouragement to a witness in a criminal investigation to withhold cooperation , \u201d Bob Bauer , who served as White House general counsel to Barack Obama , told me . \u201c It is remarkable that Giuliani and his team do not see how the president , with this conduct , continues to do extraordinary damage to his position in the ongoing investigations . \u201d\nWhether Trump \u2019 s conduct is illegal depends on his intent , according to Harry Litman , a former United States attorney and deputy assistant attorney general . \u201c I think it \u2019 s really straightforward legally\u2014but that doesn \u2019 t mean straightforward factually , \u201d Litman told me . \u201c If Trump is either dangling a pardon or giving a pardon in order to prevent Manafort from giving truthful testimony to Mueller , that \u2019 s obstruction of justice .
