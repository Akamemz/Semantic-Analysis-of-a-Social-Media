Nine governors , eight of whom were Republicans from the South or Midwest , got A marks . Fifteen , including Gov . Larry Hogan ( R ) of Maryland and Jim Justice of West Virginia ( R ) , got D \u2019 s , and five Democrats got F \u2019 s . In the update , one governor was downgraded to an F- .\nThe report considers \u201c the severity of the virus in each state and the need to keep their citizens safe \u201d and relates it to \u201c how measured or damaging their actions have been with respect to safeguarding the economic well-being of their citizens. \u201d It \u2019 s premised on the belief that except for \u201c a few exceptions in some metropolitan areas , the time is long past for every state to reopen safely , smartly , and judiciously so as to end the economic destruction and despair from lockdowns . \u201d\nAs for the grading , the report explains that A \u2019 s and B \u2019 s are for governors who \u201c are already moving to restore freedom and opportunity , and trusting individuals to follow best practices or isolate themselves based on their own risk assessments. \u201d The governors who got D \u2019 s and F \u2019 s have taken the other tack ; they \u201c arbitrarily ban activities without respect to any sensible risk versus benefit calculation \u201d and put their states at \u201c risk of catastrophic economic collapse . \u201d\nThe day after the report was first released , there were reports that some governors acted .

Gavin Newsom ( D ) , who got a D , said that retail stores could reopen for curbside pickup and allowed nonessential manufacturing to start . Virginia Gov .

Doug Ducey ( R ) , who started with a C , also accelerated the reopening of restaurants and salons .\nOther governors have responded with less grace . Pennsylvania Gov . Tom Wolf ( D ) , who was unsurprisingly given an F in the report card , criticized business owners moving to reopen notwithstanding his edicts , accusing them of \u201c cowardly acts. \u201d He also threatened those businesses that reopen with the loss of health department certifications , liquor licenses , and certificates of occupancy . Finally , Gov . Wolf declared that counties that refused to comply with his orders would not be eligible to receive discretionary federal stimulus funds .\nIn the same way , Michigan Gov . Gretchen Whitmer , who received a D , started by declaring home improvement and landscaping purchases off limits while allowing Michigan residents to buy lottery tickets .

Tony Evers ( D ) also got an F.
