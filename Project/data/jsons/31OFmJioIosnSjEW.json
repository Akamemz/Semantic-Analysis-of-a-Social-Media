Trump 's organizational weakness in that type of contest was underscored Saturday when he was swept by Ted Cruz in the Colorado Republican convention .\nSanders , meanwhile , has to win not only more pledged delegates but also more superdelegates -- party officials and other elites who can vote however they choose -- if he wants to take the Democratic battle for the White House to the convention floor .\nTrump is already making the case that the system is inherently unfair and is a symptom of the insider politics practiced by distant elites that disenfranchises grass-roots voters like those who have flocked to his campaign .\n`` You see what 's happening to me and Bernie Sanders , '' Trump said Sunday in Rochester , New York . `` It 's a corrupt deal going on . ''\nThe 2016 campaign 's shift from a simple hunt for primary wins is more than a sign that the electoral calendar is running out and routes to the nomination for both parties are beginning to narrow . It 's proof that for all of its busted conventional wisdom and broken political rules , the wild presidential campaign is at a point where insurgent politics are no longer sufficient to win .\n`` The nuts and bolts of presidential politics is an archaic language and very few people understand it .

Cruz also secured all of the final 13 delegates who were selected in Colorado this weekend .\nThe strategy is designed to prepare the way for multiple rounds of convention balloting when delegates awarded to Trump could be freed up to migrate to another candidate .
