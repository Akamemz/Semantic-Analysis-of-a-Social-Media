Carlson 's not a political leader , but he 's a bellwether , and his words are already being cheered by prominent conservatives . Meant as a rebuttal to Mitt Romney 's New Year 's Day op-ed , the speech was n't original , but it reveals the degree to which Republicans have embraced the populist authoritarianism they once condemned .\nCarlson began with several swipes against `` bankers '' who exploit the working class to line the pockets of spooky elites . If that anti-capitalist lingo sounds familiar , so does his contemptuous shrug at the ways free markets improve lives . `` Does anyone still believe that cheaper iPhones or more Amazon deliveries of plastic garbage from China are going to make us happy ? They have n't so far . '' This is a time-worn rhetorical technique of freedom 's enemies , who sneer at material standards of living in order to elevate abstract social goals over the needs of actual people . In fact , cheaper consumer goods have benefited Americans immeasurably . Some 85 million now own iPhones , for instance , and use them not as trinkets , but as work tools or devices to keep in touch with loved ones . And while Amazon may deliver `` plastic garbage , '' it also delivers syringes to diabetics , toys for special-needs kids , and even prosthetic limbs for the disabled\u2014all , of course , made of plastic . Freer markets and abundant , affordable imports , have made the average American wealthier than Rockefeller , and 90 times richer than the average human being .\nDoes that translate into happiness ? It depends . More wealth means better access to innovative medical technology , cheaper and safer transportation , cultural riches of art and music .
