The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\n(CNN) -- As the country searches its soul in the wake of the recent wave of questionable killings by police, Americans of all races are struggling with a distressing sense of deja vu. This is not the first time we have struggled with this anguish and it will not be the last. But there may be a new prospect for hope this time.\n\nPerhaps more than at any point in the country's history, Americans are open to changing the way they look at police violence.

But a typical case with substantial defense evidence (for example, bystanders who support the defendant's account and corroborating physical evidence) never gets to a grand jury in the first place.\n\nThe grand jurors in Ferguson and Staten Island were doing something different from what typical grand jurors do.
