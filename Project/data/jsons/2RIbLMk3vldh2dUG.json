    "content": "In a Park Hyatt hotel ballroom in midtown Manhattan , on Wednesday , Greta Thunberg , the sixteen-year-old climate activist , stood before world leaders and delivered a goosebump-inducing speech . The occasion was the release of \u201c The Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate , \u201d a major scientific report by the U.N. \u2019 s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , which concluded that human activities have made the oceans increasingly inhospitable to marine life and have caused glacial melt and sea-level rise to happen at an even faster rate than scientists had previously projected . The effects\u2014already well under way , with some locked in over the next century\u2014pose an immediate threat to the survival of certain island nations and high-alpine communities , as well as hundreds of millions of other coastal inhabitants and many of the world \u2019 s fisheries . \u201c The reason we have taken to the streets is because of science , \u201d Thunberg said , after thanking the U.N. scientists who authored the report . \u201c This is about an existential crisis for the biosphere and for humanity. \u201d On the projection screen behind her was a seal stranded on a tiny iceberg in a big blue ocean . \u201c Our main enemy now is physics . We can still fix this , it is still possible , but not if we continue like now. \u201d She concluded , \u201c We must listen to the scientists . \u201d\nThe report , which is based on nearly seven thousand peer-reviewed studies , was prepared and written by a hundred and four scientists from thirty-six countries . It was the latest addition in a dire trilogy of I.P.C.C . special reports , which previously included studies on the extreme risks of even 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming and on the impacts of climate change on land . ( Additionally , the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services , a U.N.-backed body , released a report in May on the accelerating rate of widespread extinction across species . ) Wednesday \u2019 s report took a similarly comprehensive approach to studying climate change \u2019 s impact on ice formations , sea level , and the planet \u2019 s oceans .\n\u201c The ocean today is higher , warmer , more acidic , less productive , and it holds less oxygen , \u201d Jane Lubchenco , a former administrator of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , said . As a result , coral reefs are bleaching a ghostly white , and , although some can recover , others are dying at a rapid rate . Monster storms are persistent . Marine heat waves\u2014projected to increase fiftyfold if current trends continue\u2014are depleting fisheries . Ocean acidification is severely harming all sorts of species , which then harms people , too , since many of these species are critical to local economies . Glaciers are melting faster with consequences for people in the mountains and on the coasts alike . On Tuesday , just two hundred and sixty miles from Monaco , where I.P.C.C . scientists and government representatives were negotiating the report \u2019 s final language , Italian authorities in the town of Courmayeur closed roads and evacuated homes after warning that the Mont Blanc glacier was on the brink of collapse . \u201c This phenomenon once again testifies that the mountain is in a phase of strong change due to climatic factors , therefore it is particularly vulnerable , \u201d the town \u2019 s mayor said .\nOne major new development in the report is the elevation of the coastal-flood risk . By 2050 , in many places globally , the current hundred-year flood will occur every year , even if we cut emissions to the lowest levels considered achievable , putting megacities ( with populations greater than ten million ) , including Jakarta , Manila , Bangkok , Surabaya , and parts of Los Angeles , at serious risk . For some areas , the hundred-year-flood level is not much higher than the current water level , meaning it may be a more manageable problem . For other areas , the hundred-year level is a couple of feet above high tide . These places will require either very expensive adaptation measures or abandonment . \u201c If the hundred-year event turns into an annual event , that means the three-hundred-year , five-hundred-year , and currently less frequent events also occur more often , \u201d Michael Oppenheimer , one of the report \u2019 s authors and a professor of geosciences and international affairs at Princeton University , said . \u201c On small islands , a couple feet is the difference between existing and non-existing . \u201d\nAccording to the report , by 2100 , even in the best-case emissions scenario\u2014meaning we surpass the targets of the Paris Agreement\u2014the global mean sea level will still rise by about one and a half feet , relative to its average levels at the turn of this century . If we continue emitting greenhouse gases at current rates , however , it could rise much more rapidly , reaching nearly three feet of sea-level rise by 2100 ( and an unimaginable eighteen feet over the next few centuries ) . These , of course , are global averages ; along certain coasts , owing to sinking lands from human development , as well as other geologic causes , sea-level rise will be higher . \u201c The ocean is already rising , rising faster than we had predicted , it will continue to rise , and that only serves to underscore the emergency we are confronted with now , the urgency of reducing carbon emissions as rapidly as possible , \u201d Lubchenco , the former NOAA administrator , said .\nThe rise will come primarily from the melting of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets . Theories about the potential for warming to destabilize Antarctica \u2019 s ice were first posed in the late seventies by an eccentric glaciologist from Ohio State University named John Mercer . In 1978 , he published a paper in Nature called the \u201c West Antarctic Ice Sheet and CO 2 Greenhouse Effect : A Threat of Disaster. \u201d He predicted that the warming atmosphere could melt the ice sheet from underneath , causing sections to rapidly break away and raise sea levels . He was labelled an alarmist , and had difficulty finding research funding in the years that followed . Even in 1990 , many scientists still believed that the ice sheet in Antarctica would be stable for thousands of years , even with large amounts of warming . Today scientists are clear that Mercer was right .\nThe deliberations in Monaco took place while more than four million people took to the streets globally , led by Thunberg and young students , in the largest climate protest in history , on Friday , and then heads of state met at the United Nations , for the so-called Climate Action Summit , convened by Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres , on Monday . The summit resulted in little promise of action . President Trump made a brief visit , and listened to remarks by Prime Minister Narendra Modi , of India , and Chancellor Angela Merkel , of Germany\u2014but skipped the rest , including an electrifying speech by Thunberg in which she , yet again , called out the unforgivable behavior of the world \u2019 s leaders in failing to make the changes that scientists say we need . A summit attendee posted a video , which immediately went viral , showing Trump \u2019 s arrival , with Mike Pence in tow and Thunberg behind both of them , glaring at their backs .\nLisa Speer , the director of the Natural Resources Defense Council \u2019 s International Oceans Program , was in Monaco . \u201c Sitting through this meeting was alternately incredibly tedious , riveting , and profoundly depressing , \u201d she told me . \u201c When they were talking about these really harrowing effects , I couldn \u2019 t help but think , We \u2019 re all going to be in the cryosphere. \u201d She laughed . \u201c You need a little humor to get through it. \u201d She noted the linkages that this report establishes\u2014how ice melt sends increasing amounts of freshwater into the ocean , causing a phenomenon of layering , or stratification , in which the freshwater acts as a kind of lid , preventing the ocean from maintaining the oxygen levels that marine life needs to survive . Or how the warming ocean causes more intense storms , and how the rising ocean causes the impact from storm surge to have that much more power to do damage .\nDespite the grim picture , there is still time to stop emissions and prevent the kind of annihilating sea-level rise and species extinction from which there is no recovery . Another major report , released this week by the High-Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy ( consisting of heads of government from fourteen countries ) , and written by a group of experts and scientists , laid out the ocean \u2019 s vast potential for mitigating climate change . The solutions it put forth could provide up to a fifth of the emissions cuts needed by 2050 in order to keep global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius . They offered five areas : offshore renewable energy ( primarily wind , as well as floating solar , wave , and tidal power ) ; ocean-based transport-efficiency measures ( better hull design , and the decarbonization of coastal ferry fleets and ports ) ; marine conservation and restoration of ocean-based carbon sinks ( mangroves , seagrass beds , and salt marshes ) ; improved reliance on fisheries ( through better management of wild stocks , the expansion of sustainable aquaculture , and dietary shifts to low-carbon marine foods , including seaweed , kelp , and shellfish ) ; and , most controversially , the unproved potential of carbon storage in the seabed . But , as Wednesday \u2019 s I.P.C.C . report makes clear , the window for implementing any of these solutions is closing fast . \u201c The risk is growing faster than our current ability to handle the situation , \u201d Michael Oppenheimer told me . \u201c It may become unmanageable over coming decades , so time is of the essence . \u201d",
