( Likeliest if Trump wins ) or Democrats take control of the Senate , but the House remains in GOP control with a narrower margin . ( Likeliest if Clinton wins )\nIn the House , Republicans would continue to struggle to find a 218-member governing majority for even the most basic legislative responsibilities . But leaning on Democratic votes to pass bills sparks backlash and anger from the party 's right flank .\nIt 's the dynamic that troubled former House Speaker John Boehner and ultimately played a role in his decision to resign . Speaker Paul Ryan has received high marks for his transition into the leadership , but the underlying challenge remains the same . 2017 will be a more interesting test of Ryan 's leadership and governing abilities , particularly if Hillary Clinton wins and he considers a 2020 presidential bid .\nIn the Senate , the 60-vote threshold for essentially all major legislation is also a significant barrier to the majority party and gives the minority blocking power .\nThere will likely be more debate over whether there needs to be filibuster reform to break the logjam .
