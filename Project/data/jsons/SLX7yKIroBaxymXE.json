Sure , it helped get him elected , but is it really helping him govern ? His off-the-cuff style can be fun , and I can \u2019 t help but enjoy the way he drives lefties out of the tattered remnants of their minds , but spewing out every little thing that annoys him about whatever he \u2019 s watching on cable news\u2026 It just seems like a bad idea in the long run .\nThat said , he has every right to do it , and he \u2019 s under no obligation to listen to anybody he doesn \u2019 t want to . Twitter allows users to mute or block any other user , at any time and for any reason . You can say whatever you want , but that doesn \u2019 t oblige anybody else to listen .\nThat \u2019 s not enough for some people , though , because Hillary lost and it isn \u2019 t fair and they will not be ignored . Charlie Savage , NYT :\nLawyers for Twitter users blocked by President Trump after they criticized or mocked him are asking him to reverse the moves , arguing that the Constitution bars him from blocking people on the social media service .\nThe request raises novel legal issues stemming from Mr. Trump \u2019 s use of his Twitter account , @ realDonaldTrump , to make statements about public policy\u2026\nThe blocked Twitter users are represented by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University , whose executive director , Jameel Jaffer , said in a statement that Mr. Trump did not have a right to exclude his critics from engaging with his posts\u2026\nOne of the Twitter users the letter said Mr. Trump had blocked is Holly O \u2019 Reilly , whose account is @ AynRandPaulRyan .\nAfter reading this , I became curious about the sort of person who would threaten to sue the President of the United States for blocking her on Twitter .

I \u2019 d never even heard of her before yesterday . And yet the woman who made the pages of the New York Times because Trump blocked her\u2026 had blocked me .
