    "content": "Rep. Stephen Fincher , R-Tenn. , is refusing to respond to critics who accuse him of receiving millions of dollars in farm subsidies while supporting billions of dollars in cuts to food stamps .\nFincher is one of the largest recipients of federal farm subsidies , according to the Environmental Working Group , a research and advocacy organization that also investigates government subsidies . By EWG \u2019 s count , the Republican congressman received nearly $ 3.5 million in federal subsidies between 1999 and 2012 . In one year alone , he was given nearly $ 560,000 in commodity subsidies -- government cash payments used by farmers to supplement their income . Those types of subsidies affect the cost and supply of crops .\nHe was among dozens of lawmakers on the House Committee on Agriculture who last week voted 36 to 10 to pass the 2013 farm bill . The bill proposes $ 40 billion in savings and a $ 9 billion increase to the crop insurance program . Half of the savings would result from a $ 20 billion reduction in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , commonly known as food stamps .\n\u201c To me it is just hypocrisy with a capital \u2018 H , \u2019 \u201d said Donald Carr , senior adviser at EWG .
