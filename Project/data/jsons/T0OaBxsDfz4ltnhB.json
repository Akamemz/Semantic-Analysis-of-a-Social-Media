WikiLeaks has denied any substantive contacts with Stone.\n\nOBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE INQUIRY\n\nOf all the avenues of inquiry, perhaps the least is known about Mueller\u2019s investigation into whether Trump obstructed justice by trying to impede the Russia inquiry. There have been no indictments or court action related to this issue.\n\nA pivotal incident was Trump\u2019s May 2017 firing of FBI Director James Comey, an act some legal experts have said could be charged as obstruction of justice especially because Trump days later told NBC News he was thinking about \u201cthis Russia thing\u201d when he made the decision.

Justice Department documents show that Mueller\u2019s office reported spending around $9 million during the 2018 fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30. No figures are available for fiscal 2019.",
