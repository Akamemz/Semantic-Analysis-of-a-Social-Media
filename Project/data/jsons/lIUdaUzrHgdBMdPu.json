    "content": "Is Slack good for actually getting your work done ? That \u2019 s debatable . But the popular messaging platform \u2014 which now boasts more than 12 million daily active users \u2014 is definitely a promising medium for employers , regulatory agencies , the government , and even hackers seeking a trove of data about a company and its workers . Even your coworkers could find out more about you than you might expect .\nYes , your employer can get to your private messages . They \u2019 re not the only one .\nFirst off , employers aren \u2019 t necessarily going through your messages to snoop on gossip .\n\u201c The company may have a duty to preserve and produce that information if you \u2019 re part of a lawsuit , \u201d explains Brad Harris , the vice president of product at Hanzo , a company that provides a third-party , data-preservation app that works in conjunction with Slack . \u201c The company may also want to do internal investigations , and through their privacy policies and acceptable use policies , have the right to look at your information . \u201d\nHarris added , \u201c Companies have traditionally had that [ right ] with email . \u201d\nWhether and how your boss can export your private messages and private channels depends on a few factors . If your employer is using Slack \u2019 s free or standard plan \u2014 you can check this by going through the drop-down menu under your name on the app \u2014 they need Slack \u2019 s go-ahead , meaning the company will review your employer \u2019 s request and , if approved , allow the employer to conduct a one-time export . The messaging platform says it will provide that content if a company has gained employees \u2019 consent , if the company is following a \u201c valid legal process , \u201d or if there \u2019 s a \u201c right or requirement [ to do so ] under applicable laws . \u201d\nFor instance , employees in the European Union have the right to certain data collected about them by their employers under the General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) . Companies using a Plus plan also need to apply for approval from Slack to export private communications , but the company can continue using the feature until they decide to turn it off .\nKeep in mind that the data downloaded by an employer isn \u2019 t a mirror image of the actual Slack platform . Instead , workplace data is delivered in ZIP files , which contain a type of data-storing file called JSON . That means content comes up in long lines that resemble code , and includes message text , information about reactions , and even edit history ( that \u2019 s right , your company could retain your deleted messages ) . You can see what that data actually looks like on Slack \u2019 s website , and if you want a quick profile of what data your company might be keeping , go to [ yourorganization ] .slack.com/account/workspace-settings # retention .\nIt \u2019 s also possible that your employer has invested in a higher-level plan , like Enterprise Grid . Those plans work with third-party apps like Hanzo that allow employers to store messages and other information . Companies may need to consistently preserve electronic communications for review by regulatory agencies , such as the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and the Financial Industry Regulation Authority .\nStill , Slack expects employers to follow employment agreements , corporate policies , and any relevant laws . \u201c For employees , an employer \u2019 s rights to access your data are controlled by your employment agreement and by the laws that govern that \u2014 not by Slack , \u201d said a Slack spokesperson in an email . \u201c Employers ultimately own their company \u2019 s Slack data and are responsible for complying with the laws that govern how they access that data . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s worth keeping in mind that there \u2019 s always the manual approach to surveilling employees \u2019 electronic communications : booting them from their computers while their Slack accounts are still logged in . One boss described this technique in a Y Combinator thread about the investigation of an intern harassment problem .\nLaw enforcement and legal processes can get your Slacks , too\nOne route to your private Slack messages being revealed ? A lawsuit . Let \u2019 s say you \u2019 re suing your former employer for sexual harassment . If you think there \u2019 s evidence that could help prove your case on Slack \u2014 inappropriate messages from your boss , for example \u2014 you can fight for those records to be legally \u201c discoverable , \u201d meaning your old company will have to produce them . Discussion of Slack data can come up in all sorts of complaints , as it did as part of one class action lawsuit against the game developer Activision Blizzard . Discussion of Slack data also came up in a lawsuit against the California-based lighting fixture company Lamps Plus .\nThe government might also want Slack data as part of other legal processes .\nIn its most recent transparency report ( which was published this week and covers all of 2019 ) , Slack says it received 66 requests from US government entities for both content and metadata , including through search warrants , subpoenas , and civil subpoenas . Only nine of the requests for content data were fulfilled by Slack , but in 24 cases , the company provided government entities with other , non-content data , such as information about the date , time , and identities of senders and recipients of messages and files . Keep in mind , those numbers are pretty small ; the company said in its last earnings report that it had more than 105,000 organizations paying for its service , and customers can also use the platform for free .\nSlack also says it will consider \u201c national security requests , \u201d though the company says it has yet to receive any . Slack has , however , granted one request for non-content , user data stored in the US from an unnamed foreign government as part of following a mutual legal assistance treaty .\nMeanwhile , if you actually work for the government , it \u2019 s possible that your Slack communications are records subject to Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) requests . FOIA is a law that allows nosey members of the public and journalists to request records about government activities , and the government must respond to those requests within 20 business days . FOIA requesters appear to have successfully asked for other Slack-related data , such as a list of team domains used by the government \u2019 s General Services Administration . We couldn \u2019 t immediately find an example of when a US FOIA request has led to the release of Slack messages from within a government agency ( though some have tried ) , if only because it \u2019 s unclear how many local , state , and federal government workers are using Slack .\nBut a search of a federal contracts database reveals that the Department of State , the Department of Defense , the Department of Health and Human Services , and apparently the \u201c Ebola team \u201d at the US Agency for International Development have all bought technology from the company ; the platform has also reportedly been used by NASA . Slack is also being used by a unit of technologists \u2014 called the US Digital Service \u2014 based in the president \u2019 s office .\nYour coworkers can also get info on you , though it may not be that interesting\nDo you just have a regular employee Slack account ? You can still get some ( relatively benign ) info on your coworkers via Slack . The first thing you should know is that you can still read all the messages and files that have been posted in public channels before you arrived ( unless they \u2019 ve been deleted ) . Some companies might have content on their Slack systems set to auto-delete regularly , and those deletion periods can be as short as one day .\nBut there \u2019 s a bit you can do through Slack \u2019 s Analytics tab ( go to [ yourworkspace ] .slack.com/stats ) . There , you can see how the percentage of messages \u2014 and views \u2014 are distributed in direct messages , private channels , and public channels on any given day . In a large office , it \u2019 s not clear if this information would tell you much , but in a smaller company , these statistics might be a way for a boss to check whether there \u2019 s been a spike in people talking privately . Another interesting thing you can find out through Slack Analytics is which of your coworkers has sent the most messages of all time or in any given month , though it \u2019 s unclear how useful these stats are .\nIt \u2019 s important to remember that even if your coworkers or even your boss might not have easy access to your private Slack messages , there \u2019 s still a lot they can learn about you based on your profile , like your time zone , your contact information , phone number , location , and social media ( you might volunteer this information on the platform ) . You could also find their member ID number , which might not be too revealing , and files that they \u2019 ve sent by clicking through on their individual profile , which would potentially be more revealing .\nYour employer and coworkers alike can also figure out whether you \u2019 re online , depending on your settings . That little green light ? You can manually turn it off . If you don \u2019 t , Slack tells you if and when you \u2019 ll appear as \u201c active , \u201d depending on what device you \u2019 re on and how you \u2019 re using it .
