Colin Allred : A former NFL linebacker and civil rights attorney , Allred knocked off GOP Rep. Pete Sessions , an entrenched North Texas incumbent . But Allred says there \u2019 s a lot more behind his congressional victory than just a flashy professional football r\u00e9sum\u00e9 . \u201c The impression that people have gotten , I think , around the country is that I was elected because I was a football player . And that \u2019 s not it , \u201d he said . \u201c Football is an icebreaker\u2026 but the other things that I \u2019 ve done and the story that I have growing up in North Texas is really what resonated . \u201d\nAllred told \u2588\u2588\u2588 his goal in Congress is to continue to be a moderate voice in the Democratic Caucus , even as he senses some liberal colleagues are trying to pull the group further to the left . \u201c All of us who come from the red-to-blue districts , we are the closest to where the American people are , \u201d he said . \u201c We \u2019 re trying to make sure that our new members coming from safer districts and the members that are already there understand why we have the majority . \u201d\n2 . Chrissy Houlahan : As the first woman to ever represent Pennsylvania \u2019 s 6th District just outside of Philadelphia , Houlahan is wasting no time trying to move up the Democratic ranks . The incoming freshman is running for a position in House Democratic leadership , telling \u2588\u2588\u2588 her eclectic r\u00e9sum\u00e9 makes her fit for a role on the committee that oversees Democrats ' messaging strategy .\nHoulahan has worn many hats , including as a third-generation veteran , a chemistry teacher , a Stanford-and-MIT-educated engineer and an executive at a basketball apparel company . \u201c The through-line on that is one of service but also one of messaging and marketing , \u201d she said of her career path . Now she hopes to serve as one of three co-chairs of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee in the new Congress . \u201c I feel like I have something to offer and I feel like it \u2019 s OK to offer to put yourself forward and offer to be helpful . \u201d\n3 . Sharice Davids : An Ivy League-educated lawyer and mixed martial arts fighter , Davids triumphed over GOP Rep. Kevin Yoder , scoring Democrats a key victory in deep-red Kansas . Davids is a history-maker in many respects : She \u2019 ll be the only Democrat in Kansas \u2019 six member delegation and is the first woman of color to represent the Sunflower State . She is also Kansas \u2019 first openly gay member and one of two Native American women elected to Congress for the first time . \u201c My story is one of hard work and opportunity , \u201d Davids said in her victory speech , noting she was raised by a single mom who served as a drill sergeant in the Army .\nDavids will be part of a record number of women and a historic number of female candidates of color elected to Congress . \u201c The time for people to not be heard and not be seen and not be listened to or represented well changes now , \u201d she said on election night .\n4 . Harley Rouda : California businessman Rouda defeated GOP Rep. Dana Rohrabacher , a 30-year incumbent who made headlines for his affinity for all things Russia , including its president , Vladimir Putin . Rouda \u2019 s victory helped secure a Democratic sweep of Orange County , once a Republican stronghold home to Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon . Now , Rouda hopes to land a spot on the Transportation or Energy committees so he can focus on his main goal : pushing an infrastructure bill that addresses climate change , he said in an interview .\nRouda told \u2588\u2588\u2588 he and other Democrats are still \u201c a little bit surprised \u201d about the clean sweep in the wealthy California county formerly referred to as the \u201c Orange curtain. \u201d \u201c A lot of people talk about the demographic changes and I think that is one of the key issues , \u201d Rouda said . \u201c [ Also ] , the Republican Party today is very different than the Republican Party under Ronald Reagan . \u201d\n5 . Ayanna Pressley : Like Ocasio-Cortez , Pressley shocked the Democratic establishment by beating Massachusetts Rep. Mike Capuano , a 10-term incumbent , in a heated Democratic primary this year . But unlike Ocasio-Cortez , who affectionately refers to Pressley as part of her \u201c squad \u201d on Instagram , the Massachusetts freshman had a lengthy political r\u00e9sum\u00e9 before being elected to Congress . Pressley worked for former Rep. Joe Kennedy II and then-Sen. John Kerry before being elected to the Boston City Council in 2009 .\n6 . Ben McAdams : McAdams ' victory over GOP Rep. Mia Love in Utah is symbolic of the blue wave that washed over the House , delivering Democrats their largest freshman class since Watergate . McAdams , a mayor in Salt Lake County , surged ahead of Love earlier this week after trailing in votes , delivering Democrats their 234th House seat this cycle .\nMcAdams is one of four incoming House Democrats who joined a dozen current members on a letter promising to vote against Nancy Pelosi for speaker . It \u2019 s unclear if the wall of opposition will hold by the time Democrats cast their votes for speaker on Jan. 3 . Some previous opponents of Pelosi , including fellow signee Rep. Brian Higgins ( D-N.Y. ) , have announced their support after cutting a deal with the longtime Democratic leader . \u201c At this moment all of those folks have leverage and I think they should use it , \u201d Higgins said of fellow anti-Pelosi Democrats . \u201c Unless you have leverage you can \u2019 t use leverage . \u201d\n7 . Lucy McBath : A former flight attendant turned activist , McBath was able to find triumph after tragedy through her congressional victory . McBath became a prominent gun control activist after her teenage son Jordan was killed in 2012 during a dispute at a gas station over loud music . Initially planning to run for a Georgia state House seat , McBath changed her mind and opted to take on freshman GOP Rep. Karen Handel after congressional inaction following the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland , Fla. , earlier this year .\nMcBath \u2019 s win is also a symbolic victory for House Democrats , who funneled millions into a 2017 special election in the district only to come up short . \u201c Never thought I would be here , \u201d McBath tweeted along with a photo of her sitting in her new congressional office . \u201c This is for you , Jordan . And for every single family impacted by gun violence in this country \u2014 let \u2019 s get to work . \u201d",
