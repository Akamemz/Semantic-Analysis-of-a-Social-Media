MUST WATCH The fight over same-sex marriage 04:51\nThe court appeared divided along ideological lines during the arguments about whether DOMA is discriminatory and steps on state marriage laws for gays and lesbians .\nIf legally married homosexuals were being denied more than 1,100 federal benefits , `` what kind of marriage is that ? '' asked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , who said the discriminatory effect is `` pervasive . ''\n`` What gives the federal government the right to define marriage ? '' asked Justice Sonia Sotomayor .\nThe potential swing vote , Justice Anthony Kennedy , also questioned the reach of DOMA , saying it presents a `` real risk of running into traditional state police power to regulate marriage . ''\nKennedy 's point caused court observers to speculate he would join the four normally liberal-leaning justices to create a majority against the act .\nOn the other side , Chief Justice John Roberts repeatedly asked whether it would step on state power to do the opposite of DOMA -- pass a law providing full federal benefits to any legally married same-sex couple .\nWhen Windsor 's lawyer argued in court there was a `` sea change '' afoot today in support of same-sex marriage that leaves DOMA outdated , Roberts said that is because of `` the political effectiveness of those on your side '' swaying public opinion .\nRoberts and Justice Antonin Scalia also suggested DOMA could still remain in place as a valid extension of congressional authority , as 41 states do not allow same-sex marriage .\nPaul Clement , the high-profile lawyer hired by House Speaker John Boehner and fellow Republican legislators to defend DOMA , suggested the act was passed as a `` cautious approach '' in response to initial efforts in some states to change state marriage laws to include homosexuals .\n`` In 1996 something was happening '' in the country , Clement said , adding that Congress wanted to created uniformity in the federal sphere and not sow confusion in states that did not want same-sex marriage .\nHowever , Justice Elena Kagan drew an audible gasp from the packed courtroom by quoting from the official House reports of 17 years ago , when legislators stated one reason to pass DOMA was to `` express moral disapproval '' over gays and lesbians being allowed to wed .\nIt was not until 2004 that Massachusetts became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage .\nNo consensus was reached from the bench on the gateway or jurisdictional questions -- whether House Republicans were on solid legal footing when they stepped in and defended the law after President Barack Obama and his Justice Department reversed their position by concluding DOMA was unconstitutional .\nThe administration changed its mind after initially defending the law before a federal judge hearing the Windsor lawsuit .\nRoberts tweaked Obama for not having `` the courage of conviction '' to continue enforcing the law even if he thought it was discriminatory .\nAt a news conference later Wednesday , House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California called congressional Republicans irresponsible for funding the defense of what she called a discriminatory law at a cost she put at $ 3 million .\n`` On the basis of what I heard , the questions of the justices , the response of the participants , I 'm very optimistic that DOMA will be struck down , '' Pelosi said .\nTo Windsor , Wednesday 's arguments represented another step in the evolving history of gay rights in America .\nFor years , she said , she wore a circle of diamonds as a pin instead of a traditional diamond ring to hide her lesbian relationship from co-workers .\n`` We all lived , really , behind masks and in closets , indeed , '' Windsor explained . `` So what happened is there was , as we increasingly came out , people saw that we did n't have horns . People learned that , okay , we were their kids and their cousins and their friends , all of whom were coming out for the first time . And I think it just , it just grew to where we were human beings like everybody else . And I really think that 's what made the change .

MUST WATCH Fighting to redefine marriage 04:57\nPublic interest remained high outside the court in advance of Wednesday 's session , but not at the same level as Tuesday 's arguments in another case involving California 's voter-approved ban of same-sex marriage .\nA smaller crowd gathered than the day before , with most of them opponents of DOMA .\n`` I 'm here today because I 'm a social worker and I 've seen a lot of people suffer over the years , '' Mary Ann Piet told CNN . `` And I 'm concerned about not getting people their human rights , their dignity as people . ''\nConservative supporters of the law contend it codifies a fundamental cornerstone of society , and changing the definition of marriage would have widespread negative impacts .\nDuring Tuesday 's arguments , the justices seemed to lack consensus on both jurisdictional and constitutional questions relating to the voter-approved California law , known as Proposition 8 , which bans same-sex marriage .\nThe overriding legal question in the California case is whether the Constitution 's guarantee of equal protection under the law prevents states from refusing marriage to a defined class of people .\nWhen it rules , the court could strike down laws across the country banning same-sex marriage , or it could leave the current patchwork of state laws in place , choosing to let state legislatures and state courts sort it all out .\n`` This was a deeply divided Supreme Court , and a court that seemed almost to be groping for an answer here , '' CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin said after the arguments .\nFour of the more liberal justices seemed at least open to the idea that same-sex marriage should be allowed in California . Three of the more conservative justices seemed aligned with the view that marriage should only be for a man and a woman , and it 's likely they 'd be joined by Justice Clarence Thomas , who does n't speak at arguments .\nThat could leave Kennedy as the swing vote , as has often been the case .\nWhile admitting the law 's defenders are `` not just any citizens , '' Kennedy raised concerns about whether just the possibility of same-sex marriage was enough to establish they had suffered harm -- a key jurisdictional hurdle allowing them to appeal in the first place .\nAmong the 41 states that now forbid same-sex marriage , nine of them allow civil partnerships . Nine other states allow same-sex marriage , and about 120,000 same-sex couples have gotten married , according to estimates .\nProhibitions seem to run counter to polls that show rising support overall for same-sex marriage .\nA CNN/ORC International poll released on Monday found 53 % of Americans now support same-sex marriage , up from 40 % in 2007 . As to how the federal government should handle the issue , another CNN/ORC International poll out Tuesday found 56 % of the public feels the federal government should also legally recognize same-sex marriages .",

Three of the more conservative justices seemed aligned with the view that marriage should only be for a man and a woman, and it's likely they'd be joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, who doesn't speak at arguments.\n\nThat could leave Kennedy as the swing vote, as has often been the case.\n\nWhile admitting the law's defenders are \"not just any citizens,\" Kennedy raised concerns about whether just the possibility of same-sex marriage was enough to establish they had suffered harm -- a key jurisdictional hurdle allowing them to appeal in the first place.\n\nNine states permit same-sex marriage\n\nAmong the 41 states that now forbid same-sex marriage, nine of them allow civil partnerships. Nine other states allow same-sex marriage, and about 120,000 same-sex couples have gotten married, according to estimates.\n\nProhibitions seem to run counter to polls that show rising support overall for same-sex marriage.\n\nA CNN/ORC International poll released on Monday found 53% of Americans now support same-sex marriage, up from 40% in 2007. As to how the federal government should handle the issue, another CNN/ORC International poll out Tuesday found 56% of the public feels the federal government should also legally recognize same-sex marriages.",
