Enric Gimenez , a lawyer in Andorra for Salazar , the Venezuelan who prosecutors say brokered many of the contracts , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 his client is innocent of the charges there .\nThe leftist regime founded by Ch\u00e1vez and now led by Maduro is facing its most serious threat yet . Opposition lawmakers , with the support of most Western democracies , say Maduro \u2019 s re-election last year was illegal and that Juan Guaid\u00f3 , head of the National Assembly , is the country \u2019 s rightful leader . Last week , in a failed uprising , Guaid\u00f3 unsuccessfully sought to rally Venezuela \u2019 s military , the lynchpin of support for the unpopular government , against Maduro .\nThe political crisis was prompted by an economic meltdown of hyperinflation , mass unemployment and an exodus of desperate citizens . Venezuelans suffer regular shortages of food , power and water \u2013 basics that were meant to improve through projects like the one in Delta Amacuro . The dire scarcities and dysfunctional projects , the opposition alleges , illustrate how corruption and crony capitalism helped impoverish the once-prosperous country and many of its 30 million people .\nAfter an ambitious 2007 agreement between China and Venezuela , Chinese companies were announced as partners in billions of dollars \u2019 worth of infrastructure and other projects . Since then , China invested over $ 50 billion in Venezuela , mostly in the form of oil-for-loan agreements , government figures show .\nIn a 2017 speech , Maduro said 790 projects with Chinese companies had been contracted in sectors ranging from oil to housing to telecommunications . Of those , he said , 495 were complete . Some developments have stalled because of graft , people familiar with the projects said ; others were derailed by incompetence and a lack of supervision .\nIn Delta Amacuro , even government officials say a mixture of both ruined the rice project . \u201c The government abandoned it , \u201d says Victor Meza , state coordinator for Venezuela \u2019 s rural development agency , which worked with CAMC . \u201c Everything was lost . Everything was stolen . \u201d\nProsecutors in Andorra , where secretive banking laws long made it a tax haven , launched their investigation into Venezuelan laundering amid a broader effort to clean up the local financial sector . The indictment is part of a much larger case in which the prosecutors allege Venezuelan officials between 2009 and 2014 received more than $ 2 billion worth of \u201c illegal commissions \u201d from contractors , state companies , and other sources , often for enabling transactions with the government .\nThe payments , the indictment alleges , passed through accounts held at Banca Privada D \u2019 Andorra , a local bank known as BPA . Andorra \u2019 s government , after the United States accused BPA of money laundering , took over the bank in 2015 . Courts there since then have charged 25 former BPA employees with money laundering in a series of cases , including the one probing the Venezuela contracts . A spokeswoman for Andorra \u2019 s government declined to comment for this article .\nIn addition to the agricultural projects by CAMC , the Andorrans examined two power-plant projects by the company and four other power plants built by Sinohydro Corp , another state-owned Chinese engineering firm . None of those plants ever became fully operational , leaving towns near them subject to regular blackouts .\nSinohydro wasn \u2019 t charged in the indictment . The company didn \u2019 t respond to calls , emails and faxes seeking comment .\nDuring a recent visit by \u2588\u2588\u2588 to Delta Amacuro , the CAMC rice plant remained unfinished . Only one of its 10 silos , half full , held any grain . Some machinery was running , but processing rice imported from Brazil . The nearby paddies lay fallow , the laboratory incomplete , the roads and bridges unbuilt .\nTucupita , a town of 86,000 residents , is Delta Amacuro \u2019 s capital . It hugs the banks of the Ca\u00f1o Manamo , an offshoot of the Orinoco , one of South America \u2019 s biggest rivers . Once , Tucupita was a stop for vessels shipping goods from inland factories to buyers in the Caribbean and beyond .\nIn 1965 , the government dammed the Ca\u00f1o Manamo . Boat traffic stopped , fresh water receded and seawater seeped inland , degrading soils . By the time Ch\u00e1vez became president in 1999 , little farming remained .\n\u201c When I was a kid , there was rice everywhere , \u201d recalled Rogelio Rodr\u00edguez , a local agronomist . \u201c Now we don \u2019 t produce anything . \u201d\nIn 2009 , Ch\u00e1vez and Xi Jinping , China \u2019 s vice president at the time , expanded a joint fund the countries had created with the 2007 development agreement . \u201c Aren \u2019 t we grateful to China ? \u201d Ch\u00e1vez said at a ceremony with Xi at the presidential palace in Caracas , Venezuela \u2019 s capital .\nPromising to supply Beijing with oil \u201c for the next 500 years , \u201d Ch\u00e1vez pointed toward Delta Amacuro on a map . \u201c Look , Xi , \u201d he said , announcing an effort to rehabilitate the region . In attendance were CAMC Chairman Luo Yan and Rafael Ram\u00edrez , a Ch\u00e1vez confidante who ran PDVSA and the oil ministry for a decade .\nDiego Salazar , a cousin of Ram\u00edrez , was well-positioned . Salazar \u2019 s father was a communist guerrilla and author who later became a legislator and Ch\u00e1vez ally . His family ties and connections to lawmakers gave the younger Salazar a valuable address book he wielded at a consulting firm he operated in Caracas .\nThe firm , Inverdt , was owned by a Panama-based holding company he had established called Highland Assets , according to testimony Salazar gave investigators in Andorra when they first began probing his BPA account . From an office a few blocks from PDVSA headquarters , he met often with Ram\u00edrez and other top officials , according to people familiar with his activities .\nRam\u00edrez left the ministry in 2014 and was Venezuela \u2019 s ambassador to the United Nations until 2017 . Since then , Maduro has publicly accused him of unspecified corruption , but Ram\u00edrez wasn \u2019 t indicted in Andorra and hasn \u2019 t formally been charged with any crime in Venezuela . He now lives abroad as an opponent of the government . Ram\u00edrez didn \u2019 t respond to \u2588\u2588\u2588 emails seeking comment and couldn \u2019 t be reached otherwise .\nAt the time of the ceremony with Xi , Ch\u00e1vez was making PDVSA a hub for a growing array of developments , many of them unrelated to oil . A newly created unit known as PDVSA Agr\u00edcola , for instance , was tasked with boosting food supply .\nThe diversification made PDVSA the conduit through which contracts , and a growing sum of money administered by Venezuela \u2019 s national development bank , were awarded . By 2010 , the filings say , the bank had received $ 32 billion from the China Development Bank and another $ 6 billion from an infrastructure fund created by Ch\u00e1vez . China Development Bank didn \u2019 t respond to \u2588\u2588\u2588 requests for comment .\nSalazar began reaching out to Chinese executives , offering his services , as a well-connected consultant , to help broker business in Venezuela . He traveled to China monthly and began paying Venezuelan officials there to forge ties with companies including CAMC . \u201c My work was to convince them , through meetings , trips , and promotion , to sign contracts , \u201d Salazar told Andorran investigators .\nPeople familiar with the case said Salazar and his alleged associates , before the indictment , agreed to testify in Andorra because they hoped to clear their names .\nIn his testimony , Salazar told the Andorran investigators he chose BPA as an offshore bank because he knew other wealthy Venezuelans had done so . Nestled in a quiet valley of the Pyrenees , BPA had a reputation as a discrete money manager for clients from high-risk countries .\nAfter Andorra submitted information requests for its case to Caracas , a Venezuelan court in 2017 ordered Salazar arrested on suspicion of corruption , money laundering and conspiracy .\nCiting the Andorran probe , the Venezuelan arrest order said Salazar sought to \u201c give legal appearance to funds originating from numerous contracts with Venezuelan state institutions. \u201d A trial date hasn \u2019 t been set and Salazar remains jailed in Caracas . A lawyer for Salazar in Venezuela denied the charges before the court .\nGimenez , Salazar \u2019 s lawyer in Andorra , in an email to \u2588\u2588\u2588 said Chinese authorities decided which companies would receive funds and that neither Salazar nor his alleged intermediaries could sway that . Inverdt , Salazar \u2019 s consulting firm , offered \u201c professional \u201d and \u201c technical \u201d services to many Chinese companies , Gimenez wrote in the email , and that \u201c only a handful of those companies were chosen to carry out works . \u201d\nOne of Salazar \u2019 s intermediaries , the indictment alleged , was Francisco Jim\u00e9nez , a career engineer who was PDVSA \u2019 s envoy in Beijing and who the Andorrans indicted along with Salazar . Salazar first contacted him during a trip to China in 2010 , according to testimony Jim\u00e9nez gave in Andorra .\nThat March , Jim\u00e9nez signed a \u201c strategic alliance \u201d with Salazar to promote Inverdt in China . Under the terms of their contract , reviewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588 , Salazar agreed to pay Jim\u00e9nez $ 7.38 million in a BPA account that Inverdt helped open . Bank records in the case files show Jim\u00e9nez later received another $ 7 million .\nJim\u00e9nez , who now lives in Panama , didn \u2019 t respond to phone calls or text messages from \u2588\u2588\u2588 . Salvador Capdevila , his lawyer in Andorra , declined to comment .\nAnother official who prosecutors say helped Salazar was Roc\u00edo Maneiro , Venezuela \u2019 s ambassador to China and now the country \u2019 s ambassador to Britain . Maneiro wasn \u2019 t charged in the Andorran indictment ; numerous court documents , including a filing by prosecutors in relation to her testimony , refer to her as `` under investigation '' for payments they say she received from Salazar and for her alleged role helping him make contacts with Chinese companies .\nIn 2010 , bank records contained in the court documents show , Salazar made a transfer of $ 30,000 to a Chinese account in her name , citing \u201c services provided by Mrs. Maneiro. \u201d Later , Salazar made deposits totaling $ 13 million into a BPA account owned by a Panama-based company that Maneiro , in a disclosure document linked to the account , said belonged to her . An internal report from BPA \u2019 s anti-money laundering committee , reviewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588 , also listed Maneiro as its owner .\nManeiro , through a lawyer and in a text message to \u2588\u2588\u2588 , denied helping Salazar and receiving payments from him . \u201c Those are assertions with no basis , \u201d she wrote in the message . She told an Andorran judge that the signature on the form about the Panamanian company is forged .\nSinohydro , the engineering firm , that March signed a $ 316 million contract with PDVSA to build a power plant near the city of Maracay . In the contract , Sinohydro agreed to pay Salazar a 10 percent fee for helping it \u201c gain a favourable and positive position to pursue the contract. \u201d Bank records in the case files show the company paid $ 49 million into Salazar \u2019 s BPA account and another $ 72 million after Sinohydro secured additional power plant contracts from PDVSA .\nSinohydro eventually built four plants , but none met full contract specifications , engineers say . The plant near Maracay , for example , was meant to generate as much as 382 megawatts , the contract shows . Instead , the plant is producing no more than 140 megawatts , according to Jos\u00e9 Aguilar , a former director at Venezuela \u2019 s state power company .\nSoon , Salazar \u2019 s company was earning over $ 100 million a year , according to testimony by him and several aides . \u201c He had a briefcase full of contracts , \u201d Luis Mariano Rodr\u00edguez , a Salazar deputy also charged in the indictment , told Andorran investigators .",
