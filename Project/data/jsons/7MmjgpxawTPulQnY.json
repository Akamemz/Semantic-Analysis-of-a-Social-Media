In his campaign kickoff speech last year , he accused President Donald Trump of fanning , rather than working to bridge , partisan and racial divides \u2013 evoking a nation that , in his view , was yearning to come together .\n\u201c The country is sick of the division .

We need to remember that today , I think more than any time in my career . \u201d\nMr. Biden \u2019 s decisive primary victories earlier this spring seemed to affirm that view . But as the campaign now moves into the general election phase \u2013 after a stretch of tumultuous events nearly unprecedented in modern U.S. history \u2013 the task of unifying the nation has never seemed more daunting .\nThe past three months have upended politics as usual , with the pandemic taking more than 100,000 American lives and sending the economy into a tailspin that has left millions unemployed . Over the past two weeks , the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police has sparked massive protests for racial justice across the country .\nFor Mr. Biden , the volatile landscape is presenting an increasingly challenging balancing act . He is under renewed pressure to shore up support among progressives who have been less enthusiastic about his candidacy , without alienating the swing voters who had been moving in his direction . Above all , he must somehow convince a fractured and exhausted nation that the problems it faces are fixable \u2013 and that finding consensus on those challenges is both possible and desirable .\n\u201c He \u2019 s being challenged to balance all these things , because Trump has so utterly failed to balance them , \u201d says Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware . \u201c This is a moment that demands leadership from someone who understands how to respond to a pandemic and bring us together . ... I think [ Mr. Biden ] is exactly the right man for the moment . \u201d\nMr. Biden has seized multiple opportunities in recent weeks to try to cast himself as a healer in chief .\nOn the same day U.S. Park Police in Washington cleared a group of peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square with tear gas and rubber bullets so that Mr. Trump could pose for a photograph outside historic St. John \u2019 s Church , Mr. Biden was sitting in a black church in Wilmington , Delaware , listening to community leaders from 6 feet away .\nLess than 24 hours later , Mr. Biden gave a speech in Philadelphia to a country he described as \u201c crying out for leadership. \u201d He called on Congress to enact a law banning police chokeholds and to create \u201c a model use-of-force standard. \u201d He also promised to create a national police oversight commission .\nOn Monday , Mr. Biden was scheduled to meet privately with the Floyd family , and he is expected to attend Mr. Floyd \u2019 s funeral in Houston on Tuesday .\n\u201c Biden is calming at a time when people are hearing nothing but nasty noise , and that juxtaposition is to his advantage , \u201d says Jeff Link , an Iowa-based political consultant who has advised several Democratic presidential candidates . \u201c Biden doesn \u2019 t have to outshout Trump , but he has to show how he \u2019 s different . \u201d\nMr. Biden has deep reservoirs of affection in the African American community , among whom he built enduring relationships during the Obama years . It was black voters who carried him to a resounding win in South Carolina , reviving a candidacy that had appeared to be on its last legs , and ultimately helping make him the Democratic nominee . He officially secured the 1,991 delegates needed to claim the nomination this weekend .\nBut he is viewed less favorably by a younger , more left-wing generation , which sees him as too moderate to bring about needed change . Mr. Biden does not support calls to \u201c defund the police , \u201d which has become a rallying cry on the left in recent days . While he favors increased spending on other social programs , his campaign said Monday , he wants to increase , not decrease , police budgets for things like body cameras and training .\nMr. Biden has long-standing ties to union groups , including cops and firefighters , some of which have been trending more conservative in recent election cycles , and which Democrats were hoping to win back this year . In recent days , some law enforcement groups have expressed unhappiness with what they see as Mr. Biden \u2019 s failure to demonstrate sufficient support for their side , showing just how difficult it may be for him \u2013 or anyone \u2013 to bridge those divides .\nIn a poll released last week by Monmouth University , 89 % of Democrats said they had \u201c no confidence at all \u201d in Mr. Trump \u2019 s ability to handle race relations . But only 32 % of Democrats had a \u201c great deal \u201d of confidence in Mr. Biden on the matter . Among Republicans , 58 % had a great deal of confidence in Mr. Trump , while 58 % had no confidence at all in Mr. Biden .\nProtesters gathering around a graffitied Robert E. Lee statue in Richmond , Virginia , last week said recent events had heightened their expectations of Mr. Biden from just two weeks ago .\n\u201c He thinks he \u2019 s automatically got the black vote because he was the right-hand man to a black president , \u201d says Chenae Kirkland . \u201c But he \u2019 s got to have a hand in these police departments , show us what he \u2019 d do , \u201d adds her friend Leshayne Vialet , both bank employees .\nMaking promises is better than a photo op , they say \u2013 but it \u2019 s not enough .\nSome express concerns about Mr. Biden \u2019 s own track record during his 36-year career in the Senate . In the 1970s , he was a vocal opponent of school busing , and he helped write the 1994 crime bill , which many believe was a key contributor to mass incarceration that has disproportionately affected black men .\n\u201c I felt like he was involved with all the stuff that \u2019 s led to where we are now , \u201d says Andre Lynch , an Uber driver , gesturing to the dozens of activists climbing up the Lee statue . He adds , \u201c When he ends up running this country , he \u2019 ll have a chance to redeem himself , especially after watching all of this unfold . \u201d\nOf course , to have that opportunity , Mr. Biden needs to win the election . Recent polls have shown him gaining ground against the president . According to a Fox News survey , Mr. Biden is now ahead in Wisconsin , Ohio , and Arizona \u2013 all battleground states the president won in 2016 , while the Monmouth poll has Mr. Biden with an 11-point lead over Mr. Trump overall . But these polls are mostly about Mr. Trump , says Patrick Murray , director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute .\n\u201c More so than any prior incumbent election , this is a referendum , \u201d Mr. Murray says . But Mr. Biden still has to \u201c get out there \u201d and prove himself to Democratic voters .\nAnd Mr. Biden faces unique challenges when it comes to unifying his party , not least because of COVID-19 , says Robert Shrum , a longtime Democratic strategist and director of the University of Southern California \u2019 s Center for the Political Future . For three months , all campaign rallies have been canceled or turned into awkward \u201c virtual \u201d events , making it difficult for a candidate who thrives on rope lines and personal connections to reach voters .\nThe nominee \u2019 s acceptance speech at the party convention is typically an important moment , notes Mr. Shrum . \u201c Just look at Al Gore in 2000 , \u201d he says . \u201c He gained 15 to 18 points in 47 minutes. \u201d But this year \u2019 s Democratic convention is increasingly looking like it will be held online , diminishing Mr. Biden \u2019 s ability to generate a big bounce .\nIt \u2019 s also unclear if televised debates between the candidates will happen . In a debate , Mr. Biden would have an opportunity to try to blunt Mr. Trump \u2019 s charges that the former vice president is \u201c senile \u201d and \u201c sleepy , \u201d just as John F. Kennedy countered Richard Nixon \u2019 s claims that he was too young and inexperienced to assume the presidency in 1960 .\nIn the potential absence of these traditional events , Mr. Biden will need to be creative in how he engages voters , says Mr. Shrum . And his vice presidential pick will likely carry even more weight \u2013 not only because of Mr. Biden \u2019 s age , but also because of the absence of other high-profile campaign moments .\nAbove all , say several strategists , Mr. Biden needs to try to stay in the public eye as he has over the past week , and propose policies that follow through on his promise to bring unity .\n\u201c Part of [ Mr. Trump \u2019 s ] strategy will be to undermine voters \u2019 confidence in Joe Biden , \u201d says Monmouth \u2019 s Mr. Murray . \u201c That \u2019 s why Biden has to be out there \u2013 so he can change people \u2019 s minds from \u2018 I think he can do a good job \u2019 to \u2018 I know he can do a good job . \u2019 \u201d\nAt the same time , Mr. Biden has made a point throughout the campaign of keeping the focus less on himself and more on the country .\nIn 2019 , Mr. Biden \u2019 s campaign announcement video was centered on Charlottesville , Virginia , where two years earlier white supremacists had shocked the nation as they marched with tiki torches . In the video , Mr. Biden referenced Mr. Trump \u2019 s response to the event as a key moment that pushed him to run for president .\n\u201c We are in a battle for the soul of this nation , \u201d he said . \u201c We can \u2019 t forget what happened in Charlottesville .
