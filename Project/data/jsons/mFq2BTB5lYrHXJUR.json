I cannot go back.\" (Photo: Maranie R.

The makeshift campsite stretches for a quarter of a mile and is juxtaposed against the urban streets of Matamoros.\n\nUnder the bridge that divides the two countries, mothers bathe their children in the Rio Grande and fathers wash clothing, utensils, and their own bodies. The river is known to be contaminated with E. coli and other bacteria, but it offers a momentary reprieve from the chaos, fear, and uncertainty of the wait.\n\nImelda, age 8, washes her clothes in the Rio Grande River. She has not been able to attend school for the last 7 months as her family waits to have their asylum claim processed. Asked what she wants for her future Imelda responded,\"I want to be a teacher someday.\" (Photo: Maranie R.

There are fire pits used for cooking, a long row of porta potties, and portable sinks for washing hands and dishes.\n\nThe team of volunteers, many from Brownsville and some from across the country, are among several thousand who have stepped in to fill the void left by absent governments to provide food, medical care, clothing and shelter. Volunteers with Team Brownsville, Angry Tias and Abuelas, and The Resource Center Matamoros are three core groups that regularly provide aid, but each has also welcomed volunteers from throughout the United States and Europe.\n\nThe days in the Matamoros camp are monotonous and the nights are in a tent shared with others, often damp and quickly becoming unable to keep out the cold. Griselda is 7 and spends most afternoons coloring. She and her mother, father and younger brother have been waiting since September for their first asylum hearing. (Photo: Maranie R.

Several hundred backpacks labelled with each child\u2019s name were distributed to an excited mob of tiny, outstretched hands. Each contained age-appropriate books, the gift requested and a tiny reading lamp. With little light at night and no security or proper school, the books and nightlights aim to encourage children to read within the relative safety of their tents.\n\nFollowing their visit with Santa a projector played a Spanish Christmas movie for a group of fifty young children. The side of a large shipping container that doubles as a medical clinic during the day served as the screen. (Photo: Maranie R. Staab)\n\nThough each group meets slightly different needs, come Christmastime their collective aim is to bring something of a holiday to families and children living in limbo.\n\nThis year adults and children alike stand in line with paper plates to receive traditional American food, cups of Kool-Aid, and sit together on the concrete curb that surrounds the main plaza.\n\nBy 10 p.m. on Christmas Eve families returned to their respective tents. Some used the remaining battery life in their holiday necklaces to light a few more minutes together before darkness fell. (Photo: Maranie R. Staab/VICE News)\n\nAs dusk turns to darkness, the three hundred children draped with battery-powered necklaces of lights provide a colorful spectacle as they run about the grounds. Jingle bells and \"Feliz Navidad\" plays from a speaker someone has connected to their phone.\n\nThe grounds were lit only by distant stadium lights, smoldering campfires, and the soft glow of red and green Christmas lights.

Following the Trump administration's Migrant Protection Protocol, asylum-seekers from Spanish-speaking countries must remain in Mexico while their claims are processed. (Photo: Maranie R.
