    "content": "In the interest of intellectual honesty and transparency , let 's begin with a few important concessions to skeptics of the GOP tax reform bill : First , not every single American would be a winner under the plan . A small percentage of US taxpayers would see a tax increase ( disproportionately , these would be higher-income itemizers from high-tax states ) , and a number of deductions that help certain people with heavy medical expenses and student loan debt would be eliminated ( proponents say much or all of the resulting blow would be mitigated by lower rates and a doubled standard deduction ) . Second , among the `` losers '' would be a small percentage of middle class families and filers . Third , even using a `` dynamic '' score of the legislation -- which takes into account the growth-stimulating effects of tax cuts and simplification -- it is likely that the plan would add hundreds of billions to cumulative federal deficits over the next decade . The debt matters . Fourth , some Republicans believe the plan is too tilted toward corporate tax reductions ( the current US statuary and effective rates are internationally uncompetitive ) , arguing that a small portion of those planned cuts should be redirected to families with children .\nThere is partisan retort to each of those first three criticisms , of course : The Democratic Party lied to the American people by promising a no-lose panacea under Obamacare , which ended up harming more people than it helped , while gut-punching millions of middle class families with skyrocketing Obamacare costs and taxes . And Obama 's party , now feigning suddenly concern about deficits , cheered loudly as he nearly doubled the national debt in the span of just eight years . These points highlight Democrats ' hypocrisy and opportunism ; they do not , however , invalidate the concerns listed above , on the merits . The fundamental question as Senators contemplate their chamber 's legislation is whether the drawbacks of the bill outweigh its benefits . I believe they do not , but in order to at least reach a point of forming rational opinions , it 's imperative that we expose and correct dishonest myths about the effects of tax reform . These are the two biggest falsehoods being propagated by the Left :\n( 1 ) The GOP tax reform proposals do not help the middle class . This is flat-out wrong , period . As we 've explored in great detail , with links to actual data , the vast majority of all taxpayers would receive a tax cut under the Republican plan , including roughly 75 percent of middle income households ( others would see no change , and a small fraction would see an increase ) . This is especially true for the massive majority of middle class filers who take the standard deduction , which is set to roughly increase twofold under the legislation . As we wrote earlier , even the New York Times ' analysis of the bill -- evidently unread by the paper 's editorial board -- can not escape the empirical fact that a lopsided supermajority of middle class earners stand to benefit from tax relief . I 've also cited two nonpartisan analyses of the House-passed bill that determined it would lower taxes and increase incomes , on average , across every income group in America ( see the above links ) . In doing so , I 've highlighted the work of the nonpartisan Tax Foundation to illustrate these benefits , which some liberals have dismissed because of that organization 's reputation for leaning to the right . For the purposes of this argument , therefore , let 's look at findings from the ideologically liberal Tax Policy Center ( TPC ) . It found that the House-passed legislation would reduce average tax bills across all five income groups from 2019 to 2027 ( the end of the budget window ) . How about the Senate bill ?\nChart from left-leaning Tax Policy Center shows Senate GOP reform bill would INCREASE after-tax incomes in '19 & '25 for * every single * income group . Yellow bar ( '27 projection ) assumes highly implausible total expiration of middle class cuts ( see now-permanent Bush tax cuts ) : pic.twitter.com/7268PrtWlH \u2014 Guy Benson ( @ guypbenson ) November 30 , 2017\nThe blue and red bars demonstrate how taxpayers in every single income quintile , including the middle three , will see their after-tax incomes rise , due to the plan 's tax cuts -- both immediately and in the medium-term . As I mention in the tweet , the yellow bar ( the basis for nearly all of the misleading scare-mongering you 're hearing from the Left on this front ) assumes that Congress would allow all of the middle class cuts to expire after 2025 . I 've previously elucidated why that outcome is unlikely in the extreme , but here 's Manhattan Institute Senior Fellow Brian Riedl fortifying the case persuasively and succinctly . Please read every sentence of this paragraph carefully , as it 's packed with relevant information :\nA Tax Policy Center analysis of the Senate bill reveals that three-quarters of all families would get a tax cut . Just 12 percent would see a tax increase \u2014 and they are concentrated among the rich . The average middle-income family would receive a tax cut of approximately $ 850 per year through 2025 . At that point , Congress would have to vote to extend most of the family tax cuts . This vote would probably be a formality , as a similar vote five years ago to extend the Bush tax cuts for middle-class families passed the Senate 89\u20138 . There is no appetite in Congress to steeply raise middle-class taxes . Even in the worst-case scenario , where the cuts fully expire , the typical middle-income family would receive a cumulative $ 7,000 tax cut in the early years , followed by a ( roughly ) $ 100 annual tax increase later . Still a good deal . How do critics portray this as a middle-class tax hike ? By simply ignoring the $ 7,000 tax cut in the early years , assuming a full expiration after 2025 , and then implying that the later tax hike is much larger . That is flat-out dishonest .\n( 2 ) The GOP tax reform proposals are just another giveaway to `` the rich . '' President Trump insisted that millionaires and billionaires not see their income tax rate slashed under the GOP plan , and he got his way in the House-passed bill ( the Senate bill would reduce the top tax bracket rate by just one point ) . That still has n't stopped the Left from endlessly repeating their favorite talking point about any and every Republican tax idea ever proposed . First , I 'll remind you that `` the rich '' already pay a disproportionately high percentage of America 's tax tab . The data spells out how they contribute their `` fair share '' ( another popular buzz phrase ) , and then some . Of course an across-the-board tax cut and reform plan will benefit many of the people who are shoveling mounds of cash out the door and into Uncle Sam 's bottomless coffers . But can the Senate plan be broadly construed as a sweetheart deal for the very rich ? Back to Riedl 's analysis -- which , again , is rooted in numbers from the liberal TPC :\nEven a proportional tax cut will save wealthier families more money . In 2013 ( the latest year for which data are available ) , the typical family in the top 1 percent paid $ 420,000 in federal income taxes . The top 20 percent averaged $ 47,000 , and the typical middle-income family paid $ 2,000 . The bottom 40 percent collectively paid zero income tax . It is not easy to give the largest income-tax cuts to those who already pay no income tax . That said , the Senate bill would make the tax code even more progressive . The bottom 80 percent of families currently pay 33 percent of all combined federal taxes , yet would get 37 percent of the tax cuts . By contrast , the top 1 percent currently pays 27 percent of all federal taxes but would get just 18 percent of the tax cuts . The result would be wealthy families paying a larger portion of the federal tax burden .\nSo where do statistics like this `` 62 percent of cuts to the top one percent '' assertion come from ?\n\u201c Your tax plan has 36 % of it going to the richest 1 % in America . I don \u2019 t do that '' is a thing McCain said in 2000 to GWBush . McCain went on to vote against both the 2001 & 2003 Bush cuts .\nWell , current Senate bill has 62 % of cuts going to top 1 % . https : //t.co/houHwoEcPb \u2014 Catherine Rampell ( @ crampell ) November 29 , 2017\nThat data point relies on the `` yellow bar '' assumption described earlier . She skips the entire part about undisputed middle class tax cuts over the next eight years , and jumps to a fictional 2027 universe in which Congress has green-lit a big tax increase on the middle class , leaving the remaining playing field slanted toward `` the rich . '' This is misleading sleight-of-hand that looks intended to fool gullible people and whip up under-informed outrage . Another example of that phenomenon :\nNEW : Leaked JCT report shows only 62 % of Americans get a tax cut of $ 100 or more from the Senate GOP plan in 2019 . Rest would pay about the same or more .\nAmong people earning $ 50k to $ 75k , 10 % would face tax hike of $ 100 or morehttps : //t.co/9kz5vjzLIv pic.twitter.com/lS6IJdEt3q \u2014 Heather Long ( @ byHeatherLong ) November 29 , 2017\nUsing basic arithmetic , many people might conclude this also means that 38 percent of Americans would see a tax increase . Wrong :\nThis does n't say nearly what you think it says . Roughly 1/3 of filers have no tax liability , so roughly 1/3 of filers getting no tax cut is not at all surprising . There 's no tax to cut . https : //t.co/gfRuvkt3ld \u2014 amoylan ( @ amoylan ) November 30 , 2017\nTo recap : The data proves that the overwhelming majority of all taxpayers ( including , if not especially , the middle class ) would get a tax cut under the bill , which would also significantly improve the US business climate for corporations and small businesses , resulting in faster economic growth and nearly one million new full-time American jobs . What it would not do -- contrary to some of the scurrilous rumors and baseless claims flying around -- is create special new `` tax breaks '' for private jet owners , eliminate the popular mortgage interest deduction , or `` kick millions off of healthcare '' ( a distortion that doubles as a bogus claim that poor people would get slapped with `` tax increases '' under the legislation ) . I 'm not here to tell you the Republican plan is perfect . I 'm here to tell you that some of the most frequently-repeated attacks from the Left against the plan are either entirely unsupported by evidence , or rest on out-of-context data points that seem to have been deliberately cherry-picked in order to mislead people .",
