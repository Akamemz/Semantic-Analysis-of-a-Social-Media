It was an odd but interesting challenge .\nWhen you accept it , the view from there is a series of unhappy flashbacks . It starts with Trump \u2019 s 2016 campaign being investigated by the FBI . Before he took office , then bureau Director James Comey showed Trump parts of the Steele dossier , calling it \u201c salacious and unverified . \u201d\nSaid Sekulow , \u201c It was so salacious and unverified , the FBI had used it to get FISA warrants \u201d to spy on the campaign .\nWithin weeks of taking office , Trump fired Comey and special counsel Robert Mueller was appointed , starting a two-year probe that hung over the Trump White House like a giant cloud before coming up empty . Along the way , FBI agent Peter Strzok and his office paramour , lawyer Lisa Page , became household names for their texts about an \u201c insurance policy \u201d in case Trump won and the \u201c smell \u201d of his voters .\nSekulow didn \u2019 t mention many details as he hurried down memory lane , aiming to get to the point that the impeachment case \u201c didn \u2019 t occur in a vacuum. \u201d Seizing on the Ukraine issue , he suggested , was just the latest stage of the relentless effort by Democrats to block Trump from getting to the White House , and then knock him out after he got there .\nIt was an effective approach that built on the defense team \u2019 s two days of skillful and strategic answers to the House Democrats \u2019 case . But Sekulow was also making a larger point , namely about the disastrous impact the anti-Trump agenda is having on our nation , and will have , perhaps , for generations .\nNever in modern times has there been such a nasty , permanent campaign to thwart and take out a president . The effort has taught a new generation of Americans that Dems are ruthless and have two enormous advantages , and both have played major roles in the anti-Trump campaign .\nThat the permanent bureaucracy leans left has never been a secret . But the shockingly brazen role of the FBI , the CIA and others in the law enforcement and intelligence agencies convinced me that the term \u201c deep state \u201d is indeed appropriate .\nSome , including Comey and former CIA leader John Brennan , were so clearly abusing their offices and , later , their knowledge and contacts to destabilize the administration that it is hard to look at those agencies without wondering if other snakes are still at work . The continuing leaks suggest they are , with the reports about John Bolton \u2019 s manuscript the latest example .\nThe other Dem advantage is the media . It , too , has always leaned left , but the bias involved in demonizing Trump and his supporters is unlike anything we \u2019 ve ever seen .\nRight out of the gate , it was obvious that the same media that had served as cheerleaders for the Obama administration were committed to stopping Trump .
