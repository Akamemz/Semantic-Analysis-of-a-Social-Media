ET : The Senate voted against completing the Keystone pipeline .\nThe remaining portion of the Keystone pipeline project , if completed , will be fewer than 1,200 miles long \u2014 just a fraction of the existing 2.6 million miles of oil and gas pipelines running beneath our feet in the United States .\nBut the pipeline , which would stretch from Alberta , Canada , to the Gulf of Mexico , is at the center of a years-long , contentious debate among politicians , energy companies and environmentalists .\nA Senate vote approving completion of the pipeline is scheduled for Tuesday \u2014 less than one week after the House approved the same legislation .

That means President Obama may soon have a chance to sign off on the pipeline \u2014 or to veto it.\n\nBefore Tuesday's vote, here are a few things to help you make sense of the Keystone XL debate:\n\nHow much of the pipeline is completed, and what will it do?\n\nAbout 40 percent of the total project has been built so far, in two segments: a 298-mile stretch from Steele City, Neb., to Cushing, Okla., and a 485-mile segment between Cushing and Nederland, Texas. Oil is flowing through these pipelines from the increased production currently happening in the middle of the U.S.\n\nProposed And Existing TransCanada Pipelines\n\nThe remaining segment, if approved, would run between Alberta and Steele City. If fully completed, the Keystone XL pipeline would be able to move up to 830,000 barrels a day of crude from Canada's oil sands south to the U.S. Gulf Coast.

A pipeline is the least expensive way for the industry to do that.\n\nWhat are the environmental concerns?\n\nProducing crude from oil sands emits an estimated 17 percent more greenhouse gases than traditional oil drilling in the U.S. In part, that's because it has to be heated to separate the crude from the sand.\n\nEarlier this year, the State Department released an environmental review that concluded the Keystone XL very likely wouldn't have a significant effect on greenhouse gas emissions because the oil will ultimately be produced, even if the pipeline is not built.

One thing is clear: Once construction is finished in about two years, the pipeline would create only about 50 new permanent jobs.\n\nWhere does President Obama stand on the pipeline?\n\nThe president has unusual leverage over this pipeline. Because it crosses the U.S. border with Canada, Keystone XL requires a \"presidential permit.\" Obama has guarded that power jealously. Three years ago, when Congress tried to force him to make a decision by issuing a 60-day deadline, he simply rejected the permit application.\n\nThe political challenge for Obama is that Democrats are genuinely divided on the issue, with construction unions favoring the project and some environmental activists opposing it. No matter what he decides, some constituents will be unhappy \u2014 so the president has basically stalled.\n\nIf the legislation passes the Senate Tuesday and becomes law, the pipeline would get an immediate green light.\n\nWhy was there a State Department review of the project, and what is its status?\n\nThe State Department was required to conduct an environmental assessment of the final, proposed leg of the pipeline because it will cross the U.S.-Canada border.\n\nThe State Department is waiting for the outcome of a Nebraska Supreme Court case that could affect the pipeline's route, but the department's basic environmental review was completed in January.\n\nIt concluded that the pipeline would have \"little impact\" on the price consumers pay for gasoline in the U.S. It also concluded that blocking the pipeline would reduce income for tar sands developers, \"but not enough to curtail most oil sands growth plans or to shut-in existing production.\" Reviewers cautioned that blocking the pipeline could have a bigger effect on tar sands development if oil prices drop into the $65- to $75-per-barrel range.

Producers in Canada are pursuing transporting oil sands by rail cars, even though it's more expensive than moving it by pipeline.\n\nThat becomes even less attractive as world oil prices fall, however.
