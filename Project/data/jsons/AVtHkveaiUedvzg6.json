Dan Erickson and Artin Massihi , who run a private urgent-care clinic in Bakersfield , California , on Monday because they claim it violated their user policy by disputing health officials .\nBut the move has been blasted as censorship and a worrying sign of big tech companies trying to control information during the pandemic and quashing free speech .\nSocial media giants Facebook and Twitter are also coming under increasing scrutiny for removing posts that they say contain health misinformation or calls to break stay-at-home orders .\nThe hour-long video with Drs Erickson and Massihi suggesting stay-at-home orders are damaging drew a massive audience , garnering more than five million views before it was removed .\nUsing testing stats from their urgent care centers , they argue that the mortality rate for coronavirus is minuscule and that lockdowns are disruptive to normal healthcare provision , the functioning of healthy immune systems and are devastating to the economy .\nThe doctors also share anecdotes , which they say come from colleagues in hospitals , claiming that there is pressure to add COVID-19 as a cause of death to unrelated fatalities to artificially boost the death toll .\n'It 's time to open back up . The science says it is . The models we 've been using from predictions , to predict the amount of disease , are not accurate , ' Erikson said in the press conference .\nTesla CEO Musk , an increasingly outspoken critic of lockdowns , shared the video on Twitter before it was taken down , adding the comment , 'Docs make good points .
