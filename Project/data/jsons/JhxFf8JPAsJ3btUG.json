Most expect a series of photo ops , but no serious progress on the three major issues : the Iran nuclear threat , the implosion of Syria , and the moribund Israeli-Palestinian peace process .\n\u201c It is hard for me to recall a less-anticipated trip to Israel by an American president , \u201d noted Thomas L. Friedman in his recent column in the New York Times . \u201c But there is a message in that empty bottle : Little is expected from this trip \u2014 not only because little is possible , but because , from a narrow U.S. point of view , little is necessary . \u201d\nActually , much is necessary . The president needs to \u201c re-set \u201d U.S.-Israeli relations in a positive way after a contentious relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the first term . But that is the just the beginning .\nThere are three critical questions the president needs to answer on this trip :\nHave diplomacy , sanctions and covert operations failed to stop Iran from building nuclear weapons ? If so , will President Obama order airstrikes against Iran , or give Israel the \u201c green light \u201d to hit Iran \u2019 s nuclear sites since other measures have failed ? If not , why not ?\nUnfortunately , the administration has sent mixed messages in recent days .\nOn March 4 , Vice President Joe Biden told the AIPAC Policy Conference the president is committed to preventing Iran from getting the bomb , and pointedly noted that the \u201c window is closing \u201d for diplomacy and sanctions work .\n\u201c Let me make clear what that commitment is : It is to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon , \u201d said Biden . \u201c Period . End of discussion . Prevent \u2014 not contain \u2014prevent\u2026.Big nations can \u2019 t bluff\u2026.And President Barack Obama is not bluffing . \u201d\nThe next day , however , Secretary of State John Kerry sent different signals . He confirmed that Iran is getting closer to having nuclear weapons . He conceded that \u201c lines have been drawn before and they 've been passed . That 's why the president has been so definitive this time. \u201d But Kerry did not echo Biden \u2019 s hard line . Rather , he said the president wants to \u201c avoid any consideration of any kind of military action . \u201d\nThat same day , U.S. CENTCOM commander General James Mattis testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee . He was asked , \u201c In your professional opinion , are the current diplomatic and economic efforts to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons capability -- are they working ? \u201d His answer was blunt . \u201c No , sir. \u201d Then he said he was working on \u201c other options \u201d for the President .\nLast week , President Obama was interviewed by Israel \u2019 s Channel 2 . He said there is still \u201c a year or so \u201d until Iran builds an operational nuclear bomb .\nWas the president indicating time is running out and that military action might need to be taken soon , or that there is still plenty of time to keep trying diplomacy and sanctions ?\nMr. Netanyahu famously told the U.N. General Assembly last fall that the \u201c red line \u201d \u2013 the point at which Israel would be forced to launch preemptive strikes or risk allowing Tehran to get The Bomb \u2013 would be reached by spring or summer 2013 . Today , senior Israeli officials confirm the red line is approaching .\n\u201c Iran \u2019 s nuclear program is advancing slower then they planned , but it is moving , \u201d says Major General Aviv Kochavi , director of Israeli military intelligence . \u201c At their current pace of enrichment of 14 kilograms of uranium per month , Iran would be able to manufacture five to six nuclear bombs , if the order is given . \u201d\nThe problem , noted Kochavi , is that the military option that world leaders say is \u201c on the table \u201d is not being taken seriously by Tehran . \u201c Iran does not see a high likelihood of an attack on its nuclear facilities by the international community , \u201d he noted at a recent security conference in Israel .\nNetanyahu is ready to launch a massive preemptive military strike soon , and alone , if need be .
