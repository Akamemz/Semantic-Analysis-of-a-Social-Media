Tucked within the study , however , is a figure that some analysts say is far more important than month-to-month job figures : The number of Americans working or searching for a job has dropped to its lowest point in 38 years .\nJust 62.6 percent of working-age Americans are participating in the labor force . Participants are defined as those who have a job or are actively seeking one .\nThose who are not seeking work are not counted in monthly jobless figures , meaning unemployment rates can fall even though the number of Americans getting paychecks stays flat or drops .\nThe troubling numbers cast doubt on the White House \u2019 s continued claim that Mr. Obama \u2019 s policies have rescued the economy and put it on firm footing moving forward .
