    "content": "The United States and North Korea have spent the past week scrambling to reschedule a June 12 summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un . If it takes place , it will be among the most memorable moments in recent US diplomatic history .\nBut what might actually happen if the two leaders meet ? According to experts , there are four broad scenarios that could play out \u2014 each with vastly different and potentially dangerous consequences .\nThe first and most likely scenario is that Trump and Kim could agree to a broad framework for a nuclear deal at the meeting , and then allow their aides to work out the details over a longer period of time .\nSecond , the two leaders might agree to major concessions , like North Korea reducing its nuclear arsenal and the US removing troops from South Korea , but ultimately fall short of agreeing to dismantle Pyongyang \u2019 s entire nuclear program . That would still be a huge development , and possibly a diplomatic win for both sides .\nThird , Trump and Kim agree to nothing . That would a scary outcome , as it would waste an opportunity to solve the nuclear standoff diplomatically \u2014 and may compel Trump and Kim to threaten war once again .\nFinally , and by far the least likely option , North Korea acquiesces to Trump \u2019 s demands and agrees to completely dismantle its nuclear program .\nThis wide range of possible outcomes \u2014 from unlikely to practical to catastrophic \u2014 means the stakes for the Trump-Kim summit couldn \u2019 t be higher . After all , the reason they are talking is , in part , to avoid a horrific war .\nThis , experts tell me , is the most likely outcome of a Trump-Kim summit .\n\u201c What we should be expecting is ... a mutually agreed-upon outline for how the process moves forward , a sense of realistic timing , and some principles of what elements absolutely need to be included in an agreement from both sides , \u201d Jenny Town , a Koreas expert at the Stimson Center , told me . \u201c Then it gets handed down to negotiators to work out the details . \u201d\nIn practice , this is the start of the deal . Trump and Kim would effectively be creating a road map for future negotiations , while offering up the usual diplomatic boilerplate .\nThat would still give staffers , like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , a chance to find common ground . It \u2019 s possible that if both sides agree to more specific nuclear details down the line , Trump and Kim could meet again and finalize a more robust deal .\nBut neither leader will want to leave the meeting empty-handed , so they might offer up a symbolic concession to kick-start a much longer process . Trump could relax some of the tough sanctions placed on North Korea , and Pyongyang , meanwhile , might destroy some of its missiles \u2014 but not the ones that could reach the United States .\nThere would not be much to celebrate immediately , but it would hopefully serve as the beginning of a much grander opportunity for both countries to negotiate an end to the nuclear standoff \u2014 and avoid a horrific outcome .\nThere is a chance \u2014 albeit small \u2014 that Trump and Kim agree to something quite dramatic .\nMintaro Oba , a former State Department official who focused on North Korea , told me that Pyongyang could agree to significant curbs on its nuclear program as long as the US offers something extraordinary in return . Here are two possibilities :\nNorth Korea could agree to freeze or reduce its nuclear arsenal but not completely dismantle its entire weapons program . North Korea could agree to allow international inspectors to visit the country frequently to ensure it has stopped improving its nuclear and missile programs .\nEither of those would be significant developments , since the country would be effectively decreasing its military power and reducing its threat to US allies like South Korea and Japan .\nBut what would the US have to do in exchange ?\n\u201c I think it could be any combination of financial assistance , security guarantees , and a path toward normalization of relations , \u201d says Oba . \u201c I think the latter matters a lot to North Koreans , and they would welcome the establishment of liaison offices and more . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s a crucial point : North Korea has long craved recognition from the United States . Sitting down with Trump makes North Korea look like a legitimate country . But establishing formal diplomatic ties with Washington , including sending a recognized ambassador to the US , would make it seem like a normal country in America \u2019 s eyes .\nTrump could also agree to remove some of the 28,500 US troops in South Korea , something he has repeatedly said he wanted to do . Pyongyang sees those troops as a possible invading force , but Seoul considers them a security guarantee against a possible North Korean attack . To satisfy Kim and make some sort of deal , Trump may choose to harm the US-South Korea alliance .\nLet \u2019 s be clear : This would probably be the worst overall outcome .\nTrump and Kim spent an inordinate amount of time in 2017 threatening to bomb one another . The current diplomatic gambit is , in part , to see if talks can solve the nuclear standoff instead of war . But if the talks fail , or either leader grows impatient with the process , both sides could return to threatening each other .\nIf Trump walks away from a summit or at least delays it , the chance of war increases slightly , Vipin Narang , a nuclear expert at MIT , told me .

After all, the reason they are talking is, in part, to avoid a horrific war.\n\nScenario one: small deal and more talks\n\nThis, experts tell me, is the most likely outcome of a Trump-Kim summit.\n\n\u201cWhat we should be expecting is ... a mutually agreed-upon outline for how the process moves forward, a sense of realistic timing, and some principles of what elements absolutely need to be included in an agreement from both sides,\u201d Jenny Town, a Koreas expert at the Stimson Center, told me. \u201cThen it gets handed down to negotiators to work out the details.\u201d\n\nIn practice, this is the start of the deal.

Sitting down with Trump makes North Korea look like a legitimate country. But establishing formal diplomatic ties with Washington, including sending a recognized ambassador to the US, would make it seem like a normal country in America\u2019s eyes.\n\nOf course, reaching that point would take significant time.\n\nTrump could also agree to remove some of the 28,500 US troops in South Korea, something he has repeatedly said he wanted to do. Pyongyang sees those troops as a possible invading force, but Seoul considers them a security guarantee against a possible North Korean attack. To satisfy Kim and make some sort of deal, Trump may choose to harm the US-South Korea alliance.\n\nScenario three: no agreement\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: This would probably be the worst overall outcome.\n\nTrump and Kim spent an inordinate amount of time in 2017 threatening to bomb one another.
