Asylum-seekers have also recently been implicated in terrorist plots in Europe .\nBut after sifting through databases , media reports , court documents , and other sources , Alex Nowrasteh , an immigration expert at the libertarian Cato Institute , has arrived at a striking finding : Nationals of the seven countries singled out by Trump have killed zero people in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil between 1975 and 2015 .\nSix Iranians , six Sudanese , two Somalis , two Iraqis , and one Yemeni have been convicted of attempting or executing terrorist attacks on U.S. soil during that time period , according to Nowrasteh \u2019 s research . ( Nowrasteh focused on plots against the U.S. homeland , which presumably Trump cares most about , rather than other terrorism-related offenses , like supporting a foreign terrorist group or trying to join a jihadist organization overseas . ) Zero Libyans and zero Syrians have been convicted of doing the same . \u201c Foreign-born terrorism is a hazard , \u201d Nowrasteh argues , \u201c but it is manageable given the huge economic benefits of immigration and the small costs of terrorism . \u201d\nAs for refugees , Nowrasteh writes , Trump \u2019 s action \u201c is a response to a phantom menace. \u201d Over the last four decades , 20 out of 3.25 million refugees welcomed to the United States have been convicted of attempting or committing terrorism on U.S. soil , and only three Americans have been killed in attacks committed by refugees\u2014all by Cuban refugees in the 1970s .\nZero Americans have been killed by Syrian refugees in a terrorist attack in the United States .\nBetween 1975 and 2015 , the \u201c annual chance of being murdered by somebody other than a foreign-born terrorist was 252.9 times greater than the chance of dying in a terrorist attack committed by a foreign-born terrorist , \u201d according to Nowrasteh .\nNowrasteh has listed foreign-born individuals who committed or were convicted of attempting to commit a terrorist attack on U.S. soil by their country of origin and the number of people they killed . As in any exercise like this , the statistics are rough and directional rather than precise . For example , the San Bernardino attacker Tashfeen Malik , who was born in Pakistan but lived in Saudi Arabia most of her life , is counted as originating from Saudi Arabia . In the case of attacks perpetrated by multiple terrorists , like 9/11 , each terrorist is assigned an equal number of victims .\nStill , it \u2019 s worth noting that the countries at the top of the list , including Saudi Arabia and Egypt , are not included in Trump \u2019 s ban . I \u2019 ve bolded the countries included in Trump \u2019 s executive order .\nThe 9/11 attacks were carried out by 19 men\u2014from Saudi Arabia ( 15 ) , the United Arab Emirates ( 2 ) , Egypt ( 1 ) , and Lebanon ( 1 ) . The incident remains influential in how Americans think about the nature of terrorism ; Trump \u2019 s executive order cites 9/11 as a prime example of the U.S. visa process catastrophically breaking down .
