    "content": "The other day , someone who was discussed in this space a couple times way back there in the primordial mists of 2013 suddenly resigned his job as Attorney General of New York . That would be one Eric Schneiderman , who was discussed here in a blog post from August , 2013 titled : \u201c New Obama Scandal Erupts : Trump Targeted. \u201d ( In which a meeting between then-President Obama and New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman \u2014 Trump haters both \u2014 was discussed . ) Then there was this one , a column titled \u201c Shakedown Schneiderman , \u201d and also another , \u201c The Malversation of Eric Schneiderman . \u201d\nIn all of which I had come to the thoroughgoing conclusion that Mr. Schneiderman \u2019 s conduct as Attorney General indicated he was , simply put , a fraud \u2014 and a dangerous fraud at that . This was no dedicated public servant of the liberal variety . This was someone who , as the words of a leftist columnist for the Village Voice described it , saw his job as being \u201c transactional. \u201d Which is to say \u2014 \u201c You do something for me , and I will use the powers of my job as Attorney General to do something for you . \u201d\nMr. Schneiderman had come to my attention as I was reading the public prints and learning that Schneiderman was suing a private citizen in New York named\u2026 Donald Trump . The lawsuit was over what was called in the day \u201c Trump University , \u201d a typical organization of motivational-style instructors who were experts in the real estate business . One paid to hear from the speakers and learn the how-to of real estate but then\u2026 horrors ! \u2014 one had actually to go out and do the work . As is to be expected with such a venture , some people succeeded , others failed . So the grousings from the latter group , which was small , were quickly focused on by Schneiderman and suddenly Donald Trump \u2019 s name was giving Schneiderman lots of PR as the figurative defender of the little guy .\nHaving been around the political block , to me , something was , as they say , \u201c rotten in Denmark. \u201d Or Albany as the ( frequent ) case seems to be . Of all the things going on in New York State \u2014 why zero in on someone as hugely successful as Donald Trump ? The idea that a billionaire ten times over was trying to defraud a handful of people out of a few thousand dollars made no sense . So , I began to look . In fact , Donald Trump took the time to speak with me directly on the issue . He was indignant . And what did I learn ?\nI learned that \u2014 yes , indeed \u2014 Schneiderman had been after Donald Trump for a campaign contribution . Receiving it , Schneiderman was not satisfied . Now the arm was being put on Trump family members \u2014 daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared specifically . Not satisfied there , Schneiderman was going to Trump Organization staff . And then\u2026 the hook .\nStill not satisfied with what he was getting from the family Trump , he began to take another approach once elected and actually becoming the sitting attorney general . I wrote this :\nLet \u2019 s begin specifically by thinking of Donald Trump \u2019 s multi-billion-dollar , resoundingly successful company \u2014 The Trump Organization \u2014 as Khartoum the race horse . Khartoum the race horse ? You remember Khartoum the race horse . The scene is immortalized in the Oscar-winning film The Godfather . The rich and famous Hollywood producer Jack Woltz , owner of the $ 600,000 Secretariat-like race horse Khartoum , refuses to put Mafia Don Vito Corleone \u2019 s favored godson Johnny Fontane in a movie . One fine morning , Woltz awakens , horrified , to find the severed head of his beloved race horse \u2014 whom he has lovingly described beforehand as \u201c the greatest racehorse in the world \u201d \u2014 in his blood-soaked bed . As seen here in the legendary scene from the film version of Mario Puzo \u2019 s bestselling novel . Message delivered , Don Corleone \u2019 s god son Johnny Fontane gets his movie part from the thoroughly terrified movie producer . Now . Think of Eric Schneiderman , the Attorney General of New York , supposed progressive \u201c icon of the left \u201d and a wannabe governor \u2014 as a dime store Godfather . Vicious , but Vito Corleone without the gravitas .\nThe core of Shakedown Schneiderman \u2019 s Don Corleone-style method of operation is captured by the famous line from the Don himself . As Puzo immortalized the line in The Godfather , the Don would get Johnny Fontane the desired movie part in unique fashion , saying of producer Woltz : \u201c He \u2019 s a businessman . I \u2019 ll make him an offer he can \u2019 t refuse. \u201d The offer , of course , was Khartoum \u2019 s severed head . The blunt message ? Next time it would be Woltz \u2019 s head . What was Schneiderman \u2019 s \u201c offer he can \u2019 t refuse \u201d to businessman Donald Trump ? In Schneiderman \u2019 s own words to Trump \u2019 s counsel , as documented in the Trump filing , Donald Trump would be forced to settle the lawsuit Schneiderman was threatening because Trump would not \u201c want all of the bad press. \u201d As in : Nice business ya got there Mr. Trump . Be a shame if anything happened to it .\nTo say the least , this kind of thing does not speak well of an Attorney General . I looked further into Schneiderman \u2019 s past to discover this :\nThe AG \u2019 s career also depends on Schneiderman keeping his coattails free of corruption charges , which thus far has been dicey . A federal sentencing memorandum on Schneiderman \u2019 s ex-State Senate colleague Shirley Huntley prompted Huntley \u2019 s attorney , according to the New York Daily News , to allege her client had information \u201c about corruption involving Eric Schneiderman. \u201d This doesn \u2019 t even count the murmurs from Schneiderman \u2019 s political base of New York \u2019 s hard left that he is , among other things , a \u201c water boy \u201d and \u201c transactional . \u201d\nA few weeks later I followed up with another column , \u201c The Malversation of Eric Schneiderman. \u201d In which I reported this :\nUh-oh . New York Attorney General Eric \u201c Shakedown \u201d Schneiderman has just been walloped with an ethics complaint . A long and meticulously detailed 228-page ethics complaint . Filed by\u2026 Donald Trump .\nSuffice to say , that ethics complaint was detailed to the max . It was chapter and verse what I suspected \u2014 that the transactional Mr. Schneiderman was unhappy he had not gotten the Trump campaign contributions he thought were his due . And so I ended the column this way :\nThe fix was in for Donald Trump . And according to the Constitution of New York State ? That is malversation \u2014 cause for removal from office . Your move , Governor Cuomo .\nWell , finally , Governor Cuomo moved . Five years late , but he finally did something . Cuomo acted after a major assist from the New Yorker and reporters Jane Mayer and Ronan Farrow , the latter the journalist who uncovered the massive Harvey Weinstein story . Their story is remarkable in the detailed portrait of an abuser of women who was frequently so drunk he couldn \u2019 t stand up . The ultimate of empty vessels . Amazing . Yet , it must be said , so terribly predictable to me and certainly to President Trump . In fact , the future president had tweeted this in 2013 : \u201c Weiner is gone , Spitzer is gone \u2014 next will be lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman . Is he a crook ? Wait and see , worse than Spitzer or Weiner \u201d\nAs it happens , as I well recall , this tweet came a matter of days after I had spoken with Mr. Trump about this very subject . He was clearly of the view that Schneiderman was a crook and especially angry at the Attorney General for the slimy game being played with Ivanka , Jared , and his staff . And as is so often the case , Donald Trump was unerringly right .\nHere we are five years later and there is this as written by Mayer and Farrow , writing about Michelle Manning Barish , one of the women who has come forward with her accusations . Bold print for emphasis is supplied :\nSince the # MeToo movement began , Manning Barish has been active on social-media platforms , cheering on women who have spoken out , including those whose accusations prompted the resignation of the Minnesota senator Al Franken , a widely admired Democrat . Once , she made an oblique reference to Schneiderman on social media , in connection with a political issue . He called her and , in a tone that she describes as \u201c nasty , \u201d said , \u201c Don \u2019 t ever write about me . You don \u2019 t want to do that. \u201d Manning Barish says that she took his remarks as a threat , just as she took seriously a comment that he \u2019 d once made after she objected to him \u201c yanking \u201d her across a street . She recalls saying to him , \u201c Jaywalking is against the law , \u201d and him responding , \u201c I am the law. \u201d Manning Barish says , \u201c If there is a sentence that sums him up , it \u2019 s that . \u201d\nIn other words ? In other words this was the pattern of Schneiderman \u2019 s transactional approach to his job as Attorney General . He was the law , and he would use the law to get what he wanted . What did he want from Donald Trump ? Money \u2014 and if not enough money he would use Trump and the Trump family to get publicity by going after Trump with the powers of the New York Attorney General . What did he want with Ms. Manning Barish and the other women ? Sex . And if they stood up to him \u2014 as did Donald Trump \u2014 they would be reminded by Schneiderman : \u201c I am the law . \u201d\nThis was a person seriously unfit for public office of any kind . He abused his office and the public trust just as he abused women .\nThe real question here ? As with Harvey Weinstein , it simply isn \u2019 t possible that Schneiderman was conducting himself in this fashion and people did not know . In the Schneiderman case , Albany was Hollywood . The idea that Governor Cuomo , the leaders of the State Legislature , New York City Mayor de Blasio and others ( where was the New York media ? ? ? ) were clueless about Schneiderman \u2019 s problems doesn \u2019 t even come close to passing the smell test . Cuomo is frequently mentioned as a possible candidate for president . If that comes to pass , the Schneiderman episode is surely going to cause him a problem of the \u201c what did you know and when did you know it \u201d variety .\nIs this a tragedy for Eric Schneiderman the human being , and his family ? Of course . He will spend one very long time dealing with this \u2014 possibly the rest of his life \u2014 with no small irony being that he will find out that no , actually , he is not the law .\nIn the world of cosmic justice ?
