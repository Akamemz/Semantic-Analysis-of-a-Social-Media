But every day that I wait , we \u2019 re misallocating resources , we \u2019 re deporting people that shouldn \u2019 t be deported , we \u2019 re not deporting folks that are dangerous and need to be deported , \u201d Mr. Obama said in an interview aired Sunday on the CBS program \u201c Face the Nation . \u201d\nMr. Obama has been warned against acting unilaterally on immigration by House Speaker John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican , and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , who is likely to become majority leader when Republicans take over the upper chamber in January .\nSen. John Barrasso , Wyoming Republican , said the president \u2019 s executive action on immigration would be like tossing a \u201c hand grenade \u201d into his negotiations with the Republican-run Congress .\n\u201c It would be like the president pulling the pin out of a hand grenade and throwing it in as we are trying to actually work together . I am hoping that cooler heads at the White House can prevail , \u201d he said on \u201c Fox News Sunday . \u201d\nThe fight over immigration reform adds to the drama when Congress resumes this week after a wave of Republican victories over Democrats in midterm elections . Lawmakers will wrestle with the budget , tax measures and whether to take up Mr. Obama \u2019 s nomination of New York federal prosecutor Loretta Lynch to be the next attorney general .\nMr. Obama said he took responsibility for Democrats \u2019 widespread losses in the elections , which Republicans succeeded in making a referendum on the president \u2019 s job performance .\n\u201c We got beat , \u201d said Mr. Obama . \u201c The buck stops right here , at my desk . And so whenever , as the head of the party , it doesn \u2019 t do well , I \u2019 ve got to take responsibility for it . \u201d\nDespite a slow but steady economic recovery , Mr. Obama said , many Americans are still struggling and are angry about partisan paralysis in Washington .\n\u201c We \u2019 re making progress , but people still feel like their wages haven \u2019 t gone up , their incomes haven \u2019 t gone up , it \u2019 s still hard to save for retirement , still hard to send a kid to college .

We can always knock out \u2014 knock back any threat . But then when we leave , that threat comes back , \u201d Mr. Obama said .\nCritics blame the president \u2019 s 2011 withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq for creating a power vacuum that has been filled by Sunni extremists .\nAs he risked a brawl with Republican leaders over immigration , the president said that offering legal status and a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants was the only option because \u201c we don \u2019 t have the capacity to deport 11 million people . \u201d\nMr. Obama insisted that his executive order did not have to be the last word on immigration reform .
