Democrats started promising to do this before the president was elected . Still , it feels kind of weird , surprising , surreal even , that it actually happened . Why ? Because impeachment is a terrible idea for the country . At this point , there is no chance the Democrats can remove the president . And in trying , they will only hurt themselves . The polls are clear . Yet -- and here is the fascinating part -- they did it anyway .\nMaryland Congressman Jamie Raskin explained why : `` The president 's continuing course of conduct constitutes a clear and present danger to democracy in America . We can not allow this misconduct to pass . It would be a sell-out of our Constitution , our foreign policy , our national security , and our democracy . '' See if you can follow his logic chain : Leaving a president in office until voters can decide to remove him from office if they want to is `` a danger to democracy . ''\nThe entire impeachment saga has become detached from reality . Here are the facts : Democrats do not have the votes to remove Trump from office . They never will have the votes to remove the president . The point of impeachment is to remove a president . They can not do that . This process is doomed . By the way , they do n't have the votes because voters do n't support it . The irony is that our democracy is working just fine . Voters support it . After a full month of watching public hearings on impeachment , Democrats have not gained support . They have lost it . In late October , when this began , about half the country backed impeachment and 44 % said they were opposed . In the most recent polling , those numbers have inverted . In other words , the more people learned about impeachment , the less they wanted impeachment . That 's not one person 's opinion . That is the sum total of the polling .\nEven in the face of all the data , elite Democrats still will not admit it . They are in denial . Democratic Party cheerleader and CNN commentator Jeffrey Toobin attacked his own company 's polling when it did n't match what he believes to be true : `` You see a decline from our last poll in Democratic support from 90 % down to 77 % . Can I just say , that I do n't believe that poll for one second ... The 90 % to 77 % . You know , it 's just I do n't believe it .
