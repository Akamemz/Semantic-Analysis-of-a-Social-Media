    "content": "The debate about confirming Loretta Lynch is suddenly getting partisan .\nDemocrats are now increasingly slamming Republicans \u2019 handling of President Barack Obama \u2019 s nominee for attorney general , accusing them of slow-walking the veteran federal prosecutor \u2019 s confirmation . Their newest evidence : the Senate Judiciary Committee \u2019 s decision Thursday to postpone voting on Lynch until after next week \u2019 s recess \u2014 which means she won \u2019 t get a final floor vote until March , at least five weeks after her confirmation hearing .\nThe confirmation pace stands in especially stark contrast to how quickly the GOP-led Senate has taken up Ash Carter \u2019 s nomination for defense secretary . He first appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee Feb. 4 , was swiftly reported out of that panel earlier this week and is headed to a Thursday confirmation vote .\n\u201c There \u2019 s so many similarities between the Lynch nomination and the Carter nomination , \u201d said Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) , one of Lynch \u2019 s biggest boosters . \u201c And to move Carter so quickly and to slow down Lynch is very troublesome , and I think they ought to move her ASAP . \u201d\nOne reason for the lag on Lynch is that after Obama nominated her in November , Senate Democrats agreed to postpone her confirmation into the new Republican-led chamber at the GOP \u2019 s request . Democrats meant it as a gesture of goodwill , and they also believed Lynch would be confirmed in either a Democratic- or GOP-controlled Senate .\nBut now the Democratic anger is beginning to flare up .\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid ( D-Nev. ) noted that Lynch has waited longer for a vote than any attorney general nominee in three decades . He urged Republicans to confirm Lynch , currently the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York , before next week \u2019 s congressional recess \u2014 a request that will go unheeded .\nAnd Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy , who chaired Judiciary when Democrats were in power , said that despite his personal objections to former Attorney General Michael Mukasey under the George W. Bush administration , he moved the process along in just under eight weeks .\nRepublicans have said generally they have no beef with Lynch \u2019 s qualifications and r\u00e9sum\u00e9 . But Republicans are using her nomination as one way to fight Obama over his executive actions on immigration , and they have also repeatedly pressed Lynch over issues involving current Attorney General Eric Holder \u2014 who has had a deeply contentious relationship with GOP lawmakers .\nIn an interview Wednesday , Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley ( R-Iowa ) , a frequent Holder critic , said he was still undecided on whether he would support Lynch but sent a strong signal that he was not pleased with the federal prosecutor \u2019 s responses so far .\n\u201c She needs to show me and a lot of other members that she \u2019 s going to be a different attorney general than Holder , \u201d Grassley said in an interview . \u201c I haven \u2019 t come to that conclusion that she has , and that \u2019 s what I \u2019 m looking for . \u201d\nGrassley , who sent Lynch a list of 81 questions \u2014 many of them multipart \u2014 said he plans to send some follow-up queries to her .

Within Judiciary , Republican Sens . Orrin Hatch of Utah and Jeff Flake of Arizona have said they will support her . On Wednesday , Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-S.C. ) reiterated that he was inclined to back Lynch .\n\u201c I think she \u2019 s a good nominee , \u201d Graham said . When asked if the committee vote on Lynch will be held over until later this month , he responded : \u201c I don \u2019 t know . I \u2019 m ready to vote . \u201d\nUnder the committee \u2019 s rules , any senator can ask for business , such as consideration of a nominee , to be held over for one week \u2014 a practice that doesn \u2019 t have to be deployed but has become routine .
