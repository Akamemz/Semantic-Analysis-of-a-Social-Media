    "content": "Speaking before dawn at Conservative Party headquarters on Friday morning , Boris Johnson celebrated \u201c a huge , great stonking mandate \u201d from the British people , after his party won an overwhelming victory in Thursday \u2019 s election . The Conservatives now have three hundred and sixty-four members of Parliament\u2014a majority of almost eighty over the the other parties\u2014and enormous freedom to govern for the next five years . The vote is a turning point . It is the best result for the Tories since 1987 , and the first time since the days of Margaret Thatcher that the Party has decisively won the argument about the future of the country . The argument , of course , was about Brexit , at least for Johnson . \u201c Get Brexit Done \u201d was his slogan and sole focus . For Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party , whose election manifesto was anything but myopic\u2014an eye-catching grab-bag of progressive ideas to address inequality and climate change , arranged around a complicated Brexit policy\u2014this was a disaster . The party held on to just two hundred and three seats in the House of Commons , its worst result since the Depression , and more or less in line with the defeat of Michael Foot , its most recent radical left-wing leader , in 1983 . Foot \u2019 s election manifesto was memorably described as \u201c the longest suicide note in history. \u201d This morning , Corbyn said that he would not lead Labour into its next election , but hinted that he would stick around for \u201c a period of reflection \u201d while the Party figures out what to do . Johnson was more succinct . \u201c We have defeated Corbyn , \u201d he said .\nIt was a terrible night for the United Kingdom . Johnson and the Conservatives can look forward to great power in London in the coming years , but Scotland , Northern Ireland , England , and Wales increasingly look like nations coming apart . The Scottish National Party , which opposes Brexit and wants independence , won forty-eight out of fifty-nine seats in Scotland . The Party \u2019 s leader , Nicola Sturgeon , said that she would write to Johnson before Christmas to request another referendum to break the union with England , which has lasted for three hundred and twelve years . \u201c I have a mandate to give Scotland a choice for an alternative future , \u201d she said . One nationalism breeds another . In Northern Ireland , which under Johnson \u2019 s Brexit deal will be separated from mainland Britain by a regime of customs checks , the Conservatives \u2019 former allies , the Democratic Unionist Party , lost two of its ten seats . The D.U.P. \u2019 s veteran leader in Parliament , Nigel Dodds , lost his seat , in North Belfast , to John Finucane , a Sinn Fein candidate whose father was murdered by pro-union terrorists during the Troubles . \u201c North Belfast rejects Brexit , \u201d Finucane said . \u201c North Belfast is a Remain constituency and wants a future as part of the European Union. \u201d Johnson must now hold a creaking entity together . This morning , he described the Conservatives as \u201c a great one-nation party , \u201d meaning that they represent the whole of the U.K . But there is only one nation where Brexit and Johnson \u2019 s populism have truly flourished , and that is England . There the map is Conservative blue .\nThe questions for Labour are existential . Under Tony Blair , the Party merged its historic base in Scotland and the industrial north of England with metropolitan liberals and floating commuter voters in the south . Two elections ago , in 2015 , the S.N.P . virtually banished Labour from Scotland , stripping the Party of around forty M.P.s . Last night , Labour lost another fifty-nine seats , this time in former mining and manufacturing communities across the north , where it had dominated the vote since the First World War . In Blyth Valley , a constituency north of Newcastle , the Conservatives won for the first time since 1950 , when the electoral district was created . In Blair \u2019 s old parliamentary seat of Sedgefield , the Labour vote collapsed by seventeen per cent . The new M.P. , Paul Howell , is the first Conservative to represent the town since 1931 . Many of the seats that Labour lost were in parts of the country that voted to leave the European Union three years ago . This morning , Johnson acknowledged that , in places like Burnley , Bassetlaw , and Bishop Auckland , which has voted for Liberal and Labour M.P.s since 1885 , people had turned to the Conservatives to deliver Brexit . The Prime Minister described leaving the E.U . as now the \u201c irrefutable , irresistible , unarguable decision of the British people. \u201d He said that he would work flat-out to enact it . \u201c You may intend to return to Labour next time round , \u201d Johnson said . \u201c If that is the case , I am humbled that you have put your trust in me , and I will never take your support for granted . \u201d\nBut Brexit alone does not explain Labour \u2019 s weak performance . Since 2016 , the Party has stretched and strained to accommodate its traditional supporters , many of whom voted for Brexit . Corbyn himself is no fan of the E.U . The trouble is that Labour \u2019 s demographic coalition\u2014the British equivalent of the group that the Democratic Party must hold together in 2020\u2014is losing its glue . Corbyn \u2019 s metropolitan socialism , his big-ticket nationalizations and green industrial strategy , did not cut it in communities that had voted Labour for generations . They were ideas that came from somewhere else . In Bolsover , Derbyshire , Dennis Skinner , Labour \u2019 s eighty-seven-year-old M.P. , had held office since before his Conservative opponent was born . Like seventy per cent of his constituents , Skinner supported Brexit . But he lost by more than five thousand votes . Mark Fletcher , who won the seat for the Tories , told the Financial Times that Corbyn \u2019 s unpopularity had been decisive . \u201c Anti-Corbyn sentiment was the biggest thing I picked up on the doorstep , \u201d Fletcher said . \u201c Brexit would be number two . Number three would be the sense of not being listened to , taken for granted . \u201d\nWhat does Johnson \u2019 s victory mean ? In short order , it means that the debate over Brexit , which has traumatized British politics for the past three and a half years , is over . With a compliant House of Commons , Johnson will take the country out of the E.U . on January 31st . He will also have considerable leeway in the trade negotiations that follow . Johnson has promised to settle a new free-trade deal with the E.U . by the end of 2020 . Most experts and diplomats agree that this is impossible , but Johnson will have a rancorous British Parliament cheering him on . No one on the right will stand up to him . Everyone else will hope that a softer , less divisive Johnson will emerge , now that he has been elected Prime Minister by the population as a whole . This morning , there has already been speculation that Johnson will use his margin of victory to pivot to the center\u2014negotiating a close partnership with the E.U . and governing as a moderate\u2014but this is based on nothing at all . Rejoicing at Conservative Party headquarters , Johnson sounded almost dazed by what had happened . \u201c We must now understand the earthquake we have created , the way in which we have changed the political map of this country , \u201d he said . \u201c We must grapple with the consequences of that. \u201d President Trump tweeted his congratulations , teasing the offer of \u201c a massive new Trade Deal after BREXIT \u201d to the U.K. Those entreaties will be hard to resist , as will the political instincts that have carried Johnson this far . During the campaign , he made strikingly few promises\u2014there was Brexit , some more police , a few new hospitals\u2014and nothing much else .
