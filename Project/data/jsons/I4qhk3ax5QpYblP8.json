    "content": "In a six-to-three decision , the Supreme Court announced on Thursday that it was upholding a key component of the Affordable Care Act , preserving federal health insurance subsidies for millions of Americans . Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kennedy dressed to the left this time and shifted the balance in support of the law , along with justices Kagan , Sotomayor , Ginsberg and Breyer . Predictably , justices Alito , Scalia and Thomas sided with the plaintiffs .\nRegarding the dissenting justices : Um , what the hell ? Are n't hard-line paleo-conservatives supposed to be against frivolous lawsuits ? Of course they are . And of course the King v Burwell case was absolutely a frivolous lawsuit . The entire law could have potentially collapsed over a lawsuit that disputed the existence of seven words in an otherwise massive piece of legislation . Those seven words : `` through an exchange established by the state . '' That was the basis of the whole thing . The plaintiffs argued that based on those words , the federal government could only provide subsidies for lower income Americans who purchased insurance through a state-run exchange .\nIn other words , the lawsuit claimed that Obamacare insurance customers in all states that use the national Healthcare.gov marketplace should n't get subsidies to help cover premium costs . What 's perfectly clear in the language , however , is that the governments of each state decides which exchange its citizens will have to use : either a state-run marketplace or the federal exchange . Case in point : Hawaii was the first state to form a state-based exchange : the Hawaii Health Connector . But just the other day , Democratic governor David Ige announced that the Health Connectors was financially unfeasible and opted to shut it down , transferring all customers to the Healthcare.gov . This is purely a state decision and therefore the subsidies ought to still apply .\nIn Roberts ' majority opinion , the chief justice wrote that in the context of the law as a whole ( many more than seven words in length ) , the claim against the word usage was `` untenable . '' Of course . To any sentient , thinking human , untenable is right .\nSo , back to Scalia , Alito and Thomas . The fact that three Supreme Court justices sided with the plaintiff on Burwell proves how ideological and dumb those three justices truly are . To anyone with a basic grasp on reality , the language in the law is clear and incontrovertible . But in the far-right bubble , grasping desperately for anything that could undermine the law is de rigueur for the GOP , including nearly 60 votes so far to destroy the law in spite of the fact that President Obama would never in a million years sign such legislation . The flailing has become so pathetic that three justices in the highest court in the land sided in support of an hilariously frivolous lawsuit .\nI 'm old enough to remember a time when the Republican Party actively campaigned in support of tort reform , especially in the healthcare field . Indeed , tort reform is still a plank in the GOP platform . But lately , the congressional Republicans have gone all gushy for frivolous lawsuits , going so far as to sue Obama on numerous occasions . Rather than doing its job and actually , you know , legislating , Republicans from Speaker Boehner on down the line have opted instead for silly lawsuits aimed at various actions by the White House .\nFor example , before the Defense of Marriage Act was repealed , Boehner tried to sue Obama and his Justice Department for not enforcing the law . Elsewhere , tea party senator Ron Johnson tried to sue Obama over Congress ' alleged `` exemption from Obamacare . ''\nThe latter suit was egregiously and offensively frivolous since Congress is n't exempt from Obamacare at all . In fact , the law requires members of Congress and staffers who want employee-based coverage to get it through Healthcare.gov . Obama merely authorized a rule that was requested by , yes , Speaker Boehner to continue allowing the government to share the premium costs . So , Johnson was basically suing over a semantic trick -- the patently false claim that Congress was exempt from Obamacare was intended to infuriate the base and make it seem as if Congress carved out a special loophole for itself , which Obama subsequently signed .
