Young testified that he allowed Hunter to move in with him and his wife at Edwards ' request after newspapers began looking into a possible affair within the Edwards campaign .\nYoung initially claimed to be the father of Hunter 's baby girl and testified that Mellon was already funding Hunter 's living expenses when he called Baron to complain about the situation . Baron offered to help out , telling Young to write up Hunter 's expenses so Baron could reimburse them , the aide testified .\nNeither Baron nor Mellon appeared to know that the other was reimbursing Young for the same expenses , raising questions about whether and how much Young may have profited from the situation . Young acknowledged during the trial that he had used some donations for his own personal benefit , including paying for the construction of a home .\nAnother former Edwards aide , speechwriter Wendy Button , testified that Edwards knew Baron was supporting Hunter and her child in 2009 . Defense lawyer Abbe Lowell urged jurors to focus on Young 's role in the case , saying he was a biased and unreliable witness with a financial and legal interest in the outcome .\n`` There is nothing he wo n't lie about , nothing , '' Lowell said .\nYoung , the author of a tell-all book about the Edwards scandal , testified under an agreement with the government in hopes that he will not be prosecuted .
