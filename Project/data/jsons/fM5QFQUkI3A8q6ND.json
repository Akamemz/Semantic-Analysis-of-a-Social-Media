    "content": "The Trump administration wants to send a message to unauthorized immigrants living in self-identified \u201c sanctuary cities \u201d : your local government can \u2019 t actually keep you from getting deported .\nIn September , Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) conducted a weeklong operation in which it arrested nearly 500 immigrants . Most of them deliberately sought out by ICE for having prior criminal convictions ; some , as has happened in the other high-profile raids whose frequency has increased under Trump , just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time . But all of them lived in \u201c sanctuary cities . \u201d\nSome ICE officials have acknowledged ( anonymously ) for months that the Trump administration is deliberately targeting unauthorized immigrants who live in cities that are trying to protect them from the Trump administration .\nBecause , under Trump , reminding immigrants that they might be deported \u2014 and should be worried about deportation \u2014 is both a matter of principle and an important policy weapon . It \u2019 s the cornerstone of this administration \u2019 s immigration enforcement policy \u2014 and its foremost policy accomplishment .\n\u201c If you \u2019 re in this country illegally , and you committed a crime by entering this country , you should be uncomfortable , \u201d acting ICE Director Tom Homan told Congress in May . \u201c You should look over your shoulder . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s a variation on the \u201c self-deportation \u201d theory immigration hawks have been putting forth for years \u2014 the idea that if you put enough pressure on unauthorized immigrants , from enough different directions , you can make them so miserable that leaving the US after years of living here looks like an appealing option . But instead of pressuring immigrants from multiple directions , Trump is hammering down , again and again , to activate their single biggest fear : that the system will catch them , arrest them , and throw them into a pitiless and grinding deportation machine .\nTrump \u2019 s policy is marked by a little more enforcement \u2014 and a lot more vulnerability\nIt only took five days for the administration to make its agenda clear to unauthorized immigrants in the United States .\nOn January 25 , Trump signed an executive order addressing immigration enforcement in the interior of the United States . Among other things , the order officially rescinded a series of Obama administration memos that laid out which immigrants should be considered priorities for deportation \u2014 and which should not .\nUnder the new policy , the following types of immigrants are among those prioritized for deportation : immigrants who \u201c have committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense \u201d ( which includes driving without a license in states that don \u2019 t give licenses to unauthorized immigrants ) ; immigrants who engage in \u201c fraud or willful representation in any official matter \u201d ( which could include paying taxes under a fake Social Security number ) ; and immigrants who , despite not having committed any act that constitutes a \u201c chargeable criminal offense , \u201d are still a \u201c risk to public safety or national security \u201d in the eyes of the ICE agent arresting them .\nUnder the new policy , the following types of deportable immigrants are low priorities for deportation : none .\nWhen President Trump , then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly , and other Trump officials bragged about \u201c unshackling \u201d immigration agents , this is what they meant . Agents had more power to decide which immigrants to arrest and put into deportation proceedings , because the pool of immigrants most vulnerable to deportation had expanded by millions .\nThe number of immigrants actually getting arrested and put into deportation proceedings did not , of course , expand by millions .\nOn the ground , the Trump administration expanded enforcement mostly by going after \u201c low-hanging fruit \u201d \u2014 immigrants whose locations were already known . Sometimes that means going after \u201c criminals \u201d ( in its first few months , the administration took a much more aggressive approach than its predecessor did in asking jail officials to hold immigrants for ICE pickup ) , but it sometimes means going after people who are coming to ICE offices for check-ins , or even going to US Citizenship and Immigration Services to interview for their green cards .\nBut the administration has done just enough to keep any immigrant who isn \u2019 t already on ICE \u2019 s radar from feeling really safe . It \u2019 s conducted a few high-profile , coordinated immigration raids \u2014 in which it \u2019 s arrested both the people it was seeking out and anyone else who happened to be around and deportable . One ICE source said in March that the government was deliberately planning raids in \u201c sanctuary cities \u201d \u2014 an effective way to remind immigrant communities that even if their local government was trying to lower their risk of deportation , it couldn \u2019 t actually protect immigrants from the feds .\nTrump \u2019 s ICE is arresting more immigrants than it did under Obama \u2019 s last couple of years in office . From October to December 2016 , ICE arrested an average of 9,134 immigrants a month ; from February to June 2017 , it arrested an average of 13,085 . That \u2019 s simultaneously a big increase \u2014 a 43 percent jump \u2014 and a drop in the bucket , compared with the expansion in the pool of immigrants made vulnerable to deportation .\nUnder the last two years of the Obama administration , the government \u2019 s official position was that immigrants would be prioritized for deportation if they were convicted of certain serious crimes , or if they were recent border crossers or had recent final deportation orders . There were 750,000 \u201c convicted criminal aliens \u201d ; it \u2019 s unclear how many people fell in the other two categories , but the total number of people prioritized as of January 19 , 2017 , was almost certainly less than 2 million \u2014 possibly much lower .\nOn January 25 , 2017 , the pool of immigrants \u201c prioritized \u201d \u2014 or at least not unprioritized \u2014 for deportation swelled to something like 10 million .\nThe Trump administration \u2019 s eyes were much bigger than its capacity .\nThe administration is operating on a budget and with a workforce set under its predecessor \u2014 which devoted much more effort to deporting immigrants from within the US than the government ever had before , but was still equipped for no more than 400,000 deportations per year . And due to the staggering immigration court backlog , those deportations are often of immigrants who were arrested years prior .\nA government capable of deporting all 11.1 million unauthorized immigrants over two presidential terms would need four times the deportation capacity it currently has . Even modestly increasing deportation capacity would require an investment , in the Department of Justice ( which runs immigration courts ) as well as the Department of Homeland Security , that \u2019 s likely to sit uneasily with congressional Republicans who aren \u2019 t even enthusiastic about paying $ 1.5 billion for a few dozen miles of border \u201c wall . \u201d\nActually carrying out mass arrests and deportations of long-resident , law-abiding unauthorized immigrants \u2014 \u201c good \u201d immigrants \u2014 could generate a serious outcry ( fueled by photos of families being separated by ICE agents ) . Many Republicans are already concerned about the politics of Trump \u2019 s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program , which currently protects over 700,000 young unauthorized immigrants from deportation and allows them to work in the US legally ; the politics of deporting them , along with their parents , would be even worse .\nThis isn \u2019 t a new problem . It \u2019 s why intellectual immigration hawks have long preferred \u201c self-deportation \u201d ( also known as \u201c attrition through enforcement \u201d ) over mass deportation . It might not be as brutally effective \u2014 even the most optimistic accounting suggests that 5 million immigrants could eventually be pushed to \u201c self-deport \u201d over the course of several years \u2014 but it \u2019 s much cheaper .\nWhat Trump is doing isn \u2019 t quite \u201c self-deportation \u201d either , though . The point of \u201c self-deportation \u201d is that the government is using all the tools at its disposal to make it hard to support a life and a family in the US without papers \u2014 and the centerpiece of that is making it impossible to get a job under the table , by mandating all businesses use the E-Verify system and cracking down on employers who hire unauthorized workers .\nThe Trump administration isn \u2019 t doing that . Its legislative agenda on immigration is focused on \u201c the wall \u201d and on cutting legal immigration rather than E-Verify ; it hasn \u2019 t stepped up workplace immigration enforcement much ( drawing ire from Laura Ingraham \u2019 s website , which called workplace enforcement the \u201c soft spot \u201d of Trump \u2019 s policy ) .\nInstead of using a variety of tools , it \u2019 s using a combination of policy and messaging to keep the threat of deportation hanging over immigrants \u2019 heads . It \u2019 s not trying to get them to go home because they can \u2019 t stay here ; it \u2019 s making sure they don \u2019 t get too comfortable here because they could be taken at any minute .\nIt \u2019 s a general law enforcement principle . Here \u2019 s how US Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley put it : When they have enough agents on a shift to catch all of the people or drugs they expect to enter the US during that time , they use their resources to catch those people and drugs . It \u2019 s only when they show up and realize they \u2019 re way undermatched ( something they emphasize hasn \u2019 t happened in several years ) that they bring out the floodlights and do circuits through the streets with sirens blaring \u2014 the \u201c high-visibility \u201d tactics .\nICE , the Border Patrol \u2019 s sister immigration force , appears to be doing something similar \u2014 not to deter immigrants from coming , but to remind those already here that their existence in the US is not a secure one .\nFear is hard to attack because it \u2019 s hard to see . It doesn \u2019 t spark political protests . It may not even be noticed by Americans who don \u2019 t know any immigrants . It \u2019 s easy to deflect onto others for causing fear \u2014 blaming immigrant organizations , for example , for spreading rumors of ICE raids . It leaves few fingerprints . And it takes little cash .\nThe January executive order let exactly one Obama-era protection stand \u2014 the DACA program \u2014 despite Trump \u2019 s promises to end Obama \u2019 s \u201c unconstitutional executive orders \u201d on \u201c day one \u201d on the campaign trail .\nFor months , the administration publicly weighed DACA \u2019 s fate ( even as , behind the scenes , ICE got more active in stripping protections from DACA recipients , sometimes based on disputed claims of gang affiliation ) . Every time Trump or his government declared that the program was still in effect , a DHS spokesperson hastened to clarify that they meant \u201c for now . \u201d\nTrump has already mischaracterized his DACA decision as one to keep the program for the next six months while it waits for Congress to act , and then start allowing protections and work permits issued under the program ( which last for two years ) to expire . ( Democrats have announced they \u2019 ve reached the broad outlines of a deal on DACA , but the exact details have yet to be worked out . )\nThe reality is that the program is winding down now . Immigrants who would have qualified for the program had they turned 15 in August , but instead turn 15 in October , will be locked out ; immigrants whose DACA protections are set to expire on March 4 have only until October 5 to collect their paperwork ( and $ 495 ) and apply for one last renewal .\nFor immigrants whose DACA protections are set to last through the next six months \u2014 who , in theory , aren \u2019 t supposed to be worried \u2014 there \u2019 s a world of difference between knowing when their work permits will expire and being able to quiet their minds until then . The expiration date isn \u2019 t a start date ; it \u2019 s an end date . President Trump says the DREAMers should be turning their hopes to Congress , but his White House \u2019 s talking points urge them to start making plans to leave the country when their work permits expire .\nAnd in the meantime , the Trump administration is already tightening the reins on DACA recipients . Border Patrol has started to detain DACA recipients at internal checkpoints , \u201c for accuracy and verification of status , \u201d sometimes holding them for several hours .\nThe Trump administration knows that telling people they have six months before being returned to the pool of vulnerability is a warning rather than a reprieve . It \u2019 s used that strategy deliberately with Haitians living in the US under Temporary Protected Status , issued after the 2010 earthquake \u2014 who are currently months into a six-month extension of protections that the government has all but promised will be their last .\nTemporary Protected Status is issued to people who are living in the US from a particular country , who don \u2019 t have a legal status that allows them to stay ( either because they \u2019 re here on short-term visas or because they \u2019 re unauthorized ) but , due to a natural disaster or other crisis in their home countries , can \u2019 t safely return either . The longer that people are protected in the US , however , the more they put down roots here , and the less sensible it appears to revoke their protections \u2014 especially because the alternative is returning to a country that may still be on the long road to recovery from crisis . So previous governments have tended to extend TPS protections when a country comes up for review .\nDHS under Kelly , however , wanted to put the \u201c temporary \u201d back in \u201c Temporary Protected Status. \u201d When TPS for Haitians came up for review in spring , Kelly granted a six-month extension but warned , \u201c I believe there are indications that Haiti \u2014 if its recovery from the 2010 earthquake continues at pace \u2014 may not warrant further TPS extension past January 2018 . \u201d\nKelly openly acknowledged he was sending a message to Haitians \u2014 and other TPS beneficiaries . \u201c The message is : By definition , TPS is temporary , '' he said in a press conference in Miami in June .\nAnd by sending that message , he wanted to get recipients to \u201c start thinking now about what will happen in the not-too-distant future. \u201d The memo extending TPS through January made that a little clearer . \u201c The Department of Homeland Security urges Haitian TPS recipients who do not have another immigration status to use the time before Jan. 22 , 2018 to prepare for and arrange their departure from the United States \u2014 including proactively seeking travel documentation \u2014 or to apply for other immigration benefits for which they may be eligible . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s the same language the White House talking points would use , months later , for DACA recipients .\nSome Haitians have already \u201c prepared for and arranged \u201d their travel \u2014 to Canada , where they \u2019 re seeking asylum . But others , clinging to the fact that the Trump administration hasn \u2019 t officially declared that TPS will end , are resistant to make plans to leave the country that many of them have lived in for most of their lives . \u201c I have nothing to go back to , \u201d Uber driver and would-be college student Jean Jubens Jeanty told the New York Times in July . \u201c Why not keep me here ? \u201d\nThis isn \u2019 t optimism . It \u2019 s simply not having alternatives . \u201c It \u2019 s very unsettling , \u201d a Queens College senior told the Times , \u201c to know that you \u2019 re here and you don \u2019 t know what tomorrow is going to bring , or what is going to happen in the next couple of months . \u201d\nLosing TPS wouldn \u2019 t create certainty \u2014 it would just open up a deeper anxiety , in which fear of being deportable is replaced with fear of actually getting deported .\nThe government \u2019 s official line that Haitians should prepare to leave the US isn \u2019 t a promise to deport them if they don \u2019 t , or at least not a promise the government can keep . There are 58,000 Haitian TPS recipients ; the government will have to make a decision by January about whether to keep protecting 86,000 Hondurans with TPS , and a decision by March about the fate of 263,000 Salvadorians .\nThose are numbers too big to round up and arrest with the resources the government has now , or can get in the next six months . But dumping them into the pool of vulnerability , and making it clear that they could get arrested at any time with no legal recourse ? It costs much less to send a message .\nThe fact that anyone living in the US without papers could be caught by ICE at any time is only part of the politics of fear . The other part is making it seem that anyone caught by ICE is inevitably going to get deported , and there \u2019 s nothing they or their lawyers can do to stop it .\nThe biggest practical obstacle to mass deportation is the immigration court backlog \u2014 in practice , it takes years to deport someone who hasn \u2019 t already been ordered deported . The Trump administration hasn \u2019 t yet put much effort into moving people through immigration court faster . Instead , it \u2019 s tried to portray the deportation process as a one-way journey \u2014 slow , but inevitable .\n\u201c Trump doesn \u2019 t deport people , \u201d John Kelly used to say as head of DHS . \u201c The law deports people . \u201d\nKelly has left the department for the White House , but that sentiment remains ; on a press briefing about the process of DACA rescission , one DHS official praised Trump as \u201c the first president who \u2019 s asked us to enforce the law as written , and not some executive interpretation of the law. \u201d ( That official , somewhat ironically , went on to assure reporters that even after losing DACA protections , DREAMers would remain \u201c low enforcement priorities \u201d \u2014 something that is neither in the text of \u201c the law \u201d nor in the text of any of the Trump administration \u2019 s guidance on the matter . )\nUnder Obama , immigrants and their lawyers could often persuade ICE that they weren \u2019 t high enough enforcement priorities to merit spending resources on an immigration court prosecution ; the immigration court case would be \u201c administratively closed , \u201d and the immigrant would be given a stay of deportation .\nFrom February to June 2016 , the Obama administration administratively closed an average of 2,400 cases a month . From February to June 2017 , the Trump administration closed an average of fewer than 100 .\nAn immigration lawyer told Vice that the key to closing immigration cases used to be \u201c shaming the government \u201d \u2014 but \u201c now , the government is shameless . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s certainly worked to appear shameless . Immigrants whose arrests provoked widespread media alarm and protests , like Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos ( arrested in February after 22 years in the US ) , might have been spared by the Obama administration \u2019 s desire to avoid bad press . The Trump administration deported Rayos in the middle of the night .\nBut it \u2019 s not actually true that the government is never showing discretion or leniency . There are cases where it has , in fact , been successfully shamed .\nJeannette Vizguerra spent most of the spring in the basement of a church in Denver ; she heard about people like Rayos getting arrested when they went in for ICE check-ins , and decided not to risk it . Because she missed her check-in , she was ordered deported in absentia \u2014 meaning she could be deported without going through immigration court . But she stayed in the church for months , and ICE agents didn \u2019 t dare go in and get her .\nAnd then in May , ICE granted Vizguerra ( and another Denver-area immigrant who \u2019 d taken church refuge ) a stay of deportation . She was able to return home in time for Mother \u2019 s Day ; \u201c I have missed my kids . The fight is for them , \u201d she told reporters .\nVizguerra \u2019 s stay was granted thanks to the involvement of local members of Congress , under a procedure that has become more stringent under Trump . In other cases , the administration has simply decided to grant extensions ( often short-term ones ) to particularly sympathetic immigrants .\nIn June , ICE was set to deport Florida resident Reina Gomez , a 49-year-old with a terminal cancer that she claims can \u2019 t be treated in her home country of Honduras \u2014 making deportation a \u201c death sentence. \u201d But after a public outcry , she was given , first , a two-week extension to consider her asylum application \u2014 then a one-year stay . The government was shamed .\nShame isn \u2019 t guaranteed , and a last-minute reprieve isn \u2019 t something anyone can count on ( not to mention the fact that a one-year stay of deportation is no more permanent than the six months for Haitians with TPS ) . The Trump administration is using discretion much less frequently than its predecessor . But it \u2019 s using discretion more frequently than it allows when it claims that it \u2019 s really \u201c the law \u201d that deports people . Because sending people the message that there is something they can do to remain in the United States would undermine the politics of fear .\nEven when the administration is trying to say that immigrants are safe from a particular fear or rumor , it \u2019 s unwilling to say that they \u2019 re safe . In a highly unusual move in early September , ICE put out a statement declaring it had no planned nationwide raid operations for the coming weeks \u2014 as a denial of widespread rumors that it was planning a massive nationwide sweep called \u201c Operation Mega \u201d to arrest more than 8,000 immigrants in mid-September . But the statement explicitly pointed to hurricane relief efforts in Florida and Texas as the reason the calendar had been cleared \u2014 leaving the obvious possibility that it could simply be rescheduled at a later date .\nSimilarly , the administration has all but said that it won \u2019 t send ICE lists of all immigrants who are set to lose DACA , allowing ICE to round up and arrest them as their protections expire . But it hasn \u2019 t made that promise explicitly , or promised to issue new guidance to agents about when they should and should not use DACA information for enforcement .\nThe rumors outstrip the policies \u2014 which is exactly the point\nWhen a community is this taut with fear , any news or sign or rumor attracts disproportionate attention . So any policy change \u2014 or any sign that a policy change is being considered \u2014 is often greeted as a signal that \u201c mass deportation \u201d is coming , or that it \u2019 s already here .\nSome DACA recipients are incredibly worried about getting rounded up when their protections expire . Some have even voiced a fear that they \u2019 ll be put in camps ( an image that evokes not only the concentration camps in which Japanese Americans were put during World War II but the \u201c tent cities \u201d of Trump pardon beneficiary Joe Arpaio ) . The panic is happening behind closed doors , far from the public debate over the fate of the DREAMers ( in which DACA recipients feel the need to portray themselves as brave , optimistic heroes ) , but it \u2019 s happening .\nThose who never had DACA have spent the past several months making the daily calculation about safety . Jeannette Vizguerra decided not to go to her ICE meeting because she had heard about what happened to those who did . Central American families have stopped showing up to immigration court proceedings because they \u2019 re worried they \u2019 ll lose their asylum cases \u2014 and their best chance to stay in the US is to hide out of ICE \u2019 s sight .\nSoon after Trump \u2019 s inauguration , local law enforcement started noting that Latinos were becoming less willing to report crimes . Judges have urged ICE not to make arrests in courtrooms because they might scare away victims from showing up to court . Immigration advocates in Houston believed it was likely , when Hurricane Harvey hit , that some unauthorized immigrants might have died because they stayed in their homes rather than evacuate along a route that featured a Border Patrol checkpoint .\nThe Trump administration tends to react to these fears with something resembling annoyance . Immigrants \u201c should feel safe to go and report criminal activity , \u201d acting ICE Director Homan told the press in July . But barely minutes later , he criticized , at length , the idea that \u201c we concentrate too much on those that are not criminal \u201d : \u201c We got to stop sending the message that people that do n't commit yet another crime should be forgotten , \u201d he said .\nThe message , he said , had to be as clear as possible : \u201c There is no safe haven here . \u201d\nUnauthorized immigrants themselves have gotten that message . Even without doing the heavy lifting of mass deportation , the administration has put together an enforcement regime that does just enough to remind immigrants they \u2019 re vulnerable \u2014 and lets fear do the rest .",

It\u2019s conducted a few high-profile, coordinated immigration raids \u2014 in which it\u2019s arrested both the people it was seeking out and anyone else who happened to be around and deportable. One ICE source said in March that the government was deliberately planning raids in \u201csanctuary cities\u201d \u2014 an effective way to remind immigrant communities that even if their local government was trying to lower their risk of deportation, it couldn\u2019t actually protect immigrants from the feds.\n\nTrump\u2019s ICE is arresting more immigrants than it did under Obama\u2019s last couple of years in office.

There were 750,000 \u201cconvicted criminal aliens\u201d; it\u2019s unclear how many people fell in the other two categories, but the total number of people prioritized as of January 19, 2017, was almost certainly less than 2 million \u2014 possibly much lower.\n\nOn January 25, 2017, the pool of immigrants \u201cprioritized\u201d \u2014 or at least not unprioritized \u2014 for deportation swelled to something like 10 million.\n\nFrom mass deportation to self-deportation to mass fear\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s eyes were much bigger than its capacity.\n\nThe administration is operating on a budget and with a workforce set under its predecessor \u2014 which devoted much more effort to deporting immigrants from within the US than the government ever had before, but was still equipped for no more than 400,000 deportations per year. And due to the staggering immigration court backlog, those deportations are often of immigrants who were arrested years prior.\n\nA government capable of deporting all 11.1 million unauthorized immigrants over two presidential terms would need four times the deportation capacity it currently has. Even modestly increasing deportation capacity would require an investment, in the Department of Justice (which runs immigration courts) as well as the Department of Homeland Security, that\u2019s likely to sit uneasily with congressional Republicans who aren\u2019t even enthusiastic about paying $1.5 billion for a few dozen miles of border \u201cwall.\u201d\n\nActually carrying out mass arrests and deportations of long-resident, law-abiding unauthorized immigrants \u2014 \u201cgood\u201d immigrants \u2014 could generate a serious outcry (fueled by photos of families being separated by ICE agents). Many Republicans are already concerned about the politics of Trump\u2019s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which currently protects over 700,000 young unauthorized immigrants from deportation and allows them to work in the US legally; the politics of deporting them, along with their parents, would be even worse.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a new problem. It\u2019s why intellectual immigration hawks have long preferred \u201cself-deportation\u201d (also known as \u201cattrition through enforcement\u201d) over mass deportation. It might not be as brutally effective \u2014 even the most optimistic accounting suggests that 5 million immigrants could eventually be pushed to \u201cself-deport\u201d over the course of several years \u2014 but it\u2019s much cheaper.\n\nWhat Trump is doing isn\u2019t quite \u201cself-deportation\u201d either, though. The point of \u201cself-deportation\u201d is that the government is using all the tools at its disposal to make it hard to support a life and a family in the US without papers \u2014 and the centerpiece of that is making it impossible to get a job under the table, by mandating all businesses use the E-Verify system and cracking down on employers who hire unauthorized workers.\n\nThe Trump administration isn\u2019t doing that. Its legislative agenda on immigration is focused on \u201cthe wall\u201d and on cutting legal immigration rather than E-Verify; it hasn\u2019t stepped up workplace immigration enforcement much (drawing ire from Laura Ingraham\u2019s website, which called workplace enforcement the \u201csoft spot\u201d of Trump\u2019s policy).\n\nInstead of using a variety of tools, it\u2019s using a combination of policy and messaging to keep the threat of deportation hanging over immigrants\u2019 heads. It\u2019s not trying to get them to go home because they can\u2019t stay here; it\u2019s making sure they don\u2019t get too comfortable here because they could be taken at any minute.\n\nIt\u2019s a general law enforcement principle. Here\u2019s how US Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley put it: When they have enough agents on a shift to catch all of the people or drugs they expect to enter the US during that time, they use their resources to catch those people and drugs. It\u2019s only when they show up and realize they\u2019re way undermatched (something they emphasize hasn\u2019t happened in several years) that they bring out the floodlights and do circuits through the streets with sirens blaring \u2014 the \u201chigh-visibility\u201d tactics.\n\nICE, the Border Patrol\u2019s sister immigration force, appears to be doing something similar \u2014 not to deter immigrants from coming, but to remind those already here that their existence in the US is not a secure one.\n\nFear is hard to attack because it\u2019s hard to see. It doesn\u2019t spark political protests. It may not even be noticed by Americans who don\u2019t know any immigrants. It\u2019s easy to deflect onto others for causing fear \u2014 blaming immigrant organizations, for example, for spreading rumors of ICE raids. It leaves few fingerprints. And it takes little cash.\n\nThe six-month countdown clock\n\nThe January executive order let exactly one Obama-era protection stand \u2014 the DACA program \u2014 despite Trump\u2019s promises to end Obama\u2019s \u201cunconstitutional executive orders\u201d on \u201cday one\u201d on the campaign trail.\n\nFor months, the administration publicly weighed DACA\u2019s fate (even as, behind the scenes, ICE got more active in stripping protections from DACA recipients, sometimes based on disputed claims of gang affiliation). Every time Trump or his government declared that the program was still in effect, a DHS spokesperson hastened to clarify that they meant \u201cfor now.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cfor now\u201d is over.\n\nTrump has already mischaracterized his DACA decision as one to keep the program for the next six months while it waits for Congress to act, and then start allowing protections and work permits issued under the program (which last for two years) to expire. (Democrats have announced they\u2019ve reached the broad outlines of a deal on DACA, but the exact details have yet to be worked out.)\n\nThe reality is that the program is winding down now. Immigrants who would have qualified for the program had they turned 15 in August, but instead turn 15 in October, will be locked out; immigrants whose DACA protections are set to expire on March 4 have only until October 5 to collect their paperwork (and $495) and apply for one last renewal.\n\nFor immigrants whose DACA protections are set to last through the next six months \u2014 who, in theory, aren\u2019t supposed to be worried \u2014 there\u2019s a world of difference between knowing when their work permits will expire and being able to quiet their minds until then. The expiration date isn\u2019t a start date; it\u2019s an end date. President Trump says the DREAMers should be turning their hopes to Congress, but his White House\u2019s talking points urge them to start making plans to leave the country when their work permits expire.\n\nAnd in the meantime, the Trump administration is already tightening the reins on DACA recipients. Border Patrol has started to detain DACA recipients at internal checkpoints, \u201cfor accuracy and verification of status,\u201d sometimes holding them for several hours.\n\nThe Trump administration knows that telling people they have six months before being returned to the pool of vulnerability is a warning rather than a reprieve. It\u2019s used that strategy deliberately with Haitians living in the US under Temporary Protected Status, issued after the 2010 earthquake \u2014 who are currently months into a six-month extension of protections that the government has all but promised will be their last.\n\nTemporary Protected Status is issued to people who are living in the US from a particular country, who don\u2019t have a legal status that allows them to stay (either because they\u2019re here on short-term visas or because they\u2019re unauthorized) but, due to a natural disaster or other crisis in their home countries, can\u2019t safely return either. The longer that people are protected in the US, however, the more they put down roots here, and the less sensible it appears to revoke their protections \u2014 especially because the alternative is returning to a country that may still be on the long road to recovery from crisis. So previous governments have tended to extend TPS protections when a country comes up for review.\n\nDHS under Kelly, however, wanted to put the \u201ctemporary\u201d back in \u201cTemporary Protected Status.\u201d When TPS for Haitians came up for review in spring, Kelly granted a six-month extension but warned, \u201cI believe there are indications that Haiti \u2014 if its recovery from the 2010 earthquake continues at pace \u2014 may not warrant further TPS extension past January 2018.\u201d\n\nKelly openly acknowledged he was sending a message to Haitians \u2014 and other TPS beneficiaries. \u201cThe message is: By definition, TPS is temporary,\" he said in a press conference in Miami in June.\n\nAnd by sending that message, he wanted to get recipients to \u201cstart thinking now about what will happen in the not-too-distant future.\u201d The memo extending TPS through January made that a little clearer. \u201cThe Department of Homeland Security urges Haitian TPS recipients who do not have another immigration status to use the time before Jan. 22, 2018 to prepare for and arrange their departure from the United States \u2014 including proactively seeking travel documentation \u2014 or to apply for other immigration benefits for which they may be eligible.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the same language the White House talking points would use, months later, for DACA recipients.\n\nSome Haitians have already \u201cprepared for and arranged\u201d their travel \u2014 to Canada, where they\u2019re seeking asylum. But others, clinging to the fact that the Trump administration hasn\u2019t officially declared that TPS will end, are resistant to make plans to leave the country that many of them have lived in for most of their lives. \u201cI have nothing to go back to,\u201d Uber driver and would-be college student Jean Jubens Jeanty told the New York Times in July. \u201cWhy not keep me here?\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t optimism. It\u2019s simply not having alternatives. \u201cIt\u2019s very unsettling,\u201d a Queens College senior told the Times, \u201cto know that you\u2019re here and you don\u2019t know what tomorrow is going to bring, or what is going to happen in the next couple of months.\u201d\n\nLosing TPS wouldn\u2019t create certainty \u2014 it would just open up a deeper anxiety, in which fear of being deportable is replaced with fear of actually getting deported.\n\nThe government\u2019s official line that Haitians should prepare to leave the US isn\u2019t a promise to deport them if they don\u2019t, or at least not a promise the government can keep. There are 58,000 Haitian TPS recipients; the government will have to make a decision by January about whether to keep protecting 86,000 Hondurans with TPS, and a decision by March about the fate of 263,000 Salvadorians.\n\nThose are numbers too big to round up and arrest with the resources the government has now, or can get in the next six months. But dumping them into the pool of vulnerability, and making it clear that they could get arrested at any time with no legal recourse? It costs much less to send a message.\n\nThe law doesn\u2019t deport people. People deport people.\n\nThe fact that anyone living in the US without papers could be caught by ICE at any time is only part of the politics of fear. The other part is making it seem that anyone caught by ICE is inevitably going to get deported, and there\u2019s nothing they or their lawyers can do to stop it.\n\nThe biggest practical obstacle to mass deportation is the immigration court backlog \u2014 in practice, it takes years to deport someone who hasn\u2019t already been ordered deported. The Trump administration hasn\u2019t yet put much effort into moving people through immigration court faster. Instead, it\u2019s tried to portray the deportation process as a one-way journey \u2014 slow, but inevitable.\n\n\u201cTrump doesn\u2019t deport people,\u201d John Kelly used to say as head of DHS. \u201cThe law deports people.\u201d\n\nKelly has left the department for the White House, but that sentiment remains; on a press briefing about the process of DACA rescission, one DHS official praised Trump as \u201cthe first president who\u2019s asked us to enforce the law as written, and not some executive interpretation of the law.\u201d (That official, somewhat ironically, went on to assure reporters that even after losing DACA protections, DREAMers would remain \u201clow enforcement priorities\u201d \u2014 something that is neither in the text of \u201cthe law\u201d nor in the text of any of the Trump administration\u2019s guidance on the matter.)\n\nThis isn\u2019t just rhetoric; it\u2019s policy.\n\nUnder Obama, immigrants and their lawyers could often persuade ICE that they weren\u2019t high enough enforcement priorities to merit spending resources on an immigration court prosecution; the immigration court case would be \u201cadministratively closed,\u201d and the immigrant would be given a stay of deportation.\n\nThat practice has all but ended.\n\nFrom February to June 2016, the Obama administration administratively closed an average of 2,400 cases a month. From February to June 2017, the Trump administration closed an average of fewer than 100.\n\nAn immigration lawyer told Vice that the key to closing immigration cases used to be \u201cshaming the government\u201d \u2014 but \u201cnow, the government is shameless.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s certainly worked to appear shameless. Immigrants whose arrests provoked widespread media alarm and protests, like Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos (arrested in February after 22 years in the US), might have been spared by the Obama administration\u2019s desire to avoid bad press. The Trump administration deported Rayos in the middle of the night.\n\nBut it\u2019s not actually true that the government is never showing discretion or leniency. There are cases where it has, in fact, been successfully shamed.\n\nJeannette Vizguerra spent most of the spring in the basement of a church in Denver; she heard about people like Rayos getting arrested when they went in for ICE check-ins, and decided not to risk it. Because she missed her check-in, she was ordered deported in absentia \u2014 meaning she could be deported without going through immigration court. But she stayed in the church for months, and ICE agents didn\u2019t dare go in and get her.\n\nAnd then in May, ICE granted Vizguerra (and another Denver-area immigrant who\u2019d taken church refuge) a stay of deportation. She was able to return home in time for Mother\u2019s Day; \u201cI have missed my kids. The fight is for them,\u201d she told reporters.\n\nVizguerra\u2019s stay was granted thanks to the involvement of local members of Congress, under a procedure that has become more stringent under Trump. In other cases, the administration has simply decided to grant extensions (often short-term ones) to particularly sympathetic immigrants.\n\nIn June, ICE was set to deport Florida resident Reina Gomez, a 49-year-old with a terminal cancer that she claims can\u2019t be treated in her home country of Honduras \u2014 making deportation a \u201cdeath sentence.\u201d But after a public outcry, she was given, first, a two-week extension to consider her asylum application \u2014 then a one-year stay. The government was shamed.\n\nShame isn\u2019t guaranteed, and a last-minute reprieve isn\u2019t something anyone can count on (not to mention the fact that a one-year stay of deportation is no more permanent than the six months for Haitians with TPS). The Trump administration is using discretion much less frequently than its predecessor. But it\u2019s using discretion more frequently than it allows when it claims that it\u2019s really \u201cthe law\u201d that deports people. Because sending people the message that there is something they can do to remain in the United States would undermine the politics of fear.\n\nEven when the administration is trying to say that immigrants are safe from a particular fear or rumor, it\u2019s unwilling to say that they\u2019re safe. In a highly unusual move in early September, ICE put out a statement declaring it had no planned nationwide raid operations for the coming weeks \u2014 as a denial of widespread rumors that it was planning a massive nationwide sweep called \u201cOperation Mega\u201d to arrest more than 8,000 immigrants in mid-September. But the statement explicitly pointed to hurricane relief efforts in Florida and Texas as the reason the calendar had been cleared \u2014 leaving the obvious possibility that it could simply be rescheduled at a later date.\n\nSimilarly, the administration has all but said that it won\u2019t send ICE lists of all immigrants who are set to lose DACA, allowing ICE to round up and arrest them as their protections expire. But it hasn\u2019t made that promise explicitly, or promised to issue new guidance to agents about when they should and should not use DACA information for enforcement.\n\nThe rumors outstrip the policies \u2014 which is exactly the point\n\nWhen a community is this taut with fear, any news or sign or rumor attracts disproportionate attention. So any policy change \u2014 or any sign that a policy change is being considered \u2014 is often greeted as a signal that \u201cmass deportation\u201d is coming, or that it\u2019s already here.\n\nSome DACA recipients are incredibly worried about getting rounded up when their protections expire. Some have even voiced a fear that they\u2019ll be put in camps (an image that evokes not only the concentration camps in which Japanese Americans were put during World War II but the \u201ctent cities\u201d of Trump pardon beneficiary Joe Arpaio). The panic is happening behind closed doors, far from the public debate over the fate of the DREAMers (in which DACA recipients feel the need to portray themselves as brave, optimistic heroes), but it\u2019s happening.\n\nThose who never had DACA have spent the past several months making the daily calculation about safety. Jeannette Vizguerra decided not to go to her ICE meeting because she had heard about what happened to those who did. Central American families have stopped showing up to immigration court proceedings because they\u2019re worried they\u2019ll lose their asylum cases \u2014 and their best chance to stay in the US is to hide out of ICE\u2019s sight.\n\nSoon after Trump\u2019s inauguration, local law enforcement started noting that Latinos were becoming less willing to report crimes. Judges have urged ICE not to make arrests in courtrooms because they might scare away victims from showing up to court. Immigration advocates in Houston believed it was likely, when Hurricane Harvey hit, that some unauthorized immigrants might have died because they stayed in their homes rather than evacuate along a route that featured a Border Patrol checkpoint.\n\nThe Trump administration tends to react to these fears with something resembling annoyance. Immigrants \u201cshould feel safe to go and report criminal activity,\u201d acting ICE Director Homan told the press in July. But barely minutes later, he criticized, at length, the idea that \u201cwe concentrate too much on those that are not criminal\u201d: \u201cWe got to stop sending the message that people that don't commit yet another crime should be forgotten,\u201d he said.\n\nThe message, he said, had to be as clear as possible: \u201cThere is no safe haven here.\u201d\n\nUnauthorized immigrants themselves have gotten that message. Even without doing the heavy lifting of mass deportation, the administration has put together an enforcement regime that does just enough to remind immigrants they\u2019re vulnerable \u2014 and lets fear do the rest.",
