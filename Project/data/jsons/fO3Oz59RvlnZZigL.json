A McClatchy-Marist poll released this week shows 54 percent of Americans think the country is still in an economic downturn . But that dreary assessment is actually a big improvement considering that as recently as March , 63 percent thought the country was in a recession .\nNow Obama is launching an effort to renew focus on job creation for the middle class .

And on Monday , Obama told supporters that upon this return to Knox , he will deliver `` a pretty good speech . ''\nSo as the White House gets ready for this new campaign to begin , let 's take stock of five key indicators of economic health :\nJobs : Most economists say that nothing matters more than job growth . More jobs can quickly translate into more people buying cars , moving into new homes , taking vacations and otherwise stimulating growth .\nBut job creation has been slow throughout the recovery , with the unemployment rate staying stuck at 7.6 percent . This spring , the hiring pace picked up , to around 200,000 new jobs per month . In more normal times , that rate would give a president bragging rights , but at a time when 11.8 million remain out of work and another 8.3 million are stuck in part-time jobs , the economy is not adding enough paychecks .\nHousing : After a tough \u2014 no , make that hideous \u2014 run of foreclosures and price plunges , the housing market finally is improving . The sector peaked in 2006 , and then went into a nose dive that pushed prices down by roughly a third .\nBut the widely followed S & P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices show average home prices have popped back up by roughly 12 percent over the past year . And mortgage defaults have been easing . So the market appears to be healing , though many homeowners are still a long way from seeing their real estate values return to 2006 levels .\nDebt/deficit : The long-term national debt hovers at $ 16.75 trillion , roughly the same size as the entire U.S. economy . But thanks to this year 's federal spending cuts and tax hikes , the annual budget deficit is shrinking fast .\nThe Congressional Budget Office says the fiscal 2013 deficit probably will decline to just 4 percent of GDP , down dramatically from 7 percent in 2012 . By 2015 , the deficit should be down to about 2 percent of GDP \u2014 a level that most economists would say is quite manageable . In light of such improvement , Moody 's this month upgraded the U.S. credit rating outlook from negative to stable .\nInterest rates : Whether they 're buying a car or a home , most Americans are very concerned about interest rates . Over the past three months , mortgage rates have been heading higher , up from roughly 3.5 percent in early May to about 4.5 percent now for a 30-year-fixed mortgage .
