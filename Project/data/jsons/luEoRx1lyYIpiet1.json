    "content": "This is one of the better gun-control proposals around , even if that \u2019 s not saying much .\nMuch as we did after Sandy Hook , we find ourselves debating background checks in the wake of killings that would not have been prevented by one . More than 60,000 Americans died by gun homicide between 2013 and 2017 , but our attention is drawn only to the rarest , most spectacular , and most unusual incidents , those where a half-day or so \u2019 s worth of fatalities happen all in one place \u2014 and in those , it is usually the case that the deranged killer bought his guns legally or took them from someone else who did .\nBut then again , now is as good a time as any to talk about measures that could affect the killings where that is not the case . And as far as gun-control proposals go , universal background checks are among the better ones : They are politically feasible , might actually reduce gun violence on the margins , and would not unduly burden law-abiding gun owners . There are countless reasons to be less trigger-happy about them than their most ardent supporters are , but if political pressure forces Republicans to give ground on something big , this might be the best way to go .\nMost murders are committed by people who are not legally allowed to have firearms , whether because they have disqualifying criminal records or because they are too young . Obviously , though , they don \u2019 t pay much attention to the laws barring them from gun possession . The idea behind background checks is to leverage the law-abiding nature of other people who might stop guns from falling into these folks \u2019 hands .\nUnder federal law , licensed gun dealers have long been required to conduct background checks on all buyers and store the resulting records for two decades ( so that each gun can be traced to its original buyer via its serial number ) . However , this rule does not apply to private individuals who sell guns from their personal collections . Much ink has been spilled arguing over exactly what percentage of gun sales are completed without a background check , but frankly the overall number is irrelevant . What matters is simply whether private sales are common enough to be easily accessible to the small fraction of gun buyers with criminal intentions , which they are .\nIn addition , the current system makes it hard to trace guns that have changed hands many times , and hard to prosecute someone who sold a gun to a criminal . In effect , you have to show that the seller knew the buyer wasn \u2019 t allowed to have the gun . It \u2019 s not enough to show that he transferred a gun to a complete stranger with no questions asked .\nThe individual criminals roaming the streets with guns typically get their weapons informally , through friends and black-market sellers who are not likely to comply with a background-check law . But since just about every gun in the U.S. begins its life with a legal sale from a gun store , it \u2019 s clear that each crime gun must transition from the legal market to the illegal one at some point . Unfortunately , precise data on this process are hard to come by : The ATF has numbers on where traced crime guns were bought and where they ended up , which reveal a flow of guns from states with liberal gun laws to states with strict ones , but the steps in between are hard to nail down without a thorough investigation of each individual case . Often the crossover point takes the form of theft , but trafficking is a problem as well \u2014 where individuals procure guns through legal sales and then divert them to the illegal market .\nAt least in theory , universal checks could stop private sellers from inadvertently selling their guns to traffickers with criminal records . And greater documentation of private sales could deter traffickers from getting guns this way even if they could pass the checks .\nSome states have already passed laws like this , but unfortunately , state-level background-check laws are destined to be limited in their effectiveness \u2014 for the simple reason that it \u2019 s easy enough to cross state lines with a bunch of guns in the trunk . Research on their effects is inconclusive . ( I \u2019 ve discussed studies on both sides here and here . )\nBut there \u2019 s at least a decent logical case that universal checks could make a difference , especially on the federal level , which is more than we can say for a lot of other anti-gun policies . And let \u2019 s face it : \u201c Please make sure the person buying your gun is not a felon \u201d is really not that much to ask .\nThat \u2019 s the promise . There are also pitfalls . Here I \u2019 ll reproduce and update a list of questions about how to structure a background-check law that I first wrote in 2015 .\nHow are we going to enforce this ? One recent study looked at the effects of background-check laws in Washington , Colorado , and Delaware . The stunning result : In the first two of those states , a background-check law didn \u2019 t even measurably increase background checks . Obviously , if you pass a background-check law and everyone ignores it , it won \u2019 t make a difference . For this law to work it would need to be enforced , including in areas of the country where neither the population nor local law enforcement has any interest in doing so . Is the federal government going to do sting operations trying to buy guns via private sales throughout the U.S. ? Will it aggressively pursue those whose guns wind up at crime scenes and make an example of them ? Will we also require gun owners to report thefts , so they can \u2019 t wait until the ATF is at their door to claim their weapon was stolen ?\nWhich gun transfers require checks ? Manchin-Toomey , the bipartisan background-check bill that came to the fore after Sandy Hook and is being bandied about once again today , is limited to sales that took place at gun shows or were advertised publicly . A requirement of background checks in a broader swath of transfers , while difficult to enforce in real time and harder to sell politically , would aid the prosecution of those who transfer guns to criminals . Other tricky issues include how to permit inheritances , gifts , and the temporary borrowing of guns among family and friends without creating loopholes or making criminals of innocent people .

All this would become even more complicated with private sales in the mix \u2014 different sales of a gun would be documented at different stores , and the gun \u2019 s various owners would need to point police to each new dealer . One solution would be to have gun manufacturers , rather than stores , keep track of who has purchased their guns : If the gun is a Ruger , Ruger has its records . Another would be for stores to report the serial numbers of the guns they \u2019 ve sold , but not the buyers \u2019 information , to a searchable federal database .
