Palmer tries to be fair-minded , but he nonetheless expresses `` ambivalence , '' `` suspicion , '' and `` visceral discomfort '' about the fact that these men and women are motivated to make `` long-term commitments to address the health problems of poor Africans , '' to `` risk their lives , '' and to accept poor compensation ( and sometimes none at all ) because of their Christian faith .\nPalmer mentions a lack of data and an absence of regulatory oversight . But he 's honest enough to admit that these are n't the real reasons for his concern . The real reason is that he does n't believe that missionaries are capable `` of separating their religious work from their medical work , '' even when they vow not to proselytize their patients .
