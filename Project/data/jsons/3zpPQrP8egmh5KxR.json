Now , nearly a year later , roughly the same number \u2014 60 percent \u2014 see Donald Trump as the winner when the votes are counted Monday night .\nFew on either side doubted last February that Hillary Clinton would win Iowa . Now , Democrats still expect her to win \u2014 but Republicans don \u2019 t .\nThat \u2019 s according to members of The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Caucus \u2014 a panel of influential strategists , operatives and activists in Iowa and the three other states that will cast ballots later in February : New Hampshire , South Carolina and Nevada .\nThe final survey before Iowans cast the first ballots in the 2016 contest , the new insiders poll represents the culmination of a nearly yearlong project . Over that period , Republican and Democratic insiders have seen the race turned upside down and their expectations for candidates like Walker and Jeb Bush dashed . In recent weeks , Ted Cruz was viewed as the favorite to win the caucuses only to be supplanted by Trump in the last poll before Iowa votes .\n\u201c Donald Trump has broken every rule of the Iowa caucus process , \u201d said one South Carolina Republican , who , like all the respondents , completed the survey anonymously . \u201c Yet it will continue to pay off . \u201d\nThe results just among Iowa Republicans were virtually identical to those in the other three early states : A majority see Trump as the most likely winner , with a significant number still believing Cruz will emerge in first .\nA number of Republicans said Cruz \u2019 s organization would catapult the Texas senator over Trump .\n\u201c The Cruz ground game will carry him across the finish line with Trump in a close second , \u201d said an Iowa Republican .\nBut even those Republicans who picked Cruz to finish on top concede he has slipped \u2014 not just in recent weeks , but in the past few days as well . One Iowa GOP insider cited a poor debate performance last week and controversial Cruz get-out-the-vote mailers that resembled official documents accusing individuals of a \u201c VOTING VIOLATION \u201d for past non-participation .\n\u201c I think it is nearly too close to call with Trump and Cruz , \u201d said one Iowa Republican who picked Cruz . \u201c I have a better handle on the Cruz ground game . Not sure what Trump has . However , while this is Cruz 's to lose \u2014 he has damaged himself badly in Iowa this week . Poor debate and the \u2018 shame \u2019 mailer are just two examples . \u201d\nThe 15 percent of GOP insiders who didn \u2019 t pick Trump or Cruz to win all selected Florida Sen. Marco Rubio , who is in third place in the polls .\nOutside Iowa , Republican insiders in the other early states \u2014 who largely oppose Trump \u2014 are watching intently . Some said Cruz would win \u2014 but conceded that might be wishful thinking .\n\u201c He \u2019 s close in the polling and has a better organization , \u201d said a New Hampshire Republican , who also conceded : \u201c Maybe [ I \u2019 m ] just not believing that Trump could actually win . \u201d\nOthers appear resigned to a Trump victory on Monday night \u2014 but are hoping to thwart him elsewhere .\n\u201c If Trump is going to be stopped , it is going to have to be in [ New Hampshire ] , \u201d said a Republican there .\nDemocratic insiders weren \u2019 t nearly as divided as their GOP counterparts : They said by a wide margin that Clinton will defeat Bernie Sanders on Monday night , crediting what they say is her vastly superior organization .\n\u201c Hands down , Clinton has the best operation , \u201d one Iowa Democrat said . \u201c It does n't matter who I speak to \u2014 whether it 's in a big county or small , on the western side of the state or eastern \u2014 they all say the same thing : They see no evidence of Sanders organizing . They have a lot of people , but none of them are trained or prepared for what will happen on Monday . The lesson they took from Obama \u2019 s 2008 win was that big crowds equate [ to ] support in a caucus room . They seem to [ forget ] that Obama also had the best caucus campaign Iowa had seen up to that point . Unfortunately for them , Clinton has a stronger operation than even Obama did then , and her supporters are more committed than theirs . \u201d\nOther Democrats said caucus-goers will go with their heads over their hearts and choose Clinton \u2014 much as they picked then-Sen.
