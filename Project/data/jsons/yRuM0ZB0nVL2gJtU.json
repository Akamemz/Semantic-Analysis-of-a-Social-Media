The risk premium will fall either when bond prices fall and interest rates rise or when equity prices rise , thereby reducing their expected return .\nThough traditional cyclical stocks like small-caps have outperformed of late \u2014 the Russell 2000 RUT , +2.99 % has risen 8.3 % during the past month versus the S & P 500 \u2019 s 2.9 % rise \u2014 others , like financial stocks have not .
