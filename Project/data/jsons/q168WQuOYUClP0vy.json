In an interview with ABC News \u2019 s George Stephanopoulos that aired Friday , the lawyer and fixer who was once so loyal to Donald Trump that he claimed he \u2019 d \u201c take a bullet \u201d for him , said that not only did Trump instruct him to pay off Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal , but he knew that doing so was \u201c wrong . \u201d\n\u201c Of course [ he knew it was wrong ] , \u201d Cohen said . \u201c He was very concerned about how this would affect the election. \u201d He explained to Stephanopoulos that \u201c nothing at the Trump Organization was ever done unless it was run through Mr. Trump . He directed me to make the payments , he directed me to become involved in these matters . \u201d\n\u201c He knows the truth . I know the truth . Others know the truth , \u201d Cohen continued . \u201c And here is the truth : people of the United States of America , people of the world , don \u2019 t believe what he is saying . The man doesn \u2019 t tell the truth . And it is sad that I should take responsibility for his dirty deeds . \u201d\n\u201c I am done with the lying , \u201d Cohen said . \u201c I am done being loyal to President Trump . \u201d\nCohen \u2019 s assertions underscored the legal liability the former fixer may pose to the president through his cooperation with special counsel Robert Mueller , which began after he pleaded guilty to tax fraud and campaign-finance violations in August . In November , Cohen fessed up to lying to Congress about the nature and timing of Trump \u2019 s business dealings with Russia .\nBoth matters have raised the specter of Trump \u2019 s impeachment and possibly even indictment , which seems to have rattled the president , who has now spent months lashing out at his \u201c weak \u201d former attorney . In one of his latest broadsides , Trump charged that Cohen was lying to \u201c embarrass the president \u201d and get a reduced prison sentence . But Cohen told Stephanopoulos that he had no desire to humiliate Trump , and that Mueller has a \u201c substantial amount of information \u201d to corroborate his assertions about the hush agreements and the Russia dealings .\nIn the face of such evidence , Trump \u2019 s legal team has gradually shifted its defense . After initially saying he had \u201c NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA , \u201d the president this week claimed his dealings with the Kremlin constituted \u201c peanut stuff \u201d that was actually \u201c very legal & very cool. \u201d And after long denying that the president had any knowledge of the hush payments , this week Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani told the Daily Beast that \u201c Nobody got killed , nobody got robbed . . .
