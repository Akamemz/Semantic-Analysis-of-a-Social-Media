    "content": "The news last week that federal authorities had to release 2,837 convicted sex offenders back onto the streets has renewed focus on a Supreme Court case that requires the government to release immigrants whose home countries won \u2019 t take them back .\nA report released last week by the Government Accountability Office said the nearly 3,000 sex offenders are part of the 59,347 immigrants who the courts have ruled can not be held , whom the U.S. has been unable to send home , and who instead were released under some sort of supervision as of September 2012 .\nThe GAO took a sample of the sex offender cases and concluded that about 5 percent of the time U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement didn \u2019 t ensure that the immigrants released were properly registered with local authorities as sex offenders .\n\u201c I \u2019 m surprised that only 5 percent of them are not properly registered , \u201d said Jessica Vaughan , director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies .\nShe said ICE isn \u2019 t particularly rigorous about monitoring many of those it releases .\nFollowing on news this year that ICE released a number of immigrants from custody and blamed automatic budget cuts , the latest report again highlights a thorny part of the immigration system .\nSEE ALSO : Immigrant-rights groups call for October rally in D.C .\nIn this case , the sex offenders and other immigrants \u2014 legal and illegal \u2014 who have been released are thanks to a 2001 Supreme Court ruling in what is known as the Zadvydas case .

The worst is Qatar , which takes an average of 800 days to issue the necessary deportation documents , according to ICE numbers that Ms. Vaughan obtained . That is followed by Cambodia at 522 days and Vietnam at 368 days .\nJudy Rabinovitz , deputy director at the American Civil Liberties Union \u2019 s Immigrants \u2019 Rights Project , said the GAO report highlights how the system is supposed to work : Once illegal immigrants are released , they are supposed to be under supervision , and ICE is supposed to make sure the sex offenders register with authorities according to state and local laws .\n\u201c The GAO report is focusing on the more important thing , which is that it \u2019 s the criminal justice system that \u2019 s responsible for these people and ICE should be cooperating with the criminal justice system , \u201d Ms. Rabinovitz said .\nICE regularly faces criticism from both sides of the immigration issue .\nAdvocates for strict enforcement want the agency to do more to detain dangerous immigrants it is trying to deport , and to do a better job of tracking those it doesn \u2019 t detain to make sure they don \u2019 t disappear into the country .
