    "content": "One might have expected the ninth Republican presidential debate to be a cut above the earlier edition . With Chris Christie out of the race and Ben Carson present but basically out of the running , it was a chance for the race to get serious , for the five candidates who could potentially win this thing to make their cases without much distraction from the B players .\nInstead , Donald Trump accused Jeb Bush of threatening to moon the kind people of New Hampshire .\nIt was an anarchic evening where even disciplined moderators had trouble keeping things on track . That 's par for the course for these things at this point , but the particular kind of chaos this time around was different , and did n't always play to the favor of Donald Trump , lord of chaos .\nWe wo n't know who `` really '' won until poll results trickle in . But in the meantime , here are the candidates who ended the night better off than they started it \u2014 and the ones who slipped .\nAfter a long campaign in which his name has become almost synonymous with failure and pathos , Jeb finally \u2014 finally \u2014 had a good night .\nIt may not have come to him entirely fairly . The whole debate he appeared to have the support of the live audience , who even raucously applauded his characteristically dull and platitudinous closing statement . This makes sense : Apparently only 600 of the 1,600 tickets to the event were given to the candidates , and the state and national party controlled most of the rest . The result was an enthusiastically pro-Jeb crowd .\nBut whatever the reason for their Bush love , it worked . Trump was frequently booed \u2014 and when he tried to argue the audience was stacked against him , he was booed even harder . And Jeb was given the chance to throw red meat not to GOP base voters , but to typical GOP establishment types .\nThat distinction is crucial . Defending the Iraq War is not something that , say , Tea Party activists are all that excited about doing . But it 's something longtime Republican activists who were involved in the South Carolina state party in the 2000s had to do all the time . George W. Bush was their guy for eight years . They stood by him . They knew all the attacks about him and recoiled at each one .\nSo when Trump decided to attack the Iraq War , and point out that the president who presided over 9/11 can not reasonably claim to have `` kept us safe , '' the crowd took it personally . And booed . And applauded when Bush fought back :\nBUSH : So here 's the deal . I 'm sick and tired of Barack Obama blaming my brother for all of the problems that he has had . ( APPLAUSE ) BUSH : And , frankly , I could care less about the insults that Donald Trump gives to me . It 's blood sport for him . He enjoys it . And I 'm glad he 's happy about it . But I am sick and tired ... TRUMP : He spent $ 22 million in ... ( CROSSTALK ) BUSH : I am sick and tired of him going after my family . My dad is the greatest man alive in my mind . ( APPLAUSE ) BUSH : And while Donald Trump was building a reality TV show , my brother was building a security apparatus to keep us safe . And I 'm proud of what he did . ( APPLAUSE ) BUSH : And he has had the gall to go after my brother .\nApplause , applause , applause . The Republican base might have moved on from George W. Bush , but the professional party operative class in the audience in South Carolina has not , and gave Bush one hell of a moment , which likely helped him with viewers in the state without that emotional attachment to the Bush legacy .\nEven better , he did n't have to answer for his flip-flop on whether Iraq was a mistake , even as Trump pressed him to do so . And best of all , Marco Rubio , Jeb 's main rival for the establishment vote , helped Bush out , declaring , `` I just want to say , at least on behalf of me and my family , I thank God all the time it was George W. Bush in the White House on 9/11 and not Al Gore . ''\nJeb also did something he 's been hesitant to do for much of this campaign : He embraced being a Bush . This is clearly part of a broader strategy , what with W coming back to campaign for his brother in South Carolina . But it 's a smart strategy . Bush was never going to win by hoping that people forgot he 's related to one of the most controversial figures in Republican history . But there is some residual goodwill in the party toward W , especially on national security , and Bush is uniquely positioned to exploit that at a moment when ISIS has made terrorism and Islamist radicalism much bigger issues than they 've been for years .\nJeb is still languishing in fourth in South Carolina polls . It 's too soon to declare he has momentum . But he gave about the best performance he could 've hoped for , which should give him a decent chance of outpacing Rubio and maybe even Cruz too in the state :\nThe longer , the bloodier , and the sillier this campaign season is , the better it is for the eventual Democratic nominee . And it does n't get much longer , bloodier , or sillier than the debate tonight .\nHere 's some stuff that actually happened tonight . After a campaign that 's mostly involved candidates falling over themselves to show their commitment to screwing over Latino undocumented immigrants , Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio started arguing over who spoke better Spanish \u2014 in Spanish :\nDonald Trump , the GOP frontrunner who won New Hampshire in a landslide and will almost certainly win in South Carolina too , stuck up for Planned Parenthood . To repeat : Less than a year after doctored undercover videos made the organization anathema to all Republicans and its defunding a key priority of the congressional GOP , the Republican frontrunner for president praised it :\nAnd Trump accused Jeb Bush of threatening to expose his buttocks to crowds of voters , an accusation that is , amazingly , not entirely without merit !\nTRUMP : Two days ago he said he would take his pants off and moon everybody , and that 's fine . Nobody reports that . He gets up and says that , and then he tells me , oh , my language was a little bit rough\u2026\nIf it had been scripted , it would 've been the greatest surrealist masterpiece this side of Luis Bu\u00f1uel , but to any general election swing voters watching , it was just a clown show . The most reasonable person onstage was defending the Iraq War at great length . That 's bananas !\nWorse still for Republicans , it left the race still largely unsettled . Probably the best hope for a swift end to the primary is for Trump to just keep winning everything \u2014 but Trump had one of his worst nights to date . Probably the best hope for an establishment contender to win is for John Kasich to realize he ca n't do well outside New Hampshire and drop out , for Rubio to acknowledge that he 's toast and do the same , and for Jeb ! to rise up and save the day . But while Jeb had a good night , it was n't a so-good-he-knocked-out-his-rivals night .\nAnd Ted Cruz gave a perfectly fine performance that should keep him firmly in second place , or even give him the potential to repeat his Iowa victory over Trump a few more times and throw the race into still further chaos .\nThe takeaway from tonight was that this race will last a long time , it will involve a lot more ridiculous debates like this , and it will continue to make the Republican party look like a silly mess . That 's all great news for Hillary and Bernie .\nNo moderator could 've completely contained the madness that was tonight 's debate . Jeb and Trump were too committed to going after each other , as were Rubio and Cruz , for them to respect time restrictions or refrain from demanding a right to respond when their names were so much as mentioned in passing .\nBut CBS 's John Dickerson nonetheless did a fine job , asking productive follow-up questions and , with a couple exceptions ( like a question about Trump 's profanity ) , mostly sticking to the substance . His back-and-forth with Ted Cruz pointing out that Anthony Kennedy was confirmed for the Supreme Court in an election year earned him boos from the audience , who saw him as nitpicky and eager to defend Obama 's nomination . But he was right , and he was keeping Cruz to the facts \u2014 which is crucial for a moderator .\nAnother highlight was Major Garrett 's questioning on Cruz 's tax plan . Garrett took it for granted that Cruz is proposing a value-added tax \u2014 which Cruz has denied , but which is absolutely true if you look at how it 's structured . Cruz denied it , but Garrett pressed him .\nDICKERSON : Mr. Trump , let me ask you a question . Presidents in both parties say that the one thing you need in your administration is somebody who can tell you you 're wrong . You do n't necessarily seem like somebody who has somebody who tells you you 're wrong a lot . Can you tell us of an instance where somebody has said , `` Donald Trump , you 're wrong , '' and you listened to them ? TRUMP : Well , I would say my wife tells me I 'm wrong all the time . And I listen . ( LAUGHTER ) DICKERSON : About what ? TRUMP : Oh , let me just say -- look , I am very open -- I hired top people . I 've had great success . I built a great , great company . I do n't need to do this . I 'm self-funding . I 'm spending a lot of money . I 've spent -- like in New Hampshire , I spent $ 3 million . Jeb bush spent $ 44 million . He came in five , and I came in No . 1 .\nTrump just did n't answer the question , even after Dickerson pressed him . The upshot was clear : Trump is n't capable , or is n't willing , of conceding literally any error . He really is exactly as arrogant as you think he is . And Dickerson demonstrated this not by saying it or arguing it but by having Trump show it for himself . That 's moderating at its finest .\nAnd he mostly got booed for having a point . He attacked the audience as stacked to be pro-Bush \u2014 which it appears to have been . He defended Planned Parenthood as doing important work besides abortions \u2014 which it does . And he attacked George W. Bush for launching a war in Iraq when there were no weapons of mass destruction and for failing to prevent 9/11 \u2014 both totally legitimate criticisms .\nBut they are not criticisms you make in a Republican debate . Trump has strayed from party doctrine before , but when he 's done so , it 's been on issues where the GOP is in a very different place from the establishment . He opposes cutting Social Security and Medicare , which enrages libertarian economic types within the party but delights actual voters , especially elderly ones . He wants big tariffs on China , which free-traders in the party hate but white working-class workers who actually vote for the party love .\nHere , though , he 's on his own . There 's not a huge Republican constituency for the idea that the Iraq War was not just bad but built on a lie :\nTRUMP : You do whatever you want . You call it whatever you want . I want to tell you . They lied . They said there were weapons of mass destruction , there were none . And they knew there were none . There were no weapons of mass destruction .\nNow , the general point here is true . Bush and Dick Cheney made claims about WMD and Iraq 's relationship with al-Qaeda that were n't just false , but which they knew to be false given the intelligence they had at the time , or for which they had no evidence at all . But it 's something that you 'd expect a Democratic primary contender to say , not a Republican . ( And throwing in `` they knew there were none '' is even a bit far for a Democrat . ) Trump is allowed his heterodoxies on some issues , but accusing the most recent Republican president of deliberately misleading the nation into a war is unlikely to appeal to just about any GOPer .\nSame with his claim on 9/11 . Here , Trump is n't merely critiquing Bush 's Iraq policy , something that 's a bit more acceptable within the GOP . He 's critiquing Bush 's terrorism record in general \u2014 and , implicitly , the overall Republican foreign policy consensus that the correct way to fight terrorism is through overwhelming force . That 's a consensus that 's lasted since Bush left office and is n't really challenged by any other candidate .\nTrump 's Planned Parenthood comments are perhaps most baffling at all . There really are n't that many pro-choice Republicans out there , or even many pro-life Republicans open to the aggressive promotion of birth control through groups like Planned Parenthood . And however many there were before the organization became a right-wing media boogeyman last year , there are almost certainly fewer now . There 's no reason for an undecided pro-life activist to watch that exchange and come away preferring Trump to his rivals .\nAll of this is bad for Trump on his own , but it 's especially bad given that Trump was unabashedly liberal before 2011 or so . He said in 2008 that Bush deliberately lied to start the war in Iraq , and attacked congressional Democrats for not impeaching him over it . In 1999 , he told Tim Russert he was `` strongly for choice '' :\nRepublican rivals have tried to attack him for this before , mostly without success . Voters saw Trump as authentic now , whatever his past beliefs ; why not believe the message ? But seeing elements of the old , more liberal Trump sneak through might give that critique new force .\nTrump is still winning this primary . He will probably win in South Carolina , and the rest of the field remains scattered enough that he stands a good shot of winning a majority of states in the `` SEC primary '' on March 1 . But tonight , more than any other debate , felt like a momentum where the tide could shift against him .\nIf his name were n't Marco Rubio , this guy would 've dropped out by now . Think about it : If , say , Chris Christie had gotten third in Iowa and then fifth in New Hampshire , and totally botched the pre\u2013New Hampshire debate , would anyone look at him and think , `` Yeah , this is a guy with a plausible path to the nomination '' ? Of course not . But because Rubio has been the one true hope of the Republican establishment for most of this cycle , he 's been given something of a pass .\nBut he still needs a way to take advantage of that lenience . He needs a way to beat back Bush and Kasich and emerge once again as the natural establishment rival to Cruz and Trump . And he needed , tonight , to overcome his last disastrous debate performance and prove to the establishment that he wo n't fail them again .\nWhat happened instead was a basically fine debate performance , devoid of any obvious gaffes , that nonetheless was woefully insufficient to turn around his dying campaign . His decision to attack Cruz more than Trump might have made strategic sense , but in practice it mostly gave Cruz a chance to remind voters , once again , that Rubio favors letting some undocumented immigrants become citizens . And every minute Rubio 's immigration views are the topic at hand , he loses .\nAnd when it came time for Rubio to attack Trump , he \u2026 defended Jeb Bush . `` I just want to say , '' he declared , `` at least on behalf of me and my family , I thank God all the time it was George W. Bush in the White House on 9/11 and not Al Gore . '' That is a great thing for a Bush surrogate to say , so as to build up the family reputation and give Jeb a hand . It 's a gracious but tactically baffling thing to say if you are trying to defeat Jeb Bush .\nRubio was n't a disaster . But he did n't need not-a-disaster . He needed a blockbuster performance that got him back to where he was immediately post-Iowa , with strong momentum and a media narrative of Rubio rising . He did n't get that , and it 's difficult to see now how he 's ever going to put himself back in contention .",
