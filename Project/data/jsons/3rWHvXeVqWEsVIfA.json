    "content": "President Trump speaks to reporters outside the White House , February 23 , 2018 . ( Jim Bourg/Reuters )\nHe is turning the Stormy Daniels story into a big deal .\nNot for nothing did we call my April 10 column \u201c Trump \u2019 s De Mini-Mess. \u201d It was a reference to what seemed a political tempest in a legal teapot : a hush-money payment to a porn star who claims to have had an extramarital sexual encounter with the president a decade before he was elected \u2014 shortly after Melania gave birth to Barron in 2006 . The lurid details make the matter a political land mine , but legally , it was , comparatively speaking , de minimis : a technical question of whether the payment , made by Trump \u2019 s sometime-lawyer and self-proclaimed \u201c fixer , \u201d Michael Cohen , was an \u201c in-kind \u201d campaign contribution under federal election laws .\nBy contrast , the investigation Special Counsel Robert Mueller is conducting into allegations of collusion with Russia and obstruction of justice is big stuff . It makes sense that the Trump camp has become increasingly combative in confronting it . If you \u2019 ve got a good defense , big stuff has to be fought hammer and tongs .\nIt usually doesn \u2019 t make sense to approach small stuff that way , though . That can turn small stuff into big stuff .\nAlas , Trump \u2019 s way is to punch down and to punch hard , no matter how trivial the challenger or the slight . The president has decided to fight hard against claims of a campaign-finance violation and against Stephanie Clifford , the porn star known as Stormy Daniels . That was made clear Wednesday night , in an appearance on Hannity by Rudy Giuliani ( Trump \u2019 s old friend and latest new lawyer ) . It was even clearer the next morning , when Trump took to Twitter .\nShortly after Stormy strutted into our little circus , I opined that , on the election-law question , \u201c the best argument in Trump \u2019 s favor is one that claims mitigation , not innocence. \u201d First , unlike Bill Clinton \u2019 s Lewinsky affair , Stormy \u2019 s alleged tryst with Trump occurred long ago and involved no abuse of presidential power or privilege . Second , as campaign-finance violations go , $ 130,000 is chump change . The 2008 Obama campaign was permitted to settle violations nearly 20 times the size of the Stormy payment by paying a fine to the FEC .\nNow , arguing mitigation instead of fighting on the merits means taking a less combative approach . Here , it would probably start with admitting guilt . Of course , no one ever wants to do that . Plus , the rules of the game are that Democrats get away with murder while Republicans get murdered . The Trump camp is understandably worried that , far from the see-no-evil approach the Justice Department took to the Obama campaign \u2019 s immense violations , Trump might get the Dinesh D \u2019 Souza treatment . D \u2019 Souza , an Obama critic , committed a puny $ 20,000 campaign-finance violation , but Obama \u2019 s Justice Department hit him with a multi-count felony indictment and pushed for a prison sentence when he pled guilty ( he was not imprisoned but confined for a time in a halfway house ) .\nAll that said , there is nothing but ugly for the president in fighting , and thus magnifying , the Stormy story .\nThe news reports write themselves : hush money before the election , the implausible denials of the conduct , the implausible denials of knowledge about the payment , the specter of cheating on Melania right after the birth of Barron Trump , Stormy \u2019 s allegation of an extortionate threat , the laugh-out-loud details of the non-disclosure agreement ( Trump as \u201c David Dennison \u201d and Stormy as \u201c Peggy Peterson \u201d ) , and so on . It thus seemed to me that the best course was to say as little as possible ; amend the campaign-finance disclosures ; try to settle the civil litigation with Ms. Clifford in California ( the story is out now , so what \u2019 s the point ? ) ; hope the Trump Justice Department , relying on the Obama 2008 precedent , would agree to a modest FEC fine to settle the matter ; and try to move on , drawing as little attention as possible to this tawdry tale \u2013 understanding , of course , that the media would try to keep it front and center .\nInstead , Trump is fighting . The mini-mess is becoming a maxi-mess .\nRudy Giuliani ( who hired me as a prosecutor in the Eighties ) clearly took Sean Hannity by surprise Wednesday night . He admitted that Trump reimbursed Cohen in installments over a number of months . This blows up both Trump \u2019 s story that he did not know about Cohen \u2019 s payment to Stormy and Cohen \u2019 s story that he did not tell Trump about it .\nYes , those stories were risible on their face , and it was only a matter of time that they \u2019 d be exposed \u2014 indeed , as some commentators have noted , it is probable that federal prosecutors in Manhattan already knew that Trump had reimbursed Cohen . Rudy was trying to get out in front of bad news that was going to break anyway .\nStill , the admission seemed startling , and within minutes the media frenzy was on . That was a strong signal that the upside of Trump \u2019 s legal defense on an abstruse regulatory matter would be vastly outweighed by the political damage from spotlighting Trump \u2019 s and Cohen \u2019 s false statements . Yet , the president upped the ante on Twitter . In a string of posts that were clearly ghost-written by lawyers ( here , here , and here ) , he asserted ( my italics ) :\nMr. Cohen , an attorney , received a monthly retainer , not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign , from which he entered into , through reimbursement , a private contract between two parties , known as a non-disclosure agreement , or NDA . These agreements are very common among celebrities and people of wealth . In this case it is in full force and effect and will be used in Arbitration for damages against Ms. Clifford ( Daniels ) . The agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair , despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair . Prior to its violation by Ms. Clifford and her attorney , this was a private agreement . Money from the campaign , or campaign contributions , played no roll in this transaction .\nWhile there are problems ( which we \u2019 ll come to ) with Rudy \u2019 s legalistic defense , Trump \u2019 s tweets go much further , appearing both to deny the sexual encounter and to threaten Clifford with robust enforcement of the NDA \u2013 a heavy-handed arrangement in which , in exchange for the $ 130K , she faces millions of dollars in penalties each time she spills the beans .\nThis seems crazy to me . No one believes the \u201c affair \u201d didn \u2019 t happen . And , because everyone knows who Trump is , no one much cared about it . . . until now . Now there will be wall-to-wall coverage to prove it happened , including coverage of Trump \u2019 s flings and interactions with women over the years ( some of which are alleged to involve unwanted advances ) , until he admits it . If he does , he will look terrible for inducing Stormy to sign a false denial letter and for relying on it . In the meantime , he will look terrible for appearing to threaten Stormy with the punitive NDA damages , which will lend credibility to her thus far uncorroborated claim that , in 2011 , an unidentified man threatened that she would be killed if she did not keep quiet . And the cherry on top : Trump \u2019 s tweet calls renewed attention to the NDA . While such agreements may be \u201c very common \u201d as Trump says , how \u201c very common \u201d is it to do them under silly pseudonyms instead of the parties \u2019 real names ? That question , as night follows day , will lead to more media discussion of the fact that Cohen used the very same pseudonyms in yet another hush-money arrangement with a major GOP donor and Trump supporter .\nSince the team obviously decided it was worth risking this political fallout to get their defense on the campaign-finance claim out there , we must ask : How good is the defense ?\nTurns out Trump \u2019 s was not the only Twitter account buzzing Thursday morning . Prominent Washington lawyer George Conway tweeted some guidance from the FEC ( my italics ) :\nNot considered the candidate \u2019 s personal funds Personal gifts and loans If any person , including a relative or friend of the candidate , gives or loans the candidate money \u201c for the purpose of influencing any election for federal office , \u201d the funds are not considered personal funds of the candidate even if they are given to the candidate directly . Instead , the gift or loan is considered a contribution from the donor to the campaign , subject to the per-election limit and reportable by the campaign . This is true even if the candidate uses the funds for personal living expenses while campaigning .\nGeorge \u2019 s tweets get attention , not just because he \u2019 s very smart but because he is a Trump critic who is married to a top Trump White House adviser , Kellyanne Conway . This one , I imagine , will get attention .\nSee , while the president was on Twitter gamely seeking to distance the Stormy hush money from the Trump campaign , Rudy was on television wrestling with the inconvenient fact that the payment was made on the eve of the election . Politico picks up the story :\nDuring a Thursday morning interview with \u201c Fox & Friends , \u201d Giuliani alluded to the idea that campaign considerations played into the October 2016 payment to Daniels . \u201c Imagine if that came out on October 15th , 2016 , in the middle of the , you know , last debate with Hillary Clinton , \u201d Giuliani said . \u201c Cohen didn \u2019 t even ask . Cohen made it go away . He did his job . \u201d\nNo doubt this is true : If Cohen \u2019 s job was to protect his client , Trump , it made sense to pay big bucks to suppress a story that could have been ruinous if it broke three weeks before the election . But that just highlights the nexus between the payment and the campaign .\nRudy \u2019 s theory does not fix that unfixable problem . He is relying on the fact that , though there are severe restrictions on what all other donors can contribute , there are no limits on a candidate \u2019 s own contributions to a campaign . Therefore , the argument goes , even if the Stormy payment were deemed an in-kind contribution , Trump , by reimbursing Cohen , ultimately paid the money himself , so there can \u2019 t have been a violation .\nThe harder you fight against small stuff , the bigger it appears if your story collapses .\nThat fails to account for two problems . First , even if Trump ultimately paid , Cohen still fronted the money . From the FEC \u2019 s perspective , that makes it a \u201c loan . . . for the purpose of influencing [ an ] election for federal office \u201d and thus \u201c reportable by the campaign. \u201d Second , even if we strip Cohen out of the equation and acknowledge that there were no limits on what Trump could spend on his own campaign , the campaign was still obliged to report Trump \u2019 s spending .\nThat \u2019 s a long-winded way of saying : The question is not just whether the payment was within legal contribution limits ; there is also the matter of whether the payment was reported to the FEC .\nNor do the reporting questions end there . According to the Washington Examiner , Norman Eisen , an Obama White House ethics lawyer who has also been tweeting , is pushing for an investigation of Trump \u2019 s public financial-disclosure report . Eisen points out that government officials are supposed to list loans they \u2019 ve received on the form ( known as an OGE-278 ) . He thus theorizes that Cohen \u2019 s fronting of the $ 130,000 that Trump eventually reimbursed was a loan subject to reporting , and he \u2019 s betting that Trump did not disclose it . I imagine we \u2019 ll find out . . . maybe on Hannity .\nNone of this stuff is the crime of the century . None of it is in the same league as tales of Russian espionage and obstruction of high-profile FBI investigations . But , as legal commentators and Trump critics are quick to point out , it is a felony punishable by five years \u2019 imprisonment to make false statements or material omissions on government disclosure forms . And the harder you fight against small stuff , the bigger it appears if your story collapses .\nI already miss the quiet calm of the Mueller investigation .",
