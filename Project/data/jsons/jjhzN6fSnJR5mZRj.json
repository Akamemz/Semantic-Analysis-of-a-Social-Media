( House Television via AP )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) \u2014 President Donald Trump was impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives Wednesday night , becoming only the third American chief executive to be formally charged under the Constitution \u2019 s ultimate remedy for high crimes and misdemeanors .\nThe historic vote split along party lines , much the way it has divided the nation , over a charge that the 45th president abused the power of his office by enlisting a foreign government to investigate a political rival ahead of the 2020 election . The House then approved a second charge , that he obstructed Congress in its investigation .\nThe articles of impeachment , the political equivalent of an indictment , now go to the Senate for trial . If Trump is acquitted by the Republican-led chamber , as expected , he still would have to run for reelection carrying the enduring stain of impeachment on his purposely disruptive presidency .\n\u201c The president is impeached , \u201d Pelosi declared after the vote . She called it \u201c great day for the Constitution of the United States , a sad one for America that the president \u2019 s reckless activities necessitated us having to introduce articles of impeachment . \u201d\nTrump , who began Wednesday tweeting his anger at the proceedings , pumped his fist before an evening campaign rally in Battle Creek , Michigan , boasting of \u201c tremendous support \u201d in the Republican Party .\n\u201c By the way , \u201d he told the crowd , \u201c it doesn \u2019 t feel like I \u2019 m being impeached . \u201d\nThe mood in the House chamber shifted throughout the day as the lawmakers pushed toward the vote . Democrats spun lofty speeches , framing impeachment as what many said was their duty to protect the Constitution and uphold the nation \u2019 s system of checks and balances . Republicans mocked and jeered the proceedings , as t hey stood by their party \u2019 s leader , who has frequently tested the bounds of civic norms .\nThe start of Trump \u2019 s Michigan rally was delayed as the voting was underway in Washington but once he took the stage he boasted of accomplishments and complained bitterly about his foes for two hours , defiant rather than contrite . He called Pelosi names and warned the impeachment would be politically disastrous for Democrats . He has called the whole affair a \u201c witch hunt , \u201d a \u201c hoax \u201d and a \u201c sham , \u201d and sometimes all three .\nPelosi , once reluctant to lead Democrats into a partisan impeachment , gaveled both votes closed , seeing the effort to its House conclusion , even at risk to her majority and her speakership .\nNo Republicans voted for impeachment , and Democrats had only slight defections on their side . The votes for impeachment were 230-197-1 on the first charge , 229-198-1 on the second . To mark the moment , voting was conducted manually with ballots .\nWhile Democrats had the majority in the House to impeach Trump , a vote of two-thirds is necessary for conviction in the Republican-controlled Senate . The trial is expected to begin in January , but Pelosi was noncommittal about sending the House articles over , leaving the start date uncertain . Senate leaders are expecting to negotiate details of the trial , but Democrats are criticizing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for saying he won \u2019 t be an impartial juror and already knows the outcome .\nWhat Pelosi called a sad and solemn moment for the country , coming in the first year after Democrats swept control of the House , unfolded in a caustic daylong session that showcased the nation \u2019 s divisions .\nThe House impeachment resolution laid out in stark terms the articles of impeachment against Trump stemming from his July phone call when he asked the Ukrainian president for a \u201c favor \u201d \u2014 to announce he was investigating Democrats including potential 2020 rival Joe Biden .\nAt the time , Zelenskiy , new to politics and government , was seeking a coveted White House visit to show backing from the U.S. as he confronted a hostile Russia at his border . He was also counting on $ 391 million in military aid already approved by Congress . The White House delayed the funds , but Trump eventually released the money once Congress intervened .\nNarrow in scope but broad in its charges , the impeachment resolution said the president \u201c betrayed the nation by abusing his high office to enlist a foreign power in corrupting democratic elections , \u201d and then obstructing Congress \u2019 oversight like \u201c no president \u201d in U.S. history .\n\u201c President Trump , by such conduct , has demonstrated that he will remain a threat to national security and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office , \u201d it said .\nRepublicans argued that Democrats were impeaching Trump because they can \u2019 t beat him in 2020 .\nSaid Rep. Chris Stewart of Utah : \u201c They want to take away my vote and throw it in the trash . \u201d\nBut Democrats warned the country can not wait for the next election to decide whether Trump should remain in office because he has shown a pattern of behavior , particularly toward Russia , and will try to corrupt U.S. elections again .\n\u201c The president and his men plot on , \u201d said Chairman Adam Schiff , D-Calif. , of the Intelligence Committee that led the inquiry . \u201c The danger persists . The risk is real . \u201d\nThe outcome brings the Trump presidency to a milestone moment that has been building almost from the time the New York businessman-turned-reality-TV host unexpectedly won the White House in 2016 amid questions about Russian interference in the U.S. election .\nDemocrats drew from history , the founders and their own experiences , including as minorities , women and some immigrants to the U.S. , who spoke of seeking to honor their oath of office to uphold the Constitution .
