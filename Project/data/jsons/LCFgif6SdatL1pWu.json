Obama also finally had a chance to respond to some of the attacks on Libya that have been coming his way .\nThat said , Romney did not lose in the same way that Obama lost the first debate . He was able to land some blows on the president when he spoke about the laggard state of the economy and about gas prices and the deficit .

He is the author of `` Jimmy Carter '' and of the new book `` Governing America . ''\nAt Tuesday night 's debate , President Obama said he immediately called the attack on our consulate in Benghazi , Libya , terrorism . The problem is n't only about whether the transcript shows he did or did not use those words ; it 's also about the ongoing , confusing statements made by his administration -- including the conflicting arguments made by the president and vice president at their two debates .\nFive weeks after the attack , the two most senior people in the government clashed over what took place .\nIf the president was right last night that he immediately called the Benghazi attack a terrorist act , why did vice president Joe Biden state at the Danville , Kentucky , debate just last week that intelligence agencies informed the administration that the attack was the result of protests that were under way ?\nInstead of debating Mitt Romney , Obama and Biden need to debate each other .\nRecall what Biden said in response to a question from Martha Raddatz :\nRaddatz : What were you first told about the attack ? Why - why were people talking about protests ? When people in the consulate first saw armed men attacking with guns , there were no protesters . Why did that go on ?\nBiden : Because that was exactly what we were told by the intelligence community . The intelligence community told us that . As they learned more facts about exactly what happened , they changed their assessment .\nFor context , Biden 's statement was a rebuttal to Rep. Paul Ryan 's charge that `` It took the president two weeks to acknowledge that this was a terrorist attack . ''\nEither the intelligence community told the president one thing and the vice president another ( and of course they did not do that ) , or the president and the vice president still do n't have a handle on what happened .\nThis administration has a political imperative to downplay terrorism in an effort to bolster their anti-terror credentials . With Osama bin Laden dead , they want the American people to believe that the administration is tough and terrorism is on the wane . That 's why they focused so much of their language on protests and a YouTube video , despite facts to the contrary provided to them by intelligence agencies .\nThis debate is n't over . National security is critically important . If the president 's account of what he knew right after the attack is so different than the vice president 's account , they have some explaining to do .\nAri Fleischer , a CNN contributor , was White House press secretary in the George W.

As his insistence visibly turned to uncertainty then to confusion , the entire fallacy of this GOP strategy was illuminated on live national television : Romney had so come to believe his own lies that he was genuinely stumped when presented with fact .\nIn the first debate , moderator Jim Lehrer appeared dazed as Romney spouted , according to ThinkProgress.org , 27 half-truths and straight up lies in a period of 38 minutes . In this debate , both Crowley and Barack Obama pushed back and fact-checked in real time in a genuine and noteworthy effort to pull this election back toward a factual center . Without the carefully crafted narrative that Romney 's team has reinforced as truth even to the candidate himself , Romney was forced to resort to nonsensical platitudes .\nNone will probably haunt him more than his already infamous `` binders full of women '' statement . His clumsy attempt to avoid having to give a definitive answer on equal pay for equal work led him into an anecdote about how as governor he had a binder full of women he could consider for Cabinet positions in Massachusetts . For those of us who have been waiting for our entire lives to be valued as equal to our male counterparts in the workplace , hearing that the governor 's definition of progress meant having our resumes in a book on shelf was a poor consolation prize .\nWhatever gender bump Romney received from Obama 's lackluster performance in the first debate may have evaporated as quickly as @ Romneys_Binder was created on Twitter .

I give President Barack Obama a slight edge in this debate , in large part because this Obama was so much better than the one in his first debate . He benefited tremendously from this comparison and the lowered expectations .\nMitt Romney gave a solid performance . He was articulate . He came armed with facts . There were some questions he dominated . But he did make some mistakes . He continuously became the moderator . He tried enforcing the debate rules , which he has a tendency to do and is awkward about it . And Romney repeatedly took on the role of himself questioning Obama . The problem with this was that it put the ball back in Obama 's court , giving him another chance to respond . Romney also flubbed the Benghazi issue .

The one who inspires us , gives us confidence that things will be better and that brighter days are in our future , will win this race . Fortunately , there are still three weeks of campaign and one more debate for these candidates to make us believe . These debates have become analogous to playoff games . Right now the score is one to one . The first debate was a blow-out victory for Romney . The second debate was a narrow victory for Obama . We have one more game to go . Play ball !\nAna Navarro , a Republican strategist and commentator , served as national Hispanic campaign chairwoman for John McCain in 2008 and national Hispanic co-chair for Jon Huntsman 's 2012 campaign . Follow her on Twitter @ ananavarro .\nAdios , Mitt-mentum . The wind in the Republican nominee 's sails , which began to freshen before the Denver debate and became gale-force after he dominated President Obama in their first encounter , changed direction Tuesday night . The aggressiveness that served Romney so well against a listless Obama in Round One became a liability against a fired-up and focused president in the town-hall format .\nRomney sneered and smirked through the president 's answers . He bullied the moderator ( though she refused to be cowed ) . He invaded Obama 's space . And more than once , he made the tactical mistake of answering his own questions rather than the people 's . Moderator Candy Crowley , who has suddenly become the b\u00eate noire of American conservatives , often had to scold Romney for not giving people a chance to ask their questions .\nIt was the most unappealing performance in a presidential debate since Al Gore nearly tackled George W. Bush in 2000 . And it was topped off by giving the president the opening he devoutly desired\u2014invoking his support for `` 100 percent '' of Americans during his closing statement , which allowed Obama to close the night by inveighing against Romney 's denunciation of the `` 47 percent . ''\nThe most nagging question that lingered from the first debate , for Obama supporters and skeptics alike , was whether the president actually wanted to serve another four years . He gave no evidence of it in Denver . But Obama answered that question emphatically in New York , not only by finding the energy he lacked last time , but by hitting every note that he needed to hit . Almost as well as Bill Clinton ( a high standard ) , he did the math on Romney 's fiscal proposals\u2014and at the very least , left an impression in undecided voters ' minds that it does n't seem to add up . He linked Romney to George W. Bush . And in the single surest sign that he was dominating this debate , he prevented Romney from capitalizing on the administration 's blundering response to the embassy attack in Benghazi .\nRomney 's `` bounce '' from the first debate was evidence that a small-but-crucial segment of voters are willing to give both these candidates a hearing . The likely outcome , in the interval before next Monday 's Round Three , is that many\u2014if not most\u2014will bounce back to the president . It wo n't be merely because Obama was as sharp this time as he was dull before ; it will also be because Romney kept all his aggression from Denver , and none of his charm .\nPresident Obama needed a good debate last night and he got one .\nMitt Romney followed a great first debate with a fail . His constant interruption of Candy Crowley and the president -- his peevish , `` Hall Monitor Mitt '' persona -- was not just a loss in terms of style points . It was revealing in terms of character . The CNN focus group found that the intense awkward interjections alienated swing voters and women in particular . Tweets to me used words like `` entitled '' and `` bully . '' Bottom line , it was n't presidential . It was small and self-important rather than big and magnanimous . And it will cost him momentum .\nThe president started the debate hot rather than warm ; he seemed almost too amped up . Romney did a better job relating to the audience as individuals at first . And then the insistent jockeying for time came , and the wheels started to come off his initially steady performance .\nThe Bengazi moment was also clarifying . Mitt Romney lost a major opportunity to press the president on a still-evolving issue of real vulnerability for this administration . President Obama 's commitment to bring the killers to justice felt hollow one month after the attack . But when Romney accused the president of blithely hitting the campaign trail instead of focusing on the crisis , President Obama 's response reflected real outrage at having matters of war and peace reduced to cheap political attacks . It was a defining moment .\nThe flip-flops came fast and furious , from new support for Pell Grants to the Dream Act , to name just a few . I 'm looking forward to a full fact check list . I was surprised that more social issues questions , on choice and marriage equality , did n't get asked . Energy and immigration got their fill of time , and China bashing was a favorite topic , not coincidentally because it resonates particularly well in Ohio . President Obama also had a notable moment of unusual honesty for a politician , telling a questioner frankly `` some of these jobs are n't coming back . ''\nRomney 's strongest suit in this campaign , his edge on questions of deficits and debt , came up rarely . The canned lines fell flat . And in Romney 's closing statement , he suddenly chose to speak more frankly about his faith than at any time yet , showing a warmth that had been missing for most of the debate .\nPresident Obama chose his closing statement to offer an unexpected defense of American Individualism while getting in a dig at Romney 's 47 % statement . Overall , the performance was everything Obama failed to do in the first debate : engaged and energetic , balancing vision with stats . He still has n't offered a clear second-term agenda , a persistent weakness of his campaign . But the personal and policy contrast was clear , and Obama came out on the winning side of this second debate .\nJohn Avlon is a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for Newsweek and The Daily Beast . He is co-editor of the book `` Deadline Artists : America 's Greatest Newspaper Columns . '' He is a regular contributor to `` Erin Burnett OutFront '' and is a member of the OutFront Political Strike Team . For more political analysis , tune in to `` Erin Burnett OutFront '' at 7 ET weeknights .\nThere are two main things people are looking for during these debates : Are you a strong leader , and are you on my side ?\nPresident Obama was clearly a strong leader last night . That became obvious when Gov . Mitt Romney crossed the line , politicized the deaths in Libya , and challenged the president 's integrity . The president looked directly at Romney , and said with firm resolve `` that 's not who I am . '' It will go down as one the great moments in American presidential debates .\nBut what about , `` are you on my side ? '' Quick take : Romney hurt himself with women . It sounded like he only discovered the issue of equal pay at age 55 , when he became governor -- and that his solution was to figure out a way for moms to get home in time to cook dinner . Romney 's `` binders full of women '' comment is already blowing up online , and I expect we 'll hear more about this over the next few days .\nOverall : The President of the United States was the President of the United States tonight . That will help him win a close election .\nVan Jones is president and founder of RebuildTheDream.com , an online platform for political innovation focused on policy , economics and media . He was President Obama 's green jobs adviser in 2009 .\nIt was Round 2 of the presidential rematch between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney . And it was feisty .\nBarack Obama was clearly the winner . He took command of the stage , respected the audience by giving them answers they could easily understand , and he did it with a smile .\nThe president came across as a thoughtful leader -- passionate , energetic , tough . Though it will be several days before anyone can fully digest the debate , some `` instant reaction '' is also permanently true : Barack Obama means what he says when he connects with the much-clich\u00e9d `` struggling middle class '' because he 's lived that life .\nModerator Candy Crowley , like Martha Raddatz in the vice presidential debate , had a difficult job : Moderating these debates is like dealing with two guys arguing over the last beer when the Super Bowl 's tied with a minute to go . But , as much as possible , she kept both men in their time limits and kept them within the framework of the question . She showed that moderators need to be journalists first , referees second .\nThe fact check on Benghazi will be replayed , but it was this response that showed Obama 's true resolve and character as commander in chief : `` The suggestion that anybody on my team ... would play politics and mislead , when we 've lost four of our own , governor , is offensive . ''\nObama won this debate as decisively as Romney won the first . He distinguished his plans from Romney 's and did not let Romney run from his statements or positions . He took pride in his accomplishments , acknowledged the work yet to be done and spoke with compassion , consistency , focus and vision . He spoke as one who is and deserves to be president .\nDonna Brazile , a CNN contributor and a Democratic strategist , is vice chairwoman for voter registration and participation at the Democratic National Committee . She is a nationally syndicated columnist , an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and author of `` Cooking With Grease . '' She was manager for the Gore-Lieberman presidential campaign in 2000 .\nBob Greene : When candidates have to answer to real people\nThe questioners and would-be questioners , waiting patiently for their chance to speak to the candidates , can be excused if there are moments when they may feel like props . The candidates -- during Tuesday night 's debate and during almost every town-hall debate -- are eager to hit the talking points they 've been rehearsing for days , to shift away from the audience 's questions and pound directly at their opponent , to own the stage .\nBut there is something exceedingly worthwhile about an evening like Tuesday 's : It is one of the few occasions when men like Barack Obama and Mitt Romney are told , in effect , by everyday Americans :\nHere 's what I want to know . You 're expected to answer me . If you do n't , you may not get the job you want . Oh , and by the way : You have two minutes .\nFor one night , two of the most powerful people in the nation know that they would do well to remember the names of people who know the candidates ' own names by heart . At the lofty level of society where men such as Obama and Romney have grown accustomed to living , they are the ones who always want the floor and can almost always count on having it . They 're used to setting the clock , not obeying it .\nFor us to think that a night like Tuesday is humbling to them -- a night where , in plain sight , they must answer to people they do n't know -- is probably unrealistic . Wednesday morning , they 'll be back to calling their own shots .\nBut the format of a town-hall debate is inherently designed to remind two men at the heights what it is like to answer to people , just like the rest of the world has to do . Maybe whoever wins the presidency in three weeks will , from time to time , think about that feeling . If so , the town hall will have been a success .",

Fortunately, there are still three weeks of campaign and one more debate for these candidates to make us believe. These debates have become analogous to playoff games. Right now the score is one to one. The first debate was a blow-out victory for Romney. The second debate was a narrow victory for Obama. We have one more game to go.

The wind in the Republican nominee's sails, which began to freshen before the Denver debate and became gale-force after he dominated President Obama in their first encounter, changed direction Tuesday night. The aggressiveness that served Romney so well against a listless Obama in Round One became a liability against a fired-up and focused president in the town-hall format.\n\nRomney sneered and smirked through the president's answers. He bullied the moderator (though she refused to be cowed). He invaded Obama's space. And more than once, he made the tactical mistake of answering his own questions rather than the people's. Moderator Candy Crowley, who has suddenly become the b\u00eate noire of American conservatives , often had to scold Romney for not giving people a chance to ask their questions.\n\nIt was the most unappealing performance in a presidential debate since Al Gore nearly tackled George W. Bush in 2000. And it was topped off by giving the president the opening he devoutly desired\u2014invoking his support for \"100 percent\" of Americans during his closing statement, which allowed Obama to close the night by inveighing against Romney's denunciation of the \"47 percent.\"\n\nThe most nagging question that lingered from the first debate, for Obama supporters and skeptics alike, was whether the president actually wanted to serve another four years. He gave no evidence of it in Denver. But Obama answered that question emphatically in New York, not only by finding the energy he lacked last time, but by hitting every note that he needed to hit. Almost as well as Bill Clinton (a high standard), he did the math on Romney's fiscal proposals\u2014and at the very least, left an impression in undecided voters' minds that it doesn't seem to add up. He linked Romney to George W. Bush. And in the single surest sign that he was dominating this debate, he prevented Romney from capitalizing on the administration's blundering response to the embassy attack in Benghazi.\n\nRomney's \"bounce\" from the first debate was evidence that a small-but-crucial segment of voters are willing to give both these candidates a hearing. The likely outcome, in the interval before next Monday's Round Three, is that many\u2014if not most\u2014will bounce back to the president. It won't be merely because Obama was as sharp this time as he was dull before; it will also be because Romney kept all his aggression from Denver, and none of his charm.\n\nJohn Avlon: Romney's missed opportunity\n\nPresident Obama needed a good debate last night and he got one.\n\nJohn Avlon\n\nMitt Romney followed a great first debate with a fail. His constant interruption of Candy Crowley and the president -- his peevish, \"Hall Monitor Mitt\" persona -- was not just a loss in terms of style points. It was revealing in terms of character. The CNN focus group found that the intense awkward interjections alienated swing voters and women in particular. Tweets to me used words like \"entitled\" and \"bully.\" Bottom line, it wasn't presidential. It was small and self-important rather than big and magnanimous. And it will cost him momentum.\n\nThe president started the debate hot rather than warm; he seemed almost too amped up. Romney did a better job relating to the audience as individuals at first. And then the insistent jockeying for time came, and the wheels started to come off his initially steady performance.\n\nThe Bengazi moment was also clarifying. Mitt Romney lost a major opportunity to press the president on a still-evolving issue of real vulnerability for this administration. President Obama's commitment to bring the killers to justice felt hollow one month after the attack. But when Romney accused the president of blithely hitting the campaign trail instead of focusing on the crisis, President Obama's response reflected real outrage at having matters of war and peace reduced to cheap political attacks. It was a defining moment.\n\nThe flip-flops came fast and furious, from new support for Pell Grants to the Dream Act, to name just a few. I'm looking forward to a full fact check list. I was surprised that more social issues questions, on choice and marriage equality, didn't get asked. Energy and immigration got their fill of time, and China bashing was a favorite topic, not coincidentally because it resonates particularly well in Ohio. President Obama also had a notable moment of unusual honesty for a politician, telling a questioner frankly \"some of these jobs aren't coming back.\"\n\nRomney's strongest suit in this campaign, his edge on questions of deficits and debt, came up rarely. The canned lines fell flat. And in Romney's closing statement, he suddenly chose to speak more frankly about his faith than at any time yet, showing a warmth that had been missing for most of the debate.\n\nPresident Obama chose his closing statement to offer an unexpected defense of American Individualism while getting in a dig at Romney's 47% statement. Overall, the performance was everything Obama failed to do in the first debate: engaged and energetic, balancing vision with stats. He still hasn't offered a clear second-term agenda, a persistent weakness of his campaign. But the personal and policy contrast was clear, and Obama came out on the winning side of this second debate.\n\nJohn Avlon is a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for Newsweek and The Daily Beast.

That became obvious when Gov. Mitt Romney crossed the line, politicized the deaths in Libya, and challenged the president's integrity. The president looked directly at Romney, and said with firm resolve \"that's not who I am.\" It will go down as one the great moments in American presidential debates.\n\nBut what about, \"are you on my side?\" Quick take: Romney hurt himself with women. It sounded like he only discovered the issue of equal pay at age 55, when he became governor -- and that his solution was to figure out a way for moms to get home in time to cook dinner. Romney's \"binders full of women\" comment is already blowing up online, and I expect we'll hear more about this over the next few days.\n\nOverall: The President of the United States was the President of the United States tonight. That will help him win a close election.\n\nVan Jones is president and founder of RebuildTheDream.com , an online platform for political innovation focused on policy, economics and media.

And it was feisty.\n\nBarack Obama was clearly the winner. He took command of the stage, respected the audience by giving them answers they could easily understand, and he did it with a smile.\n\nThe president came across as a thoughtful leader -- passionate, energetic, tough. Though it will be several days before anyone can fully digest the debate, some \"instant reaction\" is also permanently true: Barack Obama means what he says when he connects with the much-clich\u00e9d \"struggling middle class\" because he's lived that life.\n\nModerator Candy Crowley, like Martha Raddatz in the vice presidential debate, had a difficult job: Moderating these debates is like dealing with two guys arguing over the last beer when the Super Bowl's tied with a minute to go. But, as much as possible, she kept both men in their time limits and kept them within the framework of the question. She showed that moderators need to be journalists first, referees second.\n\nThe fact check on Benghazi will be replayed, but it was this response that showed Obama's true resolve and character as commander in chief: \"The suggestion that anybody on my team ... would play politics and mislead, when we've lost four of our own, governor, is offensive.\"\n\nObama won this debate as decisively as Romney won the first. He distinguished his plans from Romney's and did not let Romney run from his statements or positions. He took pride in his accomplishments, acknowledged the work yet to be done and spoke with compassion, consistency, focus and vision. He spoke as one who is and deserves to be president.\n\nI can't wait for Round 3.\n\nDonna Brazile , a CNN contributor and a Democratic strategist, is vice chairwoman for voter registration and participation at the Democratic National Committee.

The candidates -- during Tuesday night's debate and during almost every town-hall debate -- are eager to hit the talking points they've been rehearsing for days, to shift away from the audience's questions and pound directly at their opponent, to own the stage.\n\nBut there is something exceedingly worthwhile about an evening like Tuesday's: It is one of the few occasions when men like Barack Obama and Mitt Romney are told, in effect, by everyday Americans:\n\nHere's what I want to know. You're expected to answer me. If you don't, you may not get the job you want. Oh, and by the way: You have two minutes.\n\nFor one night, two of the most powerful people in the nation know that they would do well to remember the names of people who know the candidates' own names by heart. At the lofty level of society where men such as Obama and Romney have grown accustomed to living, they are the ones who always want the floor and can almost always count on having it. They're used to setting the clock, not obeying it.\n\nFor us to think that a night like Tuesday is humbling to them -- a night where, in plain sight, they must answer to people they don't know -- is probably unrealistic. Wednesday morning, they'll be back to calling their own shots.\n\nBut the format of a town-hall debate is inherently designed to remind two men at the heights what it is like to answer to people, just like the rest of the world has to do. Maybe whoever wins the presidency in three weeks will, from time to time, think about that feeling. If so, the town hall will have been a success.",
