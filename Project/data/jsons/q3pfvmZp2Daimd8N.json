Boehner and his top lieutenants after a series of self-inflicted legislative fumbles and political defeats in the first weeks of the congressional session .\nThis week \u2019 s retreat from the standoff over Homeland Security Department funding and President Obama \u2019 s deportation amnesty was only the latest embarrassment for Republican leaders , who also have had to yank bills on abortion , border security and education after rebellions within their own party .\nRep. Andy Harris , Maryland Republican , conceded that running the conference was like \u201c herding cats \u201d but said that is not an excuse for failure .\n\u201c I \u2019 m still optimistic that leadership can herd the cats . But if they can \u2019 t , then I think there will be consideration about whether a new leadership team needs to be put in place , \u201d Mr. Harris said .\nThe leaders have acknowledged stumbles at the opening of the congressional session , when Republicans took control of the Senate as well as the House and members had high expectations for advancing a conservative agenda . But leaders have insisted that they don \u2019 t need dramatic changes in how they run the conference , a Republican aide said .\nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy , California Republican , prides himself on having an open-door policy and listening to members , but conservative lawmakers say the leadership team hasn \u2019 t been listening to them or their constituents .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think they are listening to all the members , \u201d said Rep.

Tom Cole , an Oklahoma Republican who is a close ally of Mr. Boehner .\n\u201c We have a group of people who , frankly , think they are always right and their leaders and the conference collectively are usually wrong , \u201d he said . \u201c It \u2019 s actually a fairly small group . \u201d\nRep. Peter T. King , New York Republican , put it more bluntly : \u201c I don \u2019 t consider them conservatives .

But I don \u2019 t know if that group of about 35 wants to be organized . It \u2019 s almost as if they sit by themselves in the floor there \u2014 like a separate party , like in France or Italy where you have the rump parties out there , \u201d Mr. King said .\nNot all of the leadership \u2019 s dust-ups have been with conservatives .\nThe first blunder occurred with a bill that would ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy , with an exception for cases of reported rape , incest or danger to the mother \u2019 s life . The leaders pulled the bill Jan. 21 to head off a revolt by some of the conference \u2019 s female and moderate members .\n\u201c We \u2019 re continuing to listen to everybody , \u201d Mr. McCarthy said at the time . \u201c We \u2019 re still planning on moving forward with the bill . \u201d\nA week later , a border security bill was pulled amid complaints from conservatives that it was too weak . The legislation is expected to return combined with other bills that beef up interior enforcement of immigration laws .\nThe third bill pulled off the floor would have rolled back parts of the No Child Left Behind Act , but conservatives balked that it didn \u2019 t do enough to get the federal government out of education .\nMr. Fleming said the education bill underscored the disconnect between Republican congressional leaders and voters .\n\u201c That \u2019 s the reason why there is frustration out there , \u201d he said . \u201c Time and time again , our constituents are telling us , \u2018 No , we don \u2019 t want federal mandating on school education .
