At the Constitutional Convention , James Madison objected to including \u201c maladministration \u201d \u2014poor governance\u2014among the causes of impeachment because , he said , that would amount to the president serving at the pleasure of the Senate .

That \u2019 s a high hurdle , but Trump \u2019 s support among Republican senators has always been guarded , not to say grudging . Indeed , just count the GOP senators whom the president has publicly insulted or gotten crosswise with at some point and you have nearly half the GOP votes needed for removal . In that sense , Trump is potentially more vulnerable to impeachment and removal than most presidents would be , which should reduce the burden for Democrats .\nAnd yet the Democrats have failed to carry even this reduced burden .
