    "content": "Police fired smoke and tear gas canisters early Sunday in an effort to disperse several dozen protesters who defied a curfew in a St. Louis suburb where a black teenager was fatally shot by a white police officer last week .\nThe Missouri Highway Patrol said that seven people were arrested and one man had been shot at the site of the protest in Ferguson , Mo . Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt . Ron Johnson said that the shooting victim was in critical condition and had been rushed to a hospital by protesters .\nJohnson said the use of tear gas was precipitated by concerns about people who 'd broken into a barbecue restaurant and taken position on the roof overlooking approaching police . Another concern involved a man flashing a handgun who appeared in the middle of the street as armored vehicles approached . Johnson says someone fired at a patrol car , but no officers were injured .\n`` I was disappointed in the actions of tonight , '' Johnson said .\nThe St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that St. Louis Alderman Antonio French , who has taken part in demonstrations all week , told reporters that the police 's tactics `` were a lot better '' than they could have been . French also said that he had attempted to convince people to honor the curfew , but some `` did n't want to be told to leave . ''\nFrench later tweeted , `` I can tell you firsthand that some of the people that remained tonight were armed . Were ready for a fight . And wanted to injure police . ''\nHundreds of other protesters had left peacefully before the midnight-to-5 a.m. curfew took effect , but remaining protesters -- chanting `` No justice ! No curfew ! '' -- refused to leave the area .\nAs five armored tactical vehicles approached the crowd , officers spoke through a loudspeaker : `` You are in violation of a state-imposed curfew . You must disperse immediately . Failure to comply may result in arrest . ''\nHighway Patrol Spokesman Lt. John Hotz initially said police only used smoke , but later told The Associated Press that they also fired tear gas canisters . He said of police efforts : `` Obviously , we 're trying to give them every opportunity to comply with the curfew .

Protesters said their faces and eyes had been burned . Others screamed in pain .\nJayson Ross , who was leading the protesters toward police , said : `` They got guns . We got guns . We are ready . ''\nThe curfew had been announced by Missouri Gov . Jay Nixon Saturday afternoon in an effort to prevent the violence and looting that had marred earlier protests over the August 9 death of 18-year-old Michael Brown . The governor also declared a state of emergency .\nEarly Sunday , Johnson said that authorities were not aware of any looting that had occurred during the night .\nStormy weather and the urgings of protest leaders made the decision to go home before midnight easier for some . As midnight approached late Saturday , New Black Panther Party leader Malik Shabazz roamed the street with a bullhorn , encouraging people to leave for their own safety .\n`` C'mon you all , let 's roll out , '' Shabazz said through his bullhorn . `` Let 's roll out of here , get some rest and come back tomorrow .
