    "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , in a dramatic and highly public showdown with a U.S. president , told a joint session of Congress Tuesday that an emerging diplomatic agreement with Iran would not only fail to stop Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons , but virtually ensure it gets them .\n\u201c This is a bad deal . It \u2019 s a very bad deal . We \u2019 re better off without it , \u201d Mr. Netanyahu said in a 40-minute address that drew repeated standing ovations in a House chamber packed mostly with Republican lawmakers .\nPresident Barack Obama , in remarks from the Oval Office a short time later , accused Mr. Netanyahu of sounding an alarm on a deal that isn \u2019 t final while failing to offer \u201c any viable alternatives \u201d to the current negotiations involving the U.S. , U.K. , France , Germany , Russia and China . Those talks began two years ago after Mr. Obama personally launched an initiative to engage Iran despite 34 years of frozen ties .\nConcern for the potential unraveling of Washington \u2019 s long tradition of bipartisan support for Israel was at least one area where Messrs. Obama and Netanyahu agreed .\nStill , the divisions between the two , playing out so publicly on opposite ends of Pennsylvania Avenue , underscore how severely strained relations between Israel and the U.S. have grown . The increasingly partisan overtone was demonstrated when about 50 Democrats boycotted Mr. Netanyahu \u2019 s speech because it was organized by Republican leaders of the new GOP-controlled Congress without consultation with the White House .\nMr. Netanyahu , who flew back to Israel where he faces an election in two weeks , left in his wake a growing battle between Congress and the White House over Iran nuclear talks , which continue this week in Geneva ahead of an end-of-March deadline .\nMr. Obama said he didn \u2019 t watch Mr. Netanyahu \u2019 s speech but read the transcript . He urged Congress to reserve judgment on a deal until one is reached .\n\u201c The alternative that the prime minister offers is no deal , \u201d Mr. Obama said , \u201c in which case Iran will immediately begin , once again , pursuing its nuclear program , accelerating its nuclear program , without us having any insight into what they \u2019 re doing and without restraint . \u201d\nMr. Obama promised to make his case to Congress if there is a final deal and said it would be \u201c a great mistake \u201d to derail talks now .\n\u201c Let \u2019 s wait until there \u2019 s actually a deal on the table that Iran has agreed to , at which point everybody can evaluate it , \u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201c And what I can guarantee is if it is a deal I signed off on , I will be able to prove that it is the best way for us to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon . \u201d\nMr. Netanyahu is counting on Congress to intervene on the path the Obama administration is taking in the negotiations . Senate Republican leaders responded later Tuesday by moving forward on legislation that would impose congressional authority to review any final deal .\nLawmakers also could pass new sanctions on Iran while talks are ongoing , which they have signaled they may do after a late March deadline in the talks . Mr. Obama has said he would veto any additional sanctions .\nMr. Netanyahu directly challenged Mr. Obama \u2019 s argument that a diplomatic accord allowing Tehran to retain some nuclear capabilities would be more effective than additional sanctions or military action .\nHe said any agreement that stops short of completely dismantling Iran \u2019 s nuclear program\u2014which Tehran has said is for peaceful purposes\u2014would be ineffective .\nFollowing Mr. Netanyahu \u2019 s appearance , Iran \u2019 s Foreign Ministry dismissed the address as repetitive and deceitful in its description of Iran \u2019 s intentions .\nIRNA , the state news agency , quoted ministry spokeswoman Marzieh Afkham as saying the mixed reception for Mr. Netanyahu in Washington was a symbol of his isolation , \u201c even among those who supported the Zionist regime . \u201d\nThe public upbraiding of Mr. Obama \u2019 s negotiations carries tremendous risks for the Israeli leader and his country as he seeks re-election in two weeks , American and Israeli officials said . Any apparent fraying of U.S. support for the Jewish state could unnerve Israeli voters .\n\u201c Israel must remain a bipartisan issue among our long-standing American friends , and it is unfortunate that the prime minister helped to stir rough political waters in Washington , \u201d said Israeli Labor Party member Erel Margalit , a top opposition figure , on Monday in Washington .\nIsaac Herzog , Mr. Netanyahu \u2019 s main leftist challenger in Israeli elections this month , reiterated accusations that the speech would backfire on Israel and cause damage to Israel \u2019 s ties with the U.S .\nThe mano-a-mano between Messrs. Netanyahu and Obama showed little space for agreement .\nMr. Netanyahu called on the U.S. to use the nuclear talks as leverage to force Iran to change its behavior , such as including provisions requiring the Iranian regime to stop supporting terrorism and threatening Israel . \u201c Iran has proven time and again that it can not be trusted , \u201d he said .\nSuch a move would expand the scope of the international nuclear talks . Mr. Obama rejected Mr. Netanyahu \u2019 s idea , stressing the importance that the negotiations remain focused solely on Iran \u2019 s nuclear program .\nObama administration officials have long said nuclear talks aren \u2019 t aimed at a broader rapprochement with Iran .\n\u201c The specific problem that is being debated right now is not whether we trust the Iranian regime or not\u2014we don \u2019 t trust them , \u201d Mr. Obama said .\nMr. Netanyahu objected to any deal that would leave Iran with significant uranium enrichment capacity , or within 10 years of being able to resume a broader nuclear program . Mr. Obama said this week that a final deal is likely to include a time frame of at least 10 years .\nMr. Netanyahu said lifting economic sanctions would embolden Tehran to \u201c sponsor even more terrorism \u201d and the emerging nuclear agreement would set off a nuclear arms race in the Middle East .\nMr. Obama pointedly noted that Mr. Netanyahu had opposed an interim nuclear agreement adopted in 2013 , which he said has kept Iran from progressing toward a nuclear weapon and of which Mr. Netanyahu supported an extension .\nSome Democrats were disappointed with Mr. Netanyahu \u2019 s overall tone , but others agreed with some of his points .
