    "content": "The Pentagon on Wednesday made the sobering prediction that more towns in Syria and Iraq will fall to the Islamic State in the coming weeks , and that air power alone is not going to be enough to prevent the fall of the Syrian city of Kobani near the Turkish border .\nIt also raised the prospect of Islamic State terrorists marching on Baghdad , a fear that lawmakers and former top military officials say can only be addressed by ground forces .\n\u201c We know that [ the Islamic State ] is going to continue to grab ground , and there are going to continue to be villages and towns and cities that they take , \u201d said Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby , press secretary to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel . \u201c We all have to recognize that reality . \u201d\nSpeaking specifically about cities in western Iraq , he said , \u201c There are places where [ the Islamic State ] continues to make gains in Iraq . We talked about Hit . We talked about Ramadi . We talked about Fallujah , which is still in contention right now . That \u2019 s worrisome , because it \u2019 s close to Baghdad . \u201d\nThe assessment came before President Obama met with his top military officers and National Security Council at the Pentagon . Mr. Obama emerged to tout his confidence in the progress that coalition efforts are making . He made no note of increasing calls for sending U.S. ground forces , and instead addressed the need to better train and arm Syrian opposition groups that the U.S. hopes will fight the terrorists on the ground .\n\u201c This is not something that can be solved overnight , \u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201c Our strikes continue , alongside our partners . \u201d\nOn Wednesday , the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee said the president \u2019 s war strategy in Iraq is failing .\nRep. Howard P. \u201c Buck \u201d McKeon , California Republican , said Mr. Obama needs to consider new options \u2014 including American ground troops \u2014 for the air war-only strategy .\n\u201c Evidence is mounting that an \u2018 Iraq first \u2019 approach focused on airstrikes isn \u2019 t degrading ISIL , \u201d said Mr. McKeon , using one of the Islamic State \u2019 s acronyms , which is also known as ISIS . \u201c From Kobani to Baghdad , they are using their Syrian sanctuary to make gains . The president needs to adopt a broader strategy if we are to protect our interests . He needs to walk out of the Pentagon willing to put new options on the table rather than continuing to rule them out . \u201d\nFor more than a month , Mr. McKeon has advocated putting a relatively small number of U.S. ground troops into the battle to aid the beleaguered Iraqi Security Forces . Iraqi troops retreated en masse in June when the Islamic State invaded from Syria and gobbled up terrain .\nThe \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported Monday that the Islamic State today holds about the same number of towns in Iraq as it did two months ago , when the U.S. began a bombing campaign to whittle down the terrorist army and support Iraqi ground troops trying to retake territory .\nMore troubling , analysts say , is that the Islamic State apparently is preparing operations designed to one day invade Baghdad .\nIts objective is to take the international airport and begin conquering the capital , section by section . The Islamic State is continuing its urban attacks with car bombs , some of which have been detonated by foreign suicide bombers .\nMuch press coverage on the war has focused in recent days on Kobani , where Kurdish fighters are in fierce street battles with Islamic State fighters as U.S. planes drop a smattering of bombs .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t have a willing , capable , effective partner on the ground inside Syria on the ground , \u201d said Adm. Kirby . \u201c It \u2019 s just a fact . I can \u2019 t change that . \u201d\nThe U.S. strategy for \u201c degrading and ultimately destroy [ ing ] \u201d the Islamic State hinges on forming a new 5,000-strong Syrian fighting force in Saudi Arabia and then inserting it next spring inside Syria to fight the terrorist army . The Obama administration hopes this force , and continued airstrikes , will then evict the Islamic State town by town .\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest echoed the Pentagon \u2019 s warning on Kobani \u2014 from where more than 160,000 Syrians have fled \u2014 and other towns .\n\u201c That will limit the effectiveness of the United States military on the situation in Kobani , \u201d Mr . Earnest said . \u201c That sort of ground operation doesn \u2019 t currently exist in Syria right now . We should just be forthright about the limitations in this particular situation . \u201d\nThe president has vowed not to send U.S. combat ground troops into the fight against the Islamic State .\nOn Wednesday , U.S. airstrikes appeared to slow the Islamic State \u2019 s advance on Kobani , where Kurdish fighters have held off the militants during a three-week siege .\nWith the Islamic State closing in on the border , Turkey \u2014 a NATO ally \u2014 has refused to engage in combat against the militants , saying it needs assurances that the U.S.-led coalition of Western and Arab nations is committed to a long-term struggle . Turkey has fought off a Kurdish insurgency in southern regions since the 1980s .\nOn Thursday , NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg , as well as Mr. Obama \u2019 s two envoys to the anti-Islamic State coalition \u2014 retired Gen. John Allen and Ambassador Brett McGurk \u2014 arrive for talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to push for greater Turkish action , The Associated Press reported .\nMeanwhile , the Islamic State is not just advancing in Syria . After two months of U.S. bombing , the Sunni extremist army still holds as many , or more , towns than it did on Aug. 8 .\nLast week , it claimed a new city , Hit , in Iraq \u2019 s western Anbar province , a Sunni stronghold and gateway for possible attacks on the international airport and Baghdad .\nThe Obama administration is playing a waiting game . It has inserted special operations forces , not to fight but to help reorganize and train the reborn Iraqi Security Forces ( ISF ) . As of now , it has not mounted anything close to a concerted counteroffensive .\nRetired Army Lt. Gen. James Dubik , who led the effort to train and expand the ISF during the 2007 troop surge , said Iraq must go on the offensive soon .\n\u201c The longer we wait to get the ISF going on the ground portion of the counteroffensive , the more ISIS will adapt to air attack and find ways to keep the ISF occupied , and the harder it will be , psychologically , to get the ISF to transition to the offensive , \u201d said Mr. Dubik , an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War . \u201c Time is not on our side . \u201d\nHe said the first phase can have \u201c modest objectives , \u201d such as targeting Islamic State leaders and taking back a few small towns .\n\u201c The ISF need a few important enough wins to move their psychology from \u2018 we \u2019 re under siege \u2019 to \u2018 we \u2019 re on the move , \u2019 \u201d he said .",
