In spite of that , the world 's largest historic emitter , the United States , is leaving the Paris Agreement .\nMeanwhile , it remains to be seen whether a climate pact that relies on voluntary national commitments \u2014 as the deal of nearly 200 countries reached outside Paris in 2015 is designed to do \u2014 can deliver the needed results .\nThe next moment of truth comes next year in Glasgow , when countries are asked to strengthen the pledges \u2014 known in Paris parlance as nationally determined contributions , or NDCs . If enough countries step forward to increase their commitment in a way that begins to close the gap on the Paris goal of keeping warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius , that will boost confidence in the agreement , experts say . If not , faith in the deal will falter .\n`` Next year really is a critical test for what countries are prepared to do to put the world on a trajectory to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement , '' said David Waskow , director of the international climate program at the World Resources Institute .\nMadrid `` in many respects can be seen as a marker on that path , as a steppingstone to what needs to be achieved next year , '' he added .\nHere 's what 's at stake for the next two weeks in Madrid .\nLast year 's round of U.N. climate talks in Katowice , Poland , closed negotiations on most aspects of how the pact will operate \u2014 a set of procedures known as the Paris rulebook .\nBut talks stumbled on one issue \u2014 how international carbon trading markets should operate to make emission reductions less expensive under the deal without undermining their integrity .\nThis year 's talks will center on two issues : whether carbon credits can be counted effectively toward two countries ' NDCs at the same time and whether projects undertaken before 2020 can be counted toward Paris \u2014 which effectively begins next year .\nBrazil took the lead last year in insisting that countries that , like it , produce carbon offsets should be allowed to sell those to foreign buyers while still counting those reductions toward their own NDCs . The South American giant also wants projects it undertook under the Clean Development Mechanism , or CDM , of the Kyoto Protocol to retain their value under Paris even though the protocol will effectively end this year .\nThe Chilean presidency of this year 's conference of the parties , or COP , wants to make progress toward resolving the issues . But environmentalists warned of the risk of agreeing to a set of rules that creates loopholes that would allow corporations and companies to claim reductions they 're not making .\n`` Obviously , having bad rules in place could be disastrous in terms of environmental integrity by allowing a lot of non-additional transactions into the market and letting countries off the hook to do as much as they need to do to meet their Paris commitments , '' said Alden Meyer , director of strategy and policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists .\nMeyer noted that if negotiators do n't finish work on what is known as Article 6 of the Paris Agreement , countries may go ahead and link their trading on an ad hoc basis .\n`` It would be sort of a Wild West scenario where it 's left up to each country or group of countries how they 're going to proceed , '' he said .\nThis is the last major thing the U.N .
