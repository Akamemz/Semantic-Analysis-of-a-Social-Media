    "content": "Super Tuesday was very good to Joe Biden . Roughly one-third of Democrats nationwide cast their ballots for president in the first big primary election of the year , although not all of those ballots have yet been counted . Accordingly , we won \u2019 t be unfreezing our primary forecast until we have a clearer picture of the exact results . But we can confidently say that , whenever it bleeps and bloops back to life , the forecast will show Biden on the rise . Not only did he win the states he was expected to win on Tuesday , but he proved his cross-sectional appeal by notching a few wins on what was supposed to be Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2019 s turf .\nHeading into yesterday , it looked like Super Tuesday was going to break down along regional lines , with Biden winning the Southern states and Sanders winning those in the North and West . Biden certainly held up his end of the bargain : Our model gave Biden a 2 in 3 chance or better of winning the six Southern states of Alabama , Arkansas , North Carolina , Oklahoma , Tennessee and Virginia \u2014 and he carried all six by double digits . In fact , he exceeded our already-lofty expectations in these states . For example , our average forecast in Virginia put Biden at 43 percent of the vote and Sanders at 23 percent ; Biden got 53 percent in real life and Sanders 23 percent . And in Alabama , we forecasted that Biden would beat Sanders 44 percent to 21 percent , on average ; the final results were Biden 63 percent , Sanders 17 percent .\nCrucially , Biden also won Texas in a close race ; ABC News finally called the state at 2 a.m. Eastern as Biden held a 33-percent-to-29-percent lead over Sanders . Texas was the most up-in-the-air state in our forecast , so it was always going to be a bellwether for who was having a good night on Tuesday . Of course , the fact that it is worth the second-most delegates of any state doesn \u2019 t hurt either .\nBut Biden \u2019 s most impressive wins came in Massachusetts and Minnesota , where Sanders entered Super Tuesday as a slight favorite \u2014 and Biden wasn \u2019 t even the most likely candidate to upset him . Per our forecast , Biden had only a 1 in 5 chance of carrying each state , and yet he won Massachusetts by 7 points and Minnesota by a daunting 9 . Both wins showed Biden \u2019 s ability to expand his coalition outside his usual comfort zone . Minnesota is a state that has relatively few voters of color ( a key part of Biden \u2019 s base ) and that Sanders won by 23 points in 2016 . But the last-minute endorsement of Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar , who dropped out of the race to support Biden , was apparently very influential . And in Massachusetts , Biden effectively kneecapped home-state Sen. Elizabeth Warren by usurping her former base of college-educated whites ; Biden carried the upper-class suburbs that ring Boston .\nSo far , the only states that Sanders is projected or likely to win are three Western states \u2014 California , Colorado and Utah \u2014 plus Vermont . Sanders was never in danger of losing his home state ( he had a greater than 99 percent chance to win Vermont , according to our forecast ) , and he may have been saved in the West by the fact that all three states vote primarily by mail ( and therefore cast many of their ballots before this week , when Biden experienced a surge of endorsements and popular support ) . According to exit polls , voters who made up their mind on whom to vote for within the last few days broke heavily for Biden . And even in states like North Carolina , Biden did merely OK among early voters but cleaned up among Election Day voters .\nFinally , there are a couple states where we still don \u2019 t have conclusive results . As of Wednesday morning , Maine was still too close to call , although that in and of itself is a win for Biden ; we gave him only a 1 in 4 chance of carrying the state entering the night . And although some outlets ( though not our colleagues at ABC News ) have called California for Sanders , the results there are still very preliminary , since mail-in ballots can arrive as late as Friday and still be counted .
