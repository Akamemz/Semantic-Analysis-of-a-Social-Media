A new report from the Pew Research Center shows that the percentage of Americans who say they believe in God, pray daily and attend church regularly is declining.\n\nAmong the findings:\n\nThe share of Americans who say they are \"absolutely certain\" that God exists has dropped 8 percentage points, from 71 percent to 63 percent, since 2007, when the last comparable study was made.\n\nThe percentage of adults who describe themselves as \"religiously affiliated\" has shrunk 6 points since 2007, from 83 percent to 77 percent.\n\nThe shares of the U.S. adult population who consider religion \"very important\" to them, pray daily and attend services at least once a month have declined between 3 and 4 percentage points over the past eight years.\n\nThe shift is small but statistically significant, according to the authors, given that the changes have taken place in a relatively short period of time, and the survey sample is large enough (about 35,000 U.S. adults) to be considered reliable.\n\nSkepticism about religion is especially evident among young people. The Pew study found that barely a quarter of \"millennials\" (born between 1981 and 1996) attend church services on a weekly basis, compared with more than half of U.S. adults born before 1946. Only about 4 in 10 millennials say religion is important in their lives, compared with more than half of those who are older, including two-thirds of those born before 1946.\n\nThe Pew researchers acknowledge that some young people may become more religious as they grow older, but their data suggest that the generational differences in religiosity could well endure. \"The oldest Millennials, now in their late 20s and early 30s, are generally less observant than they were seven years ago,\" the authors write. \"If these trends continue American society is likely to grow less religious even if those who are adults today maintain their current levels of religious commitment.\"\n\nThe weakening of religious beliefs and practices has clear political overtones.
