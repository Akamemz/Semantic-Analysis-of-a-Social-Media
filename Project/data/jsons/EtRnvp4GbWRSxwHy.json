Trump , many in the GOP \u2019 s upper ranks are convinced , would lead the Republican Party to an epic defeat in November , with consequences all the way down the ballot .\n\u201c This whole thing is a disaster , \u201d said Curt Anderson , a former Republican National Committee political director and veteran operative . \u201c I think I \u2019 ll write a book about it . \u201d\nReceiving much of the blame is Right to Rise , the cash-flush super PAC that broke records when it announced last year that it had raised more than $ 100 million in support of Jeb Bush . The group has directed relatively little of that sum toward attacking Trump \u2014 instead focusing its efforts on taking down Bush \u2019 s establishment rivals , above all Marco Rubio . To date , the group has spent about $ 5 million on TV commercials going after Trump , while dropping four times as much in negative ads against Rubio . The latest spot , which came Tuesday , hammered Rubio over his messy financial history .\nRight to Rise , with its nearly limitless resources , had the best chance to wage a concerted campaign to take down the real estate mogul , many are convinced \u2014 and they blame Mike Murphy , the group \u2019 s chief strategist , for missing the opportunity .

Of the $ 33 million that Rubio and the super PACs supporting him have spent on television ads , none of it has been against Trump .
