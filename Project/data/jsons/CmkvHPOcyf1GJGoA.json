( With the possible exception of the Village People 's `` Y.M.C.A . '' video , which I say still holds up . )\nDemocrats are gung-ho about deploying the U.S. military provided only that it will harm the national security interests of the United States , but vehemently oppose interventions that serve American interests .\nRepublican President Dwight Eisenhower , the supreme commander of the Allied forces in World War II , said he could conceive of no greater tragedy than the U.S. getting heavily involved in Vietnam . He sent aid to the anti-communist forces , but no troops .\nDemocratic President John F. Kennedy sent troops . But in short order he was conniving to assassinate South Vietnamese president Ngo Dinh Diem -- also known as `` our ally in the middle of the war . ''\nJFK 's brother , the Democratic attorney general , actually suggested that Americans donate blood to the North Vietnamese -- or `` our enemy '' -- as a gesture of good will . ( Secretary of State John Kerry 's bold threat this week of an `` unbelievably small '' strike against Syria sounds positively macho by comparison . )\nKennedy 's successor , Lyndon B. Johnson , escalated the war in Vietnam in order to prove that Democrats could be trusted with national defense . Which they can not . As journalist David Halberstam reported , LBJ would `` talk to his closest political aides about the McCarthy days , of how Truman lost China and then the Congress and the White House , and how , by God , Johnson was not going to be the president who lost Vietnam and the Congress and the White House .

In return for the lousy terms we jammed down South Vietnam 's throat , America promised that , if the North attacked , the U.S. would resume bombing missions and military aid .\nAmerica had n't been humiliated -- the left had to act fast ! The media invented Watergate , Nixon was forced to resign and a crazily left-wing Congress was inaugurated . Just a month later , North Vietnam attacked the South , and the Democratic Congress turned its back on South Vietnam , betrayed an ally and trashed America 's word . ( For Democrats , that 's a `` victory . '' )\nIn 1953 , President Eisenhower assisted the Shah of Iran in removing loon Mohammad Mossadegh as prime minister . Mossadegh had been elected in the confusion after the assassination of the previous prime minister , whereupon he promptly nationalized Iran 's oil fields , driving out the British companies who knew how to run them , thus wiping out Iran 's primary source of wealth . With British and American help , the shah 's choice was installed as prime minister , and a friendly government ruled Iran .\nAlas , 20 years later , Jimmy Carter became president . When Islamic fundamentalists staged a revolution in Iran , Carter refused to come to the aid of the shah , a staunch American ally . Liberals praised Ayatollah Khomeini to the skies -- Carter 's U.N. ambassador Andrew Young , Princeton 's Richard Falk and LBJ attorney general Ramsey Clark all assured us that life would be peachy under him . What could go wrong ?\nThe ayatollah had barely seized power when Islamic lunatics took 52 Americans hostage in Tehran , where they remained for 444 days , until Carter was safely removed from office .\nBy giving Islamic fanatics their first nation-state , Carter produced the global Islamofacist movement we 're still dealing with today .\nFor the next eight years , peace and freedom spread throughout the world as President Ronald Reagan destroyed the Soviet Union and restored America 's power . Liberals wailed and stamped their feet throughout this period .\nIn the face of mass starvation in Somalia , President George H.W . Bush sent troops to ensure that aid could get into the country . President Clinton came in and decided to convert this simple relief effort into an exercise in `` nation-building . '' In Somalia . Great idea .\nIn short order , the Muslim rebels killed some of our troops and dragged their corpses through the streets . Clinton instantly withdrew our entire military operation .

In response , President George W. Bush invaded Afghanistan and wiped out the Taliban and al-Qaida strongholds in a few months . Bush left a limited force behind to prevent a return of the terrorist training camps .\nMost crucially , President Bush removed a monstrous dictator from Iraq and established the only Islamic democracy in the Middle East . Iraq 's Saddam Hussein had aided and sheltered terrorists , attempted to assassinate a former president of the United States , and horribly brutalized his own people , murdering a million of them , according to The New York Times -- including with chemical weapons , far worse than anything Syrian president Bashar Assad is accused of doing .\nIraq became a beacon of hope for all Muslims still living under despotic regimes .\nFor absolutely no reason , with no objective and no concept of `` victory , '' Barack Obama came into office and massively escalated the number of troops in Afghanistan . When Bush left office , there had been only about 625 U.S. troop fatalities in the entire course of the Afghanistan War . Obama has quadrupled that to nearly 2,300 troop deaths today .\nFor no purpose whatsoever -- no purpose , that is , other than fulfilling Obama 's idiotic campaign talking point about Afghanistan being a `` war of necessity , '' contrasted with Iraq , a potty little `` war of convenience . '' ( At least Obama 's `` credibility '' on Afghanistan is still intact ! )\nThen Obama threw away our victory in Iraq . By withdrawing every last troop , Obama has allowed al-Qaida and Iran to overrun this one shining example of an Arab democracy .

But no troops for you , Iraq !\nObama did n't even have to do anything in Iraq ! He only had to not remove all our troops .\nInstead , Obama flung America 's prestige into removing the pro-Western Hosni Mubarak in Egypt .
