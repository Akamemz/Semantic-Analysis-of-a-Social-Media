Cesar Chavez plaza during a recent protest , when people who had begun to march out of the plaza \u2014 came running right back . They were fleeing from tear gas that had been fired at them by the Sacramento police . Boykin , who has been a social justice advocate longer than she has worked in the emergency department at Sacramento \u2019 s UC Davis Medical Center , soon found herself overcome by tear gas , as well .\n\u201c I think hyper awareness that our lives are literally on the line definitely drew people into the streets , \u201d Boykin said of protesters standing up for an end to police violence \u2014 only to be subjected to police violence themselves . As a protest medic , Boykin said she has seen everything from a protester \u2019 s skull fractured by a police projectile , to abrasions on protesters who have fallen down , while running to avoid being shot or gassed .\nNational Nurses United ( NNU ) is the largest union of registered nurses in the country , representing Boykin and 150,000 other nurses , and these protesters are our patients . It \u2019 s our duty to advocate for their health safety , and that means standing up for racial justice and saying , \u201c Enough ! \u201d to the weapons of war used on people protesting the police violence that has killed George Floyd , Breonna Taylor , and countless others .\nTake tear gas , for example . This chemical weapon has proven fatal in documented cases and is banned in actual warfare , yet it is used liberally by police departments across the country on protesters . It can cause symptoms including vomiting , blurred vision , shortness of breath , tearing , difficulty swallowing , temporary blindness , pain \u2014 and coughing and sneezing . I \u2019 ll say that again for those in the back : It can cause coughing and sneezing during a pandemic when it \u2019 s critical not to spread the virus causing COVID-19 .\nIn addition , to tear gas , militarized police across the country have shown up to recent protests for racial justice and an end to police violence with flashbangs ( also known as stun grenades ) . These weapons have heat exceeding 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit and a blast of 175 decibels and can cause burns , hearing loss , temporary blindness , injuries from shrapnel , and death . Police have also fired rubber bullets , which often have a metal core , and are responsible for deaths , often from the head , neck , and torso trauma \u2014 and internal bleeding , organ damage , and bruising .\nThis is all not to mention other forms of police violence , including kicking , pushing , beating , and kettling protesters , leaving them with no way to escape police violence .\nNurses have seen these violent police tactics before , including during deployments of NNU \u2019 s Registered Nurse Response Network ( RNRN ) to Occupy Wall Street , to Standing Rock , and to the U.S.-Mexico border . At Standing Rock in 2016 , nurses met water protector Vanessa Dundon , whose eye was shot out by a tear gas canister fired by police \u2014 just as Brandon Saenz \u2019 s eye was recently shot out with \u201c less lethal ammunition \u201d at a May 30 Dallas protest , and freelance photographer Linda Tirado \u2019 s eye was shot out by a foam bullet at a May 29 Minneapolis protest .\nAs we connect the lines , nurses can see that police violence against protesters spans calendar years , locations , and protest issues ; it is ubiquitous .
