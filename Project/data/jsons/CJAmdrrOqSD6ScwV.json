Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLast week, Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski announced that they would vote against Donald Trump\u2019s extremely controversial pick for secretary of education, Betsy DeVos. This rallied the left and put Democrats in a pretty exciting position: in need of just one more Republican vote against DeVos to bring her down. That vote, however, is proving very hard to wrangle.\n\n\n\nAs we speak, Senate Democrats are in the midst of a \u201ctalk-a-thon\u201d against DeVos. They\u2019ve held the Senate floor since it opened at noon and intend to hold it, with a few interruptions, until DeVos\u2019 vote midday Tuesday. One Senate Democrat after another, going well into the night, will deliver a speech about why he or she thinks DeVos would make a rotten education secretary, in order to sway the one additional Republican senator they need to vote her down.\n\nBut who would that senator be?\n\nConstituents making their voices heard against DeVos are far more likely to persuade a Republican senator than even the most persuasive speech from a Democratic senator. Murkowski cited constituent feedback as critical in determining her position. And since Murkowski and Collins came out against DeVos last week, the Capitol Hill phone system has been melting with constituent heat for undecided Republican senators.\n\nNone of them has budged.
