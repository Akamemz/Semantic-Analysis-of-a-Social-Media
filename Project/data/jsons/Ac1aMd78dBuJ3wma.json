    "content": "Melinda Gates is the co-founder and co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation , the largest private foundation in the United States . With more than $ 40 billion in assets , the Gates Foundation works on a dizzying array of issues , from eradicating polio to feeding the world to treating HIV to stopping climate change to reforming the US education system .\nGates has also been working , in recent years , on increasing diversity in the technology industry . \u201c If you [ only ] have products created by white guys in their 20s , you \u2019 re gon na miss the mark , \u201d she says .\nI sat down with Gates at South by Southwest for an interview that covered a lot of ground . We talked , among other things , about bioterrorism , climate change , the culture of Silicon Valley , the Damore memo about gender and technology , the future of food , the problems money can and can \u2019 t solve , what makes America culturally distinct , and more . You can listen to the whole interview on my podcast , The Ezra Klein Show . A transcript , edited for length and clarity , follows .\nYou made a comment about the need for diversity in technology that I wanted to hear you expand on . You said , \u201c Who \u2019 s going to be taking care of our elderly two generations from now ? It \u2019 s going to be AI . But do you want all males in their early 20s and 30s creating the AI that \u2019 s gon na take care of you when you \u2019 re older ? \u201d\nWhat would happen if that AI was created by all males in their 20s and 30s ?\nI don \u2019 t think they \u2019 d fully understand the needs of older people . You have to spend time in that community to understand what their needs are . I think you would miss a big part of the empathy gene .\nThe way you treat a young child versus an 18-year-old , 22-year-old , 30-year-old , versus an elderly person , is pretty different .

It \u2019 s a horrible thing when you start to lose a little bit of your sight , or you can \u2019 t drive anymore , and that was your rite of passage when you were younger . I think if you have these products that are created by white guys in their 20s , you \u2019 re just gon na miss the mark on both empathy and the actual needs of the elderly and what they \u2019 re facing .\nThe counterargument you hear to this is \u201c Well , what we want to do , above all , is hire the best people. \u201d That feels to me like the real point of friction right now , this question of whether diversity is something people are prioritizing because they \u2019 re politically correct or because it is something they need to build the best products .\nThey \u2019 re leaving opportunities off the table . There \u2019 s good research now that shows your products are better , you \u2019 re gon na reach more markets , if you have diversity at the table . Think of the way women use certain tools online versus men . They \u2019 re often very , very different .\nHere \u2019 s a great example . There was an idea to connect people to nannies and babysitters that came from a female founder . She ran it across Sand Hill Road [ where the big venture capital firms are ] , and nobody understood it . Here \u2019 s another one that \u2019 s actually been extraordinarily successful that Ben Horowitz has invested in : hair weaves for black women . It \u2019 s an enormous market . When that founder went and ran it across Sand Hill Road , the guys totally didn \u2019 t get it . Ben Horowitz did , and he invested in it . Guess where he grew up ? He went to Berkeley , has an African-American wife .\nWhen you think about the changing demographics we \u2019 re seeing in this nation , when you think about the workforce today and dual-income families now , it \u2019 s completely different than when I grew up back in the 1960s . By 2044 , what we call minorities today in our country , when you add them all up , they will be the majority . If you don \u2019 t have diversity at the table , there \u2019 s no chance you \u2019 re gon na see it . You \u2019 re just not . If you \u2019 re a VC and you \u2019 re about deal flow , you \u2019 re missing all kind of deals , because the deals you \u2019 re investing in are what you \u2019 ve known before .\nOne of the things you \u2019 ve spoken about is that when you went to school in the 1980s , women got about 37 percent of computer science degrees and 37 percent of law degrees . Women get now 47 percent of the law degrees , but in computer science , it \u2019 s gone down to 18 percent . What do you think is behind that ?\nI dug through the data , and nobody actually knows the answer , but the thesis is that , when I was a kid , all the games were pretty gender-neutral . I played Pong , I played Breakout , I played the adventure games , but when gaming became very combative , and it became about guns and fighting , girls weren \u2019 t interested in them , and women weren \u2019 t interested in them .\nThe people who were interested in creating them were men , so more men poured in , more games came out like that , and women went , \u201c Oh , so many men in this industry , not interested. \u201d We know that women , even today , who make it through computer science undergraduate degrees and then go to work for one of the big companies \u2014 Google , Amazon , Facebook , Microsoft \u2014 they will tell you that if they join a team that \u2019 s all male , they \u2019 re just not as comfortable . They will seek out the teams that have two or three women because it makes an enormous difference in how they feel and how they perform .\nI see this , and I have data from all over the world . We see this on the village level with women . When 10 women get together , they start to get their voice . They start to demand their rights ; they start to band together to save or to get loans . We see it at the CEO and board level in the United States . You put one woman on a board , nothing is going to change . She assimilates . You put two or three women on a board , they start asking the hard questions . \u201c Why is it like this ? Why aren \u2019 t we creating more of this ? What is going on ? What \u2019 s the latest culture survey ? What does the data say ? \u201d\nI \u2019 d like you to unpack that gaming idea for me , because I haven \u2019 t heard this before . I think the counterargument somebody would naturally come up with is , \u201c Well , is that because men just like video games more ? \u201d\nThere \u2019 s this idea that men are object-oriented and women are people-oriented , and that what you \u2019 re seeing is a reflection of intrinsic differences within the genders that lead to this divergence . Because law , medicine , these were also exclusionary cultures . The culture of surgeons can be a tough culture to break into . Yet there \u2019 s some critical mass that happened there .\nEven if you look at US surgeons or law partners , women are just now breaking that glass ceiling , and that \u2019 s because we have this preponderance [ of ] women coming up . To your question , what causes that ?\nWe have to look at pathways in . If you are Google , Amazon , Microsoft , Facebook , you \u2019 re hiring from the Ivy Leagues . You \u2019 re hiring white guys from a particular kind of school , because that \u2019 s what you know and that \u2019 s what you see .\nThere are more pathways into biology at all kinds of universities . You could go to Harvard Medical School even if you went to the University of Georgia , University of Florida .\nWe have to make sure that colleges craft that first course so it \u2019 s welcoming to women . In math , or in the sciences and in computer science , we know that women don \u2019 t like just theoretical problems , but if you open up that first computer science course and it has real-world problems , more women both sign up and stay in computer science afterward .\nWhat did you make of the Jamie Damore memo at Google ?\nI don \u2019 t think it was accurate at all . Will we ever get to 50/50 women in computer science and men ? Maybe not . But you might get to 40 percent . If we get that far , we will be better off than we are , but we can \u2019 t be where we are today . That just makes no sense .\nThere \u2019 s a feeling among many folks in the technology industry that there is a stultifying political correctness descending . Y Combinator \u2019 s Sam Altman has written about this . People feel that you used to be able to bat around almost any idea , and that was part of what made the American technology sector so great , but now , as people move into this space and try to diversify it , there is a boundary on the conversation that is dangerous . What is your response when you hear that ?\nThat \u2019 s called an old boys \u2019 network . That \u2019 s a club . I don \u2019 t like clubs . I mean , come on . You take the walls down , you democratize something , it \u2019 s better for everybody .\nI am not about political correctness . I am not about window dressing . None of those things are gon na work . I \u2019 m about , how do we take the tools we have and create leverage ?\nI say , \u201c Okay , less than 2 percent of VC funding goes to women ; 0.2 percent of VC funding goes to women of color . Is there a problem there ? Yes. \u201d What I \u2019 m doing is not just using my voice ; I \u2019 m moving my money , and I want a return on my money . I \u2019 m not doing this for social impact . I want a return , but we \u2019 re overindexing for women and people of color , and let \u2019 s see what happens .\nAbsolutely . If you want peace and security in the world , you don \u2019 t want a bomb showing up on our doorstep , or bioterrorism event , you don \u2019 t want Ebola on our doorstep ; you want to create markets and more jobs , yeah . Our voice in the world holds an outsized impact . We need to step up and recognize that and take responsibility for that , and then take the right actions .\nWhen I see what \u2019 s going on in Nairobi , Kenya \u2014 I was just there in January , and their own innovations hubs , they \u2019 re creating products that not only serve Kenyans , that serve 10 other countries in Africa . When you look at the billionaires who are just starting to come out in Africa , it \u2019 s because they \u2019 ve created markets . If we want markets , let \u2019 s not just think about the United States ; let \u2019 s create markets , and make the world better for other people , and sell our products out there .\nI think the American conversation about what is possible has become narrowed over time . You go back 50 years and the organizing precept was that America \u2019 s vision of liberal democracy could defeat communism . I don \u2019 t think when we imagine our role in the world now that there \u2019 s a shared vision of what we are trying to help create .\nHere \u2019 s my question for you , and you can answer it however you hear it . What world is possible in 2030 ? How will we know if we have succeeded ?\nChildhood mortality \u2019 s been cut in half since 1990 . Cut in half ! That is a phenomenal number . It \u2019 s going to get cut in half again by 2030 . Maternal deaths , they can get cut substantially .\nAnother metric is stunting . Stunting is when you \u2019 re not the right height for your age . If you go back to the statistics in London closer to the turn of the century , people were much , much shorter because they didn \u2019 t have all the right nutrition . Today in the United States , you see very little stunting .\nWe have metrics from all over the world where stunting is still happening . You get out of your car in Ethiopia and you don \u2019 t even have to get the data . You can see the stunting . These kids just aren \u2019 t nearly as tall as they should be .\nOne of the things we \u2019 re working on as a foundation is drought-resistant seeds and flood-resistant seeds , because who \u2019 s gon na be most affected by climate change ? It \u2019 s the poor farmers around the world , and when you \u2019 re out in the fields , they \u2019 ll talk to you about the rains coming later , coming less often , and , when they come , flooding .\nI think infant mortality , maternal mortality , can the world feed itself , and are we getting down the emissions that lead up to climate change ? Are we seeing a good downward trajectory on that ? I think those are four of the big metrics .\nWhen I hear people make the case for pessimism , that case often resolves down to climate change . Why , given the trends on climate change , are you optimistic ?\nThat \u2019 s really gon na come down to , \u201c Do we get inventions that we can invent our way out of some of those things ? \u201d Warren Buffett always likes to remind us \u2014 he \u2019 s 87 at this point , he \u2019 s a huge font of wisdom \u2014 that back in the time when it was the horse and buggy and we started having cities , you would \u2019 ve thought we were all gon na drown in shit , and we invented our way out of that problem . When I think about what \u2019 s coming with autonomous vehicles and what \u2019 s already starting to be on the road , think about if those were all electric cars !\nI struggle with this . I tend to have a lot of faith , when I look back over the past couple of hundred years , that we will innovate our way out of problems . But sometimes I think , \u201c Is that just the short span of time in which I \u2019 ve been alive ? Is that letting hope stand in for a plan ? \u201d How do you know when betting on innovation is a bet that is realistic versus just a way to talk yourself out of being afraid of the problem ?\nBill and I have been at this work now , in the foundation , for 17 years , and I see the numbers in child mortality . I see it when I go out to the developing world . I see the science inside the foundation . I sat in a meeting on Thursday where these scientists have hit on something where it looks like , in probably seven years , we won \u2019 t have to fertilize plants anymore . For the developing world , where most people in Africa are still subsistence farmers , holy smokes .\nIf I told you what I see that \u2019 s coming in HIV or malaria \u2014 malaria \u2019 s been around since the time of the Egyptians , okay ? It \u2019 s been with us forever , and it \u2019 s a parasitic disease , it \u2019 s very hard . We actually have a chance of getting rid of malaria in my lifetime .\nAre you talking here about the CRISPR gene drive approach ? When you say what you \u2019 re seeing coming , what are you seeing coming ? How are we going to destroy malaria ?\nWe \u2019 re modifying mosquitoes so they will , in one or two generations , not carry malaria . The females are all the ones that carry malaria . Males don \u2019 t carry malaria . We can modify the males who mate with the females to become sterile , and over a couple generations , there are not enough males to mate with females , and so you crash the population .\nSpeaking of gene editing , there are days when I wonder if this period in history will not be remembered for Donald Trump , or whatever else is going on , but that this will be remembered as the period in which we figured out how to take control of the genome and take control of our own evolution , for better or maybe for worse . Is that me having too much Gattaca in the back of my head ?\nNo . What we \u2019 re gon na be able to do with the genome , and then with precision medicine and artificial intelligence , we \u2019 re on the tip of the cusp of where we might go . That \u2019 s why the ethics pieces in this are deeply important . Bill and I often have this kind of fun debate of , \u201c If you were entering any field now and you had your choice of going into any field , what field would you go in ? \u201d He and I both would go into the cross between biology and computer science . What is gon na happen in those fields , we \u2019 re only beginning .\nTake the spread of disease around the world . People go work in a forest somewhere , we couldn \u2019 t figure out why the malaria kept coming back in the village after we \u2019 d eliminated it , well there \u2019 s a forest kind of malaria . Now we can do modeling of the mosquitoes and how they move around , what distance they go . We can look at GPS data to see how people are moving around , and then you can apply very specific tools ; bed nets in a certain area of malaria , medicines in a certain area . Eventually , hopefully , a vaccine ; eventually you \u2019 ll be able to release mosquitoes , genetically modified mosquitoes .\nWe haven \u2019 t even done the machine learning piece on that yet . Then you cross that with the biology of what we \u2019 re learning about the human body . What we don \u2019 t know yet about our guts is mind-blowing . What we are just learning about the gut microbiome , and , to be frank , but the vaginal microbiome .\nWe don \u2019 t know why certain people in the world uptake HIV quicker , why certain women contract it more from men . It \u2019 s not just about the population and the amount of sex that \u2019 s happening ; it actually has something to do with their vaginal microbiome , we \u2019 ve just recently learned .\nNo one has ever really done a full-scale study of breast milk . One of the things that we just hit on that we \u2019 re learning is the human body sends messages to the child \u2019 s immune system through breast milk . Who knew that ?\nLet me ask you about a place where some of these trends converge . As we pull people and countries out of poverty , they buy more cars , they eat a lot more meat . How do you keep rising prosperity globally , which hopefully we will continue to see more of , from becoming a runaway climate problem ?\nOkay , well , the biggest problem is if you get overpopulation . Bill and I had this false assumption . We thought that as more children survive , a parent is going to have more of them . Luckily , the converse is true . When parents see that two of their children will survive in the developing world and grow up to be healthy , they naturally bring down the number of children they have .\nI think if we bring the population down , we make it voluntary , then , to be honest , it \u2019 s not going to matter what car you sell them . In 10 years , you \u2019 re gon na be selling them a car that doesn \u2019 t have a motor , right ? You \u2019 re gon na be selling them an electric car . One of the things Bill \u2019 s been very vocal about is he \u2019 s working with some VC companies on meatless meat . It \u2019 s all plant-based . Eventually , I think , we will get taste in meat down to a point where people will eat a plant-based meat and feel like , \u201c Hey , this is just as good as the meat I \u2019 m eating . \u201d\nWhat are the biggest global risks in the next 10 years ? What are the things that you are afraid of ?\nA bioterrorist event could spread so quickly , and we are so unprepared for it . So unprepared .\nYeah . Think about how global the US is . If you had something that could spread fast , and you brought it into New York , and especially if it \u2019 s what we call latent \u2014 you don \u2019 t see whatever the disease was for even 24 or 48 hours \u2014 think of the number of people that leave New York every day and go all over the world . We \u2019 re an interconnected world .\nThat \u2019 s why I don \u2019 t like to answer it , and I don \u2019 t talk about it very much .\nOver the course of your travels , what have you come to believe is culturally distinct about America ?\nI don \u2019 t really think the US is as culturally distinct as we think we are . Honestly . I think we think more of ourselves than we should . When I travel around the world , the thing that has struck me time and time and time again is how similar we are .\nI meet people of all income levels in countries all over the world \u2014 we are so the same . We care about many of the same things . We care about our children , we care about our safety , we care about having some economic opportunity so that we can rise to our fullest potential , as can our kids . It \u2019 s the same anywhere I go .\nI if ask a man or a woman farmer who lives a mile and a half out on a dirt road , and I say to them , \u201c Okay , what are your hopes and dreams for your family ? \u201d they always talk about education for their kids , always . I think , \u201c God , that \u2019 s the same thing my parents wanted for me , it \u2019 s the same thing I want for my kids . \u201d\nWe think we \u2019 re so unique , and we \u2019 re not . To be frank , we \u2019 re lucky . We \u2019 re lucky . If you grew up in this country , to have the road infrastructure that we have , to have our health system \u2014 which is imperfect , but for the most part , most people have access to decent health here \u2014 we \u2019 re lucky .\nI want to ask you about a way in which your experience has been unique . You are one of the richest human beings who has ever lived , and that happened at a certain moment in your life . As you \u2019 ve gone through that experience , what problems in your life have you found that money can solve , and what problems can it not solve ?\nI grew up in a very middle-income family in Dallas , Texas . I have three siblings . It was very difficult for my parents to put us through college . We could see that , but they were insistent that all four of us would go to college and they would figure out a way to pay for it , which is a very powerful message from your parents .\nAs I \u2019 ve come into this situation that I can \u2019 t believe I find myself in , the thing that I always come back to is it \u2019 s about your values . Values , values , values . Everything that I am about is about trying to live out my values and trying to teach my kids our values , and to question , do we have the right values ? Are we living up to those ? I don \u2019 t think that changes . Low , middle , or high income , if you have good values and you live and teach those , you \u2019 re gon na get off track here and there , your kids are gon na get off track here and there , but you \u2019 re gon na be basically okay .\nOne thing when you \u2019 re wealthy is you have lots of choices in life about who will serve up what to you , how you spend your time . You see some of those kids are actually very unhealthy , because the parents aren \u2019 t home , they \u2019 re busy out doing other things . I really try to make sure our kids have a diverse set of friends , and we \u2019 re lucky enough to be able to travel . They have gotten to go on safari in Kenya , but boy have they spent a lot of time seeing poverty in Kenya , and South Africa , and Tanzania , because to me , it \u2019 s important they see the whole world , not this little just pinprick of where they live in Seattle .\nWhat are three books you \u2019 ve read over the years that you would recommend that others read ?\nI would say Sapiens , for sure . Love that book . Cry , the Beloved Country , by Alan Paton , definitely changed some of my views about the world . And then the other one I would say \u2014 my husband and I often read books and then pass them to each other , and this one is currently his favorite book , so I \u2019 m reading it , and I \u2019 m loving it , but I \u2019 m only a quarter way through : Enlightenment Now by Steven Pinker .",

I played Pong, I played Breakout, I played the adventure games, but when gaming became very combative, and it became about guns and fighting, girls weren\u2019t interested in them, and women weren\u2019t interested in them.\n\nThe people who were interested in creating them were men, so more men poured in, more games came out like that, and women went, \u201cOh, so many men in this industry, not interested.\u201d We know that women, even today, who make it through computer science undergraduate degrees and then go to work for one of the big companies \u2014 Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft \u2014 they will tell you that if they join a team that\u2019s all male, they\u2019re just not as comfortable. They will seek out the teams that have two or three women because it makes an enormous difference in how they feel and how they perform.\n\nI see this, and I have data from all over the world. We see this on the village level with women. When 10 women get together, they start to get their voice. They start to demand their rights; they start to band together to save or to get loans. We see it at the CEO and board level in the United States. You put one woman on a board, nothing is going to change. She assimilates. You put two or three women on a board, they start asking the hard questions. \u201cWhy is it like this? Why aren\u2019t we creating more of this? What is going on? What\u2019s the latest culture survey? What does the data say?\u201d\n\nEzra Klein\n\nI\u2019d like you to unpack that gaming idea for me, because I haven\u2019t heard this before. I think the counterargument somebody would naturally come up with is, \u201cWell, is that because men just like video games more?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s this idea that men are object-oriented and women are people-oriented, and that what you\u2019re seeing is a reflection of intrinsic differences within the genders that lead to this divergence. Because law, medicine, these were also exclusionary cultures. The culture of surgeons can be a tough culture to break into. Yet there\u2019s some critical mass that happened there.\n\nMelinda Gate\n\nEven if you look at US surgeons or law partners, women are just now breaking that glass ceiling, and that\u2019s because we have this preponderance [of] women coming up. To your question, what causes that?\n\nWe have to look at pathways in. If you are Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, you\u2019re hiring from the Ivy Leagues. You\u2019re hiring white guys from a particular kind of school, because that\u2019s what you know and that\u2019s what you see.\n\nThere are more pathways into biology at all kinds of universities. You could go to Harvard Medical School even if you went to the University of Georgia, University of Florida.\n\nWe have to make sure that colleges craft that first course so it\u2019s welcoming to women. In math, or in the sciences and in computer science, we know that women don\u2019t like just theoretical problems, but if you open up that first computer science course and it has real-world problems, more women both sign up and stay in computer science afterward.\n\nEzra Klein\n\nWhat did you make of the Jamie Damore memo at Google?\n\nMelinda Gates\n\nI don\u2019t think it was accurate at all. Will we ever get to 50/50 women in computer science and men? Maybe not. But you might get to 40 percent. If we get that far, we will be better off than we are, but we can\u2019t be where we are today. That just makes no sense.\n\nEzra Klein\n\nThere\u2019s a feeling among many folks in the technology industry that there is a stultifying political correctness descending. Y Combinator\u2019s Sam Altman has written about this. People feel that you used to be able to bat around almost any idea, and that was part of what made the American technology sector so great, but now, as people move into this space and try to diversify it, there is a boundary on the conversation that is dangerous. What is your response when you hear that?\n\nMelinda Gates\n\nThat\u2019s called an old boys\u2019 network. That\u2019s a club. I don\u2019t like clubs. I mean, come on. You take the walls down, you democratize something, it\u2019s better for everybody.\n\nI am not about political correctness. I am not about window dressing. None of those things are gonna work. I\u2019m about, how do we take the tools we have and create leverage?\n\nI say, \u201cOkay, less than 2 percent of VC funding goes to women; 0.2 percent of VC funding goes to women of color. Is there a problem there? Yes.\u201d What I\u2019m doing is not just using my voice; I\u2019m moving my money, and I want a return on my money. I\u2019m not doing this for social impact. I want a return, but we\u2019re overindexing for women and people of color, and let\u2019s see what happens.\n\nWhat the world could look like in 2030\n\nEzra Klein\n\nIs there a self-interested case for American foreign aid?\n\nMelinda Gates\n\nAbsolutely. If you want peace and security in the world, you don\u2019t want a bomb showing up on our doorstep, or bioterrorism event, you don\u2019t want Ebola on our doorstep; you want to create markets and more jobs, yeah. Our voice in the world holds an outsized impact. We need to step up and recognize that and take responsibility for that, and then take the right actions.\n\nWhen I see what\u2019s going on in Nairobi, Kenya \u2014 I was just there in January, and their own innovations hubs, they\u2019re creating products that not only serve Kenyans, that serve 10 other countries in Africa. When you look at the billionaires who are just starting to come out in Africa, it\u2019s because they\u2019ve created markets. If we want markets, let\u2019s not just think about the United States; let\u2019s create markets, and make the world better for other people, and sell our products out there.\n\nEzra Klein\n\nI think the American conversation about what is possible has become narrowed over time. You go back 50 years and the organizing precept was that America\u2019s vision of liberal democracy could defeat communism. I don\u2019t think when we imagine our role in the world now that there\u2019s a shared vision of what we are trying to help create.\n\nHere\u2019s my question for you, and you can answer it however you hear it. What world is possible in 2030? How will we know if we have succeeded?\n\nMelinda Gates\n\nChildhood mortality\u2019s been cut in half since 1990. Cut in half! That is a phenomenal number. It\u2019s going to get cut in half again by 2030. Maternal deaths, they can get cut substantially.\n\nAnother metric is stunting. Stunting is when you\u2019re not the right height for your age. If you go back to the statistics in London closer to the turn of the century, people were much, much shorter because they didn\u2019t have all the right nutrition. Today in the United States, you see very little stunting.\n\nWe have metrics from all over the world where stunting is still happening. You get out of your car in Ethiopia and you don\u2019t even have to get the data. You can see the stunting. These kids just aren\u2019t nearly as tall as they should be.\n\nOne of the things we\u2019re working on as a foundation is drought-resistant seeds and flood-resistant seeds, because who\u2019s gonna be most affected by climate change? It\u2019s the poor farmers around the world, and when you\u2019re out in the fields, they\u2019ll talk to you about the rains coming later, coming less often, and, when they come, flooding.\n\nI think infant mortality, maternal mortality, can the world feed itself, and are we getting down the emissions that lead up to climate change? Are we seeing a good downward trajectory on that? I think those are four of the big metrics.\n\nEzra Klein\n\nWhen I hear people make the case for pessimism, that case often resolves down to climate change. Why, given the trends on climate change, are you optimistic?\n\nMelinda Gates\n\nThat\u2019s really gonna come down to, \u201cDo we get inventions that we can invent our way out of some of those things?\u201d Warren Buffett always likes to remind us \u2014 he\u2019s 87 at this point, he\u2019s a huge font of wisdom \u2014 that back in the time when it was the horse and buggy and we started having cities, you would\u2019ve thought we were all gonna drown in shit, and we invented our way out of that problem. When I think about what\u2019s coming with autonomous vehicles and what\u2019s already starting to be on the road, think about if those were all electric cars!\n\nEzra Klein\n\nI struggle with this. I tend to have a lot of faith, when I look back over the past couple of hundred years, that we will innovate our way out of problems. But sometimes I think, \u201cIs that just the short span of time in which I\u2019ve been alive? Is that letting hope stand in for a plan?\u201d How do you know when betting on innovation is a bet that is realistic versus just a way to talk yourself out of being afraid of the problem?\n\nMelinda Gates\n\nBill and I have been at this work now, in the foundation, for 17 years, and I see the numbers in child mortality. I see it when I go out to the developing world. I see the science inside the foundation. I sat in a meeting on Thursday where these scientists have hit on something where it looks like, in probably seven years, we won\u2019t have to fertilize plants anymore. For the developing world, where most people in Africa are still subsistence farmers, holy smokes.\n\nIf I told you what I see that\u2019s coming in HIV or malaria \u2014 malaria\u2019s been around since the time of the Egyptians, okay? It\u2019s been with us forever, and it\u2019s a parasitic disease, it\u2019s very hard. We actually have a chance of getting rid of malaria in my lifetime.\n\nEzra Klein\n\nAre you talking here about the CRISPR gene drive approach? When you say what you\u2019re seeing coming, what are you seeing coming? How are we going to destroy malaria?\n\nMelinda Gates\n\nWe\u2019re modifying mosquitoes so they will, in one or two generations, not carry malaria. The females are all the ones that carry malaria. Males don\u2019t carry malaria. We can modify the males who mate with the females to become sterile, and over a couple generations, there are not enough males to mate with females, and so you crash the population.\n\nWhere the next breakthroughs will come from\n\nEzra Klein\n\nSpeaking of gene editing, there are days when I wonder if this period in history will not be remembered for Donald Trump, or whatever else is going on, but that this will be remembered as the period in which we figured out how to take control of the genome and take control of our own evolution, for better or maybe for worse. Is that me having too much Gattaca in the back of my head?\n\nMelinda Gates\n\nNo. What we\u2019re gonna be able to do with the genome, and then with precision medicine and artificial intelligence, we\u2019re on the tip of the cusp of where we might go. That\u2019s why the ethics pieces in this are deeply important. Bill and I often have this kind of fun debate of, \u201cIf you were entering any field now and you had your choice of going into any field, what field would you go in?\u201d He and I both would go into the cross between biology and computer science. What is gonna happen in those fields, we\u2019re only beginning.\n\nEzra Klein\n\nTell me a bit about that.\n\nMelinda Gates\n\nTake the spread of disease around the world. People go work in a forest somewhere, we couldn\u2019t figure out why the malaria kept coming back in the village after we\u2019d eliminated it, well there\u2019s a forest kind of malaria. Now we can do modeling of the mosquitoes and how they move around, what distance they go. We can look at GPS data to see how people are moving around, and then you can apply very specific tools; bed nets in a certain area of malaria, medicines in a certain area. Eventually, hopefully, a vaccine; eventually you\u2019ll be able to release mosquitoes, genetically modified mosquitoes.\n\nWe haven\u2019t even done the machine learning piece on that yet. Then you cross that with the biology of what we\u2019re learning about the human body. What we don\u2019t know yet about our guts is mind-blowing. What we are just learning about the gut microbiome, and, to be frank, but the vaginal microbiome.\n\nWe don\u2019t know why certain people in the world uptake HIV quicker, why certain women contract it more from men. It\u2019s not just about the population and the amount of sex that\u2019s happening; it actually has something to do with their vaginal microbiome, we\u2019ve just recently learned.\n\nNo one has ever really done a full-scale study of breast milk. One of the things that we just hit on that we\u2019re learning is the human body sends messages to the child\u2019s immune system through breast milk. Who knew that?\n\nEzra Klein\n\nLet me ask you about a place where some of these trends converge. As we pull people and countries out of poverty, they buy more cars, they eat a lot more meat. How do you keep rising prosperity globally, which hopefully we will continue to see more of, from becoming a runaway climate problem?\n\nMelinda Gates\n\nOkay, well, the biggest problem is if you get overpopulation. Bill and I had this false assumption. We thought that as more children survive, a parent is going to have more of them. Luckily, the converse is true. When parents see that two of their children will survive in the developing world and grow up to be healthy, they naturally bring down the number of children they have.\n\nI think if we bring the population down, we make it voluntary, then, to be honest, it\u2019s not going to matter what car you sell them. In 10 years, you\u2019re gonna be selling them a car that doesn\u2019t have a motor, right? You\u2019re gonna be selling them an electric car. One of the things Bill\u2019s been very vocal about is he\u2019s working with some VC companies on meatless meat. It\u2019s all plant-based. Eventually, I think, we will get taste in meat down to a point where people will eat a plant-based meat and feel like, \u201cHey, this is just as good as the meat I\u2019m eating.\u201d\n\nEzra Klein\n\nWhat are the biggest global risks in the next 10 years? What are the things that you are afraid of?\n\nMelinda Gates\n\nA bioterrorism event. Definitely. Most definitely.\n\nEzra Klein\n\nWhy is that at the top of your list?\n\nMelinda Gates\n\nA bioterrorist event could spread so quickly, and we are so unprepared for it. So unprepared.\n\nEzra Klein\n\nEven now?\n\nMelinda Gates\n\nYeah. Think about how global the US is. If you had something that could spread fast, and you brought it into New York, and especially if it\u2019s what we call latent \u2014 you don\u2019t see whatever the disease was for even 24 or 48 hours \u2014 think of the number of people that leave New York every day and go all over the world. We\u2019re an interconnected world.\n\nEzra Klein\n\nThat is a genuinely scary answer to that question.\n\nMelinda Gates\n\nThat\u2019s why I don\u2019t like to answer it, and I don\u2019t talk about it very much.\n\nAmerica is less distinct than we think\n\nEzra Klein\n\nOver the course of your travels, what have you come to believe is culturally distinct about America?\n\nMelinda Gates\n\nI don\u2019t really think the US is as culturally distinct as we think we are. Honestly. I think we think more of ourselves than we should. When I travel around the world, the thing that has struck me time and time and time again is how similar we are.\n\nI meet people of all income levels in countries all over the world \u2014 we are so the same. We care about many of the same things. We care about our children, we care about our safety, we care about having some economic opportunity so that we can rise to our fullest potential, as can our kids. It\u2019s the same anywhere I go.\n\nI if ask a man or a woman farmer who lives a mile and a half out on a dirt road, and I say to them, \u201cOkay, what are your hopes and dreams for your family?\u201d they always talk about education for their kids, always. I think, \u201cGod, that\u2019s the same thing my parents wanted for me, it\u2019s the same thing I want for my kids.\u201d\n\nWe think we\u2019re so unique, and we\u2019re not. To be frank, we\u2019re lucky. We\u2019re lucky. If you grew up in this country, to have the road infrastructure that we have, to have our health system \u2014 which is imperfect, but for the most part, most people have access to decent health here \u2014 we\u2019re lucky.\n\nEzra Klein\n\nI want to ask you about a way in which your experience has been unique. You are one of the richest human beings who has ever lived, and that happened at a certain moment in your life. As you\u2019ve gone through that experience, what problems in your life have you found that money can solve, and what problems can it not solve?\n\nMelinda Gates\n\nI grew up in a very middle-income family in Dallas, Texas. I have three siblings. It was very difficult for my parents to put us through college. We could see that, but they were insistent that all four of us would go to college and they would figure out a way to pay for it, which is a very powerful message from your parents.\n\nAs I\u2019ve come into this situation that I can\u2019t believe I find myself in, the thing that I always come back to is it\u2019s about your values. Values, values, values. Everything that I am about is about trying to live out my values and trying to teach my kids our values, and to question, do we have the right values? Are we living up to those? I don\u2019t think that changes. Low, middle, or high income, if you have good values and you live and teach those, you\u2019re gonna get off track here and there, your kids are gonna get off track here and there, but you\u2019re gonna be basically okay.\n\nOne thing when you\u2019re wealthy is you have lots of choices in life about who will serve up what to you, how you spend your time. You see some of those kids are actually very unhealthy, because the parents aren\u2019t home, they\u2019re busy out doing other things. I really try to make sure our kids have a diverse set of friends, and we\u2019re lucky enough to be able to travel. They have gotten to go on safari in Kenya, but boy have they spent a lot of time seeing poverty in Kenya, and South Africa, and Tanzania, because to me, it\u2019s important they see the whole world, not this little just pinprick of where they live in Seattle.\n\nEzra Klein\n\nWhat are three books you\u2019ve read over the years that you would recommend that others read?\n\nMelinda Gates\n\nI would say Sapiens, for sure. Love that book. Cry, the Beloved Country, by Alan Paton, definitely changed some of my views about the world. And then the other one I would say \u2014 my husband and I often read books and then pass them to each other, and this one is currently his favorite book, so I\u2019m reading it, and I\u2019m loving it, but I\u2019m only a quarter way through: Enlightenment Now by Steven Pinker.",
