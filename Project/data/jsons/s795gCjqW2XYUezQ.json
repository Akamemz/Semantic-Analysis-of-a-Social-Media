    "content": "Obama And House GOP Engage In Fiscal Cliff Talks , Only Briefly With Each Other\nThe president and House Republicans continued to snipe at each other Wednesday over the impending set of automatic tax hikes and spending cuts known as the fiscal cliff . They traded accusations and blame during another day with plenty of talk , but \u2014 until late in the day , at least \u2014 no negotiations .\nThe Associated Press , citing a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner , said President Obama and Boehner spoke briefly Wednesday afternoon by phone . `` The call raises the possibility that negotiations will soon resume between the White House and congressional leaders , '' the AP reported .\nEarlier in the day , the two sides were speaking publicly , but not to one another . The Republicans went first :\n`` We want to sit down with the president . We want to talk specifics , '' said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia . `` We put an offer on the table now . He 's out of hand rejected that . Where are the specifics ? Where are the discussions ? Nothing is going on . ''\n`` If the president does n't agree with our proposal and our outline , I think he 's got an obligation to send one to the Congress \u2014 and a plan that can pass both chambers of Congress . If you look at the plans that the White House has talked about thus far , they could n't pass either house of the Congress . ''\nOf course , neither could the plan Boehner has tabled , with a promise of $ 800 billion in revenue raised by closing unspecified tax loopholes .\nThe White House spent a considerable amount of effort in public on Wednesday trying to demolish the mathematical and political premises of that proposal .\nWhite House economic adviser Jason Furman gave reporters a detailed handout explaining why \u2014 unless you wanted to eliminate or severely curtail tax deductions for the middle class or for charitable giving \u2014 the Republican plan would only produce $ 450 billion in revenue , not $ 800 billion .\nPresident Obama went before the Business Roundtable , a group of corporate CEOs who have not been friendly to him in the past , to suggest that no deal could be done until the Republicans gave in on raising tax rates . Said Obama :\n`` Now , we 've seen some movement over the last several days among some Republicans . I think there 's a recognition that maybe they can accept some rate increases as long as it 's combined with serious entitlement reform and additional spending cuts .

''\nIn which case , the president said , we could get a deal in about a week .\nBut that makes it sound too easy . Raising tax rates is by far the most difficult issue for Republicans and would probably have to be addressed with a creative plan to help Boehner deal with opposition among his conservative House majority .\nBut White House officials seemed to be suggesting that Obama might not even sit down with Republicans at the negotiating table until they cried uncle on tax rates .\nOn Wednesday , Obama also delivered a warning to Republicans not to tie the fiscal cliff debate to the fight over raising the country 's borrowing limit :\n`` If Congress in any way suggests that they 're going to tie negotiations to debt ceiling votes and take us to the brink of default once again as part of a budget negotiation \u2014 which by the way we have never done in our history until we did it last year \u2014 I will not play that game .
