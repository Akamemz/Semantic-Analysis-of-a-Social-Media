    "content": "The Trump administration \u2019 s self-imposed deadline to bring Canada into a revised North American Free Trade Agreement is Sunday \u2014 and there \u2019 s a chance negotiators will miss it .\nThere was a little optimism late Friday , after Reuters reported that Mexico and the US decided to hold off publishing the text of its United States-Mexico bilateral trade deal on Friday \u2014 a signal that both weren \u2019 t quite ready to move ahead without Canada .\nBut the prospects of a last-minute agreement with Canada remain grim after weeks of a negotiating impasse over a revised NAFTA , the trilateral trade agreement between the US , Canada , and Mexico .\nPresident Donald Trump vented his frustration with Canada during a press conference in New York this week in which he bashed their negotiators and claimed he rejected a one-on-one meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the sidelines of the United Nations . ( Canada says it never asked for such a meeting . )\n\u201c We \u2019 re very unhappy with the negotiations and the negotiating style of Canada , \u201d Trump said . \u201c We don \u2019 t like their representative very much . They have taken advantage . \u201d\n\u201c The deal is done , \u201d he added . \u201c Now it has to go through Congress and a lot of things have to happen . \u201d\nThe deal Trump is referring to is the United States-Mexico bilateral agreement the two countries struck in August , which the president now wants to submit to Congress as a NAFTA replacement . But it \u2019 s unclear if Congress will accept a deal without Canada . Though Republican leaders have also chastised Canada in recent weeks , there \u2019 s fairly strong bipartisan support for keeping Canada part of the trade pact .\nCanada knows this , which has bolstered the country \u2019 s negotiating position . Even as the Trump administration prepared to forge ahead , it \u2019 s not altogether rejecting a future deal with Canada .\n\u201c We \u2019 re going to go ahead with Mexico , \u201d US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer , who \u2019 s leading the negotiations , said this week . \u201c If Canada comes along , that would be best . If Canada comes along later , then that \u2019 s what will happen . We certainly want to have an agreement with Canada . \u201d\nWhich means the Trump administration might find a way to make the September 30 deadline flexible , and continue talks with Canada . How that will work practically is still unclear , but as the NAFTA deadline nears , here \u2019 s a look at how the two countries got here , and what might happen if there \u2019 s no agreement this weekend .\nTrump hates NAFTA . \u201c I don \u2019 t like NAFTA , \u201d he said Wednesday . \u201c I never liked it . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s loathing of the trade agreement carried from his campaign to his presidency , and in August 2017 , all three countries began talks to renegotiate the trilateral trade deal .\nAbout a year later , the US and Mexico reached a preliminary bilateral pact that dealt with some issues between the two countries \u2014 but wasn \u2019 t exactly a NAFTA replacement . Canada then rejoined negotiations with the goal of reaching a revised agreement \u2014 NAFTA 2.0 , if you will \u2014 to submit to Congress .\nThe Trump administration had initially pushed to reach a deal by the end of August . It was a manufactured deadline \u2014 the United States wants to sign a deal with Mexico before December 1 , when the country \u2019 s new leftist president , Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador , takes power . ( Obrador has said he wants a trilateral deal . )\nThe US and Canada , of course , did not reach a deal by the end of August .\nBut the Trump administration went ahead and notified Congress that Trump intended to sign a new trade agreement with Mexico \u2014 \u201c and Canada , if it is willing \u201d \u2014 within 90 days . This is required under the Trade Promotion Authority ( TPA ) , which gives the president the power to negotiate trade deals and Congress to approve them with an up-or-down vote .\nThe TPA , however , demands that text for any trade agreement be delivered no later than 60 days before signing , which is how the September 30 deadline came to be . The plan was for Canada and the US to negotiate for another month , then submit the text for a trilateral deal .\nNow the US and Canada are speeding toward that date without a deal . The text of any trade deal the Trump administration wants to submit to Congress will likely be published by Sunday . What it might look like is anyone \u2019 s guess .\nThe language of the text will likely provide clues as to whether the US is really forging ahead with a United States-Mexico bilateral deal , or still leaving an avenue open for Canada .\nAccording to the Canadian news outlet CBC , the agreement may include at least a dozen chapters that have been agreed to by all three NAFTA partners \u2014 Canada , the US , and Mexico \u2014 which would hint that this is a trilateral agreement in-progress .\nThe administration already took a creative approach to TPA with their notification to Congress , and adding Canada later now would be even more unorthodox . Democrats have already challenged the administration on their bait-and-switch , saying that they can \u2019 t just replace NAFTA with an entirely new bilateral trade deal .\nUltimately , it will be up to Congress whether they \u2019 ll accept the administration \u2019 s machinations on TPA . They might , because lawmakers have little appetite for a bilateral deal . They want Canada included . \u201c Congress seems to be making it very clear on both sides of the aisle , \u201d Marc Busch , an international trade expert at Georgetown University , said .\nSome lawmakers have adopted the administration \u2019 s posture on Canada , pressuring them to get in line or else . Rep. Steve Scalise ( R-LA ) warned Canada in a letter that if it \u201c does not cooperate in the negotiations , Congress will have no choice but to consider options about how best to move forward and stand up for American workers . \u201d\nBut this is likely bluster \u2014 and Canada can see right through it . \u201c Steve Scalise can say whatever he likes , \u201d Busch said . \u201c Canada does have the upper hand right now . \u201d\nCanada is betting that a trilateral deal really is the only practical way forward . Canada is the US \u2019 s closest trading partner and the supply chains are so intricately intertwined . Certain provisions in the US-Mexico bilateral pact were also negotiated with the understanding that Canada would eventually be included \u2014 such as the percentages of each car that must be made in each country to avoid tariffs .\n\u201c The [ US-Mexico ] agreement was calibrated around the idea that Canada was going to be a part of this deal and these are really detailed calculations , \u201d said Chad Bown , of the Peterson Institute for International Economics , said . If Canada is out , Bown added , those numbers will likely need to be recalculated .\nAdd to that Congress \u2019 s reluctance . Even if Trump moves ahead and signs a bilateral deal with Mexico , Congress likely won \u2019 t vote on it until next year . If Democrats retake one or both chambers , a deal without Canada is likely dead on arrival .\nWhich is why Canada doesn \u2019 t feel all that rushed by the TPA deadlines . Canada wants to make \u201c a deal that works for Canada , \u201d Busch said . \u201c That \u2019 s exactly what Canada is doing . \u201d\nBoth the US and Canada may agree that a NAFTA 2.0 is going to happen eventually \u2014 but for now , each side seems entrenched .\nThe US wants greater access to Canada \u2019 s dairy market , but it \u2019 s a politically charged issue in Canada , particularly in Quebec , which has inconveniently timed provincial elections on October 1 .\nCanada wants to keep Chapter 19 , a provision that allows for an independent mechanism to resolve special trade disputes . It also wants to keep cultural exemptions for Canadian media and the arts , a symbolic stance to defend Canadian culture .\nAlso looming over the negotiations are Trump \u2019 s steel and aluminum tariffs \u2014 but specifically the mechanism used to impose tariffs , Section 232 , which requires a national security justification .\n\u201c Canada \u2014 more so than Mexico \u2014 is very offended by the Section 232 tariffs against its industries , \u201d said Sarah Goldfeder , a principal at the Earnscliffe Strategy Group and a fellow at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute . Canada sees the Trump administration \u2019 s implication that the country is a national security threat to the United States as beyond insulting , particularly because Canada is a defense partner .\nCanada wants some protections against these kinds of tariffs . The Trump administration initially used this as a bargaining chip \u2014 basically saying to Canada , \u201c Let \u2019 s get somewhere on NAFTA , and then we \u2019 ll talk tariffs. \u201d But the administration has since tiptoed away from that rhetoric , trying to separate the two negotiations .\nTrump has also threatened automobile tariffs on Canada . They would hurt US consumers and manufacturers , but they would be ruinous for Canada .\nCanada and the United States agreed to negotiate in private , so it \u2019 s unclear how close they might be on resolving these issues . But given comments from both the US and Canada in recent days , a last-minute consensus doesn \u2019 t exactly seem within reach .\nThat doesn \u2019 t mean negotiations will abruptly end if they two sides don \u2019 t reach an agreement by the Sunday deadline . Indeed , there \u2019 s a chance that missing the deadline might still allow Trump to declare victory on his US-Mexico \u2014 or \u201c USM \u201d \u2014 deal .
