    "content": "It would have been unthinkable just a few months ago , when the majority leader , Harry Reid , was still holding out hope for a long-lasting deal with Republicans and insisting that federal judges , because of their lifetime appointments , should still be subject to supermajority thresholds . But Mr. Reid , along with all but three Senate Democrats , was pushed to act by the Republicans \u2019 refusal to allow any appointments to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit , just because they wanted to keep a conservative majority on that important court .\nThat move was as outrageous as the tactic they used earlier this year to try to cripple the National Labor Relations Board and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( which they despise ) by blocking all appointments to those agencies . That obstruction was removed in July when Mr. Reid threatened to end the filibuster and Republicans backed down . The recent blockade of judges to the D.C. appellate court was the last straw .\nRepublicans warned that the rule change could haunt the Democrats if they lost the White House and the Senate . But the Constitution gives presidents the right to nominate top officials in their administration and name judges , and it says nothing about the ability of a Senate minority to stop them . ( The practice barely existed before the 1970s . ) From now on , voters will have to understand that presidents are likely to get their way on nominations if their party controls the Senate .\nGiven the extreme degree of Republican obstruction during the Obama administration , the Democrats had little choice but to change the filibuster rule . As Mr. Reid noted on the floor , half of all filibusters waged against nominations in Senate history have occurred since Mr. Obama was elected . Twenty of his district court nominees were filibustered ; only three such filibusters took place before he took office . There has also been a record-setting amount of delay in approving the president \u2019 s choices for cabinet positions and federal agency posts , even when no objections have been raised about a nominee \u2019 s qualifications .\nThe rule change does not end the 60-vote threshold for blocking legislation , which we have argued is worth preserving . But the vote may lead to broader filibuster changes . A proposal by several younger Democratic senators to require \u201c talking filibusters \u201d \u2014 forcing objecting lawmakers to stand up at length and make their cases \u2014 may well gain steam now , and it could finally spell an end to logjams that have prevented important legislation from reaching votes .",
