On Monday , the longtime leader , who heads the conservative Likud party , acknowledged his failure to cobble together a coalition from last month 's muddled election results , and he returned the mandate to President Reuven Rivlin .\nNetanyahu had been given 28 days to secure the 61 seats necessary to achieve a functioning majority by building support from smaller parties in the 120-member Knesset . After the most recent election \u2014 the country 's second inconclusive vote in less than six months \u2014 Likud won 32 seats , but the scandal-plagued prime minister could not make up the gap necessary to obtain a majority and secure his fifth straight term in office .\nNow , on Netanyahu 's 70th birthday , Rivlin has turned to the prime minister 's principal rival , Benny Gantz , a former army chief of staff and leader of the centrist Blue and White party . In a tweet on Monday , Gantz responded to the new mandate quite simply : `` It is time for blue and white . ''\n`` The time of spin is over ; it is now time for action , '' his party said in a statement posted to Twitter . `` Blue and White is determined to form the liberal unity government , led by Benny Gantz , that the people of Israel voted for a month ago .
