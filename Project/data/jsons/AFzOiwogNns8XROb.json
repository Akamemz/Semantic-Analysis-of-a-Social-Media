''\nIn front of thousands of Trump fans , Palin handed Trump his most high-profile endorsement yet , just two weeks out from the Iowa caucuses .\n`` Heads are spinnin ' . Media heads are spinning ! This is going to be so much fun ! '' Palin yelled from the stage . `` Are you ready to make America great again ? ''\nPalin 's at times disjointed 20-minute speech was filled with Palinisms like `` pussy-footin ' , '' `` hallelujah '' and `` you betcha . '' With Trump looking on from beside her , she hailed the real estate developer as a `` compassionate , '' `` refreshing '' and `` self-made '' man who would bring the country back from President Barack Obama 's disastrous tenure .\n`` Looking around at all of you , you hard working Iowa families , you farm families and teachers and teamsters and cops and cooks , you rock and rollers and holy rollers ! '' Palin said . `` You all make the world go around and now our cause is one . ''\nPalin , who has spoken openly since the 2008 campaign of her anger at the treatment she received from the press and Republican Party leaders , appeared to recognize that Tuesday night marked a moment of comeback .\n`` I was told , 'You 're going to get so clobbered in the press , you are just gon na get beat up , chewed up and spit out . ' And I 'm thinking -- and ?
