    "content": "A top Republican lawmaker claimed Thursday terrorists have already started to change their behavior after a self-described NSA whistleblower leaked information about classified U.S. surveillance programs to various media outlets , saying the leaks may make it `` harder to track bad guys . ''\nThe chairman of the House Intelligence Committee , Rep. Mike Rogers , R-Mich. , declined to provide specifics on what terrorists he was referring to , only saying there are `` changes we can already see being made by the folks who wish to do us harm , and our allies harm . ''\nHe also said the revelations might `` make it harder to track bad guys trying to harm U.S. citizens in the United States . ''\nFormer National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden made headlines worldwide after he leaked information about two NSA programs that collect millions of telephone records and track Internet activity .\nSnowden fled to Hong Kong in May and has granted some interviews since then , saying he hopes to stay there and fight any charges that may yet be filed against him .\nMore On This ... FBI director in the dark about IRS probe , defends surveillance programs\nThe ranking Democrat on the committee , Rep. C.A . Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland , said he 's concerned that Snowden fled to Hong Kong because of China 's history of spying on the U.S .\n`` It seems unusual that he would be in China and asking for the protection of the Chinese government ... but we 're going to investigate , '' Ruppersberger said .\nRogers added , `` Clearly , we 're going to make a thorough scrub of what his China connections are . ''\nRogers and Ruppersberger spoke to reporters after a closed committee briefing with the NSA 's director , Gen. Keith Alexander , who said he hopes to declassify details of dozens of attacks disrupted by the programs . Alexander said officials do n't want to `` cause another terror attack by giving out too much information . ''\nOfficials have thrown out widely varying numbers of the attacks they say the broad surveillance of Americans ' phone and online usage has thwarted . On Wednesday , Alexander said dozens have been stopped . Ruppersberger said the surveillance `` has thwarted 10 possible terrorist attacks , '' then amended that number to be in line with Alexander 's statement . In the initial days after the disclosures of the programs , officials cited one case .\nThe disclosures raised privacy concerns as Americans -- some of them members of Congress -- learned for the first time the extent of surveillance powers granted by the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to help U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies track terrorists .\nInvestigators have been trying to determine which facilities the 29-year-old Snowden visited during his intelligence career to decide how much classified data he had access to as a computer systems analyst for the NSA and earlier for the CIA , according to two congressional staffers . They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to describe the investigation publicly .\n`` It 's clear he attempted to go places he was not authorized to go , '' within the classified systems , Rogers said . He called Snowden `` a fairly low-level individual , but because of his position in the IT system had access to certain pieces of information that , candidly , he did not understand , or had the full scope of what these programs where , who decided on his own he was going to release this information .
