    "content": "MONTGOMERY , Alabama \u2014 Sen. Rand Paul ( R-KY ) , a likely 2016 Republican presidential candidate , fired up a nearly two-thousand-strong crowd with a keynote speech to the Alabama Republican Party \u2019 s Winter Dinner on Friday night , right before the White House hopeful makes a swing through South Florida .\nPaul was met with several standing ovations throughout the speech , including at the end , in an address filled with many of the major themes he \u2019 s likely to pursue assuming he makes a bid for the White House .\n\u201c I have good news and bad news : The good news is your government is open , \u201d Paul said . \u201c The bad news is your government is open . You remember there was this shutdown about a year ago and in Washington everyone was clamoring , everyone was worried . I went home to Kentucky and you know what they said : \u2018 Why in the hell did you open it back up ? \u2019 \u201d\nPaul shifted into discussing how different Washington is from the rest of America .\n\u201c When I was first elected , I proposed that we cut $ 500 billion in spending , and everybody in Washington said \u2018 Oh my goodness , this guy is crazy\u2014he wants to really cut spending , he wants to really balance the budget , \u2019 \u201d Paul said . \u201c I got home back in Kentucky , and you know what they said ? They said that \u2019 s a good start . They said now what are you going to do about the $ 18 trillion in debt ? They \u2019 re not even concerned just with the deficit . In the real world , the people want us to balance the budget every year and actually do something about the $ 18 trillion debt . \u201d\nPaul noted the difference in culture is largely due to the liberal media on Capitol Hill and throughout D.C .\n\u201c The thing is is that the media , the liberal media , the people who call us flyover country America , know nothing about us , \u201d Paul said . \u201c They don \u2019 t represent us . They don \u2019 t have our values . And the thing is is that somehow Washington gets distracted into thinking this is what America is really about . Raise your hand if you \u2019 ve spent more than you bring in chronically for the last 10 , 20 or 30 years . \u201d\n\u201c Nobody does that , \u201d Paul said . \u201c Everyone balances their family budget . They think we \u2019 re extremists . Somebody said \u2018 oh this is extreme. \u2019 And I said , \u2018 to balance the budget , to only spend what comes in , is extreme ? \u2019 \u201d\nPaul had opened his speech by quoting President Abraham Lincoln when it comes to matters of justice\u2014using it to transition into an example of local police officers in Tarrant , Alabama , doing something terrific for a woman in need right before Christmas .\n\u201c Abraham Lincoln wrote that \u2018 I find that mercy bears richer fruit than strict justice , \u2019 \u201d Paul said . \u201c As a Christian , I think about that our religion talks about redemption and that maybe the law should give people second chances . I think about : \u2018 What is justice ? Should justice mean just punishment ? Is it rehabilitation ? \u2019 Ultimately I think that justice is about discernment and discretion . Just before Christmas this year , there was a great story that I read . This story came on the heels of stories that weren \u2019 t so good\u2014that made it seem as if \u2018 oh my goodness , we have to worry about the police not acting correctly. \u2019 But this story was heartwarming and I think it represents more of what the police do than the exceptions to the rule . \u201d\nThe story Paul was discussing was of Helen Johnson . \u201c In this story , just before Christmas , Helen Johnson went to get some eggs in Tarrant , Alabama , just north of Birmingham , \u201d Paul said . \u201c Her kids had been at home with her and her kids \u2019 kids had been at home with her and they hadn \u2019 t eaten in two days . She got to the store and she had $ 1.25 and was 50 cents short of buying her eggs . She made a fateful decision that day . She decided to steal the eggs . She put them in her pocket but she was caught before she left the store . \u201d\n\u201c The Tarrant police officer arrived on the scene , though , and something extraordinary happened . The Tarrant police office , I think , used discretion . He told her stealing was wrong , that she shouldn \u2019 t steal , and then he bought the eggs for her , \u201d he explained . \u201c Then in the next days and weeks , the Tarrant police force went to take food to her house . When people talk about community policing , this is the kind of stuff that doesn \u2019 t get reported . We do have to have police to stop violent criminals but we have to have some discretion and some discernment and some help . Every day , somewhere , some police are helping someone in a house with needs , or helping someone without food . But all we hear are the bad stories . I invited as my guests today two Tarrant police officers , chief Dennis Reno and Lieutenant Larry Rice . I \u2019 d like to recognize them . \u201d\nThe crowd gave a standing ovation for the two police officers Paul honored for their department \u2019 s charity and good will .\nWhen Paul shifted back into discussing the government shutdown in October 2013 , he noted how the Obama administration sent federal employees to the scenic overpass overlooking Mount Rushmore to put orange cones out\u2014more effort than if they just let it be\u2014and did the same to try to close the open-air World War II memorial .\n\u201c My favorite scene of the government shutdown was this : They decided to wrap the World War II monument , remember this ? \u201d Paul asked the crowd . They sent hundreds of workers out there and you have to believe they paid them overtime , right ? These people hadn \u2019 t worked in years probably , but they sent them out there to close the World War II monument . There is no entrance and there is no exit to the World War II monument . They had to send hundreds of people out there to wrap it with barricades . But I tell people when you want to remember the shutdown , if you want to remember an image of the shutdown , remember this : World War II veterans getting off their bus , cutting down the barricades and throwing them on the lawn at the White House . \u201d\nPaul said that what should be one of the positives that came out of the government shutdown was that full lists of \u201c unessential \u201d federal employees were drafted among Capitol Hill offices and across various agencies of the executive branch .\n\u201c During the shutdown , they sent us a note . I \u2019 m sure Sen. [ Richard ] Shelby [ Alabama \u2019 s senior senator , who introduced Paul ] got the same note , \u201d Paul said . \u201c The note said : \u2018 Which of your employees are essential and which of your employees are unessential ? \u2019 I said , my goodness , something good is going to come out of this . We \u2019 re going to have a lesson . We \u2019 re going to learn what part of government is essential and what part is unessential . \u201d\n\u201c So I said , call the IRS\u2014I want to see what the IRS says on their list : 90 percent unessential , \u201d he continued . \u201c I said , man we \u2019 re going to learn something here : What about the EPA ? 95 percent unessential . I said my goodness we \u2019 re going to finally discover that most of the government could disappear and no one would notice but then I figured out the truth . Nothing in Washington is as it seems . It turns out that if you are unessential , you don \u2019 t have to come to work but you still get paid . It turns out there are almost 100,000 federal workers who get paid over $ 100,000 a year and almost all of them are unessential . But here \u2019 s the sad truth to this : the government is so dysfunctional that it cost money to close it down . It costs more money to close your government than to keep it open . This is a sad state of affairs . My friends , it can \u2019 t go on forever . We \u2019 re borrowing a million dollars a minute . \u201d\nPaul detailed how even with the several congressional investigations after the shutdown revealed there \u2019 s widespread waste in government\u2014and with scandals like the Veterans Administration scandal\u2014there \u2019 s no way for any government officials to get fired in Washington .\n\u201c During the shutdown though they did some investigations and one of the House committees brought forward some EPA employees\u2014they found one woman who hired 17 relatives paying them to be interns , they found another woman selling cosmetics and vitamins from her computer , and they found another guy at the EPA watching porn six hours a day , \u201d Paul said . \u201c And you \u2019 re like , this is good right ? They found them and they fired them , right ? Come on . These are federal employees . You think you can fire a federal employee ? They all still work at the EPA . You remember the VA scandal ? People were dying while waiting in line and someone at the VA was changing the numbers to make it look as if no one was waiting in line but meanwhile people were dying . You think we fired them ? You can \u2019 t fire these people . Your government is so broken you can \u2019 t fire people who steal from you , and you can \u2019 t fire people who lie to you . You can \u2019 t fire people who are making up numbers while people are dying waiting in line . So we did pass a law\u2014we had to pass a law to fire the people at the VA . \u201d\n\u201c But this is the problem with your government . Your government has gotten so out of control that we \u2019 re not in charge , \u201d he said . \u201c The executive branch has become this enormous monster with tentacles into every aspect of your life and we can \u2019 t stop it . Even when we vote to stop it , the president continues in a lawless way . \u201d\nPaul specifically pointed to the story of John Beale , an EPA employee who hadn \u2019 t been to work for six months but was still getting paid\u2014someone the agency misled Congress about when approached about him . Beale is getting 32 months in federal prison for his crimes , but only was caught after an in-depth investigation that agency leadership officials didn \u2019 t cooperate with .\n\u201c When they were looking through the EPA rolls , though , the guy that is my favorite story\u2014the guy they found was named John Beale , \u201d Paul said . \u201c John Beale hadn \u2019 t been at work in six months . They looked and they found out he works at the EPA and he \u2019 s the right hand man to Gina McCarthy . You know what his specialty is ? Global warming . He hadn \u2019 t been at work in six months but he keeps getting these promotions and he keeps getting these great performance reviews . So they [ Congress ] asked his boss , they did something extraordinary by actually deciding to investigation , they asked his boss what about this John Beale\u2014he never shows up for work ? They were like : \u2018 He works for the CIA , also. \u2019 And they \u2019 re like , \u2018 Really ? The CIA and the EPA ? What a combination , I \u2019 ve never heard of that . \u2019 \u201d\n\u201c But then they did something extraordinary . They called the CIA and they said : \u2018 John who ? Never heard of him. \u2019 They finally did catch this guy . He owes you about a million bucks , good luck getting it back . But they want to get it back and he is going to go to jail , \u201d Paul explained . \u201c But after they caught him , Gina McCarthy\u2014the head of the EPA\u2014said she assumed he had left but nobody checked on it . Then he said he wanted retirement and he didn \u2019 t want to be fired , and she said that \u2019 s the compassionate thing to do because he \u2019 s only been stealing from us for about 11 years . So we \u2019 ll let him retire and not dishonor him . Then you know what , seven months later , know what they discovered ? He was still on the payroll . They had forgotten to force him into retirement . He was still collecting a check and he said he changed his mind and said \u2018 oh I think I \u2019 m not going to retire now. \u2019 He thought it could go on forever . This is the state of affairs of your government . It is absolutely and utterly out of control . \u201d\nPaul then ripped Obama\u2014and likely 2016 Democratic presidential candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2014for their misdeeds .\nWith Obama \u2019 s executive overreach\u2014a creeping trend that Paul said started over a hundred years ago in the country as the executive branch has slowly but surely attained more power than the legislative or judicial branches of the federal government\u2014Paul said it \u2019 s \u201c one thing after another . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s Obamacare , he just decided to amend it on his own , \u201d Paul said . \u201c It \u2019 s immigration law . He just decided to amend that on his own . It \u2019 s war powers\u2014we \u2019 ve been at war now for six months again in the Middle East but Congress never voted on it . The Constitution is specific : Only Congress can declare war , only Congress can initiate war . George Bush had us in two wars , but we voted on both times in going to war . President Obama ? Oh , Democracy is kind of messy . I \u2019 m not messing with that Democracy stuff . I \u2019 ve got a pen , I \u2019 ve got a phone . If Congress won \u2019 t do what I want , I \u2019 ll do what I please . That isn \u2019 t the American way . That \u2019 s not what our Founding Fathers had for us . We have a Constitution not to restrain the people , but to restrain the government . This is a fundamental principle what we are losing that we have to do something about . \u201d\nPaul listed off a series of Obama scandals , specifically noting Operation Fast and Furious , the IRS , the Veterans Administration , and the tapping of phones by the Justice Department . He compared the hodgepodge of scandal that \u2019 s torn the Obama administration apart to a nursery rhyme . \u201c I sort of think of the Old MacDonald rhyme , here a scandal there a scandal everywhere a scandal , \u201d Paul said . \u201c But the one that really hits me the hardest , when I really think what is really the thing that I \u2019 m most concerned about\u2014which is the scandal that goes to the bedrock of what we stand for and what the country should do ? It \u2019 s got to be the scandal of Benghazi . \u201d\nThe crowd applauded loudly yet again before laid out his case of why Benghazi is the biggest scandal of the Obama administration\u2014and Clinton \u2019 s political career .\n\u201c Benghazi is not about the talking points , \u201d Paul said . \u201c It \u2019 s not even about the response that night . The true story of Benghazi is about the nine months leading up to Benghazi . It \u2019 s about in February , six special forces people were being brought home . It \u2019 s about March , six more special forces people were being brought home . It \u2019 s about April , six more special forces being brought home . Why ? We don \u2019 t want the Libyans seeing any soldiers in uniforms with any guns . It \u2019 s not politically correct to think that we have to have defense of our personnel , because gosh the Freedom Fighters won in Libya so we should just walk around and let the freedom fighters just control the country . \u201d\n\u201c We get to April , and Ambassador [ Christopher ] Stevens puts in a formal request for a DC-3 . It \u2019 s a 50-year-old plane , but they wanted a plane to be able to fly around the country in case of an emergency , \u201d he explained . \u201c Hillary Clinton \u2019 s State Department denied . About three days after Hillary Clinton \u2019 s State Department denied the plane , you know what they approved ? They approved an electrical charging station for the embassy in Vienna . It appears they have a fleet of electrical cars there and they want to make sure the Europeans know how green we are so we are greening up the embassy . But then they discovered the plugs didn \u2019 t fit in the socket , so they had to spend another hundred grand on an electrical charging station but we don \u2019 t have enough money for a DC-3 for Libya ? \u201d\nPaul walked through how the rest of the summer leading up to the Sept. 11 , 2012 , terrorist attacks in Benghazi , Clinton \u2019 s State Department spent another \u201c hundred grand sending three comedians to India for the \u2018 Make Chai , Not War \u2019 tour , \u201d another approximately $ 650,000 on Facebook ads , $ 5 million on \u201c crystal glassware and ball ware for the embassies . \u201d\n\u201c We get to August and now Ambassador Stevens is pleading for help , pleading again and again for help\u2014there \u2019 s a sixteen-personnel team , security team , that \u2019 s all that \u2019 s left , \u201d Paul said . \u201c That \u2019 s all that \u2019 s between them and the jihadists . Col. [ Andy ] Wood is the leader of this . They [ the Americans in Libya , led by Stevens ] sent missive after missive , cable after cable to Hillary Clinton . They were ignored . When she came before my committee , I asked her : \u2018 Secretary Clinton , did you read the cables ? \u2019 She kind of brushed me off as if \u2018 who am I ? You think I would read the cables ? \u2019 Well , maybe . It \u2019 s one of the five most dangerous countries in the world and you \u2019 re not reading the cables where the ambassador is directly appealing for help ? She never had time . \u201d\nPaul noted there has been no consequences as of yet for Clinton or any of her subordinates for their role in what happened in Benghazi\u2014but Americans can stop her from becoming president now .\n\u201c No one was ever punished for this , \u201d Paul said . \u201c Four state department [ officials ] were transferred to other jobs . We kept calling them trying to get one of them to answer the phone but of course they were probably \u2018 unessential \u2019 \u2014getting paid [ while being ] somewhere else . [ Secretary of State John ] Kerry finally forgave them all . No one was punished for Benghazi . For nine months security was requested and denied . What I say to Hillary Clinton I \u2019 ll say again tonight : If you \u2019 re not going to defend the troops , if you \u2019 re not going to defend our embassies , if you have shown that you are derelict in your duty to provide security for the United States , you should forever preclude yourself from running for the presidency . \u201d",

Raise your hand if you\u2019ve spent more than you bring in chronically for the last 10, 20 or 30 years.\u201d\n\nNo hands went up in the entire audience.\n\n\u201cNobody does that,\u201d Paul said. \u201cEveryone balances their family budget. They think we\u2019re extremists. Somebody said \u2018oh this is extreme.\u2019 And I said, \u2018to balance the budget, to only spend what comes in, is extreme?\u2019\u201d\n\nPaul had opened his speech by quoting President Abraham Lincoln when it comes to matters of justice\u2014using it to transition into an example of local police officers in Tarrant, Alabama, doing something terrific for a woman in need right before Christmas.\n\n\u201cAbraham Lincoln wrote that \u2018I find that mercy bears richer fruit than strict justice,\u2019\u201d Paul said. \u201cAs a Christian, I think about that our religion talks about redemption and that maybe the law should give people second chances.

[Richard] Shelby [Alabama\u2019s senior senator, who introduced Paul] got the same note,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThe note said: \u2018Which of your employees are essential and which of your employees are unessential?\u2019 I said, my goodness, something good is going to come out of this. We\u2019re going to have a lesson.

Beale is getting 32 months in federal prison for his crimes, but only was caught after an in-depth investigation that agency leadership officials didn\u2019t cooperate with.\n\n\u201cWhen they were looking through the EPA rolls, though, the guy that is my favorite story\u2014the guy they found was named John Beale,\u201d Paul said. \u201cJohn Beale hadn\u2019t been at work in six months. They looked and they found out he works at the EPA and he\u2019s the right hand man to Gina McCarthy. You know what his specialty is? Global warming. He hadn\u2019t been at work in six months but he keeps getting these promotions and he keeps getting these great performance reviews. So they [Congress] asked his boss, they did something extraordinary by actually deciding to investigation, they asked his boss what about this John Beale\u2014he never shows up for work? They were like: \u2018He works for the CIA, also.\u2019 And they\u2019re like, \u2018Really? The CIA and the EPA? What a combination, I\u2019ve never heard of that.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cBut then they did something extraordinary. They called the CIA and they said: \u2018John who? Never heard of him.\u2019 They finally did catch this guy. He owes you about a million bucks, good luck getting it back. But they want to get it back and he is going to go to jail,\u201d Paul explained. \u201cBut after they caught him, Gina McCarthy\u2014the head of the EPA\u2014said she assumed he had left but nobody checked on it. Then he said he wanted retirement and he didn\u2019t want to be fired, and she said that\u2019s the compassionate thing to do because he\u2019s only been stealing from us for about 11 years. So we\u2019ll let him retire and not dishonor him. Then you know what, seven months later, know what they discovered? He was still on the payroll. They had forgotten to force him into retirement. He was still collecting a check and he said he changed his mind and said \u2018oh I think I\u2019m not going to retire now.\u2019 He thought it could go on forever. This is the state of affairs of your government. It is absolutely and utterly out of control.\u201d\n\nPaul then ripped Obama\u2014and likely 2016 Democratic presidential candidate former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2014for their misdeeds.\n\nWith Obama\u2019s executive overreach\u2014a creeping trend that Paul said started over a hundred years ago in the country as the executive branch has slowly but surely attained more power than the legislative or judicial branches of the federal government\u2014Paul said it\u2019s \u201cone thing after another.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Obamacare, he just decided to amend it on his own,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIt\u2019s immigration law. He just decided to amend that on his own. It\u2019s war powers\u2014we\u2019ve been at war now for six months again in the Middle East but Congress never voted on it. The Constitution is specific: Only Congress can declare war, only Congress can initiate war. George Bush had us in two wars, but we voted on both times in going to war. President Obama? Oh, Democracy is kind of messy. I\u2019m not messing with that Democracy stuff. I\u2019ve got a pen, I\u2019ve got a phone. If Congress won\u2019t do what I want, I\u2019ll do what I please. That isn\u2019t the American way. That\u2019s not what our Founding Fathers had for us. We have a Constitution not to restrain the people, but to restrain the government. This is a fundamental principle what we are losing that we have to do something about.\u201d\n\nPaul listed off a series of Obama scandals, specifically noting Operation Fast and Furious, the IRS, the Veterans Administration, and the tapping of phones by the Justice Department. He compared the hodgepodge of scandal that\u2019s torn the Obama administration apart to a nursery rhyme. \u201cI sort of think of the Old MacDonald rhyme, here a scandal there a scandal everywhere a scandal,\u201d Paul said. \u201cBut the one that really hits me the hardest, when I really think what is really the thing that I\u2019m most concerned about\u2014which is the scandal that goes to the bedrock of what we stand for and what the country should do? It\u2019s got to be the scandal of Benghazi.\u201d\n\nThe crowd applauded loudly yet again before laid out his case of why Benghazi is the biggest scandal of the Obama administration\u2014and Clinton\u2019s political career.\n\n\u201cBenghazi is not about the talking points,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIt\u2019s not even about the response that night. The true story of Benghazi is about the nine months leading up to Benghazi. It\u2019s about in February, six special forces people were being brought home. It\u2019s about March, six more special forces people were being brought home. It\u2019s about April, six more special forces being brought home. Why? We don\u2019t want the Libyans seeing any soldiers in uniforms with any guns. It\u2019s not politically correct to think that we have to have defense of our personnel, because gosh the Freedom Fighters won in Libya so we should just walk around and let the freedom fighters just control the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe get to April, and Ambassador [Christopher] Stevens puts in a formal request for a DC-3. It\u2019s a 50-year-old plane, but they wanted a plane to be able to fly around the country in case of an emergency,\u201d he explained. \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s State Department denied. About three days after Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department denied the plane, you know what they approved? They approved an electrical charging station for the embassy in Vienna. It appears they have a fleet of electrical cars there and they want to make sure the Europeans know how green we are so we are greening up the embassy. But then they discovered the plugs didn\u2019t fit in the socket, so they had to spend another hundred grand on an electrical charging station but we don\u2019t have enough money for a DC-3 for Libya?\u201d\n\nPaul walked through how the rest of the summer leading up to the Sept. 11, 2012, terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Clinton\u2019s State Department spent another \u201chundred grand sending three comedians to India for the \u2018Make Chai, Not War\u2019 tour,\u201d another approximately $650,000 on Facebook ads, $5 million on \u201ccrystal glassware and ball ware for the embassies.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe get to August and now Ambassador Stevens is pleading for help, pleading again and again for help\u2014there\u2019s a sixteen-personnel team, security team, that\u2019s all that\u2019s left,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThat\u2019s all that\u2019s between them and the jihadists. Col. [Andy] Wood is the leader of this. They [the Americans in Libya, led by Stevens] sent missive after missive, cable after cable to Hillary Clinton. They were ignored. When she came before my committee, I asked her: \u2018Secretary Clinton, did you read the cables?\u2019 She kind of brushed me off as if \u2018who am I? You think I would read the cables?\u2019 Well, maybe. It\u2019s one of the five most dangerous countries in the world and you\u2019re not reading the cables where the ambassador is directly appealing for help? She never had time.\u201d\n\nPaul noted there has been no consequences as of yet for Clinton or any of her subordinates for their role in what happened in Benghazi\u2014but Americans can stop her from becoming president now.\n\n\u201cNo one was ever punished for this,\u201d Paul said. \u201cFour state department [officials] were transferred to other jobs. We kept calling them trying to get one of them to answer the phone but of course they were probably \u2018unessential\u2019\u2014getting paid [while being] somewhere else. [Secretary of State John] Kerry finally forgave them all. No one was punished for Benghazi. For nine months security was requested and denied. What I say to Hillary Clinton I\u2019ll say again tonight: If you\u2019re not going to defend the troops, if you\u2019re not going to defend our embassies, if you have shown that you are derelict in your duty to provide security for the United States, you should forever preclude yourself from running for the presidency.\u201d",
