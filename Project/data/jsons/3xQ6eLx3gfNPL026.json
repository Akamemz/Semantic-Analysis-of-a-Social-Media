    "content": "Less than a month after Donald Trump was improbably elected the 45th president of the United States , a strange story began to make its way across social media . In the quaint days before Russia \u2019 s dissemination of fake-news stories in the interest of facilitating Trump \u2019 s victory became front-page news , a 28-year-old named Edgar Maddison Welch began reading about a pizzeria in Washington , D.C. , that housed young children as sex slaves in a devilish operation masterminded by the recently vanquished Democratic candidate for president , Hillary Clinton . So Welch decided to drive the six or so hours up from his home in Salisbury , North Carolina , to Comet Ping Pong in northwest D.C. , where he opened fire with an AR-15 .\nThe Comet Ping Pong story , and the even more disturbing news of the Kremlin \u2019 s role in our election , merely underscore fake news \u2019 s rapid ascent from an amorphous notion to perhaps the most significant digital epidemic facing the media , government , and , at the risk of sounding mildly hysterical , democracy itself . One Pakistani military offender , confused by a fake-news story , raised the prospect of a nuclear war with Israel . ( Recall that Michael Flynn Jr. , the son of Trump \u2019 s national security adviser , shared the Comet Ping Pong story on Twitter . ) Meanwhile , our current president spent virtually his entire campaign inventing or proliferating fabricated stories such as his suggestion that Ted Cruz \u2019 s father was involved in the plot to assassinate John F. Kennedy ( he wasn \u2019 t ) and his pronouncement that violent crime was at an all-time high in the U.S. ( crimes rates , while rising slightly in the last year , are near a 20-year low ) . While all of these stories were obviously fabricated in various ways , they did share one technological commonality : they were almost entirely text-based . And that is about to change .\nAt corporations and universities across the country , incipient technologies appear likely to soon obliterate the line between real and fake . Or , in the simplest of terms , advancements in audio and video technology are becoming so sophisticated that they will be able to replicate real news\u2014real TV broadcasts , for instance , or radio interviews\u2014in unprecedented , and truly indecipherable , ways . One research paper published last year by professors at Stanford University and the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg demonstrated how technologists can record video of someone talking and then change their facial expressions in real time .
