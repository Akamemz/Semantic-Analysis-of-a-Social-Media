    "content": "The results in Nevada will likely have a meaningful effect on the overall race for the Democratic presidential nomination . Coming into Saturday , Sen. Bernie Sanders is a strong favorite to win Nevada \u2014 \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s forecast gives him about a 6 in 7 chance of finishing first there . But how much he wins by \u2014 or whether he wins at all \u2014 will also affect what the race looks like coming out of the Silver State . Although Sanders is favored , there \u2019 s still a chance that someone else wins Nevada \u2014 not only does our forecast have him losing in about 1 out of every 7 simulations , but Wednesday \u2019 s debate hasn \u2019 t been fully factored into the polls yet , which in turn means it hasn \u2019 t been fully factored into our model . In other words , don \u2019 t be completely surprised if there \u2019 s a surprise on Saturday .\nSo how might different outcomes in Nevada change each candidate \u2019 s chances of winning the nomination ? To find out , let \u2019 s run through the scenarios that pop up at least 1 percent of the time in our model ( so at least 100 times in 10,000 forecast simulations ) .\nFirst up , let \u2019 s examine how the forecast would shift based on who wins and by what margin . The most likely outcome in Nevada is that Sanders wins by a \u201c large \u201d margin ( more than 12 percentage points ) followed by a \u201c medium \u201d win for Sanders ( by between 4 and 12 points ) . But there are other scenarios in which Sanders wins by a \u201c narrow \u201d margin ( fewer than 4 points ) or another candidate \u2014 former Vice President Joe Biden , Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former South Bend , Indiana , Mayor Pete Buttigieg \u2014 wins by varying margins . So here \u2019 s how our overall forecast would shift in response to these outcomes :\nHow Nevada could affect the nomination odds , Part I Chances of winning a majority of all pledged delegates based on winner and margin of victory in Nevada , according to \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s forecast CHANCE OF WINNING MAJORITY OF DELEGATES OVERALL Winner NV Margin Sanders Biden Bloom .

Scenarios are only listed if they had at least a 1 percent chance of occurring .\nThe model has basically priced in a medium victory for Sanders in Nevada , so that result wouldn \u2019 t greatly increase or decrease his chances of winning a majority of pledged delegates . But a large win for Sanders could propel him closer to the 50 percent mark in our forecast . And he might be able to pull off a win by those margins \u2014 not only is he polling well in Nevada , but also the rest of the field is crowded together far below him in the polls . Five candidates are clustered between 9 and 15 percent in \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Nevada polling average , well behind Sanders \u2019 s 27 percent . Still , if Sanders only wins by a narrow margin , that would actually decrease his likelihood of winning a delegate majority by more than a few points .\nIt \u2019 s less likely that Biden , Buttigieg or Warren will win , but in model runs where that happened , the main takeaway is that most of those scenarios would increase the chances that no one wins a majority of pledged delegates . Notably , Biden is the only one of those three candidates whose chances of winning a majority of pledged delegates nationwide might surpass Sanders \u2019 s in our forecast with a Nevada victory .\nBut let \u2019 s add one more layer of complication . While Sanders has a hefty lead in Nevada and is easily the most likely candidate to win , a bunch of other candidates are in the mix for second place . Although the second-place result won \u2019 t dramatically shift the overall forecast , let \u2019 s see how different combinations of margin of victory and second-place finisher affect each candidate \u2019 s odds . Here are the 17 scenarios that popped up at least 1 percent of the time :\nHow Nevada could affect the nomination odds , Part II Chances of winning a majority of all pledged delegates based on winner , margin of victory and second-place finisher in Nevada , according to \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s forecast CHANCE OF WINNING MAJORITY OF DELEGATES OVERALL Winner NV margin 2nd Sanders Biden Bloom .

Scenarios are only listed if they had at least a 1 percent chance of occurring .\nThe most likely candidate to get second is Buttigieg , but regardless of the margin , finishing runner-up doesn \u2019 t notably alter his chances of winning a delegate majority . Outside of winning , Biden \u2019 s chances only notably improve if he can finish just behind Sanders in Nevada . If anything , another underwhelming performance for Biden could be one too many , and his South Carolina \u201c firewall \u201d might crumble . Outside of Biden , most other candidates wouldn \u2019 t see much movement in their overall chances if they finished second or worse . Even for candidates like Sen. Amy Klobuchar or billionaire activist Tom Steyer , a runner-up finish wouldn \u2019 t raise their chances of winning a delegate majority above the 1 percent mark .\nOne candidate we haven \u2019 t mentioned yet is former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg , but we include him in both tables above . He \u2019 s not an option for Nevada voters , but the outcomes we \u2019 ve covered have a marginal impact on his chances . He had a 9 percent shot at winning a majority of pledged delegates going into Nevada , so the worst outcome for Bloomberg would be a Biden win , since that could help Biden win back some of the support he \u2019 s lost to Bloomberg . Two results stick out as the best possible outcomes for Bloomberg in the two tables above . First , a narrow Warren victory , as shown in the first table , could move some progressive voters toward her at Sanders \u2019 s expense and make it less likely that Sanders can win a majority of pledged delegates . But even a \u201c medium \u201d second-place finish for Steyer , as shown in the second table , would also help Bloomberg \u2019 s chances while lowering Sanders \u2019 s odds , perhaps because the moderate alternatives to Bloomberg would be greatly weakened by finishing outside the top two .\nBefore we finish , we need to cover the important caveats and complications to keep in mind when looking at the Nevada results and how they affect our forecast .\nFirst , the \u2588\u2588\u2588 model is looking at the popular vote in Nevada after realignment . That is , if a candidate doesn \u2019 t have enough support to meet a viability threshold at a caucus site ( usually 15 percent of voters at a given caucus site , counting people who voted early ) , that candidate \u2019 s supporters are given a chance to move to a viable choice . ( Candidates who don \u2019 t clear the threshold after this second alignment aren \u2019 t eligible to receive delegates . ) But don \u2019 t forget about early voters , who might make up a huge share of Nevada caucusgoers . Early voters had to rank at least three candidates , so if their first choice isn \u2019 t viable , they will be automatically realigned to the next candidate on their ranked-choice ballot who is viable . Yet Nevada Democrats don \u2019 t use the popular vote to determine who wins national delegates \u2014 instead , they use the number of county convention delegates awarded to each candidate at the precinct caucuses . If this sounds weirdly familiar , it should : The Iowa caucuses used a similar process where state delegate equivalents determined national delegate allocation .\nSo just as Buttigieg got partial credit for a win in Iowa because he narrowly won the state delegate equivalent count ( which could change after a recount ) even though Sanders won the final-alignment popular vote in Iowa , there could be a split decision in Nevada , too . This is important because it could affect how the media covers the race , which in turn affects the sort of bounce a candidate receives from a win ( though , historically , the Nevada bounce is much smaller than Iowa \u2019 s ) . Because county delegates are what matters for national delegate allocation , that \u2019 s what media organizations will predominantly use to call a winner , so if there \u2019 s a split outcome , the county delegate winner might get top billing . Of course , the Iowa race didn \u2019 t have nearly as strong a favorite as Nevada does \u2014 our model didn \u2019 t give any candidate better than a 41 percent chance of winning , far below the 85 percent chance that Sanders has of finishing first in Nevada . But the split-decision possibility and how it could be covered is something to keep in mind .\nMore generally , we can \u2019 t predict how the media will cover the results , even if Sanders wins as expected . Media reactions are pretty important to determining just how much of a bounce a candidate gets from winning or performing better than expected , so it \u2019 s possible that a candidate who finishes a strong second \u2014 or third , if the reaction to Klobuchar \u2019 s New Hampshire result is any indication \u2014 might get a lot more coverage than we might otherwise expect . The \u2588\u2588\u2588 model is trying to make educated guesses about how the results will be received , but the only way to know for sure is to wait and see what the polls say after Nevada votes , which the model will quickly adjust for once we get enough survey data .",
