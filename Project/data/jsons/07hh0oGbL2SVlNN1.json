    "content": "North Korea just successfully tested an intercontinental ballistic missile , one of its most audacious moves yet \u2014 and a vivid reminder that Pyongyang seems determined to test whether President Donald Trump is willing to turn his tough talk about the country \u2019 s nuclear threat into action .\nThe Hwasong-14 flew for 37 minutes , according to US Pacific Command , and traveled about 578 miles . It didn \u2019 t go as far as it could because it was shot at a high trajectory , likely to ensure it didn \u2019 t make another country believe it was being attacked . The projectile eventually landed in the sea between Japan and North Korea , but analysts believe it could have traveled as far as 4,200 miles if it had been fired with an actual intent to strike a target in case of conflict .\nIn response , the US and South Korea held a military exercise within 10 miles of the demilitarized zone that separates North Korea from its neighbor . Meanwhile , Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called for \u201c global action \u201d to counter North Korea , while China and Russia asked for a \u201c double suspension \u201d of the military exercise and North Korea \u2019 s weapons program .\nBased on the global reaction , the missile test was clearly a big deal . That \u2019 s because another of the caveats about North Korea \u2014 primarily that it didn \u2019 t have an intercontinental ballistic missile , or ICBM , that could hit the mainland United States \u2014 are steadily disappearing . \u201c That range would not be enough to reach the lower 48 states or the large islands of Hawaii , but would allow it to reach all of Alaska , \u201d wrote David Wright , co-director of the Union of Concerned Scientists .\nAnd , down the line , this test could be seen as a stepping stone to an even more threatening development . \u201c Even if this is a 7,000-km-range missile , a 10,000-km-range missile that can hit New York isn \u2019 t far off , \u201d Jeffrey Lewis , director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies , told the New York Times .\nWhat \u2019 s still not clear is if North Korea has the ability to miniaturize a nuclear weapon so it could be placed on the tip of the missile , and , even if it can , if the missile could reach the US and still detonate . However , Lewis told me in April that North Korea was only about five years away from being able to do that .\nBack in January , North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said that his country was close to testing an ICBM .
