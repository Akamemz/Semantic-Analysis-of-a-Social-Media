The California case was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of the Sierra Club and Southern Border Communities Coalition .\nU.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden , a Trump appointee , wrote that the House 's lawsuit was `` about whether one chamber of Congress has the 'constitutional means ' to conscript the Judiciary in a political turf war with the President over the implementation of legislation . ''\nMcFadden said Congress did n't have authority in this case but that he did n't mean to imply the legislative body could never challenge the president in court over separation of powers .\n`` An old maxim in politics holds that , 'Where you stand depends on where you sit , ' '' he wrote . `` At law too , whether a plaintiff has standing often depends on where he sits . A seat in Congress comes with many prerogatives , but legal standing to superintend the execution of laws is not among them . ''\nThe Justice Department welcomed the decision , saying the judge `` rightly ruled that the House of Representatives can not ask the judiciary to take its side in political disputes and can not use federal courts to accomplish through litigation what it can not achieve using the tools the Constitution gives to Congress .

The administration plans to appeal the ruling by Haywood Gilliam Jr. , an appointee of President Barack Obama .\nAt stake is billions of dollars that would allow Trump to make progress on a signature campaign promise heading into his bid for a second term .
