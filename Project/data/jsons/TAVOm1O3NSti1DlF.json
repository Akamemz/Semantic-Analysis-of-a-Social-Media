    "content": "How did Donald Trump do in his first 100 days as US president ? The moment you step out into the beating heart of America , you realize that \u2019 s the wrong question .\nHow did the Donald Trumps \u2013 plural \u2013 do in their first 100 days ? That \u2019 s the better line of inquiry . And no , it \u2019 s not a reference to Donald Jr , busily engorging the family business while his father makes America great again .\nThe question to ask is : how did the two Donald Trumps do ? One man , two entirely contrary public figures . There \u2019 s Donald Trump , champion of the white conservative religious masses of rural and small-town America , the man bringing change to Washington , reviving the nation \u2019 s pride , teaching a lesson to foreigners with a well-targeted bombing raid or two .\nAnd then there \u2019 s Donald Trump as seen through the eyes of urban America , minority communities and progressive voters . This president is utterly incompetent , criminally corrupt , or both , is only interested in himself and his rich buddies , and has turned the White House into a reality TV show .\nIt \u2019 s not hard to track down people who subscribe to one of these Donald Trumps . There are millions of them , scattered unevenly across the United States .\nIn some places , the polar impressions co-exist side by side in their own hermetically sealed bubbles . Like in Ohio , where two neighboring communities straddling a county line have been following the progress of quite different Donald Trumps since the inauguration on 20 January . .\nTo the west of the county border is Warrensville Heights , a city of 14,000 people that is 94 % African American . It lies on the outskirts of Cleveland in Cuyahoga County , one of the key strongholds in this crucial swing state for Hillary Clinton , with 66 % of the county voting for her on election day .\nTo the east of the boundary is Chardon , in Geauga County , where a commanding 61 % voted for Trump . Chardon \u2019 s 5,000 residents are as white as Warrensville Heights \u2019 are black , even more so in fact , with the 2010 census recording a 98 % white population . \u201c We \u2019 re Anglo-Saxon , God-fearing Republicans , \u201d as one resident put it .\nTwenty miles and that county line between them . But when it comes to the 45th president , it \u2019 s as though these two communities are seeing him through alternate realities .\nWe invited residents of Warrensville Heights , who voted Democratic in the presidential election , to tell us the word that came into their minds when they heard the phrase : \u201c Donald Trump \u2019 s first 100 days \u201d .\nThen we put it to Trump voters in Chardon . They said :\nSo what did they mean ? Why , for instance , did Kim Williams , 47 , an African American woman who works at a loans and lottery company , Cash2Go , in Warrensville Heights , say \u201c stress \u201d when Trump \u2019 s 100 days was evoked ?\nBold ? Look at what he \u2019 s done . I think he \u2019 s doing what \u2019 s best for America Ward Lawrence , salesman\n\u201c I say \u2018 stress \u2019 down to how he \u2019 s handling things for the people , \u201d she said . \u201c Truthfully , I think he \u2019 s a puppet for rich folk . \u201d\nShe checked off Trump \u2019 s travel ban for visitors from Muslim-majority countries , his deportations of non-criminal Latino immigrants , and his failed attempt to scrap the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) as evidence of his discrimination against minorities and in favour of the wealthy . Then she used a vivid metaphor to describe how she believes the president has been duping the American people .\n\u201c He offers us with real nice food \u2013 steak and fries \u2013 but when he comes to give it to you it \u2019 s presented on a trashcan lid . \u201d\nBy similar measure , why did Ward Lawrence , 81 , a white salesman in Chardon , come up with \u201c bold \u201d when given the Trump test ? A clue perhaps was that he \u2019 d just spent three hours listening to Rush Limbaugh \u2019 s rightwing talk radio show .\n\u201c Bold ? Look at what he \u2019 s done . I think he \u2019 s doing what \u2019 s best for America \u2026 the Keystone pipeline , he threw out Environmental Protection Agency regulations , he told companies not to move jobs out of the country . \u201d\nNo worries about climate change ? \u201c That \u2019 s a fabrication , \u201d he said . \u201c Entirely made up by people who benefit financially from it , starting with Al Gore . \u201d\nLawrence has no doubt that 97 % of Chardon \u2013 his figure \u2013 would vote for Trump again . \u201c Oh yes , absolutely. \u201d And he , too , has a ripe metaphor for why that should be so . \u201c We suffered for eight years kissing Obama \u2019 s ass because he was black . Now Trump says it like it is . \u201d\nTrump expended much of his energy on the campaign trail last year , and a good deal of it since he entered the White House , talking about his devotion to the \u201c forgotten \u201d people . That was barely concealed code for white working-class and middle-class Americans .\nThe strange thing about Ohio is that the equation is reversed . If anyone has been forgotten in these neighboring communities , it is the poor black inhabitants of Warrenville Heights .\nThe area around Jack Racino , a horse racing and gambling casino in the center of the city , has a desolation epitomised by the local super mall that has closed and is being razed to rubble . Letters from its welcome sign , Randall Park , lie in great plastic shards in puddles of oily water where a couple of geese paddle forlornly .\nLife is tough enough for the residents of the \u201c friendly city \u201d , as Warrensville Heights styles itself . Median income for a household is $ 33,000 , compared with $ 54,000 in white Chardon . Infant mortality rates in Cuyahoga County are 11 deaths per 1,000 live births , twice the national average .\nDespite such hardship , Trump is proposing to make life worse for the folk of Warrensville Heights . It \u2019 s not just his ongoing efforts to scrap the ACA , also known as Obamacare , which would disproportionately impact poor families .\nHe is also attempting in next year \u2019 s budget to cut back on meals for wheels services for elderly people , and free transport for them to hospitals . That \u2019 s why Gregory Gaines , 49 , a building worker whose mother-in-law is dependent on such assistance , thought of the word \u201c horrible \u201d to sum up Trump \u2019 s 100 days .\n\u201c Trump \u2019 s ethics aren \u2019 t right , \u201d he said . \u201c His thinking seems to be to take from those who have not , to give to those who have . \u201d\nBut the president says he is on the side of the forgotten people . \u201c Forgotten people ? \u201d Gaines guffawed . \u201c We are the forgotten people . I \u2019 ve yet to see him do anything for the black community . \u201d\nKay , 58 , who runs a school for hair and nail beauty stylists , chose the word \u201c clown \u201d . She said : \u201c I believe Trump \u2019 s so used to being on TV that \u2019 s how he \u2019 s running the country like a reality show . He says things he knows aren \u2019 t true , like the crowd size at his inauguration , but wears a mask that makes him look as though it \u2019 s true . \u201d\nKay said she thought the assault on funding for the women \u2019 s health network Planned Parenthood was especially reprehensible . She was derisive also about the senior White House team , namely adviser Kellyanne Conway and press secretary Sean Spicer \u2013 \u201c they talk about fake news , but I heard more fake news from them than anybody \u201d \u2013 and daughter Ivanka \u2013 \u201c could I get a job description , maybe ? \u201d\nAcross the road , Darius Smith , 29 , responded to the Trump test with the word \u201c money \u201d . He gave a simple reason : \u201c I think Donald Trump bought his way into the White House . \u201d\nSmith is a gold buyer , which sounds more glamorous than it is . Local residents bring their broken jewelry to him to pawn or sell . A glass showcase in the store is entirely bare , while Smith works at a counter behind iron security bars .\nLike most others in Warrensville Heights , he voted twice for Obama before backing Clinton in November . So how does he think Donald Trump has done in his first 100 days ? \u201c He hasn \u2019 t done anything yet . The travel ban didn \u2019 t go through , and that was a horrible idea . \u201d\nAfter a half-hour \u2019 s drive to Chardon , the outlook switches dramatically . There \u2019 s nothing forgotten about the town \u2019 s quaint square , with its pretty redbrick courthouse dating from 1869 , or the well-appointed shops serving the surrounding area \u2019 s prosperous farming community .\nStalls are going up for the 88th annual maple festival this weekend , with bumper cars , a haunted house and \u201c old-fashioned \u201d lemonade and hot dog stands . It takes little imagination to get the size of a place that proclaims on its official placard : \u201c Chardon \u2019 s square and proud of it \u201d .\nHere in all-white Chardon , Donald Trump has metamorphosed into action man .\n\u201c Action \u201d was the word conjured up by Tim Overberger , 47 , a carpet installer shopping in the square . Wasn \u2019 t that quite a glowing review to give a president whose key policy efforts have come unstuck at the hands of the courts or his fellow Republicans in Congress ?\n\u201c I think he \u2019 s done stuff , \u201d Overberger protested , though he was hard-pressed to provide details . \u201c He \u2019 s signed some bills , though I don \u2019 t pay attention to that small stuff . He said he was going to bomb , and he did . \u201d\nHis thinking seems to be to take from those who have not , to give to those who have Gregory Gaines , building worker\nEd , 71 , a car mechanic , used the word \u201c fast \u201d to describe what he thought had been a highly productive start to Trump \u2019 s term in office . \u201c I like the fact that he \u2019 s sticking it to these other countries , like North Korea . At least he \u2019 s doing something . \u201d\nJeanne Lose , 56 , is that rare animal in Chardon , a resident who is not a dyed-in-the-wool Republican .

The two Donald Trumps stayed doggedly in their respective bubbles , with virtually no common ground between them . Was there no hope of any communion after these first 100 days , no coming together of any description ?\nIn Chardon , the only Trump voter to give an inch was Caroline Mansfield , 53 , chief deputy at the Geauga county treasurer \u2019 s office . \u201c Filter \u201d was the word that came into her mind , because she said the president could sometimes do with using one to moderate his public comments .\nShe also conceded that Trump had found it very hard in his rookie days to achieve his objectives .

The jury is still out Read more\nThe only person truly prepared to cross the metaphorical county line between Trump and anti-Trump sentiments aptly chose the word \u201c surprising \u201d . Kendell Long , 27 , walking home in Warrensville Heights with his three-year-old son , Kendell Jr , said he was finding the new president hard to pin down .\nAt first , everything Trump said or did horrified him . He hated the damage the president \u2019 s cuts would do to public services , such as Cleveland \u2019 s world-class hospitals , and he loathed his intemperate outbursts on Twitter or TV . \u201c There seemed like there was no control to what came out of his mouth . \u201d\nBut over time Long , who studies psychology at night while holding down a day job at a Valvoline instant oil change franchise , was forced to reappraise , he said . \u201c I think Trump \u2019 s starting to think through what he says and does , way more than when he was running . \u201d\nDidn \u2019 t he worry about how his peers would respond if he stood up , even just a little , for the president ? \u201c I don \u2019 t care about what someone else feels , I only care about what \u2019 s good for me and my son , \u201d he said , holding Kendell Jr in his arms . \u201c As long as Trump \u2019 s not bringing trouble down on us , like wars and stuff , he \u2019 s not always such a bad thing . \u201d",

He hated the damage the president\u2019s cuts would do to public services, such as Cleveland\u2019s world-class hospitals, and he loathed his intemperate outbursts on Twitter or TV. \u201cThere seemed like there was no control to what came out of his mouth.\u201d\n\nBut over time Long, who studies psychology at night while holding down a day job at a Valvoline instant oil change franchise, was forced to reappraise, he said. \u201cI think Trump\u2019s starting to think through what he says and does, way more than when he was running.\u201d\n\nDidn\u2019t he worry about how his peers would respond if he stood up, even just a little, for the president? \u201cI don\u2019t care about what someone else feels, I only care about what\u2019s good for me and my son,\u201d he said, holding Kendell Jr in his arms. \u201cAs long as Trump\u2019s not bringing trouble down on us, like wars and stuff, he\u2019s not always such a bad thing.\u201d",
