Given the high public interest , the court is modifying its usual policy and will release audio of the session soon after its conclusion .\nThe controversy pits an administration that considers the restrictions necessary for Americans ' security against challengers who claim it is illegally aimed at Muslims -- and stems from Trump 's campaign call for a `` total and complete shutdown of Muslims '' entering the U.S .\nThe case will be the first significant legal test so far of the president 's administration and could lead to a precedent-setting ruling on the limits of executive power , especially within the immigration context .\n`` This is a very difficult issue for the Supreme Court , '' said Thomas Dupree , a former top Bush Justice Department official . `` In many ways , it 's a political judgment -- who is allowed into this country -- and historically the court has been very reluctant to tread into areas where it could be viewed as making a political judgment that is properly confined to the executive . ''\nAttention on Gorsuch is heightened after a surprise ruling last week . Trump 's appointee to the high court has been a reliable conservative in his first year on the bench but last week ruled against the administration in a separate immigration case involving government efforts to deport foreigners convicted of serious crimes in the U.S .\nGorsuch in that dispute sided with the court 's four more liberal members , the first time that has happened in his tenure on the job . He has given no indication how he would vote in the travel ban issue .\nIn this case , the justices have allowed the current restrictions -- known as travel ban 3.0 -- to be enforced at the Justice Department 's request , at least until the case is fully litigated .\nFederal appeals courts in Virginia and California in recent months had ruled against the administration . The San Francisco-based 9th Circuit court last December concluded Trump 's proclamation , like the two previous executive orders , overstepped his powers to regulate the entry of aliens .\nIt `` fails to provide a rationale explaining why permitting entry of nationals from the six designated countries under current protocols would be detrimental to the interests of the United States , '' wrote the appeals judges .\nThe White House , on the other hand , has framed the issue as a temporary move involving national security . A coalition of groups in opposition call the order blatant religious discrimination , since the six countries involved have mostly Muslim populations : Iran , Libya , Somalia , Sudan , Syria and Yemen .\nA major sticking point for the justices will be navigating how much discretion the president really has over immigration . Courts have historically been deferential in this area , and recent presidents from Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama have used it to deny entry to certain refugees and diplomats , including nations such as Iran , Cuba and North Korea .\nA 1952 federal law -- the Immigration and Nationality Act , passed in the midst of a Cold War fear over Communist influence -- historically gives the chief executive broad authority .\nIt reads in part : `` Whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States , he may , may by proclamation , and for such period as he shall deem necessary , suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants , or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate . ''\nThe administration strongly denies this is a `` Muslim ban , '' but federal judges across the country cited statements by then-presidential candidate Trump and his advisers , including a December 2015 campaign press release calling for such restrictions , citing `` hatred '' by `` large segments of the Muslim population . ''\nIn its legal brief to the high court , the Justice Department downplayed the impact of remarks made by a candidate for high office .\n`` Impugning the official objective of a formal national security and foreign policy judgment of the president based on campaign trail statements is inappropriate and fraught with intractable difficulties , '' wrote the department 's Solicitor General Noel Francisco .\nSixteen state leaders led by Texas are among a number of coalitions backing the Trump administration .\nBut Hawaii officials , who filed the appeal contesting all of the president 's orders , say the president 's policies continue to violate the Constitution 's guarantee of religious freedom :\n`` Any reasonable observer who heard the President 's campaign promises , read his thinly justified orders banning overwhelmingly Muslim populations , and observed his Administration 's persistent statements linking the two , would view the order and each of its precursors as the fulfillment of the President 's promise to prohibit Muslim immigration to the United States . ''\nA number of civil rights , immigrant and Muslim advocates filed separate briefs opposing the government 's policies .
