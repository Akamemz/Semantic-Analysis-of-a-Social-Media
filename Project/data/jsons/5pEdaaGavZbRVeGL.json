    "content": "It \u2019 s not conservative , but rather a rejection of economic reality .\nOne particularly tough and indigestible nugget of talk-radio stupidity afflicting the guts of conservatism is the idea that there is some sort of fundamental difference between bribing a business with tax cuts and bribing it with a wheelbarrow full of cash . The Trump-Pence bailout of Carrier \u2019 s operations in Indiana provides an illustrative case .\nThis is an example of banality hardening into orthodoxy , the worst habit of the pop-con mind . It started with a good point . Once upon a time , U.S. personal-income tax rates were very high : 91 percent in the Eisenhower years , though hardly anybody paid that rate . Democrats such as John Kennedy and Republicans such as Ronald Reagan believed that these rates were far too high . Both Kennedy and Reagan made what we might broadly call \u201c Laffer curve \u201d arguments for tax cuts , though Reagan \u2019 s actual budget proposals were not quite as sunny as Arthur Laffer tends to be on the question of the real budgetary effects of tax-rate reductions . Milton Friedman took a more gimlet-eyed view with his advice that if tax cuts produce revenue growth , then you haven \u2019 t cut them enough .\nBut most Democrats , being reflexively big-government men , liked those 91 percent tax rates that nobody paid , because you could make people and businesses jump through all sorts of political hoops to keep from paying them . That still applies , which is why the United States has one of the highest notional corporate-tax rates in the developed world but a rather low effective corporate-tax rate : Businesses will do a lot to take that 40 percent bite down to 12 percent \u2014 or , if you \u2019 re a politically connected firm like General Electric , down to 0.00 percent in some years . Because Democrats liked those high rates , they complained , in their habitually dishonest way , that we couldn \u2019 t afford the cuts Republicans had proposed . This was pretty transparent stuff : For one thing , it allowed Democrats to partly neutralize Republican budget-hawkery , which was politically potent , while the subsequent demand for offsetting spending cuts made tax cuts a less attractive political proposition .\nPart of the Republican response to this was based on Lafferism , and generally on a very na\u00efve version of Lafferism : \u201c You can \u2019 t call that notional $ 1 billion tax cut a $ 1 billion expenditure , because the tax cut will produce growth effects that add to tax revenue. \u201d That is true as far as it goes \u2014 which is generally not as far as Republicans take it . There are commonly observed growth effects from cuts in tax rates , but they generally amount to something like 20 percent of the revenue \u201c lost \u201d under the static-projection model . Sometimes they have been more than that . But the pop-con belief that growth effects frequently amount to more than 100 percent of forgone revenue \u2014 that tax cuts \u201c pay for themselves \u201d or pay for themselves and then some \u2014 is not sustained by the evidence , and certainly not from the evidence of modern , advanced economies with tax rates that already are relatively low both by world standards and by historical standards .\nBut whatever the growth effects are , that \u2019 s a question of whether our model for estimating the budgetary costs of tax-rate reductions is any good ; it is not \u2013 as our talk-radio economists insist \u2014 a question of whether those costs actually are costs . If a $ 1 trillion tax cut turns out to lower revenue by only $ 800 billion instead of the full trillion , that is still , as a bottom-line matter , indistinguishable from spending $ 800 billion . This is of particular interest to a government that is carrying a very large debt load . The math doesn \u2019 t care whether your deficit comes from the revenue side of the ledger or the expenditure side . Debt is debt .\nRepublicans might have had a little bit of a point in the question of general tax cuts : A tax cut and spending are different things , even if the budgetary effects are exactly the same .\nBut in the matter of industry-specific or firm-specific tax benefits of the sort extended to Carrier in Indiana , they do not have a leg to stand on . These are straight-up corporate welfare , ethically and fiscally indistinguishable from shipping containers full of $ 100 bills .\nThose who take the opposite view work very hard to make a case that there is some kind of important ethical distinction between giving somebody something and declining to take something away from them . But relieving someone of an ordinary expense incurred in the normal course of affairs \u2014 as opposed to changing general tax law \u2014 is a gift . This is true both as a matter of law and of our ordinary experience . If I am , for example , a car dealer trying to win influence with a politician , and I sell him a new car at $ 50,000 under the price that I charge other customers , then I have paid him a $ 50,000 bribe . People go to jail for that . You \u2019 ll recall that part of the Barack Obama\u2013Tony Rezko scandal was the accusation that Rezko had arranged for the promising young politician to buy a house at $ 300,000 under its asking price . Rezko didn \u2019 t give Obama $ 300,000 in this scenario \u2014 he just saw to it that Obama didn \u2019 t have to spend that $ 300,000 . That is why bribery laws generally specify \u201c any pecuniary benefit \u201d rather than a duffel bag full of cash .\nFor Carrier \u2019 s accountant , any pecuniary benefit will do . So far as the bottom line is concerned , a $ 7 million tax credit is the same as a $ 7 million check or $ 7 million in Apple stock or $ 7 million in gold . It \u2019 s all + $ 7 million on the line where you want it .\nThe ethical question is more complicated than the pop-cons let on , too . Our government runs deficits , which means that a federal tax credit of $ 1 million given to Smith is $ 1 million in taxes that eventually will have to be paid \u2014 by Jones , and Wilson , and Humperdink \u2014 with interest . Carrier is a division of United Technologies ( the Otis elevator and Pratt & Whitney engines people ) , which is first and foremost a government contractor , a firm that derives at least a quarter of its revenue from government contracts , and 10 percent of it from Pentagon contracts alone . It is a company that has competitors \u2014 competitors who employ Americans and pay taxes , just as Carrier does . These firms and their employees are put at an economic disadvantage by the subsidies paid to Carrier thanks to Trump and Pence . That means that some of these companies probably will be less profitable , and that they will not hire people they otherwise would have hired . But you \u2019 ll see no Trump press conference celebrating that . This is a case of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat \u2019 s problem of the seen vs. the unseen . The benefits are easy to see , all those sympathetic workers in Indiana . The costs are born by sympathetic workers , too , around the country , and by their families and by their neighbors . But those are widely dispersed , so they are harder to see and do not hit with the same dramatic impact .\nThe math is the math . Trump and Pence are trying to sell you a free lunch .\nBut the math is the math is the math .
