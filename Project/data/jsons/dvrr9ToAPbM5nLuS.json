If that's the case, the question becomes why he doesn't go ahead and do that. Why put federal workers through the pain of forgoing pay and hamstring key government agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, if he could bypass Democratic objections with the snap of his presidential fingers?\n\nThe answer is because the solution isn't that simple. There are provisions of US law that allow the president to direct military construction projects during war or national emergency, but that money would have to come from Defence Department funds allocated by Congress for other purposes. Such a move may prompt Congress, including Republicans, to push back.\n\nThen there's the inevitable legal challenge from Democrats to such an exercise of presidential authority. Any presidential order to build a wall would be met by an equally imposing wall of court filings blocking its construction.\n\nThe president's latest suggestions are best viewed as simply another attempt to gain the upper hand in negotiations with Democrats.\n\nThis may not be a threat, more a bluff.\n\nWhat's the background?\n\nDemocrats, who now hold the majority in the House, passed spending bills on Thursday to reopen the government, including $1.3bn (\u00a31bn) of border security funds until 8 February.\n\nBut the legislation cannot take effect unless it passes the Republican-controlled Senate, where leader Mitch McConnell said his party would not back any measure without the president's support.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Five historic moments as new US Congress opens\n\nThe Kentucky senator called the Democratic budget \"a time-wasting act of political posturing\".\n\nIn Friday's news conference, Mr Trump also told reporters he might consider asking his cabinet to decline a $10,000 raise that is due to take effect because a pay freeze has expired as an inadvertent result of the shutdown.\n\nThe fiscal fiasco began when Congress and Mr Trump failed to reach an agreement over a budget bill in December.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The return of the woman Republicans love to hate\n\nThe Republicans had passed an initial funding bill including $5bn (\u00a34bn) for the wall, when they still had a majority in the House, but they could not get the necessary 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate.\n\nTwo vulnerable Republican senators up for re-election in 2020 - Cory Gardner of Colorado and Susan Collins of Maine - have broken ranks to back approving the budget and ending the shutdown.\n\nThe White House is again floating the idea of a deal for \"Dreamers\" - immigrants who illegally entered the US as children.\n\nDemocrats want to ensure that these individuals are shielded from deportation, but have insisted that they will not support a deal over wall funding.\n\nVice-President Mike Pence told Fox News the deal was being \"talked about\", but that Mr Trump said no deal was possible \"without a wall\".\n\nWhat does the partial shutdown mean?\n\nAbout 25% of the US federal government has no funding\n\nNine departments have been affected, including Homeland Security, Justice, Housing, Agriculture, Commerce, Interior, and the Treasury\n\nNative American tribes who receive substantial federal funding are struggling\n\nNational Parks have become hazardous without staff\n\n#ShutdownStories: The impact of the government shutdown\n\nMore on this story:\n\nMore women than ever before won seats in Congress in the 2018 mid-terms.\n\nWhat does it mean for Congress - and America?",
