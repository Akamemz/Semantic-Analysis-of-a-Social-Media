    "content": "The great culture wars on the campuses of the 1980s were largely lost by traditionalists . And the question then became not if but when the liberal arts would die off as a result . What is strange nearly 40 years later is that the apparent outrage over what was clearly foreordained is now becoming fact . What did academia expect , given its years of academic specialization and politicized indoctrination ?\nRecently the University of Wisconsin\u2013Stevens Point announced plans to drop liberal-arts majors in geography , geology , French , German , two- and three-dimensional art \u2014 and history . The Atlantic ran a well-meaning essay by Adam Harris on the controversial move , \u201c The Liberal Arts May Not Survive the 21st Century \u201d \u2014 again , a topic much in the news recently . The article \u2019 s chief thrust is that insidious efforts to promote STEM vocationalism \u2014 the need to prepare young people for careers requiring extensive math and science skill sets \u2014 has driven out the need for more in-depth focus on the liberal arts , in a climate in which crass Republican state legislators , in allegedly vindictive and short-sighted fashion , demanded catastrophic cuts in state public higher-education budgets .\nThe Stevens Point campus highlighted a popular perception that emphases in literature , history , or languages lead nowhere for cash-strapped graduates but to more debt and fewer jobs . Yet what the article on official university policy misses is why students do not concentrate in the liberal arts in the fashion of the past .\nAfter all , only that fact of declining enrollments allows the university to institutionalize the unspoken reality of eroding student interest . In other words , the university is simply burying liberal-arts majors that were already killed off not by bottom-line-minded state legislators but by the choices of either students or faculty or by university policies , or by combinations of all three .\nIf higher education \u2019 s increasing fixation on job training is the whirlpool that swallows history majors , the monster across the narrow straits of liberal-arts education is a many-headed politicized orthodoxy , a Scylla that consumes the flesh of the liberal arts and leave the bones as dreary reminders of boilerplate race , class , gender , and culture agendas . In the case of history , few increasingly wish to sit in a class where the past becomes tedious melodrama rather than complex tragedy , a sort of reeducation camp in which modern standards of suburban orthodoxy time-travel to the past in order to judge materially impoverished historical figures or pivotal events as either culpable or exonerated .\nThe tragedy , then , is not just that a campus of the University of Wisconsin would drop the history major but that the custodians of history in the 21st century lost the ability to teach and write about history in a way that sustains a hallowed 2,500-year tradition . In other words , what is being jettisoned is likely not just history as we once understood it but rather de facto poorly taught \u201c -studies \u201d courses \u2014 which sadly become snapshots of particular ( and often small ) eras of history \u2014 designed to offer enough historical proof of preconceived theories about contemporary modern society . The students then are assumed by the course \u2019 s end to be outraged , persuaded , galvanized , and shocked in politically acceptable ways . Usually they are just bored , as supposedly with-it professors endlessly regurgitate the esoterica picked up in graduate schools .\nOf course , not all historians see the past as an orthodox way of fixing the present , but enough do to discourage students , especially when younger faculty members draw on their rather specialized doctoral theses or narrow journal-article expertise to drive home an agenda that seems preachy or proselytizing to naturally resistant young spirits . To the Millennial mind , calcified Sixties-era radicalism is about as edgy as once was the Stalinist 1930s Old Left sermonizing to the Woodstock crowd . Trendiness that once pleased faculty committees and careerist deans did not always please students , and therefore the result is now not so pleasing to faculty committees and careerist deans .\nOnce a student has signed up for a class on the Renaissance or the Great Depression and quickly learns that it can become a periodic harangue on the oppression and victimization of particular marginalized groups , she will likely not wish to repeat the experience on money borrowed at between 5 and 7 percent interest , or to be convinced that her future employer wishes to be woke by a heady 21-year-old . The irony about the Atlantic article is that when it quotes liberal-arts and history professors to document their outrage at the Wisconsin cuts , their defense of their fields become perceptions of how history is necessary to advance particular contemporary agendas . So , for example , we are told that \u201c in mid-November , the university announced its plans to stop offering six liberal-arts majors , including geography , geology , French , German , two- and three-dimensional art , and history . The plan stunned observers , many of whom argued that at a time when Nazism is resurgent society needs for people to know history , even if the economy might not \u201d ( emphasis added ) .\nSo \u201c stunned observers \u201d offered a touch\u00e9 to both today \u2019 s Nazi apologists and right-wing money-grubbers !\nIn a utilitarian sense , students certainly can benefit from becoming aware of Nazi-like dangers by studying history . Unfortunately , few universities offer courses in World War II , which might most effectively offer a variety of explanations of why Nazi Germany was able to absorb most of Europe and trigger what would become a global conflict that cost 65 million lives .\nBut when one looks at the Wisconsin campus catalogue , one seems to find few if any classes in World War II . The closest might be \u201c Women , War and Peace , \u201d \u201c Dilemmas of War and Peace : An Introduction to Peace Studies , \u201d or \u201c War and Propaganda in the 20th Century. \u201d No doubt such offerings might be great courses , but I don \u2019 t think they would cover fully the Nazi aggrandizement of the late 1930s , particularly the role of Soviet collaboration , British and French appeasement , and American isolationism , or the tragic circumstance of the Munich Agreement \u2014 in other words , the likely best way for students \u201c to know history \u201d of any purported contemporary Nazi ascendance .\nNor I am sure that by agreement we live in a time \u201c when Nazism is resurgent. \u201d Certainly the world \u2019 s most frightening societies are North Korea and Venezuela , where wide-scale poverty and government oppression are normalized . Both are failed Communist states . The current likeliest threat to the global order for future generations of liberal societies will be statist and authoritarian China , whose government is still proudly Communist in a tradition that includes Mao Zedong \u2019 s 50 to 70 million dead . The point is that if students are interested in riveting history classes , they will probably not wish to be told that they should so enroll in one because \u201c Nazism is resurgent \u201d in today \u2019 s West .\nHarris in the Atlantic article also notes that \u201c the chairs of each department at the University of Wisconsin at Stevens Point were assessing their programs ahead of a biweekly meeting with the dean. \u201d The chair of the history department \u201c may not have been feeling great , but he was at least upbeat . \u2018 I felt like the department had really diversified its curriculum in a way to shore us up . \u2019 \u201d\nOne wonders what exactly \u201c diversified its curriculum \u201d means \u2014 the greater inclusion of now rare military , diplomatic , or political history , or more-diverse intellectual approaches or a greater variety of liberal and conservative historians ? Or does the reference to \u201c shoring up \u201d suggest ever narrower race , class , gender , and environmental courses , which deductively seek to use the past to lead students to preconceived contemporary agendas \u2014 and thereby so often erode students \u2019 natural interests in history ?\nYet if one walks through the local Barnes & Noble bookstore , reviews the non-fiction best-seller lists , scans Amazon \u2019 s most-read categories , or looks through book ads in popular magazines , one is struck how well biographies of Churchill and Grant sell , and how histories of war and peace , exploration , and political careers capture the public interest \u2014 reminding us that the fault of declining college interest in the liberal arts may be not in the stars of vocationalism or the wrong values of students but rather deep within the university faculty and administration themselves .\nTwenty years ago , John Heath and I co-authored Who Killed Homer ?
