    "content": "House Democrats have set up a packed schedule for their second full week of impeachment inquiry hearings , with nine witnesses set to testify between Tuesday and Thursday .\nThings kick off on Tuesday morning at 9 am Eastern , with testimony from Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman ( a National Security Council staffer ) and Jennifer Williams ( a State Department official detailed to the vice president \u2019 s office ) . We \u2019 ve embedded a live stream above , and you can also watch it on C-SPAN or on \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Facebook and Twitter .\nLater , on Tuesday afternoon at 2:30 pm Eastern , the committee will hear testimony from Kurt Volker ( the former US special representative for Ukraine ) and Tim Morrison ( a National Security Council staffer ) .\nThe hearing beginning Wednesday morning at 9 am Eastern will likely be especially explosive . It will be devoted entirely to Gordon Sondland , the US ambassador to the European Union . And Sondland is viewed by Democrats as the least credible witness so far \u2014 much of his testimony has conflicted with other aides \u2019 recollections and documents , and he \u2019 s already \u201c updated \u201d his testimony once . So expect him to face serious pressure over whether he \u2019 s telling the full story .\nThat afternoon , Wednesday at 2:30 pm Eastern , two lower-profile witnesses \u2014 Laura Cooper ( a Defense Department official ) and David Hale ( the under secretary of state for political affairs ) will appear .\nThe week \u2019 s testimony will close out on Thursday at 9 am Eastern , with testimony from Fiona Hill ( the former top NSC staffer handling Russia and Europe ) , as well as David Holmes ( a Kyiv-based State Department official who stepped forward only recently to report new information about the scandal . )\nAll of these witnesses have already given closed-door depositions in the impeachment inquiry , so most of what they have to say is already known . The hearings are primarily to have them repeat their accounts of what they saw transpire in public .\nAnd , for Ambassador Sondland in particular , they provide one more opportunity for him to try and remember some of the many things he failed to recall in his first go-round .\nThe impeachment inquiry has reached a point where relatively few of the underlying facts are disputed . Extensive witness testimony and documents have clarified the following :\nVery soon after Ukraine elected a new president , Volodymyr Zelensky , in April 2019 , Trump \u2019 s lawyer Rudy Giuliani began urging Zelensky \u2019 s team to launch certain investigations Trump wanted .\nSome Trump administration officials became involved in this effort , too . Specifically , they demanded investigations into Burisma ( a Ukrainian gas company that Joe Biden \u2019 s son Hunter sat on the board of ) and into purported Ukrainian interference with the 2016 US election .\nWhen Trump talked to Zelensky on the phone on July 25 , he brought up both investigations specifically and urged Zelensky to talk to Giuliani and Attorney General Bill Barr about them .\nThe Ukrainians were seeking a White House meeting between Trump and Zelensky . Trump officials told them that they wouldn \u2019 t get it unless they committed to those investigations : a quid pro quo .\nAround the same time , Trump was holding up nearly $ 400 million in military assistance Congress had approved for Ukraine \u2019 s government . Ambassador Sondland has admitted telling the Ukrainians that they likely wouldn \u2019 t get the aid unless they placated Trump by publicly committing to the investigations . The aid , however , was let through just before this scandal broke into public view .\nWe \u2019 re still lacking some facts about the military aid holdup and release ( because the key officials involved , like acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and former National Security Adviser John Bolton have refused to testify ) . Still , the question of whether a quid pro quo was presented to the Ukrainians is no longer in doubt . In fact , two were \u2014 first , a White House meeting in exchange for investigations , and then , releasing military aid in exchange for investigations .\nMeanwhile , Trump \u2019 s team is still trying to downplay the extent of the president \u2019 s involvement in all this \u2014 arguing that it was limited to what he said on just one phone call . But more information keeps coming out suggesting he was personally involved in what his aides and allies were doing all along .\nNine separate witnesses are expected to testify this week . Some were more involved in the scandal than others \u2014 and some may be more eager to defend Trump politically than others .\nFor instance , three of the approved witnesses \u2014 Kurt Volker , Tim Morrison , and David Hale \u2014 were actually requested by Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee . ( The GOP requested a longer list , but Democrats only approved those they deemed most relevant to the inquiry ) .\nNone of these witnesses will get Trump off the hook , exactly \u2014 in fact , Morrison \u2019 s testimony can be read as quite damning for Trump , and Volker turned over a plethora of text messages that have been crucial evidence for Democrats . But Republicans who heard their closed-door testimony evidently concluded they \u2019 d each by politically helpful in some way .\nAnother witness \u2014 Gordon Sondland \u2014 has also seemed to be trying gamely to protect Trump in his testimony so far , often in ways that strain credulity . For instance , he has argued that the quid pro quo push came relatively late and that he didn \u2019 t even realize it was about the Bidens , he has tried to put the blame for it on Giuliani , and he has repeatedly failed to \u201c recall \u201d any personal involvement from Trump in it .\nBut after Sondland went in to give his initial deposition , other witnesses told the impeachment investigators a very different story .
