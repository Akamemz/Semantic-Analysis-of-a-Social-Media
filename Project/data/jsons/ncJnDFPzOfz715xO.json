A decision likely will not be announced by the Supreme Court until May or June .\nAll eyes were on Chief Justice John Roberts -- who surprised many in 2012 when he voted to uphold the law -- he said next to nothing , in a clear strategy not to tip his hand either way .\n`` Roberts , who 's usually a very active participant in oral arguments , said almost nothing for an hour and a half , '' said CNN 's Supreme Court analyst Jeffrey Toobin , who attended the arguments . `` ( Roberts ) was so much a focus of attention because of his vote in the first Obamacare case in 2012 that he somehow did n't want to give people a preview of how he was thinking in this case . ... He said barely a word .

'' Just 16 states have established their own exchanges , but millions of Americans living in the 34 states are receiving subsidies through federally facilitated exchanges .\nBut Justice Elena Kagan , suggested the law should be interpreted in its `` whole context '' and not in the one snippet of the law that is the focus of the challengers .\n`` We look at the whole text .

''\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor was concerned that in the states where the individuals may not be able to receive subsidies , `` We 're going to have the death spiral that this system was created to avoid . ''\nAnd Sotomayor wondered why the four words that so bother the challengers did not appear more prominently in the law . She said it was like hiding `` a huge thing in a mousetrap . ''\n`` Do you really believe that states fully understood ? '' she asked , Carvin , that those with federally run exchanges `` were not going to get subsidies ? ''\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg suggested the four words at issue were buried and `` not in the body of the legislation where you would expect to find '' them .\nJustice Anthony Kennedy asked questions that could be interpreted for both sides , but he was clearly concerned with the federalism aspects of the case .\n`` Let me say that from the standpoint of the dynamics of Federalism , '' he said to Carvin . `` It does seem to me that there is something very powerful to the point that if your argument is accepted , the states are being told either create your own exchange , or we 'll send your insurance market into a death spiral . ''\nHe grilled Carvin on the `` serious '' consequences for those states that had set up federally-facilitated exchanges .\n`` It seems to me that under your argument , perhaps you will prevail in the plain words of the statute , there 's a serious constitutional problem if we adopt your argument , '' Kennedy said .\nThe IRS -- which is charged with implementing the law -- interprets the subsidies as being available for all eligible individuals in the health exchanges nationwide , in both exchanges set up by the states and the federal government .
