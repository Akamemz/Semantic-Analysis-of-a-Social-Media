    "content": "China \u2019 s president , Xi Jinping , has told Donald Trump in a phone call that all sides should avoid rhetoric or action that would worsen tensions on the Korean peninsula , according to Chinese state media .\nReports quoted Xi as saying : \u201c At present , the relevant parties must maintain restraint and avoid words and deeds that would exacerbate the tension on the Korean peninsula . \u201d\nTrump has pushed China to pressure North Korea to halt a nuclear weapons programme that is nearing the capability of targeting the United States . China is the North \u2019 s biggest economic partner and source of aid .\nTrump on Friday went further to turn the crisis into a personal battle of wills between him and Kim Jong-un , warning the North Korean leader he would \u201c truly regret \u201d hostile acts against US territory or US allies .\nDonald Trump loyalists eager to back up his rhetoric on North Korea Read more\nThe warning came a few hours after an early morning tweet from the president that claimed US military options were \u201c locked and loaded \u201d for use if Pyongyang \u201c acted unwisely \u201d .\nThe tweet triggered worldwide alarm and a rebuke from the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , who said : \u201c I consider an escalation of rhetoric the wrong answer . \u201d\nBut Trump stood by his words when asked about them at his golf resort in New Jersey . \u201c I hope they are going to fully understand the gravity of what I said , and what I said is what I mean , \u201d he said . \u201c Those words are very , very easy to understand . \u201d\nTrump then issued an ultimatum to Kim Jong-un himself . \u201c This man will not get away with what he \u2019 s doing , \u201d he said . \u201c If he utters one threat in the form of an overt threat \u2026 or if he does anything in respect to Guam or anyplace else that \u2019 s an American territory or an American ally , he will truly regret it and he will regret it fast . \u201d\nBoris Johnson , the UK foreign secretary , said on Twitter that Britain was working with the US and other countries in the region to end the diplomatic crisis .\nHe said the international community stood \u201c shoulder to shoulder in ensuring North Korea stops its aggressive acts \u201d , adding :\nBoris Johnson ( @ BorisJohnson ) The North Korean regime is the cause of this problem and they must fix it\nThe North Korean leadership has warned it will launch four missiles at the waters around US Pacific territory of Guam as a warning to the US if it persists with its practice sorties by long-range bombers based on the island .\nDespite gung-ho language from the US president , there was no change in US deployments in the region or a change in the alert status of US forces . And it was reported on Friday that the Trump administration had reopened a channel of communication between US and North Korean diplomats at the UN .\nAccording to the Associated Press , the \u201c New York channel \u201d had been broken off by North Korea in protest against sanctions in 2016 , but it was revived this year between Joseph Yun , the US envoy for North Korea policy , and Pak Song-il , a senior North Korean diplomat at the country \u2019 s UN mission .\nThe US state department said it had no comment on the report . It had previously been reported that there had been diplomatic contacts about US detainees in North Korea , but the new AP account said the talks addressed wider issues , although such contacts had so far failed to moderate the exchange of threats between the leaders of the two countries .\nAsked about the report on Friday , Trump said : \u201c Well , we don \u2019 t want to talk about progress , we don \u2019 t want to talk about back channels .\n\u201c We want to talk about a country that has misbehaved for many many years \u2013 decades , actually \u2013 through numerous administrations , and they didn \u2019 t want to take on the issue and I had no choice but to take it on , and I \u2019 m taking it on . And we \u2019 ll either be very , very successful quickly or we \u2019 re going to be very , very successful in a different way , quickly . \u201d\nAs for Merkel \u2019 s criticism earlier in the day , Trump said : \u201c Maybe she \u2019 s speaking for Germany ; let her speak for Germany . She \u2019 s a friend of mine , she \u2019 s a very good person , a very good woman , she \u2019 s a friend of Ivanka . Perhaps she is referring to Germany . She \u2019 s certainly not referring to the United States , that I can tell you . \u201d\nIn his comments , Trump made it clear that domestic political considerations played a role in shaping his rhetoric .\n\u201c If somebody else uttered the exact same words that I uttered , they \u2019 d say : \u2018 What a great statement , what a wonderful statement , \u2019 \u201d Trump said . \u201c But I will tell you , we have tens of millions of people in this country that are so happy with what I am saying , because they say , \u2018 Finally , we have a president that \u2019 s sticking up for our nation and frankly , sticking up for our friends and our allies . \u2019 \u201d\nSpeaking to reporters in California , the US defence secretary , James Mattis , said a conflict on the Korean peninsula would be \u201c catastrophic \u201d and stressed that US diplomats should take the lead in resolving the crisis .\nMattis pointed to a UN security council vote at the weekend for more sanctions against North Korea as a sign that diplomacy was making progress .\nQuick guide Are US defences strong enough to ward off North Korean missiles ? Show Hide What kind of anti-missile defences does the US possess ? The US has various anti-missile options , some designed to take down missiles at short-range and others for medium-to-long-range . The US relies heavily on the US Patriot missile and the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defence ( THAAD ) . The US deployed THAAD to South Korea this year to defend against medium-range missiles . There is a three-phased defence system : ground-based missiles on the Korean peninsula ; US naval ships stationed in the Pacific ; and two bases in Alaska and California that can launch an estimated 36 interceptors .\nIs the US system robust enough to stop a North Korean missile attack ? No air defence system offers anything like a complete guarantee of success . The Pentagon offer repeated assurances that air defence systems would be more than a match for any North Korean attack . But when missile defence systems have been put to the test over the last few decades , the performance has been far from reassuring .\nThe US provided anti-missile defence systems to Israel and Saudi Arabia during the First Gulf War as protection against Iraq 's Scud missiles . It was initially claimed that they had shot down 41 of 42 missiles fired by Iraq . But eventually it was acknowledged that only a few missiles had been hit .\nRecent tests of interceptors have provided little comfort \u2013 with success rates of around 50 % on average . The Pentagon celebrated in May when it destroyed a mock warhead over the Pacific but overall the performance has been spotty . Since the newest intercept system was introduced in 2004 only four of nine intercept attempts have been successful . Of the five tests since 2010 , only two have been successful .\nHowever , Friday \u2019 s tweet , sent out by Trump at about 7.30am from his golf resort in Bedminster , New Jersey , put the emphasis back on the use of force :\nDonald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) Military solutions are now fully in place , locked and loaded , should North Korea act unwisely . Hopefully Kim Jong Un will find another path !\nA White House official later played down the significance of the tweet , saying there were continuously updated military contingency plans for any global crisis . \u201c This isn \u2019 t anything new , \u201d the official said , according to CNN .\nThe contingency plan for war on the Korean peninsula , Oplan 5027 , envisages a build-up of the US military , including half the US navy and more than 1,000 aircraft in the region , over 90 days . More than 200,000 US civilians would also have to be evacuated .\nLater on Friday morning , the president retweeted US Pacific command , which had posted pictures of B-1B Lancer heavy bombers on exercises over the Pacific with the Japanese and South Korean air forces on 7 August , accompanied by text saying the planes were ready to fulfil the \u201c ready to fight tonight \u201d mission of US forces in South Korea , \u201c if called upon to do so \u201d .\nTrump \u2019 s messages continued a war of words between the president and North Korea that ignited on Tuesday when Trump , following reports of a breakthrough in Pyongyang \u2019 s weapons programme , threatened to unleash \u201c fire and fury like the world has never seen \u201d on North Korea if the regime continued to threaten the US .\nKim Jong-un \u2019 s government responded the next day by deriding Trump \u2019 s remarks as a \u201c lot of nonsense \u201d and publishing detailed plans to launch missiles to land in the waters around the US Pacific territory of Guam .\nPyongyang has warned that continued practice sorties by B-1B bombers over South Korea would trigger the launch of the four Hwasong-12 intermediate-range missiles that would be aimed at the waters around their base on Guam .\n\u201c This grave situation requires the KPA [ Korean People \u2019 s Army ] to closely watch Guam , the outpost and beachhead for invading the DPRK , and necessarily take practical actions of significance to neutralise it , \u201d a KPA spokesman said on the state news service .\nIt added that the missile launch , if ordered , would aim \u201c to contain the US major military bases on Guam , including the Andersen air force base , in which the US strategic bombers , which get on the nerves of the DPRK and threaten and blackmail it through their frequent visits to the sky above South Korea , are stationed , and to send a serious warning signal to the US \u201d .\nThe B-1 bombers have been modified so as to be non-nuclear capable , but the North Korean statement identifies them as \u201c nuclear strategic bombers \u201d , one of many examples of misperceptions and overheated rhetoric that fog the Korean standoff .\n\u201c The United States should think carefully about authorizing further B-1 flights . Leadership may decide to defy the North Korean threat , but should make that decision consciously and take measures to limit the risk of that action , \u201d said Adam Mount , an expert on North Korea at the Center for American Progress .\nThe Guam authorities issued new emergency guidelines on Friday that included advice of what to do in the event of a nuclear attack .\n\u201c Do not look at the flash or fireball \u2013 it can blind you , \u201d the fact sheet said . \u201c Take cover behind anything that might offer protection . \u201d\nAsked about the potential for military confrontation , Mattis told reporters it was his responsibility to prepare \u201c military options should they be needed \u201d .\nBut he warned : \u201c The tragedy of war is well enough known ; it doesn \u2019 t need another characterisation , beyond the fact that it would be catastrophic . \u201d\nAlongside its missiles and nuclear warheads , North Korea has thousands of pieces of heavy artillery , capable of inflicting devastating damage on Seoul .\nThe US has about 35,000 troops stationed in South Korea and 40,000 in Japan . They have not been put on a higher alert or redeployed in recent days despite the heated rhetoric .\nMalcolm Nance , a former naval intelligence officer , said that there had been none of the normal indicators of heightened alert at US bases in the region .\n\u201c We are not ready for even a small action size of Libya much less Korean War 2.0 , \u201d Nance said in a tweet . \u201c This talk of Locked & Loaded is irresponsible madness . \u201d\nDonald Trump loyalists eager to back up his rhetoric on North Korea Read more\nHowever , large-scale air , sea and land exercises are planned for later this month , which could ratchet tensions up further .\nTrump was due to interrupt his working holiday for a lightning visit to Washington on Monday , according to one report . But it was not clear whether the trip was connected to the North Korean stand-off , and there are secure facilities at his Bedminster golf club where he can discuss national security matters .\nThe North Korean military has said its planned missile test aimed at the sea around Guam will be ready for launch on orders of the country \u2019 s leader from mid-August .\nIn his remarks , however , Mattis repeatedly underlined the role of diplomacy and non-military pressure on Pyongyang , and the key roles played by the secretary of state , Rex Tillerson , and the US envoy to the United Nations , Nikki Haley .\n\u201c You can see the American effort is diplomatically led , \u201d Mattis said . He added : \u201c It has diplomatic traction . It is gaining diplomatic results . And I want to stay right there right now . \u201d",
