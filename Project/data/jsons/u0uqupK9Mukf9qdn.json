He purchased the seven-day Mongolian hunting trip at a National Rifle Association charity auction before his father announced his candidacy for president in 2015 , the spokesman said , and flew commercial in and out of the country . It \u2019 s unclear if the auction item listed an argali or mentioned meetings with Mongolian government officials .\nMongolia is a resource-rich , young democracy that considers the U.S. an important ally as it faces pressure from its powerful neighbors , particularly the Chinese . Legislation introduced this year in Congress would give duty-free treatment to Mongolian cashmere and other products in an effort to increase trade between the two countries \u2014 and lessen its reliance on China .\nThe hunt came just weeks after high-level government discussions \u2014 including a White House meeting \u2014 between officials from the U.S. and Mongolia , a landlocked country sandwiched between Russia and China . Mongolia refers to the U.S. as its \u201c third neighbor , \u201d relying on America for economic and security support .

His company , Marmara International LLC , is on the board of the Mongolian hunting and wildlife association and has been recognized for its work on argali wildlife preservation by the Mongolian Environmental Ministry .\nIn an interview , Ahat called the trophy hunting permitting system in Mongolia \u201c very political. \u201d He wouldn \u2019 t say how he arranged for Trump Jr. \u2019 s permit , or acknowledge that the hunt took place , but he praised Trump Jr. \u201c Don Jr. was an upstanding person , he never did anything that was unpleasant , \u201d Ahat said . \u201c He treated people with respect . \u201d\nAhat said the embassy \u2019 s defense attache accompanied the hunting party on the trip .

Four members of the Kardebai family , local herders who served as scouts on Trump Jr. \u2019 s hunt , confirmed to \u2588\u2588\u2588 that they were paid for their services but wouldn \u2019 t disclose how much or by whom .\nTrump Jr. posted this photo on his Instagram of himself with his son , Donnie , outside a Mongolian yurt .

The animals are listed as threatened under the U.S . Endangered Species Act .\nAdvocates say trophy hunting can help conserve threatened species by managing the population \u2019 s size . They say permit fees go toward supporting local communities , who are paid for their services and keep the meat harvested from the kills . But some conservation biologists and animal rights groups contend the hunting programs are ineffective and can lead to disruption of local ecosystems .\nIn Mongolia , the permit process has been rife with favoritism , experts say .

There are sometimes discrepancies between the number of permits issued and the official quota figures for argali , he said . The government has allotted 86 such permits to be issued this year , with specific numbers assigned to each hunting region across the country , for a season that lasts from July 1 to Sept. 30 .
