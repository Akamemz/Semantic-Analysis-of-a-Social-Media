During the April 13 coronavirus task force press briefing , Trump was asked if he and Fauci were \u201c on the same page. \u201d He responded : \u201c Yeah , we have been from the beginning. \u201d At the same press briefing , Fauci discussed how responsive Trump was to the recommendations made by the task force . After discussing the recommendations they made regarding mitigation , Fauci mentioned : \u201c The travel [ restriction ] was another recommendation , when we went in and said , \u2018 We probably should be doing that. \u2019 And the answer was \u2018 yes. \u2019 And then another time was , \u2018 We should do it with Europe , \u2019 and the answer was \u2018 yes. \u2019 And the next time , \u2018 We should do it with the U.K. , \u2019 and the answer was \u2018 yes . \u2019 \u201d\nWhile Fauci said in the earlier stages of the pandemic that a China travel ban was \u201c not something that I think we 're even considering , \u201d according to New York Times interviews with White House aides and Fauci himself , by January 30 the leading public health officials in the federal government were recommending travel restrictions with China to President Trump . Aides also told the Wall Street Journal that it was Fauci , CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield , and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar that convinced the initially- skeptical Trump to make the decision . Azar \u2019 s explanation of the decision echoes this reporting , as he said the travel restrictions were implemented based on \u201c the uniform recommendations of the career public health officials here at HHS . \u201d\nFauci supported the travel restrictions with China publicly as well . At the task force press briefing on the day the restrictions were announced , Fauci said that \u201c because there are so many unknowns here , we \u2019 re going to take the action that the secretary will describe [ restricting travel from China ] , in a temporary way , to make sure we mitigate , as best as we possibly can , this risk . \u201d\nOn February 3 , the day after the restrictions took effect , Fauci appeared on CNBC and stated : \u201c As the entry into the United States of potentially infected people is diminished because of the travel restrictions on both sides , of getting out of China and getting into the United States , I think you are going to see a dampening down of [ coronavirus cases in the United States ] . And that \u2019 s the reason why this was done : to protect Americans from travel-related cases . \u201d\nOn February 7 , Fauci told reporters that the positives of travel restrictions with China outweigh the negatives and that \u201c this decision was not made lightly . \u201d\nDuring the February 29 coronavirus task force press briefing , Fauci repeated how valuable he saw the travel restrictions : \u201c We prevented travel from China to the United States . If we had not done that , we would have had many , many more cases right here that we would have to be dealing with. \u201d ( The restrictions didn \u2019 t actually prevent all travel from China ; they merely restricted it . )\nOn March 15 , Fauci said , \u201c The president 's decision to essentially have a major blocking of travel from China , that already had an effect of not seeding the way , in Europe\u2014Italy did n't do that. \u201d The next week , on March 22 , Fauci said the United States was \u201c not necessarily at all \u201d on the same trajectory for coronavirus cases as Italy , citing Italy \u2019 s decision not to \u201c shut out as well the input of infections that originated in China \u201d early on as a possible reason the country was hit particularly hard .\nFauci has consistently agreed with the travel decision .
