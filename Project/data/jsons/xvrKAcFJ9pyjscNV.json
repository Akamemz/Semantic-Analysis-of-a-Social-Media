The Department of Justice is also investigating the IRS . So at the same time it \u2019 s supposed to conduct a fair and impartial investigation on the one hand , and it is saying that it can , it is defending the IRS in court on the other hand on the missing document cases . I think there is a potential appearance of a conflict of interest there .\nDOBBS : And you point out in a recent , one of your op-eds that Andrew Strelka - speaking of conflict of interests - who used to work with Lois Lerner is now part of the Justice Department \u2019 s tax division , a key member of the Justice Department \u2019 s investigation . That has a certain appearance too ? Doesn \u2019 t it ?\nATTKISSON : Yes , there are several players at the Justice Department who have alleged potential conflicts of interest in this investigation . In particular he , the man you mentioned , Strelka worked under Lois Lerner , maintained a relationship with her . There are e-mails produced by the House Oversight committee that show he thanked her for the help that he had given her in the time that he worked in her division and held her partly responsible for some of the success that he \u2019 s , he \u2019 d held . He also , according to documents , was part of a discussion about focusing on Tea Party cases . So there , there are some e-mail documents that lend to the idea that he could have been part of that scandal all together rather than somebody who should be part of the department investigating it . That \u2019 s the allegation from Republicans on House Oversight . They \u2019 ve once again asked Eric Holder of the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel to get at this investigation rather than doing it himself to avoid this appearance of a conflict .\nDOBBS : Sharyl let \u2019 s go to that issue of a special counselor investigator . I don \u2019 t know that anyone would have much confidence in anyone appointed by this attorney general in the Obama Justice Department . I mean everywhere we turn there seems to be an Obama appointee who is effectively blocking the progress for the search for truth . Without Judicial Watch , without the Oversight committee in particular we wouldn \u2019 t know what the hell is going on in this government at all , would we ?\nATTKISSON : Perhaps not . It \u2019 s hard to say how a special counsel would turn out . But to your point when the IRS commissioner [ John ] Koskinen was brought in to basically , we were told , to get at the bottom of things and get at the truth . Based on his actions in his testimony to Congress it seems as though his edict , at least in the actions that he \u2019 s given , was more about protecting the IRS , not necessarily getting to the truth . He \u2019 s given testimony before Congress that has proven to be inaccurate on more than one occasion , including about these back-up tapes . It \u2019 s hard to know whether he simply doesn \u2019 t know the truth or hasn \u2019 t been fully briefed or something else . But I think that speaks to what you were saying .\nDOBBS : Sharyl Attkisson we appreciate you being with us . Thanks so much .",
