Martin Luther King Jr. 's `` I Have a Dream '' speech Wednesday on the same steps the civil rights leader spoke from half a century ago .\n`` His words belong to the ages , possessing a power and prophecy unmatched in our time , '' Obama told a diverse crowd that gathered under gray skies and intermittent drizzle to attend the hours-long ceremony .\nKing , Obama said , `` gave mighty voice to the quiet hopes of millions , '' hailing leaders who braved intimidation and violence in their fight for equal rights .\nOn that August day in 1963 , when King and his fellow marchers attended what he labeled `` the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation , '' few in that crowd could have imagined that half a century later , an African-American president of the United States would mark the occasion with a speech in the same location .\nAnd during his remarks from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial , Obama cast his own election to the Oval Office as a consequence of persistence and courage from leaders such as King .\n`` Because they kept marching , America changed , '' Obama said . `` Because they marched , city councils changed and state legislatures changed and Congress changed and , yes , eventually , the White House changed . ''\nWhile other , negative changes have forestalled the push toward racial harmony , Obama stressed Wednesday that the work of civil rights leaders had permanently changed the discourse between races in America .\n`` To dismiss the magnitude of this process , to suggest , as some sometimes do , that little has changed , that dishonors the courage and the sacrifice of those who paid the price to march in those years , '' Obama said .\nAdopting words from another of King 's speeches , Obama declared that `` the arc of the moral universe may bend toward justice , but it does n't bend on its own . ''\nLeaders speaking at Wednesday 's anniversary event , including Obama , stressed that income disparity , high unemployment and a shrinking middle class have slashed hopes for attaining equality for millions of Americans , though the president said those facts could n't erase the forward march of the civil rights movement .\n`` To secure the gains this country has made requires constant vigilance , not complacency , '' he said , adding , `` We will suffer the occasional setback , but we will win these fights . This country has changed too much . ''\nIn an interview after the speech , he said he wished his policies had done more to improve the gap between those who have wealth and those who do not .\n`` It certainly weighs on me , '' he told PBS . `` In my first term , essentially , my job was to make sure , as you said , that the economy did n't just completely collapse . ''\nOther speakers Wednesday marked the great progress toward King 's goal of racial accord , though many suggested that the dream was far from realized , specifically citing voter identification laws that critics say prevent African-Americans from casting ballots , and the verdict in the closely watched Trayvon Martin murder trial .\n`` We have come a great distance in this country in the 50 years . But we still have a great distance to go before we fulfill the dream of Martin Luther King Jr. , '' said U.S. Rep. John Lewis , D-Georgia , adding that progress toward King 's goal could be marked by his own election to Congress .\n`` But there are still invisible signs , barriers in the hearts of humankind that form a gulf between us , '' said Lewis , the only speaker from the 1963 march who also spoke Wednesday .\nAnother leader from King 's era of the civil rights movement , Myrlie Evers-Williams , said the United States had `` certainly taken a turn backwards '' in the quest for civil rights .\nTwo former presidents also delivered remarks Wednesday , each representing a distinct era in the movement for equal rights in America . President Jimmy Carter , speaking ahead of Obama , asserted that recent developments in American policy would have disappointed King .\n`` I believe we all know how Dr. King would have reacted to the new ID requirements to exclude certain voters , especially African-Americans , '' said Carter , a Democrat . `` I think we all know how Dr. King would have reacted to the Supreme Court striking down a crucial part of the Voting Rights Act just recently passed overwhelmingly by Congress . ''\nAnd another Democratic president , Bill Clinton , argued during his speech for working together against stalemates and inaction , saying King `` did not live and die to hear his heirs whine about political gridlock . ''\n`` It is time to stop complaining and put our shoulders against the stubborn gates holding the American people back , '' Clinton said .\nNeither of the living former Republican presidents attended Wednesday 's event .
