    "content": "LITTLE ROCK , Arkansas\u2014Mike Huckabee was not a millionaire when he ran for president in 2008 , and liked to let people know it during his underdog campaign against wealthy rivals like John McCain and Mitt Romney .\n\u201c I may not be the expert that some people are on foreign policy , but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night , \u201d he quipped .\nNow , after hosting his own Fox News show and a syndicated radio program , while authoring several books , the former governor is solidly \u2013 and , some would say , ostentatiously \u2014 a part of the one percent .\nThere \u2019 s the 10,900-square-foot beachfront mansion he built on Florida \u2019 s Panhandle , worth more than $ 3 million . There are regular trips on private jets , often to elite events at which he has given countless paid speeches .\nOn Tuesday , as he formally kicked off his second campaign for the presidency , Huckabee knows he must reassure his former supporters that he has not changed even as his pockets grew much , much deeper . His announcement , in the small town of Hope where he grew up poor , reflects a broader effort by his campaign to show that he \u2019 s still folksy and down-to-earth .\n\u201c I think I \u2019 m the same person that I was , \u201d the 59-year-old told \u2588\u2588\u2588 during an interview ahead of his announcement . \u201c I haven \u2019 t , to my knowledge , changed a single belief or conviction . I believe everything I believed in 2008 . \u201d\nLast time , he won the Iowa caucuses and carried seven other states with a populist message that the little guy was getting trampled by the special interests .\n\u201c Where my strength really came from was blue-collar working class people , \u201d Huckabee recalled . \u201c They didn \u2019 t have money but they had energy . They felt like no one else was there to speak for them or even knew who they were . I think they believed , and I think they still believe , that not only have I come from them \u2013 that \u2019 s who I am \u2013 but that I \u2019 ve never lost touch with what it \u2019 s like to be out there working harder and getting nowhere . \u201d\nMore than anyone else in the 2016 field , including Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul , the former Southern Baptist minister decries the influence of \u201c corporatists \u201d and \u201c globalists \u201d over the GOP . Still , hints of his fabulous new life bleed into his rhetoric . He raised eyebrows during a speech in New Hampshire two weeks ago , for instance , when he recalled a recent conversation with a Russian limo driver .\n\u201c A couple of weeks ago I was in Los Angeles , and I was going to be on The Bill Maher Show , \u201d he told hundreds of activists at the climax of a half-hour speech . \u201c The driver comes and picks me up at the hotel and is taking me to the studio . \u201d\nIn short , the driver fled the Soviet Union in 1988 with his infant daughter and they \u2019 re now living the American Dream : the dad owns the car service company , and his daughter became a nurse . \u201c I said , \u2018 Dmitri , you make more sense and talk better than 90 percent of the people we \u2019 ve elected to Congress , \u2019 \u201d Huckabee told the crowd . \u201c He said , \u2018 Well I don \u2019 t think I \u2019 ll ever have that platform. \u2019 I told him , \u2018 Dmitri , you may not . Maybe you don \u2019 t want it . But I hope I can tell your story ! \u2019 \u201d\nHuckabee still tells his own up-from-the-bootstraps story , but it \u2019 s not quite the same as in 2008 \u2013 when he \u2019 d only been out of the governorship for a year and had a small bank account .\nDuring that campaign , in the days before the crucial Wisconsin primary , Huckabee was so strapped for cash that he went off the trail to deliver a paid speech in the Cayman Islands . \u201c You \u2019 ve got to work for a living and pay your bills , \u201d he said at the time . He attacked Romney that year for looking like \u201c the guy who laid you off. \u201d He held events at Pizza Ranches because it was free to rent space at the chain restaurant .\nIn the years since , Huckabee has aggressively filled his coffers .\nA \u2588\u2588\u2588 report last July highlighted his penchant for using private jets . He \u2019 s racked up more than a quarter-million dollars in private air travel bills over the past few years and has routinely insisted that candidates or local parties that he \u2019 s coming to support pay the expense .\nThe New York Times recently spotlighted dubious groups Huckabee has rented his campaign email list out to \u2013 from survivalists warning of coming food shortages to a group that says there \u2019 s a miracle cure for cancer hidden in the Bible ( which people can find out about with a $ 72 subscription to their product ) . Huckabee recorded an infomercial for a sketchy diabetes treatment that scientists say is bunk .\nHe enters the 2016 race with high expectations . Because he won Iowa last time , many pundits say the caucuses will be do-or-die for him this time . Not surprisingly , his first appearances after the Arkansas announcement are there .\n\u201c A second or third place finish does not move him forward , \u201d said Ed Rollins , the national chairman of Huckabee \u2019 s 2008 campaign , who has not endorsed him for 2016 .\nA broader \u2014 and probably more important \u2014 question is whether a retread can stand out in a crowded field with fresher faces . Even his rollout has been partly overshadowed by dark horse upstarts like former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson , both of whom announced on Monday .\nLeading social conservatives in Iowa say that Huckabee retains a big reservoir of goodwill , but that he can not count on retaining his supporters from 2008 . Many broke for Rick Santorum in 2012 , who will run again . And this time , candidates like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker have already been making an aggressive play for his base of support . Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is traveling the early states making the case that the party needs to nominate a young , fresh face to contrast with Hillary Clinton . Huckabee notes that he was battling the Clintons for decades in Arkansas before anyone else even heard of them .\nHuckabee has acknowledged he probably needs to win Iowa again and should perform stronger in New Hampshire than last time . South Carolina , the first state in the South with a primary , could give him a boost if he gets momentum and enough money from the first contests .\nThat makes March 1 central to his strategy . A handful of Southern states Huckabee won in 2008 , including Arkansas , have coordinated to schedule an \u201c SEC primary \u201d that day .\nIronically , though he \u2019 s now rich himself , it \u2019 s an open question whether Huckabee will be able to raise enough money to stay in the race through the SEC primary and beyond . He \u2019 ll get a lot of small-dollar gifts , but he has yet to demonstrate the ability to put together a high-dollar finance operation . \u201c That \u2019 s not been solved , to the best of my knowledge , \u201d said Rollins .\nIowa GOP operative Nick Ryan , who ran the pro-Rick Santorum super PAC in 2012 , will run the pro-Huckabee super PAC this time . A handful of big donors from the evangelical community could sustain the governor if they chose to do so in this post-Citizens United world , another change since he ran last time .\nOne thing money can not easily buy is the name recognition that Huckabee already has from his first run . He undeniably enters the race as a well-defined figure , and especially in the case of Iowa Republicans , remains well-liked , according to polls .\nHuckabee says he has not changed , but he knows campaigns have . He recognizes that he \u2019 s likely to be outspent but seems to have satisfied himself that he can raise enough money to be viable . He made clear that his campaign will more aggressively push back on attacks using social media and other platforms .\n\u201c People asked me how to spell my name eight years ago , \u201d Huckabee said . \u201c They didn \u2019 t know what state I had been governor of or for how long . I \u2019 ve had a rather significant national platform \u2026 It \u2019 s not like I \u2019 ve been in hibernation for eight years . I \u2019 ve been more visible than when I was a candidate or an office holder . \u201d\nHuckabee has mellowed a bit . His fifth grandchild is on the way . He says he learned a lot of lessons from the last campaign about \u201c pace and rhythm \u201d to inform how he \u2019 d approach another one .\n\u201c You learn not to be overly alarmed at a single poll at any particular point , particularly early , \u201d he said . \u201c You learn not to be overly excitable about the flow of things because it changes so often and rapidly . \u201d\nHuckabee \u2019 s inner circle is packed with loyalists from his 2008 campaign . His daughter , GOP operative Sarah Huckabee Sanders , will manage the 2016 campaign .\nThe governor stressed that he doesn \u2019 t want to hire anyone just because they want to work on a presidential campaign . He needs them to believe in the cause .\n\u201c You can \u2019 t win like that , \u201d he said . \u201c You \u2019 re better to have a very loyal group of people that are really with you that may be smaller in number than it is to have a huge crowd of people that you \u2019 re paying but who would leave you tomorrow if somebody came along . \u201d\nIf Huckabee gets traction , his record will get scrutinized . While still well-regarded by Republicans in Arkansas , there are elements that could be used to sow doubts on the right . Two years ago , he reportedly said the Common Core standards were \u201c near and dear to my heart. \u201d Now he decries them . In 2000 , Huckabee commuted the sentence of Maurice Clemmons , who was serving time for burglary charges . In 2009 , the convict killed four police officers in Washington State .\nThere are also thousands of hours of recordings from his Fox News show and radio show for opposition researchers , including those in the GOP , to scour . He was perhaps the most prominent national Republican figure to rally to Todd Akin \u2019 s defense in 2012 after the national party abandoned him over his comments about \u201c legitimate rape . \u201d\n\u201c He \u2019 s said a lot that hasn \u2019 t been scrutinized , \u201d said Rollins , his former adviser .\nOne of the things often missing in stories about Huckabee is how central the economic populism is to his message . He \u2019 s best known for provocative comments on gay marriage , abortion and social issues . But he \u2019 s trying to broaden his base of support beyond born-again evangelicals .\n\u201c The narrative that I was almost like a monolithic candidate for the evangelicals was never the accurate reality , \u201d he said in the interview . \u201c If I had been , I probably would have been the nominee \u201d in 2008 .\nHuckabee is critical of \u201c trickle-down economics , \u201d as he calls it , using the parlance of the left . His willingness to raise taxes as governor has made him an enemy of the Club for Growth and other conservative groups .
