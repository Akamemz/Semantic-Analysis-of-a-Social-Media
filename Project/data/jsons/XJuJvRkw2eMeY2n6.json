Tim Scott said of the Texas senator \u2019 s organization , going on to add , \u201c It \u2019 s not going to help my friends who are serving with me , but the truth is the truth . He \u2019 s done a really good job laying the foundation for a really long time . \u201d\nCruz is ascendant in Iowa , largely on the strength of support from evangelical voters and the deep infrastructure he \u2019 s built in that community . On Monday , he beat Donald Trump in one poll there , and he has racked up a number of high-profile endorsements in that state , including from hard-line conservative Rep. Steve King ( R-Iowa ) .\nThe South Carolina field looks to be more challenging , as Trump remains strong and Sen. Marco Rubio , boosted by a campaign staff with deep ties to the state , generates enthusiasm among establishment voters and religious conservatives alike . Polls from November , the most recent available , had Cruz either third behind Trump and Ben Carson , or fourth behind Trump , Carson and Rubio \u2014 and few in the Palmetto State think Carson is doing that well anymore .\nNow , there are signs that the same Christian conservatives-focused approach Cruz used to surge in Iowa , largely at Carson \u2019 s expense , is also making him a formidable candidate in South Carolina , a state in which 65 percent of Republican primary voters in 2012 identified themselves in exit polls as \u201c born-again or evangelical Christians. \u201d Evangelicals are particularly concentrated here in the deeply religious Upstate region .\n\u201c It seems the evangelicals are coalescing , \u201d said David Lane , an influential unaligned evangelical leader , who hosted Cruz on Monday at a private Pastors and Pews event in Greenville , speaking of Cruz \u2019 s support both in Iowa and South Carolina . \u201c It does seem Cruz has got the momentum , and 60 days out that \u2019 s a good thing to have . \u201d\nHe noted that Cruz is organized in all of South Carolina \u2019 s 46 counties , just as he is in all of Iowa \u2019 s 99 ( he \u2019 s organized in every county in the first four voting states ) .\nCruz is ramping up his South Carolina efforts , with his campaign \u2019 s ranks there expected to double in coming weeks , to about a dozen full-time staffers . On Monday , he visited one of his two campaign headquarters in the state , here in Greenville , to join a phone bank . He quoted Scripture and prayed with a woman on the phone as Vonnie Gleason , a volunteer in her 50s , looked on with tears in her eyes .\n\u201c His words are so much from the heart , \u201d Gleason said . \u201c He was praying with her like she was his best friend . \u201d\nThat ability to connect with Christians gives Cruz \u201c a real good chance , because of all the conservative Christians here , \u201d said Linda McCarthy of Greenville , one of the dozens of supporters who crowded into Cruz \u2019 s campaign office to be photographed with the senator and his father , Rafael Cruz , a pastor who is an important surrogate in the evangelical community .\nThat \u2019 s why Linda Hill , another supporter in attendance , sees a path for Cruz in the state , even as she grudgingly acknowledged that Trump continues to lead for now .\n\u201c I just believe in my heart of hearts he \u2019 s going to come from behind and be the candidate for the Republicans , \u201d she said of Cruz . \u201c I pray so . I just can \u2019 t imagine voting for Trump . \u201d\nA big part of Cruz \u2019 s strategy , in South Carolina and nationally , is to emerge as the consensus choice of evangelicals and other conservative Christians . To that end , in South Carolina , Mike Gonzalez is leading an initiative to recruit in each county a pastor who will then be tasked with turning out more Christians for Cruz . That echoes an approach Cruz has already taken in Iowa , where efforts are underway to tap a pastor in all 99 counties .\nAnd as in Iowa , Cruz hosted a religious liberty rally in Greenville last month at which he showcased Christians who have faced business and legal troubles for taking stances that they say conflict with their faith , particularly concerning gay marriage .\n\u201c As far as getting pastors endorsed , we \u2019 re lining them up every day , \u201d said Gonzalez , senior pastor at a church in Columbia . \u201c I would say across the state we probably have 100 or more who have already endorsed . We \u2019 re looking at some strong leadership , pastors with large churches across the state . \u201d\nCruz does not have a monopoly on Christian leaders . Several people interviewed at his headquarters said that at their churches , many are torn between Cruz and Rubio . And GOP veterans say Rubio would have sufficient appeal with evangelicals to make them a part of the broader coalition he is seeking to build .\n\u201c Sen . Cruz is counting on evangelicals showing up in droves on Feb. 20 , Sen. Rubio is running a much more [ traditional ] Republican campaign in South Carolina , looking to be strong in all lanes , \u201d said a state party official who is neutral and so requested anonymity in order to speak freely . \u201c Sen . Cruz must win evangelicals to win South Carolina . Sen. Rubio must place . \u201d\nBut so far , the official said , Cruz \u2019 s strategic efforts to engage the evangelical community appear to be paying off .\n\u201c I like Marco Rubio , and I would be comfortable with [ him as ] the nominee , \u201d said Tony Beam , an influential Christian radio host based in Greenville , who decided to back Cruz after a private meeting in Washington last spring . \u201c The reason I selected Cruz is because Cruz has done more to spotlight issues related to religious liberty . \u201d\nCruz \u2019 s recruitment efforts in the state are aided by LaDonna Ryggs , his state director , who is well-known and well-respected in South Carolina Republican activist circles . Several of his other hires in the state are considered tea party leaders .\nKeep the Promise , a cluster of super PACs backing Cruz , also has its biggest field operation in South Carolina , run by Dan Tripp , an operative from the state who was previously Scott Walker \u2019 s state director here .\n\u201c We always viewed Cruz as our biggest competitor because he was so-well organized on the ground , we knew the Scott Walker campaign had to match or beat what Cruz was doing , \u201d Tripp said . \u201c All campaigns have strengths and weaknesses , but I don \u2019 t see the level of grass-roots organization that the Cruz universe has . \u201d\nCruz started the process of engaging those leaders , and with the broader effort of building a deeply organized infrastructure in the state , earlier than anyone else , suggested Scott , the senator who has hosted many of the Republican presidential candidates at town halls and had Cruz at one event on Monday .\n\u201c His \u2018 trampoline \u2019 is working because he had that strong ground game , \u201d Scott said of Cruz \u2019 s building support . \u201c Rubio \u2019 s trying to catch up , and Trump \u2019 s doing a pretty good job of putting it together . \u201d\nHe added that \u201c Marco Rubio has a strong force , and Donald Trump is piecing it together pretty quickly . \u201d\nA Rubio spokesman didn \u2019 t respond to requests to comment on Cruz and the South Carolina race .\nAsked about the strength of Cruz \u2019 s Palmetto State ground game , Walter Whetsell , an unaligned Republican strategist who had aided Rick Perry \u2019 s presidential bid , immediately ticked off two GOP operatives who had just gone to work with Cruz and said that the Texas senator has \u201c a fairly natural base here. \u201d But Whetsell said that Cruz could also merely be the flavor of the month .\n\u201c For Cruz , this sort of natural connection to evangelicals makes him fairly formidable here , \u201d Whetsell said . \u201c But it \u2019 s just because he is going up that wave right now . You can look back in the past , that \u2019 s a wave that Perry rode for awhile , a wave [ Mike ] Huckabee rode for a while , [ Rick ] Santorum was riding it , maybe it \u2019 s just Cruz \u2019 s turn . \u201d\nCruz is a beneficiary of the previous candidate to ride a \u201c wave \u201d of evangelical support \u2014 Carson . Polls nationally , and Republicans in the state anecdotally , say as Carson has stumbled over foreign policy , Cruz has picked off some of his support .\nRubio , however , has been seeking to raise questions about Cruz \u2019 s national security bona fides , a message that , if it sticks , could take off in South Carolina , a particularly hawkish , pro-military state . Cruz voted for a measure that reined in the National Security Agency \u2019 s ability to collect bulk telephonic metadata and has opposed some defense spending measures because of other unrelated provisions included in the bills .\nCruz has been pushing back hard with tough talk on ISIL and stressing a willingness to do whatever is \u201c necessary \u201d to defeat the radical group , as well as seeking to portray his NSA vote as within the conservative mainstream .\n\u201c In some cases , he may align a bit too much with Sen. [ Rand ] Paul on some national security issues , \u201d said the state party official of Cruz . \u201c That \u2019 s really the story over the next three or four weeks \u2014 will he pay a price for it ? \u201d\nBut for now , said the official , \u201c momentum with evangelicals is with Sen.
