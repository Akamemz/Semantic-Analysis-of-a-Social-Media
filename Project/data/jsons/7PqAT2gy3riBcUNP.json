It was a moment her campaign was waiting for .\n\u201c Senator Mitch McConnell said about you today : \u2018 The gender card alone isn \u2019 t enough , \u2019 \u201d posted Huffington Post reporter Laura Bassett . \u201c How do you respond to an attack like that ? \u201d\nClinton \u2019 s response \u2014 a riposte that the gender card is being played \u201c every time Republicans vote against giving women equal pay , deny families access to affordable child care or family leave , refuse to let women make decisions about their health or have access to free contraception \u201d \u2014 was a forthright appeal for women \u2019 s votes \u2014 and the latest signal that , yes , Clinton \u2019 s gender will be front and center in her campaign this time around .\nEight years ago , her first presidential campaign downplayed any focus on running as a woman . But Democrats say gender is not only a plus this time , but also crucial to Clinton \u2019 s strategy for winning a general election where she will need to boost the turnout of female voters , who are more likely to vote Democratic .\nThe campaign followed up on on the Facebook chat Tuesday , releasing a slick video replaying McConnell \u2019 s remark and then featuring the records of some of the GOP candidates when it comes to issues that affect women : Sens . Marco Rubio , Rand Paul and Ted Cruz voted against paid sick leave ; Gov . Scott Walker repealed an equal pay law in his state ; and Jeb Bush made a comment offensive to poor women back in 1994 , saying , \u201c women on welfare should get their life together and find a husband . \u201d\n\u201c There she goes again with the women \u2019 s issues , \u201d Clinton says in a clip featured in the video , pulled from an appearance in Iowa last week . \u201c Well , I \u2019 m not going to stop , so get ready for a long campaign . \u201d\nThe stance \u2014 and the air of assurance that accompanied it \u2014 played well with her supporters , even as Republicans accused her of doing precisely what McConnell warned against : campaigning on her gender rather than her record .\n\u201c Hillary Clinton has a habit of contradicting pro-women words with anti-women actions . Not only did Clinton pay women less in her own Senate office , but her foundation gladly accepts money from foreign countries that don \u2019 t respect women \u2019 s rights , \u201d said Allison Moore , Republican National Committee spokeswoman .
