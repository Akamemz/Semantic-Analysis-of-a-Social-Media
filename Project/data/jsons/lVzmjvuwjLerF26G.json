Mast, a retired Army Staff Sergeant, who gave both his legs in Afghanistan. Mast was an Explosive Ordnance Disposal NCO serving with Special Operations Command forces.\n\nThe Florida Republican said after his own accident, he felt he needed to keep serving, so he filed to run for Congress to fill the Florida-18 seat vacated by Rep. Patrick Murphy (D.-Fla.), the pro-abortion activist, who defeated former congressman Allen West. Murphy is running for the Senate.\n\n\u201cThere is one close friend on Memorial Day that I think of all,\u201d he said. \u201cLance Vogeler.\u201d\n\nVogeler was a sergeant first class in the Army Rangers, who turned down an appointment to West Point, so he could continue serving with his fellow soldiers. The 29-year-old had deployed four times to Iraq and was on his eighth deployment to Afghanistan, when he was felled in a firefight.\n\nMast said Vogeler was killed one month after the blast that took him off the battlefield in the late summer of 2010, and what made it such a shock was how after so many deployments it becomes a routine. \u201cYou\u2019re overseas every single year, every single year and you don\u2019t expect it and for him to die on that deployment, it always strikes me.\u201d\n\nThe combat veteran, who took a break from campaigning to \u201cwalk\u201d at the May 26 Harvard University commencement and receive his bachelor\u2019s in economics, said friends of his were there when Vogeler was killed\u2014but, even though he was not there, when he thinks about it, he always places himself there with his battle buddy.\n\n\u201cHe was laying there, bleeding out. There was a mortar that came him and hit right next to him. He knew he was about to die and my friends said his last words were: \u2018This can\u2019t happen.\u2019 He was thinking about his wife and his kids and he didn\u2019t want to leave them.\u201d\n\nMemorial Day is not about car sales or the start of summer, he said. It is about remembering the ones who never came home to their own families.\n\nWhenever he visits a veterans cemetery, Mast said he shudders when he hears \u201cTaps\u201d played. \u201cI can\u2019t even say the word \u2018Taps\u2019 on Memorial Day. I hear it played on the television or the radio and it will break me down.\u201d\n\nIt has become too much, he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard it too many times played over a casket of one of my friends with a flag draped across, followed by the crack of the 21-gun salute\u2014that\u2019s what I think about\u2014and more than anyone else, my friend Lance Vogeler.\u201d\n\nRunning as a veteran and interacting with other veterans, Mast said he carries the obligation to share with people the experiences he and other veterans have had so that other Americans understand not only the sacrifices but why it is so important to fix the country\u2019s problems in honor of those sacrifices.\n\nMast said that it hurts the country that only 80 members of Congress served in the military and only 12 saw combat. \u201cExperiences in life absolutely matter\u2014and when you have those experiences\u2014those painful and brutal images branded on your heart, branded on your soul as a result of what you\u2019ve seen in combat that makes your resolve completely different.\u201d\n\nCombat veterans in politics understand what needs to be done to support the military, but they also have a commitment to the Nation that is over-and-above the regular politician, because they have experienced what protecting America costs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to come to this from a completely different perspective because of my experiences, because of my tears for those 67 friends of mine, who perished on the battlefield. Because I have witnessed friends of mine bleed out in my lap,\u201d he said.\n\nMast is running against seven other Republicans in the Aug. 30 primary.",
