One of the first great medicines of the antibiotic era , sulfanilamide was a miracle drug at a time when curing pneumonia with a quick trip to the pharmacy seemed akin to walking on water . When a sweet , raspberry-flavored liquid version appeared in stores in early September of 1937 , it was a no-brainer prescription for doctors whose sick young patients were still picky enough they might reject even Jesus himself if he returned in the form of a bitter-tasting pill .\nBy the end of October , more than 100 of those patients had died and regulators were scrambling to figure out why .\nAll of this has happened before , and all of this will happen again . Today , medical experts and federal regulators are struggling to understand a mysterious lung disease linked to the use of electronic cigarettes . As of Sept. 17 , 530 people have been diagnosed across the country , seven of whom have died . Neither the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention nor the Food and Drug Administration can definitively say what is causing the illness or why a device that was supposed to help people stop smoking cancer-causing cigarettes has , itself , turned deadly .\nRegardless of why e-cigs have turned toxic , historians and consumer law advocates see lessons in the sulfanilamide disaster of 1937 \u2014 ones that go beyond the obvious surface similarities of poisonous , fruit-flavored liquids . Both cases highlight the way consumer protections in this country are reactive , cropping up in response to disease and death , rather than preventing it .\n\u201c There \u2019 s insanely heartbreaking letters from these doctors who had prescribed [ sulfanilamide elixir ] and then watched kids die , \u201d said Deborah Blum , author of \u201c The Poison Squad , \u201d a book about the founding of the FDA . Those deaths were painful and prolonged , stretching out over days and weeks of convulsions , nausea , kidney failure and stupor . \u201c No one had any idea what was going on . The FDA was desperately sending scientists around the country , \u201d she told me .\nEventually , a Kansas City FDA inspector confirmed that eight children and one adult who died in his area had all taken the same medication , prepared by S.E .

There \u2019 s no tell-tale chemical turning up in every sample . Eighty-four percent of the 53 patients whose cases were reported in a study published by the New England Journal of Medicine did admit to using e-cigarette pods that contained THC , the chemical in pot that gets you high . But that \u2019 s a small and geographically isolated sampling . Other than vaping , itself , there \u2019 s no single behavior all the victims share . There \u2019 s no Massengill in our modern story , no single company glowing ominously like a lit cigarette in a dark alley .\nMore frustratingly , said Anne Schuchat , principal deputy director of the CDC , there are several reasons why patients might not be giving doctors an accurate account of what they \u2019 ve used and how . Some are too sick . Some might not want to talk to the government about their THC use . The state of Illinois has begun an anonymous survey of healthy e-cigarette users , hoping to spot some differences between the people who have gotten sick and those who haven \u2019 t .

Even the e-liquids with the most professional pedigrees haven \u2019 t been subject to stringent safety regulations , said Desmond Jensen , an attorney with the Public Health Law Center at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law . In 1937 , Blum said , pro-regulation advocates had already been warning people for years that there were too many loopholes in FDA rules . And the same is true in this case . There were no FDA regulations at all on e-cigarettes until 2016 , and the regulations that exist now are more like swiss cheese than solid cheddar , Jensen said .\n\u201c When you say a product is regulated , the average person thinks about pesticides , food or drugs , \u201d he told me . \u201c There \u2019 s someone making sure it \u2019 s not tainted , or making sure it won \u2019 t make us sick .
