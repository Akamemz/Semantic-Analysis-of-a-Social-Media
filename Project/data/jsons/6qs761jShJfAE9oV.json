It ended in the death of a Charlottesville woman . \u2588\u2588\u2588\nA year after torch-carrying white nationalists at the \u201c Unite the Right \u201d rally shocked the nation by marching through Charlottesville , Virginia , the movement appears more fragmented than ever but also riding a series of policy wins implemented by the Trump administration .\nFollowers of the white nationalist movement , portions of which define themselves as the \u201c alt-right , \u201d leaped to prominence during the 2016 presidential campaign and then drew international attention after the widely televised Charlottesville rally on Aug. 11 , 2017 , ostensibly over the removal of a Confederate statue . The rally 's second day quickly devolved into chaos and ended with the death of a counterprotester who police say was deliberately rammed by a white nationalist now facing murder charges .\nIt wasn \u2019 t the last time adherents grabbed headlines , but there appears to have been a significant shift in how white nationalists are organizing and communicating . They \u2019 ve seen their access to television and mainstream social media platforms limited and have shifted their conversations to more private online chat rooms , websites like Reddit and apps like Gab , creating an echo chamber of racial resentment that still erupts publicly .\nMany of the most recognizable names and faces of the movement , including Richard Spencer , Kyle Bristow and Jason Kessler , appear to be reconsidering their specific approaches , even if they are n't backing down from their beliefs .\n\u201c There seems to have been a dog-whistle call in , saying to those who have these philosophies , that it \u2019 s OK again to promote them , that it \u2019 s acceptable to be public about it , \u201d said Hilary Shelton , the director of the NAACP 's bureau in Washington , D.C .\nGenerally speaking , white nationalists seek to protect a white , European-descended heritage in the United States by marginalizing or excluding other groups . The movement has gained broader public acceptance by downplaying the white hoods and robes of the KKK while still focusing on its goal of a United States run by and for white people . They claim the white race faces genocide through mainstream efforts toward diversity and multiculturalism , a belief driven by the nation 's changing demographics .\n\u201c The hard-core hate world decided that the street-level violence and Nazi symbology wasn \u2019 t a good sell , \u201d said Brian Levin , director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University-San Bernardino . \u201c What they \u2019 re now saying is that European culture and Western civilization is being thrown overboard for some globalistic goal that is not taking care of our citizens . \u201d\nTo civil rights activists , white nationalism is a repudiation of what they say has made America great : strength through diversity , including the acceptance of immigrants from around the world . They say it 's enshrined in the Constitution , engraved into the Statue of Liberty and echoed every time we recite the Pledge of Allegiance .\nThe white nationalist movement defies easy description , in part because it lacks formal leadership or structure . Instead , adherents espouse a wide range of views , from limiting immigration to forcible separation of races . Other facets seek a more militant , male-dominated culture .\nBut Trump 's repeated calls to build a wall on the Mexican border and ban refugees from several Muslim countries have emboldened white nationalists who see stricter border controls as an important first step . They also welcomed Trump 's warning that traditional European culture was being altered by immigrants from Muslim countries .\n`` I just think it is changing the culture , I think it is a very negative thing for Europe , '' Trump said last month . `` I know it is politically not necessarily correct to say that , but I will say it and I will say it loud . ''\nMillions of conservative white voters who back Trump believe former President Barack Obama is largely to blame for fanning the flames of racial resentment and dividing the country . They blame him for the rise of Black Lives Matter and agree with Trump \u2019 s comments that \u201c many sides \u201d are responsible for racial violence .\nShelton said Obama merely \u2013 and even then only quietly \u2013 talked about long-simmering issues of racial inequality that many whites would rather just ignore . Now , some of those white identity groups have seized upon that frustration to drive wedges between racial groups that civil rights leaders have spent decades trying to unify .\n\u201c We have those who won \u2019 t take a look at the full picture , because it \u2019 s uncomfortable , '' Shelton said . \u201c The reality of now is it becomes harder to have that conversation . \u201d\nThat conversation has instead trended toward intolerance and hatred . More than 950 hate groups operated in the country last year , the Southern Poverty Law Center reported , the majority of them focused on white supremacy . The law center said there \u2019 s about three times as many white hate groups as black , and the black groups \u201c have virtually no supporters or influence in mainstream politics , much less in the White House . \u201d\nOverall , the number of extremist groups , which also include armed militias and male supremacy organizations , rose 4 percent since 2016 , the law center said .\nLast August 's demonstrations shook Charlottesville . On the evening of Aug. 11 , hundreds of torch-bearing protesters , accompanied by armed men , marched through the University of Virginia campus , chanting white supremacist slogans . The next day , the group swamped downtown Charlottesville and rioting broke out when they were met by counterprotesters . Several people were injured , and one woman , Heather Heyer , 32 , died when she was struck by a car .\nThat pattern has been repeated several times around the country : a small group of white nationalists march through a city \u2019 s streets , confronted by similarly militant counterprotesters .\nThat 's why authorities are so nervous about this weekend 's planned Unite the Right 2 rally in Washington , D.C. To prepare for any violence , Charlottesville and parts of Northern Virginia will be under a state of emergency through the weekend .\nCLOSE Virginia Gov .
