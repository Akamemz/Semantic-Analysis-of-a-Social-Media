Nothing is made in the U.S.A. anymore .\nThose are some of the reasons why working class whites feel the economy is headed in the wrong direction . Some 53 % of these folks said they are very dissatisfied with the country 's economic situation , well above the share among whites with college degrees or working class blacks and Hispanics . Another 25 % said they are somewhat dissatisfied , according to a new CNN/Kaiser Family Foundation survey .\nWhat 's more , they think their children will suffer as a result . Half feel their kids ' standard of living will be worse when they hit the same age .\nThis gloomy view , however , does n't extend to their own financial circumstances .\nNearly two-thirds of working class whites say they are satisfied with their own personal financial situation . More than three-quarters are optimistic about how things are going in their own lives . A similar share of those who are working feel their jobs are secure .\nTake Pete McGuire of Mansfield Center , Connecticut . McGuire , who runs a landscaping company with his wife , was frustrated recently when he could n't find work boots made in the United States at Cabela 's , an outdoor recreation retailer .\n`` We 're not making anything , '' McGuire said , noting that the few American products he does find are often more expensive . `` I 'd be willing to pay a little more to buy something made in the U.S.A. to keep somebody working here . ''\nThe 61-year-old ticked off why he thinks the nation is in trouble : The national debt is growing . The federal government is doing more to help other countries than struggling Americans . Veterans are being ignored .\nRelated : Working class whites blame Washington , but still want more government help\nHis four daughters will have to deal with all of this . And most of them `` are making ends meet by the skin of their teeth . '' Two are stay-at-home moms and one is a teacher 's assistant in an elementary school . The one who is doing the best financially became an accountant after graduating from the University of Connecticut .\nAs for his own financial security ? `` We 're comfortable . We are paying our bills , '' said McGuire , who recently applied for disability because of back problems that have forced him to cut back at the landscaping firm .\nMcGuire feels he was able to build a more secure life because the economy was better during most of his working years . After he graduated high school , he was always employed -- in textile factories , for the state , in a construction company and finally at his own small business , often holding second jobs on the side pumping gas or mowing lawns . His wife , who has a bachelor 's degree , works for the city of Norwich , providing job coaching for mentally handicapped kids . He has a small pension and retiree health care , thanks to his tenure with the state Department of Transportation .\nNowadays , he feels , it 's harder for blue-collar workers to make a decent living .\n`` When was the last time a factory worker got a pay raise of more than a dime or a quarter ? '' he said .\nWorking class whites were less likely to get a boost in pay than their college educated peers . The poll found some 42 % of working age people in this group said they or someone in their household had received a raise in the last year , compared to 54 % of whites with college diplomas .\nIt 's not surprising that many working class whites have a negative view of the nation 's economic direction , said Gary Burtless , a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution . Americans are often more dour if their political party is not in power . And since many working class whites lean Republican , they feel the Obama administration has made things worse .

''\n`` Everything Obama and his administration does is wrong , '' said Gibson , 82 , who just retired as the owner of a real estate escrow business . `` I 'm not sure Obama knows what he 's doing and he does n't listen to people . ''\nThe president 's actions have n't directly hurt Gibson 's finances , however . He worked well beyond the typical retirement age because he liked it and now plans to live off savings and investments . His daughter and grown grandson are also employed and doing fine .\nBut among his circle of friends , there 's a lot of concern over the economy , national security and America 's standing in the world .\n`` It 's a feeling that everyone is on pins and needles , '' he said , noting that the economy is only growing at a 1 % rate and many people have dropped out of the labor market because they ca n't find jobs . `` You do n't know what 's going to happen .

She also fears the next generation is not as hard working , which will further damage the economy .\n`` All those things together do n't paint a very positive picture , '' said King , 40 , who feels her job in a bank 's IT department is secure . `` The U.S. as a brand is not as strong as it once was .
