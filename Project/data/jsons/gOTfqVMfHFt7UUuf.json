Very little , according to immigration experts .\nCotton \u2019 s press office told us the proposed law would make two main changes on this front . First , among those admitted through a skills-based points system , not only the new immigrants , but \u201c every member of the household of such alien , shall not be eligible for any Federal means-tested public benefit \u201d for five years .

Those applicants are , and would remain , a minority of the overall legal immigrant population .\nEach year , approximately 140,000 skills-based immigrants are admitted to that U.S. That \u2019 s out of more than 1 million legal immigrants admitted overall this year . The majority of legal immigrants are family-based applicants ( others include refugees and diversity applicants ) . The RAISE Act is expected to halve legal immigration by limiting family-based immigration to minor children and spouses , leaving out siblings and adult children of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents . It also would cap the president \u2019 s authority to accept refugees at 50,000 per year .

So the provision that extends a prohibition on welfare benefits to entire households of skills-based immigrants would affect less than a third of applicants in the future , if the bill were to become law .\nThe RAISE Act also would require sponsors of green card holders to reimburse the federal government for any public benefits used by those immigrants before they can become naturalized U.S. citizens .
