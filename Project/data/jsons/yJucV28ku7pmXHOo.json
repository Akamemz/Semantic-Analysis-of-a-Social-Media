    "content": "American schoolchildren are heading back to the classroom amid an intensifying debate as shrill with urgency as the bell urging them to their desks : how to ensure that they will be able to compete in a global market when they graduate .\nStudy after study in recent years suggests that American children fall well behind kids from Seoul to Helsinki , putting them at a great disadvantage in an increasingly knowledge-driven and global economy . The United States ranked 30th in mathematics literacy , 20th in science , and 14th in reading in the 2009 Program for International Student Assessment ( PISA ) , a test administered every three years by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) . In math , noted a February report to the US Education Department by the Equity and Excellence Commission , `` only one in four of America 's 52 million K-12 students is performing on par today with the average student in the highest-performing school systems in the world . ''\nThese shortcomings take their toll on the economy . In a 2010 study , Eric Hanushek of Stanford University and Ludger Woessmann of the University of Munich charted a correlation between gross domestic product and PISA scores : They posited that it would take the US 20 years to implement the kind of reforms that would enable it to reach Finnish levels \u2013 and that , if the US did that , its GDP would grow by 700 percent by the end of the century .\nThe Monitor looked at five lauded programs around the globe that hold lessons in areas in which the US struggles : educational equity , testing , vocational options , summer learning loss , and well-rounded education that includes everything from arts to literacy and numeracy .\nOf course , no single policy is a magic bullet , and the list is by no means all-inclusive . But it is `` the principles underneath particular innovations [ that matter ] , '' says Marc Tucker , author of `` Surpassing Shanghai : An Agenda for American Education Built on the World 's Leading Systems '' and president of the National Center on Education and the Economy in Washington . `` Principles will travel ; particulars will not . ''\nThere is one metric in which the US consistently excels , show studies by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor , an international consortium of 400 researchers : entrepreneurship .
