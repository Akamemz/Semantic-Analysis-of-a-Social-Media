Such failures can erode public faith in the government\u2019s abilities and diminish public trust in its leaders. President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Supreme Court Justice Owen Roberts to examine the attacks on Pearl Harbor. The 9/11 Commission reviewed the attacks on the United States on Sept. 11, 2001. Congress produced two reports on Hurricane Katrina, and the White House produced a lessons-learned report. These reports reflect a healthy self-examination, and their public nature is intended to restore trust and promote improvement.\n\nWith respect to the Benghazi attacks, the State Department\u2019s Accountability Review Board report to then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and ongoing congressional investigations looking into the Benghazi attack provide important insights into the government\u2019s failures. The staggering number and scope of the findings and recommendations suggests more than an isolated security breakdown. They suggest a collapse of policy, operations and decision-making. Such a collapse, in stark contradiction to election-year claims, could explain why State Department and White House officials felt the need to falsify talking points and deceive the American people about events in Benghazi.\n\nNow that it is beyond doubt that Susan Rice\u2019s talking points were not only inaccurate but falsified, the most important remaining question is why? What were the talking points trying to cover up? Could it really be that senior leadership in the State Department was worried about being criticized by Congress? State Department emails suggest as much, but only insofar as the agency ignored warnings about these attacks. Still, Congress criticizes agencies all the time. Indeed, congressional oversight, by its nature, casts a critical eye on agency activity.\n\nThe failure to heed threat warnings \u2014 warnings that emails acknowledge were known to \u201csenior officials\u201d at least in the days immediately after the attack \u2014 could have been an embarrassing management mistake, or worse, much worse. It could have been the direct result of a failure to appreciate the strategic threat from al Qaeda and its affiliates \u2014 in this case, al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb \u2014 and to align and coordinate our intelligence, military and diplomatic resources to meet this strategic threat. During the election season, that could have been perceived as a serious political problem, not just routine criticism.\n\nEven more troubling, testimony at Wednesday\u2019s hearing before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee suggests that this was not a failure of policy, but this was policy. Deputy Chief of Mission Gregory H. Hicks told a rapt audience that military personnel available to be sent from Tripoli to Benghazi were not authorized to join the fight. State Department counterterrorism official Mark Thompson testified that the State Department (without ever consulting him) did not advocate to the Deputies Committee sending a Foreign Emergency Support Team that both he and the FBI thought could have been made available and had an impact.\n\nWhile the Accountability Review Board recommendations are presented largely as management reforms, it seems as much an admonition to remember the obvious point that projecting American influence abroad must include the use of force to defend our missions. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton wrote in her board transmittal letter to Congress that \u201cthe decimation of al Qaeda\u2019s central leadership in Afghanistan and Pakistan has led to growing ambitions among the terror network\u2019s far-flung affiliates, including [al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb]. These are not new concerns. They have been a top priority of our national security team.\u201d\n\nIf this was a top priority, it certainly did not look like it. This one board review revealed that the administration needed to make significant improvements to meet this threat. Along with 29 recommendations from the board, here is just a sample of new actions initiated by the State Department:\n\nRequesting that Department of Defense deploy personnel to serve on five Interagency Security Assessment Teams for high-threat posts.\n\nTaking a \u201charder look\u201d at the capabilities of host countries.\n\nPartnering with the Pentagon to dispatch hundreds of Marine security guards to bolster post security.\n\nRealigning resources in the 2013 budget request to address physical vulnerabilities.\n\nHiring additional diplomatic security personnel.\n\nStrengthening mutual security arrangements between the State Department and other government agencies in places where they are not co-located.\n\nLike the responses to other government reports and recommendations for remedial action following a crisis, these actions will go some distance toward aligning our assets with our mission.
