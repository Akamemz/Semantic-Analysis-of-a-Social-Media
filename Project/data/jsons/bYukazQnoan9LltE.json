Their purpose is to let reporters ask questions and learn information from those in power , not to cheerlead from the sidelines .\nBut Trump , as has been well-documented , is no ordinary politician ; until recently , he wasn \u2019 t a politician at all . He learned how to make headlines , interact with the press , and disseminate his message through his celebrity , which rewards extreme stunts by focusing on the perpetrator .\nAnd with the validation that comes with being the constant center of attention , Donald Trump learned how to love being there .\nSo it \u2019 s hardly surprising that \u2014 as Politico reported after the conference \u2014 these applause breaks came courtesy of \u201c paid staffers \u201d whom Trump planted specifically for the purpose of making sure those applause breaks were observed . From the second Trump announced his candidacy after descending to a podium on one of his own branded escalators , to the bombastic campaign rallies he held across the country , Trump has most thrived when he feeds off the thrill of a live audience \u2014 instant gratification , in its purest form .\nCandidate Trump fed off applause . President Trump won \u2019 t be any different .\nThis conclusion \u2014 one I wrote in September , after Trump \u2019 s second debate with Hillary Clinton \u2014 is one of the few that has remained consistent throughout the 2016 presidential campaign and beyond .\nHe did , after all , curate his rise through making the Miss Universe pageant and Apprentice reality show franchise all about his outsized personality and the Trump brand . As he rose up through the ranks of more traditional Republican nominees , he cut them down one by one using the most powerful weapon in his arsenal : the ability to make every single interaction he has about him .\nBut the man not only knows how to grab the spotlight , he relishes it . Trump proved as much in his campaign rallies , which fed on a steady diet of throwing catchphrases and huge promises at his voracious crowd in exchange for deafening approval .\nIt \u2019 s why , when the second debate forbid audience reaction of any kind , Trump flailed to find his footing in the uncomfortable silence . As I wrote at the time :\nTrump speaks in catchy slogans . He deflects hard questions to tell stories that make him look good , no matter how relevant . He baits opponents into taking the low road , then takes the opportunity to slam them into the dirt . He makes winking references to behind-the-scenes preparations , to give people at home the feeling that he \u2019 s being realer than anyone else onscreen . ... For a showman like Trump , an audience that can \u2019 t applaud is a nightmare scenario . His campaign relies on giant statements , pointed jokes , and conspiratorial winking . None of these things work without some kind of response .\nLooking back on this piece now after hearing the in-house cheerleading section during the press conference , it \u2019 s pretty clear that the same tactics and vocal approval upon which Trump \u2019 s campaign relied will also hold true for Trump \u2019 s presidency .\nTrump \u2019 s made it abundantly clear since day one that an audience cheering him is one of his priorities . Even after he won , his team threw together a \u201c victory tour \u201d in which he could thank those who voted for him in person .\nIn fact , one of those \u201c thank you \u201d rallies included a moment that is just about the best encapsulation of how Donald Trump both uses and depends on his audience that I \u2019 ve ever seen .\nAt a December rally in Des Moines , Iowa , Trump reflected on how the phrase \u201c drain the swamp \u201d became such an ubiquitous part of his campaign :\nFunny how that term caught on , isn \u2019 t it ? I tell everyone , I hated it . Somebody said \u2018 drain the swamp \u2019 and I said , \u2018 Oh , that is so hokey . That is so terrible . ' \u2026I said , all right , I \u2019 ll try it . So like a month ago I said \u2018 drain the swamp \u2019 and the place went crazy . And I said \u2018 Whoa , what \u2019 s this ? \u2019 Then I said it again . And then I start saying it like I meant it , right ? And then I started to love it , and the place loved it . Drain the swamp . It \u2019 s true . It \u2019 s true . Drain the swamp .\nBy his own admission , Trump only learned to like \u201c drain the swamp \u201d after \u201c the place went crazy. \u201d And so he \u201c started to love it \u201d \u2014 and then he believed it to be \u201c true. \u201d This phrase that he apparently hated became a beloved classic once he got that immediate wave of positive feedback .
