The exact number will depend on how many there is room for in ICE detention facilities , which have filled up as a record volume of families are crossing the border .\nThe officials said they are making the change because of crowding and safety concerns . The conditions under which the federal government detains migrant families , particularly those with young children , have drawn frequent criticism in the past few years . Two migrant Guatemalan children died in Border Patrol custody in December .\nICE \u2019 s three family detention centers can hold several thousand people at a time . Families with children can spend up to 20 days in them under current law .\nUnder the new policy , some families will be processed by the Border Patrol and then released and ordered to show up later to start their deportation or asylum cases .\nThe policy change runs counter to President Trump \u2019 s repeated pledge to end what he called \u201c catch-and-release \u201d at the border in favor of \u201c catch-and-detain. \u201d But as the volume of families has reached record levels in the past several months , immigration authorities have struggled to make room for them all .\nMigrants released directly by the Border Patrol will be given a notice to appear , a legal document that orders them to report to immigration authorities in the interior of the country . Unlike adult migrants with children released by ICE , they will not be given ankle monitors to track their movements .\nFor years the Rio Grande Valley has been the busiest stretch of border for families crossing into the U.S. illegally . Between Oct. 1 , the start of the federal government \u2019 s fiscal year , and the end of February , more than 58,000 such migrants have been arrested in the area , about 42 % of the more than 136,000 nationwide .\nMost of the families are from Guatemala , Honduras and El Salvador , and say they are fleeing violence , poverty and corruption .
