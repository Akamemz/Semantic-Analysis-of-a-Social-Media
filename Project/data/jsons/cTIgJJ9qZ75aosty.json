Talking directly to the camera from a fishing trawler , Nigel Farage takes a concerned and somber tone . The pro-Brexit politician says he has uncovered a huge scandal\u2014migrant boats traveling from France to England , escorted into British waters by the French navy . He is worried for those on board : Once in Britain , they risk becoming \u201c modern-day slave labor. \u201d Gesturing offscreen , Farage adds : \u201c You might as well have a big sign on the White Cliffs of Dover , over there , that says \u2018 Anyone that comes to Britain illegally can stay \u2019 \u2026 We are being taken for a ride by everybody , including the French navy . \u201d\nFarage is a well-known figure in Britain , thanks to his leadership of the U.K . Independence Party , and then his own Brexit Party . Since Brexit was secured , he has reinvented himself as the closest thing Britain has to a Rush Limbaugh\u2013style provocateur . His video has more than 250,000 views on YouTube , and has also been distributed to his 1.5 million Twitter followers and 974,000 Facebook followers . To put those figures in context , after years of decline and a precipitous drop caused by the coronavirus lockdown , no British newspaper now has a circulation as large as Farage \u2019 s Twitter following . Social media gives him the reach of a traditional media organization , but few of its obligations . If you want to understand the conspiracist turn in modern politics , then Farage \u2019 s video series , shot during the pandemic , is a good place to start . His reports on migrant boats coming to Britain are filed on his YouTube channel under \u201c Investigations \u201d and are designed to look like traditional investigative journalism . They even adopt the tropes of British television-news reporting\u2014the sad , falling intonation ; the piece to camera ; the languorous establishing shots of the sea . Read : The prophecies of Q They are , however , better seen as a dare : Unless media outlets repeat and amplify whatever he says , they are \u201c sneering \u201d and corrupt . Farage \u2019 s videos tell a simple story , with a victim\u2014Britain , which is \u201c being taken for a ride \u201d \u2014and a villain : not the migrants themselves , which might trigger accusations of racism , but France , a country typically presented in British folk mythology as arrogant and lazy . ( Look at them with their short working weeks and their Gauloise-smoking intellectuals ! )\nWhat makes the series uniquely suited to this political era is the dash of gasoline he adds by suggesting that he is the only person brave and heretical enough to expose this hidden injustice . Three minutes into the trawler video , he says : \u201c You do get the feeling this is a story that isn \u2019 t to be told . Well , you know what\u2014today , we \u2019 re going to tell it. \u201d Related Stories Something in the Air\nThe Conspiracy Theories That Fueled the Civil War When journalism is hijacked by activists , a phrase like that is often invoked . To paraphrase Ralph Waldo Emerson : The louder someone talks about how \u201c the mainstream media won \u2019 t cover this , \u201d the faster you need to count your spoons . Nothing is so flimsy , so overspun , or so poorly sourced that it can not be made to look like a scandal by conjuring the specter of a vast media conspiracy that \u2019 s repressing it . A story \u2019 s weakness becomes a strength : Other outlets \u2019 refusal to follow up on it can be depicted as sinister . Viewers are seduced by the promise of access to hidden knowledge , which will ensure that they alone know what \u2019 s really going on . The best-rated comments on Farage \u2019 s trawler video give an idea of how his claims are being received . \u201c This should be the lead story on the national news , \u201d one states . \u201c Anyone remember the BBC doing this with our money ? Nah me neither , \u201d another adds . Of course , the BBC has reported on the migrant boats\u2014at least seven times in the past month . Far from being a story that \u201c isn \u2019 t to be told , \u201d a parliamentary committee recently heard evidence on the issue , with testimony from a former head of Britain \u2019 s Border Force . The right-wing Telegraph and Daily Mail have both covered the story , as has the left-wing Guardian . The mainstream media \u2019 s treatment of the story does , in fairness , differ from Farage \u2019 s , largely by putting the actions into context : The French navy has a duty under maritime law to help boats in distress , and many migrants threaten to jump into the water if the vessel is boarded . The navy is then left with no option but to shadow the boats . ( Also , although Channel crossings have risen , asylum applications in the U.K. have fallen since the start of the pandemic . )\nNone of this suits Farage \u2019 s simple , clean story of French treachery and immigrant invasion . The \u201c migrant boats \u201d are best thought of as what movie fans call a MacGuffin\u2014a story element that drives the narrative , but whose actual nature is irrelevant , like Avatar \u2019 s unobtainium or the holy grail in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade . Here , the broader narrative is about British sovereignty , border security , and the alleged threat of immigration from Muslim-majority countries . Farage \u2019 s videos show him literally chasing after a boat\u2014a classic use of a MacGuffin\u2014but he doesn \u2019 t interview the migrants on board , attempt to tell their stories or uncover their motivations , or find out what happens after the Border Force intercepts them . We could call this Potemkin journalism , after the villages consisting only of external facades designed to deceive outsiders . It looks like an investigation , but the conclusion is already determined , and any inconvenient facts are quickly airbrushed . And yet it gains gravitas and authority by copying the grammar of news reporting . It \u2019 s tempting to say Potemkin journalism can flourish because trust in the media is so low . But that is only partly right . Farage is using the form of television reporting precisely because we recognize it , and instinctively believe it . Behind the external facade , though , there is nothing solid . Yet the mirrored hall of social media reflects the facade , over and over , making the illusion more convincing .\nRead : The paranoid style in American entertainment The political right saw the possibilities of appropriating journalistic forms to distribute content more than a decade ago . In 2009 , an American conservative activist , James O \u2019 Keefe , and a friend filmed undercover at offices of the community organization ACORN , posing as a sex worker and a pimp asking for advice on how to run their illegal business . The videos were misleadingly edited : For example , O \u2019 Keefe appeared in stereotypical \u201c pimp \u201d clothes in the introductions , but wore business clothes when filming . The \u201c investigation \u201d would never have been published by traditional news organizations\u2014most of which have clear rules about the use of subterfuge to obtain information\u2014but superficially , it was damning enough to get ACORN shut down . ( A report by the California attorney general , Edmund G. Brown , into the affected ACORN branches in its jurisdiction found that one receptionist \u201c knew it to be a prank and made outrageous and false statements \u201d and that O \u2019 Keefe and his associate \u201c lied to engender compassion , but then edited their statements from the released videos. \u201d He concluded that ACORN staff had acted inappropriately , but had not committed prosecutable crimes , adding : \u201c Things are not always as partisan zealots portray them through highly selective editing of reality . Sometimes a fuller truth is found on the cutting room floor. \u201d ) Organizations such as O \u2019 Keefe \u2019 s Project Veritas continue to use undercover filming today .\nIn Britain , this style has been adopted by Stephen Yaxley-Lennon , also known as Tommy Robinson , a member of the British far right who framed his activism as a quest to uncover the hidden scandal of \u201c Asian sex gangs. \u201d In 2019 , he was jailed for contempt of court after he live-streamed footage on Facebook of defendants in a child-grooming trial . Under English law , the case was subject to reporting restrictions , designed to prevent prejudicing juries in future linked trials . A court ruling later revealed that one of the defendants tried to appeal his conviction by citing Yaxley-Lennon \u2019 s actions . The activist nearly collapsed the trial , yet his conviction encouraged supporters to present him as \u201c persecuted. \u201d Farage \u2019 s story has also been boosted by claims of martyrdom : After he made his first 100-mile round trip to film a video on migrant crossings in April , the police visited him at home to remind him of lockdown restrictions , which at that point forbade nonessential journeys . Farage claimed that he was a key worker : a journalist covering the pandemic . No further action was taken , and he was neither fined nor arrested . In moments like that , or when he \u2019 s hosting his radio show or writing for The Telegraph , Farage is a journalist . When he \u2019 s attacking the \u201c mainstream media , \u201d he is not . The story he is reporting also exists simultaneously in two opposing states : One minute it is totally ignored ; the next he is boasting about the \u201c millions of people \u201d who have viewed his work . All the power , none of the responsibility . ( On June 11 , his radio show was taken off air \u201c with immediate effect. \u201d The broadcaster , LBC , did not explain its decision beyond saying his contract had come to an end . )\nPotemkin journalism has more in common with conspiracy theories than with traditional news reporting . It offers sweeping , totalizing narratives , without the complications and caveats that make many genuine investigations a chore to read . ( Look at The New York Times \u2019 initial reporting on sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein and see how focused and specific the allegations are , and how much space is allocated to rebuttal . Journalists can report only what they can prove to be true\u2014and what they are confident they can demonstrate in court . ) As for MacGuffins , Barack Obama \u2019 s long-form birth certificate is another example . For several months in his first term , American conservatives demanded to see it , claiming that it was being withheld to cover up the fact that Obama had been born in Kenya and thus was ineligible for the presidency . In 2011 , the White House gave in and published the certificate , which confirmed Obama \u2019 s birth in Hawaii , hoping to end the suggestions that his government lacked legitimacy . Instead , the conversation moved on to the next \u201c scandal. \u201d Adam Serwer : Birtherism of a nation This conspiracy theory , \u201c birtherism , \u201d galvanized Donald Trump \u2019 s run for the White House , so it should be no surprise that he has embraced Potemkin journalism . \u201c A lot of interest in this story about Psycho Joe Scarborough , \u201d he tweeted on May 24 about the congressman turned TV host . \u201c So a young marathon runner just happened to faint in his office , hit her head on his desk , & die ? I would think there is a lot more to this story than that ? An affair ? What about the so-called investigator ? Read story ! \u201d The link provided was to a site called True Pundit , which has a well-known modus operandi , perfected during the 2016 U.S. election : running baseless stories and then asking leading questions such as : \u201c MSM Quiet on This One\u2014Wonder Why ? \u201d ( The pejorative use of MSM for \u201c mainstream media \u201d is another tell for activism posing as journalism . )\nThe husband of that \u201c young marathon runner \u201d begged Twitter to remove Trump \u2019 s tweet . Timothy Klausutis reiterated the facts : His wife , Lori , had an \u201c undiagnosed heart condition , fell and hit her head on her desk at work. \u201d However , just like the family of the Democratic staffer Seth Rich and the parents of children murdered at Sandy Hook , Klausutis was faced with an impossible task . There is no standard of evidence that Trump , or his outriders , would accept to prove that Lori Klausutis died of natural causes . Trump is not interested in the answer , anyway ; his tweets quickly moved on . The story was another MacGuffin . The \u201c just asking questions \u201d style of fake investigative journalism is designed to be undebunkable . It is the logic of psychosis : Any attempt to deny the existence of a conspiracy means that you must be in on it too . One of Trump \u2019 s innovations in the genre of Potemkin journalism is to gamify it on a large scale . Those questions act as prompts\u2014encouraging onlookers to join the hunt for the missing piece of the puzzle . Forums pore over \u201c evidence \u201d that contradicts the \u201c official story. \u201d Rather than being passive recipients of news doled out by elite gatekeepers , audiences can adopt the more flattering role of participants in a treasure hunt . For those caught up in such MacGuffin quests , the toll is high . The gamification of the Sandy Hook conspiracy theories led to one grieving father going into hiding , after his personal details were repeatedly distributed by a \u201c truther . \u201d",
