With a few quick pen-strokes on the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo , the Mexican-American War ended , and the landmass of the United States grew by 25 percent . Importantly , that 25 percent included the territory that had , up to that point , been known as Alta California .\nThe central valley of California has fairly unique geography . It \u2019 s been subject to millennia of flooding , leaving hundreds of thousands of acres of top grade soil . It \u2019 s also extremely sunny\u2014nearly 300 days of sunshine a year\u2014but compensates for the lack of rain with snowmelt from the uniquely tall and snowy Sierra Nevada mountains . The combination of these factors\u2014along with huge aquifers of groundwater , more than one deep water port , some navigable rivers , abundant fish and fur stocks , hundreds of miles of desirable oceanfront property , and some gold to boot\u2014all but guaranteed significant wealth for whatever industrializing nation included California .\nThis potential , though not yet realized , was an open secret in the 1840s . The United States attempted to buy New Mexico and California from Mexico in 1842 , but Mexico refused . Undeterred , the United States invaded Mexico on the flimsiest of pretenses and , on February 2 , 1848 , took more than half of Mexico \u2019 s land mass essentially at gunpoint .\nThus was born the U.S. \u2019 s southern border . ( Well , sort of . The Treaty of Mesilla , aka the Gadsden Purchase , added southwest New Mexico and southern Arizona , including Tucson , in 1854 , at a price of around $ 12 an acre in 2018 dollars . ) And thus was the land area formerly known as Alta California transferred from Mexico to the United States . In that instant , approximately 80,000 people went from living in Mexico to living in the United States without moving a muscle . Alta California was destined to be the fifth largest economy in the world , with a GDP more than three times Mexico \u2019 s national GDP . Through this successful conquest , the United States was propelled on its path to unprecedented national wealth , and future generations of Mexicans were consigned to the now-pitiable position of being , in the ( attributed ) words of Porfirio Diaz , \u201c so far from God , so close to the United States . \u201d\nAt first , when this particular portion of the U.S.-Mexico border was drawn , it was\u2014like all borders in the United States , and most in the world\u2014radically open . People came and went as they pleased . The line determined jurisdiction for various important political and civil questions , like legal regimes and taxes , but it wasn \u2019 t a physical barrier . People could ( and did ) stroll across the border at will to grocery shop , visit friends and relatives , work , sell goods\u2014you name it . There were important differences between living in Juarez and El Paso , and different rights and duties imposed on people living within a few hundred feet of each other , but there was no physical wall between them .\nWhat ultimately ended up setting the United States down the path toward a militarized border\u2014maintained via a gigantic bureaucracy willing to inflict violence on anyone with the gall to attempt a crossing\u2014was old-fashioned American racism . In 1875 , the United States enacted its first set of restrictive immigration laws aimed at preventing Chinese people from entering . This particular brand of racism , as is often the case , went hand-in-hand with exploitation . The railroad industry was happy to use Chinese immigrants as cheap labor but the United States couldn \u2019 t tolerate the Chinese community building any wealth or power , and therefore barred Chinese people from entering the country . The federal government detained and then left Chinese immigrants to languish , sometimes for years , on Angel Island in the San Francisco Bay even when they had previously gotten permission to enter . This was the beginning of the end for our de facto national policy of open borders .\nExploitation of other nations and people , both foreign and domestic , was far from new in U.S. history ( see slavery , Native genocide , etc. ) . But it \u2019 s interesting that immigration restrictions rose simultaneously with the U.S. \u2019 s foreign imperialist activities . Over the following decades , immigration quotas were established as U.S. corporations gobbled up land in Central and South America and meddled in the Mexican Revolution . Unauthorized immigration was criminalized just as the United States threatened to invade Colombia on behalf of the United Fruit Company . Anti-Latin American sentiment soared as the United States toppled democratically elected governments in Guatemala and Chile out of fear that they would nationalize industries profitable for American companies . Ronald Reagan railed against immigrants and asylees as he funded the death squads who murdered their families to protect U.S. business interests . The 20th century was an incredibly prosperous time for the United States\u2014that prosperity largely built the wealth that the nation enjoys today\u2014but a substantial portion of this wealth was built on the backs and corpses of people in other countries , particularly ( although far from exclusively ) in Central and South America .\nIt \u2019 s worth keeping this historical context in mind when we turn to Open Borders : The Science and Ethics of Immigration , an illustrated book published by libertarian economist Bryan Caplan and cartoonist Zach Weinersmith . The book portrays itself as comprehensive : it purports to cover all moral and philosophical arguments in favor of open borders , and to neutralize all potential opposing arguments . In practice , the book focuses largely on one \u201c fairness \u201d argument\u2014that restrictive borders are discriminatory and arbitrary\u2014and one \u201c outcomes \u201d argument\u2014that restrictive borders stifle ( economic ) growth . A cartoon version of Caplan walks the reader , panel by panel , through his arguments and their support .\nThe first thing to say about the book is that it \u2019 s mostly lovely . Caplan is an engaging and persuasive writer\u2014in his other works , he can be charming even when advocating for terrible things ( like massively defunding public education ) . Here , he \u2019 s advocating for open borders , a morally unimpeachable policy . Weinersmith \u2019 s illustrations are delightful , and the tone of the text nicely matches that of the illustrations . The second thing to say about the book is that we mostly agree with it . That is , we believe restrictive borders constitute a grave injustice , and that the world would be a better place if people were free to cross between Mexico and the United States just as they \u2019 re free to cross between Colorado and Nebraska .\nBut despite the book \u2019 s clear writing , fun drawings , and correct ( in our view ) conclusion , it must be treated with some caution , as with the rest of Caplan \u2019 s work . Bryan Caplan is a committed and staunch libertarian economist . He seems to be an earnest libertarian economist , in that he appears to have some intellectual integrity and is willing to follow his arguments to their logical conclusions , even when those are at odds with the status quo and the consensus in his profession . But we must be careful to agree with him only where his underlying reasoning , assumptions , and principles are defensible , and not only because we reach the same conclusion .\nThis is particularly important when it comes to open borders . There are strains of left and socialist thinking , both historical and current , that are very hostile to open borders . The ( purportedly ) left arguments against open borders run from protectionist ( immigrants harm the interests of domestic labor ) to supposedly benevolent but extremely misguided ( like Angela Nagle \u2019 s infamous 2018 article , \u201c The Left Case Against Open Borders , \u201d which makes the unconvincing argument that it is better for would-be immigrants to be kept in their home countries by force so that they can organize their way out of oppression . ) Unconvincing as most of these arguments are , they have a kernel that should be taken seriously . Some big businesses do want open borders . Libertarian economists want open borders . Given these unsavory bedfellows , are we sure that we , as leftists , want open borders ? Should Bryan Caplan \u2019 s support for our position give us pause ?\nCaplan \u2019 s case for open borders largely rests on two underlying premises : first , that closed borders are unethical , and second , that capitalism is good and open borders will only make it work more effectively . ( \u201c Socialism \u201d is definitely one of the major bogeymen of his book : each mention of the dread word is accompanied by a cartoon panel of goose-stepping Reds . ) Caplan \u2019 s case for the moral wrongness of borders is compelling , and strongly-stated . The first chapter of his book is called \u201c Global Apartheid , \u201d and the opening image shows the outline of a looming black wall topped with barbed wire . \u201c Immigration laws tell peaceful people where they \u2019 re allowed to live and work , \u201d a cartoon version of the Statue of Liberty informs us . \u201c Immigration laws don \u2019 t merely allow discrimination . They require it . It \u2019 s wrong to tell people where they can live or work because they \u2019 re black , or women , or Jews . Why isn \u2019 t it equally wrong to tell people where they can live or work because they were born in Mexico , or Haiti , or India ? \u201d\nThis line of argument is the biggest strength of Caplan \u2019 s book . He appears to sincerely believe that free migration is an essential human freedom , and correctly characterizes immigration laws , of their very nature , as fundamentally oppressive . In this sense , Caplan is a much clearer moral thinker than , say , the all-too-common kind of liberal who likes the feel-goodery of belonging to a \u201c nation of immigrants , \u201d but balks at the idea of large numbers of poor immigrants moving into their neighborhood ; who tells themselves that immigrants are necessarily \u201c better off \u201d in their home countries than working in the United States , and believes that a \u201c secure \u201d border is a necessary condition to any discussion of further immigration reform .\nBut there \u2019 s something that feels wrong , or at any rate incomplete , about the context in which Caplan enfolds these important truths . The rest of his argument about the moral necessity of open borders boils down , essentially , to the following : some parts of the world are rich , and their residents enjoy many luxuries . Others are desperately poor , and their residents struggle to survive . If poor people could move to rich countries and get jobs there , they could vastly improve their outcomes . Thus , why should governments have the right to prevent people from physically moving from these impoverished hellholes and coming to countries where they can reap the ample benefits of living in more \u201c developed \u201d societies ? Caplan anticipates\u2014probably correctly\u2014that his readers \u2019 biggest objections will center around possible downsides that this immigration will bring to the receiving countries , and so the bulk of the book centers around showing that there will be limited negative impacts\u2014and , in fact , substantial net gains\u2014for native-born populations in a world where immigration is increased . ( Economic data does seem to bear this out , although it \u2019 s hard to feel extremely confident about what these studies tell us , given the inherent difficulty of disentangling when an economic outcome is \u201c caused , \u201d or caused primarily , by \u201c immigration , \u201d or the extent to which the net economic benefits of immigration are premised on the fact that many immigrant workers have even less bargaining power than citizen workers . ) Caplan tries to show that closed borders , in addition to trapping poor people in countries where they can \u2019 t hope to improve their standard of living , also \u201c trap [ s ] talent at the outskirts of the world economy \u201d and thus \u201c impoverishes us all . \u201d\nWhat Caplan doesn \u2019 t explore in very much detail is why certain parts of the world are rich and others are poor . Caplan puts forward an image of the United States as a magnet for immigration because the United States is simply a good country to live in . He doesn \u2019 t dwell on the fact that one very substantial reason rich countries like the United States have so much abundance is precisely because they exploit the resources of poorer countries , or that the conditions of poverty and violent insecurity that drive many immigrants to move to more prosperous countries are directly influenced by rich countries \u2019 economic and foreign policy decisions\u2014to say nothing of the much longer history of imperial conquest and political meddling pursued by the United States and other powerful nations . This , by itself , doesn \u2019 t alter the validity of Caplan \u2019 s argument that restricting the free movement of people is immoral . But Caplan situates an immigrant \u2019 s decision to move in a kind of historical vacuum of rational cost-benefit analysis . For a libertarian , the logic of the free market dictates that people should be allowed to move where they can get work , because it \u2019 s only \u201c fair. \u201d But for a leftist , unfairness is inherent not only the immigration restrictions that prevent people from moving who wish to move , but in the unequal global hierarchy that forces people to leave their countries who otherwise would not wish to . At various points in the book , Caplan also declares himself to be a \u201c fanboy of Western culture \u201d ( which apparently boils down to favoring \u201c reason \u201d and \u201c enlightenment \u201d ) and does some slightly creepy IQ comparisons across various countries , suggesting that worldwide IQ will rise if people are able to migrate to better-resourced areas\u2014avoiding any serious analysis of power by vaguely implying that there \u2019 s a cultural explanation for the \u201c West \u2019 s \u201d economic success .\nEven if we agree with Caplan that open borders are a moral imperative , how should we think about his second premise\u2014that opening up borders will bolster the existing capitalist world order , which is presumed by Caplan to be a good thing ? Perhaps , if we feel strongly enough that immigration restrictions are immoral and should be abolished , we should be willing to countenance the \u201c open borders is compatible with global capitalism \u201d argument as a means of bringing some of our political opponents around to our side . ( Admittedly , most of our political opponents aren \u2019 t ideologically rigorous libertarians , but are ordinary oligarchs with a vague Ayn Rand gloss\u2014so it \u2019 s hard to say how far they \u2019 d be persuaded by these arguments anyhow . ) But adopting some of Caplan \u2019 s assumptions feels icky , and possibly dangerous . Caplan views immigration , in an economic sense , as \u201c economic trade in labor , \u201d which he thinks should be free in the same way that he thinks trade in goods should be free , and writes that \u201c progress always hurts someone , but the secret to mass consumption is mass production. \u201d To illustrate the economic boons of immigration , cartoonist Zach Weinersmith has drawn giant globes made of cash that will presumably be generated by immigrants multiplying their wages through relocation . Even if you think Caplan is right about these things , it feels like typical capitalist magical thinking that treats laborers as statistics and infinite growth as an inherent good , without exploring its long-term environmental viability or actual quality-of-life improvements for ordinary people . Also , accepting the premise that \u201c progress always hurts someone \u201d feels like a license to play utilitarian games with ( other ) human beings \u2019 lives .\nCertainly , insofar as available economic evidence suggests that immigration hasn \u2019 t had the catastrophic effects on wages that many anti-immigration propagandists want you to believe , the potential economic benefits of immigration aren \u2019 t something we necessarily want to deemphasize . But at the same time , if you think that the global economy is deeply unfair , we don \u2019 t want to become too enthusiastic about arguing that opening up borders is the mystical solution that , without more action , will somehow cause the global economy to become fair . Rather , many leftists have envisioned open borders as something that\u2014even if it won \u2019 t be the singular cause of the dismantlement of unjust economic systems\u2014can increase worker power by allowing greater solidarity and organizing across national lines . Caplan , by contrast , wants to assuage public fears that increased immigration is likely to result in any significant political changes . He extensively cites studies that show that immigrants assimilate quickly , vote at slightly lower rates than the general population , and possess political views that are pretty close to the median ( albeit slightly more \u201c fiscally liberal \u201d and \u201c socially conservative \u201d than average . ) But those studies , to the extent we think they \u2019 re reliable , are based upon the present-day pool of immigrants , which is much more limited than what \u2019 s envisioned under an open borders regime . It \u2019 s hard to say if this is a good predictor of how a much larger influx of immigrants would affect U.S. politics , for example\u2014and ideally , we on the left would want an influx of working-class immigrants to affect U.S. politics , with workers from different parts of the world joining unions and bringing their own political and organizing traditions to bear on U.S. debates .\nIt \u2019 s also worth mentioning that although Caplan writes predominantly from a libertarian perspective , he pitches open borders as something that pretty much anyone of any ideological persuasion can find moral and practical reasons to support . His goal is to shift the baseline assumption \u201c immigration must be restricted except under X conditions \u201d to \u201c immigration should be open , and any exceptions should be tailored to the specific immigration-related problems a country believes would need to be prevented. \u201d Caplan calls these restrictions to assuage public anxiety \u201c keyhole solutions \u201d : his idea being that any increase in immigration is good , so we should be willing to countenance ( at least in the short term ) new or ongoing immigration restrictions of various kinds , provided we can gradually increase the number of total people who are allowed to immigrate . Some examples of keyhole solutions he proposes are a ) taxing immigrants \u2019 income to offset any negative economic impact on native citizen workers , b ) restricting immigrants \u2019 eligibility for all but emergency government services , c ) requiring English fluency or cultural literacy tests , and d ) raising proportional levels of immigration from non-Muslim countries ( i.e . calming Islamophobes \u2019 anxieties about the prospect of a North American caliphate by simply admitting more non-Muslim than Muslim immigrants , so that Muslims perpetually remain a minority group . )\nCaplan concedes that he doesn \u2019 t think these keyhole solutions are \u201c fair , \u201d but emphasizes that as long as more people are able to immigrate , the result will still be an improvement on the status quo . There \u2019 s a sense in which this is perhaps true\u2014but it \u2019 s also rather na\u00efve to believe that these keyhole solutions are a natural stepping-stone to eventual open borders . There \u2019 s an equally good chance that these kinds of concessions will just result in the continuing entrenchment of immigrants \u2019 second-class status : by explicitly legislating their position as go-to economic scapegoats for capitalism \u2019 s ravages on the vulnerable , by encouraging restrictions that are tailored to favor more \u201c productive \u201d and educated immigrants over the kinds of immigrants Caplan thinks most desperately need to immigrate , by feeding the notion that certain \u201c cultures \u201d are inherently superior to others and that some \u201c dangerous \u201d cultures need to be artificially restricted , regulated , and monitored . A case for open borders that touts these kinds of keyhole solutions as incremental progress toward the eventual goal , rather than as compromises that could derail the movement entirely by authorizing lawmakers to develop even more intricately discriminatory policies than before , doesn \u2019 t feel quite adequate .\nOne thing that rich , successful people love to tell themselves is that they are rich because of their intelligence , their discipline , and their good habits . It \u2019 s a comfortable , self-reinforcing myth . Wealth proves virtue , and everyone else \u2019 s lack of wealth proves their lack of virtue . It \u2019 s much more comfortable than confronting the fact that vast wealth is accumulated , under the best of circumstances , via blind luck and more commonly by outright theft . The history of the United States and Mexico shows this clearly : the trajectories of our nations \u2019 respective fortunes depended so heavily upon a contingent moment in history , where one nation took a rich territory that had previously belonged to another\u2014a contingency that was then reinforced by many dozens , even hundreds , of additional contingencies , leading the United States to gradually view the hardening of the southern border as politically advantageous . A case for open borders that fails to reckon with past and present exploitation is necessarily going to feel like something between a Pollyanna pipe-dream and a smokescreen for further violent depredations . That \u2019 s not to say that Caplan \u2019 s arguments have no merit , or that there \u2019 s no common ground to be found between leftist and libertarian advocates for open borders . But\u2014in the same way that Caplan \u2019 s comic book occasionally throws out a cautionary vision of a closed-borders world of tightly-sealed , totalitarian socialist states\u2014leftist open borders advocates have a mirror nightmare vision , of a world homogenized and subjugated to the whims of the global rich , where people are free to move where they will but their autonomy in each new place only increases by negligible fractions . If we believe that most countries in the world mistreat the poor , then allowing the poor to move from country to country only gets us so far . Open borders are not the solution to global injustice : they are simply a rectification of one injustice among many , creating the opportunity for a more fully international community to tackle other injustices wholesale .",

There are strains of left and socialist thinking, both historical and current, that are very hostile to open borders. The (purportedly) left arguments against open borders run from protectionist (immigrants harm the interests of domestic labor) to supposedly benevolent but extremely misguided (like Angela Nagle\u2019s infamous 2018 article, \u201cThe Left Case Against Open Borders,\u201d which makes the unconvincing argument that it is better for would-be immigrants to be kept in their home countries by force so that they can organize their way out of oppression.)

Others are desperately poor, and their residents struggle to survive. If poor people could move to rich countries and get jobs there, they could vastly improve their outcomes. Thus, why should governments have the right to prevent people from physically moving from these impoverished hellholes and coming to countries where they can reap the ample benefits of living in more \u201cdeveloped\u201d societies? Caplan anticipates\u2014probably correctly\u2014that his readers\u2019 biggest objections will center around possible downsides that this immigration will bring to the receiving countries, and so the bulk of the book centers around showing that there will be limited negative impacts\u2014and, in fact, substantial net gains\u2014for native-born populations in a world where immigration is increased. (Economic data does seem to bear this out, although it\u2019s hard to feel extremely confident about what these studies tell us, given the inherent difficulty of disentangling when an economic outcome is \u201ccaused,\u201d or caused primarily, by \u201cimmigration,\u201d or the extent to which the net economic benefits of immigration are premised on the fact that many immigrant workers have even less bargaining power than citizen workers.) Caplan tries to show that closed borders, in addition to trapping poor people in countries where they can\u2019t hope to improve their standard of living, also \u201ctrap[s] talent at the outskirts of the world economy\u201d and thus \u201cimpoverishes us all.\u201d\n\nWhat Caplan doesn\u2019t explore in very much detail is why certain parts of the world are rich and others are poor. Caplan puts forward an image of the United States as a magnet for immigration because the United States is simply a good country to live in. He doesn\u2019t dwell on the fact that one very substantial reason rich countries like the United States have so much abundance is precisely because they exploit the resources of poorer countries, or that the conditions of poverty and violent insecurity that drive many immigrants to move to more prosperous countries are directly influenced by rich countries\u2019 economic and foreign policy decisions\u2014to say nothing of the much longer history of imperial conquest and political meddling pursued by the United States and other powerful nations. This, by itself, doesn\u2019t alter the validity of Caplan\u2019s argument that restricting the free movement of people is immoral. But Caplan situates an immigrant\u2019s decision to move in a kind of historical vacuum of rational cost-benefit analysis. For a libertarian, the logic of the free market dictates that people should be allowed to move where they can get work, because it\u2019s only \u201cfair.\u201d But for a leftist, unfairness is inherent not only the immigration restrictions that prevent people from moving who wish to move, but in the unequal global hierarchy that forces people to leave their countries who otherwise would not wish to. At various points in the book, Caplan also declares himself to be a \u201cfanboy of Western culture\u201d (which apparently boils down to favoring \u201creason\u201d and \u201cenlightenment\u201d) and does some slightly creepy IQ comparisons across various countries, suggesting that worldwide IQ will rise if people are able to migrate to better-resourced areas\u2014avoiding any serious analysis of power by vaguely implying that there\u2019s a cultural explanation for the \u201cWest\u2019s\u201d economic success.\n\nEven if we agree with Caplan that open borders are a moral imperative, how should we think about his second premise\u2014that opening up borders will bolster the existing capitalist world order, which is presumed by Caplan to be a good thing? Perhaps, if we feel strongly enough that immigration restrictions are immoral and should be abolished, we should be willing to countenance the \u201copen borders is compatible with global capitalism\u201d argument as a means of bringing some of our political opponents around to our side. (Admittedly, most of our political opponents aren\u2019t ideologically rigorous libertarians, but are ordinary oligarchs with a vague Ayn Rand gloss\u2014so it\u2019s hard to say how far they\u2019d be persuaded by these arguments anyhow.) But adopting some of Caplan\u2019s assumptions feels icky, and possibly dangerous. Caplan views immigration, in an economic sense, as \u201ceconomic trade in labor,\u201d which he thinks should be free in the same way that he thinks trade in goods should be free, and writes that \u201cprogress always hurts someone, but the secret to mass consumption is mass production.\u201d To illustrate the economic boons of immigration, cartoonist Zach Weinersmith has drawn giant globes made of cash that will presumably be generated by immigrants multiplying their wages through relocation. Even if you think Caplan is right about these things, it feels like typical capitalist magical thinking that treats laborers as statistics and infinite growth as an inherent good, without exploring its long-term environmental viability or actual quality-of-life improvements for ordinary people. Also, accepting the premise that \u201cprogress always hurts someone\u201d feels like a license to play utilitarian games with (other) human beings\u2019 lives.\n\nCertainly, insofar as available economic evidence suggests that immigration hasn\u2019t had the catastrophic effects on wages that many anti-immigration propagandists want you to believe, the potential economic benefits of immigration aren\u2019t something we necessarily want to deemphasize. But at the same time, if you think that the global economy is deeply unfair, we don\u2019t want to become too enthusiastic about arguing that opening up borders is the mystical solution that, without more action, will somehow cause the global economy to become fair. Rather, many leftists have envisioned open borders as something that\u2014even if it won\u2019t be the singular cause of the dismantlement of unjust economic systems\u2014can increase worker power by allowing greater solidarity and organizing across national lines. Caplan, by contrast, wants to assuage public fears that increased immigration is likely to result in any significant political changes. He extensively cites studies that show that immigrants assimilate quickly, vote at slightly lower rates than the general population, and possess political views that are pretty close to the median (albeit slightly more \u201cfiscally liberal\u201d and \u201csocially conservative\u201d than average.) But those studies, to the extent we think they\u2019re reliable, are based upon the present-day pool of immigrants, which is much more limited than what\u2019s envisioned under an open borders regime. It\u2019s hard to say if this is a good predictor of how a much larger influx of immigrants would affect U.S. politics, for example\u2014and ideally, we on the left would want an influx of working-class immigrants to affect U.S. politics, with workers from different parts of the world joining unions and bringing their own political and organizing traditions to bear on U.S. debates.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth mentioning that although Caplan writes predominantly from a libertarian perspective, he pitches open borders as something that pretty much anyone of any ideological persuasion can find moral and practical reasons to support. His goal is to shift the baseline assumption \u201cimmigration must be restricted except under X conditions\u201d to \u201cimmigration should be open, and any exceptions should be tailored to the specific immigration-related problems a country believes would need to be prevented.\u201d Caplan calls these restrictions to assuage public anxiety \u201ckeyhole solutions\u201d: his idea being that any increase in immigration is good, so we should be willing to countenance (at least in the short term) new or ongoing immigration restrictions of various kinds, provided we can gradually increase the number of total people who are allowed to immigrate. Some examples of keyhole solutions he proposes are a) taxing immigrants\u2019 income to offset any negative economic impact on native citizen workers, b) restricting immigrants\u2019 eligibility for all but emergency government services, c) requiring English fluency or cultural literacy tests, and d) raising proportional levels of immigration from non-Muslim countries (i.e. calming Islamophobes\u2019 anxieties about the prospect of a North American caliphate by simply admitting more non-Muslim than Muslim immigrants, so that Muslims perpetually remain a minority group.)\n\nCaplan concedes that he doesn\u2019t think these keyhole solutions are \u201cfair,\u201d but emphasizes that as long as more people are able to immigrate, the result will still be an improvement on the status quo. There\u2019s a sense in which this is perhaps true\u2014but it\u2019s also rather na\u00efve to believe that these keyhole solutions are a natural stepping-stone to eventual open borders. There\u2019s an equally good chance that these kinds of concessions will just result in the continuing entrenchment of immigrants\u2019 second-class status: by explicitly legislating their position as go-to economic scapegoats for capitalism\u2019s ravages on the vulnerable, by encouraging restrictions that are tailored to favor more \u201cproductive\u201d and educated immigrants over the kinds of immigrants Caplan thinks most desperately need to immigrate, by feeding the notion that certain \u201ccultures\u201d are inherently superior to others and that some \u201cdangerous\u201d cultures need to be artificially restricted, regulated, and monitored. A case for open borders that touts these kinds of keyhole solutions as incremental progress toward the eventual goal, rather than as compromises that could derail the movement entirely by authorizing lawmakers to develop even more intricately discriminatory policies than before, doesn\u2019t feel quite adequate.\n\nOne thing that rich, successful people love to tell themselves is that they are rich because of their intelligence, their discipline, and their good habits. It\u2019s a comfortable, self-reinforcing myth. Wealth proves virtue, and everyone else\u2019s lack of wealth proves their lack of virtue. It\u2019s much more comfortable than confronting the fact that vast wealth is accumulated, under the best of circumstances, via blind luck and more commonly by outright theft. The history of the United States and Mexico shows this clearly: the trajectories of our nations\u2019 respective fortunes depended so heavily upon a contingent moment in history, where one nation took a rich territory that had previously belonged to another\u2014a contingency that was then reinforced by many dozens, even hundreds, of additional contingencies, leading the United States to gradually view the hardening of the southern border as politically advantageous. A case for open borders that fails to reckon with past and present exploitation is necessarily going to feel like something between a Pollyanna pipe-dream and a smokescreen for further violent depredations. That\u2019s not to say that Caplan\u2019s arguments have no merit, or that there\u2019s no common ground to be found between leftist and libertarian advocates for open borders. But\u2014in the same way that Caplan\u2019s comic book occasionally throws out a cautionary vision of a closed-borders world of tightly-sealed, totalitarian socialist states\u2014leftist open borders advocates have a mirror nightmare vision, of a world homogenized and subjugated to the whims of the global rich, where people are free to move where they will but their autonomy in each new place only increases by negligible fractions. If we believe that most countries in the world mistreat the poor, then allowing the poor to move from country to country only gets us so far. Open borders are not the solution to global injustice: they are simply a rectification of one injustice among many, creating the opportunity for a more fully international community to tackle other injustices wholesale.",
