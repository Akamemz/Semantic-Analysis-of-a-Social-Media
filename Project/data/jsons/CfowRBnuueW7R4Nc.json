The Republicans , despite their folksy rhetoric , are the party of Big Business . For decades , their policies have undermined the economic interests of their social base . They support corporate tax cuts ; they push trade deals that outsource jobs to low-wage countries ; they oppose raising the minimum wage ; they want to shrink social safety nets ; they refuse to invest in America \u2019 s crumbling infrastructure and their pro-corporate policies , which masquerade as small government initiatives , have increased income inequality and put the squeeze on the middle class .\nIf you doubt the GOP \u2019 s indifference to working and middle class issues , re-watch the last Republican presidential debate . Among the many things not mentioned were campaign finance , the wealth gap , institutional corruption and student debt . These are all problems that disproportionately harm working class voters ; Republicans ignore them because their policies are responsible for them and because they don \u2019 t have ( or desire ) solutions .\nSo that leaves the Democrats . As I wrote last month , there are two candidates who matter in the Democratic race right now : Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders . If you \u2019 re concerned with the rights and welfare of workers , it \u2019 s not even close : Bernie Sanders is the most credible candidate . Clinton is conscious of Sanders , so she \u2019 s moved slightly to the left in recent months , but if you look closely at their positions on middle class issues , the contrast is clear .\nIn the last week or so , an image has gone viral which highlights the opposing views of Clinton and Sanders . From Wall Street chicanery to worker-owned cooperatives to the Trans-Pacific trade deal to financial corruption to military adventurism , Sanders is on the side of the working class \u2014 and Hillary is not . And even on an issue like raising the minimum wage , something of direct and immediate benefit to the poor , Clinton is tepid in her support , and opposes a national $ 15 minimum wage \u2014 the goal of the `` Fight for 15 '' movement . Sanders , on the other hand , is unequivocal in backing the Fight for 15 , as he is on most subjects .\nNot to belabor the point , but the differences between Sanders and Clinton go beyond their policy positions . Sanders \u2019 s campaign is voter-financed , consisting almost exclusively of small individual donations . Clinton \u2019 s campaign is financed in the same way every other establishment candidate \u2019 s campaign is financed \u2014 through large donors , well-heeled donors . I don \u2019 t necessarily begrudge Clinton for going this route ; she \u2019 s operating in a political ecosystem that incentives corruption . But the contrast between Sanders and Clinton on this front is striking to say the least .\nUnion leaders , the people closest to the labor movement , know Sanders is the more authentic candidate , but they have a difficult decision to make : Do they vote with their heads or their hearts ?

Individual voters face this choice , too . And it \u2019 s not an easy one .\nI \u2019 m sympathetic to ( if not quite convinced by ) the pragmatic arguments in defense of Clinton . While she may not be as strong a candidate as Democrats once believed , she remains the frontrunner by any measure . And given her campaign infrastructure and organizational resources , she \u2019 s more equipped to defeat a Republican in a general election than Sanders .
