At that time , Ted Cruz led a charge to repeal Obamacare ; today it \u2019 s more about defunding Planned Parenthood .\nThe outcome is likely to be the same : a forced vacation for hundreds of thousands of public employees for a couple weeks , followed by a face-saving compromise that gets the GOP no closer to their stated goal . And some mechanism whereby that compromise lasts through 2016 , because government shutdowns only happen as far away from elections as possible . It \u2019 s enough to make you think that shutdown politics are all sound and fury , signifying nothing .\nBut that \u2019 s not quite true . The shutdown of 2013 may not have accomplished anything substantively , but it certainly helped cement a picture in the public \u2019 s mind of a dysfunctional government that can not do anything right . That , of course , fits with an enduring conservative narrative about bumbling politicians ruining the country for the rugged individuals out there . It \u2019 s a neat trick : make the government look feckless , and then point to that as an example of government fecklessness .\nThe fallout from the shutdown can be seen in a Washington Post poll out this week . When asked whether \u201c most people in politics can or can not be trusted , \u201d 72 percent said they can not . When asked whether \u201c the current political system in the United States is basically functional or basically dysfunctional , \u201d 64 percent said it was dysfunctional .\nIf Republicans in Congress have had any goal over the five years since first gaining back the majority in the House , it \u2019 s to create this impression . Their constant deadlines and ultimatums and false starts and showdowns may look like failures of leadership . But they also serve to alienate people from their government . And ultimately , that reflects poorly on the party that wants to employ government resources to solve problems , regardless of Democrats \u2019 role in the dysfunction .\nTake the current potential shutdown , which will occur in just two weeks without some resolution . House Republicans lack the votes among themselves to extend any kind of government funding past September 30 unless the bill de-funds Planned Parenthood . But that \u2019 s just an excuse , a convenient topic on which to force a shutdown . If there were no selectively edited hidden camera videos relentlessly and misleadingly hyped in conservative media , the shutdown would be demanded for some other reason , from the President \u2019 s immigration executive order to the Clean Power plan for limiting carbon emissions to Obamacare to something even more obscure . The vehicle for shutting down doesn \u2019 t matter ; only that it serves the shutdown purpose .\nAdded into this stew is the fact that John Boehner could lose his leadership position if he attempts to pass some funding mechanism without the Planned Parenthood rider . The House will vote on stand-alone antiabortion measures this week , along with a bill that would cut funding to Planned Parenthood centers that perform abortions . But those aren \u2019 t going to pass the Senate , and the so-called House Freedom Caucus has vowed to not vote for anything that funds Planned Parenthood . So Boehner \u2019 s choice is to pass a budget extension with Democratic votes and threaten his speakership , or reject holding the vote and shut down the government .\nThe public doesn \u2019 t want a shutdown by overwhelming numbers , according to a recent CNN poll .
