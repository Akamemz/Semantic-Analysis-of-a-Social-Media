Politicians did n't fund it . Neighborhood mental health facilities were not popular with their constituents .\nMany mentally ill people now end up in prison . `` Prison is no place for somebody with schizophrenia , '' says Eide . `` However , that 's where they 're going to remain .\nToday , more seriously mentally ill people are locked up in Los Angeles County Jail , Cook County Jail and New York 's Rikers Island jail than in any mental hospital .\nIn jail , they barely get treatment .

''\nAmerica has some high-quality mental hospitals , but they do n't have enough money to give the extended treatment that most seriously ill people need .\nJaffe says , `` It 's become harder to get into Bellevue ( a New York City mental hospital ) than Harvard . If you 're well enough to walk into a hospital and ask for care , they 're going to say you 're not sick enough to need it . ''\nHospitals often practice what Jaffe calls `` treating and streeting . '' The police call it `` catch and release . ''\nJaffe says that a big part of the problem is that governments , instead of treating the sickest people , often offer `` something for everyone . ''\nThat 's a line from Chirlane McCray , wife of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio . De Blasio named his wife director of the city 's program to combat mental illness . McCray promised to spend `` almost a billion dollars '' on `` 54 initiatives . ''\nUnfortunately , most of those initiatives address people who are not very sick . `` They wrap anything that makes you sad -- bad grades , poverty , coming from a single-parent household -- in a mental health narrative , '' says Jaffe .\n`` Blurring the lines between mild mental disorders such as anxiety or mild depression -- and schizophrenia -- is not a bug ; it 's a feature of the program , '' says Eide . `` They believe the only way New Yorkers will support improvements to mental illness policy is if they are convinced that everybody has a mental illness .

'' asks Jaffe . `` Ask any cop what we need , he 's going to say : more hospitals , easier civil commitment , so that when I bring somebody they 're admitted . We need to keep them on their medications so they do n't deteriorate . ''\nWhy then do authorities focus on comparatively minor problems ? `` They do n't cost as much to help ! Serving the seriously mentally ill is a really difficult task , '' he adds .\nSo the seriously mentally ill live on the street or get locked up in jails .\n`` We tend to think of ourselves as a very compassionate society , '' says Eide , `` but a century from now , when people look at the situation with the seriously mentally ill , they 're going to look back on us and wonder how compassionate we really were .
