Out-of-state retailers \u2014 back then the likes of catalogs more than websites \u2014 did not have to collect sales tax because it was deemed too difficult for them to abide by so many different tax jurisdictions and rules .\nNow that online shopping has grown into a $ 226 billion-a-year business , and software makes collecting online sales tax across states easier , proponents of the Marketplace Fairness Act say requiring online businesses to comply with the same rules as bricks-and-mortar businesses is long overdue .
