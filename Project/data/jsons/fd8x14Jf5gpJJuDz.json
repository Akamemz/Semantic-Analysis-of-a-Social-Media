That has evaporated . Support for the law dropped 5 points , while opposition remained firm . Why ? Fifty-eight percent of respondents said ObamaCare is causing overall health costs in the country costs to rise , but a worse harbinger for Democrats this fall : 47 percent of respondents said the law will increase their own health costs , while just 8 percent said they would pay less because of the law . The Post has it right in describing last month \u2019 s results : \u201c That finding was more positive for the administration than most other polls at the time .

But when asked how the implementation of the law , 57 percent of voters said \u201c it \u2019 s clear the law is not working as planned , \u201d while 38 percent said \u201c now the law is basically working as intended . \u201d ]\nPredictive elements - Polls like this matter because they may be predictive , but are also just as important for how they can sap political parties of the ability to raise money and organize . If Democrats believe that the Senate is a lost cause , it would be much more appealing to focus on moving Hillary Clinton farther left ahead of 2016 or even funding a liberal mayor \u2019 s campaign than it would be to shove money at a red-state Democrat whose race may be a lost cause . Or consider this from the Harvard Institute of Politics survey of Millennial voters out this morning : \u201c \u2026less than one-in-four ( 23 % ) young Americans say they will \u2018 definitely be voting \u2019 in November , a sharp drop of 11 percentage points from five months ago ( 34 % ) . Among the most likely voters , the poll also finds traditional Republican constituencies showing more enthusiasm than Democratic ones for participating in the upcoming midterms , with 44 percent of 2012 Mitt Romney voters saying they will definitely be voting - a statistically significant difference compared to the 35 percent of 2012 Barack Obama voters saying the same . \u201d\nBaier Tracks : Pressure \u2019 s on\u2026 - \u201c This far out from an election there is a tendency to over read the importance of one poll or another in the grand political mosaic that we all try to decipher every week .

He called the Boeing donation a \u2018 clear conflict of interest \u2019 that seemed \u2018 reckless and unnecessary. \u2019 \u2026 Boeing contributed $ 900,000 to the Clinton family foundation to rebuild schools in Haiti in 2010 , just months after Clinton had traveled to Russia , where she made what she called a \u2018 shameless pitch \u2019 for a state-owned company to buy Boeing passenger jets\u2026 Boeing won the $ 3.7 billion Russian contract in June 2010 . \u201d\n[ Fashion icon Oscar de la Renta says , \u201c My beloved Hillary , do not disappoint me\u2026You have to be president , okay ? \u201d according to New York Magazine .

We don \u2019 t know the exact figure . \u2019 \u201d\nThe shipbuilder in a new ad from Sen. Mary Landrieu , D-La. , is being sued by the Obama Justice Department for allegations of fraud in fulfilling a Coast Guard contract . A judge dismissed the case , but the administration sought to reinstate it at the beginning of this month , just before Donald Bollinger , who formerly served as the state Republican Party \u2019 s fundraising chairman , appeared in the ad for Landrieu . In the spot , Bollinger heralds Landrieu \u2019 s ability to bring government money to the Pelican State .\nPick Six : Contractor ad a game changer ? - Republicans have their sights set on six seats to win back control of the Senate from Democrats . So which seats are most likely to flip from blue to red ? The current consensus among \u2588\u2588\u2588 First readers : Arkansas , Montana , Louisiana , South Dakota , North Carolina and West Virginia . \u2588\u2588\u2588 First reader Lou Burnett said , \u201c You need to drop Mary Landrieu from your list of six . She has an 18-point lead over Bill Cassidy ( average of polls by Realclearpolitics.com ) and just today she starting airing an ad with Boysie Bollinger , one of the GOP 's biggest donors , supporting her . Landrieu could win in the primary , as she did six years ago . \u201d\nThe Hill : \u201c The League of Conservation Voters ( LCV ) released an ad Monday accusing Americans ( AFP ) for Prosperity of running a \u2018 smear campaign \u2019 against Sen. Mark Udall ( D-Colo. ) , saying the ads are part of a \u2018 big oil \u2019 campaign to elect Rep. Cory Gardner ( R-Colo. ) to Udall \u2019 s Senate seat . \u2018 There \u2019 s a smear campaign going on in Colorado , backed by the out-of-state oil billionaire Koch Brothers , steering $ 1 million into attack ads , \u2019 a voiceover on the ad says . \u2018 Why ? Congressman Gardner supports their agenda . Gardner voted to keep giving billions in special taxpayer-funded subsidies to oil companies. \u2019 The ad is part of a $ 1 million LCV campaign against Gardner . It refers to a recent ad by the Koch Brothers-backed AFP that aired in Colorado against the Affordable Care Act . \u201d\nSimilar ad , different funding - The Colorado ad looks similar to the spots from the Senate Majority PAC , which is backed by Majority Leader Harry Reid . Reid \u2019 s group is currently attacking New Hampshire Republican Senate hopeful Scott Brown for being in connection with \u201c big oil. \u201d But it \u2019 s not without controversy , as WMUR reports : \u201c On Monday , the New Hampshire Republican Party filed a formal complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen 's re-election campaign illegally was in direct communication with a Super PAC loosely affiliated with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid . \u2026 The ad , which attacks Republican U.S. Senate candidate Scott Brown 's ties to \u2018 big oil \u2019 began airing on Friday , two days after Shaheen released a new website that some said was a signal for Super PACs to get involved in the race . \u201d\nHoney Badger don \u2019 t care about Dem denials \u2013 \u201c Serious questions have been raised about potential illegal coordination between Sen. Harry Reid and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen , and now a federal investigation is pending . While the Federal Elections Commission investigation is ongoing , the people of New Hampshire should not be subjected to this kind of misrepresentation on the airwaves . I am calling on co-conspirators Harry Reid and Jeanne Shaheen to immediately take the potentially illegal ads off the air . Holding elected office is a matter of public trust , in this case , it appears the public trust has been violated . Until we know for sure what has happened , these ads must come down. \u201d \u2013 Statement from former Gov . John H. Sununu , R-N.H .\nAP : \u201c North Carolina 's leading Republican candidates for U.S. Senate made lasting points for voters in their final televised debate Monday night , with Baptist pastor Mark Harris seeking to question the electability of his two main rivals for the nomination to challenge Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan . Harris , the former state Baptist State Convention president from Charlotte , went on the offensive against state House Speaker Thom Tillis and Cary obstetrician Greg Brannon in the third debate for the party 's four leading candidates a week before the May 6 primary election . Family nurse practitioner Heather Grant also participated in the debate aired statewide . Harris , who did not confront rivals in last week 's two debates , pointed out Monday that Brannon did not support Republican Mitt Romney for president in 2012 and cited a lawsuit that Brannon lost and is now appealing involving investments in a company . Later , he suggested Tillis is n't committed to preserving North Carolina 's gay marriage ban . The four are among eight candidates seeking the Republican nomination to take on Hagan . Her seat is considered critical to Republicans in winning back the U.S. Senate in 2015 . Early in-person voting continues through Saturday . The leading primary vote-getter needs more than 40 percent to avoid a runoff . \u201d\n[ The latest poll on the race shows Tillis with 39 percent of support , one point shy of escaping a costly runoff election with Brannon . ]\nWeekly Standard : \u201c Michelle Nunn , the likely Democratic nominee for Senate in Georgia , has a new ad that explores her biography . The daughter of former senator Sam Nunn , the younger Nunn points out that while she played basketball like her father , she did not follow him into politics . \u2018 Instead , I devoted my life to raising a family and building volunteer organizations , \u2019 says Nunn . \u2018 And I went on to become CEO of President Bush 's Points of Light Foundation. \u2019 \u2026 \u201d\nPoll : Perdue , Kingston headed for runoff - WMAZ : \u201c David Perdue and Jack Kingston may be headed to a Republican runoff race for Georgia 's open U.S. Senate seat , a new SurveyUSA poll says\u2026The poll shows Perdue , a former Dollar General CEO , with support from 26 percent of likely voters in the Republican primary and Kingston , a congressman from Savannah , with 20 percent . Not far behind , though , are Karen Handel , former Georgia Secretary of State , with 15 percent , and another congressman , Paul Broun of Athens , with 13 percent. \u201d If no candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote in the May 20 primary , the top two face off in a July 22 runoff election .\nNebraska Republican Senate hopeful Ben Sasse is answering attack ads from primary frontrunner Shane Osborn with two character witnesses : daughters , Corrie , 12 , and Alexandra , 10 . The ad features his daughters talking about their dad \u2019 s opposition to ObamaCare , which was called into question by a thinly-sourced Osborn ad claiming Sasse once backed the law . But there are no counterattacks in the Sasse spot . \u201c We always pray for the opposing candidates at breakfast , \u201d Corrie says . Meanwhile , the Osborn campaign is touting today the support of the political action committee backed by the state \u2019 s rural power companies .\nWaPo : \u201c On Monday , embattled Rep. Vance McAllister ( R ) announced that he will not seek reelection to his Louisiana seat in light of the release last month of a video showing the married congressman kissing a staff member . McAllister missed several votes in the weeks following the video 's release , but was back in Washington on Monday for the first time since the mini-scandal broke . \u201d\nCalvinistic congressman - \u201c I do n't have no regrets . I do n't have no regrets at all . There 's a reason for everything , man . There 's a reason that I did what I did , and there 's a reason I got caught ... so there is good out of everything. \u201d \u2013 Rep. Vance McAllister , R-La. , talking to reporters .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 : \u201c New York Rep. Michael Grimm was indicted Monday on 20 counts of fraud and other charges relating to a Manhattan restaurant he owned and operated , accused by federal prosecutors of evading the IRS and making over $ 1 million in revenue \u2018 disappear. \u2019 \u2026 His attorneys would not discuss the charges against him , but the congressman vowed to stay in office and continue running for re-election in the fall . \u2018 I do n't abandon my post , \u2019 he said . \u2026Grimm sent a letter to House Speaker John Boehner saying he was stepping down as a member of the House Financial Services Committee . \u201d\nDoes the bear in this video on the Internet dance ? Yep . Does he play the trumpet ? Check . Does he appear to experience pure ursine delight in his routine ? Roger that . How about a bemused dog ? You bet .\n\u201c What the secretary of State of the United States has succeeded in doing , in what he thought was a private comment , is to echo and therefore to legitimize the worst of the libelous claims against the Jewish state . If there is one minority in the Middle East that enjoys the rule of law , and protection , and democracy it is Arabs in Israel . One out of every five Israelis is a Palestinian , overwhelming they are Muslim . There are Arabs in the government , in the Supreme Court , in all walks of life , in the universities . There 's actually affirmative action if you are a Palestinian in the universities . And to compare that in any way with the systematic discrimination against black Africans in South Africa is truly appalling and hurtful . \u2013 Charles Krauthammer on \u201c Special Report with Bret Baier \u201d\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for \u2588\u2588\u2588 .

He called the Boeing donation a \u2018clear conflict of interest\u2019 that seemed \u2018reckless and unnecessary.\u2019\u2026 Boeing contributed $900,000 to the Clinton family foundation to rebuild schools in Haiti in 2010, just months after Clinton had traveled to Russia, where she made what she called a \u2018shameless pitch\u2019 for a state-owned company to buy Boeing passenger jets\u2026 Boeing won the $3.7 billion Russian contract in June 2010.\u201d\n\n[Fashion icon Oscar de la Renta says, \u201cMy beloved Hillary, do not disappoint me\u2026You have to be president, okay?\u201d according to New York Magazine. De la Renta gushed about Clinton while she was on hand for Carnegie Hall\u2019s Medal of Excellence ceremony late last week.]\n\nDem donor wants in on space contract - Free Beacon: \u201cBillionaire SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said his company could save taxpayers millions if allowed to compete for all of the missions... The Air Force does not share Musk\u2019s optimistic projections for the costs of competitive bidding for those contracts. \u2026 \u2018We don\u2019t know what it would ultimately cost,\u2019 Gil Klinger, a space and intelligence official in the Pentagon\u2019s acquisition office, told the committee. \u2018We know that it\u2019s at least in excess of $370 million dollars. We don\u2019t know the exact figure.\u2019\u201d\n\nGOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR TOUTS LANDRIEU\u2019S CLOUT\n\nThe shipbuilder in a new ad from Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., is being sued by the Obama Justice Department for allegations of fraud in fulfilling a Coast Guard contract. A judge dismissed the case, but the administration sought to reinstate it at the beginning of this month, just before Donald Bollinger, who formerly served as the state Republican Party\u2019s fundraising chairman, appeared in the ad for Landrieu. In the spot, Bollinger heralds Landrieu\u2019s ability to bring government money to the Pelican State.\n\nPick Six: Contractor ad a game changer? - Republicans have their sights set on six seats to win back control of the Senate from Democrats. So which seats are most likely to flip from blue to red? The current consensus among Fox News First readers: Arkansas, Montana, Louisiana, South Dakota, North Carolina and West Virginia. Fox News First reader Lou Burnett said, \u201cYou need to drop Mary Landrieu from your list of six. She has an 18-point lead over Bill Cassidy (average of polls by Realclearpolitics.com) and just today she starting airing an ad with Boysie Bollinger, one of the GOP's biggest donors, supporting her. Landrieu could win in the primary, as she did six years ago.\u201d\n\n[Ed. note: Even Democratic pollsters find Landrieu far from the 50 percent threshold to win the seat outright in the August primary. Barring an unforeseen GOP implosion, she will certainly have to fight all the way to the end to keep her seat. You may be right that other Democrat-held seats are more vulnerable than Louisiana, but she is surely facing a long, hard haul.]\n\nShare your top six picks.

Mark Udall (D-Colo.), saying the ads are part of a \u2018big oil\u2019 campaign to elect Rep. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) to Udall\u2019s Senate seat. \u2018There\u2019s a smear campaign going on in Colorado, backed by the out-of-state oil billionaire Koch Brothers, steering $1 million into attack ads,\u2019 a voiceover on the ad says. \u2018Why? Congressman Gardner supports their agenda. Gardner voted to keep giving billions in special taxpayer-funded subsidies to oil companies.\u2019 The ad is part of a $1 million LCV campaign against Gardner. It refers to a recent ad by the Koch Brothers-backed AFP that aired in Colorado against the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nSimilar ad, different funding - The Colorado ad looks similar to the spots from the Senate Majority PAC, which is backed by Majority Leader Harry Reid. Reid\u2019s group is currently attacking New Hampshire Republican Senate hopeful Scott Brown for being in connection with \u201cbig oil.\u201d But it\u2019s not without controversy, as WMUR reports: \u201cOn Monday, the New Hampshire Republican Party filed a formal complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen's re-election campaign illegally was in direct communication with a Super PAC loosely affiliated with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. \u2026 The ad, which attacks Republican U.S. Senate candidate Scott Brown's ties to \u2018big oil\u2019 began airing on Friday, two days after Shaheen released a new website that some said was a signal for Super PACs to get involved in the race.\u201d\n\nHoney Badger don\u2019t care about Dem denials \u2013 \u201cSerious questions have been raised about potential illegal coordination between Sen. Harry Reid and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, and now a federal investigation is pending. While the Federal Elections Commission investigation is ongoing, the people of New Hampshire should not be subjected to this kind of misrepresentation on the airwaves. I am calling on co-conspirators Harry Reid and Jeanne Shaheen to immediately take the potentially illegal ads off the air. Holding elected office is a matter of public trust, in this case, it appears the public trust has been violated. Until we know for sure what has happened, these ads must come down.\u201d \u2013 Statement from former Gov. John H. Sununu, R-N.H.\n\nN.C. PRIMARY LOOKS LIKE A NAIL-BITER\n\nAP: \u201cNorth Carolina's leading Republican candidates for U.S. Senate made lasting points for voters in their final televised debate Monday night, with Baptist pastor Mark Harris seeking to question the electability of his two main rivals for the nomination to challenge Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan. Harris, the former state Baptist State Convention president from Charlotte, went on the offensive against state House Speaker Thom Tillis and Cary obstetrician Greg Brannon in the third debate for the party's four leading candidates a week before the May 6 primary election. Family nurse practitioner Heather Grant also participated in the debate aired statewide. Harris, who did not confront rivals in last week's two debates, pointed out Monday that Brannon did not support Republican Mitt Romney for president in 2012 and cited a lawsuit that Brannon lost and is now appealing involving investments in a company. Later, he suggested Tillis isn't committed to preserving North Carolina's gay marriage ban. The four are among eight candidates seeking the Republican nomination to take on Hagan. Her seat is considered critical to Republicans in winning back the U.S. Senate in 2015. Early in-person voting continues through Saturday. The leading primary vote-getter needs more than 40 percent to avoid a runoff.\u201d\n\n[The latest poll on the race shows Tillis with 39 percent of support, one point shy of escaping a costly runoff election with Brannon.]\n\nNUNN DEBUTS DAD AD IN GEORGIA\n\nWeekly Standard: \u201cMichelle Nunn, the likely Democratic nominee for Senate in Georgia, has a new ad that explores her biography. The daughter of former senator Sam Nunn, the younger Nunn points out that while she played basketball like her father, she did not follow him into politics. \u2018Instead, I devoted my life to raising a family and building volunteer organizations,\u2019 says Nunn. \u2018And I went on to become CEO of President Bush's Points of Light Foundation.\u2019\u2026\u201d\n\nPoll: Perdue, Kingston headed for runoff - WMAZ: \u201cDavid Perdue and Jack Kingston may be headed to a Republican runoff race for Georgia's open U.S. Senate seat, a new SurveyUSA poll says\u2026The poll shows Perdue, a former Dollar General CEO, with support from 26 percent of likely voters in the Republican primary and Kingston, a congressman from Savannah, with 20 percent. Not far behind, though, are Karen Handel, former Georgia Secretary of State, with 15 percent, and another congressman, Paul Broun of Athens, with 13 percent.\u201d If no candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote in the May 20 primary, the top two face off in a July 22 runoff election.\n\nCANDIDATE\u2019S PRE-TEEN DAUGHTER: DAD \u2018DESPISES\u2019 OBAMACARE\n\nNebraska Republican Senate hopeful Ben Sasse is answering attack ads from primary frontrunner Shane Osborn with two character witnesses: daughters, Corrie, 12, and Alexandra, 10. The ad features his daughters talking about their dad\u2019s opposition to ObamaCare, which was called into question by a thinly-sourced Osborn ad claiming Sasse once backed the law. But there are no counterattacks in the Sasse spot. \u201cWe always pray for the opposing candidates at breakfast,\u201d Corrie says. Meanwhile, the Osborn campaign is touting today the support of the political action committee backed by the state\u2019s rural power companies.\n\nMCALLISTER DUCKING OUT\n\nWaPo: \u201cOn Monday, embattled Rep. Vance McAllister (R) announced that he will not seek reelection to his Louisiana seat in light of the release last month of a video showing the married congressman kissing a staff member. McAllister missed several votes in the weeks following the video's release, but was back in Washington on Monday for the first time since the mini-scandal broke.\u201d\n\nCalvinistic congressman - \u201cI don't have no regrets. I don't have no regrets at all. There's a reason for everything, man. There's a reason that I did what I did, and there's a reason I got caught... so there is good out of everything.\u201d \u2013 Rep. Vance McAllister, R-La., talking to reporters.\n\nGRIMM-LY HANGING ON\n\nFox News: \u201cNew York Rep. Michael Grimm was indicted Monday on 20 counts of fraud and other charges relating to a Manhattan restaurant he owned and operated, accused by federal prosecutors of evading the IRS and making over $1 million in revenue \u2018disappear.\u2019 \u2026 His attorneys would not discuss the charges against him, but the congressman vowed to stay in office and continue running for re-election in the fall. \u2018I don't abandon my post,\u2019 he said. \u2026Grimm sent a letter to House Speaker John Boehner saying he was stepping down as a member of the House Financial Services Committee.\u201d\n\nTOOTING HIS OWN HORN\n\nDoes the bear in this video on the Internet dance? Yep. Does he play the trumpet? Check. Does he appear to experience pure ursine delight in his routine? Roger that. How about a bemused dog? You bet.\n\nAND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\n\u201cWhat the secretary of State of the United States has succeeded in doing, in what he thought was a private comment, is to echo and therefore to legitimize the worst of the libelous claims against the Jewish state. If there is one minority in the Middle East that enjoys the rule of law, and protection, and democracy it is Arabs in Israel. One out of every five Israelis is a Palestinian, overwhelming they are Muslim. There are Arabs in the government, in the Supreme Court, in all walks of life, in the universities. There's actually affirmative action if you are a Palestinian in the universities. And to compare that in any way with the systematic discrimination against black Africans in South Africa is truly appalling and hurtful. \u2013 Charles Krauthammer on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
