He said, \u201cProbably failing to plan for the day after what I think was the right thing to do in intervening in Libya.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s mighty tempting to deride that statement by going through the long litany of Mr. Obama\u2019s mistakes in national security and foreign policy. But surrendering to that temptation would cause us to miss the important elements in what Mr. Obama said and why he said it. More difficult, and far more important, is an analysis to determine why Mr. Obama is incapable of learning from such mistakes.\n\nBegin with the advice he received from his top defense advisers before going into Libya. According to \u201cDuty,\u201d the memoir of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. Mr. Gates had determined that we had no vital national security interest in Libya and so advised the president. Again, according to Mr. Gates\u2019 memoir, the final decision on intervention was made in a meeting between Mr. Gates and his team, including Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen, and the State Department and White House teams led by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, National Security Adviser Susan Rice and two of her staffers, Samantha Power (now U.N. ambassador) and Ben Rhodes.\n\nMr. Obama, saying it was a \u201cclose call,\u201d came down on the side of intervention to prevent a humanitarian disaster.\n\nAppearing with Mrs. Clinton on the Sunday talk shows to defend the intervention, Mr. Gates said repeatedly that we didn\u2019t have a vital national interest in Libya, indicating that Mr. Obama\u2019s action was unjustified.\n\nMr. Gates\u2019 point is so fundamental to American defense and foreign policy that it beggars the imagination that we need to be reminded of it. Like several presidents before him Mr. Obama has misunderstood it, but the principle is precise and clear: the United States should never go to war unless a vital national security interest is at stake.\n\nThough he often denies it, Mr. Obama is intensely ideological. He distrusts America\u2019s definition of its interests and the rationale for defending them just as one of his principal mentors, Edward Said, did.\n\nMr. Said was a Palestinian activist who became an American academic.

He said America was dedicated to hierarchies of race and to wariness of other nations\u2019 revolutions. He believed American insistence on these concepts obscured, \u201cthe realities of empire, while apologists for overseas American interests have insisted on American innocence, doing good, fighting for freedom.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s distrust of America\u2019s motives throughout history was learned from Mr. Said. Couple that with the anti-American vitriol of Mr. Obama\u2019s longtime pastor, Rev.
