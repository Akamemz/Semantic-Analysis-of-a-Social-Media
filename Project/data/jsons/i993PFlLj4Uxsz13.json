    "content": "There was a time when being a governor was considered excellent experience for the presidency . Particularly if you were in office while you ran for the nation \u2019 s top job . A governor had experience running an executive branch of government and dealing with the recalcitrant , egotistical idiots who populate state legislatures . Having spent chunks of their careers in a state far away from Washington , D.C. allowed governors to claim to be outsiders who could shake up the nation \u2019 s capital when they got there . Even George W. Bush got away with claiming outsider status when he ran in 2000 , and his family has deeper roots in Washington than the trees in Rock Creek Park . ( That argument has worked less well this year for his brother Jeb ! , the former Florida governor whose heart doesn \u2019 t seem to be in the argument the few times he has tried to make it . But then , I don \u2019 t think Jeb ! , in his current incarnation as the most unenthusiastic campaigner for elective office since Paul Warren ran for president of Winwood High , could sell heating oil in New Hampshire in winter . )\nThis cycle \u2019 s Republican primary currently has three sitting governors running for their party \u2019 s nomination , following the departure from the race of Scott Walker . How are they doing ? As of now , the tri-headed juggernaut of John Kasich , Bobby Jindal and Chris Christie have collectively captured around six percent of the support of the primary voters and will only sniff the Oval Office if they buy a ticket to the next president \u2019 s inauguration . By all rights , they should be back in their state capitals soon . But how soon ? Let \u2019 s look at the status of their campaigns and make some predictions !\nJohn Kasich \u2013 Hey , he \u2019 s still pretty popular ! A Quinnipiac poll in October found the Ohio governor \u2019 s approval rating at 62 percent , despite the fact that all his time stumping through early-voting states like New Hampshire and Iowa has left him with precious little time at home . Or maybe his approval ratings are that high because he \u2019 s been spending so much of his time away from Ohio . If he \u2019 s anything like the snarling , hectoring grouch at home that he was onstage during the last two debates , voters might genuinely prefer he stay away . Besides , like party-happy teenagers whose parents are out of town , last week they came close to laying in a huge supply of weed while Dad was away . Party in Youngstown !\nKasich will probably stay in the race at least until he finishes no higher than sixth in the South Carolina primary on February 27 , by which point the hopelessness of staying in just to be the lone voice of reason in this insane field should have sunk in . Though I think he should stay in the race through the convention next summer , at which time he can go back home sporting a 100 percent approval rating from his constituents , making him more popular in Ohio than LeBron James or warm weather . Heck , voters might even change the state constitution so he can run for a third consecutive term .\nChris Christie \u2013 The presidential aspirations of New Jersey \u2019 s biggest flameout since the Hindenburg are not sitting well with his constituents . A poll released this week found that nearly two-thirds of New Jersey voters think Christie should give up on the presidency and come home to work on his state \u2019 s problems ( the largest of which being that it is New Jersey ) . The same poll found his job disapproval rating at 59 percent , which I thought was surprisingly low .\nThe poll also found that while only eight percent of his state \u2019 s Republicans back him for president , 53 percent think he should stay in the race . So New Jersey Republicans are either confused about what they want from the governor or they think the state runs better when he \u2019 s nowhere near it .\nThe irony is that the national press has lately started pumping Christie \u2019 s chances for a comeback , even as his national polling numbers fell so low that he was relegated to the undercard debate this past Tuesday . I predict that his ego will not allow him to drop out of the race before the Florida primary on March 15 , simply because he will convince himself that his performance during Sandy in 2012 will convince voters there that he truly understands the needs of a state that is always in danger of getting wiped out by a hurricane . But after that expensive loss , even New Jersey \u2019 s Republicans won \u2019 t be able to justify sending his campaign money to keep him the hell away from them .\nBobby Jindal \u2013 Forget about meteoric rises . Louisiana \u2019 s governor is in a meteoric plummet . A recent poll from the University of New Orleans found that 55 percent of his constituents strongly disapprove of the job he \u2019 s doing . Add the 15 percent who checked the box without the modifier , and Jindal has a disapproval rating of an astonishing 70 percent . He might even be less popular in Louisiana than exercise .\nIt \u2019 s hard to imagine a harder fall for a Louisiana governor who isn \u2019 t under indictment . Jindal was once touted as the Next Big Thing for national Republican politics . Just a couple of years ago he seemed like a straight shooter , giving speeches telling Republicans that they needed to stop being the \u201c stupid party. \u201d Then his ambitions got the better of him . Now he \u2019 s dragging his one percent national polling average through Iowa and spending his debate time trying to out-nasty every alligator in the bayou . I \u2019 d laud him for punching up , except there is no one lower to punch down on .\nMy prediction ? With his term as governor ending in 2016 , Jindal will find a way to stay in the race until Roger Ailes offers him a paid contributor gig for Fox News . Which means he might still be running after the general election is over next November .",
