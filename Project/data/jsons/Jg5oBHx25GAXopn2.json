''\nIn this most recent survey , 60 percent of the 18- to 29-year-olds polled say they support committing U.S. combat troops to fight ISIS . But an almost equal number ( 62 percent ) say they would n't want to personally join the fight , even if the U.S. needed additional troops .\nThe disconnect in joining the fight comes down to how millennials feel about the government writ large , according to Harvard IOP Polling Director John Della Volpe .\n`` I 'm reminded of the significant degree of distrust that this generation has about all things related to government , '' said Della Volpe . `` And I believe if young people had a better relationship with government ... they 'd be more open to serving . ''\nDella Volpe does caution , though , that this poll does n't dig into the size or the scope of the military campaign that young folks would be willing to theoretically support .\n`` I ca n't tell you that young people support 5,000 troops or 50,000 troops , '' he said .\nHere are four other takeaways from the poll that help us explain the political attitudes of young people this election cycle .\nForty-three percent of the young Americans polled welcome the idea of building a wall along the U.S. Southern border with Mexico . But support differs sharply along partisan lines . Seventy percent of Republicans surveyed supported the wall , compared with 31 percent of Democrats .\n`` This is a very divisive issue , '' said Della Volpe . `` And you can really kind of predict who 's gon na support it based on what their race is and also what their political party is .

Building a wall at the border\n\nForty-three percent of the young Americans polled welcome the idea of building a wall along the U.S. Southern border with Mexico. But support differs sharply along partisan lines. Seventy percent of Republicans surveyed supported the wall, compared with 31 percent of Democrats.\n\n\"This is a very divisive issue,\" said Della Volpe. \"And you can really kind of predict who's gonna support it based on what their race is and also what their political party is.\"\n\nA majority of white 18- to 29-year-olds polled support the wall, but only about a quarter of young Hispanics do.\n\n\"It's clearly kind of a wedge issue \u2014 something that illustrates significant differences in the way that young Republicans and young Democrats view America,\" said Della Volpe.\n\n2. Skyrocketing support for Bernie Sanders\n\nThe Harvard IOP poll is conducted twice a year \u2014 in the fall and in the spring.\n\nIn the spring, Bernie Sanders seemed like a blip on the radar \u2014 just 1 percent of young Democratic primary voters supported him. Now, he's edging out Hillary Clinton (41 percent to 35 percent).\n\n\"The idea of any candidate moving 40 points or so over the course of six months, frankly, is extraordinary,\" said Della Volpe.\n\nBut, he says, it's not surprising to see huge support for Sanders when you line up his campaign with some of the attributes that young people want to see in a candidate.\n\n\"For example, young people telling us they're interested in somebody who is authentic, who has integrity \u2014 these are some of the hallmarks, I think, of the ways in which young people would describe Bernie Sanders' campaign,\" said Della Volpe.\n\nAmong young Republicans, Donald Trump has a slim lead (22 percent) over Ben Carson (20 percent).\n\n3. No labels\n\nSanders is a self-described \"democratic socialist,\" a label that commentators and some of Sanders' opponents have suggested could be a problem. They question Sanders' ability to govern a capitalist economy. Sanders even delivered a speech about his vision of democratic socialism, but, as NPR's Sam Sanders has reported, many young people don't mind the label.\n\nThe Harvard IOP poll finds the term makes \"no difference\" to 66 percent of likely Democratic voters.\n\n\"Young people are fiercely independent,\" said Della Volpe. \"They're not looking at a label, they're looking at a person and his platform.\"\n\nWhat's perhaps more interesting is that for some millennials, the label does carry a connotation \u2014 and not the one pundits may have thought. For some young folks, democratic socialism is a plus \u2014 24 percent say the \"democratic socialist\" ID makes them \"more likely\" to vote for Sanders.\n\n4. Disinterested Democrats?\n\nYoung voters lean left, so it's no surprise that a majority (56 percent) in this poll want a Democrat to maintain control of the White House. Only 36 percent say they prefer a Republican candidate.\n\nThe Democrats have widened the gap over the past six months, when Harvard IOP last polled.\n\n\"Republicans had been making progress, but it looks like they might have taken a step back in terms of connecting their views with America's millennial generation, \" said Della Volpe.\n\nIn particular, Democrats seem to be doing better among younger 18- to 24-year-olds.
