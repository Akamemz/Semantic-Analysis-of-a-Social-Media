    "content": "On a hot , humid June day at the White House , \u2588\u2588\u2588 News greeted President Donald Trump on the iconic colonnade outside the Oval Office .\nDuring our time together both outside and inside the Oval Office , the president had a lot on his mind . It led to a wide-ranging interview that touched on numerous topics including the coronavirus , racial tensions , his poll numbers , John Bolton , the Supreme Court and even accusations of treason against President Obama .\nBut the main topic the president was itching to discuss was his 2020 election opponent : Joe Biden and making sure evangelicals understand what is at stake .\nDavid Brody : `` If Joe Biden gets elected President of the United States , what does that mean for America , exactly ? ''\nPresident Trump : `` Well , I can tell you what it means for your religion . It means choice . It means that you 're going to put a radical Lefty on the Court and that 's going to be the end of pro-life , it wo n't even have a chance . So , that 's what it means . As you know , nobody has been more pro-life as president than I have . ''\nPresident Trump : `` If Biden gets in , look , he 's not going to do it . Joe is shot . Somebody , whoever is going to be running the party is going to put radical Left judges on the Supreme Court and all over the court system . I think I 'll have close to 300 judges by the time I finish my first term , hopefully , a lot more than that , but it 's a record number and we have pro-life judges , and you look at the Supreme Court , they 're pro-life , so we 'll see what happens . ''\nSTAY UP TO DATE WITH THE FREE \u2588\u2588\u2588 NEWS APP !\nClick Here Get the App with Special Alerts on Breaking News and Live Events !\nDavid Brody : `` What do you think of what happened with Neil Gorsuch in the 6-3 decision with the LGBT civil rights ? That was a shock to a lot of folks . ''\nPresident Trump : `` I was surprised . I was surprised . Some people felt that it was a decision that they were n't as surprised as I was , yeah I was surprised . ''\nDavid Brody : `` And John Roberts ? Is he the new Anthony Kennedy ? Or potentially worse ? ''\nPresident Trump : `` Well , so far we 're not doing too well . It says , look , we 've had a lot of losses with a Court that was supposed to be in our favor . This is just to show what it means . You know , you 'll probably have a couple of more judges in the next four years , it could even be more than that , could be three or four . If you have a radical Left group of judges , religion I think will be almost wiped out in America . If you look at it , pro-life will be absolutely wiped out . So if you have that happening , pro-life is going to be out . It 's going to be gone . ''\nDavid Brody : `` What do you make of the state of the race right now ? We 've seen polls , even some friendly polls showing you behind . Do you buy any of that ? ''\nPresident Trump : `` I do n't because I see much enthusiasm right now . I see so much enthusiasm and a lot of it in terms of what you 're talking about , has to do with the whole pro-life movement . A lot of it has to do with that , but I think we 're doing much better than we did in '16 . And I think there 's actually more enthusiasm than there was in '16 . ''\nPresident Trump : `` I just think it . I feel it . I mean , I see it . Now we got hit with this horrible pandemic , but we 've done a great job . We came up with testing , frankly , we test so much that it 's almost unfair , you know , when they say cases were 25 million tests , and other countries are barely even testing . ''\nDavid Brody : `` At the Tulsa rally when the media is hitting you on that where you said , ' I told my staff stop the testing , ' they 're saying 'was that tongue-in-cheek ' or ... ? ''\nPresident Trump : `` No . It 's semi tongue-in-cheek . I say it all the time . I know some people thought it was tongue-in-cheek . It 's unfair . We 're doing so much testing , so much more than any other country . And to be honest with you , when you do more testing , you find more cases . And then they report our cases are through the roof . But other countries , many countries do n't even test with real quality outside of you know , people that are very sick . So we go out and we test 25 million people , which is a lot , you never thought that was even possible . Most people did n't . And we could go up a lot higher than that . And I guess we are , but I tell my people , it 's a double-edged sword because we do so much testing . And again , we have kids with sniffles and all of a sudden we report a case and they 're are in no danger whatsoever . You know , if you look at the numbers , below 18 , very few people are affected . The governor of New Jersey who is a very good guy but very liberal . That 's okay . He was telling me thousands of deaths . And they only had one under 18 . Think of it . One young person who died under the age of 18 , with thousands of deaths so that tells you their immune system or something is doing well . And the one person did have a medical problem . ''\nDavid Brody : `` But just to clear up , there was n't a direct order , if you will , to staff , to stop the testing . ''\nPresident Trump : `` No . But I think we put ourselves at a disadvantage . ''\nDavid Brody : `` I do n't want to talk about the John Bolton book , but he did say something in that book about the media . He said something about you saying journalists should be jailed and then executed . I mean , you want to respond to that ? ''\nPresident Trump : `` He made it up . Look , he 's admitted that he will lie . He 's admitted that . There was a report that I saw where he will admit that he will lie in order to get the job done and he lied . I gave John Bolton a great opportunity and by the way , many of the things he said there were many other people in the room because it 's not like I 'm alone with one person . I have a lot of big delegations with me and they 've got a big delegation . And Steve Mnuchin came out and Mike Pompeo came out and Mick Mulvaney came out . They all came out , and they said , it 's a lie . ''\nDavid Brody : `` On Obama and the spying situation , this idea that they were spying on your campaign , you 've been asked before about what crime he would have potentially committed . ''\nDavid Brody : `` Well , that 's what I was going to ask you . ''\nPresident Trump : `` It 's treason . Look , when I came out a long time ago , I said they 've been spying on our campaign . They 've been 'taping ' , that was in quotes , meaning a modern-day version of 'taping ' , they were spying on my campaign , I told you that a long time ago . It turned out I was right . Let 's see what happens to them now . I never met Durham because I want to stay out of it because otherwise , it 's going to look political , but as you know , Durham is a highly respected person and Bill Barr is doing a great job as Attorney General . Let 's see what they come up with but they do n't have to tell me . All I have to do is read the papers \u2013 the insurance policy \u2013 `` in case she does n't win , we have an insurance policy . '' Well , that was all the stuff that we went through over the last two and a half years . Now we 've caught them . We caught them cold . Strozk and Page , the two lovers , Brennan and Clapper the way they lied . ''\nDavid Brody : `` Democrats ca n't stand Bill Barr . They think he 's political . ''\nPresident Trump : `` You know why ? Because he 's doing such a good job because he 's law and order . He 's got them in his crosshairs , and now we have to see what 's going to happen . ''\nDavid Brody : `` I want to turn to evangelicals for a little bit . Look , you 've done a boatload for evangelicals , for sure . And as a matter of fact , you 've over delivered for evangelicals ... ''\nPresident Trump : `` More than any president in history by a factor of 10 . ''\nDavid Brody : `` Yeah , I do n't think anybody would actually disagree with that . Let me ask you this about the law and order president and balancing that with compassion because the evangelicals that may want to go away from you , a percentage or two , will say they want to see more balance , especially with everything going on with George Floyd and coronavirus . So what is it exactly in that maybe in the future or what you 've done this administration from a compassion standpoint that people should be aware of ? ''\nPresident Trump : `` Well , let me tell you . You have George Floyd . But you also have 14 people killed this weekend in Chicago . So you got to balance them out and say , wait a minute , we need law and order . And it 's run \u2013 all of these problems , Seattle , Portland , Chicago . You could go to Oakland , You could go to Baltimore . What do they have in common ? \u2013 They 're run by Liberal Democrats just like Joe Biden . Our nation will go to hell if he gets elected . Your 401K 's , which are now setting records , will go down , maybe to nothing , maybe to dust , because he 's going to raise everybody 's taxes . He has no idea what he 's doing anyway . You know that . He did n't when he was in primetime 20 years ago , you know , he never got more than 1 % . I used to call them `` 1 % Joe . '' And then Obama took them off the trash heap and it 's a fluke , nobody knows how this happened . He 's running against these other people , whether you like their views or not , they were competent . And he got through that whole mess , right ? And now he 's sitting in a basement , and he does n't want to come out . And this is what we 're going to have . If he got elected , China will own the United States . ''\nDavid Brody : `` Do you think you 're the underdog in this race ? ''\nPresident Trump : `` I do n't know . I think we have tremendous support . I really do . I think it 's the silent majority . There 's a silent majority . It happened last time . Remember the people came out and everyone said where did all these people come from ? And it really is , it 's a group of people that 's massive . And they work and they 're smart , and they 're brilliant . And they 're this and that , everything is good . And many evangelicals are in that group . You know , I got a tremendous evangelical support . I mean Christian support was incredible for me . It was incredible . And I think it should be better because before I was talking , even you said , Well , are you sure ? And I said , ' I 'm sure . ' But now I 've done it . Again . they said I 'm the most pro life president in history , by far , more so than Ronald Reagan . And so now I 've established my credentials , before I was just talking . You ought to ask a guy like a Biden or ask his campaign , give a list of judges , see where they stand on pro-life , see where they stand on it . You will not be able to get that list because they 're going to put an absolute radical Lefty in there in the Supreme Court and other judges . ''\nDid God Pick Trump 'For Such a Time as This ' ?\nDavid Brody : `` I want to ask you , on the evangelical front . I 've asked Sarah Sanders , Mike Pompeo , they all give me the same answer I say , 'Was President Trump put in office for such a time as this ? Did God put President Trump in office for such a time as this ? ' I never asked you that question . What do you think ? ''\nPresident Trump : `` Well , I do n't know what they said specifically . ''\nPresident Trump : `` Okay because Ben Carson said the same thing . You know , Ben Carson came to me because he ran a very effective campaign . And he did a good job . He really did . You know , he came in one of the top people . And he said to me , 'You know , you 're going to win . ' I said , 'Ben , I 'm running against you . What are you telling me ? ' He said , 'You 're going to win , because God put you here for this occasion . ' I said , 'what a lovely thing to say . ' That was the first one that I heard from Ben Carson . And it was during the campaign , I was running against him , and he was saying I 'm going to win . He 's a very high quality guy . He 's done a great job in the administration . ''\nPresident Trump : `` I almost do n't even want to think about it because you know what ? I hope it 's true . All I 'm going to do is I 'm going to do my best and part of what I 'm doing my best on is for the religious community , beyond evangelical , evangelicals a very big part is very important to me . You know , we have great support . ''\n`` I just hope I get tremendous evangelical Christian support and I 'm not saying this as a bragging thing , nobody has done more for religion than I have . Look what I 've done in Israel , which is a big thing with the evangelicals . ''\nPresident Trump : `` In many respects , it is more important to the evangelicals than to Jewish people in this country . But look , what I 've done with the capital of Israel . You know , when you go into Jerusalem , what I 've done . Every president said they were going to make Jerusalem , the capital of Israel . And then when they got into office , they did n't do it . When I say every , many for decades , they 've all been campaigning . And I understand why . Because when I got into office , as soon as they thought I was even considering it , I was called by so many world leaders asking me in the strongest of terms , not to do it . And they all changed their mind . Not that they changed their mind , they just did n't do it . I did it . Golan Heights I did . You know , probably the biggest thing I did for Israel was Iran , breaking up that horrible deal made by President Obama $ 150 billion , $ 1.8 billion in cash . So I 've done a lot for religion , and I 've done a lot for the evangelicals , and I hope we can have your support and if Biden gets even 1 % , it would be terrible . And you can forget about the pro-life movement because it 'll be , it will be over . ''\nDavid Brody : `` Mr. President , your time is valuable . Thank you . ''\nWe encourage readers who wish to comment on our material to do so through our Facebook , Twitter , YouTube , and Instagram accounts . God bless you and keep you in His truth .",
