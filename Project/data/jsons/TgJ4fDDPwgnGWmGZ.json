    "content": "In 2008 and 2009 , Barack Obama gave two foundational foreign policy speeches , first in Berlin as the Democratic presidential candidate and then in Cairo as the newly minted president of the United States . With his signature self-assuredness , on full display he declared : \u201c any world order that elevates one nation or group of people over another will inevitably fail . \u201d\nI point to these speeches , which are worth rereading , not to rebut his foreign policy , or even to argue with it , but to bury it .\nFlush with platitudes , both speeches were devoid of serious substance ; Obama never had a real foreign policy , as later attempts to coin \u201c lead from behind \u201d and \u201c don \u2019 t do stupid sh * t \u201d doctrines laid bare . The false promise of the Obama approach to foreign affairs\u2014cooperation , understanding , and \u201c international community \u201d \u2014has instead led to chaos , undermining our allies , and an international march of Islamists and despots .\nOn Obama \u2019 s watch , only one foreign policy maxim has held consistently true : abdicating American leadership by neutering American power .\nObama cut his political teeth amongst the \u201c blame America first \u201d crowd ; where America is the problem , not the solution . His speeches hedge on this notion , but the manifestation of his policies hold true : U.S. power around the globe has ebbed , the world has grown more restive , and the number of \u201c hot spots \u201d has skyrocketed .\nAl Qaeda 2.0 has established an ambitious and brutal \u201c Islamic State \u201d in Iraq , erasing hard-won gains ; Afghanistan is poised to go over the same cliff as the administration rushes for the exits ; Iran continues to pursue a game-changing bomb , while eagerly funding terror against Israel ; Putin \u2019 s Russia displays increasing belligerence ; Libya , Syria , Gaza\u2014in flames . The list goes on .\nConservatives have rightly spent years pointing to the dangers of Obama \u2019 s unilateral disarmament , noting that American weakness\u2014absent another international guarantor of freedom\u2014invites aggression . That argument is now over\u2014the president \u2019 s critics , at home and abroad , are correct in their measure of the man .\nThat leaves conservatives\u2014scarred from the Iraq War for the right and wrong reasons\u2014seeking an alternative vision of what U.S. foreign policy could be in 2017 ( George Will \u2019 s call for \u201c conservative internationalism \u201d is a recent example ) . The contours of a \u201c conservative foreign policy \u201d will be intensely debated for the next few years , a development we should welcome .\nBut as we start that conversation , we also need to deal with a more pressing issue : what to do in the next two years , as a pragmatic and loyal opposition , to prevent the world from slipping even further into chaos ?\nFor the remainder of Obama \u2019 s presidency , we can \u2019 t expect coherence in dealing with foreign challenges . Instead , we should work to keep the free world from imploding before America can re-arrive on the scene . Our approach should be pragmatic , clear-eyed , and centered on the national security interests of America and our allies .\nIn short , we should fight to ensure America keeps \u201c mowing the lawn. \u201d As this administration willfully sits on the porch of history and sips a beer , the seeds of international radicalism are exploding . We don \u2019 t have time to wait for ideological pesticides or economic weed-control\u2014we need to cut the grass now , before it engulfs the entire lawn . You get the analogy : radical Islamists are the grass , America is the lawn-mower , and we need to cut them down\u2014to the shortest length possible .\nA pair of Israeli policy thinkers recently described their nation \u2019 s approach to dealing with Hamas the same way\u2014a \u201c mowing the grass \u201d strategy\u2014that , while not a long term solution , is the best-bad way to deal with a \u201c protracted intractable conflict. \u201d America faces the same long-war from radical Islamists . Mowing the grass means the focus will not be on defeating dangerous actors\u2014like the Islamic State , Al Qaeda , the Taliban ( Afghanistan and Pakistan-type ) , Hezbollah , Al Nusra Front and others\u2014but merely on degrading their ability to strike U.S. interests .\nThis pragmatic , if blunt , approach requires military assets America still has : power-projection platforms , small , regional footprints , intelligence networks , technological advantages , highly skilled operators , and a Congressional \u201c authorization for use of military force against terrorists. \u201d It also includes influence the White House can still muster : collaboration with global and local allies and shoring up congressional will . For years , America has quietly been \u201c at war \u201d with radical Islamists in Yemen who seek international reach , yet the public shrugs . Why not replicate this approach elsewhere ?\nPreferably , diplomatic progress , economic incentives , and international cooperation would suffice ; but as Obama has discovered the hard way , the world exists as it is\u2014not as we wish it to be .

As such , mowing the lawn\u2014killing those who seek to destroy us , our allies , and our way of life\u2014is the most judicious application of U.S power in the next two years . The president has shown a begrudging willingness to use this power in the past ( see Bin Laden raid and drone strikes ) and has an incentive not to leave the world completely aflame in 2017 .\nThis approach won \u2019 t work everywhere\u2014it doesn \u2019 t provide a satisfying answer for meeting Putin \u2019 s aggression in Ukraine , for instance , or for dealing with the inevitable next round of madness from North Korea .
