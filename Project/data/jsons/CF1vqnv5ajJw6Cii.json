Sadler , who retired recently after four decades in FOIA operations at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration . `` You just do n't have enough resources . ''\nA recent review of thousands of federal court records conducted by Syracuse University 's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse found that media organizations were filing fewer lawsuits challenging federal government secrecy than in past years . The study , which compared the last four years of the George W. Bush administration with the first term of the Obama administration , found that news organization lawsuits dropped from 22 to 18 . This stood out against the total number of FOIA suits brought by all plaintiffs , which was higher during the first Obama term than the last years of Bush 's tenure .\nIn a separate examination published late last year , Syracuse researchers found that more FOIA lawsuits \u2013 422 \u2013 were filed against the federal government in fiscal year 2014 than in any year since 2001 .

Advocacy groups such as the left-leaning Public Citizen and the right-leaning Judicial Watch are also more likely to sue under FOIA laws than many media organizations .\n`` I do think there has been a move away from serious investigative reporting '' by traditional media , says Thomas Susman , director of the American Bar Association 's Government Affairs Office and a former Justice Department official who assisted in implementing the FOIA law in the late 1960s .\nSusman , who also served as chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee , says the protracted FOIA process and apparent indifference displayed by judges to resolving matters quickly might discourage traditional news organizations from legal challenges .\n`` At the Justice Department , there has never been incentive other than to slow-walk these cases , '' he says . `` They know the media does n't have staying power .

It filed about 45 federal FOIA-related lawsuits in 2014 after agencies balked at providing records it had requested , says Michael Bekesha , an attorney for the group .\nJudicial Watch last year dislodged from the Internal Revenue Service numerous e-mail communications concerning what the agency has called inappropriate scrutiny of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status . It also sued to win release of 42,000 pages of documents from the Department of Justice , which had claimed executive privilege , concerning the Fast and Furious scandal , which involved a botched federal gun-trafficking investigation that allowed hundreds of firearms to fall into the hands of Mexican drug cartel enforcers .\n`` A lot of our victories are holding the agencies accountable .
