Circuit Court of Appeals \u2014 a frequent target of the president 's complaints \u2014 reversed a decision by a San Francisco judge that would have prevented asylum seekers from being returned to Mexico during the legal challenge .\nThe case must still be considered on its merits and could end up at the Supreme Court . But allowing the policy to remain in effect in the meantime lets the administration carry out an unprecedented change to U.S. asylum practices .\nThe administration has said it plans to rapidly expand the policy across the border , which would have far-reaching consequences for asylum seekers and Mexican border cities that host them while their cases wind through clogged U.S. immigration courts . Cases can take several years to decide .\nThe policy was challenged by 11 Central Americans and advocacy groups that argued it jeopardized asylum seekers by forcing them to stay in Mexico , where crime and drug violence are prevalent .\nU.S. District Court Judge Richard Seeborg agreed April 8 and said the policy should be halted because it failed to evaluate the dangers migrants faced in Mexico .\nThe administration introduced its `` Migrant Protection Protocols '' policy on Jan. 29 in San Diego and later expanded it to Calexico , California , and El Paso , Texas .
