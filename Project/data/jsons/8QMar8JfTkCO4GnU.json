Even Beyonc\u00e9 \u2019 s recent Instagram video , where she talks about Floyd \u2019 s death and advocates for \u201c no more senseless killings of human beings , \u201d falls flat because she repeatedly uses the phrase \u201c people of color \u201d when the brunt of the trauma being endured is by black people at the hands of police . Last year , in an opinion piece for the LA Times , Nadra Widatalla wrote about why using \u201c people of color \u201d as a blanket term for all minorities ultimately serves no one , and this \u201c \u2018 one size fits all \u2019 mentality toward diversity erases the specific needs of the most vulnerable communities. \u201d Not saying \u201c black \u201d when you are , in fact , talking about an issue that largely affects black people is a way of diminishing long-standing frustrations with injustice in this country . Being precise in the language you use is important because it \u2019 s one of the most fundamental ways to show you \u2019 re serious about \u2014 and understanding of \u2014 the type of change you are purportedly trying to effect .

Even when looking past the coded word \u201c eloquent , \u201d there is the maddening realization that in times when black people have more than a right to be upset and distraught , people still want us to harness our anger and present it in a palatable way . Imagine how disconnected you have to be to tell people who have dealt with centuries of disenfranchisement to \u201c direct \u201d their rage in a way that is more comfortable for you . This approach trivializes what people are fighting for and ultimately underscores why things have reached this current breaking point .\nHow is this gesture anything more than a way for people who have unimaginable privilege to reassure each other that they \u2019 re on the right side of history ?\nAnd then there \u2019 s Ellen DeGeneres , who was blasted for what many considered to be a vague , lazy attempt at addressing the hurt felt by black people . \u201c People of color in this country have faced injustice for far too long , \u201d DeGeneres \u2019 s now-deleted tweet read . \u201c For things to change , things must change .
