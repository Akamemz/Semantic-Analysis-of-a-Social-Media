    "content": "Angry civil rights groups on Sunday were pressing for new criminal charges following George Zimmerman 's acquittal on second-degree murder and manslaughter in a Florida courtroom .\nThe NAACP website featured an online petition -- also posted on the liberal site MoveOn.org -- asking the Justice Department to bring federal charges against Zimmerman in the February 2012 fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin .\n`` The most fundamental of civil rights \u2014 the right to life \u2014 was violated the night George Zimmerman stalked and then took the life of Trayvon Martin , '' the petition says . `` We ask that the Department of Justice file civil rights ( criminal ) charges against Mr. Zimmerman for this egregious violation . ''\nJustice Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson issued a statement Sunday saying federal prosecutors were continuing to review evidence in the case , including testimony from the state trial .\n`` Prosecutors will determine whether the evidence reveals a prosecutable violation of any of the limited federal criminal civil rights statutes within our jurisdiction , and whether federal prosecution is appropriate , '' Iverson said .\nBarbara Arnwine , executive director of the Lawyers ' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law , pressed for those charges , blasting the state verdict as a `` tragic miscarriage of justice . '' She also urged Trayvon 's family to pursue a civil lawsuit .\n`` No matter how you look at this situation , if it were not for the actions of Mr. Zimmerman , Trayvon Martin would still be alive with his family today , '' Arnwine said .\nShe said she hoped the verdict would spark a national conversation about racial profiling and the `` broken criminal justice system . ''\nAfter the verdict was announced Saturday night , a clearly shaken NAACP President Benjamin Todd Jealous said , `` This is a heartbreaking moment . This will confirm for many that the only problem with the New South is it occupies the same time and space as the old South . ''\nHe referenced another killing of a black youth that many have compared to the Trayvon Martin slaying , the 1955 killing of 14-year-old Emmett Till , who was killed in Mississippi for allegedly flirting with a white woman . `` Trayvon Martin 's case has focused a generation the same way that the Emmett Till case focused a generation 60 years ago . I had hoped that this time we would get a verdict that fit the gravity of the case . ''\nThe Rev . Al Sharpton , who led thousands of protesters in Sanford seeking a prosecution of Trayvon 's killer , called the verdict `` a sad day in the country '' and `` a slap in the face to those that believe in justice in this country . ''\n`` I think this is an atrocity , '' Sharpton said . `` It is probably one of the worst situations that I have seen . ''\n`` I 'm disappointed and I 'm saddened for the family , '' Jackson said .\nWhile the jury 's verdict was a crushing blow for many , there were no reports of serious unrest by early Sunday morning . Authorities in Martin 's hometown of Miami and in Miami Gardens , where his father lives , said the streets were quiet .\nDemonstrators took to the streets of four California cities , and there were reports of protesters breaking windows and damaging cars in Oakland , officials said early Sunday .\nIn Chicago , about 40 people chanted `` Justice for Trayvon ! '' as they marched through the streets Saturday evening , according to The Chicago Tribune .\nIn Sanford , Tristan Bailey , 15 , who was outside the Seminole County courthouse , was stunned after hearing the verdict . `` I do n't know what to say , '' said the teen , who identifies with Trayvon Martin . `` He was just a teen , trying to live his dreams . ''\nShannon Mickey , 41 , was also disappointed . `` We were all nervous when we knew the verdict was coming down , '' Mickey said . `` It was a sense of shock . And unbelievable sadness .

Charles Williams II , president of the National Action Network of Michigan and pastor of Detroit 's Historic King Solomon Baptist Church , said he planned a special prayer service at the church to pray for the Martin family .\n`` In the South , it 's still hard for an African American to get justice , '' Williams said . `` Mr. Zimmerman deserved at least manslaughter and the jury would n't even do that . There is not faith in the jurors or in the diversity of the process . ''\nWilliams said that National Action Network will examine legal options . `` We 're going to continue our calls for justice for Trayvon Martin , '' he said .\nIn Fort Myers , Fla. , people voiced feelings of anger , dismay and concern about keeping the peace immediately following the verdict .\n`` Oh my goodness , this is unreal to me .
