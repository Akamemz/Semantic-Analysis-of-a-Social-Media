The main plaintiff , the Authors Guild , announced it would appeal the ruling , but the consensus reaction of academics and tech pundits came down in support of the decision .\nChin 's explanation of his ruling certainly did n't leave much wiggle room .\n`` [ Fair use ] doctrine permits the fair use of copyrighted works 'to fulfill copyright 's very purpose , `` [ t ] o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts , '' ' '' wrote Chin .\nIn my view , Google Books provides significant public benefits . It advances the progress of the arts and sciences , while maintaining respectful consideration for the rights of authors and other creative individuals , and without adversely impacting the rights of copyright holders . It has become an invaluable research tool that permits students , teachers , librarians , and others to more efficiently identify and locate books . It has given scholars the ability , for the first time , to conduct full-text searches of tens of millions of books . It preserves books , in particular out-of-print and old books that have been forgotten in the bowels of libraries , and it gives them new life . It facilitates access to books for print-disabled and remote or underserved populations . It generates new audiences and creates new sources of income for authors and publishers . Indeed , all society benefits .\nJudge Chin provided no data to support his assertion that Google Books surely results in additional book sales , but that 's just a quibble . The decision is clearly a big win for Google -- another successful step forward in the search giant 's quest to `` organize the world 's information . ''\nViewed in isolation , there is probably little reason to be alarmed about Google 's crushing victory over the Authors Guild . But viewed in the context of other recent news developments relating to Google , there is definitely cause for some concern .

Last week , it was the freedom-loving YouTube masses . Next week ? Advertisers ?\nCan Google be stopped ? If the Google Books decision is an omen , probably not . But should it be stopped ? That 's the question !\nIn mid-September , USA Today reported that Google was cooking up a plan to replace cookies as the primary way advertisers track people across the Web .
