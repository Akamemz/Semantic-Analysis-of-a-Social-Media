The media called it a \"revolution,\" and the late Peter Jennings from ABC likened Americans to 2-year-olds throwing a tantrum.\n\nEven that year, the reelection rate was 90 percent.\n\nMatt Kibbe of the group FreedomWorks and Hadley Heath Manning of Independent Women's Forum came on my show to say they don't believe that this will be the year voters \"throw the bums out.\"\n\nIncumbents have all sorts of built-in advantages, said Manning: \"Once you're in office, you have network ties, usually with a big party organization, usually with other officeholders.
