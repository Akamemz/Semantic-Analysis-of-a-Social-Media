I think the most I \u2019 ve written is that I think it probably won \u2019 t pan out and if it does , it \u2019 ll be Paul Manafort or Roger Stone or some other expendable type who \u2019 ll end up getting to know the underside of a bus . And that \u2019 s about it .\nI get asked why I don \u2019 t write about it more all the time .\nOne reason is I \u2019 m not a legal beagle like our own inestimable Andy McCarthy . I don \u2019 t write about how criminal investigations work , nor am I particularly well-versed on the finer details of special-counsel laws .\nAnother reason is I \u2019 ve found the whole feeding frenzy unappealing . The Democrats are clearly in full partisan mode , framing every inconvenient , benign , or even potentially exculpatory detail as a smoking gun . The whole \u201c hacked the election \u201d formulation , used both by the Democrats and by allegedly objective reporters , is a misleading bit of hyperbole .

I think it \u2019 s the \u201c Alt-Left , Globalist Mainstream , Deep State , Destroy Trump , Get a Two-Liter Bottle of Pepsi When You Order a MAGA Pizza Media \u201d now . More seriously , the rush to say there \u2019 s nothing to the collusion story is a mirror of the rush to insist the story is everything .

If he found no truly damning evidence of collusion , that wouldn \u2019 t surprise me at all . Nor would I be shocked if he found evidence of collusion . Sure , if he unearthed a videotape of Trump and Putin plotting their strategy over shvitz , I \u2019 d find that shocking .
