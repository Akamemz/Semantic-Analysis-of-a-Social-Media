She also backed Obama \u2019 s proposal to offer students two free years of community college .\nClinton promised Tuesday that she will have \u201c more to come . \u201d\n\u201c I will be rolling out very specific policies over the weeks and months ahead that I think are going to be at the core of not only a successful campaign but , much more importantly , getting our government to work again , \u201d she told reporters .\nBut mainly , Clinton hasn \u2019 t offered many clues about how her presidency would do more than serve as essentially Obama \u2019 s third term : How would she try to fix flaws in Obama \u2019 s signature health care law ? Would she crack down on Wall Street or the National Security Agency ? Would she break with Obama in pushing for fast-track trade deals ?\nAnswers to those and other questions can probably wait , some in both parties say . \u201c There will be plenty of time for policy and serious discussion , \u201d veteran New York-based Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf said . \u201c This is the entertainment part of the event . It \u2019 s a long time between now and November 2016 . \u201d\nSen. John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) , a former presidential nominee himself , said Clinton \u2019 s take-it-slow approach is smart \u201c if she can get away it . \u201d\nBut sooner or later , people are going to want answers . For the Democratic Party \u2019 s liberal Elizabeth Warren wing , a major question for Clinton will be how zealously her administration would police Wall Street , whether banks remain \u201c too big to fail \u201d and whether the lack of prosecutions following the 2008 financial collapse is a black mark on Obama \u2019 s Justice Department . Greens are also pushing Clinton to take a stand on the biggest environmental policy cliffhanger of Obama \u2019 s presidency : whether to allow construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada , a project that five years ago she said her State Department was \u201c inclined \u201d to support .\nShe \u2019 s been more outspoken in defending the Dodd-Frank financial regulation law , which Obama signed , and in backing the president \u2019 s net neutrality efforts . But her campaign website still had no policy section as of late Tuesday .\nThe spaces can \u2019 t stay blank forever , even her supporters acknowledge .\n\u201c Every presidential campaign by definition is about the future , \u201d said veteran Democratic strategist Chris Lehane , a top political adviser to liberal billionaire activist Tom Steyer , a central figure for liberal donors seeking to make climate change a premier campaign issue in 2016 . \u201c Assuming the Republicans nominate someone who is credible \u2026 neither of the candidates is going to be able to run a status quo type of a campaign . \u201d\nBut on the opening day of her campaign , her most prominent policy statement was a tweet from her campaign chairman , former Obama White House adviser John Podesta , who wrote that the \u201c top of the agenda \u201d would be \u201c helping working families succeed , building small businesses , tackling climate change & clean energy . \u201d\nThose mesh with the themes of economic populism and helping the middle class that Clinton has made clear would be at the heart of her campaign . But they \u2019 re not the main issues that have been crucial to her public image during her decades of political life , which have encompassed education reform in Arkansas , her attempt at a national health care overhaul in the early 1990s , her foreign policy focus as secretary of state , her several books and her longtime role as a champion of women \u2019 s rights .\nThen again , Clinton may not feel much pressure to fill in her platform quickly . Not only does she have an extensive track record and tremendous name recognition , but she \u2019 s standing alone in the Democratic field \u2014 at least until someone like former Maryland Gov . Martin O \u2019 Malley or former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb jumps in . In contrast , the dozens of potential and declared Republican contenders need to fight from Day One to stand out from their rivals with segments of their party .\nTad Devine , a longtime consultant to Democratic presidential candidates , agreed .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think there \u2019 s any need for her to lay out an entire platform for the future of government in the first 48 hours , \u201d said Devine , who had just spent the weekend in Vermont with another potential White House contender , independent Sen.
