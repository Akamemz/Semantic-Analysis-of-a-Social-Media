    "content": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) said Senate Democrats are kowtowing to \u201c left-wing lobbyists . Lynch nomination up in the air as Dems block anti-trafficking bill\nSenate Republicans are in no hurry to confirm Loretta Lynch as attorney general , meaning a final vote on her nomination could slip into April as a floor fight over abortion continues to drag on and a battle over the budget waits in the wings .\nLynch still has enough Republican support to be confirmed , but before senators even get to a final vote , they have to resolve the abortion impasse \u2014 a feat that seems elusive at the moment .\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell dug in on Tuesday , demanding the chamber finish work on an anti-human trafficking measure before considering Lynch . The Kentucky Republican said the Senate would hold repeated votes on the bill in the coming days .\nThat leaves the Senate in a bind because Democrats have promised to filibuster the trafficking bill unless an abortion-related provision is stripped out . On Tuesday , 43 Democrats voted to block the measure on a procedural vote \u2014 denying Republicans the 60 votes needed to advance the legislation for final passage .\n\u201c We \u2019 re going to stay on the bill , \u201d McConnell told reporters . \u201c I \u2019 ve said all along I thought that the president \u2019 s nominee to be attorney general is entitled to be considered on the Senate floor . And she will be considered as soon as we finish this very important bill . \u201d\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid ( D-Nev. ) called McConnell \u2019 s plan to hold more votes \u201c another wasted week , \u201d adding that the trafficking measure \u201c can \u2019 t pass with the abortion language in the bill . \u201d\nBut Republicans showed no signs of relenting on the abortion provisions .\n\u201c I think there \u2019 s great virtue in trying to stop human trafficking . I kind of feel that that \u2019 s more important than some other issue , \u201d Sen. John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) said . \u201c Loretta Lynch will be fine . The young women who are being sexually trafficked now and mistreated are not going to be fine . It \u2019 s disgraceful what the Democrats are doing , and they should be ashamed . \u201d\nIf neither side relents , Lynch \u2019 s confirmation vote could slip until after the Senate \u2019 s two-week Easter recess , which starts at the end of March .\nWhile Lynch is still expected to be confirmed as the nation \u2019 s top law enforcement official , her margin is looking increasingly slim . Just this week , Tennessee Republican Sens . Bob Corker and Lamar Alexander said they would oppose her . Most Republicans plan to oppose her , largely over her support of President Barack Obama \u2019 s executive actions that could stop deportations and give work permits to more than 4 million undocumented immigrants .\n\u201c This is an opportunity , within the Senate rules , to express my disapproval of the president \u2019 s abuse of executive authority , \u201d Alexander said in a statement Tuesday . \u201c And it \u2019 s an opportunity I intend to take . \u201d\nSo far , just four GOP senators \u2014 Lindsey Graham of South Carolina , Orrin Hatch of Utah , Jeff Flake of Arizona and Susan Collins of Maine \u2014 are publicly supporting Lynch . That \u2019 s just enough votes to win a simple majority vote to confirm her , as long as Vice President Joe Biden is called in to break a tie .\nIn a move that could give political cover for any remaining fence-sitting Republicans , Graham released a letter from former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani that praised Lynch \u2019 s record as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York . The letter said the president deserves to have his pick of nominees , even if he disagrees with some of her views .\nOn Tuesday , Reid suggested there was some bipartisan movement to resolve the stalemate , although he didn \u2019 t offer much in the way of specifics .\n\u201c There \u2019 s work being done to take the abortion language out , \u201d Reid told reporters . \u201c And that impetus is coming from Republicans . \u201d\nWhile Reid has been able to muster enough votes to block the trafficking bill , four Democrats voted with Republicans on Tuesday to cut off debate and advance the bill .
