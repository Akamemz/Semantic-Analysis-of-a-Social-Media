An official estimate last year said nearly 28 percent of former detainees were suspected of returning to the battlefield .\nBut administration officials are hoping to use a Senate defense policy bill to advance their long-stalled goal of shipping detainees out of the Cuba-based prison camp and , eventually , shutting it down . They say the bill , coming up for debate within days , would allow them to move out prisoners who have long been cleared for transfer overseas but are still held , in part because of a complicated Pentagon certification process .\nThe bill would ease those restrictions and lift a ban on bringing suspected terrorist prisoners from Guantanamo to the United States for detention , trial or emergency medical treatment .\nThe White House effort faces dogged resistance , with opponents pointing out that some former detainees have joined terrorist efforts after being released from the remote U.S. naval prison in Cuba .\n`` Why would you want to reduce the standard ? '' asked Sen. Kelly Ayotte , R-NH , who along with Sen. Saxby Chambliss , R-Ga. , is working on amendments to preserve the current high bar for transfers .\nEven if the Senate passes the White House-backed legislation , the House earlier this year approved a measure that further restricts transfers , including an outright ban on sending detainees to Yemen .
