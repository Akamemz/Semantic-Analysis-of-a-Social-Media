    "content": "It dropped yesterday . Over a decade ago , Fox News host Tucker Carlson said something shocking\u2026on a shock jock \u2019 s radio show . Golly ! I \u2019 m downright flabbergasted\u2014not ! For those who don \u2019 t have Sirius XM , Carlson was on Bubba The Love Sponge \u2019 s show on Howard 100 . Yes , that \u2019 s Howard Stern \u2019 s channel . Now , to be honest , I never really listened to Bubba \u2019 s show . Sorry , I was a loyal Howard Stern listener throughout high school and college . I \u2019 m still a fan , though I haven \u2019 t listened to the show in years . My commute to work is not that bad and the cost was just not worth it . But if you didn \u2019 t know that you could be a little looser than usual on this program , I don \u2019 t know what to tell you . Apparently , Media Matters , a left-wing outlet , decided to comb through years of radio clips for some reason in order to execute a hit job against Tucker Carlson . The Left hates him . So , he has to go . He shreds liberal narratives daily on his show on Fox News . And because he has differing opinions\u2014he must be destroyed . This is progressivism in 2019 ( via WaPo ) :\nA day after releasing audio of Tucker Carlson making numerous misogynist remarks , Media Matters for America published a new video with clips of the Fox News host using racist and homophobic language to describe Iraqi people , African Americans , gay people and immigrants while speaking on a radio program between 2006 and 2011 , according to a report published Tuesday by the nonprofit . The self-described watchdog of \u201c conservative misinformation in the U.S. media \u201d published the audio from Carlson \u2019 s appearances on a Tampa-based radio program , the \u201c Bubba the Love Sponge Show , \u201d just 25 hours after releasing similar recordings in which he \u2019 s heard flippantly using sexist language to express his views on child rape , rape shield laws , underage marriage and other sensitive topics . The new audio highlights about a dozen instances of Carlson using racist language on the \u201c shock jock \u201d show , which he apparently called into for about an hour per week . In 2008 , Carlson lamented that \u201c everyone \u2019 s embarrassed to be a white man , \u201d before stating that white men deserve credit for \u201c creating civilization and stuff . \u201d\nTucker Carlson said `` white men '' deserve credit for `` creating civilization ''\nHe said the Congressional Black Caucus `` exists to blame the white man for everything ''\nIt 's all white nationalist rhetorichttps : //t.co/ralRdRxYMI \u2014 Judd Legum ( @ JuddLegum ) March 12 , 2019\nYou can listen to the Media Matters clip in the link above . I \u2019 m not going to embed that here . It \u2019 s a shock jock show , folks . You cater to that audience . And given that there is no context here , just a bunch of random audio bites that range from 10-15 seconds spliced together from shows months apart\u2014I \u2019 m banking that this was the case . Fox News has rightfully stood by Carlson in the wake of this campaign of destruction . You never cave to the left-wing mob . They don \u2019 t care if you \u2019 re sorry . They don \u2019 t care about you , your family , or your well-being . They want to destroy you . Period . You represent a threat to their authoritarian ethos in which all aspects of society are broken to the will of the state .\nTucker addressed this non-controversy on his show , where he noted that progressives are at the heart of our cultural centers . They \u2019 re not shocked by his words on Bubba \u2019 s show . In fact , they \u2019 ve used them in their productions that they \u2019 ve disseminated across various mediums for years . The exception is that Carlson is a conservative and when he says it , it \u2019 s dirty . It \u2019 s racist . It \u2019 s misogynistic . He has to go . Nope . If there \u2019 s anything worse than a pack of progressives looking for blood , it \u2019 s ones that are also immersed in hypocrisy . This isn \u2019 t news . This isn \u2019 t even a story because we all know the end game here : the destruction of Tucker Carlson . Why should any conservative chime in and support this character assassination campaign ? Why should any conservative even think about siding with the Left in this fight ? The Carlson hit job is a friendly reminder that we \u2019 re at war with liberal America . And in war , there are casualties . It gets nasty . But to think that abject surrender is the first and only option is insanity .\nSomeone went through 5 years of radio appearances to get the worst things Tucker Carlson said out of context for one reason . To destroy his career and end his show . It is not about outrage . It is about hunting to find something to take out an enemy . They do it all the time . \u2014 Carmine Sabia ( @ CarmineSabia ) March 11 , 2019\nRepublicans have yet to learn en masse that losing with dignity sucks . You \u2019 re still a loser . And you \u2019 ll lose everything if you let the Left run all over you . That \u2019 s what would happen if Tucker had caved and apologized . They would still put forward a full-court press , more clips would be released , and the campaign to kill his career would \u2019 ve continued . These people are scum and you \u2019 re not obligated to apologize to the cancers of America . I liked Tucker Carlson \u2019 s show . Now , I \u2019 m a die-hard fan .\nThis isn \u2019 t some righteous crusade to clean up media . Please\u2014this is about clipping the Fox News elite ; the folks who have been giving liberal America heart palpitations for years . It \u2019 s about striking a blow against what the Left sees as a bastion of free speech . Others think Fox News has become state television administered by the Trump White House . Why ? Well , because this network hasn \u2019 t become addicted to the Muller investigation and Russian collusion nonsense . The faux outrage is also disgusting ( via Mediaite ) :\nFox News Channel \u2019 s Tucker Carlson has been under fire all day for comments he made on the radio over the years that were unearthed recently by Media Matters . CNN Newsroom was no exception , as anchor Brooke Baldwin , senior political analyst John Avlon , and commentator Ana Navarro tore into him , along with his colleague Jeanine Pirro , on Monday \u2019 s show . Baldwin began by playing the recordings with transcript on screen . When they cut back to her , she placed her head in her hands in dismay and offered a \u201c recap \u201d . \u201c Okay . Just to recap : The host of Fox \u2019 s most coveted time slot insulted women , even called a Supreme Court Justice unattractive , he also suggested underage marriage is not as serious as forcible child rape , calling rape shield laws totally unfair , \u201d said Baldwin . \u201c But like Pirro , he didn \u2019 t apologize . He called his words quote , naughty , and instead pushed viewers to tune in tonight. \u201d Baldwin turned to Avlon and said : \u201c No apologies for the vile rhetoric . Instead the message is tune in . Is that their business model ? \u201d Avlon said \u201c no , \u201d then added , \u201c I think what they \u2019 re seeing though is a contagion from the shock and awe business model they \u2019 ve done , where it \u2019 s play to the base , inflame with anxiety , anger , fear at the other\u2013and it gets them into trouble , because guess what , you \u2019 re playing with fire when you play with those forces . \u201d\nOh , enough guys .
