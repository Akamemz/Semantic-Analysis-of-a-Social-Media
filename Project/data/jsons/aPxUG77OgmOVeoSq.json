But by appearing halfway normal , as he did at last Saturday \u2019 s debate in South Carolina , and not engaging in theatrics about carpetbombing , waterboarding , or ripping up treaties , he has become the default choice of those who would worry if Kasich \u2019 s opponents ever got their hands on the nuclear switch .\nHe has the advantage ( and disadvantage ) of a long record .

He has not changed ideologically or temperamentally\u2014his 2011 effort to roll back labor protection for state employees was too extreme and Ohio voters overwhelmingly defeated it\u2014but while Kasich has remained a staunch conservative , much of his party has lurched so far right it has entered Bizarro World .\nThis fact accounts for Kasich \u2019 s reputation as a RINO ( Republican in name only ) and why it may be more difficult for him to win his own party \u2019 s nomination than the general election . His apostasy in having Ohio accept Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act is unforgivable to Republicans who consider health insurance for the poor to be an instrument of Satan . Likewise , in 1994 he voted for an assault weapons ban , pure heresy for the burgeoning Ted Nugent wing of his party . Kasich \u2019 s practice of occasionally dissing wealthy GOP donors who are accustomed to blind deference is considered a minus among the party \u2019 s bigwigs .\nThose deeds might help , though , in a general election .
