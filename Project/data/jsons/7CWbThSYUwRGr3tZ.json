    "content": "( CNN ) -- Was it a debate ? A berating ? A surreal televised `` stunt '' ? No matter what you call radio host Alex Jones ' appearance on `` Piers Morgan Tonight , '' one thing is certain : It 's generating a great deal of social media buzz .\nOn Tuesday morning , Jones was a top-trending topic on Twitter as people read about the interview , watched clips online or shared their thoughts after watching Monday night 's fiery exchange live .\nThe man behind a petition to deport Morgan back to the UK for expressing his views on gun control went on the attack , calling the CNN host `` a hatchet man of the new world order . ''\n`` 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms ! '' Jones yelled . `` It does n't matter how many lemmings ( mindless followers ) you get out on the street begging for them to have their guns taken ! We will not relinquish them ! Do you understand ? ''\nMorgan has pushed for stricter gun control regulations since a gunman killed 27 people before committing suicide last month in Newtown , Connecticut -- 26 of them in a mass shooting at an elementary school , including 20 children .\n`` I 'm in favor of a nationwide ban on military-style semiautomatic assault weapons and high-capacity magazines , '' he said as he opened his Monday night show , before introducing Jones .\nAlex Jones : `` The Republic will rise again when you attempt to take our guns ''\nJones ' petition , posted on the White House website , accuses Morgan of being `` engaged in a hostile attack against the U.S. Constitution by targeting the Second Amendment . '' It has more than 100,000 signatures .\nMorgan prefaced his confrontation with Jones with a live report on Monday 's testimony in a preliminary hearing for Aurora movie theater shooting suspect James Holmes and a live interview with relatives of two victims who died in a hail of bullets from a military-style rifle in that shooting in July .\n`` I appreciate you having your First Amendment right . I am glad you are speaking out , '' said Dave Hoover , whose nephew died in the movie theater .\nThe White House also made reference to First Amendment freedoms , in a statement Monday night .\n`` The White House responds to all petitions that cross the threshold , and we will respond to this one , '' spokesman Jay Carney said , referring to petitions on whitehouse.gov that get at least 25,000 signatures . `` In the meantime , it 's worth remembering that freedom of expression is a bedrock principle in our democracy . ''\nRead more : Piers Morgan and guests react to various gun incidents\nJones thanked Morgan for having him on the show , and then said he and others started the petition to point out that `` we have all of these foreigners '' and globalist forces , including `` megabanks that control the planet , '' trying to take away American guns .\n`` When they get our guns , they can have their world tyranny , '' he said .\nMorgan 's attempt to interject questions ran up against Jones ' heated chatter , leading up to a crescendo with Jones reciting a list of despotic world leaders who he said took away guns : Hitler , Stalin , Mao , Castro , Chavez .\nAfter 2\u00bd minutes , Jones rounded off his monologue with a friendly offer to take Morgan out shooting , so he could `` become an American '' and `` join the Republic . ''\nHe also offered to climb into a boxing ring with Morgan . At the end of the interview , he imitated the Briton 's English accent , before declaring him a `` Redcoat '' who should go back to where he came from .\nJones said : `` Yes . '' Then he began a tirade against makers of antidepressant drugs .\nJones said he owns about 50 weapons . His radio show can be heard on 140 radio shows around the country , he said .\nMorgan says Jones ' rant backfired , making Morgan 's point for him .\n`` I ca n't think of a better advertisement for gun control than Alex Jones ' interview last night , '' he said Tuesday on CNN 's `` Newsroom . '' `` It was startling , it was terrifying in parts . It was completely deluded . It was based on a premise of making Americans so fearful that they all rush out to buy even more guns . ''\n`` I think silence was the best weapon against him because he just dug himself an ever bigger hole , '' Morgan said , adding that Jones `` spouts dangerous nonsense . ''\nJones , on his website infowars.com , had an image of Morgan dressed as a `` Redcoat '' next to Jones himself dressed as a `` patriot . ''\nA summary of his plan for Tuesday 's radio show said he would discuss `` his effort to defend the Constitution and the Second Amendment from attack by the establishment media as the government prepares its latest gun-grabbing assault on law-abiding Americans . '' The description adds that through the interview , `` we have put the globalists on notice . ''\nOn the program , he said that 95 % of people he has heard from `` think that I just told it like it was '' and `` slammed them hard , '' delivering an important message .\n`` I have been overworked , '' Jones added , describing a busy schedule . `` But I did the best job I could and I 'm proud of the job I did overall . ''\nResponding to Morgan 's depiction of how the interview went , Jones asked whether that was because he is `` a hillbilly that wo n't be your slave and knows history . ''\nHe described Morgan as being like `` a mannequin , a vampire . ''\nThough many found fault with Jones ' performance , some found common ground with his arguments .\n`` The tact with which Jones presented himself with was inexcusable .

'' PhilipCabibi wrote in the comments section of this article .\n`` I see where Jones was trying to go , but unfortunately , he presented his facts in such a manner that it will turn most off to them . Which is unfortunate ... because no matter how rude someone is , it does n't change facts and it does n't change history .

''\nFacebook user Steve Spark made similar comments in a CNN discussion . `` If you have a nutjob as a guest , you ca n't be surprised when they act like a nutjob , '' he wrote , adding , `` Some might say it makes for good TV , but I think it 's just embarrassing . ''\nThe Huffington Post summarized the program this way : `` Piers Morgan 's pro-gun guest goes absolutely nuts at him .
