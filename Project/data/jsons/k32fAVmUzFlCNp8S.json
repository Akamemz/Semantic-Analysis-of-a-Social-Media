She \u2019 s regarded as the best-sourced reporter in Washington , the irony being that she only spends part of her time there , working largely out of her home turf in New York . She \u2019 s able not only to get inside the room with Trump , but to seemingly get inside his brain\u2014to translate for the masses what he and the people around him at any given moment are thinking about the crisis or controversy du jour . That skill has made her incredibly valuable at a time when juicy , granular , inside-the-room dish has gained massive journalistic currency\u2014Trump watching cable news in his bathrobe , Trump in a foul mood for this reason or that , and so on .\n\u201c The larger story , \u201d one of Haberman \u2019 s colleagues told me , \u201c is the increasingly tabloid-y evolution of the mainstream political press . These stories are fun to read , they \u2019 re very of-the-moment , they \u2019 re made for Twitter .
