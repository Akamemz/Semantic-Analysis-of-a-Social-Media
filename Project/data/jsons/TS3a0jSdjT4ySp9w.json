Obama \u2019 s decision to change that policy was not based on American interests or in the interests of peace . It was done out of personal revenge against Prime Minister Netanyahu and an act of pique by the outgoing president .\nIt was also designed improperly to tie the hands of President-elect Trump . President Trump is doing the right thing by telling the United Nations that the United States now rejects the one-sided U.N. Security Council Resolution .\nSo if there is any change to the status quo , let the blame lie where it should be : at the hands of President Obama for his cowardly decision to wait until he was a lame-duck president to get even with Prime Minister Netanyahu . President Trump deserves praise for restoring balance in negotiations with Israel and the Palestinians . It was President Obama who made peace more difficult . It was President Trump who made it more feasible again .\nThe outrageously one-sided Security Council Resolution declared that \u201c any changes to the 4 June 1967 lines , including with regard to Jerusalem , \u201d have \u201c no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law. \u201d This means , among other things , that Israel \u2019 s decision to build a plaza for prayer at the Western Wall \u2014 Judaism \u2019 s holiest site \u2014 constitutes a \u201c flagrant violation of international law. \u201d This resolution was , therefore , not limited to settlements in the West Bank , as the Obama administration later claimed in a bait-and-switch . The resolution applied equally to the very heart of Israel .\nBefore June 4 , 1967 , Jews were forbidden from praying at the Western Wall , Judaism \u2019 s holiest site . They were forbidden to attend classes at the Hebrew University at Mt . Scopus , which had been opened in 1925 and was supported by Albert Einstein . Jews could not seek medical care at the Hadassah Hospital on Mt . Scopus , which had treated Jews and Arabs alike since 1918 . Jews could not live in the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem , where their forbearers had built homes and synagogues for thousands of years . These Judenrein prohibitions were enacted by Jordan , which had captured by military force these Jewish areas during Israel \u2019 s War of Independence , in 1948 , and had illegally occupied the entire West Bank , which the United Nations had set aside for an Arab state . When the Jordanian government occupied these historic Jewish sites , they destroyed all the remnants of Judaism , including synagogues , schools and cemeteries , whose headstones they used for urinals . Between 1948 and 1967 , the United Nations did not offer a single resolution condemning this Jordanian occupation and cultural devastation .\nWhen Israel retook these areas in a defensive war that Jordan started by shelling civilian homes in West Jerusalem , and opened them up as places where Jews could pray , study , receive medical treatment and live , the United States took the official position that it would not recognize Israel \u2019 s legitimate claims to Jewish Jerusalem .\nIt stated that the status of Jerusalem , including these newly liberated areas , would be left open to final negotiations and that the status quo would remain in place . That is the official rationale for why the United States refused to recognize any part of Jerusalem , including West Jerusalem , as part of Israel . That is why the United States refused to allow an American citizen born in any part of Jerusalem to put the words \u201c Jerusalem , Israel \u201d on his or her passport as their place of birth .\nBut even that historic status quo was changed with President Obama \u2019 s unjustified decision not to veto the Security Council Resolution from last December . The United Nations all of a sudden determined that , subject to any further negotiations and agreements , the Jewish areas of Jerusalem recaptured from Jordan in 1967 are not part of Israel . Instead , they were territories being illegally occupied by Israel , and any building in these areas \u2014 including places for prayer at the Western Wall , access roads to Mt . Scopus , and synagogues in the historic Jewish Quarter \u2014 \u201c constitutes a flagrant violation under international law. \u201d If that indeed is the new status quo , then what incentives do the Palestinians have to enter negotiations ? And if they were to do so , they could use these Jewish areas to extort unreasonable concessions from Israel , for which these now \u201c illegally occupied \u201d areas are sacred and nonnegotiable .\nPresident Obama \u2019 s refusal to veto this one-sided resolution was a deliberate ploy to tie the hands of his successors , the consequence of which was to make it far more difficult for his successors to encourage the Palestinians to accept Israel \u2019 s offer to negotiate with no preconditions . No future president can undo this pernicious agreement , since a veto not cast can never be retroactively cast . And a resolution once enacted can not be rescinded unless there is a majority vote against it , with no veto by any of its permanent members , which include Russia and China , who would be sure to veto any attempt to undo this resolution .\nPresident Trump \u2019 s decision to officially recognize Jerusalem as Israel \u2019 s capital helps to restore the appropriate balance . It demonstrates that the United States does not accept the Judenrein effects of this bigoted resolution on historic Jewish areas of Jerusalem , which were forbidden to Jews . The prior refusal of the United States to recognize Jerusalem as Israel \u2019 s capital was based explicitly on the notion that nothing should be done to change the status quo of that city , holy to three religions . But the Security Council Resolution did exactly that : It changed the status quo by declaring Israel \u2019 s de facto presence on these Jewish holy sites to be a \u201c flagrant violation under international law \u201d that \u201c the U.N. will not recognize . \u201d\nSince virtually everyone in the international community acknowledges that any reasonable peace would recognize Israel \u2019 s legitimate claims to these and other areas in Jerusalem , there is no reason for allowing the U.N . Resolution to make criminals out of every Jew or Israeli who sets foot on these historically Jewish areas . ( Ironically , President Obama prayed at what he regarded as the illegally occupied Western Wall . )\nAfter the UN , at the urging of President Obama , made it a continuing international crime for there to be any Israeli presence in disputed areas of Jerusalem , including areas whose Jewish provenance is beyond dispute , President Trump was right to untie his own hands and to undo the damage wrought by his predecessor . Some have argued that the United States should not recognize Jerusalem because it will stimulate violence by Arab terrorists . No American decision should ever be influenced by the threat of violence . Terrorists should not have a veto over American policy . If the United States were to give in to threat of violence , it would only incentivize others to threaten violence in response to any peace plan .\nSo let \u2019 s praise President Trump for doing the right thing by undoing the wrong thing President Obama did at the end of his presidency .",
