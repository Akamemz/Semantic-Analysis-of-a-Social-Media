With Shogan out of the race , Rep. Gardner leads 52 - 42 percent , the independent Quinnipiac University poll finds . This survey of likely voters can not be compared with earlier surveys of registered voters . In the three-way matchup , Gardner leads Udall among men 53 - 34 percent , with 9 percent for Shogan .

Two new public polls indicate that their costly efforts have n't gotten the job done . Yesterday we told you about a new Suffolk/USA Today survey showing Gardner pulling into a very slim lead over incumbent Democrat Mark Udall ( 43/42 ) . We also highlighted a Quinnipiac poll that put Republican gubernatorial nominee Bob Beauprez ten points ahead of incumbent Democrat John Hickenlooper . Quinnipiac had n't released its Senate numbers yesterday , but I speculated that they 'd almost certainly show Gardner in the lead : Lo and behold , those results have now dropped A separate question asks Shogan voters , who are far more likely to say that they may change their vote before election day , whom they 'd pick as their second choice in the race . That result : 52-42 for Gardner . Other polling has shown Gardner trailing among independents ( a rarity for a Republican this cycle ) , and losing women pretty badly . This survey suggests he 's closing those gaps . He 's now ( +10 ) on personal favorability -- extraordinary , given the relentless character assassination ads -- while Udall is ( -8 ) on the same measure . Sure enough , Udall 's individual character ratings are ugly : He 's underwater on `` honest and trustworthy '' and `` cares about people like you , '' while Gardner is soaring on both fronts . Of those respondents who say their vote will reflect their feelings on President Obama , they break against the president by nearly a three-to-one margin . Polls have consistently shown Obama 's overall approval rating upside-down in the Rocky Mountain State for months , with Obamacare acting as another major drag . The Udall campaign has rushed out internal polling to reassure nervous supporters : National Journal 's Josh Kraushaar notes that even Udall 's own figures show him several points shy of 50 . He also points out that the Q-poll 's sample was pretty heavily Republican , which explains the big leads for Gardner and Beauprez . Both margins look like outliers , at least for now . But there 's a common denominatior between Q 's data and the less-outlierish USA Today poll : Udall is polling in the low 40 's -- a big time danger zone for an incumbent . I 'm skeptical that Gardner is actually up by eight in this race , but the red flags for Udall and the GOP 's momentum look to be real . Stuck in a dead heat or trailing , Udall is taking the unprecedented step of avoiding televised debates in Colorado , perhaps because his first un-televised meeting with Gardner did n't go well for him . At all . Instead , he 's going to continue bombarding the airwaves with attack ads as his primary means of interacting with voters . Denver 's local CBS affiliate fact-checked one demagogic spot he 's running against Gardner , declaring it misleading and `` politics at its worst : '' It 's a bit weird seeing excellent , fair , down-the-middle reporting , is n't it ?
