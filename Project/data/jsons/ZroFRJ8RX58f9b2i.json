But for a man who \u2019 s long had his eye on higher office , it \u2019 s fair to say those presidential hopes are now doomed .\nA 30-point margin of victory ( as of press time ) in a primary would be extremely impressive for a professional politician running in a contested open primary against another political pro .\nBut that \u2019 s not what was happening here . Cuomo is a two-term incumbent governor who served four years as attorney general before that , served in Bill Clinton \u2019 s Cabinet , and is the son of a man who served 20 years in statewide office from the mid-1970s to the mid- \u2019 90s .\nCuomo \u2019 s opponent was best known as the co-star of ( an admittedly wonderful ) television show that \u2019 s been off the air for nearly 15 years . Befitting such a mismatched pairing , Cuomo also crushed Nixon in fundraising , outspending her about 20-1 , and called in an unusual endorsement from the Democratic National Committee along with the support of the entire state party apparatus .\nNixon had on her side , by contrast , the reality that a lot of people really hate Andrew Cuomo . And she challenged him in a year when insurgent progressives , particularly women , have performed particularly well in House primaries . But that wasn \u2019 t nearly enough for her to beat him . The fact that Cuomo had to fight at all shows pretty clearly how hopeless he \u2019 d be in a national primary , where he \u2019 d lack any of his advantages .\nThe demographic key to Cuomo \u2019 s victory is a pattern we \u2019 ve seen before when left-wing insurgents fall short : He received overwhelming support among African-American and Latino voters . These same groups also rejected Zephyr Teachout \u2019 s campaign for attorney general , backed Hillary Clinton in 2016 , and , generally speaking , do not seem impressed by white outsider/reformer candidates of any kind .\nIndeed , their stated views on economic policy issues are quite progressive . The difference is that while many white progressives have an antagonistic relationship with the Democratic Party as an institution , African-American and Latino Democrats are much more likely to think of themselves as party regulars . For example , Bernie Sanders had a 70 percent approval rating among African Americans as of a few months ago , even though he didn \u2019 t garner anywhere near that support with black voters in 2016 .\nIn other words , Cuomo \u2019 s success with voters of color isn \u2019 t particularly a sign of extraordinary infatuation with him personally or his brand of politics . Rather , he benefits from his standing as the establishment candidate \u2014 the one who is known , the one who is proven , and the one who has all the endorsements .\nNone of this would carry over to a presidential race in which Cuomo would be squaring off against a range of other professional politicians \u2014 including at least one or two nonwhite ones \u2014 with their own set of endorsements .\nSomething that high-information political junkies , unlike most voters , understand is that endorsements are a fairly unreliable metric of actual political sentiments .\nLabor unions endorsed Cuomo because he was a governor who has delivered for them on concrete priorities , even if he is actually less progressive than they would ideally prefer . National organizations like Emily \u2019 s List that would back a woman who supports abortion rights in an open race didn \u2019 t back insurgent Nixon against an incumbent . Nearly every major reliable interest group lined up behind Cuomo , and elected officials likewise fell in line . Even someone like New York Mayor Bill de Blasio , who \u2019 s been at open war with Cuomo on a number of fronts , didn \u2019 t endorse Nixon .\nThis kind of top-down machine operates as a flywheel \u2014 more people endorsing the incumbent causes other people to endorse him .
