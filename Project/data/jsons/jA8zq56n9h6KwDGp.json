    "content": "HANOI , Vietnam \u2014 President Trump \u2019 s high-stakes summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ended abruptly without a deal Thursday , cutting short two days of talks aimed at dismantling Pyongyang \u2019 s weapons program and leaving the two sides with a murky and uncertain path ahead .\nIn the stunning outcome in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi , the two sides disagreed over what led to the breakdown and whether and when new talks can be arranged . Mr. Trump said he expected his extraordinary personal diplomacy with Mr. Kim to end the crisis on the divided Korean Peninsula will continue .\nTo the surprise of supporters and detractors back home , Mr. Trump proved willing to walk away from a diplomatic breakthrough that he clearly craved . He said he ended the private talks two hours early when Mr. Kim insisted that all international economic sanctions be dropped before the North agrees to shutter its nuclear and missile programs .\n\u201c Sometimes you have to walk , \u201d Mr. Trump explained at a subdued closing news conference . Mr. Trump said he rejected a more modest agreement that was \u201c ready to be signed , \u201d and a signing ceremony and celebratory lunch that were on the two leaders \u2019 schedules were quickly scrubbed .\n\u201c I \u2019 d much rather do it right than do it fast \u2026 , \u201d Mr. Trump said . \u201c Basically , they wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety , and we couldn \u2019 t do that . \u201d\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters as he flew to the Philippines from Vietnam on Thursday , \u201c We were hoping we could take another big swing when the two leaders got together .\nSEE ALSO : Trump says at least Cohen didn \u2019 t lie about Russian collusion : \u2018 It was pretty shameful \u2019\n\u201c We made some progress , but we didn \u2019 t get as far as we would have hoped we would have gotten , \u201d Mr. Pompeo said .\nBut in a sign of possible trouble ahead , North Korea \u2019 s top diplomat held a rare press briefing of his own to challenge Mr. Trump \u2019 s version of events . He said Mr. Kim had not made the maximalist demands that Mr. Trump described .\nEven as the U.S. delegation was jetting home on Air Force One , North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho insisted that Pyongyang had asked only for a partial easing of the sanctions in exchange for shutting down the North \u2019 s main nuclear complex in Yongbyon . Mr. Ri said the North was also ready to offer in writing a permanent halt of the country \u2019 s nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests and that Washington had wasted an opportunity that \u201c may not come again . \u201d\nMr. Pompeo predicted that lower-level diplomacy between the two sides could resume quickly , but Pyongyang challenged even that . North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui told reporters that Mr. Kim was finding it difficult to understand why the U.S. left the talks and that the young North Korean leader \u201c may have lost his will \u201d to continue the talks .\nMr. Trump said the end of the talks was amicable . He even offered a sort of defense of Mr. Kim over the death of U.S. college student Otto Warmbier , who succumbed to severe illness shortly after his release from a North Korean prison in June 2017 .\nMr. Trump once cited Warmbier \u2019 s treatment as a symbol of the human rights failings of the Kim regime , but he said Thursday that the North Korean leader told him he had not been aware of the Ohio college student \u2019 s case .\nMr. Kim \u201c tells me that he didn \u2019 t know about it , and I will take him at his word , \u201d Mr. Trump said .\nThose comments struck a discordant note in the generally positive assessment in Washington of Mr. Trump \u2019 s handling of the summit .\n\u201c We must remember Otto , and we should never let North Korea off the hook for what they did to him , \u201d Sen . Rob Portman , Ohio Republican , said in a statement .\nBut ending the summit without agreement on any of the issues discussed clearly fell short of expectations . Negotiators on both sides had spent months in talks leading up to the summit , trying to pave the way for an agreement that also could have included a declaration to formally end the Korean War or the opening of a U.S. liaison office in Pyongyang .\nThe stunning result divided analysts who said Mr. Trump had already taken a huge gamble in agreeing to meet with the reclusive North Korean leader and holding a one-on-negotiating session with so many key items still unresolved .\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer , a New York Democrat who is usually a fierce critic of the president , said Mr. Trump \u201c did the right thing by walking away and not cutting a poor deal for the sake of a photo op . \u201d\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi , California Democrat , also said Mr. Trump was right not to take a bad deal , but she argued that Mr. Kim was the \u201c big winner \u201d for having secured two personal summits with an American president and easing his country \u2019 s pariah status without having made any significant concessions .\nSome said Mr. Trump may have enhanced his bargaining position by showing the North Koreans and a watching world that he was willing to risk short-term setbacks to achieve his long-term goals .
