    "content": "As Trump won primary after primary in 2016 , a rattled John Brennan started claiming to colleagues at the CIA that Estonia \u2019 s intelligence agency had alerted him to an intercepted phone call suggesting Putin was pouring money into the Trump campaign . The tip was bogus , but Brennan bit on it with opportunistic relish .\nOut of Brennan \u2019 s alarmist chatter about the bogus tip came an extraordinary leak to the BBC : that Brennan had used it , along with later half-baked tips from British intelligence , as the justification to form a multi-agency spy operation ( given the Orwellian designation of an \u201c inter-agency taskforce \u201d ) on the Trump campaign , which he was running right out of CIA headquarters .\nThe CIA was furious about the leak , but never denied the BBC \u2019 s story . To Congress earlier this year , Brennan acknowledged the existence of the group , but cast his role in it as the mere conduit of tips about Trump-Russia collusion : \u201c It was well beyond my mandate as director of CIA to follow on any of those leads that involved U.S. persons . But I made sure that anything that was involving U.S. persons , including anything involving the individuals involved in the Trump campaign , was shared with the bureau . \u201d\nBut if his role had truly been passive , the \u201c inter-agency taskforce \u201d wouldn \u2019 t have been meeting at CIA headquarters . By keeping its discussions at Langley , Brennan could keep his finger wedged in the pie . Both before and after the FBI \u2019 s official probe began in late July 2016 , Brennan was bringing together into the same room at CIA headquarters a cast of Trump haters across the Obama administration whose activities he could direct \u2014 from Peter Strzok , the FBI liaison to Brennan , to the doltish Jim Clapper , Brennan \u2019 s errand boy , to an assortment of Brennan \u2019 s buddies at the Treasury Department , Justice Department , and White House .\nThe bogus tip from Estonia led the group into its first cock-up : sending FBI agents to sniff around the computer server connected to Trump Tower . After that effort flopped , Brennan \u2019 s group had to go back to the drawing board ( on the electronic intelligence front , it had already hatched plans for national security letters and FISA warrants ) . Someone in the group must have proposed blasting a swampy old CIA source and Hillary supporter , Stefan Halper , into the Trump campaign orbit to see if he could catch a couple of minor campaign volunteers out in collusion .\nHalper had entered the Deep State through a door opened by his father-in-law , Ray Cline , whose work for the CIA was legendary . Behind that door Halper found a treasure trove of jobs and government contracts , making his life as a transatlantic jet-setting academic possible . Brennan \u2019 s Langley group had access to Halper \u2019 s file and sized him up as the perfect embed : a Republican-oriented foreign policy scholar who could plausibly interact with Trump officials while serving as a nexus between the CIA and Brennan \u2019 s friends in British intelligence . Halper \u2019 s ties to Richard Dearlove , a former head of British intelligence , are well known , and Halper knows Alexander Downer , the pub-crawling Aussie diplomat , through a mutual association with Cambridge University .\nThat Halper came out of the brainstorming of Brennan \u2019 s group is clear from the fact that his first known meeting with Carter Page preceded the formal opening of the FBI \u2019 s probe . The Washington Post hinted at the role of Brennan \u2019 s group in hatching Halper :\nMany questions about the informant \u2019 s role in the Russia investigation remain unanswered . It is unclear how he first became involved in the case , the extent of the information he provided and the actions he took to obtain intelligence for the FBI . It is also unknown whether his July 2016 interaction with [ Carter ] Page was brokered by the FBI or another intelligence agency [ italics added ] . The FBI commonly uses sources and informants to gather evidence and its regulations allow for use of informants even before a formal investigation has been opened . In many law enforcement investigations , the use of sources and informants precedes more invasive techniques such as electronic surveillance .\nA veteran of the intelligence community tells TAS that Brennan \u2019 s CIA was full of Hillary supporters , some of whom decorated their desks with her campaign paraphernalia . Brennan , whom the press noted would walk the halls of the CIA in an LGBT rainbow lanyard , encouraged this open political atmosphere . While Brennan knew his spying operation on the Trump campaign was an \u201c exceptionally , exceptionally sensitive \u201d matter ( as reported by journalists David Corn and Michael Isikoff ) , he assumed its machinations would never come to light .\nThe members of Brennan \u2019 s working group at Langley \u201c were just a bunch of out-of-control idiots , \u201d says a former high-ranking CIA official to TAS . He finds it flabbergasting that Brennan would bring CIA officials and FBI officials into the same room to cook up schemes to send a spy into the Trump campaign \u2019 s ranks . One of those schemes involved money ( Halper paid George Papadopoulos $ 3,000 for a phony research paper as a way of luring him into a London meeting ) ; another involved sex ( Halper \u2019 s assistant , with a name out of a bad spy novel , Azra Turk , tried to coax information from Papadopoulos at flirty bar outings , according to the Daily Caller \u2019 s Chuck Ross ) .\nLike Brennan , Halper didn \u2019 t bother to hide his support for Hillary even as he conducted this infiltration .

That rationale must have figured into Alexander Downer \u2019 s motivation for working with Brennan \u2019 s Langley group too . Downer traveled in the same elitist circles as Christopher Steele , Halper , and John Kerry .
