    "content": "If the U.S. government shuts down Oct. 1 , it will be because of a chain of events set in motion by a 26-year-old and a video camera .\nYet David Daleiden , the young Californian who masterminded the Planned Parenthood sting , isn \u2019 t worried about whether the threat of a shutdown is the right way to go . He just wants the women \u2019 s health provider that he says traffics in `` baby body parts '' to be stripped of taxpayer support .\nThe activist who has almost single-handedly \u2014 and in critics \u2019 view , unscrupulously \u2014 reshaped the national conversation on abortion says that instead of focusing on the political fallout of his videos , he 's spending his time praying for the individuals he met during his 30-month probe of Planned Parenthood .\n\u201c I still consider Deb Nucatola a friend , \u201d Daleiden said of Planned Parenthood \u2019 s senior director of medical services , whom he secretly videotaped discussing fetal tissue donations while he posed as an executive of a biomedical research company .\n\u201c She was the one \u2014 of all of the Planned Parenthood representatives \u2014 that the investigators felt the most close to and frankly , that we \u2019 re actually the most concerned about , \u201d he said . \u201c Right before this project came out , I had a Mass said for her . \u201d\nIn a rare telephone interview Friday as the battle to defund Planned Parenthood ramps up , Daleiden revealed new details of how he set up his elaborate sting , which he considers a form of investigative journalism . For the first time , he signaled he is likely to comply with an expected invitation to testify before Congress , even though he is pleading the Fifth in a lawsuit brought by one of the organizations that he videotaped without their knowledge .\nThe 10 videos released so far by Daleiden and his group , the Center for Medical Progress , show Planned Parenthood officials discussing reimbursement for handling fetal tissue and organs , which are illegal to sell for a profit .\n\u201c For me , the goal was to document and illustrate for the public really , really clearly how Planned Parenthood harvests and sells the body parts of the babies that they abort , \u201d the Sacramento native said .\nPlanned Parenthood , as well as the tissue procurement companies that work with it , deny any illegal activity . The women \u2019 s health organization says that only a handful of its clinics procure fetal tissue and then only with a patient \u2019 s consent and with reimbursements only to recover costs . The group argues that Daleiden \u2019 s videos are selectively edited to be misleading and that he and his co-workers broke several laws to compile them .\n`` Let 's call this what it is : David Daleiden is lying , in order to push an extreme agenda to ban abortion completely in this country , \u201d said Eric Ferrero , vice president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America . \u201c Even his doctored , discredited videos have n't shown anyone at Planned Parenthood violating any laws . Some far-right politicians have latched onto these lies in order to score political points , but it turns out the American public is n't as easily fooled as Daleiden hoped . \u201d\nDaleiden has spent years steeped in the anti-abortion movement . He calls himself a \u201c good actor \u201d who faked his way into Planned Parenthood , funded by $ 120,000 from anonymous donors who believed in his cause to bring down the organization using sting videos .\nAs the move to defund the organization mounts , he wants Planned Parenthood held accountable and he said he has proved that the group should not be able to hold itself up as a \u201c legitimate mainstream , medical organization . \u201d\nThe tapes have created a political furor , with GOP presidential hopefuls as well as Republican lawmakers inveighing against the sale of \u201c baby body parts \u201d and several congressional committees and state attorneys general probing the practices of the women \u2019 s health provider . Two lawsuits have been filed against Daleiden for videotaping without the subjects \u2019 knowledge or consent and violating confidentiality agreements .\nThe Senate is also planning a vote this week \u2014 which is expected to be unsuccessful \u2014 on banning abortion at 20 weeks of pregnancy .\nThe clandestine videos have also led to a significant increase in threats of violence against abortion providers , according to the National Abortion Federation , an ally of Planned Parenthood .\n\u201c In my 20 years , I have not seen this type of escalation before , \u201d the group \u2019 s president , Vicki Saporta , said of death threats against abortion providers \u2014 and even a reward for the murder of one provider shown in the videos . \u201c It started right after the first video was released . \u201d\nSaporta said she has seen before how such things can lead to tragedy , pointing out that Center for Medical Progress board member Troy Newman also leads Operation Rescue , the anti-abortion group that moved to Wichita to stage demonstrations against George Tiller \u2019 s abortion clinic .
