For those who do n't speak health wonk , Obamacare 's risk adjustment provision is one of the three main mechanisms that the law uses to distribute risk amongst participating insurers , ensuring that no insurer fails under the weight of an unusually sick and expensive customer base . Basically , it requires insurers who end up with an especially healthy group of patients to pay into a system that makes payments out to insurers that end up with unusually sick patients . As a Kaiser Family Foundation report from last month explained , the goal `` is to encourage insurers to compete based on the value and efficiency of their plans rather than by attracting healthier enrollees . ''\nThe proposed new rules would factor in data about prescription drug usage , and would also attempt to account for beneficiaries who only enroll for part of the year . Essentially , the goal of the changes is to mitigate the high cost of very sick individuals who rely on expensive drugs and people who are gaming the system by paying for insurance only when they need it .\nThere are reasons to be concerned about the specifics of the rules , in particular the prescription drug changes , which some experts worry might result in doctors writing additional unnecessary prescriptions in order to get the coding right\u2014remember , in order for the formula 's payments to be made , all of this information has to be tracked\u2014which could further increase overall spending on health care .\nNarrow unintended consequences aside , the bigger picture here is that this is an acknowledgement by the federal government of the problems with the exchanges .
