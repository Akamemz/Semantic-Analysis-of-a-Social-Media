But recently , I did just that when I sat down with Lisa Page the week before Thanksgiving in my hotel room in Washington , D.C . Page , of course , is the former FBI lawyer whose text-message exchanges with agent Peter Strzok that belittled Donald Trump and expressed fear at his possible victory became international news . They were hijacked by Trump to fuel his \u201c deep state \u201d conspiracy .\nFor the nearly two years since her name first made the papers , she \u2019 s been publicly silent ( she did have a closed-door interview with House members in July 2018 ) . I asked her why she was willing to talk now . \u201c Honestly , his demeaning fake orgasm was really the straw that broke the camel \u2019 s back , \u201d she says . The president called out her name as he acted out an orgasm in front of thousands of people at a Minneapolis rally on Oct. 11 .\nThat was the moment Page decided she had to speak up . \u201c I had stayed quiet for years hoping it would fade away , but instead it got worse , \u201d she says . \u201c It had been so hard not to defend myself , to let people who hate me control the narrative . I decided to take my power back . \u201d\nShe is also about to be back in the news cycle in a big way . On Dec. 9 , the Justice Department inspector general report into Trump \u2019 s charges that the FBI spied on his 2016 campaign will come out . Leaked press accounts indicate the report will exonerate Page of the allegation that she acted unprofessionally or showed bias against Trump .\nPage , 40 , is thin and athletic . She speaks in an exceedingly confident , clear , and lawyerly way . But having been through the MAGA meat grinder has clearly worn her down , not unlike the other women I \u2019 ve met who \u2019 ve been subjected to the president \u2019 s abuse . She is just slightly crumbly around the edges the way the president \u2019 s other victims are .\n\u201c It \u2019 s almost impossible to describe \u201d what it \u2019 s like , she told me . \u201c It \u2019 s like being punched in the gut . My heart drops to my stomach when I realize he has tweeted about me again . The president of the United States is calling me names to the entire world . He \u2019 s demeaning me and my career . It \u2019 s sickening . \u201d\n\u201c But it \u2019 s also very intimidating because he \u2019 s still the president of the United States . And when the president accuses you of treason by name , despite the fact that I know there \u2019 s no fathomable way that I have committed any crime at all , let alone treason , he \u2019 s still somebody in a position to actually do something about that . To try to further destroy my life . It never goes away or stops , even when he \u2019 s not publicly attacking me . \u201d\n\u201c I wish it didn \u2019 t , \u201d she said . \u201c I \u2019 m someone who \u2019 s always in my head anyway\u2014so now otherwise normal interactions take on a different meaning . Like , when somebody makes eye contact with me on the Metro , I kind of wince , wondering if it \u2019 s because they recognize me , or are they just scanning the train like people do ? It \u2019 s immediately a question of friend or foe ? Or if I \u2019 m walking down the street or shopping and there \u2019 s somebody wearing Trump gear or a MAGA hat , I \u2019 ll walk the other way or try to put some distance between us because I \u2019 m not looking for conflict . Really , what I wanted most in this world is my life back . \u201d\nLisa Page did not aspire to fame or fortune . She was , she says , \u201c one of those nerdy kids who from very early on knew I wanted work for the government and make the world a better place. \u201d Born in the San Fernando Valley , she and her family moved to Ohio in her teens . She went to American University in Washington , D.C. , and then moved back home to central Ohio to attend law school , living with her parents so she could save money .\nAfter graduating from law school , she was one of an elite group selected for admission in the Department of Justice Honors Program in 2006\u2014and the only woman in her class of five entering the Criminal Division . She worked as a federal prosecutor for six years before moving across the street to the FBI \u2019 s office of general counsel . Soon after her arrival , the deputy general counsel over national-security law hired her for a new special-counsel-type position in 2013 .\n\u201c I start [ in the role ] in early 2013 , and there are two big events that kind of set the trajectory for the rest of my career at the FBI : the Boston bombing in April 2013 , and Edward Snowden \u2019 s leaks in June of the same year , \u201d she told me . \u201c And those are both significant in their own ways , because the Boston bombing introduces me to Andy McCabe , who at the time was the head of the counterterrorism division at the FBI . Two months later , the Snowden leaks hit , which became a transformative moment for the intelligence community , setting off a series of reforms by the Obama administration with respect to the legal authorities that we rely on to collect intelligence . \u201d\nEventually , she was asked to lead that effort , \u201c which gives me a lot of exposure to senior FBI executives , as well as leaders through the IC , DOJ , and White House . \u201d\nPage continued to rise through the ranks of the FBI and was assigned to more significant and substantive work . She became close with McCabe . Eventually she became McCabe \u2019 s special counsel .\nBy February 2016 , she was working on one of the most important investigations at the FBI\u2014the Hillary Clinton email case . \u201c We knew that the case was going to get picked apart , \u201d she says . \u201c And we know there \u2019 s not a person on the FBI team or the DOJ team who thinks this is not the right result . There is no case to be brought here . But it \u2019 s very busy . It \u2019 s very intense . Director [ James ] Comey was very clear he wanted this completed as soon as humanly possible and outside of the political environment . So there was a real focus to get it done before the conventions that were happening that summer . And so that \u2019 s what we did . \u201d\n\u201c But her emails \u201d would soon give way to an actual threat to national security , one that existed not in the fever dreams of Fox News and the Breitbart comments section , but in the real , dangerous world the FBI exists to protect us from , where things like foreign meddling in our elections takes place : strong evidence of Russian interference in the election on behalf of Trump .\n\u201c There are two things that happen in the late summer of 2016 , \u201d Page says . \u201c The first , of course , is that the FBI gets the predication [ courtesy of loose-lipped George Papadopoulos ] , which starts the Russian investigation . We learn about the possibility that there \u2019 s someone on the Trump campaign coordinating with the Russian government in the release of emails , which will damage the Clinton campaign . \u201d\n\u201c Predication \u201d sounds mild for what it really means ; in the summer of 2016 , the FBI and the intelligence community were seeing increasing signs from a variety of intelligence sources and programs ( that Page can not and will not discuss due to classification reasons ) that members of the Trump campaign were tied to a variety of Russian intelligence services , and that the Russian Federation was in the midst of trying to manipulate the 2016 United States election with a sweeping information-warfare and propaganda effort . As The New York Times reported on Nov. 22 , U.S. intel services concluded , and have told Senate Republicans , that Russia mounted a massive disinformation campaign to implicate Ukraine in 2016 meddling and hide its own role .\nAt the end of July 2016 , Page finds herself transitioning from one investigation , the Hillary Clinton email inquiry , to another , the Russian government disinformation probe . Trump is not under investigation , but the FBI is trying to determine if someone associated with his campaign is working with Russia .\n\u201c We were very deliberate and conservative about who we first opened on because we recognized how sensitive a situation it was , \u201d Page says . \u201c So the prospect that we were spying on the campaign or even investigating candidate Trump himself is just false . That \u2019 s not what we were doing . \u201d\nFrom summer 2016 to spring 2017 , Page worked for McCabe , who had become deputy director . They were very busy , but things were largely normal . And then , on May 9 , 2017 , FBI Director Comey was fired . What was that like ?\n\u201c It was horrible , \u201d Page said . \u201c It was a devastating moment at the FBI . It was like a funeral , only worse , because at least when someone dies , you get to come together and celebrate and talk about that person . He was still alive . But he was inaccessible to us . It jolted the ranks and the investigation . It was so abrupt . He was there one day and gone the next . \u201d\n\u201c Well , I mean , all of it was ! \u201d she replied . \u201c The FBI director had just been fired . Yes , it was totally within the authority of the president , but it was unprecedented and unimaginable given the circumstances . The president fired him with the knowledge that , of course , we were investigating Russian contacts with his campaign . I mean , it just gave the aura of an obstructive effort . \u201d\nPage would have probably just been another FBI lawyer if it wasn \u2019 t for the extraordinarily politicized environment and a president who had a habit of attacking career government employees . Page , like many other targets of Trump \u2019 s wrath , felt the pressure both from the external force of his massive social media presence , but also from within the government .\n\u201c At the end of July in 2017 , I am informed by the DOJ Inspector General 's Office that I \u2019 m under investigation for political text messages and honestly , I have no idea what they \u2019 re talking about , \u201d she told me . \u201c I have no recollection . And initially they \u2019 re very coy about it . They don \u2019 t tell me much about it . I don \u2019 t have the first clue what they \u2019 re talking about . What I do know is that my text messages will reveal that I had previously had an affair . I \u2019 m overwhelmed by dread and embarrassment at the prospect that OIG investigators , Andy , and my colleagues , now know or could learn about this deeply personal secret . \u201d\nShe doesn \u2019 t think for a minute that her texts with Peter Strzok are too political . They are largely devoted to work and to talking about family members and various articles they read . The few texts that so convulsed the Republicans involved Page asking for reassurance that Trump wouldn \u2019 t become president , and Strzok replying with \u201c No . No he \u2019 s not . We \u2019 ll stop it. \u201d Glenn Kessler wrote in The Washington Post that \u201c some of the texts reflect a deep animus toward Trump and the way he conducted himself during the 2016 campaign . \u201d\n\u201c Having an opinion and sharing that opinion publicly or privately with another person is squarely within the permissible bounds of the Hatch Act . \u201d\nShe is convinced that she \u2019 s followed the rules . She is , after all , a lawyer and knows that she is a restricted employee under the Hatch Act and can \u2019 t engage in partisan political activity . \u201c And I know I \u2019 m nowhere close to that , \u201d she says . \u201c I don \u2019 t engage in any sort of partisan politicking at all . But having an opinion and sharing that opinion publicly or privately with another person is squarely within the permissible bounds of the Hatch Act . It \u2019 s in the regs . Yeah , it says it plainly . I \u2019 m thinking , I know I \u2019 m a federal employee , but I retain my First Amendment rights . So I \u2019 m really not all that worried about it . \u201d\nSo she hires a lawyer and meets with the IG , who interviews her a number of times . A very small number of people at the FBI know about the investigation , and it stays a secret for six months , and it remains a secret for six months , until the day after Michael Flynn pleads guilty . Then in early December 2017 , the day after Flynn \u2019 s plea , a report comes out about Page being under investigation for political bias\u2014and it includes the affair . The affair was not part of IG \u2019 s investigation and not part of their review .\nThe Inspector General \u2019 s Office had guaranteed Page and Strzok that the affair would not be made public . But then , The Washington Post included the affair in its story . And in a slip of a second , Page goes from being an anonymous government lawyer to playing an unwilling and recurring role in Trump \u2019 s twisted tweetstorms .\n\u201c So now I have to deal with the aftermath of having the most wrong thing I \u2019 ve ever done in my life become public , \u201d she says . \u201c And that \u2019 s when I become the source of the president \u2019 s personal mockery and insults . Because before this moment in time , there \u2019 s not a person outside of my small legal community who knows who I am or what I do . I \u2019 m a normal public servant , just a G-15 , standard-level lawyer , like every other lawyer at the Justice Department . \u201d\nAnd despite how awful that felt , Page had no idea it was going to get much , much worse .\n\u201c After this comes out , there \u2019 s a firestorm , of course , and now the president and the Republicans on the Hill latch on to this , and it becomes about political bias , \u201d she explains . \u201c A week or two later , Rod Rosenstein [ then the deputy attorney general ] was scheduled to testify on the Hill . And the night before his testimony , the Justice Department spokesperson , Sarah Flores , calls the beat reporters into the Justice Department . This is late at night on a weekday . Calls them in to provide a cherry-picked selection of my text messages to review and report on in advance of Rod Rosenstein going to the Hill the next morning . \u201d\nWhy does she think the administration released her text messages ?\n\u201c You \u2019 d have to ask Sarah Flores , \u201d she says . \u201c I can tell you that the reporters there that night were told that they weren \u2019 t allowed to source them to the Justice Department , and that they weren \u2019 t allowed to copy or remove them , just take notes . That \u2019 s what I know . \u201d\n\u201c Those texts were selected for their political impact . They lack a lot of context . Many of them are n't even about him or me . \u201d\nSarah Isgur Flores has left the administration and referred questions to the Justice Department . In 2017 , Flores said that the Justice Department inspector general approved the release of the texts to congressional committees , and that DOJ then provided those texts to reporters who cover the agency after they started to leak out . \u201c As we understand now , some members of the media had already received copies of the texts before that\u2014but those disclosures were not authorized by the department , \u201d Flores said then .\nDOJ declined to comment . As Politico noted at the time , \u201c The DOJ decision to release the text messages to the media and lawmakers before the IG report has drawn criticism from outside the department. \u201d Ben Wittes wrote on the Lawfare blog , \u201c Rosenstein here has , at a minimum , contributed to that circus\u2014at the expense of his own employees . In throwing a career FBI agent and career FBI lawyer to the wolves by authorizing the release to the public of their private text messages\u2014without any finding that they had done anything wrong\u2014he once again sent a message to his workforce that he is not the sort of man with whom you want to share your foxhole . \u201d\nJustice Department officials have said the texts , sent on FBI-issued devices , were subject to public disclosure . In a statement , Rosenstein noted that career Justice Department employees , not political appointees , made the decision to release them . \u201c They were official government records related to FBI business and there was no legal basis to withhold them , so they should be released as requested by Congress , \u201d he said .\nRegardless , Page felt abandoned by the FBI and Justice because of the release of the messages and because the bureau issued no statement defending her and Strzok . \u201c So things get worse , \u201d she continues . \u201c And of course , you know , those texts were selected for their political impact . They lack a lot of context . Many of them aren \u2019 t even about him or me . We \u2019 re not given an opportunity to provide any context . In a lot of those texts we were talking about other people like our family members or articles we had sent each other . \u201d\n\u201c There \u2019 s not really anything to do , \u201d she tells me . \u201c I go back to work . I try to keep my life together. \u201d But she didn \u2019 t stay . She left the FBI in May 2018 ( which is why she says she is now free to talk to the press\u2014she hasn \u2019 t worked for the government for 18 months ) .\nCould she have stayed if she had wanted to ? \u201c No , not for much longer . It was very inhospitable . \u201d\nDoes it feel like a trauma ? \u201c It is . I wouldn \u2019 t even call it PTSD because it \u2019 s not over . It \u2019 s ongoing . It \u2019 s not a historical event that is being relived . It just keeps happening . \u201d\nAnd it \u2019 s still going on ? \u201c I mean , he tweeted about me four days ago , \u201d she told me on Nov. 18 . \u201c When Roger Stone got convicted , he asked , why isn \u2019 t Page in jail too ? Not to mention , you know , his truly reprehensible , degrading stunt at his rally , in which he used my name to simulate an orgasm . And I don \u2019 t ever know when the president \u2019 s going to attack next . And when it happens , it can still sort of upend my day . You don \u2019 t really get used to it . \u201d\nShe doesn \u2019 t use Facebook or Instagram ( and was not on Twitter until this story published ) , so she relies on a group of her close friends\u2014the support system , along with her husband , that has helped her get through the last two years\u2014to be her alert system .\n\u201c I \u2019 ll get a text from a friend alerting me to an outrageous tweet by the president and my first question is always\u2014is it about me ? Often the answer is yes , \u201d she says .\nI ask her about how for about a month back when all this started , Trump called her the \u201c lovely \u201d Lisa Page . She postulates that it \u2019 s possible after her congressional testimony that he saw a picture of her . Which makes as much sense as anything in Trumpworld . One thing becomes quickly apparent talking to Page : What really upset her , what still devastates her , was not the end of her extremely promising career at the FBI , but instead what Trump has done to the FBI itself .\n\u201c It \u2019 s crushing to see the noble Justice Department , my Justice Department , the place I grew up in , feel like it \u2019 s abandoned its principles of truth and independence . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s very painful to see to places like the FBI and the Department of Justice that represent so much of what is excellent about this country , not fulfilling the critical obligation that they have to speak truth to power , \u201d she tells me . \u201c The thing about the FBI that is so extraordinary is that it is made up of a group of men and women whose every instinct is to run toward the fight . It \u2019 s in the fiber of everybody there . It \u2019 s the lifeblood . So it \u2019 s particularly devastating to be betrayed by an organization I still care about so deeply . And it \u2019 s crushing to see the noble Justice Department , my Justice Department , the place I grew up in , feel like it \u2019 s abandoned its principles of truth and independence . \u201d\nPage accepts that her life will never be the same , that there \u2019 s no \u201c normal life \u201d to return to . She \u2019 s still married to her husband and they have two small children . Ultimately , she was just another public servant like Fiona Hill or Marie Yovanovitch . She was dragged into the spotlight , her text messages weaponized , and her life destroyed so that the Trump administration could have a brief distraction .\nThe era of Trump populism always had an ugly edge , particularly toward women . Trump revels in bringing misery to his opponents and will always seek out and exploit any weakness . Page \u201c wasn \u2019 t nice to him , \u201d and so in his eyes she can be endlessly targeted and assaulted .\nIt \u2019 s tempting to describe this as just part of Trump \u2019 s deep , baked-in misogyny and sociopathy , but in Page \u2019 s case it \u2019 s worse ; it \u2019 s a sign of how deeply he \u2019 s corrupted the government to serve his will and his whims . His apologists have become part of Trump \u2019 s own squad of witch-hunters , hunting fantasies like \u201c Ukrainian interference \u201d while attacking the people who tried to protect us from Russian attacks .\nIt \u2019 s not just that Lisa Page may never be safe as long as Trump is president .\nCORRECTION : In the original version of this article , the sentence describing the Nov. 22 report in The New York Times about intel services briefing Senate Republicans on Russia trying to implicate Ukraine in 2016 election meddling was in quotation marks . That sentence is in fact a paraphrase .",

Leaked press accounts indicate the report will exonerate Page of the allegation that she acted unprofessionally or showed bias against Trump.\n\nHow does it feel after all this time to finally have the IG apparently affirm what she\u2019s been saying all along? She said she wouldn\u2019t discuss the findings until they were officially public, but she did note: \u201cWhile it would be nice to have the IG confirm publicly that my personal opinions had absolutely no bearing on the course of the Russia investigations, I don\u2019t kid myself that the fact will matter very much for a lot of people. The president has a very loud megaphone.\u201d\n\nPage, 40, is thin and athletic. She speaks in an exceedingly confident, clear, and lawyerly way. But having been through the MAGA meat grinder has clearly worn her down, not unlike the other women I\u2019ve met who\u2019ve been subjected to the president\u2019s abuse. She is just slightly crumbly around the edges the way the president\u2019s other victims are.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to describe\u201d what it\u2019s like, she told me. \u201cIt\u2019s like being punched in the gut.

It\u2019s immediately a question of friend or foe? Or if I\u2019m walking down the street or shopping and there\u2019s somebody wearing Trump gear or a MAGA hat, I\u2019ll walk the other way or try to put some distance between us because I\u2019m not looking for conflict. Really, what I wanted most in this world is my life back.\u201d\n\nRising Through the Ranks\n\nLisa Page did not aspire to fame or fortune. She was, she says, \u201cone of those nerdy kids who from very early on knew I wanted work for the government and make the world a better place.\u201d Born in the San Fernando Valley, she and her family moved to Ohio in her teens. She went to American University in Washington, D.C., and then moved back home to central Ohio to attend law school, living with her parents so she could save money.\n\nAfter graduating from law school, she was one of an elite group selected for admission in the Department of Justice Honors Program in 2006\u2014and the only woman in her class of five entering the Criminal Division. She worked as a federal prosecutor for six years before moving across the street to the FBI\u2019s office of general counsel. Soon after her arrival, the deputy general counsel over national-security law hired her for a new special-counsel-type position in 2013.\n\nOnce there, her path begins to be set.\n\n\u201cI start [in the role] in early 2013, and there are two big events that kind of set the trajectory for the rest of my career at the FBI: the Boston bombing in April 2013, and Edward Snowden\u2019s leaks in June of the same year,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd those are both significant in their own ways, because the Boston bombing introduces me to Andy McCabe, who at the time was the head of the counterterrorism division at the FBI.

We learn about the possibility that there\u2019s someone on the Trump campaign coordinating with the Russian government in the release of emails, which will damage the Clinton campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cPredication\u201d sounds mild for what it really means; in the summer of 2016, the FBI and the intelligence community were seeing increasing signs from a variety of intelligence sources and programs (that Page cannot and will not discuss due to classification reasons) that members of the Trump campaign were tied to a variety of Russian intelligence services, and that the Russian Federation was in the midst of trying to manipulate the 2016 United States election with a sweeping information-warfare and propaganda effort. As The New York Times reported on Nov. 22, U.S. intel services concluded, and have told Senate Republicans, that Russia mounted a massive disinformation campaign to implicate Ukraine in 2016 meddling and hide its own role.\n\nAt the end of July 2016, Page finds herself transitioning from one investigation, the Hillary Clinton email inquiry, to another, the Russian government disinformation probe. Trump is not under investigation, but the FBI is trying to determine if someone associated with his campaign is working with Russia.\n\n\u201cWe were very deliberate and conservative about who we first opened on because we recognized how sensitive a situation it was,\u201d Page says. \u201cSo the prospect that we were spying on the campaign or even investigating candidate Trump himself is just false. That\u2019s not what we were doing.\u201d\n\nFrom Anonymity to Infamy\n\nFrom summer 2016 to spring 2017, Page worked for McCabe, who had become deputy director. They were very busy, but things were largely normal. And then, on May 9, 2017, FBI Director Comey was fired. What was that like?\n\n\u201c It was horrible,\u201d Page said. \u201cIt was a devastating moment at the FBI. It was like a funeral, only worse, because at least when someone dies, you get to come together and celebrate and talk about that person. He was still alive. But he was inaccessible to us. It jolted the ranks and the investigation. It was so abrupt. He was there one day and gone the next.\u201d\n\nWas that very unusual?\n\n\u201cWell, I mean, all of it was!\u201d she replied. \u201cThe FBI director had just been fired. Yes, it was totally within the authority of the president, but it was unprecedented and unimaginable given the circumstances. The president fired him with the knowledge that, of course, we were investigating Russian contacts with his campaign. I mean, it just gave the aura of an obstructive effort.\u201d\n\nPage would have probably just been another FBI lawyer if it wasn\u2019t for the extraordinarily politicized environment and a president who had a habit of attacking career government employees. Page, like many other targets of Trump\u2019s wrath, felt the pressure both from the external force of his massive social media presence, but also from within the government.\n\n\u201cAt the end of July in 2017, I am informed by the DOJ Inspector General's Office that I\u2019m under investigation for political text messages and honestly, I have no idea what they\u2019re talking about,\u201d she told me. \u201cI have no recollection. And initially they\u2019re very coy about it. They don\u2019t tell me much about it. I don\u2019t have the first clue what they\u2019re talking about. What I do know is that my text messages will reveal that I had previously had an affair. I\u2019m overwhelmed by dread and embarrassment at the prospect that OIG investigators, Andy, and my colleagues, now know or could learn about this deeply personal secret.\u201d\n\nShe doesn\u2019t think for a minute that her texts with Peter Strzok are too political. They are largely devoted to work and to talking about family members and various articles they read. The few texts that so convulsed the Republicans involved Page asking for reassurance that Trump wouldn\u2019t become president, and Strzok replying with \u201cNo. No he\u2019s not. We\u2019ll stop it.\u201d Glenn Kessler wrote in The Washington Post that \u201csome of the texts reflect a deep animus toward Trump and the way he conducted himself during the 2016 campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201c Having an opinion and sharing that opinion publicly or privately with another person is squarely within the permissible bounds of the Hatch Act. \u201d\n\nShe is convinced that she\u2019s followed the rules. She is, after all, a lawyer and knows that she is a restricted employee under the Hatch Act and can\u2019t engage in partisan political activity. \u201cAnd I know I\u2019m nowhere close to that,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t engage in any sort of partisan politicking at all. But having an opinion and sharing that opinion publicly or privately with another person is squarely within the permissible bounds of the Hatch Act. It\u2019s in the regs. Yeah, it says it plainly. I\u2019m thinking, I know I\u2019m a federal employee, but I retain my First Amendment rights. So I\u2019m really not all that worried about it.\u201d\n\nSo she hires a lawyer and meets with the IG, who interviews her a number of times. A very small number of people at the FBI know about the investigation, and it stays a secret for six months, and it remains a secret for six months, until the day after Michael Flynn pleads guilty. Then in early December 2017, the day after Flynn\u2019s plea, a report comes out about Page being under investigation for political bias\u2014and it includes the affair. The affair was not part of IG\u2019s investigation and not part of their review.\n\nThe Inspector General\u2019s Office had guaranteed Page and Strzok that the affair would not be made public. But then, The Washington Post included the affair in its story. And in a slip of a second, Page goes from being an anonymous government lawyer to playing an unwilling and recurring role in Trump\u2019s twisted tweetstorms.\n\n\u201cSo now I have to deal with the aftermath of having the most wrong thing I\u2019ve ever done in my life become public,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when I become the source of the president\u2019s personal mockery and insults. Because before this moment in time, there\u2019s not a person outside of my small legal community who knows who I am or what I do. I\u2019m a normal public servant, just a G-15, standard-level lawyer, like every other lawyer at the Justice Department.\u201d\n\nAnd despite how awful that felt, Page had no idea it was going to get much, much worse.\n\nTrump\u2019s \u2018Truly Reprehensible... Stunt\u2019\n\n\u201cAfter this comes out, there\u2019s a firestorm, of course, and now the president and the Republicans on the Hill latch on to this, and it becomes about political bias,\u201d she explains. \u201cA week or two later, Rod Rosenstein [then the deputy attorney general] was scheduled to testify on the Hill. And the night before his testimony, the Justice Department spokesperson, Sarah Flores, calls the beat reporters into the Justice Department. This is late at night on a weekday. Calls them in to provide a cherry-picked selection of my text messages to review and report on in advance of Rod Rosenstein going to the Hill the next morning.\u201d\n\nWhy does she think the administration released her text messages?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to ask Sarah Flores,\u201d she says. \u201cI can tell you that the reporters there that night were told that they weren\u2019t allowed to source them to the Justice Department, and that they weren\u2019t allowed to copy or remove them, just take notes. That\u2019s what I know.\u201d\n\n\u201c Those texts were selected for their political impact. They lack a lot of context. Many of them aren't even about him or me. \u201d\n\nSarah Isgur Flores has left the administration and referred questions to the Justice Department. In 2017, Flores said that the Justice Department inspector general approved the release of the texts to congressional committees, and that DOJ then provided those texts to reporters who cover the agency after they started to leak out. \u201cAs we understand now, some members of the media had already received copies of the texts before that\u2014but those disclosures were not authorized by the department,\u201d Flores said then.\n\nDOJ declined to comment. As Politico noted at the time, \u201cThe DOJ decision to release the text messages to the media and lawmakers before the IG report has drawn criticism from outside the department.\u201d Ben Wittes wrote on the Lawfare blog, \u201cRosenstein here has, at a minimum, contributed to that circus\u2014at the expense of his own employees. In throwing a career FBI agent and career FBI lawyer to the wolves by authorizing the release to the public of their private text messages\u2014without any finding that they had done anything wrong\u2014he once again sent a message to his workforce that he is not the sort of man with whom you want to share your foxhole.\u201d\n\nJustice Department officials have said the texts, sent on FBI-issued devices, were subject to public disclosure. In a statement, Rosenstein noted that career Justice Department employees, not political appointees, made the decision to release them. \u201cThey were official government records related to FBI business and there was no legal basis to withhold them, so they should be released as requested by Congress,\u201d he said.\n\nRegardless, Page felt abandoned by the FBI and Justice because of the release of the messages and because the bureau issued no statement defending her and Strzok. \u201cSo things get worse,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd of course, you know, those texts were selected for their political impact. They lack a lot of context. Many of them aren\u2019t even about him or me. We\u2019re not given an opportunity to provide any context. In a lot of those texts we were talking about other people like our family members or articles we had sent each other.\u201d\n\nI ask her what she did next.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not really anything to do,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI go back to work. I try to keep my life together.\u201d But she didn\u2019t stay. She left the FBI in May 2018 (which is why she says she is now free to talk to the press\u2014she hasn\u2019t worked for the government for 18 months).\n\nCould she have stayed if she had wanted to? \u201cNo, not for much longer. It was very inhospitable.\u201d\n\nDoes it feel like a trauma? \u201cIt is. I wouldn\u2019t even call it PTSD because it\u2019s not over. It\u2019s ongoing. It\u2019s not a historical event that is being relived. It just keeps happening.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s still going on? \u201cI mean, he tweeted about me four days ago,\u201d she told me on Nov. 18. \u201cWhen Roger Stone got convicted, he asked, why isn\u2019t Page in jail too? Not to mention, you know, his truly reprehensible, degrading stunt at his rally, in which he used my name to simulate an orgasm. And I don\u2019t ever know when the president\u2019s going to attack next. And when it happens, it can still sort of upend my day. You don\u2019t really get used to it.\u201d\n\nWatching the Justice Dept. Collapse\n\nShe doesn\u2019t use Facebook or Instagram (and was not on Twitter until this story published), so she relies on a group of her close friends\u2014the support system, along with her husband, that has helped her get through the last two years\u2014to be her alert system.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get a text from a friend alerting me to an outrageous tweet by the president and my first question is always\u2014is it about me? Often the answer is yes,\u201d she says.\n\nI ask her about how for about a month back when all this started, Trump called her the \u201clovely\u201d Lisa Page. She postulates that it\u2019s possible after her congressional testimony that he saw a picture of her. Which makes as much sense as anything in Trumpworld. One thing becomes quickly apparent talking to Page: What really upset her, what still devastates her, was not the end of her extremely promising career at the FBI, but instead what Trump has done to the FBI itself.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s crushing to see the noble Justice Department, my Justice Department, the place I grew up in, feel like it\u2019s abandoned its principles of truth and independence. \u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very painful to see to places like the FBI and the Department of Justice that represent so much of what is excellent about this country, not fulfilling the critical obligation that they have to speak truth to power,\u201d she tells me. \u201cThe thing about the FBI that is so extraordinary is that it is made up of a group of men and women whose every instinct is to run toward the fight. It\u2019s in the fiber of everybody there. It\u2019s the lifeblood. So it\u2019s particularly devastating to be betrayed by an organization I still care about so deeply. And it\u2019s crushing to see the noble Justice Department, my Justice Department, the place I grew up in, feel like it\u2019s abandoned its principles of truth and independence.\u201d\n\nPage accepts that her life will never be the same, that there\u2019s no \u201cnormal life\u201d to return to. She\u2019s still married to her husband and they have two small children. Ultimately, she was just another public servant like Fiona Hill or Marie Yovanovitch. She was dragged into the spotlight, her text messages weaponized, and her life destroyed so that the Trump administration could have a brief distraction.\n\nThe era of Trump populism always had an ugly edge, particularly toward women. Trump revels in bringing misery to his opponents and will always seek out and exploit any weakness. Page \u201cwasn\u2019t nice to him,\u201d and so in his eyes she can be endlessly targeted and assaulted.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to describe this as just part of Trump\u2019s deep, baked-in misogyny and sociopathy, but in Page\u2019s case it\u2019s worse; it\u2019s a sign of how deeply he\u2019s corrupted the government to serve his will and his whims. His apologists have become part of Trump\u2019s own squad of witch-hunters, hunting fantasies like \u201cUkrainian interference\u201d while attacking the people who tried to protect us from Russian attacks.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that Lisa Page may never be safe as long as Trump is president.\n\nIt\u2019s that we won\u2019t be safe, either.\n\nCORRECTION: In the original version of this article, the sentence describing the Nov. 22 report in The New York Times about intel services briefing Senate Republicans on Russia trying to implicate Ukraine in 2016 election meddling was in quotation marks. That sentence is in fact a paraphrase.",
