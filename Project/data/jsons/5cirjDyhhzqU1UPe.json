    "content": "The predominance of former military men in Trump \u2019 s inner circle is a threat to our national security .\nWhen President Trump picked John Kelly , the retired four-star Marine general who had been leading the Department of Homeland Security , as his new chief of staff , most people were relieved .\nThis is no accident . Poll after poll reveals that the military is essentially the only institution that Americans still trust . Consider the alternatives : politicians , party hacks , lawyers , big-shot CEOs , labor leaders , and finance executives are all immediately derided , even when we know nothing about them personally . Appointing any one of them would be a political risk . Only generals , despite the outcomes of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , still seem to merit the goodwill of the American people .\nThis is a testament to the continuing strength of American patriotism . It is also a good thing : We need civilians to have confidence in the military . But what if placing so many generals in positions of political leadership could endanger that trust ? And how many generals in the situation room are too many ? Answering these questions will reveal why the appointment of General Kelly , even though he may be qualified and seems intent on bringing order to the West Wing , is bad for our national security .\nThe American people \u2019 s confidence in the military is a pillar of American strength . In a democratic society , popular support is necessary to sustain the allocation of outsize levels of funding to defense . And such funding , of course , allows us to project power across the world , protecting the liberal order .\nBut as Bob Kagan has written , this mission requires more than money . It is also a \u201c heavy moral burden for a democratic people to bear. \u201d The American people must trust their nation and its military to operate competently , justly , and in their own best interests . If this trust were to be shaken , little would stop Americans from simply shrugging off the burden Kagan describes . Our ability to meet our international commitments and craft a superpower \u2019 s foreign policy would rapidly diminish .\nThat is why we should be grateful that 72 percent of Americans have \u201c a great deal \u201d or \u201c quite a lot \u201d of confidence in the military . As the Hoover Institution \u2019 s Kori Schake , co-author \u2014 along with Defense Secretary James Mattis , himself a former general \u2014 of a book on civil\u2013military relations , has written , \u201c Part of the reason the U.S. military is venerated by the American public is that they are considered apolitical . The trust on which our system of civil-military relations relies is made much more difficult when veterans engage in blatant partisan politics . \u201d\nWe shouldn \u2019 t threaten that confidence by placing so many recently retired generals in political positions . For example , Trump may well demand that General Kelly , like Reince Priebus before him , blatantly lie to the public in his defense , or aggressively attack the media and Democrats . Seeing Kelly become a hack in the service of a particularly divisive president would reflect poorly upon the military , tarnishing its prestige in the eyes of Trump \u2019 s many political opponents .\nIt is not difficult to imagine General Kelly performing an overtly partisan role . Once , in handing the president a ceremonial saber , he joked that Trump should use it on the press . In April , Kelly said that if lawmakers do not like the laws that the executive branch enforces , they should change them . Otherwise , he suggested , they should \u201c shut up and support the men and women on the front lines. \u201d No one should tell Congress to \u201c shut up , \u201d but when a general does so , it inevitably means something more .\nIn a time of such political polarization , this is extremely dangerous to the long-term health of the U.S. military , the institution that keeps us safe .\nThat Kelly is a retired general is irrelevant ; he is still widely perceived as a military man . We , along with the president , call him \u201c General Kelly \u201d for a reason . Watching a military leader quickly transition from general to controversial political partisan , as Trump demands , rank-and-file Democrats may feel that the military is taking sides . In a time of such political polarization , this is extremely dangerous to the long-term health of the U.S. military , the institution that keeps us safe .\nSome will argue that it is even more important to have Kelly \u2019 s experienced military presence by the president \u2019 s side . Perhaps this would be convincing if Trump did not already have so many generals in key civilian positions . General H. R. McMaster was chosen to be the national security adviser , the president \u2019 s chief in-house aid on these important questions . General Mattis was chosen and received a special waiver to take charge of the military itself .\nThese positions are usually reserved for civilians , to ensure civilian oversight of the military , and to balance out the advice of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . Now add General Kelly as the president \u2019 s chief of staff , in charge of access to the Oval Office , and military men will surround Trump . It falls to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to bring a different point of view , but he is a foreign-policy novice , like President Trump himself . Neither has the wealth of experience to confidently or capably stand up to the generals in the Situation Room .\nOne can point to General Al Haig , who became chief of staff under President Nixon in 1973 , as precedent . But Haig was not joined by other generals in key civilian positions . Throughout his tenure , both the secretary of defense and the national security adviser were civilians .

Rex Tillerson , needless to say , is no Henry Kissinger .\nMy worry is not John Kelly . It is that there will not be a substantial civilian presence to advise Trump on military issues , and think differently from the military brass , subordinating military objectives to larger American political interests . In such circumstances , groupthink will become even more dangerous than it usually is ; when everybody thinks the same , nobody thinks anything at all .\nAlready , Trump has shown incredible deference to his generals , delegating control over troop levels in Afghanistan to Mattis and the Pentagon . Some may mistakenly find this abandonment of civilian political control reassuring , but they forget that \u201c War is too important to be left to the generals , \u201d as Georges Clemenceau once put it .\nThis understanding of war begins with Carl von Clausewitz \u2019 s famous observation that \u201c War is not merely an act of policy but a true political instrument , a continuation of political intercourse , carried on with other means. \u201d The goals of military action are political in their nature , and thus subject to political debate and control .
