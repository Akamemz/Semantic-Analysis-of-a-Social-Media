Three weeks later , on a hunting trip in Texas , the conservative icon died in his sleep .\nSince then , the year has been one long roller-coaster ride for the Supreme Court , with the eight remaining justices putting off the most controversial cases while President Obama and the U.S. Senate struggled over filling the vacancy .\nRepublicans were shocked and horrified at Scalia 's death .
