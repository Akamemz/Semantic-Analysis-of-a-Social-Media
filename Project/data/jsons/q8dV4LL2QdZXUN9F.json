    "content": "While the majority of jobless Americans currently collecting unemployment believe they 'll be recalled to work within six months , a recent report from the University of Chicago 's Becker Friedman Institute predicts that 42 % of all jobs lost during the first six weeks of the coronavirus pandemic will become permanent . As of May , more than 15 million Americans were on furlough , or temporarily laid off from work , according to the Labor Department 's latest jobs report . ( The Bureau of Labor statistics acknowledges that the number of furloughed workers is likely higher due to classification errors ) . Though the jobs report shows evidence of a slow economic rebound \u2014 employment rose by 2.5 million as the country began to reopen after weeks of shutdown and devastating unemployment \u2014 it 's still possible a temporary furlough could become a permanent layoff . \u2588\u2588\u2588 Make It spoke with employment experts to understand what workers should know if they find themselves in this situation .\nYour employer may have to notify you of a layoff in advance\nDepending on where you live and who you work for , your employer may have to give you a certain amount of advance warning that your furlough will become a permanent layoff . The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification , or WARN , Act , says employers with 100 or more full-time employees may be required to provide at least 60 days written notice of certain group terminations . This can include a plant closure , where 50 or more full-time employees lose their jobs at one facility within the organization . It also applies to a mass layoff , defined as when an employer lays off 50 to 499 workers who make up at least one-third of the workforce , or a layoff of 500 or more people at the organization within a certain time period . Generally , the WARN Act requires covered employers give affected employees 60 days notice of a layoff . They 'll also be required to notify employees if they expect their furlough period to last more than six months . In some instances , your employer may be able to give less advance notice if they can prove the layoff is a result of business circumstances that are n't `` reasonably foreseeable . '' This can include an unexpected and dramatic major economic downturn , or a government-ordered closing of an employment site without prior notice , both of which could be applied due to the pandemic . Still , employers remain responsible for informing employees with as much warning as possible . While guidelines are provided by the U.S. Department of Labor , violations are addressed after the fact through private legal action brought in the U.S. District Courts . Employers proven to have failed to follow the WARN Act may face penalties , and workers may be entitled to wages for each day of violation up to 60 days . Amber Clayton , knowledge center director for the Society for Human Resource Management , adds that some states may have stricter clauses under the WARN Act , such as a lower threshold of what counts as a mass layoff , a longer period of required advance notice before a layoff , or when an employer can be exempt from coverage . You can check if you 're protected , and to what extent , from your state 's department of labor site . Union members may also be protected by their collective bargaining agreements and should check for further details with their union representative .\nDepending on the state , you may have already received your final paycheck on the last day you worked before being furloughed . This final paycheck may have included payout of any accrued vacation time or bonuses . If you 're entitled to this payout but did n't receive it before being furloughed , you should expect it on the date of your final termination , within a certain number of business days following your termination or on the following payday . Your final paycheck will also account for any work you may have done intermittently during your furlough , which will depend if you were hourly or salaried . According to insurance review site Policygenius , seven states require payment for unused vacation following a layoff , 37 require payment if it 's included in an employment contract or the company follows a PTO accrual system and the remaining six states do n't have legislation regarding paying out PTO after a worker leaves . Unused paid sick time is generally not included in a final paycheck .\nHave a plan for your health coverage , retirement account and employer-sponsored benefits\nFurloughed employees generally maintain their health-care coverage and some other employer-sponsored benefits while they 're not working . If your furlough becomes a layoff , you 'll need to figure out a new plan for your health-care coverage . One option may be through the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act , or COBRA , which entitles workers who 've lost their jobs to stay on their employer 's health insurance plan for up to 18 months . This can be an expensive option , however , as you 'll be responsible for 100 % of your premiums , plus a 2 % administrative fee . You may be able to ask whether your employer can cover some or all of these costs for either the full 18-month period , or until you 're able to get insurance through a spouse 's plan , through the marketplace or from another alternative .\nIf you receive life insurance or disability income insurance from your employer , discuss whether they can extend coverage for a period of time after you 're laid off . One month is a good place to start . Clayton adds you can consider whether to port your existing group coverage to an individual plan , or to another plan with a new employer . Have a plan for other health coverage , such as dental and vision insurance . Your employer can tell you what your options are for these moving forward , or they may direct you to contact the administrator of each work-sponsored benefit to understand exactly what will happen to your coverage after termination . If you have a 401 ( k ) through work , understand whether you can keep the funds where they are , or if you 'll need to roll it into another investment vehicle by a certain deadline . You may also want to think about other discounts you 've gotten through work , whether that 's a phone plan , internet package or membership to a gym or wellness services , Clayton adds . Try going directly to the service provider , letting them know your situation and asking if they can continue your service at the same rate as you got through your employer , she says .\nThere 's no requirement under the Fair Labor Standards Act that mandates companies provide severance following a layoff . However , according to a survey from Randstad Risesmart , an outplacement service , 56 % of HR leaders reported they offered severance to all employees following an involuntary separation ; the remaining 44 % offered it to only some employees , primarily officers , senior executives and managers with the company . Unionized workers may be entitled to severance based on the terms of their collective bargaining agreement . A severance agreement will often outline what kind of pay and benefits you 'll receive after termination , provided that you agree to a non-compete clause , a non-disclosure agreement or terms you wo n't sue or disparage the company . If you 're presented a severance agreement , it may be worth calling in legal counsel to review its terms , and remember that you do n't have to respond to it right away . Under the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act , employees over 40 must be given 21 days to consider the offer ; after signing , they have seven days to change their decision . If you and at least one other person are laid off in a group termination , you 'll have 45 days to consider a severance offer , regardless of age .",
