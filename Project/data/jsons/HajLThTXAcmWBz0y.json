    "content": "What do we know about Emily Doe ? We know she was sexually assaulted by Brock Turner outside a frat party at Stanford University , California , one night in January 2015 . She was found unconscious and partly-clothed , near a dumpster .\nHe would get a six-month term , for sexually assaulting an intoxicated victim , sexually assaulting an unconscious victim and attempting to rape her .\nHe would serve three months and be put on probation for three years , ending this month . Judge Aaron Persky , who was later removed from his post , cited Turner 's good character and the fact he had been drinking .\nMuch of the coverage at the time also focused on the fact Turner was a star swimmer .\nWhat do we know about Chanel Miller ? Maybe you do n't know a lot , yet . If you 've read the victim impact statement she addressed to Turner , which went viral when she was still known as Emily Doe to protect her anonymity , you 'll know she is brave and articulate .\nShe is a literature graduate , who has now written a book , Know My Name . She is a talented artist and would love to illustrate children 's books , her drawings being a little surreal and - by her own description - sinister . She has also studied ceramics and comic books , and done stand-up comedy .\nShe loves dogs . She describes herself as shy . She is half-Chinese , her Chinese name being Zhang Xiao Xia ( with Xia sounding like `` sha '' , the first syllable of Chanel ) . She smiles easily , is thoughtful and funny . She is someone 's daughter , sister , girlfriend . She could be someone you know .\nWarning : This story contains content that readers may find distressing\nChanel 's memoir brims with the rage of her ordeal . But why write it , when it meant reliving her pain , reading the court documents and witness statements that had been - until then - kept from her ?\nShe says she felt a duty to shine a light on the darkness so many young women have to go through .\n`` I 've had days where it 's extremely difficult to get up in the morning , '' says Chanel , 27 , speaking in her home city of San Francisco . `` I 've had days where I really could not imagine a single pathway forward . And those were such weighing times .\n`` And it was terrible . I would n't draw anything , I would n't write anything . All I wanted to do is sleep so that I would n't have to be conscious . That 's no way to live .\n`` I think of other young women who have to go through this and you see them withdraw and crumble and fall away from the things that they love . And I just think - how , how do we let that happen ? ''\nHer voice is articulate and clear but it vibrates with emotion , and quiet fury , at the injustice of this happening to other women around the world . An endless parade of other people who know what it is to be Emily Doe .\n`` Here are these young , talented women excited for their futures , who have so many things to give and offer . And something like this happens , '' says Chanel . `` And they go home , and they carry the shame , and they swallow it up and it eats them from the inside out .\n`` And they think 'everything would be better off if I was just holed up in my room ' , 'maybe things would be better if I did n't speak at all ' . 'Maybe I do n't deserve to be loved or caressed gently ' .\n`` It 's so sick , that we let this happen . That we let them digest these negative ideas of themselves . And let them be isolated . Instead of coaxing them back out here and saying , no , you deserve a full life . You deserve an amazing future . ''\nChanel was n't a university student at the time - she had already graduated . Her younger sister Tiffany was back home for the weekend and had asked if she wanted to go along to a party with her .\nBut her story expanded the conversation about campus rape and she wants to see changes at Stanford University specifically , like the fact forensic exams ca n't be given at Stanford hospital , with victims having to travel 40 miles .\n`` Do you get an Uber for 40 minutes with a stranger while you 're still in the clothes you were just attacked in ? Do you text your one friend who has a car and disclose that information ? ''\nMany women came forward after reading Chanel 's victim impact statement , emboldened to tell their own stories - in some cases for the first time .\nRAINN - the rape , abuse and incest national network , the largest anti-sexual violence organisation in the US - puts the figure at one in six US women being the victim of an attempted , or completed , rape . Every 92 seconds , an American is sexually assaulted . Out of every 1,000 sexual assaults , 995 perpetrators will walk free .\nThink of how many women you walk past each day . Think of one in every six .\n`` We always say like , oh , why did n't she come forward ? Why did n't she report ? '' says Chanel .\n`` Because there 's no system for her to report to . Why should she have faith in us to take care of her if she comes forward ? We need to be doing more to help survivors after this happens . ''\nWhen Turner was sentenced , the crime was not described as rape - but the law in California has since changed , as a result of Chanel 's case .\nThere is now a mandatory three year minimum prison sentence for penetrating an unconscious person or an intoxicated person , Chanel 's attorney Alaleh Kianerci explains . Another piece of legislation was written to expand the definition of rape to include any kind of penetration ( `` The trauma experienced by survivors can not be measured by what exactly was put inside them without their consent , '' she argued , in her support of the bill ) .\nShe had felt so beaten down by the court case ( `` I just felt degraded and empty all the time , '' she says ) and the shock of Turner 's sentence that when her lawyer asked her permission to release her victim impact statement , she just said `` sure , if you think it 'd be helpful '' . She thought it would end up on a community forum or local newspaper website - never imagining the impact it would have .\nWhen her statement came out , originally published in full on Buzzfeed , it received 11 million views in four days and Chanel was sent hundreds and hundreds of letters and gifts from around the world .\nShe read them all , saying they `` taught me to be gentler to myself , taught me who I was to them '' , adding : `` I was learning to see myself through them . ''\nShe even got a letter from the White House - Joe Biden , then vice-president , telling her : `` You have given them the strength they need to fight . And so , I believe , you will save lives . ''\nAs she was anonymous , it was common for friends to forward the statement to her , unaware she had written it . Chanel 's therapist knew she had been sexually assaulted but did not know her identity as Emily Doe for months , asking her : `` Have you read the Stanford victim statement ? ''\nCourts hear from cases like Chanel 's all the time - it 's just the names , the places , the details change . So what made her story , her pain , resonate so widely ?\n`` Maybe not shying away from the darkest parts , '' Chanel says . `` I think it feels almost like a relief when someone acknowledges your darkness because you feel like it 's this ugly , dirty thing you need to be concealing .\n`` If you show it , people are going to cringe and back away . I could communicate all of these difficult feelings and be open about them and just lay them out and not feel shame for experiencing them . ''\nHaving been through the court system , Chanel said she felt she had a responsibility to report back , to show others what it is like .\n`` I know that for me , I had so many , quote unquote , advantages , '' she says . `` I had my rape kit done [ a sexual assault forensic evidence kit ] . I had the assistance of policemen and nurses . I had an advocate that was assigned to me , I had a prosecutor , I had all the things you 're supposed to have .\n`` And I still found it so excruciatingly difficult and emotionally damaging and going through it . I thought , 'if this is what it looks like , to be well equipped going into this , how the hell is anyone else supposed to survive this process ? ' .\n`` I felt that I had a duty to write about what it 's like inside the windowless walls of a courtroom , what the internal landscape is like , what it 's like to sit on that stand and be attacked with this meaningless interrogation . ''\nWriting the book also allowed her access to the court documents and thousands of pages of transcripts she had not been present for .\nWhile elucidating , it was also deeply painful , knowing what not just the court - but her family and friends had heard and seen .\n`` It was extremely difficult . I put it off for a really long time . Finally , I thought well , I have to look into them .\n`` I would read about Brock and the defence talking about , play by play , taking off my underwear , putting his fingers inside\u2026 , '' she stops , before adding : `` It was so graphic and suffocating , to read about myself being verbally undressed again .\n`` And to imagine it all happening in a courtroom where everyone 's just listening and nobody 's doing anything . I could not stomach it . ''\nIt caused her anger and `` self-induced depression '' but says there was `` this wonderful moment where I 'm like , all of these voices in these transcripts are literally in my hands , I can pick them up and put them down . But I own all of them . I get to pick out whichever words I want and assemble them how I want '' .\n`` There is a lot of power in being able to craft the narrative again , '' she adds .\nKnow My Name brims with the trauma Chanel experienced - from waking up not knowing what had happened , to learning details of the assault from news reports , to finally telling her parents , to breaking down in court . As she says , `` writing is the way I process the world '' .\nChanel only chose to reveal her name six months ago , having started writing the book in 2017 .\nShe says the burden of secrecy had become too much for her - 90 % of people who knew her did n't know her other identity .\nFriends thought she was still doing her 9-5 office job . So she had former colleagues ( `` my suppliers '' , she smiles ) feed her snippets of information . `` In the beginning that was so important for self-preservation and processing and privacy , '' she says . `` But over time , you feel really diminished . And I think it 's important to be able to live my full truth . ''\nShe expected the day , earlier this month , when she came out as Chanel to be `` stormy '' . But it was , in the end , a moment of deep calm and strength .\n`` It turned out to be the most peaceful day I 've had in the last four-and-a-half years , '' says Chanel . `` I suddenly realised , I 've come out on the other side of this . ''\nShe does n't feel Turner - who denied all of the charges - has acknowledged what he did .\n`` You know , at the sentencing , he read 10 sentences of apology , '' she says . `` It sounded generic to me .\n`` And it really made me question what we 're doing in the criminal justice system , because if he 's not even learning , then really what is the point ? If he had transformed himself , then I think I would have been much more forgiving of the sentence .\n`` I am really interested in self-growth and understanding that the fact that he deviated so far from that , and was never forced to do any kind of introspection , or to really look at the way he affected me , that really hurt . ''\nWe applaud Chanel Miller 's bravery in telling her story publicly , and we deeply regret that she was sexually assaulted on the Stanford campus . As a university , we are continuing and strengthening our efforts to prevent and respond effectively to sexual violence , with the ultimate goal of eradicating it from our community .\nThe closest location for a SART [ sexual assault response team ] exam is at Valley Medical Center in San Jose . We have long agreed on the need for a closer location and have committed to provide space at Stanford Hospital for SART exams . Santa Clara County , which runs the SART program , is working to train sufficient nurses to staff it .\nMuch of the criticism towards Judge Aaron Persky was about the relatively lenient sentence given to Turner - sparking a national debate about whether white men from wealthy backgrounds were treated more favourably by the US justice system .\n`` Privilege is not having to reckon with his own actions to examine his effects on someone who is not him , '' says Chanel .\n`` You know , we have young men of colour serving far longer sentences for nonviolent crimes for having marijuana possession . It 's ridiculous .\n`` I just kept thinking , where does the punishment come in ? When are you forced to be held accountable for what you do in life and not just float through , as if anything you do can never hurt anybody , and you will not be affected by it .\n`` I think what bothers me the most is that there 's never the suggestion that the victim was also busy having a life before this happened .\n`` We have our own agendas and goals , and do n't appreciate being completely thrown off the rails when this happens . And when people say , why did n't she report ? It 's like , casually asking , why did n't she stop everything she was doing to attend to something that she never wanted to attend to in the first place ? ''\nTurner attempted to have his convictions overturned last year , but his appeal was rejected . He remains on the sex offenders register . Turner was banned from the university and is now living with his parents in Ohio .\nAsked whether she would like Turner and his family to read the book , she says : `` If they choose to read it , and really hear it , I will always encourage that . I will always encourage learning and deeper understanding .\n`` But I 've also accepted that what they do is out of my control , that I can only focus on my own trajectory and how I wish to keep moving forward . Mainly , I want the book to exist as a companion .\n`` I think of it as something you can carry with you and you go through difficult things , something you can physically hold or read in bed late at night , when you feel isolated . I always thought like , what would I have needed to hear when I was going through this ? ''\nShe holds a space in her heart for the two Swedish students - Peter Jonsson and Carl-Fredrik Arndt - who stopped the assault , having seen what was happening as they cycled past .\nChanel drew a picture of two bikes and slept with it above her bed after the assault , a talisman to remind her there was hope out there .\nShe 's since met the pair for dinner . `` I always like to say 'be the Swede ' . Show up for the vulnerable , do your part , help each other and face the darkest parts alongside survivors .\n`` I think the response I 've been getting makes it sound like people are willing to step up now and really fight for what 's right . And that 's extremely encouraging . ''\nNow the book is out in the world , Chanel plans to decide what to do with the next phase of her life . But she does so with the hope and belief that the good in the world outweighs the bad .\n`` On the same night I was assaulted , I was also saved , '' she muses . `` There was a really terrible thing that happened - and also a really wonderful thing . They say you should n't meet your heroes - but in this case you definitely should . ''\nAsked what she plans to do now , Chanel says : `` I want to write books for kids , for their ripe brains and juicy hearts , which have not yet learned to be dark and serious and drab .
