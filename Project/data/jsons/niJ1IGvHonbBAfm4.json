John McCain \u2014 who argue the changes would erode key rights of the minority and undermine how the Senate was designed to work . Many of the upstarts have never been in the minority , but veteran Republicans are wary of taking bold action now that could haunt them if they ever lose control of the chamber .\nThe rabble-rousers are targeting the 60-vote threshold to start debate on government spending measures \u2014 a threshold Senate Democrats used to their advantage this year by filibustering all funding bills and ultimately forcing budget negotiations that led to a sweeping fiscal deal last week .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s appropriate to be able to debate a bill without having to have a 60-vote margin , \u201d said Sen. Mike Rounds ( R-S.D. ) . \u201c I think when they originally put the rules in place , it was a mistake not to have made that change in the first place . \u201d\nThe growing push , reflected in interviews with more than a dozen GOP senators , is the latest example of the majority party \u2014 irritated by a filibuster-wielding opposition \u2014 looking at ways to limit minority rights since Senate Democrats activated the so-called nuclear option two years ago to speed the approval of most White House nominations .\nNow , the calls for procedural war are growing louder . Though earlier fights generally centered on nominations , a core group of senators had always been able to strike deals that staved off any major rewrites of the Senate \u2019 s rules \u2014 such as the so-called Gang of 14 senators that reached an agreement on nominees under the Bush administration . Senators had also reached agreements to back down from going nuclear under President Barack Obama .\nBut then Senate Democrats deployed the nuclear option in November 2013 to lower the voting threshold for nearly all nominations . Since then , Republicans have been more willing to openly entertain their own proposals on altering the Senate \u2019 s operations .\nSen. Steve Daines ( R-Mont . ) , a former House member who was elected to the Senate last year , agrees that it \u2019 s time for a change .\n\u201c What it does is it allows us to get these bills on the floor for debate , \u201d Daines said of dumping the 60-vote threshold to bring spending bills to the floor . \u201c The Senate has been referred to as the greatest deliberative body . This would help that deliberative body deliberate more by getting the bills on the floor for debate . \u201d\n\u201c I like the idea of 51 to move . I used to would not , \u201d said Sen. Richard Shelby ( R-Ala. ) , a senior member of the Appropriations Committee . He said the Democrats \u2019 nuclear option two years ago \u201c changed the game , \u201d and added : \u201c You know , it \u2019 s not the law . It \u2019 s not the statute . It \u2019 s not the Constitution . \u201d\nRepublicans are particularly steamed at Democrats for voting to advance appropriations bills through the committee but filibustering them on the floor . The three funding bills that Democrats blocked in the full Senate this year \u2014 defense , military construction and veterans affairs , and energy and water \u2014 all passed the Appropriations Committee with healthy bipartisan majorities .\nThe growing appetite to change the rules also shows how frustration from House GOP lawmakers is having some influence on their Senate-side colleagues .\nA chief complaint from House members is that the Senate \u2014 often paralyzed by a Democratic filibuster \u2014 is unable to move key bills , even though Republicans control both ends of the Capitol . House lawmakers began urging the Senate to nuke the filibuster earlier this year , when the 60-vote threshold prevented the upper chamber from advancing a funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security that would override Obama \u2019 s executive actions on immigration .\n\u201c I \u2019 m actually pretty bullish on changing all the rules as I know them , quite frankly , \u201d said Sen. Tim Scott ( R-S.C. ) , who is also a former House lawmaker . \u201c Nominations , everything \u2026 I \u2019 m open to anything that makes this body actually functioning . \u201d\nThe rising sentiment from GOP senators may have little practical effect , since Senate Republicans broadly believe they would need Democratic buy-in to change the chamber \u2019 s rules . Senate Democrats went nuclear to change the rules two years ago , meaning they did so with a simple majority of 51 votes \u2014 effectively cutting out Republicans , who have since sworn that any rules changes that come under a GOP majority would require 67 votes in the Senate .\nA group assigned by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) is poring through arcane procedural precedent to see what rules changes are possible . Led by GOP Sens . Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Roy Blunt of Missouri , the five senators on that task force want to offer some ideas for rules reforms while ensuring that minority rights are still protected . McConnell himself has said little publicly about his preference on rules changes , except that any alterations should go through regular order , not by going nuclear .\nA Republican aide said the group has met twice , with more discussions to come . And Alexander said he hopes to present potential options for rules changes to the broader GOP Conference \u201c in the next few weeks. \u201d The other GOP senators who are part of the group are Sens . James Lankford of Oklahoma , Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Cory Gardner of Colorado .\nTillis said lowering the threshold for cloture on a motion to proceed on appropriations from 60 to 51 is under consideration as part of those discussions . He , along with several other Senate Republicans , emphasized that the Senate should still require 60 votes to invoke cloture on the back end and advance legislation to final passage .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not the extreme position , \u201d Tillis said of abandoning the initial 60-vote threshold . \u201c This is really , how do you make the process more efficient and what kinds of things can you do to maintain the basic rules of the game but allow us to get a few more plays in ? \u201d\nAdded Sen. Ron Johnson ( R-Wis. ) : \u201c I think that \u2019 s not a bad idea . \u201d\n\u201c Watching how we are not utilizing the process , that could work , \u201d Johnson said . \u201c That \u2019 s an idea certainly worth considering , but only on the motion to proceed . \u201d\nTensions over the legislative filibuster have flared , not just on Capitol Hill this year , but on the 2016 campaign trail as well . A few Republican presidential contenders have called on the Senate to gut the filibuster \u2014 primarily to repeal Obamacare and disapprove Obama \u2019 s nuclear deal with Iran \u2014 although sitting senators running for their respective party nominations generally have declined to go that far .\nThe issue was even slipped into the recent budget negotiations , with McConnell asking Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid whether the Nevada Democrat would agree on a way to ease filibusters on appropriations bills . Reid swiftly objected to the proposal .\n\u201c As I have told Republicans to their faces , if you want to have an appropriations process , then understand the Senate \u2019 s different than the House , \u201d Reid said in a recent interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c I \u2019 m sure [ former Speaker John ] Boehner , I \u2019 m sure [ Speaker Paul ] Ryan , [ House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal ] Rogers obviously , they would love to write rules for the Senate . But we do not want the Senate to be like the House . \u201d\nDespite the rising desire among many Senate Republicans to alter the rules , any changes limiting minority rights are likely to run into resistance from veteran GOP senators who \u2019 ve served in both the majority and minority \u2014 and have seen both the upsides and downsides of the power of the filibuster .\n\u201c I tend to be an institutionalist who really is hesitant to change the rules because I think it usually boomerangs on you , \u201d said Sen.
