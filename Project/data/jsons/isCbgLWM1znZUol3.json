We 'll be fine . ' ''\nThen , Huckabee referenced the Sunday shooting at a church in Texas in which a gunman who killed two people was shot dead by two parishioners on security detail .\n`` It was a machete in the Hanukkah [ attack ] \u2014 and it was a gun that stopped what would have been a horrifically worse murder situation in the church , '' Huckabee said .\n`` So , it 's not the weapons of choice . It 's the lack of heart . The lack of focus in human beings .\n`` When we have an education system that from the time these kids are tots tells them there is nothing that is really right nor wrong \u2014 it 's whatever they think it is , whatever they feel it is , whatever they believe it is \u2014 that results in an adult becoming where they also think they do n't have to tune their lives , '' Huckabee said .\nIn the stabbing outside New York City on Saturday night , Grafton Thomas , 37 , was to appear in federal district court in White Plains later Monday to face five counts of obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs by attempting to kill with a dangerous weapon and causing injuries .\nHe pleaded not guilty Sunday to five counts of attempted murder and one count of burglary .
