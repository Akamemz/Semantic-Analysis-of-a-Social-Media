    "content": "( CNN ) Sen. Bernie Sanders is a staple on the front lines of the labor fight , leading the charge in Washington and around the country to raise the minimum wage for workers to $ 15 an hour . But within his own campaign , which unionized earlier this year , tense discussions over pay have spilled out into public view .\nThe dispute threatens to undermine Sanders ' political message and , if it were to escalate , his ability to credibly advocate for workers around the country currently engaged in their own struggles to negotiate higher wages and better working conditions .\nWord of the discontent first emerged publicly on Thursday night in a Washington Post report detailing campaign field staff 's frustration that their base pay , in some instances , does not match the $ 15-an-hour mandate that Sanders , as a legislator and candidate , has pressed for as the base minimum wage across the country . As the campaign ramps up , field staff are often required to work 10-hour , 6-day weeks , driving down their average hourly compensation .\nIn a statement to the Post , Sanders on Friday defended his campaign salaries and said he was `` very proud '' his presidential campaign was the first to unionize workers .\n`` We have a historic contract agreement that provides unprecedented protections and benefits , '' he said in the statement provided to the Post . `` Through that framework , we are committed to addressing concerns in good faith through the bargaining process . ''\nEarlier Friday , Sanders expressed frustration in an interview with the Des Moines Register that staffers were airing their complaints publicly .\n`` It does bother me that people are going outside of the process and going to the media , '' he told the Iowa newspaper . `` That is really not acceptable . It is really not what labor negotiations are about , and it 's improper . ''\nHe added , `` We are disappointed that some individuals have decided to damage the integrity of these efforts . We are involved in negotiations . And some are individuals that have decided to damage the integrity of that process before they were concluded . ''\nA source told CNN that campaign officials were in a room with representatives from the union , discussing the topic , when the campaign was first made aware of the Post 's story .\nIn a statement to CNN , Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said that the campaign offered the field staff a boost in pay that would guarantee a $ 15 an hour salary commensurate with a 60-hour work week . That proposal , according to Shakir , was rejected by the membership .\n`` As strong supporters of organized labor , this formal process is the sole process for making changes to the collective bargaining agreement . It would be anti-union , and likely illegal , for the campaign to negotiate outside this process , '' Shakir said . `` We look forward to continuing those discussions and obviously are disappointed that some individuals decided to damage the integrity of these efforts before they were concluded . ''\nAs the negotiations continue , Shakir said he would be limiting the work week for field staff to only 40 hours a week .\nJonathan Williams , a spokesperson for the UFCW Local 400 would not comment on the specifics of the negotiations , but in a statement the union said it would continue working with the campaign to sort out the ongoing concerns .\n`` First and foremost , our union is a democratic organization . We can not comment on specific , ongoing internal processes between our members and their employer , particularly without the consent of our members , '' the union said . `` We can say that our union is proud to advocate for every member in every workplace we represent to earn a better life -- both during contract negotiations and beyond . ''\nThe leaked details from the negotiations and internal messaging within the campaign came at a particularly uncomfortable time for Sanders , who had only hours earlier praised the House Democrats for their historic vote to pass of the Raise the Wage Act of 2019 , which would raise the federal minimum wage to $ 15 an hour .\n`` Four years ago , when I first introduced legislation to increase the minimum wage to $ 15 an hour , it was considered an impossible dream , '' Sanders said in a statement on Thursday . `` Today , I am proud to say that a $ 15 minimum wage has gone from laughable to inevitable . ''\nIts fate within his own campaign , though , remains unresolved . Campaign work hours are notoriously hard to plan out and predict , which is one of the reasons three current presidential hopefuls ' staffs -- including Sen.
