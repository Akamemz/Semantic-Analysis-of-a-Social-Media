Declaring that `` America is coming to help , '' he also said that the U.S. decided to conduct the drops to the 50,000 or so religious minorities stranded on a mountaintop in the country 's north , who have been forced to flee their homes as the militants advanced .\nObama said the religious minorities are under the threat of genocide from militants from the Islamic State ( IS ) , the group formerly known as ISIS , and are stranded on the mountain without food or water .
