    "content": "Facing mounting outrage in the media over its new \u201c zero-tolerance \u201d policy at the border , the Trump administration is deliberately misleading Americans about the thousands of migrant children it has forcibly separated from their families . The objective , according to people close to Donald Trump , is twofold : \u201c deterrence , \u201d as Chief of Staff John Kelly explained last month , and political extortion . \u201c The thinking in the building is to force people to the table , \u201d a White House official told The Washington Post last week . A second official confirmed that the president is hoping to use the detained children as leverage to force Democrats to cut a deal on immigration : \u201c If they aren \u2019 t going to cooperate , we are going to look to utilize the laws as hard as we can . \u201d\nThe images emerging from these detention centers , where traumatized young children are kept in chain-link pens , have drawn comparisons to some of the worst episodes in American history , including the internment of Japanese Americans during WWII . Instead of ending the controversial policy , however , President Trump has promoted a contradictory and confusing message about family separation . At times , he has blamed Democrats for what he has described as their \u201c law \u201d ( it is not a law ) ; at others , he has suggested that family separation is indeed his policy , but that Democrats have forced him to take action by not agreeing to new immigration-reform legislation . In a series of tweets Monday morning , he wrote that it is \u201c the Democrats fault for being weak and ineffective with Boarder [ sic ] Security and Crime \u201d and called on Congress to \u201c change the laws. \u201d He also indicated that the policy is driven by racial or cultural concerns , describing migrant children as Trojan horses for \u201c the worst criminals on earth \u201d and declaring that the U.S. should not repeat Europe \u2019 s \u201c big mistake \u201d of \u201c allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture . \u201d\nOver the weekend and into Monday , a number of Trump officials made similar obfuscations about the policy . In every instance , however , the implication was clear : the problem could go away if Democrats will just play ball . \u201c This is up to the Democrats . They could fix this right now . If you close those loopholes , we could do this humanely , \u201d White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley said during an interview with Fox & Friends on Monday , before accusing Democrats of bolstering drug cartels and the \u201c child-smuggling industry. \u201d Senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway similarly put the onus on Congress to address the crisis at the border during an interview with NBC \u2019 s Meet the Press on Sunday .
