    "content": "As ethics counsel to the current president and his predecessor , we scrutinized their tax returns before they were released every year . We also worked with our colleagues to review many tax returns of presidential nominees for cabinet and other positions . Based on the few pages of Donald J. Trump \u2019 s 1995 tax returns that have become public , we have come to the conclusion that no one in his position would have been nominated , much less confirmed by the Senate , during either of the administrations we served . The same is true of any modern administration of a president from either party .\nIf a presidential candidate can not meet that standard , then we question his qualifications for the highest office in the land .\nIn both the Bush and Obama administrations , a bad attitude about paying taxes was a deal killer . Both of us saw instances of nominations that were doomed by the arguably legal but unsavory use of tax loopholes , as well as by the failure to pay Social Security taxes , the taking of excessive deductions for home offices or the sidestepping of sales taxes on out-of-state purchases . Explaining to the Senate and to the American people how a billionaire could have a $ 916 million \u201c loss carry-forward \u201d that potentially allowed him to not pay taxes for over a decade , perhaps for as long as 18 years , would have been far too difficult for the White House when many hard-working Americans turn a third or more of their earnings over to the government .\nAny nominee who had told either of us that he had a \u201c fiduciary responsibility \u201d as a businessman or to his family to pay as little tax as possible , as Mr. Trump put it , would have been told to stop wasting the president \u2019 s time . People who believe they have a legal duty to put self-interest before the public interest don \u2019 t belong in public service . Besides , these are personal tax returns we are talking about . There is no such thing as a \u201c fiduciary duty \u201d as a businessman to oneself . That , as we \u2019 ve said before , is called greed .",
