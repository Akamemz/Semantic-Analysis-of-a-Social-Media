    "content": "Free speech is a value , not a right . Understanding this distinction sheds light on the various debates in the culture war\u2014who social media platforms should ban , the role of the First Amendment , and cancel culture . It \u2019 s true that companies like Twitter and Facebook have the moral right to allow whoever they like on their platforms . In that sense , customers do not have some immutable right to say whatever they please , but instead must conform to the companies \u2019 rules or risk banishment . The same holds for a suburban dinner party\u2014the host owns the house and so determines the rules of engagement for guests . In general , it is the owner of the property who decides what is and is not acceptable speech there .\nEven the First Amendment of the United States \u2019 Constitution does not really grant its citizens a right to free speech . The Amendment is more about constraining government encroachment rather than allowing Americans to speak their mind in all places and at all times . \u201c Congress shall make no law\u2026 abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press\u2026 \u201d reads the text , and it \u2019 s certainly important to shackling the Leviathan . The First Amendment does not bestow a right to free speech , it prevents government from passing legislation criminalizing it . We are all still subject to the speech codes , cultural norms , and rules of conduct set forth by the owner of any shop , restaurant , hotel , company headquarters , and web platform that we wish to use . There is far more to society than government .\nPrivate property rights define who is morally permitted to employ particular resources to their ends . This captures the intuition that you own your body and therefore have the right to \u201c employ \u201d it to whatever end you desire , so long as you do not violate someone else \u2019 s right to do the same . This logic extends outwards to any physical resource that we might appropriate . We need a notion of private property rights because resources are scarce\u2014not everyone can inhabit the same parcel of land simultaneously , nor eat the same apple , nor take the same cab . The system of private property rights , which we already live by in our daily lives , is how we \u2019 ve solved the problem of dealing with a world of individual ends and finite resources .\nFree speech is subordinate to the private property rights of whatever resources are needed to speak in the first place . For example , the owner of Twitter has the moral right to determine what can be said on his platform . Similarly , the owner of a theater has the right to rent out his property to only scientists , if he so chooses . He also has the moral right to reject proposals by , say , pastors to rent his theater . In The Ethics of Liberty , economist Murray Rothbard summarizes : \u201c Take\u2026 the \u2018 human right \u2019 of free speech . Freedom of speech is supposed to mean the right of everyone to say whatever he likes . But the neglected question is : where ? Where does a man have this right ? He certainly does not have it on property on which he is trespassing . In short , he has this right only either on his own property or on the property of someone who has agreed\u2026 to allow him on the premises . In fact , then , there is no such thing as a separate \u2018 right to free speech \u2019 ; there is only a man \u2019 s property right : the right to do as he wills with his own or to make voluntary agreements with other property owners . \u201d\nCivilization is about more than rights . It is also defined by our culture\u2014what we value , what we pursue , and how we treat dissidents , eccentrics , and other thinkers who fall outside the Overton window . Should we shame them into silence , or pretend they don \u2019 t exist , or hope that they are banned from various platforms ? While we have the right to wish for their social exile , we should not do so . A culture that rejects free expression as a value is a culture without a reliable mechanism for error-correction . We can never be certain about anything , nor can we ever predict arguments that haven \u2019 t yet been conceived , written , or uttered . Arbitrary restrictions on what can be said about some topic presumes that the matter is forever settled .\nThe government can not legislate cultural change . American politicians grew hip to same-sex marriage in the mid-2010s only after polls indicated that the people approved . Conversely , the war on drugs , begun by President Richard Nixon in 1971 , has been a disaster by any metric in the nearly 50 years since its inception . It has failed in part because people continued to use drugs in defiance of the government \u2019 s laws . No amount of top-down legislation will improve the current status of free speech in the Western world , precarious though it may be . It is up to us to take free speech seriously , and to create a culture that cherishes it from the bottom-up .\nThe philosopher John Stuart Mill understood the distinction between government and culture , and the relationship between both and free speech . His 1859 book On Liberty , offers a superb defense of a culture that values open-ended discussion . That governments should not jail individuals for their words is easily understood , and even those who want people banned or bullied for their views might agree with that . But restraints on governments are not enough , and Mill understood that what he called the \u201c tyranny of the majority \u201d could suppress individuals with minority opinions : \u201c when society is itself the tyrant\u2014society collectively , over the separate individuals who compose it\u2014its means of tyrannizing are not restricted to the acts which it may do by the hands of its political functionaries . \u201d\nTo those who wish to shame , silence , or otherwise suppress uncomfortable , unpalatable , or offensive ideas , what is our argument ? First , as Mill points out , even those confident that their opinions are correct will benefit from hearing a novel counterargument . They will come to understand their own position more clearly . If an idea that has been accepted as truth never has to be defended , it will become what Mill called \u201c dead dogma. \u201d An idea no one is permitted to question , even if true , may as well be superstition .
