    "content": "A small injury to a nerve outside the brain and spinal cord is relatively easy to repair just by stretching it , but a major gap in such a peripheral nerve poses problems . Usually , another nerve is taken from elsewhere in the body , and it causes an extra injury and returns only limited movement .\nNow researchers at the University of Pittsburgh have found an effective way to bridge such a gap\u2014at least in mice and monkeys\u2014by inserting a biodegradable tube that releases a protein called a growth factor for several months .
