As white lives , '' on June 23 , sparking backlash from students , alumni , and even Twitter , which removed the professor 's tweet . Students created a Change.org petition calling on Cambridge to fire the professor for her remarks . The petition garnered more than 20,000 signatures but was removed by the website\u2014which has often served as a major driver for targeting people who are tied to viral controversies . A Change.org spokesman claimed the petition was a form of `` bullying '' because it singled out Gopal .\n`` This petition was removed for being in breach of our bullying and harassment policy , '' the spokesman said .\nThe spokesman declined to say whether the site plans to erase other petitions that attempt to get others fired .\nDespite the controversy , Gopal doubled down on her remarks in an interview with the \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\n`` I would also like to make clear I stand by my tweets , now deleted by Twitter , not me , '' Gopal said . `` They were very clearly speaking to a structure and ideology , not about people . My Tweet said whiteness is not special , not a criterion for making lives matter . I stand by that . ''\nThe day after Gopal 's tweet , Cambridge issued a statement claiming the university `` defends the right of its academics to express their own lawful opinions '' but has not commented further on Gopal 's tweet or the professor 's employment status . The university did not respond to a request for comment . Gopal told the Free Beacon she does not believe she will be terminated given her right to freedom of speech .\n`` I do n't think [ my employment ] is in question at this point as my employer is clear and has said publicly that they stand by my right to freedom of speech within the law . My tweet did not violate the law in any way as the police have also publicly stated , '' Gopal said . `` My aim was to get us to think and debate about the difference between White Lives Matter and Black Lives Matter . They are not the same thing at this historical moment . ''\nObservers of the controversy believe there is a double standard for professors who hold left-leaning views compared with speakers , activists , and professors who hold right-leaning views . Emma Webb , a scholar at the London think tank Civitas , told the Free Beacon that Gopal 's continued employment would not fly had she targeted another group .\n`` I do not agree with firing people because they hold certain opinions , the problem is the evident double standard . Cambridge University has had no qualms in the past firing people \u2026 the difference was simply that they were conservative academics , '' Webb said . `` In the United Kingdom , it is increasingly common for people to lose their jobs for expressing \u2018 heretical ' opinions . But left-wing academics appear to be immune from this threat , no matter how horrifying or hateful their statements are . ''\nIn 2019 , Cambridge fired conservative scholar Noah Carl after 500 activist colleagues signed a letter dubbing his research `` racist pseudoscience '' and calling on the university to fire him . The university also rescinded a visiting fellowship offer to Dr. Jordan Peterson , a conservative Canadian scholar , after activists complained about his stance on political correctness .\nGopal reiterated that she would repost her tweet in comments to the Free Beacon .\n`` I simply mean that whiteness could not be the basis for lives mattering so we could not be saying \u2018 white lives matter ' as though it was the same as devalued black lives mattering , '' Gopal said . `` White lives are already valued where black lives are not . Please note that the immediate context for my tweet was a response to a plane being hired to fly a \u2018 White Lives Matter ' banner . ''\nGopal 's anti-white statements predate the anti-police protests that have rocked the country since the death of George Floyd at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer . In February 2019 , Gopal wrote , `` I resist urges to kneecap white men every day . So , no I am the hero .
