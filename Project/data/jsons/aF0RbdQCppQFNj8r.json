I argued that it was n't sufficiently significant to serve as the basis for any claim that Trump is in the clear , as `` subjects '' can turn into `` targets '' rather quickly ; it was , however , significant enough to perhaps suggest that the Special Counsel probe was winding down and may not produce any blockbusters . Then came Monday 's bombshell events , which Katie wrote about here .

There's a fascinating theme throughout it: when you're living a historical event, how do you know? How can you tell when a development is a Big Deal? This is a big deal. It's very early on, but here's some things we can already tell...it's not just that the office thought that there was enough for a search warrant. They thought there was enough for a search warrant of an attorney's office for that attorney's client communications. That's a very fraught and extraordinary move that requires multiple levels of authorization within the Department of Justice... - The feds are only supposed to raid a law firm if less intrusive measures won't work. - Such a search requires high-level approval. The USAM requires such a search warrant to be approved by the U.S. Attorney \u2014 the head of the office, a Presidential appointee [my note: a Trump appointee] \u2014 and requires \"consultation\" with the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. - Such a search requires an elaborate review process. The basic rule is that the government may not deliberately seize, or review, attorney-client communications. The USAM \u2014 and relevant caselaw \u2014 therefore require the feds to set up a review process. - A Magistrate Judge signed off on this. Federal magistrate judges (appointed by local district judges, not by the President) review search warrant applications. A Magistrate Judge therefore reviewed this application and found probable cause \u2014 that is, probable cause to believe that the subject premises (Cohen's office) contains specified evidence of a specified federal crime.\n\nThat's just an excerpt from a longer piece, the link to which crashed intermittently yesterday afternoon and evening due to overwhelming interest and heavy traffic.
