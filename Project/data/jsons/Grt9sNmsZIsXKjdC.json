    "content": "( CNN ) An unapologetic Joe Biden defended his remarks about working with segregationist senators on Wednesday , telling reporters that `` there 's not a racist bone in my body . ''\n`` Apologize for what ? '' Biden told CNN when asked about Booker 's call outside a fundraiser Wednesday evening in Rockville , Maryland .\n`` Cory should apologize , '' he said . `` He knows better . There 's not a racist bone in my body . I 've been involved in civil rights my whole career . ''\nBiden 's brief remarks were his first comments following a controversy that erupted after he pointed to two late segregationist senators as examples of colleagues he could work with during an era where `` at least there was some civility '' in the Senate .\nAt the fundraiser Tuesday , Biden recalled being a member of the Senate in the 1970s with Southern Democrats who opposed civil rights and desegregation . He specifically named Sens . James Eastland of Mississippi and Herman Talmadge of Georgia , who Biden called `` one of the meanest guys I ever knew . ''\n`` I was in a caucus with James O. Eastland . He never called me 'boy , ' he always called me 'son , ' `` Biden told donors .\n`` Well , guess what ? At least there was some civility . We got things done . We did n't agree on much of anything . We got things done . We got it finished , '' Biden said . `` But today , you look at the other side and you 're the enemy . Not the opposition , the enemy . We do n't talk to each other anymore . ''\nSpeaking to reporters on Wednesday evening , Biden said he `` could not have disagreed with Jim Eastland more '' and that he `` ran for the United States Senate because I disagreed with the views of the segregationists -- there were many of them in the Senate at the time . ''\n`` The point I 'm making is you do n't have to agree . You do n't have to like the people in terms of their views , but you just simply make the case and you beat them . You beat them without changing the system , '' he said .\nBooker shot back in an interview with Don Lemon on `` CNN Tonight '' later Wednesday evening .\n`` I was raised to speak truth to power , '' Booker said . `` And that I will never apologize for doing that and Vice President Biden should n't need this lesson . ''\n`` Somebody running for president of the United States , somebody running to be the leader of our party , should know that using the word 'boy ' in the way he did can cause hurt and pain . We need a presidential nominee and leader of our party to be sensitive to that , '' Booker added .\nAt a fundraiser Wednesday night , Biden brought up Eastland and Talmadge again -- but this time did not tout the civility of the era in which the two Southern segregationists were his Senate colleagues .\nInstead , Biden pointed to the late Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy , a progressive icon , helping him land a spot on the Senate Judiciary Committee .\n`` And we had to put up with the likes of like Jim Eastland and Hermy Talmadge and all those segregationists and all of that . And the fact of the matter is that we were able to do it because we were able to win -- we were able to beat them on everything they stood for , '' Biden said . `` We in fact detested what they stood for in terms of segregation and all the rest . ''\n`` You do n't joke about calling black men 'boys . ' Men like James O. Eastland used words like that , and the racist policies that accompanied them , to perpetuate white supremacy and strip black Americans of our very humanity , '' Booker said in a statement .\n`` Vice President Biden 's relationships with proud segregationists are not the model for how we make America a safer and more inclusive place for black people , and for everyone . I have to tell Vice President Biden , as someone I respect , that he is wrong for using his relationships with Eastland and Talmadge as examples of how to bring our country together , '' he added . `` And frankly , I 'm disappointed that he has n't issued an immediate apology for the pain his words are dredging up for many Americans . He should . ''\n`` To coddle the reputations of segregationists , of people who if they had their way I would literally not be standing here as a member of the United States Senate , is -- I think it 's just it 's misinformed , '' Sen. Kamala Harris told reporters .\n`` To suggest that individuals who literally made it their life 's work to take America back on the issue of race is a real problem for me , '' the California Democrat said .\n`` I 'm not here to criticize other Democrats , but it 's never OK to celebrate segregationists . Never , '' said Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts .\nFormer Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas said in an interview with `` Pod Save America '' that Biden 's remarks were not a good example of the civility the former vice president was calling for .\n`` For the vice president to somehow say that what we 're seeing in this country today is a function of partisanship , or a lack of bipartisanship , completely ignores ... the legacy of slavery and the act of suppression of African Americans and communities of color right now , '' O'Rourke said .",
