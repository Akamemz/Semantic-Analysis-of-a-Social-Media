They say it favors big producers and has made the system less resilient and flexible in a crisis .\nIf the U.S. Army hadn \u2019 t served rotten beef when Teddy Roosevelt fought in the Spanish-American War , perhaps he wouldn \u2019 t have pressed Congress to pass the 1906 Meat Inspection Act \u2013 a law that has made U.S. meat one of the most trusted brands in the world .\nWhen the \u201c most hated man in Washington \u201d suddenly gains 20 new co-sponsors for his bill , it must signal a pressing need . And among the countless problems created or exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic , perhaps one of the most urgent has been the strain on America \u2019 s meat supply chain .\nWith dozens of meat plants temporarily shut down , farmers across the country have had to euthanize tens of thousands of animals , and face the wrenching prospect of far larger culling . Meanwhile , U.S. weekly red meat production has dropped by as much as 34.9 % compared with last year , causing prices to surge and grocery store shelves to lie empty .\nThe crisis has lately prompted nearly two dozen lawmakers to add their names to legislation put forward by Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky , an MIT-educated Republican who owns 63 cattle and became persona non grata among his colleagues in the early weeks of the pandemic after he forced them all to come back to the nation \u2019 s capital for a key vote .\nFive years ago , he and Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine first introduced the PRIME Act , designed to create more flexibility and resiliency in the meat supply system . The bill would allow smaller meat producers to utilize local butchers and sell their products directly to consumers , restaurants , and grocery stores , rather than getting funneled through USDA-inspected facilities and the handful of corporations that make up 80 % of America \u2019 s meat market .\n\u201c What you \u2019 re seeing right now is not the result of an efficient capitalist system , \u201d says Representative Massie , who faults U.S. regulations for creating a \u201c monopoly \u201d of big meat companies . He says removing some of the red tape will enable their competition to flourish , paving the way for shuttered or new local butchers to open and existing ones to expand to meet growing consumer demand for locally raised meat .\nThe bill , which now has 42 co-sponsors from libertarians to progressives , is one of a growing number of alternative models to industrial meat production that have been gaining traction in recent years , driven by everything from animal welfare and \u201c eat local \u201d movements to constitutional concerns about federal overreach . Now , COVID-19 \u2019 s intense strain on the supply chain is generating wider interest in rethinking the system . Representative Massie admits the bill \u2019 s chances at passing were slim five years ago , but says they have \u201c increased exponentially \u201d this month as consumers learn more about how the food supply pipeline works . \u201c Because the people are now interested , the congressmen are getting interested , \u201d he says .\nStill , it \u2019 s unclear how much such initiatives would alleviate the current bottlenecks , with many local butchers already booked into 2021 and freezer space largely maxed out . And while federal inspection is undoubtedly more burdensome for smaller producers and processors , it \u2019 s just one aspect of a larger equation involving economies of scale . Above all , America has spent years building a sterling reputation for meat safety among its trade partners \u2013 and some say it would be shortsighted to undermine in any way the federal oversight on which that trust is founded .\n\u201c Am I in favor of less red tape that would add flexibility to the supply chain ? Yes , \u201d says Glynn Tonsor , a professor of agricultural economics at Kansas State University in Manhattan , Kansas . He says the PRIME Act would help , but cautions , \u201c It \u2019 s not a magic bullet . \u201d\nIf the U.S. Army hadn \u2019 t served rotten beef to Teddy Roosevelt when he was a colonel in the Spanish-American War , perhaps he wouldn \u2019 t have pressed as hard for Congress to pass the Meat Inspection Act during his presidency .\nThe rotten beef scandal precipitated a series of hearings on meat safety , federal inspection practices ( or lack thereof ) , and unsanitary conditions in meatpacking plants , further exposed in Upton Sinclair \u2019 s 1906 novel \u201c The Jungle . \u201d\nSinclair , who sought to spark a socialist movement in support of plant workers , instead galvanized public demands for increased government regulation to ensure meat safety . \u201c I aimed at the public \u2019 s heart , \u201d he wrote , \u201c and by accident I hit it in the stomach . \u201d\nRoosevelt , after sending investigators to the packinghouses to verify Sinclair \u2019 s depiction , used the ensuing report to push the stalled Meat Inspection Act through Congress in 1906 .\nUnder that law , all meat sold across state lines must be processed in a USDA-inspected facility , where an inspector is on hand at all times to examine livestock , ensure humane slaughtering practices , and observe the processing of meat . Meat for sale within a state can be processed at a state-inspected facility , provided its standards are at least as stringent as the U.S. Department of Agriculture \u2019 s . Currently , the only exemption to that inspection regime is for owners of livestock who get meat processed at custom processors for their own consumption , or to share with family , employees , and nonpaying guests .\nWith a limited number of USDA-inspected facilities , smaller producers often have to drive their livestock hundreds of miles to get their meat processed , adding substantially to the cost and running the risk that their product could be mingled with industrially produced meat .\nThis spring , Wyoming passed a pioneering law that would allow ranchers to sell meat to their neighbors \u2013 while the cattle are still alive . By buying shares in a herd , customers would be considered \u201c owners \u201d at the time of slaughter and thus allowed to consume the meat without inspection by the USDA .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think [ the USDA is ] this nefarious organization plotting in the deep state or trying to prevent grandmothers from buying T-bone steaks from their next-door neighbors , \u201d says state Rep. Tyler Lindholm , who spearheaded the bill . But , he adds , citing the 10th Amendment of the Constitution , \u201c What authority do you have to tell Wyoming citizens that [ they ] can \u2019 t sell steak to each other ? \u201d\nThe PRIME Act , short for Processing Revival and Intrastate Meat Exemption , seeks to go one step further than Wyoming \u2019 s law by giving states the option of permitting custom-slaughtered meat to be sold not only to individual consumers but also to restaurants , grocery stores , and other outlets within their borders .\nIntroduced in May 2019 for the third time in four years , the bill has yet to move forward . In a May 14 letter , Representative Pingree urged Speaker Nancy Pelosi to take up the bill in response to the current processing and supply shortages .\n\u201c I am not advocating for relaxing the standards that the USDA has set , \u201d wrote the Maine congresswoman , an organic farmer who raises vegetables , pigs , and chickens . \u201c I am simply asking that we address the needs of communities in a way that supports them both economically and morally during this unprecedented time , by allowing America \u2019 s family farms to do what they do best \u2013 feed their neighbors . \u201d\nStill , many in the meat industry caution against such a move .\nColin Woodall , CEO of the National Cattlemen \u2019 s Beef Association , says the association opposes the PRIME Act because of how it could undermine years of investment in making USDA-inspected meat the \u201c gold standard \u201d around the globe . \u201c If there is a food safety issue that breaks out ... that \u2019 s not going to be the problem of Johnny \u2019 s local [ meat ] locker ; that \u2019 s a beef industry problem , \u201d he says .\nA central aspect of the debate is about who is responsible for ensuring safety . Advocates of less regulation say that greater transparency in packaging , such as where meat was raised and processed , could give consumers the opportunity to make informed decisions about the food they \u2019 re purchasing , rather than depending solely on the government .\n\u201c Our founders never intended government to be so ingrained in our life that it became ... the preserver of safety , \u201d says Ben Adams , a Marine running for the Idaho state legislature as a Republican , who has been in touch with state Representative Lindholm about using Wyoming \u2019 s new law as a model for his state .\nCritics of federal regulations also call into question aspects of USDA inspection they see as excessive \u2013 such as a requirement that all USDA inspectors be furnished with an office and a bathroom for their exclusive use . Many also see the current rules as arbitrary .\n\u201c Right now , I could step out on my deck and butcher 1,000 chickens on my deck ... and I could sell those directly to consumers without any inspection , labeling , or licensing . But I can \u2019 t sell one T-bone steak , \u201d says state Representative Lindholm in Wyoming . \u201c It \u2019 s not actually about safety anymore ; it \u2019 s about protecting a monopoly . \u201d\nOthers say only the federal government is in a position to guarantee consistency of standards and comprehensive oversight , both of which are key for trade relationships .\nDarci Vetter , who grew up eating uninspected meat on her family farm in Nebraska and served as chief agricultural negotiator for the U.S. trade representative under President Barack Obama , says it \u2019 s vital not to put exports at risk . As of 2017 , the United States exported nearly 13 % of the beef and 27 % of the pork it produced , with market development activities in more than 80 countries .\n\u201c From a former trade negotiator perspective , what we don \u2019 t want is for a major destination for U.S. meat to say , \u2018 Hey , wait a minute , ... How do I know if the rules are actually being followed ? \u2019 \u201d says Ms. Vetter , now the vice chair for food and agriculture at Edelman North America .\nThe 2003 outbreak of BSE ( popularly referred to as mad cow disease ) in the U.S. prompted nearly all international markets to stop accepting American beef , incurring losses of $ 16 billion over a decade . \u201c It \u2019 s 17 years later , and we can still feel the effects from those markets being closed to us . You can understand the hesitation , \u201d she says .\nIn addition , the World Trade Organization prohibits member nations from creating preferential markets for domestic products . If local producers are seen as gaining an advantage over foreign exporters of meat to the U.S. , such as being exempted from the cost of USDA inspection , that could run afoul of WTO rules .\nSome cattlemen say the system is stacked against them . But Trent Loos , a sixth-generation farmer in Nebraska and radio show host with a wide following out West , says that while deep-pocketed corporations have a greater ability to hire lobbyists , he doesn \u2019 t buy the idea that American cattlemen are disadvantaged .\n\u201c I just think we \u2019 re not loud enough . I think we got ta get louder , \u201d says Mr. Loos , before meeting with a Nebraska state senator interested in Wyoming \u2019 s model .\nEven under the current USDA inspection regime , some local meat markets are finding ways to thrive . Walden Meat , which delivers locally raised meat to customers across New England and New York , has seen a tenfold increase in the rate of new customer sign-ups over the past couple of months .\nThey co-own and operate a regional slaughterhouse in Vermont , and everything they sell is USDA-inspected , which CEO Charley Cummings says lends their product a certain credibility .\n\u201c We really value the USDA as a partner in that regard , and see them as playing a really important role in establishing universal standards , \u201d he says . \u201c We have not found it overly constraining to the viability of a farm-to-consumer business. \u201d He notes , however , that such a model wouldn \u2019 t be workable in a less densely populated area like Wyoming .\nMr. Cummings says Walden Meat , which aims to price its products at 10 % to 15 % less than Whole Foods , delivers 55 cents to farmers and butchers per dollar of meat sold , compared with 10 to 11 cents in the commodity world .\n\u201c We \u2019 re all for everything that delivers more dollars to farmers \u2019 pockets , \u201d he says . \u201c What this crisis has laid bare is that we have prioritized efficiency in meat production above all else \u2013 animal welfare , environment , farmers , processors , and employees in every step of that value chain . \u201d\nAs customers have increasingly sought local meat , whether out of animal welfare concerns or nutritional considerations , they have found creative ways to work within the USDA law \u2013 such as going in with a friend on a pig or a cow before it \u2019 s slaughtered , and then splitting the meat . Wyoming \u2019 s state Representative Lindholm has made that somewhat easier with his herd share law , which allows an unlimited number of people to \u201c own \u201d the animal .\nBut Representative Massie says such workarounds are cumbersome . Plus , he says , the USDA exemption is regressive ; not everyone has $ 1,000 or the necessary freezer space . He argues there \u2019 s an untapped potential for local producers to make a far greater contribution , and bring local meat within the reach of average Americans .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox .
