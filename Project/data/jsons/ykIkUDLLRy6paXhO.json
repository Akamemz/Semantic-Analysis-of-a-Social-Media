''\n`` On the other hand , in terms of immediate threats to the United States , ISIL , Khorasan Group -- those folks could kill Americans , '' he said .\nThe Islamic State group , also known as ISIS or ISIL , has taken control of large sections of Iraq and Syria . The Khorasan Group is a cell of militants that the U.S. says is plotting attacks against the West in cooperation with the Nusra front , Syria 's Al Qaeda affiliate .\nBoth groups have been targeted by U.S. airstrikes in recent days ; together they constitute the most significant military opposition to Assad . Obama said his first priority is degrading the extremists who are threatening Iraq and the West .

''\nIn discussing Iraq , Obama said the U.S. left the country after the war with \u201c a democracy that was intact , a military that was well-equipped and the ability then ( for Iraqis ) to chart their own course . \u201d\nHowever , Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki \u201c squandered \u201d that opportunity over roughly five years because he was \u201c much more interested in consolidating his Shia base and very suspicious of the Sunnis and the Kurds , who make up the other two thirds of the country , \u201d the president said .\nObama said military force is necessary to shrink the Islamic State \u2019 s capacity , cut off financing and eliminate the flow of foreign fighters .

Boehner said on ABC 's `` This Week '' that the U.S. may have `` no choice '' but to send in American troops if the mix of U.S.-led airstrikes and a ground campaign reliant on Iraqi forces , Kurdish fighters and moderate Syrian rebels fails to achieve that goal .\n`` These are barbarians .
