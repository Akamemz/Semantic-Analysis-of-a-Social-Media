    "content": "If you find it difficult to grasp how a handful of leftwing extremists managed to win last week \u2019 s battle with the nominal leadership of the Democratic Party over a House resolution originally written to condemn anti-Semitism , Margaret Thatcher explained the phenomenon four decades ago : \u201c The one thing about leftwing politicians is that they are always fanatical . They never let go . It \u2019 s their religion. \u201d She was describing how the Labour Party had been destroyed from within by a small minority of radicals . Thatcher eventually exploited this process , led the Conservative Party to victory over Labour , and became Prime Minister for eleven years .\nThe Republicans will deliver a similarly humiliating defeat to House Democrats in 2020 if its alleged leaders fail to rein in their own cadre of fanatical leftists , the core of which consists of recently elected social justice warriors Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , Ilhan Omar , Rashida Tlaib , Ayanna Pressley , Rohit Khanna , Raul Grijalva , and Pramila Jayapal . But the internecine fight that preceded the cowardly revision of the anti-Semitism resolution into a denunciation of generic bigotry suggests that Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Steny Hoyer may not hold enough sway over their own caucus to prevent it from self-destructing .\nBefore their epic defeat in 1994 , the Democrats held the House majority for no fewer than four decades . Yet , after 12 years in the wilderness , they clearly had learned nothing . After finally winning it back again in 2006 , their irresponsible antics condemned them to the minority after only four years . If they pursue their current agenda for the next 18 months , they will be in the minority again after only two years . Not only can they not muster a majority to condemn anti-Semitism , their most visible members are unabashedly embracing socialism , and the first piece of major legislation , H.R.1 , literally gives illegal immigrants the vote .\nThe Democrat majority jammed that bill , ironically titled \u201c For the People Act of 2019 , \u201d through last Friday . At a time when the voters say immigration is the most important issue facing the nation , this pernicious bill actually loosens restrictions on voting by illegal aliens . The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 ( theoretically ) prohibits noncitizens from voting in federal elections , but H.R.1 permits them to vote in local contests such as school board elections . The GOP attempted to amend the bill so that only U.S. citizens can vote . The Democrats rejected this , of course , as Rep. Dan Crenshaw ( R-TX ) tweeted :\nToday I offered a motion to recommit # HR1 reaffirming that only US citizens should have the right to vote . Dems rejected it .

It would vitiate the accuracy of registration rolls by automatically registering anyone who acquires a driver \u2019 s license , prevent election officials from verifying voter eligibility , and render state voter ID laws null and void . H.R.1 also takes the power to draw congressional districts away from the states , and requires inclusion of illegal aliens in all redistricting plans .

Dubbed \u201c Medicare for All , \u201d it will eliminate all private and employer health plans , and come with an annual price tag of $ 3.3 trillion .
