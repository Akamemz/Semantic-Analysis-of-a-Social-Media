They do n't do banking , so they do n't need a license from a bank regulator . They do n't underwrite securities , so they do n't warrant scrutiny from market regulators . And they are n't open to the mass public , so they evade consumer protection regulation too .\nOne big goal of post-crisis financial regulation was to create a council of all the different regulators \u2014 the Financial Stability Oversight Council \u2014 to make sure that individual regulators ' focus on the trees does n't lead them to miss a forest of potential disaster . That 's why FSOC decided to look at hedge funds , and its initial findings suggest a big possible problem in hedge land .\nOr , rather , two different and related problems . One is that an excessively indebted hedge fund could go bust , leading to problems at the institutions that loaned it money . The other is that a large hedge fund could be forced into a \u201c fire sale \u201d of the assets it owns . In either case , the fund itself going bust wouldn \u2019 t necessarily be a problem for the economy , but the ripple effects it causes might be .\nThanks to new regulations put in place in the wake of the 2007- \u2019 08 financial crisis , regulators are now able to see the outlines of where trouble might arise .

The fund at issue , Long-Term Capital Management , had made some big debt-financed bets that went badly awry primarily as a result of Russia defaulting on its national debt in August 1998 .\nThis was an embarrassing failure for some of the hottest names on Wall Street , but also a potentially catastrophic situation for a wider range of economic actors . A number of East Asian countries had entered a financial crisis situation the previous year , and the Russian default had markets across the board jittery .

So we got a politically ambitious regulatory overhaul that did not specifically target hedge funds .
