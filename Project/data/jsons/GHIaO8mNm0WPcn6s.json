Jeb Bush 's tax problem\nThe former Florida governor has said he could accept tax increases in a hypothetical deficit-cutting deal . Never mind that he added that would come only in exchange for major federal spending cuts , or that he repeatedly cut taxes as governor .\nTax hikes are still apostasy in Republican circles , and the stance could be a big problem for Bush if he decides to seek the party \u2019 s presidential nomination in 2016 .\nBush \u2019 s views are already pitting him against one of his party \u2019 s most influential activists , Grover Norquist , the high priest of anti-tax orthodoxy who \u2019 s convinced nearly every elected Republican to sign a pledge not to raise taxes .\nIt \u2019 s the very issue that helped bring down Bush \u2019 s father , former President George H.W . Bush , who lost his bid for a second term after famously reneging on a \u201c no new taxes \u201d pledge .\n\u201c If my father had thrown away a perfectly good presidency by raising taxes , I think one of the things in life that I would learn is , \u2018 Don \u2019 t do that , \u2019 \u201d Norquist said . \u201c But here you have Jeb Bush going , \u2018 I learned nothing from my father \u2019 s self-immolation . \u201d\nAdd to that Bush \u2019 s left-of-party views on immigration and education , and he \u2019 s got a trio of issues where rivals would paint him as a squish , out of touch with the rock-solid conservatives who rule the early presidential primaries .\nAnd while Bush might be able to talk through education and immigration by portraying himself as a forward-thinking Republican , opponents would seize on the slightest wobble when it comes to taxes .\n\u201c \u2018 I \u2019 m running because I want to raise your taxes so I can fix Medicaid and Medicare ? \u201d said Katon Dawson , former chairman of the Republican Party in South Carolina , a state with a notoriously fierce primary . \u201c If that \u2019 s the sound bite , good luck. \u201d He said , \u201c I \u2019 ve seen \u2018 em win primaries talking about getting the burden of the government off their back . I \u2019 ve never seen a primary where they said , \u2018 We \u2019 re going to put a little more burden on your back . \u2019 \u201d\nBush \u2019 s willingness to at least contemplate tax hikes also puts him at odds with most Republicans in Washington , including their point man on all-things fiscal , Rep. Paul Ryan ( R-Wis. ) . Congressional Republicans have taken a hell-no stand on tax increases and waged a series of battles to defend it , risking a government default and scuttling a string of efforts to cut the deficit : Simpson-Bowles , the Biden group , the Gang of Six .\nBush broke with his party on taxes in a little-noticed congressional hearing in June 2012 . A Democrat on the House Budget Committee asked him if he would accept a theoretical deficit plan proposed in a 2011 presidential debate that was rejected by all eight Republican primary candidates , including Mitt Romney . At the time , Democrats pointed to the refusals as an example of Republican obstinacy on taxes .\n\u201c If you could bring to me a majority of people to say that we \u2019 re going to have $ 10 of spending cuts for $ 1 of revenue enhancement \u2014 put me in , Coach , \u201d Bush told lawmakers . \u201c This will prove I \u2019 m not running for anything , \u201d added Bush , who at the time was the subject of speculation that he might become Romney \u2019 s running mate .\nBush also noted that he had repeatedly rejected signing Norquist \u2019 s anti-tax pledge . \u201c I don \u2019 t believe you outsource your principles and convictions to people , \u201d he said .\nOf course , Bush does not want to raise taxes \u2014 he \u2019 s not pushing the idea . He \u2019 s just not automatically ruling tax hikes out as part of a bipartisan deal to address the soaring costs associated with the retirement of the 75 million-strong baby boom generation .\n\u201c Gov . Bush doesn \u2019 t support raising taxes , \u201d said spokeswoman Kristy Campbell . \u201c He also doesn \u2019 t support doing nothing about the massive national debt that has accumulated as a result of runaway spending and unsustainable entitlement programs .
