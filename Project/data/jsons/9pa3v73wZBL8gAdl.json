It kicks off what is likely to be a season of vigorous campaigning by the president .\nThere are reasons presidents have n't campaigned strongly for a successor \u2014 sometimes they 're unpopular , some nominees try to distance , some presidents were in failing health .\nHere 's a look back at the last 100 years of presidents to see just how rare it is :\nBush was wildly unpopular by the end of his second term , with the war in Iraq still raging and a job-approval rating in the 30s . There was an awkward Rose Garden endorsement in March 2008 that started a bit inauspiciously . McCain was late . Here 's how The Washington Post recapped :\n`` 'So , anyway , ' Bush said to the reporters who had assembled there to see the two men shake hands . 'As I was saying ... ' He smiled a bit , but no McCain . He did a mock soft-shoe dance . ' I 'm just going to tap-dance a little , ' the leader of the free world said . Finally , he disappeared into the White House , telling onlookers : 'Pretend like it never happened . ' ``\n`` After McCain and his wife , Cindy , finally arrived , Bush and the senator had lunch in the small dining room next to the Oval Office , then emerged for the long-anticipated endorsement by the president in the Rose Garden . Bush promised to campaign for his onetime rival and occasional legislative critic as both men seek to keep Democrats from taking over the White House . ... ' I appreciate his endorsement , ' McCain told reporters , indicating he does not intend to distance himself \u2014 at least not too much . ' I intend to have as much possible campaigning events together as is in keeping with the president 's heavy schedule .

''\nThere were a couple of hugs , Hillary Clinton and Tipper Gore clapping and swaying in the background . But that was about as warm as it got in Gore 's ill-fated 2000 campaign . The New York Times :\n`` After eight years together , here is the state of the relationship between President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore : Mr. Gore wo n't pick up the phone . He does n't call , and Mr. Clinton does n't know why . ... Mr. Clinton is both hurt by the personal rebuff and bewildered as to why his political heir wo n't come to him for the advice he is itching to give \u2014 advice the president feels the candidate needs , according to two friends who have discussed this with Mr. Clinton recently . `` The buddy movie that began when these two young Southern centrists started off on a high-energy bus tour across America in the 1992 campaign was n't supposed to end like this . ...

The New York Times wrote at the time :\n`` Many of the Republicans at the dinner here tonight expressed surprise that Mr. Reagan had not delivered a longer or more effusive endorsement of his Vice President .
