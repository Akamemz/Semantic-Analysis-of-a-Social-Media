    "content": "Sprite has a new commercial coming to your TV screens . I 'll tell you right up front that I found it chilling .\nIt is a supposedly sympathetic , loving spot where parents indulge their children 's transgender fantasies that they can actually be someone they were not born to be . One mother is seen binding the breasts of her daughter in order to make her look more boyish . Another mother helps her son put on makeup before he goes out to meet his boyfriend .\nAll these `` loving '' images come with a beautiful music bed that tugs at your heartstrings - `` let there be peace on earth '' - while at the same time coaxes you to buy into what many doctors and psychiatrists are saying is a mental disorder . And nowhere , by the way , do you see anyone taking a sip of Sprite .\nSince when did enabling people - especially children - in their confused mental state become `` loving '' ? Much less become a vehicle to sell soda ? I know what many of you are thinking . Like me , you say it 's gotten so crazy out there , sometimes you just want to try to escape , stick your head in the sand , and ignore what 's going on . But that 's just not possible anymore .\nHere 's what 's going on : the so-called `` influencers '' of our society - the media , Hollywood , the schools , your `` enlightened '' businesses - are in a determined , organized , deliberate effort to foist the most toxic and destructive behaviors on us as normal and good .
