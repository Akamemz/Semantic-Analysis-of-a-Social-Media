Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-VT ) proved you could run a real presidential campaign around grassroots support , and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D-NY ) used similar tactics last year . Republicans have launched Patriot Pass , their answer to ActBlue .\nBut as important as small-dollar donations have become , some Democrats are still reportedly heading to Wall Street as they get their campaigns up and running .\n\u201c Short of calling Exxon Mobil executives , I don \u2019 t think there \u2019 s anything worse you could do than stake your campaign out as a Wall Street campaign in 2019 , \u201d said one progressive Democratic strategist , who spoke with me on the condition of anonymity .\nIn recent weeks , I spoke with multiple strategists and fundraisers \u2014 mostly Democrats , but some Republicans \u2014 to ask whether going to Wall Street for backing in politics was still allowed . Opinions were split about eschewing cash from Wall Street \u2014 and corporate America more broadly \u2014 entirely . Those in the more progressive wing of the party said any perceived alignment was a nonstarter and unwise , even immoral . But in a competitive race with as many as 30 candidates , some are reluctant to give up any edge .\n\u201c Do you want to entirely disarm against a Republican Koch brothers-funded Death Star ? \u201d said Amanda Litman , the co-founder of Run for Something , an organization that supports young candidates running for office .\nMost agreed that small-dollar fundraising is at least the most important avenue for candidates : The ability to generate enthusiasm among a big pool of individual donors translates to enthusiasm for the campaign overall . Plus , people who give small amounts of money to a campaign are likelier to volunteer for those candidates , tell their friends about them , and vote for them . Sen. Kamala Harris \u2019 s ( D-CA ) campaign celebrated that she had received online contributions from all 50 states within half an hour of announcing her presidential bid .\nNEWS : In the first 30 minutes after she announced she was running for president , @ KamalaHarris received individual online contributions from all 50 states . \u2014 Ian Sams ( @ IanSams ) January 21 , 2019\n\u201c Money in politics isn \u2019 t going anywhere anytime soon , \u201d Adam Parkhomenko , a Democratic strategist who served as the national field director for the Democratic National Committee in 2016 , said . \u201c I don \u2019 t think there \u2019 s any reason why any Democrat needs to unilaterally disarm when it comes to fundraising . \u201d\nWall Street ties were a big deal in 2016 . We don \u2019 t know if they will be in 2020 .\nSens . Kirsten Gillibrand ( D-NY ) and Cory Booker ( D-NJ ) have come under scrutiny for their perceived ties to big financial interests , while Sens . Elizabeth Warren ( D-MA ) and Sanders are positioned as the anti-Wall Street candidates . It could turn into a dynamic similar to the one between Hillary Clinton and Sanders in 2016 , but whether it will is unclear .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not sure that Wall Street has the same sort of salience as a villain that it may have had in the last few cycles , \u201d David Gold , director of research at the public affairs firm Global Strategy Group , said .\nTo a certain extent , Gillibrand and Booker have similar plausible explanations to Clinton as to their Wall Street ties : As they are New York and New Jersey lawmakers , many of their constituents work in finance . Still , that defense didn \u2019 t help Clinton shake questions about her loyalties .\nOf course , it also comes down to candidates \u2019 records . \u201c Sanders did a good job of manipulating the campaign narrative \u201d in 2016 , Erik Smith , a partner at the strategy firm Blue Engine Message & Media , said . \u201c I \u2019 m not willing to tell you what that will be next time , because we don \u2019 t know who the candidates are . \u201d\nEven if Wall Street isn \u2019 t the villain , small-dollar donations are going to be more important .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a sign of health for their campaign , \u201d Mindy Finn , a Republican strategist , said . \u201c It also frees up a candidate to spend more of their time connecting with voters on the ground and less of their time having to cater to the wealthiest set of Americans . \u201d\nIf a candidate isn \u2019 t succeeding in online fundraising , it \u2019 s likely that he or she isn \u2019 t resonating .\n\u201c You \u2019 re seeing the valuation of a candidate \u2019 s strength based on their ability to do small-dollar fundraising , \u201d said Toby Fallsgraff , a digital strategist who worked on Barack Obama \u2019 s and Hillary Clinton \u2019 s campaigns .\nGillibrand and Harris , both of whom have launched exploratory committees , have said they won \u2019 t take corporate PAC money , as have Warren , Booker , and Sanders . It \u2019 s likely most , if not all , Democrats in the race will do the same .\nOne important sign on that front : The DNC this year will include in its primary debate criteria a candidate \u2019 s \u201c grassroots fundraising . \u201d\nThat means that even candidates who do plan to use traditional methods of fundraising will have to do small-dollar as well . That might especially spell trouble for the potential self-funders , such as billionaire Michael Bloomberg and former Starbucks executive Howard Schultz . ( Schultz reportedly might run as an independent . )\nWhile grassroots donations are probably the better way for candidates to go over taking Wall Street and corporation money , there are a lot of details and subtleties to the topic that make it a lot less cut and dried than it seems .\n\u201c It gets more nuanced , and that makes the debate a little bit more difficult , \u201d Adam Bozzi , the communications director at End Citizens United , said . \u201c There \u2019 s a difference between a bank teller and a corporate executive at a bank . \u201d\nThis means a $ 2,700 maximum donation from a Wall Street executive and 100 $ 27 donations from employees of that executive \u2019 s company tell very different stories , but it \u2019 s not always reported that way . You \u2019 ll often see reports that certain candidates got a lot of money from the banking industry , for example , but that money is often coming from employees , not executives .\nBeto O \u2019 Rourke , who is from Texas , got a lot of donations from the oil and gas industry because there are a lot of people who work in that sector where he \u2019 s from . Donors in the securities and investment industry were the No . 4 givers to Ocasio-Cortez \u2019 s congressional campaign .\nFocusing on small-dollar donations and saying no to corporate PAC checks and Wall Street bundlers seem obvious , but how to approach Super PACs might be a bit more complicated . Candidates can \u2019 t always control what outside money is spent on them , and if they shun Super PACs \u2014 including those with some Wall Street money \u2014 they may be at an important disadvantage in the general election .\nMost Democratic candidates oppose the 2010 Supreme Court Citizens United decision , which opened the door to outside spending \u2014 but like it or not , it \u2019 s the lay of the land for now . Saying no to Super PACs , including ones fueled by Wall Street money , may mean trouble .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not worth cutting off your legs to take a philosophical and moral position that will potentially cost you any shot at the nomination , \u201d Ryan Williams , a Republican strategist at Targeted Victory , said .\nThat \u2019 s the calculation both Clinton and Obama made in their elections in 2016 and 2012 .\n\u201c We \u2019 re not going to fight this fight with one hand tied behind our back , \u201d Jim Messina , Obama \u2019 s reelection campaign manager in 2012 , told the New York Times of Obama \u2019 s decision to accept backing from an outside Super PAC .\nIt is also the case that candidates can \u2019 t always control what outside money is spent on them . Many 2020 Democrats say they \u2019 ll reject Super PAC support , but such groups may be able to spend on them anyway . A nurses union Super PAC backed Sanders in 2016 , even as he slammed Clinton for her Super PAC ties .\nBut no matter what , it \u2019 s clear the fundraising landscape has changed for good .\n\u201c It seems like the days when your fundraising relied entirely on keeping a relatively small group of high-dollar donors happy are gone , \u201d Fallsgraff said .",
