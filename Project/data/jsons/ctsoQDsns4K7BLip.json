    "content": "Rio de Janeiro ( CNN ) One of the US swimmers involved in an controversial incident at a Rio de Janeiro gas station said Friday that men with badges pulled guns on them and ordered them to pay money in order to leave the scene .\nBentz 's statement describes how Lochte , a 12-time medalist who initially said the swimmers were robbed , was the member of the group who damaged property and argued with armed men who appeared to be security guards .\nBentz said the swimmers had been ordered out of a cab and were sitting on a curb as the security guards held their guns when Lochte stood up and got into a heated argument with the guards .\nA man who spoke English and Portuguese -- Bentz thinks he was a customer -- offered to translate . The man told the Americans they needed to pay the guards in order to leave .\n`` I gave them what I had in my wallet , which was a $ 20 bill , and Jimmy gave them 100 reals , which is about $ 50 in total , '' Bentz said .\nThe guards lowered their guns and the swimmers left , walking down the street to find another cab to take them back to the Olympic Village .\nBentz , in a statement released by the University of Georgia , where he is a rising junior , said the swimmers had stopped at the store to use the bathroom . Lochte had pulled a metal advertising sign off a wall as the quartet of swimmers urinated behind the gas station , he said , but there was no damage to a bathroom or its door , which was locked .\nThe swimmers were trying to leave in a cab when two security guards ordered them out of a cab . Bentz said that as Jack Conger and James Feigen walked away from the car a man held up a badge and pulled a gun on the Americans .\n`` I yelled to them to come back toward us and they complied , '' he said . `` Then the second guard drew his weapon and both guards pointed their guns at us and yelled at us to sit on a nearby sidewalk .

Police accused the swimmers of fabricating the robbery story and being involved in vandalism . Authorities brought three of them in for questioning , Bentz and Conger having been pulled off a plane bound for the United States . Lochte had already returned to the United States by the time police began their investigation .\nBentz said Friday he never made a false statement to anyone , he said . He characterized his interaction with investigators as being a witness .\nLochte originally said that he and fellow swimmers were pulled over in their taxi and robbed at gunpoint early Sunday .\n`` I wanted to apologize for my behavior last weekend -- for not being more careful and candid in how I described the events of that early morning and for my role in taking the focus away from the many athletes fulfilling their dreams of participating in the Olympics , '' he said Friday on Instagram .\nHe said he accepted responsibility for his role in the case and had `` learned some valuable lessons . ''\nCNN contributor Christine Brennan reported Friday that Lochte will eventually be suspended , according to sources with knowledge of the investigation .\nWhen asked for a comment , USA Swimming told CNN to refer to its latest statement which reads , `` USA Swimming will undergo a thorough review of the incident and determine any further actions , per our Code of Conduct . ''\nCNN also reached out to the US Olympic Committee , which referred to a statement issued Thursday night that said the organization will `` further review the matter , and any potential consequences for the athletes , when we return to the United States . ''\nLochte also did not , however , roll back on his allegations the swimmers had been robbed at gunpoint by men posing as police .\nPolice said that security guards used guns to control the athletes , adding that the Americans were drunk , and took 100 reals ( $ 20 ) to cover the damage the men caused .\n`` It 's traumatic to be out late with your friends in a foreign country -- with a language barrier -- and have a stranger point a gun at you and demand money to let you leave , '' Lochte said on Instagram .\n`` I should have been much more responsible in how I handled myself and for that am sorry to my teammates , my fans , my fellow competitors , my sponsors , and the hosts of this great event . I am very proud to represent my country in Olympic competition and this was a situation that could and should have been avoided .
