There was even a tentative date for the interview - Jan. 27 , 2018 - though one of Trump \u2019 s lawyers told \u2588\u2588\u2588 he never intended to make the president available to Mueller . And Mueller never issued a subpoena demanding testimony .\nOn Sunday , Trump \u2019 s lead attorneys - Jay Sekulow , Rudy Giuliani and husband-and-wife team Jane and Martin Raskin - were huddled at a conference table with their computers open , awaiting Barr \u2019 s summary .

Some of the lawyers had worried that if Trump had submitted to the interview , it could expose him to claims that he lied to the FBI , or made \u201c false statements , \u201d in legal terms . Giuliani publicly called an interview a \u201c perjury trap , \u201d especially if Mueller went beyond asking Trump about collusion and strayed into other matters .\nTrump is frequently called out for misstating facts or simply making things up .\nFor the past year , Trump \u2019 s lawyers pursued a two-pronged approach that relied on public attacks by Giuliani on Mueller \u2019 s \u201c witch hunt \u201d on cable TV news alongside backroom negotiations with Mueller \u2019 s team led by the Raskins , according to two sources familiar with the strategy who spoke on condition of anonymity .\nA spokesman for Mueller declined to comment for this story .\nWhen Mueller began his work in May 2017 , Trump \u2019 s legal team initially decided that cooperation was the quickest way to end the probe , according to Ty Cobb , the White House lawyer who handled the inquiry for the presidency at the time . More than 20 White House staff members were made available for special counsel interviews , and the administration handed over more than 20,000 documents .\nA burning question was whether Trump himself would agree to be interviewed . Despite the tentative date being set , Trump \u2019 s legal advisers were split . Attorney John Dowd , who at the time represented Trump personally in the inquiry , worried that an interview would be too risky .\n\u201c We \u2019 re not going to go in there and make a mistake , \u201d said Dowd , a pugnacious ex-Marine , recalling how he pushed back against Trump being interviewed even though the president had expressed willingness .\nDowd said he talked to Mueller \u2019 s team \u201c about what they had done to Flynn and Papadopoulos. \u201d Trump \u2019 s former national security adviser , Michael Flynn , and a former Trump campaign aide , George Papadopoulos , both ended up pleading guilty to lying to the FBI after submitting to special counsel interviews .\nDowd said Mueller told him he wanted to discuss 16 areas in the interview , a scope viewed as too expansive . In agreeing to the tentative interview date , Trump \u2019 s lawyers had been seeking to draw out Mueller to find out what he already knew , Dowd said .\n\u201c We wanted to know what was really on their mind .
