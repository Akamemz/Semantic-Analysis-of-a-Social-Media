Buoyed by an evergreen songbook and resurgent interest in Brian Wilson , the formerly reclusive genius behind all those glorious harmonies and arrangements , the band is marking its 50th Anniversary by calling a truce .\nAfter the death of Carl Wilson in 1998 ( drummer Dennis Wilson died in 1983 ) , the Beach Boys split into two touring factions , with Love and Bruce Johnston touring in one and Al Jardine in the other .
