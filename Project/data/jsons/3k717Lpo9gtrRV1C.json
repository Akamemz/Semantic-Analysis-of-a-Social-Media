Rand Paul , R-Kentucky , who has a little bit of libertarian running in his veins , is engaging in the most traditional form of filibuster - talk .\nIn today 's Washington the filibuster has evolved into a sort of bipartisan d\u00e9tente that most everything requires 60 votes , which has sort of made the word lose some of it 's meaning .\nBut Paul does n't have 40 votes and he wants to make a point about Brennan , the White House adviser who is seen as architect of the administration 's policy of using unmanned drone to kill suspected terrorists in foreign countries . A vote to make Brennan CIA Director could come as soon as today .\nMr. Smith would be proud . That 's how most Americans probably view a filibuster : Jimmy Stewart as Mr. Smith reading aloud for hours and hours in pursuit of righting some wrong .\nThe wrong , for Rand Paul , is the Obama administration 's targeted killing program - the use of drones to bomb suspected terrorists in foreign lands - is Constitutional . His concern hit a new level Monday when his office released a letter from Attorney General Eric Holder explaining that the administration feels it has the ability , in the extremely unlikely situation , to kill Americans on U.S. soil to avert an imminent terror attack .\n`` I rise today to begin to filibuster John Brennan 's nomination for the CIA , Paul declared at about 11:47 a.m . ET . `` I will speak until I can no longer speak . I will speak as long as it takes , until the alarm is sounded from coast to coast that our constitution is important , that your rights to trial by jury are precious , that no American should be killed by a drone on American soil without first being charged with a crime , without first being found to be guilty by a court . that Americans could be killed in a cafe in San Francisco or in a restaurant in Houston or at their home in bowling green , Kentucky , is an abomination . it is something that should not and can not be tolerated in our country . ''\nPaul said he does n't necessarily think President Obama will abuse the power . But no president , said Paul , should have the power to kill Americans in the U.S. without a trial by jury .\n`` When I asked the president , can you kill an American on American soil , it should have been an easy answer . It 's an easy question . it should have been a resounding and unequivocal , `` no . '' The president 's response ? He has n't killed anyone yet . We 're supposed to be comforted by that . The president says , I have n't killed anyone yet . He goes on to say , and I have no intention of killing Americans . But i might . Is that enough ? Are we satisfied by that ? Are we so complacent with our rights that we would allow a president to say he might kill Americans ? But he will judge the circumstances , he will be the sole arbiter , he will be the sole decider , he will be the executioner in chief if he sees fit . Now , some would say he would never do this . Many people give the president the - you know , they give him consideration , They say he 's a good man . I 'm not arguing he 's not . what I 'm arguing is that the law is there and set in place for the day when angels do n't rule government .\nMore recently , a filibuster is any time the minority party blocks something that could be passed by the majority . That can take several forms . Senators agreed earlier this year to a series of rule changes to cut down on the time it takes to move through these procedural roadblocks while preserving the minority 's right to object .\nPaul is certainly in the minority on the issue of drones and targeted killing . An \u2588\u2588\u2588 / Washington Post Poll in February of 2012 found that 83 percent of Americans support the program . Paul would argue that the program is so shrouded in secrecy that people do n't know enough about it . Drawing attention is a stated goal of his filibuster today .\nIt is important to remember that this traditional form of filibuster is doomed to fail . The human body can only go on so long . Paul has promised to talk until he ca n't talk any more , but admitted , `` Ultimately I will not win ; there are not enough votes . ''\nAs of this writing he has been going for about two hours and he has n't yet run out of things to say about drones or the Constitution .\nThe most recent talking filibuster came from U.S . Senator Bernie Sanders , who spent some 8 hours filibustering a tax bill in 2010 .\nBut the record for longest filibuster goes to former South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond , who died in 2003 , filibustered the Civil Rights Act of 1957 for 24 hours and 18 minutes .\nIt is not clear if Paul 's will last that long .
