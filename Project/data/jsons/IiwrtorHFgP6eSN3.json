It \u2019 s the newest ploy being used by Brownback to force the Kansas Legislature to pass the largest tax increase in state history and close a $ 400 million budget gap . On Tuesday , officials in the Kansas City , Kan. ( $ 11 million in potential lost funds ) , Olathe ( $ 10 million ) , Shawnee Mission ( $ 8 million ) and Blue Valley ( $ 6 million ) districts were scrambling to find out what they could do to protect the educational needs of their students . In addition , higher education leaders were looking at cutbacks of about $ 50 million .\nBrownback repeatedly threatened to veto any attempt to repeal the business income tax breaks , which are now more psychologically important to him than ever . The broad case for cutting taxes has become untenable\u2014Brownback himself pushed for a sales tax increase to 6.65 percent , the legislature settled on 6.5 percent , up from 6.15 percent\u2014leading Brownback to shift ground : taxing income is bad , taxing spending is good .\nBrownback praised what he called \u201c a pro-growth tax policy \u201d after its passage . \u201c This bill keeps the state on a path of economic growth , creating well-paying jobs that benefit all Kansans . It continues our transition from taxes on productivity to consumption-based taxes , \u201d he said in a statement .\nBut this revised claim is utterly bogus . We can see this in broad terms , as Kansas continues to lag behind national job-creation rates , as it has ever since Brownback took office in January 2011 . We can understand its bogosity more precisely by taking a close look at what it actually does , as the Kansas Center for Economic Growth did on its website with a May 28 post , \u201c Business Tax Exemption Not a Roadmap to a Stronger Economy , \u201d in which it pointed out :\nLess than 1 percent of all Kansas small businesses saw a tax savings of just over $ 38,000 . This might be enough to hire one worker full-time , depending on wage and benefits . But , if you were to hire a full-time employee with that money , after paying for benefits the take-home pay would be $ 26,600 or about $ 12.80 an hour . That \u2019 s barely above the federal poverty level for a family of three \u2013 not a roadmap to a stronger economy .\nGiven the magnitude of the lie Brownback was pushing , it was n't enough to just threaten children 's education ; lawmakers themselves had to be bullied and abused . Daily Kos blogger Chris Reeves , whose Kansas budget coverage has been cited by the Columbia Journalism Review , focused on what the lawmakers had been through after a 4 a.m. final vote :\nFor one moment , I want to put aside the bill and talk about our citizen legislators , Republicans and Democrats , who subjected themselves to what the Geneva convention refers to as torture - a 24-hour period with no schedule of sleep available of more than 4 contiguous hours .\nSuch treatment is abhorrent for anyone , of course . But what of those who should err on the side of more rest ? A key figure Reeves writes about is Heinz Dierks , a man in his 70s whose wife , Diana Dierks , 71 , a moderate Republican , represents Salina . `` I 'm here to look out for her , '' Heinz Dierks said . And she was there to do her civic duty\u2014a concept utterly foreign to men like Brownback and Jindal .\nIn some respects , what happened in Louisiana was even worse . The pure chaos and dysfunction in Louisiana\u2014and Jindal 's utter failure as a political leader\u2014was widely commented on by those who cover such things .\nThe tone was set back on May 20 , just after the legislature had definitively killed action on Jindal 's proposed so-called religious freedom law , which , like Indiana 's hastily withdrawn version , would have been a license to discriminate , when Julia O'Donoghue wrote a piece for the Times-Picayune , \u201c Louisiana lawmakers have trashed Bobby Jindal 's legislative agenda. \u201d Not only had legislators rebuffed Jindal on the right to discriminate\u2014the only piece of legislation he mentioned specifically in his opening speech to the legislature this year , and the subject of almost a third of that speech\u2014but they also refused to follow his lead on two other top priorities :\nIn his opening remarks for the legislative session , Jindal laid out three priorities\u2014the state budget , Common Core and the religious freedom bill . The Legislature has n't taken his lead of any of these issues , choosing instead to come up with their own solutions to these problems .\nHowever , as the legislature finished up its business , Will Sentell of the Advocate wrote a piece , \u201c Budget problems easily dominate 2015 Legislature , \u201d quoting key legislators and noting that everyone expected the budget \u201c would be the key topic , \u201d but that \u201c bitter and time-consuming debates over how to address the problem all but drowned other topics expected to draw attention . \u201d\nIn short , the legislature passed a budget , and that was pretty much it . But as Tyler Bridges also reported for the Advocate , \u201c while they solved the immediate crisis , Jindal and legislators fumbled the more arduous task of putting the state \u2019 s finances on sounder footing for the coming years , \u201d going on to say :\nThe $ 24.5 billion budget passed Thursday night contains so many short-term fixes that next year \u2019 s governor and Legislature will inherit a budget deficit of an estimated $ 1 billion , documents show , and the size of the deficit is only projected to grow in the following years .\nIn light of all this , not surprisingly , two different lists of winners and losers pegged Jindal as loser in all this , and Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform as a big winner\u2014though as Louisiana political journalist and historian Robert Mann noted here at \u2588\u2588\u2588 , Norquist 's smoke-and-mirrors-based victory may well have been Pyrrhic . At its heart lies Jindal 's SAVE program , as Mann explained :\nJindal and his staff proposed a convoluted , confusing student fee/tax credit \u201c offset , \u201d devised only so Jindal could claim his actions were \u201c revenue neutral \u201d and , therefore , did not increase taxes . With Norquist \u2019 s approval , Jindal pushed the so-called Student Assessment for a Valuable Education ( SAVE ) Credit Program .\nUnder SAVE , students will be assessed a $ 1,500 fee , which will be offset by a $ 1,500 tax credit . No actual money will change hands , but as the Advocate of Baton Rouge explained , \u201c the SAVE fund would create a tax credit for the $ 350 million that Jindal could use to offset $ 350 million of the new revenue that legislators are proposing to raise. \u201d The student fees magically disappear from this accounting , because # Freedom ! But the magic will likely have a very short half-life . As Mann goes on to say , \u201c The real impact of what should be called 'the Jindal-Norquist Tax Cover-up Bill of 2015 ' may be the eventual destruction of ATR \u2019 s anti-tax increase pledge . \u201d\nIn her winners and losers roundup for the Times-Picayune , Julia O'Donoghue made the case for Norquist as winner , stressing his rule-setting role , though noting his embattled national status at the end :\nBack in February , Jindal put forward an initial budget proposal that he knew Norquist would approve . The Louisiana Senate also mostly worked within the parameters laid out by Norquist . Every financial decision was shaped by the anti-tax advocate and his supporters . At one point , some Louisiana legislators reached out to Norquist directly to try to convince him to change his opinion on one piece of legislation . [ Story here . Mann 's scathing take here . ] Jindal may be courting Norquist because his organization is influential in national Republican politics and the governor is expected to run for president in 2016 . But Norquist also has an interest in keeping Jindal on his side , as he faces fallout from Republicans in a few other states\u2014notably Alabama and Kansas .\nBut Clancy DuBos offered a grittier take at the Best of New Orleans , with his list of \u201c Da winnas & da loozas , \u201d which cited Norquist as a winner because \u201c he has more sway in the Louisiana Legislature than the current governor , \u201d adding hastily that \u201c It \u2019 s not because he \u2019 s so powerful , but rather because our governor and too many lawmakers are so spineless \u2014 proving once again that in politics , as in tennis , it \u2019 s possible to win by default . \u201d\nAs for Jindal , heading up the list of \u201c da loozas , \u201d DuBos left no doubt as to why :\nHe pitched three priorities on Opening Day : repealing Common Core , passing a \u201c religious freedom \u201d bill , and ending \u201c corporate welfare \u201d ( the state-funded inventory tax rebate ) . He went 0 for 3 , gave Louisiana its largest tax hike in memory , spent most of his time campaigning for president , and managed to sink even lower in public opinion polls . His last-minute save of \u201c SAVE \u201d will be repealed in January by the next Legislature and governor , and his post-session claim of \u201c revenue neutrality \u201d will rank alongside George W. Bush \u2019 s \u201c Mission Accomplished \u201d as one of the great Orwellian claims by an American politician . More important , the world now knows that Bobby Jindal is the fiscal equivalent of Bernie Madoff \u2014 only nobody actually buys into his budgetary Ponzi scheme . If Jindal somehow gets elected president , his policies will put the U.S. economy on par with that of Greece before the end of his first term .\nShifting focus from Jindal to the political environment he 's damaged so completely , a case can be made that institutional damage in Louisiana was deeper than in Kansas , but at least politicians have begun to fight back . Hence AP 's wrap-up analysis headline \u201c Frayed relations could lead to significant change. \u201d The story by Melinda Deslatte began with the sort of blunt on-the-ground reporting that ought to end Jindal 's career :\nFrustration , even outright anger , with Gov . Bobby Jindal has been simmering in the Louisiana Legislature for years , building as the Republican governor \u2019 s presidential ambitions grew more obvious . But widespread legislative sentiment that Jindal has been making decisions based on a GOP presidential campaign he \u2019 s expected to announce June 24 may have a silver lining for the state , possibly putting limits on the next Louisiana governor \u2019 s power and forcing sweeping change for state budget and tax policy . In the just-ended legislative session , senators enacted changes to their leadership selection process aimed at limiting a governor \u2019 s meddling and increasing legislative independence . Lawmakers in both the House and Senate agreed to curtail the broad records exemptions granted to the governor , to provide more information to the public . And the state \u2019 s financial situation \u2014 hamstrung by Jindal \u2019 s rigid positions on tax discussions \u2014 has become so troubled that the next governor elected this fall will almost certainly hold a special session to allow the type of wide-ranging , needed debate on the budget and taxes that lawmakers haven \u2019 t had for years .\nIf the dysfunction in Baton Rouge sounds like Washington , and Jindal 's hostile relationship with his legislators sounds like Obama 's relationship with Congress , there are two little facts to add to sweeten the mix : The first is that Jindal loves to portray himself as the anti-Obama , and the second is that he may have a point : his hostile relationships are with chambers his own party controls .\nJindal 's insistence on being the anti-Obama requires him to produce a conservative policy miracle , and if one ca n't be created in reality , then every piece of smoke and mirrors must be perfectly arranged and dogmatically defended . ( His intensely focused devotion to this is what sets him apart from Brownback . ) We 've already had a peek at the most absurd example of this , Jindal 's SAVE program , but its absurdity needs to be understood as part of a much larger project\u2014a project to make him president . Integral to this project are a set of related claims about how well Jindal has supposedly done in shrinking the size of government\u2014supposedly cutting state payrolls by 30,000 [ shifting them to private contractors , actually ] and cutting state spending by 26 percent , claims he 's repeatedly made to the national political media , such as George Stephanopoulos on ABC 's \u201c This Week \u201d on May 31 .\nBut as Mann explained in detail on his blog Something Like the Truth , after that appearance , anyone with an Internet connection could check out state documents and easily see that Jindal was lying . Looking at the budget record during Jindal 's time in office , Mann concludes :\nCalculating the difference between Jindal \u2019 s first full budget year and his most recent complete budget year ( 2008-09 to 2014-15 ) , total state expenditures actually increased by $ 780 million ( $ 25.06 billion in 08-09 to $ 25.84 billion in 14-15 ) .\nBut that 's not the comparison Jindal is making , Mann notes . He 's comparing himself to his predecessor , Kathleen Blanco 's last year in office\u2014which makes him look better , but still not good enough :\nThe actual difference between Jindal \u2019 s most recent budget and Blanco \u2019 s last budget ( $ 2.75 billion ) is a mere 9 percent cut in state expenditures . And here \u2019 s the kicker : Whatever budget cutting Jindal has achieved appears to come primarily from a decrease in federal funding flowing into the state \u2019 s coffers ( something largely out of Jindal \u2019 s control ) .\nThat 's actually an understatement in light of the very next thing Mann tells us :\nBlanco \u2019 s last budget contained $ 12.88 billion in federal funds . Jindal \u2019 s last budget contains $ 10.07 billion in federal funds \u2013 a drop of $ 2.81 billion . That figure is greater , of course , than the $ 2.75 billion difference in Blanco \u2019 s last budget and Jindal \u2019 s most recent .\nSo more than 100 percent of the decrease was outside of Jindal 's control . I 'm really not sure if that 's a good thing or a bad thing , per se . What I do know is that it 's proof he 's a liar .\nDid Jindal cut his state \u2019 s budget by 26 percent ? Not even close . His own budget figures disprove his claim . The real question is , why do journalists like Stephanopoulos and other national media figures allow Jindal to keep making this false assertion without ever challenging him ?\nWhatever the reason , it 's a profoundly perverse belief . By trusting whatever a politician says , they give the advantage to whichever one tells the outrageously self-serving lie . It 's the worst sort of competition imaginable to encourage . If the aim is to get at the truth , this is exactly the wrong way to go about doing things .\nAs folks in the media ought to know , the way to get at the truth is to start with reporting facts . Then you assemble them and proceed to make sense of their evolution over time . Mann provides an example of this in a piece published at the Times-Picayune website after the budget deal was done , \u201c Bobby Jindal 's disgraceful fiscal legacy \u201d picks out a few highlights that illuminate the recurring themes that have run throughout Jindal 's tenure .\nPerhaps the most basic of these is a complete inability to think of anything beyond the immediate\u2014or even to see that clearly . It started with spending the surplus left by his predecessor :\nIn 2008 , Jindal inherited an $ 865 million surplus . He and legislators promptly spent it . That should have been the first hint that he knew little about sound fiscal management .\nThis was followed by misjudging state revenues , and deciding to cut taxes :\nNext , Jindal mistook the post-Katrina revenue boom ( due to a massive infusion of federal money ) for a permanent economic recovery . So , he slashed income taxes in his first regular session . Combined with ill-advised income tax cuts signed earlier by Gov . Kathleen Blanco , it was a mistake that blew an $ 800 million hole in the budget and launched us down the road to our present sad condition .\nWhich in turn created a state of perpetual dishonesty and de facto stealing :\nBecause he surrendered so much revenue in the beginning , Jindal 's budgets have always included obscene amounts of one-time money . Despite bragging that he 's balanced every budget , Jindal ended most fiscal years with a `` structural '' deficit . In other words , he only `` balanced '' the books by draining various savings accounts and trust funds . Those funds were intended for specific purposes , which did not include serving as piggy banks for times when the state 's treasury ran short of cash .\nJindal is hardly unique in this regard . Arnold Schwarzenegger engaged in the exact same sort of short-term juggling act throughout his tenure as governor of California , initiated by blowing a $ 6.5 billion hole in the budget with his grandstanding rollback of the state 's vehicle license fee , then turning to borrowing and gimmickry . The state only regained its long-term fiscal balance after Democrat Jerry Brown was elected in 2010 . It 's not that Brown succeeded where Schwarzenegger failed , the two men were trying to do fundamentally different things . Schwarzenegger was trying to make everything look good on paper , at least for the moment . Brown was trying to run a state , as a steward of it for future generations .\nAlthough Schwarzenegger was widely seen as an anomalously liberal Republican on issues like gay rights and the environment , his budget record clearly revealed the narrow limits , not of Republican solutions to economic challenges , but of Republicans ' ability to even see problems are , as opposed to the secondary and tertiary problems that are entirely of their own making . And the rest of us will be dragged along for the ride , at least as things stand now . As long the national media takes the George Stephanopoulos approach of swallowing GOP lies whole , we will remain mired in failure after failure , without even a clue to what 's going on . If we want to stop being clueless\u2014about the problems as well as the solutions\u2014we 've got to watch what they do , not what they say .",

As Mann goes on to say, \u201cThe real impact of what should be called 'the Jindal-Norquist Tax Cover-up Bill of 2015' may be the eventual destruction of ATR\u2019s anti-tax increase pledge.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nIn her winners and losers roundup for the Times-Picayune, Julia O'Donoghue made the case for Norquist as winner, stressing his rule-setting role, though noting his embattled national status at the end:\n\nBack in February, Jindal put forward an initial budget proposal that he knew Norquist would approve. The Louisiana Senate also mostly worked within the parameters laid out by Norquist. Every financial decision was shaped by the anti-tax advocate and his supporters. At one point, some Louisiana legislators reached out to Norquist directly to try to convince him to change his opinion on one piece of legislation. [Story here. Mann's scathing take here.] Jindal may be courting Norquist because his organization is influential in national Republican politics and the governor is expected to run for president in 2016. But Norquist also has an interest in keeping Jindal on his side, as he faces fallout from Republicans in a few other states\u2014notably Alabama and Kansas.\n\nBut Clancy DuBos offered a grittier take at the Best of New Orleans, with his list of \u201cDa winnas & da loozas,\u201d which cited Norquist as a winner because \u201che has more sway in the Louisiana Legislature than the current governor,\u201d adding hastily that \u201cIt\u2019s not because he\u2019s so powerful, but rather because our governor and too many lawmakers are so spineless \u2014 proving once again that in politics, as in tennis, it\u2019s possible to win by default.\u201d\n\nAs for Jindal, heading up the list of \u201cda loozas,\u201d DuBos left no doubt as to why:\n\nHe pitched three priorities on Opening Day: repealing Common Core, passing a \u201creligious freedom\u201d bill, and ending \u201ccorporate welfare\u201d (the state-funded inventory tax rebate). He went 0 for 3, gave Louisiana its largest tax hike in memory, spent most of his time campaigning for president, and managed to sink even lower in public opinion polls. His last-minute save of \u201cSAVE\u201d will be repealed in January by the next Legislature and governor, and his post-session claim of \u201crevenue neutrality\u201d will rank alongside George W. Bush\u2019s \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d as one of the great Orwellian claims by an American politician. More important, the world now knows that Bobby Jindal is the fiscal equivalent of Bernie Madoff \u2014 only nobody actually buys into his budgetary Ponzi scheme. If Jindal somehow gets elected president, his policies will put the U.S. economy on par with that of Greece before the end of his first term.\n\nShifting focus from Jindal to the political environment he's damaged so completely, a case can be made that institutional damage in Louisiana was deeper than in Kansas, but at least politicians have begun to fight back. Hence AP's wrap-up analysis headline \u201cFrayed relations could lead to significant change.\u201d The story by Melinda Deslatte began with the sort of blunt on-the-ground reporting that ought to end Jindal's career:\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nFrustration, even outright anger, with Gov. Bobby Jindal has been simmering in the Louisiana Legislature for years, building as the Republican governor\u2019s presidential ambitions grew more obvious. But widespread legislative sentiment that Jindal has been making decisions based on a GOP presidential campaign he\u2019s expected to announce June 24 may have a silver lining for the state, possibly putting limits on the next Louisiana governor\u2019s power and forcing sweeping change for state budget and tax policy. In the just-ended legislative session, senators enacted changes to their leadership selection process aimed at limiting a governor\u2019s meddling and increasing legislative independence. Lawmakers in both the House and Senate agreed to curtail the broad records exemptions granted to the governor, to provide more information to the public. And the state\u2019s financial situation \u2014 hamstrung by Jindal\u2019s rigid positions on tax discussions \u2014 has become so troubled that the next governor elected this fall will almost certainly hold a special session to allow the type of wide-ranging, needed debate on the budget and taxes that lawmakers haven\u2019t had for years.\n\nIf the dysfunction in Baton Rouge sounds like Washington, and Jindal's hostile relationship with his legislators sounds like Obama's relationship with Congress, there are two little facts to add to sweeten the mix: The first is that Jindal loves to portray himself as the anti-Obama, and the second is that he may have a point: his hostile relationships are with chambers his own party controls.\n\nJindal's insistence on being the anti-Obama requires him to produce a conservative policy miracle, and if one can't be created in reality, then every piece of smoke and mirrors must be perfectly arranged and dogmatically defended. (His intensely focused devotion to this is what sets him apart from Brownback.) We've already had a peek at the most absurd example of this, Jindal's SAVE program, but its absurdity needs to be understood as part of a much larger project\u2014a project to make him president. Integral to this project are a set of related claims about how well Jindal has supposedly done in shrinking the size of government\u2014supposedly cutting state payrolls by 30,000 [shifting them to private contractors, actually] and cutting state spending by 26 percent, claims he's repeatedly made to the national political media, such as George Stephanopoulos on ABC's \u201cThis Week\u201d on May 31.\n\nBut as Mann explained in detail on his blog Something Like the Truth, after that appearance, anyone with an Internet connection could check out state documents and easily see that Jindal was lying. Looking at the budget record during Jindal's time in office, Mann concludes:\n\nCalculating the difference between Jindal\u2019s first full budget year and his most recent complete budget year (2008-09 to 2014-15), total state expenditures actually increased by $780 million ($25.06 billion in 08-09 to $25.84 billion in 14-15).\n\nBut that's not the comparison Jindal is making, Mann notes. He's comparing himself to his predecessor, Kathleen Blanco's last year in office\u2014which makes him look better, but still not good enough:\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe actual difference between Jindal\u2019s most recent budget and Blanco\u2019s last budget ($2.75 billion) is a mere 9 percent cut in state expenditures. And here\u2019s the kicker: Whatever budget cutting Jindal has achieved appears to come primarily from a decrease in federal funding flowing into the state\u2019s coffers (something largely out of Jindal\u2019s control).\n\nThat's actually an understatement in light of the very next thing Mann tells us:\n\nBlanco\u2019s last budget contained $12.88 billion in federal funds. Jindal\u2019s last budget contains $10.07 billion in federal funds \u2013 a drop of $2.81 billion. That figure is greater, of course, than the $2.75 billion difference in Blanco\u2019s last budget and Jindal\u2019s most recent.\n\nSo more than 100 percent of the decrease was outside of Jindal's control. I'm really not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing, per se. What I do know is that it's proof he's a liar.\n\nIn the end, Mann concludes:\n\nDid Jindal cut his state\u2019s budget by 26 percent? Not even close. His own budget figures disprove his claim. The real question is, why do journalists like Stephanopoulos and other national media figures allow Jindal to keep making this false assertion without ever challenging him?\n\nWhatever the reason, it's a profoundly perverse belief. By trusting whatever a politician says, they give the advantage to whichever one tells the outrageously self-serving lie. It's the worst sort of competition imaginable to encourage. If the aim is to get at the truth, this is exactly the wrong way to go about doing things.\n\nAs folks in the media ought to know, the way to get at the truth is to start with reporting facts. Then you assemble them and proceed to make sense of their evolution over time. Mann provides an example of this in a piece published at the Times-Picayune website after the budget deal was done, \u201cBobby Jindal's disgraceful fiscal legacy\u201d picks out a few highlights that illuminate the recurring themes that have run throughout Jindal's tenure.\n\nPerhaps the most basic of these is a complete inability to think of anything beyond the immediate\u2014or even to see that clearly. It started with spending the surplus left by his predecessor:\n\nIn 2008, Jindal inherited an $865 million surplus. He and legislators promptly spent it. That should have been the first hint that he knew little about sound fiscal management.\n\nThis was followed by misjudging state revenues, and deciding to cut taxes:\n\nNext, Jindal mistook the post-Katrina revenue boom (due to a massive infusion of federal money) for a permanent economic recovery. So, he slashed income taxes in his first regular session. Combined with ill-advised income tax cuts signed earlier by Gov. Kathleen Blanco, it was a mistake that blew an $800 million hole in the budget and launched us down the road to our present sad condition.\n\nWhich in turn created a state of perpetual dishonesty and de facto stealing:\n\nBecause he surrendered so much revenue in the beginning, Jindal's budgets have always included obscene amounts of one-time money. Despite bragging that he's balanced every budget, Jindal ended most fiscal years with a \"structural\" deficit. In other words, he only \"balanced\" the books by draining various savings accounts and trust funds. Those funds were intended for specific purposes, which did not include serving as piggy banks for times when the state's treasury ran short of cash.\n\nJindal is hardly unique in this regard. Arnold Schwarzenegger engaged in the exact same sort of short-term juggling act throughout his tenure as governor of California, initiated by blowing a $6.5 billion hole in the budget with his grandstanding rollback of the state's vehicle license fee, then turning to borrowing and gimmickry. The state only regained its long-term fiscal balance after Democrat Jerry Brown was elected in 2010. It's not that Brown succeeded where Schwarzenegger failed, the two men were trying to do fundamentally different things. Schwarzenegger was trying to make everything look good on paper, at least for the moment. Brown was trying to run a state, as a steward of it for future generations.\n\nAlthough Schwarzenegger was widely seen as an anomalously liberal Republican on issues like gay rights and the environment, his budget record clearly revealed the narrow limits, not of Republican solutions to economic challenges, but of Republicans' ability to even see problems are, as opposed to the secondary and tertiary problems that are entirely of their own making. And the rest of us will be dragged along for the ride, at least as things stand now. As long the national media takes the George Stephanopoulos approach of swallowing GOP lies whole, we will remain mired in failure after failure, without even a clue to what's going on. If we want to stop being clueless\u2014about the problems as well as the solutions\u2014we've got to watch what they do, not what they say.",
