    "content": "Round 2 Of Clinton-Trump Proves Combative \u2014 But Provides No Knockout\nThe second debate between presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton promised a great deal and managed to deliver on much of it . But those expecting either to see Trump knocked out of the race or to see him dramatically reverse the current campaign momentum went away disappointed .\nIt could be said this meeting had the highest stakes ever for any single debate , even as it set new lows for the level of personal attacks .\nMany questions hovered over the proceedings at Washington University in St. Louis : How would Trump deal with the fallout from a videotape released Friday in which he brags about treating women in ways that amount to sexual assault ? Would he denounce the dozens of notable Republicans who have deserted his cause in the past two days ? Would he be contrite and seek the voters ' forgiveness ?\nOr would Trump fight back with allusions to the sex scandals of Clinton 's husband , Bill Clinton , when he was president ? Just before debate time , Trump held an impromptu news conference on Facebook Live , flanked by four women . Three had accused Bill Clinton of assaulting them in the past \u2014 one as far back as 1978 . The fourth had objected to the way Hillary Clinton , as a court appointed attorney , had once defended the man accused of raping her when she was 12 . All of these stories had been the subject of extensive reporting when Bill Clinton was president in the 1990s .\nAnd there were other compelling story lines as well . Would the moderators hold Trump 's feet to the fire on taxes or Clinton 's on her email server ? What might be made of the latest email trove released by WikiLeaks over the weekend ? Had Clinton really told a Wall Street gathering that a policymaker needed a private position as well as a public position on a given issue ?\nThe debate was held Sunday night over the course of 94 minutes \u2014 and many of the hovering questions were addressed , if not answered . There was also time for questions from the auditorium audience and social media users who submitted their queries online .\nThe debate moderators , veterans Martha Raddatz of ABC and Anderson Cooper of CNN , relayed questions from the Internet and called on audience members to present their own . It made for a more interactive experience for the tens of millions watching the debate on TV or online . Both candidates chose to walk to the edge of the stage at times to address the questioner , who was often just a few feet away .\nThe candidates were asked whether they were providing good role models for the young . Both said they were but that their opponent was n't . Soon , the conversation turned to the videotape and then to Trump 's charges against Bill Clinton .\nAnother questioner wanted to know how the candidates would fight Islamophobia , another asked if they would be `` devoted '' to treating all kinds of people equally . Other questions went to the Supreme Court vacancy , the need for balanced energy policy , the crisis in Syria and the state of the economy .\nAt the end of the debate , a man named Karl Becker asked both candidates to cite something admirable about their opponent . Clinton promptly said she admired Trump 's children . Trump just as quickly said : `` She 's a fighter . ... she does n't quit . '' At that point , the debate ended and the two moved toward each other at center stage . There they , finally , shook hands . ( They did n't shake at the start of the debate . )\nOne way to sum up the clash of the candidates would be to say they both performed about as well as could have been expected under the circumstances .\nThat may be a case of `` grading on a curve , '' but the test itself was all but unprecedented . One candidate came in with a major videotape crisis raging , his campaign in emergency mode and high-profile desertions among supporters in the headlines . Many in his own party were calling on him to withdraw as the nominee .\nThe other candidate came in knowing some of the most painful moments in her marriage were about to be thrown in her face with her husband 's accusers in the room , staring straight at her .\nDoing as well as he did represented an improvement for Donald Trump by comparison with his flawed and damaging performance in the first debate . Trump was getting proper credit for this from many quarters Sunday night , as GOP officials showed considerable relief . There was no more talk of forcing him off the ticket , or of Mike Pence bailing out as running mate or Kellyanne Conway leaving the campaign .\nTrump 's campaign retinue seemed especially pleased that he had shown more seriousness , focus and self-control than in the first debate . Yet he persisted in describing various policies and other aspects of the world in ways contradicted by facts and analysis . As usual , he relied on the starkest and most superlative terms . He used the words disaster and complete disaster more than a dozen times . He said if elected he would do everything he could to put Hillary Clinton in jail .\nHe said Clinton was `` by far the biggest beneficiary '' of the Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court .

It has been supported by Trump and his running mate .\nTrump also spoke of record traffic in drugs across the Mexican border , offering no support for the claim . He wandered back into the thickets of the `` birther controversy .
