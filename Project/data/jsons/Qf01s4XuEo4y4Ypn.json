Scientists are racing to discover how it spreads so quickly .\nAccording to Anthony Fauci , `` between 25 % and 50 % '' of people may be asymptomatic carriers \u2014 people who are contagious but not physically sick .\nThese carriers are thought to play a significant role in the virus ' spread and are the reason US residents have been asked to start covering their faces in public .\nAt least one-third of the world is under some type of lockdown because of the coronavirus pandemic , as governments urge social distancing to stymie the virus ' spread .\n`` There 's significant transmission by people not showing symptoms , '' Stephen Morse , an epidemiologist at Columbia University , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nAccording to Anthony Fauci , the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease , `` somewhere between 25 % and 50 % '' of people infected with the new coronavirus may never show symptoms or fall ill \u2014 but can still transmit the illness to others .\nDuring a White House briefing on Sunday , Fauci cautioned that this was just an estimate , and said there is disagreement even among his colleagues as to how many people are asymptomatic . He added that antibody tests \u2014 which can confirm whether a person has already had COVID-19 \u2014 are needed to answer that question `` in a scientifically sound way .

''\nThe prevalence of asymptomatic transmission does n't bode well for global containment efforts , as Bill Gates recently wrote in an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine .\n`` That means COVID-19 will be much harder to contain than the Middle East respiratory syndrome or severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) , which were spread much less efficiently and only by symptomatic people , '' Gates said .\nA worker taking the temperature of a customer at the entrance of a Walmart store in Wuhan , China , on January 27 .
