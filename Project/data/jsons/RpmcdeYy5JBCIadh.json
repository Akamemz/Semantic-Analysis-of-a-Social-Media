To keep things interesting , I won \u2019 t list anyone \u2013 you know who you are \u2013 more than once on this list . Feel free to fire up your \u201c I \u2019 m surprised you \u2019 re surprised \u201d tweets\u2026\nU.S .

Congressman John Culberson , on President Obama : \u201c He shook hands \u2013 first time the United States president has shaken hands with the dictator of Tehran since 1979 is Barack Obama , and he did it right in the middle of when he was telling us [ Congressional Republicans ] no negotiation . I mean , these are facts . And you \u2019 ve seen the response is no negotiation . I mean , that \u2019 s inescapable fact . Right ?

It \u2019 s meant profits for companies that outsource , but it \u2019 s not worked for communities , for jobs , for manufacturing , for local small manufacturing especially .
