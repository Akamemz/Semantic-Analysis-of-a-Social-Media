No injuries were reported .\n`` There is nothing that can stop the regime ... except military intervention , '' Syrian rebels say\nEstimates of 350 to 1,300 civilians killed in gas attack last week\nA limited military strike against Syria might convince the Assad regime not to use chemical weapons again but it wo n't change the balance of power in the Syrian civil war or bring about President Obama 's stated goal of regime change , analysts and rebels say .\nSyrian President Bashar Assad `` has used all kinds of weapons , chemical and cluster bombs during massacres in Syria , '' said Abu Jaafar al-Mugarbel , an activist based in Homs , in western Syria .\n`` There is nothing that can stop the regime from doing that except military intervention . It is not the best way forward but there is nothing else after all that has happened , '' he said .\nSecretary of State John Kerry said Monday that it is clear the Assad regime used chemical weapons last week and that Obama believes such action should lead to consequences . He made his remarks from Jordan as United Nations inspectors were investigating the site where the alleged chemical weapons massacre happened outside of Damascus .\n`` President Obama believes there must be accountability for those who would use chemical weapons , '' Kerry said . `` Nothing today is more serious . ''\nThe attack should `` shock the consciousness of the world , '' Kerry said . `` This is about the large scale indiscriminate use of weapons that the civilized world long ago agreed should never be used . ''\nU.S. officials have said Obama is considering military options after the gas attack last week left as many as 1,300 people dead . French and British officials have said a limited , punitive strike is under consideration .\nA limited strike would allow Obama to say he 's following through on his warning a year ago that Assad would incur U.S. `` game changing '' action if he used chemical weapons , but it would also allow Assad to continue prosecuting a war that has already cost more than 100,000 Syrian lives , caused radicals to stream into Syria and spread violence into neighboring countries , said Tony Badran , an analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies .\n`` The casualty toll , the ability of unsavory actors to further entrench themselves , the ability of Assad to consolidate a part of the country under his control and continuing to destabilize neighbors -- all that stuff continues to play out , '' under a limited strike , Badran said .\nIt 's not even clear whether a limited strike would cause Assad or his commanders to refrain from using chemical weapons again , said Ken Pollack , a former CIA analyst and former Middle East expert at the National Security Council .\n`` At the end of the day , the purpose of this response is really going to be about deterrence , '' Pollack said . But `` we have no freakin ' clue what 's going on inside the regime . ''\nIt 's unclear who 's making decisions and what the Syrian command structure is , he said , and `` that makes it really hard to structure a deterrence message or to know how it will be received . ''\nThe administration hopes the regime remains unified , `` that a group of reasonable people are at the top of the chain of command , and that they read the message the way we want them to , '' Pollack said .\nThe problem is the Obama administration has n't articulated a clear policy for Syria or a clear strategy for how to accomplish it , Pollack said .\nThe administration has said it is expanding military assistance to the armed opposition , but there 's no evidence of that assistance arriving in rebel hands . The administration wants the two sides to negotiate a resolution in Geneva , but the planned conference has been delayed and the list of participants has yet to be agreed upon .\n`` We have a stated goal of regime change but in a practical matter it 's just not clear what the White House is trying to do in Syria , '' he said . `` Nothing the adminisration is thinking about is going to bring about its real goals . ''\nThe military action under consideration now comes as United Nations weapons inspectors investigate the site of an attack last week that Syrian activists and medical personnel said killed hundreds with poison gas . Obama had said a year ago that chemical weapons are a red line that would elicit a `` game changing '' U.S. response .\nIn June , U.S. officials determined that Assad 's forces had used chemical weapons three times already , and announced plans to arm the rebels fighting to topple his regime . Former administration officials , such as then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta , have said they fear that a collapse of the Assad regime will allow his considerable arsenal of chemical weapons to fall into the wrong hands , including the Iran-backed terrorist group Hezbollah and al Qaeda-linked militias fighting the regime in Syria .\nBadran says how effective the strike by the USA and its allies is depends on the list of targets .\n`` The question is whether your intervention will have the broader goal of removal of this regime , '' Badran said . `` Based on how they 're talking about it \u2013 punitive strike related to this issue of chemical weapons \u2013 they 're defining it very narrowly , as a slap on the wrist , do n't do that again .
