Trump argued there was a double standard when it came to his tax returns and Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton \u2019 s emails .\nHowever , as Stephanopoulos continued to press Trump on the issue , Trump fired back by pointing out Stephanopoulos \u2019 prior relationship with the Bill and Hillary Clinton and noted it was something he didn \u2019 t reveal .\nSTEPHANOPOULOS : Let \u2019 s talk about your tax return . Under new pressure from the Clinton campaign , Secretary Clinton talking about that the last couple of days . I just have a bottom line question for you . Yes or no , do you believe voters have a right to see your tax returns before they make a final decision ?\nTRUMP : I don \u2019 t think they do . But I do say this , I will really gladly give them \u2014 not going to learn anything but it \u2019 s under routine audit . When the audit ends I \u2019 ll present them . That should be before the election . I hope it \u2019 s before the election . But when the audit ends I \u2019 ve had even journalists say that , no , nobody should give until audits are over and have had journalists say that . So I think if there \u2019 s no \u2014 I sort of have to laugh when Clinton says it , Mrs. Clinton said I should give my tax what about all the emails or missing Goldman Sachs speeches . When is she going to give that ? Very great hypocrite but as far as I \u2019 m concerned I want to give it as soon as possible , as soon as the audit every year \u2014 I have wealthy friends that never get audited .\nSTEPHANOPOULOS : As you know the audit is no excuse . The IRS has made it very clear an audit is not a bar to public release . It is entirely your choice . President Nixon released his tax returns even though he was under audit . And when you were seeking a casino license in Pennsylvania and New Jersey , you released the returns to the state officials even though you were under audit .\nTRUMP : I am under audit now and as soon as the audit ends I \u2019 ll release my returns . If you look at many others , many others feel the same way and almost every lawyer will tell you the same thing \u2013when you \u2019 re under audit you finish the audit before you release . I have no problem and it should be and I hope it \u2019 s before the election .\nTRUMP : By the way , people will learn nothing . I put in financials 100 pages worth of financials that show that I built a company that \u2019 s worth more than $ 10 billion . It shows cash . It shows cash flows . Returns but nevertheless , when the audit is complete , i will release . I have no problem with it .\nSTEPHANOPOULOS : A couple of follow-ups to that . If you are willing to release your tax returns to get a casino license , why shouldn \u2019 t voters see them before they make you commander in chief ?\nTRUMP : well , because at the time it didn \u2019 t make a ny if you take a look at the picture that we sent you with a tax returns probably ten feet high when you stack them on top and lengthy and complex . I built a massive business and want to make sure that everything is perfect . It a routine audit and get through it first and that \u2019 s what I \u2019 ll do . There have been many presidents that have not shown their tax returns .\nTRUMP : Before 1976 , people didn \u2019 t do it . It used to be a secret thing . I don \u2019 t want it to be secret , but I do want the audit to get finished .\nSTEPHANOPOULOS : Before that Richard Nixon released his returns as I said , but to get to your point on the one hand you show that stack and on the other hand you say people can \u2019 t learn anything . They can actually learn quite a lot . They can learn your sources of income . They can learn whether you have any foreign sources of income or any Swiss bank accounts or other offshore accounts . Do you ?\nTRUMP : I tell you right now , I do not . I do not have Swiss bank accounts . I don \u2019 t have offshore \u2014 I really have a very , very clean company . And believe me , if i didn \u2019 t , it would have been reported by 200 groups because there \u2019 s nobody that has more reporting or more scrutiny than I have . I have given my financials , they \u2019 re extraordinary . And we would have read if they weren \u2019 t . But believe me when i release my financial , George and sent them down to Federal Elections , there was a feeding frenzy by the media and they reported , wow , that is a great company and I have built a great , great company and by the way , when you look at numbers , when you look at incomes , when you look at all of the things or most of the things you talked about that \u2019 s reported on the financials .\nSTEPHANOPOULOS : It \u2019 s not reported on the financials . What they don \u2019 t know also is your tax rate . they don \u2019 t show whether you paid a low \u2013\nTRUMP : I try very hard to pay as little tax as possible and have said that for the last two years . I fight very hard because this country wastes our money . They take our tax money and throw it down the drain . They spend $ 4 trillion in the Middle East and we can \u2019 t fix a road or a bridge . And I fight very hard . I consider it an expense because , frankly , our country doesn \u2019 t know what they \u2019 re doing with our money or tax money and that \u2019 s part of the problem . So I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible .\nTRUMP : It \u2019 s none of your business . You \u2019 ll see it when I release but I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible .\nSTEPHANOPOULOS : You know , we \u2019 ve talked about this several times over the last several years . I first asked about it in 2011 . You said you would release your tax returns then thinking of running for president when President Obama releases his birth certificate . He did . Then you said you would release your tax returns when Secretary Clinton releases her emails . She has turned over all emails in her possession .\nTRUMP : There \u2019 s plenty of missing . I read yesterday that there were a lot of emails missing . I know you \u2019 re a good friends of hers and I know you worked for her , but you didn \u2019 t reveal it . But you know she did not turn over her emails . There are a lot of emails missing .\nSTEPHANOPOULOS : There were emails from her staffers missing .

There are emails missing all over the place .\nSTEPHANOPOULOS : You said then that you were just going through all of the returns and you will release them now you \u2019 re throwing up the audit .\nTRUMP : I never said that at all .
