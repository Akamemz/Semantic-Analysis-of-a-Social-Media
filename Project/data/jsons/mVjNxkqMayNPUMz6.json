But the issue of family members and others being subjected to an expanded background check system for sales between them has become an obstacle .\nThe NRA and other gun-rights advocates , while arguing the checks would eventually lead to a federal gun registry , also said they would be too cumbersome for the two groups \u2013 citing faraway trips to government offices and mandatory record keeping .
