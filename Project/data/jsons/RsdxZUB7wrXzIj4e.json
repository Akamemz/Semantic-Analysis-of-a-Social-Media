    "content": "Donald Trump \u2019 s national security adviser , Michael Flynn , may be in a lot of trouble .\nLate Thursday night , the Washington Post reported that Flynn had called Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak on December 29 , the same day that Obama had slapped new sanctions on Russia in retaliation for its hack of the US election . The conversation covered the sanctions , and , according to two officials , suggested that the Trump administration would be rolling back the sanctions in the future .\nThat would mean Flynn had been actively trying to undermine Obama administration policy while not yet in office \u2014 a big , questionably legal no-no . Indeed , the FBI is currently investigating the content of the Flynn calls .\nThe Trump administration repeatedly and publicly denied that Flynn had spoken to Kislyak about sanctions , even enlisting Vice President Mike Pence to back him up in the media . Flynn himself told the Post on Wednesday that he hadn \u2019 t talked about sanctions . But the Post spoke to nine former and current US officials with knowledge of the call , which was actually recorded by US intelligence agencies ( as all such high-level calls to the Russian ambassador are ) . Subsequent reporting from other outlets backed the Post up .\nOn Thursday , Flynn , through his spokesperson , backed away from the denial . The spokesperson said Flynn \u201c indicated that while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions , he couldn \u2019 t be certain that the topic never came up . \u201d\nAll of which means that it \u2019 s very likely that Flynn lied about the content of his talks with the Russian ambassador . That leaves two big outstanding questions :\nDid Flynn lie to Pence about sanctions , or did Pence knowingly lie to the American public ? Did Flynn lie to FBI investigators , too ?\nThe answers could help determine whether Flynn keeps his job \u2014 and , potentially , whether he faces criminal charges .\nQuestions about Flynn \u2019 s relationship with Russia go all the way back to the campaign , where he served as one of Trump \u2019 s top national security staffers . Flynn has spoken very positively about the prospect of partnering with Putin \u2019 s regime to fight terrorism , and repeatedly appeared on Russia \u2019 s English-language propaganda outlet , RT . Flynn was so in with RT that he had been paid to give a speech at its 10th anniversary dinner in Moscow \u2014 where he sat at the head table with Putin himself .\nSo when Obama imposed sanctions on Russia in retaliation for the election hack , the widespread expectation was that Flynn would work to roll them back once in office . But attempting to undermine them before taking power \u2014 on literally the day they were imposed \u2014 was something else . It could , arguably , violate the Logan Act , a law which prohibits people outside the executive branch from making foreign policy on behalf of the US administration ( though no one has ever been prosecuted under this act ) .\nThe first public report of the call came on January 12 , in a column by the Washington Post \u2019 s David Ignatius . Follow-ups came swiftly , with administration sources saying the two men had spoken multiple times on the 29th but that they hadn \u2019 t discussed sanctions .\nThat rang hollow to many close observers of the Kremlin , who noted that just one day later Putin announced that he would not retaliate against the US for the sanctions . That was a sharp break with Putin \u2019 s normal policy of hitting back hard for any slight , real or perceived . It makes a lot more sense if Putin had just gotten assurances from the next national security adviser that the sanctions would soon go away .\nThe Trump administration denied that the call was about the sanctions . Trump spokesperson Sean Spicer told reporters that call had grown out of an exchange of holiday greetings on December 25 \u2014 a questionable story given that this year \u2019 s Russian Orthodox Christmas was actually on January 9 , 2017 .\nOn January 15 , the White House rolled out a heavyweight : Vice President Pence went on Fox and CBS \u2019 widely watched Sunday talk shows to sell the Christmas-not-sanctions story .\n\u201c It was initiated when on Christmas Day , he had sent a text to the Russian ambassador to express not only Christmas wishes but sympathy for the loss of life in [ a Russian ] airline crash that took place \u201d at the time , Pence said during a January 15 appearance on CBS \u2019 s Face the Nation . \u201c It was strictly coincidental that they had a conversation , they did not discuss anything having to do with the United States \u2019 decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia . \u201d\nThe general outlines of the administration \u2019 s story meandered and wavered in some weird ways , as Just Security \u2019 s Kate Brannen documents in depth .
