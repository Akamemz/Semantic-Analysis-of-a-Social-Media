    "content": "The Trump administration \u2019 s announcement Tuesday , that it will end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) program \u2014 removing deportation protection and work permits from nearly 800,000 young unauthorized immigrants \u2014 unless Congress passes a bill in the next six months to protect DACA recipients , isn \u2019 t a punt or a reprieve . It \u2019 s an opportunity to deflect , or share , the responsibility for what would be an unprecedented act in US history .\nThere \u2019 s never really been a time when a generation of people , raised and rooted in the United States , has been stripped of official recognition and pushed back into the precarity of unauthorized-immigrant life .\nEven though DACA never officially legalized anyone , ending it would be , in a way , the biggest \u201c illegalization \u201d of immigrants in American history .\nAs a policy matter , it 's straightforward : Ending DACA is unprecedented because DACA itself was more or less unprecedented . Never in US history had the government offered protection to so many people who did n't have ( and were n't subsequently given ) the opportunity to get full legal status from there .\nThe government has a lot of power to shape immigrants \u2019 lives \u2014 but it \u2019 s never had perfect control over who immigrates to begin with . The history of immigrants who received DACA protections is unique , and the legal status to legitimize or delegitimize them is too . Often as not , when politicians try to reconcile law and reality , the result is that the law gets changed to bend to the reality \u2014 not that the reality is changed by enforcing or changing the law .\nDACA was one such attempt . If Congress and the White House can \u2019 t agree on a bill within a six-month timeframe , and the Trump administration rescinds DACA , the US will be in wholly uncharted territory .\nUndoing DACA would widen the gulf between reality and law . And that gulf is , in some ways , broader than it \u2019 s ever been before . What truly makes the end of DACA unprecedented , in the broad sweep of US history , is the size of that gap between the law and the reality .\nWith DACA hanging in the balance , America has a group of people on the verge of being socially integrated , but legally isolated \u2014 socially championed , but legally victimized \u2014 in a way we \u2019 ve never really seen before .\nThe choice between reconciling the law with the reality and creating an unprecedented chasm between the two lies with Congress and the White House . The stakes could not be higher .\nGrowing up an unauthorized immigrant in the US is relatively uncommon in American history\nFor as long as there have been immigration laws , there have been people trying to ( and often succeeding in ) circumventing them . But the stereotype of the \u201c illegal immigrant \u201d \u2014 a Mexican or Central American man who crossed the US/Mexico border without papers \u2014 comes from a phenomenon that \u2019 s only been in place for the past 40 or 50 years , at most .\nHistorically , it was easy enough to cross the US/Mexico border and work in the US \u2014 both because it was simply easier to enter the country by land without being detected than to sail into New York harbor , and because ( partly because it was so hard to regulate ) the US government didn \u2019 t restrict immigration from the Americas the way it did from the Eastern Hemisphere .\nIt was so easy , in fact , that immigrants were often simply migrating back and forth . \u201c Immigrants preferred to live in Mexico for most of the time , \u201d Stanford historian Ana Minian explains , \u201c and then come for short periods of time , sometimes up to a couple years , and then return to Mexico until they needed to come back again . \u201d\nIt wasn \u2019 t until the second half of the 20th century that the US made it harder to legally immigrate from Mexico . After that , it was still possible to come to the US and work \u2014 just not legally . So the circular migration continued , but its legal status changed .\nThe circular flow didn \u2019 t stop until the 1990s , when the US started building up border security . But instead of a bulked-up border causing migrants to settle in Mexico , immigrants often settled in the US to avoid repeated risky border crossings \u2014 and their families crossed north to settle alongside them .\nBefore the 1990s , it wasn \u2019 t necessary for a child to settle in the US without papers in order to keep a family both employed and together . After the 2000s , when net unauthorized migration from Mexico dropped to zero \u2014 and with children coming from Central America often for humanitarian reasons as much as anything else \u2014 there wasn \u2019 t a flow of children coming without the opportunity to get legal status upon arrival .\nSurely this narrative doesn \u2019 t encompass every DREAMer \u2019 s personal story , but it helps explain why there are so many people who are currently young adults who \u2019 ve grown up among American citizens , as unauthorized immigrants .\nIt explains why so many of them haven \u2019 t just lived in the US since they were 6 years old , but haven \u2019 t even seen their home countries since then ( even a brief family visit could exile them from the US forever if they were caught upon return ) . It explains why many Americans who don \u2019 t necessarily support wide-scale legalization of unauthorized immigrants think of DREAMers as \u201c good \u201d immigrants . And it explains why the DREAMers , themselves , have been able to stand up and advocate on their own behalf \u2014 because they \u2019 re demanding rights they \u2019 ve seen exercised by their peers .\nIt \u2019 s harder for people with US-born family members to \u201c get legal \u201d than it \u2019 s ever been\nThe average DACA recipient , according to a study conducted in August 2017 by Tom Wong of UC San Diego ( on behalf of a coalition of liberal and immigrant advocacy groups ) , entered the US at the age of six . The average DACA recipient today , according to that same survey , is now 25 . That means that many of the people who currently have protection from deportation under DACA have been in the country for 20 years .\nSimply in order to qualify for the program , DACA recipients have to have entered before 2007 \u2014 meaning even the least-settled DACA recipient has been in the US for a decade .\nThis , too , is unusual . In the past , people didn \u2019 t necessarily stay unauthorized ( much less vulnerable to deportation ) for 10 or 20 years at a time . It used to be possible for many unauthorized immigrants to \u201c get legal \u201d without leaving the US and trying to return ; it no longer is .\nBefore 1976 , immigrants from Latin America could apply to become legal permanent residents ( green card holders ) if they had children who had been born in the US \u2014 no matter how old those children were . ( According to Wong \u2019 s survey , 25 percent of DACA recipients have US-born children . ) Even if they were already living in the US as unauthorized immigrants , they \u2019 d be officially \u201c admitted \u201d to the country once their applications were approved .\nThe 1976 law forced parents of US citizens to wait to apply for green cards until the child had turned 21 . But even then , says Charles Kamasaki of UnidosUS ( formerly the National Council on La Raza ) , \u201c there was a largely informal \u2014 but , I think , largely followed \u2014 policy that parents of US citizens were generally deferred from deportation until they could adjust \u201d to permanent residency .\nThat all changed in 1996 . The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act ( IIRIRA ) forced people who had lived in the US as unauthorized immigrants to wait three or 10 years outside the US ( or even be barred permanently ) before being allowed to become legal immigrants . An immigrant with family in the US could try to get a waiver , but would still have to leave the US to do so \u2014 and if the waiver was denied , she \u2019 d be stuck outside the US for years .\nClarissa Martinez of UnidosUS describes it as a \u201c squeezing \u201d \u2014 \u201c not only are the possibilities narrower \u201d to immigrate legally , \u201c but you \u2019 re also getting the door slammed on any possibility of adjusting in the future . \u201d\nIf the chance of \u201c getting legal \u201d was something of a toss-up , it didn \u2019 t seem logical to take the risk .\nIt \u2019 s impossible to predict what would have happened had the 1996 law not passed . But under the laws that existed before 1996 , most current DACA recipients would have a path to legal status : either via their US-born children , their US-born spouses , or because they would have been able to \u201c get legal \u201d alongside their parents via the DREAMers \u2019 US-born younger siblings .\nRelated 9 things you need to know to understand DACA and the DREAMers\nIt \u2019 s the combination of settledness and the difficulty of getting legal that make DREAMers generationally unique in the history of US immigration policy . They \u2019 re far from the first immigrants in US history who \u2019 ve been totally excluded ( or all but excluded ) from legality . But for a family to go through a generational life-cycle without the opportunity to legalize as a family \u2014 that \u2019 s something else .\nThis is why DREAMers themselves tend to resist the talking point that their parents are to blame for bringing them to the US . It \u2019 s why they \u2019 ve often been just as concerned about the fate of their parents and relatives who didn \u2019 t qualify for DACA , who might have some other form of temporary protection or might not have any protections at all , as they are with their own political fortunes . And it \u2019 s why they \u2019 ve worried , even before losing DACA , that their official recognition by the government could put their parents in danger .\nLife without immigration status is hard and only getting harder\nSocially , unauthorized immigrants live alongside legal immigrants and US citizens . But the legal distinctions between them affect what they can do with their lives .\nThe reason that many DREAMers didn \u2019 t find out they were unauthorized until they were in their mid-teens is because it was then that their documented peers became able to do things they couldn \u2019 t , like drive , get after-school jobs , or apply for federal financial aid for college . In the working world , those distinctions become absolute .\nThis , too , is fairly recent . Kamasaki allows that you could say that until 1986 , when the Immigration Reform and Control Act ( IRCA , or the \u201c Reagan amnesty \u201d ) allowed employers to be penalized for hiring unauthorized immigrants , \u201c there was no practical consequence \u201d to being unauthorized \u2014 \u201c you didn \u2019 t have to have work authorization \u201d to work in practice .\nSince then , the federal government has worked to prevent people without immigration status from getting hired to begin with \u2014 the electronic screening system E-Verify isn \u2019 t mandatory , but many of the country \u2019 s biggest employers use it to check applicants \u2019 Social Security numbers . Unauthorized immigrants who work under-the-table , low-status jobs may well be qualified for better ones , but simply unable to get them .\nStates and the federal government have worked to tighten access to social services based on immigration status . Georgia has barred unauthorized immigrants from public colleges and universities .\nLife without immigration status isn \u2019 t just about opportunities denied \u2014 it \u2019 s about the risk of deportation . That risk , too , has grown over the past couple of decades . Relatively few unauthorized immigrants were rounded up and deported from within the US 20 years ago . After 9/11 and the creation of the Department of Homeland Security ( which spun off immigration enforcement in the US \u201c interior \u201d into its own agency with its own , politically appealing budget line ) , that number steadily rose with capacity to track down and deport hundreds of thousands of immigrants .\nThere have been other times in American history when unauthorized immigrants have been at substantial deportation risk : Operation Wetback during the 1950s , for example , or farmworkers in California during the 1970s .\nStanford \u2019 s Minian says that immigrants of that period had to create mental maps of where immigration agents might be from day to day and avoid them , with some afraid to leave their homes during the day \u2014 or even living in trees to avoid la migra .\n\u201c But then , the possibility of reentry was also much higher , \u201d she adds . \u201c If you got deported , you would probably just come back . And the meaning of deportation , in some ways , was n't the same , because few people had families . '' In other words , the risk was higher , but the consequences were less grave .\nThe immigrants protected by DACA , however , may have little beyond the US because policy has forced them to stay here . But it \u2019 s also forced them to stay on the margins \u2014 and made those margins a scarier and shadowier place to be than they were when the DREAMers arrived .\nDREAMers , many of whom grew up thinking of themselves as American , have produced a social movement .\nRealizing the truth about their immigration status meant becoming more acutely aware than their peers of the ways in which government shaped their lives , and what needed to change for them to achieve their potential . Realizing this while having been raised in the US , living among US citizens and speaking English , gave many of them the social capital to feel empowered to \u201c come out \u201d as unauthorized immigrants and demand their rights .\nIt \u2019 s not a coincidence that unauthorized immigrants have become more visible over the past decade , and that that movement \u2019 s been led by DREAMers . It \u2019 s not a coincidence that DREAMer-led organizations have been at the center of the immigrant-rights movement . President Barack Obama didn \u2019 t just implement DACA because the American public liked DREAMers ; he implemented it because he was under pressure from DREAMers and the groups who supported them .\nBut President Donald Trump was elected in part due to his promises to crack down on immigration . Instead it is those who want to see the program rolled back who have power , like Attorney General Jeff Sessions , tapped as the public face of the administration \u2019 s decision to set an end date for DACA , and senior adviser Stephen Miller .\nThe days before Sessions \u2019 s announcement made it clear just how embedded its recipients are in civil society . Universities , employers , churches , and local and state governments called on Trump to keep the program . He didn \u2019 t listen . Members of both parties warned him not to do it . He responded by trying to make it their problem to fix . Seventy percent of Americans told an NBC News poll they thought DACA should stay ; he listened to the other 28 percent .\nKilling DACA wouldn \u2019 t silence those voices . It wouldn \u2019 t necessarily force DREAMers back into the shadows . It wouldn \u2019 t undo all the gains that they \u2019 ve been able to accrue over the past half-decade .\nFor the next six months , the forces that amassed to save DACA from President Trump will turn their attention to Congress . They \u2019 ll push for a bill that will do what DACA never could : allow DREAMers to become fully legalized as immigrants in the US , and eventually become US citizens . They \u2019 ll continue to express their hope for a permanent solution .\nBut behind the lobbying and rallies , behind the tightly held optimism , will be a persistent and terrifying dread \u2014 that the alternative to success is something terrible .\nThe Trump administration has just stuck a huge question mark on DREAMers \u2019 place in civil society .\nThe employers who wanted DACA to remain wouldn \u2019 t be able to keep employing DREAMers when their work authorization expires \u2014 and now have six months to figure out how they might respond to that . DREAMers may no longer be able to justify paying tuition at those universities if they can \u2019 t work in the US after getting the degrees \u2014 over the next six months , they have to make decisions about their educational futures .\nAnd if the threat of losing DACA doesn \u2019 t necessarily force DREAMers to go back into the closet about their immigration status , it certainly offers a powerful incentive to them to keep quiet \u2014 even as the fight in Congress makes it more important than ever for them to speak up and galvanize the citizens they know to put pressure on their elected representatives .\nEliminating DACA would mean adding 800,000 more people to the most marginalized of immigrant groups \u2014 and eliminating it six months from now simply puts them on the waitlist .\nIt \u2019 s not a policy that makes sense if your goal is to reduce the size of the unauthorized workforce , or to make it easier to track down and deport \u201c bad hombres . \u201d\nIt is a policy that makes sense if you want to send a message : that growing up in the US and having ties here mean less than they ever have , and that the papers you hold or don \u2019 t have mean more .\nThat message won \u2019 t change the reality of who \u2019 s living in the US . But it will be inscribed in the choices that those who lose DACA make , every day , for the rest of their lives . And because they are , and remain , so embedded in American communities , those choices can \u2019 t help but reverberate into the collective fabric of American life as well .",

President Barack Obama didn\u2019t just implement DACA because the American public liked DREAMers; he implemented it because he was under pressure from DREAMers and the groups who supported them.\n\nBut President Donald Trump was elected in part due to his promises to crack down on immigration. Instead it is those who want to see the program rolled back who have power, like Attorney General Jeff Sessions, tapped as the public face of the administration\u2019s decision to set an end date for DACA, and senior adviser Stephen Miller.\n\nThe days before Sessions\u2019s announcement made it clear just how embedded its recipients are in civil society. Universities, employers, churches, and local and state governments called on Trump to keep the program. He didn\u2019t listen. Members of both parties warned him not to do it. He responded by trying to make it their problem to fix. Seventy percent of Americans told an NBC News poll they thought DACA should stay; he listened to the other 28 percent.\n\nKilling DACA wouldn\u2019t silence those voices. It wouldn\u2019t necessarily force DREAMers back into the shadows. It wouldn\u2019t undo all the gains that they\u2019ve been able to accrue over the past half-decade.\n\nFor the next six months, the forces that amassed to save DACA from President Trump will turn their attention to Congress. They\u2019ll push for a bill that will do what DACA never could: allow DREAMers to become fully legalized as immigrants in the US, and eventually become US citizens. They\u2019ll continue to express their hope for a permanent solution.\n\nBut behind the lobbying and rallies, behind the tightly held optimism, will be a persistent and terrifying dread \u2014 that the alternative to success is something terrible.\n\nThe Trump administration has just stuck a huge question mark on DREAMers\u2019 place in civil society.\n\nThe employers who wanted DACA to remain wouldn\u2019t be able to keep employing DREAMers when their work authorization expires \u2014 and now have six months to figure out how they might respond to that. DREAMers may no longer be able to justify paying tuition at those universities if they can\u2019t work in the US after getting the degrees \u2014 over the next six months, they have to make decisions about their educational futures.\n\nAnd if the threat of losing DACA doesn\u2019t necessarily force DREAMers to go back into the closet about their immigration status, it certainly offers a powerful incentive to them to keep quiet \u2014 even as the fight in Congress makes it more important than ever for them to speak up and galvanize the citizens they know to put pressure on their elected representatives.\n\nEliminating DACA would mean adding 800,000 more people to the most marginalized of immigrant groups \u2014 and eliminating it six months from now simply puts them on the waitlist.\n\nIt\u2019s not a policy that makes sense if your goal is to reduce the size of the unauthorized workforce, or to make it easier to track down and deport \u201cbad hombres.\u201d\n\nIt is a policy that makes sense if you want to send a message: that growing up in the US and having ties here mean less than they ever have, and that the papers you hold or don\u2019t have mean more.\n\nThat message won\u2019t change the reality of who\u2019s living in the US. But it will be inscribed in the choices that those who lose DACA make, every day, for the rest of their lives. And because they are, and remain, so embedded in American communities, those choices can\u2019t help but reverberate into the collective fabric of American life as well.",
