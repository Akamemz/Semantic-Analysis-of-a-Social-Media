    "content": "It may not be a pardon . But the Justice Department has dropped charges against Donald Trump \u2019 s former national security adviser Michael Flynn , who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI .\nRetired Army Lt. Gen. Flynn , an important figure in the war on terror who gave Trump \u2019 s 2016 run military validation , will avoid prison time after the Justice Department provided a deliverance on Thursday that Flynn had long sought . It is also the second redemption that Trump has provided the general , who served as his first national security adviser for less than a month .\n\u201c The Government has determined , pursuant to the Principles of Federal Prosecution and based on an extensive review and careful consideration of the circumstances , that continued prosecution of this case would not serve the interests of justice , \u201d wrote Timothy Shea , the interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia and a former senior aide to Attorney General William Barr . Shortly before the filing , lead prosecutor Brandon Von Grack abruptly withdrew from the case .\nThe Justice Department filing , in essence , portrays Flynn as the victim of an FBI frame-up job , and his lies to the FBI as legally marginal . Shea wrote that Flynn \u2019 s lies needed to have been \u201c not simply false , but \u2018 materially \u2019 false with respect to a matter under investigation. \u201d Later in the filing , Shea referred to those lies as \u201c gaps in [ Flynn \u2019 s ] memory , \u201d rather than deliberate falsehoods Flynn conceded .\n\u201c Even if he told the truth , Mr. Flynn \u2019 s statements could not have conceivably \u2018 influenced \u2019 an investigation that had neither a legitimate counterintelligence nor criminal purpose , \u201d Shea wrote .\nIt was an astonishing turnaround since 2018 , when a federal judge said to Flynn in a sentencing hearing , \u201c arguably , you sold your country out. \u201d That judge , Emmet Sullivan , could still decide to reject Shea \u2019 s filing and continue with Flynn \u2019 sentencing . Michael Bromwich , a former federal prosecutor and Justice Department inspector general , tweeted that the extraordinary move represented \u201c a pardon by another name \u201d and called it a \u201c black day in DOJ history . \u201d\nRep. Jerrold Nadler ( D-NY ) , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , said the decision to drop charges was \u201c outrageous \u201d and revealed \u201c a politicized and thoroughly corrupt Department of Justice. \u201d Sen. Ron Wyden ( D-OR ) added , \u201c If Barr \u2019 s Justice Department will drop charges against someone who twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and who the White House publicly fired for lying to the vice president , there \u2019 s nothing it won \u2019 t do , no investigation it won \u2019 t taint . \u201d\nNeither Flynn nor his attorney , Sidney Powell , responded immediately to requests for comment .\nSpeaking to reports on Thursday afternoon , Trump said he had no prior knowledge of the Justice Department \u2019 s decision . \u201c He was an innocent man , \u201d Trump said , of Flynn . \u201c Now in my book he \u2019 s an even greater warrior . \u201d\nThe dropped charges follow a years-long groundswell from Trump \u2019 s base , and particularly Fox News , to clear Flynn . His advocates claim that Flynn was set up by the same disreputable FBI figures who they believe persecuted Trump over phantom collusion with Russia .\nFlynn \u2019 s guilty plea , in December , 2017 , has been no obstacle to the narrative , particularly since Flynn sought afterwards , unsuccessfully , to withdraw his plea . His sentencing , initially set for February , had also been delayed .\nLast month , agitation for a Flynn pardon intensified after documents emerged from two of Trump \u2019 s most hated ex-FBI figures , counterintelligence official Peter Strzok and attorney Lisa Page , discussing Flynn \u2019 s fateful January 2017 interview with the FBI . Page asked when and how to \u201c slip it in \u201d to Flynn that lying to an FBI agent is a crime , something that Flynn \u2019 s advocates believed showed the general being railroaded from the start .\nBut veteran FBI agents and prosecutors have pointed out that the FBI is not legally obligated to inform an interview subject that lying to them is illegal . \u201c Michael Flynn was very familiar with the FBI , \u201d said Stephanie Douglas , a former executive assistant director of the FBI \u2019 s National Security Branch . \u201c He would certainly have been aware of his obligation to provide candid and truthful information . His claim he was tricked and manipulated doesn \u2019 t sound valid to me . \u201d\nShea , in his Thursday court filing , suggested the FBI officials were \u201c fishing for falsehoods merely to manufacture jurisdiction over any statement. \u201d In Shea \u2019 s view , Flynn \u2019 s lies were less germane to the prosecution than the FBI \u201c lack [ ing ] sufficient basis to sustain its initial counterintelligence investigation , \u201d and its pre-interview position that it ought to close the investigation before speaking with the then national security adviser .\nFormer FBI deputy head Andrew McCabe said on Thursday that the suggestion there was no reason to interview Flynn was \u201c patently false , and ignores the considerable national security risk his contacts raised. \u201d He said Flynn \u2019 s lies added to the FBI \u2019 s concerns about his relationship with Russia . \u201c Today \u2019 s move ... is pure politics designed to please the president , \u201d he added .\nU.S. Attorney Jeff Jensen , who was appointed by Barr to review Flynn \u2019 s and other high-profile cases , said on Thursday that he concluded \u201c the proper and just course \u201d was to dismiss the case . \u201c I briefed Attorney General Barr on my findings , advised him on these conclusions , and he agreed , \u201d he said .\nWhile serving as national security adviser , Flynn misled FBI interviewers about conversations he had with the then-Russian ambassador , Sergei Kislyak . In one of those late 2016 conversations , according to court filings , Flynn asked the Russians to avoid escalatory actions in response to sanctions and diplomatic expulsions then President Barack Obama enacted as reprisal for Russian electoral interference . Shea , in his filing , called Flynn \u2019 s Kislyak calls \u201c entirely appropriate on their face . \u201d\nThe national security adviser \u2019 s lies prompted the holdover attorney general , Sally Yates , to warn the White House that Flynn had given the Russians leverage to blackmail him .
