    "content": "When Matthew Maclaine arrived in Afghanistan \u2019 s Helmand Province with his scout sniper platoon in 2012 , it was a dream come true .\n\u201c It \u2019 s like playing in the Super Bowl \u201d for a Marine Corps infantryman , he says . \u201c You \u2019 ve been training for years and years to do this thing . Now you \u2019 re in combat , you \u2019 re here\u2014you \u2019 re in the big game . \u201d\nHis deployment was everything he hoped it would be , he says , culminating in a behind-enemy-lines mission when his sniper platoon inserted 12 hours before a major operation .\n\u201c Whenever you watch movies , snipers enter behind enemy lines , \u201d Mr. Maclaine says . \u201c But that almost never happens in real life . We were doing the sniper mission , \u201d providing reconnaissance and surveillance prior to the operation \u2019 s commencement .\nThe highlight was calling in a helicopter to extract his team from a mountaintop . \u201c We spent four days on top of this mountain and it was time to go , \u201d he says . \u201c It was the culmination of every skill that I had developed , and to take my team from a hostile environment to a safe one \u2013 that was the best feeling ever . \u201d\nIt was a satisfaction in sharp contrast to a rather different sort of hostile environment \u2013 his arrival at Saddleback College in Mission Viejo , Calif. , after four years in the Marines . He was \u201c just miserable , \u201d he says .\nHe recalls an early party he attended filled with \u201c high school drama , \u201d selfies , and social media . \u201c I was maybe four years older than some of them , but I felt really removed . They \u2019 re all taking selfies and posting on Instagram , and I \u2019 m thinking , \u2018 What am I doing here ? \u2019 \u201d\nIt is a feeling common among many troops . Only one quarter of post-9/11 veterans managed to attain a degree before blowing through their GI Bill benefits , according to a 2012 Census Bureau survey . Between 2003 and 2009 , the completion rate for bachelor \u2019 s degrees among veterans was roughly 10 percent , the United States Department of Education estimates .\nIn response , programs to help student veterans successfully transition to life on campus have begun to crop up nationwide . A college-immersion boot camp called the Warrior-Scholar Project , for example , has helped Mr. Maclaine stick it out at Saddleback despite at times feeling like more like a chaperone than a student .\nThere have been signs of success . After four summers of Warrior-Scholar programs , each of the 265 student-veteran participants who has started attending college has stayed with it .\nThe need is clear . Some 1 million troops interested in using their new GI Bill will leave military service \u2013 either by choice or as a result of post-war downsizing \u2013 between now and 2020 . That amounts to a national investment of some $ 30 billion . Two million veterans across the country are currently eligible for the program .\n\u201c The data is inconsistent , but none of it is good for veterans , \u201d says Sidney Ellington , the executive director of the Warrior-Scholar Project . \u201c So we \u2019 re trying to fill that gap , and enable these veterans to actually get something out of their GI Bill before it \u2019 s exhausted . \u201d\nThe one week program was first held on the campus of Yale University in 2012 with nine students . It now offers spots for 150 veterans a year at colleges including the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , Vassar , Syracuse , Cornell , and Georgetown University .\n\u201c I went through what amounts to three years of training before going to Afghanistan . Even though we \u2019 ve done what many may consider \u2018 harder things , \u2019 we were trained to do them . That \u2019 s what makes it manageable , \u201d Maclaine says . \u201c It \u2019 s naive to assume that veterans will do well just because they \u2019 re veterans . \u201d\nAfter serving as a Marine intelligence analyst on the ground in Libya during and following the fall of Muammar Qaddafi , former Marine Patrick Kane says that he was \u201c basically petrified \u201d early in his freshman year at Columbia University in 2014 .\n\u201c I was petrified of studying , petrified of asking questions , \u201d he says . \u201c I did n't know how to study , and so I didn \u2019 t study \u2013 it was the fear that if I did study , I wouldn \u2019 t get it . \u201d\nAfter his first semester , he enrolled at a Warrior-Scholar boot camp at Yale .\n\u201c They showed us how to study , and that \u2019 s where the confidence started to grow . Then it was about having the confidence to speak out , and feeling confident that you belong , \u201d Mr. Kane says .\nMaclaine took to the course at Yale back in 2013 . In the first three or four months Saddleback , \u201c I had two friends on campus , and they were more like acquaintances. \u201d But after he took the program , things changed .\nIt hammered \u201c the value of developing relationships outside of the ones I had before , \u201d Maclaine says . \u201c If you don \u2019 t develop relationships with people at school , you \u2019 re going to have a hard time . \u201d\nHe picked up some more basic skills , too , including training in \u201c how to use commas and write cohesive paragraphs\u2026 . I wouldn \u2019 t have gotten A \u2019 s otherwise , \u201d he says . \u201c I went into English and Algebra class and just crushed it \u2013 I destroyed those classes . \u201d\nThis training and camaraderie is particularly helpful when former troops also may be struggling with post-traumatic stress following their years of service , veterans say .\nHe enlisted in the Army in 2008 and became a medic , deploying to Iraq two weeks after completing his airborne training . It was on his third deployment , this time in Afghanistan , that a platoon leader in the unit he was attached to was shot .\nThey were calling for a medic as a more explosions erupted around them .\n\u201c I was able to get him behind a rock and treat him . \u201d\nAs he was carrying him to the landing zone to have him medically evacuated , however , Mr. Polk was injured , sustaining shrapnel in his side .\n\u201c I learned a lot about myself \u2013 what I can do , and what I can overcome. \u201d Getting out of the military was tough , however , and he went through a period where he imagined he would be a truck driver . \u201c I thought , \u2018 I can be alone , \u2019 \u201d Polk says .\nHe had been an extrovert , but his experience in the Army , and the dissolution of his marriage , changed that , he says . \u201c I didn \u2019 t have anyone to come home to \u2013 I was unhealthily reclusive . \u201d\nBut during an exit seminar from the Army , he learned about the Posse Veterans Program , launched in 2012 and now in three schools \u2013 Vassar , Wesleyan , and Dartmouth , which all pledge to supplement available GI Bill funding to guarantee full tuition for every student veteran that is accepted into the program .\nThrough his posse he met his good friend Malcolm , who picks him up and brings him to social events . \u201c I say , \u2018 I \u2019 ll go out because I know you . \u2019 \u201d\nSocial events made him wary . \u201c I was scared that they would ask stupid questions , or tell me that I was wrong for serving . \u201d\nPolk was also concerned that the \u201c pretty long beard \u201d he grew after he got out of the Army might be off-putting . \u201c I thought , best-case scenario , they might think I \u2019 m kind of creepy . \u201d\n\u201c Everyone I \u2019 ve talked to has been very open , not just asking questions because it \u2019 s fun , but because they just want the raw information of what happened. \u201d In the process he \u2019 s found that the first time he \u2019 s been able to talk openly about his experiences in combat , \u201c It \u2019 s been with 18-year-olds . \u201d\nWesleyan University in Connecticut currently has 20 military veterans as students on campus through the program .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve been engaged in a series of wars that have n't even been labeled wars , and they demand an enormous sacrifice from a very small percentage of the population , and the rest of us depend on that sacrifice whether we like it or not , but never really have to talk to somebody who patrolled the streets of Iraq or the mountains of Afghanistan , \u201d says Wesleyan University President Michael Roth .\n\u201c I thought this was a great thing \u2013 we \u2019 d both help deserving student veterans with financial assistance , and it would also be good for the campus because they would have a very different life experience from most of our other students , \u201d he adds . \u201c They \u2019 re a little bit older , more mature , and they are intensely curious about the world and about themselves . I think they want to make the most of their education , and they don \u2019 t take it for granted . There \u2019 s a kind of intensity to that that \u2019 s just great . \u201d\nThe insights that come through this passion have prompted a number of veterans to begin creating campus programs on their own .\nMatthew Gallaway chose to attend Northern Illinois University in 2014 after serving in the Navy . He was drawn back home by the Illinois Veterans Grant program , which covers tuition and fees for those who return to Illinois for college within six months of separating from the US military .\nHe found some helpful resources in place for veterans , including a lounge and a dedicated computer lab . But after attending a Student Veterans of America conference in San Antonio , Texas \u2013 the same year his university lost two student veterans to suicide \u2013 he met representatives from colleges with dedicated buildings that include counseling services , for example .\n\u201c It gave me an image of what a truly vet-friendly university looks like , \u201d he says . \u201c It \u2019 s motivated me to work towards making NIU a truly veteran-friendly university . \u201d\nHe started by taking over a building that used to be a fraternity house and making it into home for seven of his fellow student veterans . \u201c The residents are able to relax and have the mature discussions that younger students \u2013 your 18- or 19-year-old high school graduates \u2013 wouldn \u2019 t understand , \u201d he says .\nBut he recognizes , too , the importance of connecting veterans with the university community . Many student veterans at NIU join fraternities , he notes . \u201c They \u2019 re joining these fraternities , which are usually run by younger guys , and sharing their leadership , knowledge , and experience . \u201d\nRecently , the veterans house hosted a pig roast , inviting veterans along with sororities and fraternities down the road . Mr. Gallaway is also making efforts to connect student vets with the local Veterans of Foreign Wars and American Legion chapters . \u201c We want to give guys those social connections outside the university community , so they still have that community when they graduate . \u201d\nAs they become more involved in campus life , if reluctantly at first , veterans are finding that they reap the rewards . After his Warrior-Scholar boot camp , Maclaine decided to join student government .\nThat \u2019 s where he met his current girlfriend of two years , and went on to chair a veterans student committee where he was in charge of 15 undergraduates .\nHe recalls in particular a freshman named Lucy . \u201c When I interviewed her for my council I was intentionally gruff and intimidating \u2013 rightly or wrongly . I \u2019 d never interviewed someone before , and I wanted to see how she \u2019 d do under pressure . \u201d\nIn response , \u201c she sat up straight , she was authoritative in her speech , direct in her responses . \u201d\nShe had a plan to get things done , too , and as the year progressed , she became his most valuable asset on the student council .\n\u201c I saw this young woman have the sort of tenacity and resolve that I wouldn \u2019 t have seen in a first-year Marine , \u201d he says . \u201c That was inspiring . \u201d\nHe learned , too , from his first boss in the student government , who was 4 foot 11 . She was also a woman , and Maclaine admits that he was initially skeptical of this fact .\n\u201c I \u2019 d only ever worked with men , and that was weird for me .

It was on his third deployment, this time in Afghanistan, that a platoon leader in the unit he was attached to was shot.\n\nThey were calling for a medic as a more explosions erupted around them.\n\n\u201cI was able to get him behind a rock and treat him.\u201d\n\nAs he was carrying him to the landing zone to have him medically evacuated, however, Mr. Polk was injured, sustaining shrapnel in his side.\n\n\u201cI learned a lot about myself \u2013 what I can do, and what I can overcome.\u201d Getting out of the military was tough, however, and he went through a period where he imagined he would be a truck driver. \u201cI thought, \u2018I can be alone,\u2019 \u201d Polk says.\n\nHe had been an extrovert, but his experience in the Army, and the dissolution of his marriage, changed that, he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t have anyone to come home to \u2013 I was unhealthily reclusive.\u201d\n\nBut during an exit seminar from the Army, he learned about the Posse Veterans Program, launched in 2012 and now in three schools \u2013 Vassar, Wesleyan, and Dartmouth, which all pledge to supplement available GI Bill funding to guarantee full tuition for every student veteran that is accepted into the program.\n\nThrough his posse he met his good friend Malcolm, who picks him up and brings him to social events. \u201cI say, \u2018I\u2019ll go out because I know you.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSocial events made him wary. \u201cI was scared that they would ask stupid questions, or tell me that I was wrong for serving.\u201d\n\nPolk was also concerned that the \u201cpretty long beard\u201d he grew after he got out of the Army might be off-putting. \u201cI thought, best-case scenario, they might think I\u2019m kind of creepy.\u201d\n\nWhat he discovered, however, was very different.\n\n\u201cEveryone I\u2019ve talked to has been very open, not just asking questions because it\u2019s fun, but because they just want the raw information of what happened.\u201d In the process he\u2019s found that the first time he\u2019s been able to talk openly about his experiences in combat, \u201cIt\u2019s been with 18-year-olds.\u201d\n\nWesleyan University in Connecticut currently has 20 military veterans as students on campus through the program.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been engaged in a series of wars that haven't even been labeled wars, and they demand an enormous sacrifice from a very small percentage of the population, and the rest of us depend on that sacrifice whether we like it or not, but never really have to talk to somebody who patrolled the streets of Iraq or the mountains of Afghanistan,\u201d says Wesleyan University President Michael Roth.\n\n\u201cI thought this was a great thing \u2013 we\u2019d both help deserving student veterans with financial assistance, and it would also be good for the campus because they would have a very different life experience from most of our other students,\u201d he adds. \u201cThey\u2019re a little bit older, more mature, and they are intensely curious about the world and about themselves.
