And cheap is something that public policy \u2014 if it \u2019 s good , at least \u2014 usually is not .\nSo when you read this report from Pro Publica 's Sarah Smith , what it should tell you , as if you didn \u2019 t know already , is that the legislature in Wisconsin couldn \u2019 t care less when it comes to improving its elections . Because that is not what its voter ID law is about :\nOn April 5 , when voters cast ballots in Wisconsin \u2019 s Republican and Democratic primaries , the state \u2019 s controversial voter ID bill will face its biggest test since Governor Scott Walker signed it into law in 2011 . For the first time in a major election , citizens will be required to show approved forms of identification in order to vote . The law mandates that the state run a public-service campaign \u201c in conjunction with the first regularly scheduled primary and election \u201d to educate voters on what forms of ID are acceptable . But Wisconsin has failed to appropriate funds for the public education campaign . The result is that thousands of citizens may be turned away from the polls simply because they did not understand what form of identification they needed to vote .\nDoesn \u2019 t look too good for those who argue that , contrary to Democrats \u2019 claims , voter ID laws are not intended to suppress the Democratic vote , does it ? Well , it gets worse .\nBecause this isn \u2019 t a case of bureaucratic miscommunication ; this isn \u2019 t about the state government \u2019 s left hand not knowing what its right hand is doing . According to Smith \u2019 s reporting , the decision to provide a statewide education campaign with all of zero dollars was about as intentional-looking as it gets :\nWisconsin \u2019 s failure to fund these public-service ads comes after a clash between the Government Accountability Board , the nonpartisan agency responsible for producing voter education materials , and the Republican-controlled legislature . In October , the agency met with Republican State Senator Mary Lazich , who was a primary sponsor of the voter ID bill in 2011 , to inquire after funding and received a tepid response . The board told Lazich that it would need $ 300,000 to $ 500,000 from the state legislature to broadcast advertisements . The legislature had twice appropriated money for public information campaigns during the 2012 and 2014 election cycles , but the ads barely hit the airwaves before court injunctions delayed the law from going into effect . According to Kevin Kennedy , the board \u2019 s director and general counsel , Lazich thanked the board for the information , but didn \u2019 t make any promises . Lazich did not respond to requests for comment from ProPublica .\nIt gets better ( by which , again , I mean worse ) . Not only did Lazich essentially ghost the Government Accountability Board , but the board was unable to find some other ally in the legislature . Why ? Because the legislature was in the process of destroying the board altogether :\nAfter the meeting , the Government Accountability Board decided against making a formal funding request to the legislature , which had already introduced a bill to dismantle the agency . \u201c We weren \u2019 t sure we would have a receptive audience , \u201d Kennedy told ProPublica . Two days after the meeting , the Wisconsin Assembly voted to replace the nonpartisan board with two partisan agencies by the end of June 2016 . Since 2012 , Republicans have attacked the board after it investigated , among other things , whether Governor Walker coordinated with outside political groups during the recount battle that gripped the state . Judicial orders stalled the investigation , and the board eventually took itself out of the probe . Walker , cleared of wrongdoing , survived the scandal .\nThe whole thing is so shameless and tawdry , you could be forgiven for wanting to simply shake your head and think about something else . And if you did , you \u2019 d simply be following the state legislature \u2019 s lead .\nAfter all , it \u2019 s not like there \u2019 s a problem , here \u2014 at least as far as they see it . With anywhere between 200,000 to 350,000 Wisconsin citizens potentially facing disenfranchisement , according to Smith \u2019 s report , the voter ID law is on pace to work exactly as intended .
