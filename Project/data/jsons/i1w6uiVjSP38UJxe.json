    "content": "Following a few days of relative calm ( `` he 's finally pivoting ! `` ) , Donald Trump 's reckless and unthinking mouth dumped him right back into another campaign tempest on Tuesday . This time , the news cycle has been tipped upside-down by the GOP nominee 's alleged musings about somebody assassinating Hillary Clinton and/or her Supreme Court nominees , depending on varying interpretations . Here 's the clip in case you missed it , or have only read about it , followed by a few quick thoughts :\n( 1 ) Trump 's spokespeople initially could n't agree on whether or not he was actually discussing assassinations . One claimed that he was simply asserting such political killings could occur , not advocating that outcome . Another said it was a reference to `` Second Amendment folks '' exercising their right to vote , and nothing more . A third statement was a mishmash of nothingness , lacking any direct denial that he was talking about violence . Having watched the video , it seems likely to me that he was , in fact , referencing someone shooting public officials . The 'tell ' here is his lamentation that there would be 'nothing you could do about ' an adverse Second Amendment ruling . He 's talking about a hypothetical development that could only happen after Hillary won the election . Perhaps he was referring to guns rights advocates managing to block a nomination , but that 's a process argument that seems beyond his grasp . Watch it again ; the gentleman with a white beard sitting behind him mouths `` whoa '' right after the controversial line . At the very least , `` assassinations '' is how it played with at least part of the audience in the room . Here 's Trump 's own personal clean-up operation , for what it 's worth .\n( 2 ) All that being said , even within an assassination framework , it seems to me that the comment was obviously and at worst meant as a joking aside . The notion that it was intended as a bona fide threat or a call to violence is preposterous ; Trump is certainly not guilty of a crime , as some have hysterically suggested . ( The Secret Service says it is `` aware of '' the Republican nominee 's remark ) . Still , it should go without saying that it is absolutely inappropriate for a presidential candidate to casually refer to the assassination of his opponent , or her potential appointees . If a high-ranking Democrat had smirkingly said something similar about , say , President Bush or Justice Alito , the howls of conservative outrage would be deafening . Ask yourself : Would you accept Team Trump 's contradictory spin if it were being peddled by Team Obama ?\n( 3 ) Even if you do n't believe this joke was out of line , it was certainly really stupid . Donald Trump is losing this election because American voters do not believe he possesses the character or temperament that the presidency demands . Everyone knows this . The polling could not be any clearer . Yet his response to that urgent reality is to wander off script -- and there was a script for this speech -- with a gratuitous , inflammatory line that did n't even get a laugh .
