    "content": "A showdown behind closed doors on Capitol Hill could bring President Barack Obama closer to fulfilling one of his long-held campaign promises : closing the U.S. military prison for suspected terrorists at Guant\u00e1namo Bay , Cuba .\nAt issue are dueling approaches in the House and Senate versions of this year \u2019 s defense policy bill .\nOne , pushed by Obama \u2019 s 2008 Republican presidential rival , Sen. John McCain , would give the Obama administration a path that would force congressional review of a closure plan .\nThe other , backed by House Republicans stung by the president \u2019 s decision last year to swap five Guant\u00e1namo detainees for captive Army Sgt . Bowe Bergdahl without providing Congress the required 30-day notice , would strengthen restrictions on transferring detainees , making the closure of the facility more difficult in the waning months of Obama \u2019 s presidency .\nThe competing prescriptions are now being reconciled in backroom talks between congressional leaders and the chairmen of the Armed Services committees . The outcome of their wrangling is expected this week , with votes on a final National Defense Authorization Act expected ahead of the long summer congressional recess that begins in early August .\nNearly 800 prisoners have been held at Gitmo since early 2002 , according to the Congressional Research Service , but only 116 remain there today . In recent months , the administration has been trying to speed up the transfers to third countries of prisoners who \u2019 ve been cleared for release .\nA former prisoner of war and a long-time advocate of closing the prison , McCain is banking that his new stature as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee will finally give him momentum to achieve his and Obama \u2019 s goal . And the stakes for Obama couldn \u2019 t be higher for a pledge he made during his first week in office .\nThe Senate proposal would strengthen a number of restrictions on transferring prisoners to other countries or to the United States , but it also for the first time would offer the administration an escape ramp . If it submits a plan for closing the prison \u2014 and that plan were approved by Congress \u2014 then it could begin transferring prisoners to the U.S. for trial or incarceration .\nThe provision would represent a small shift on Capitol Hill and could pave the way for more sweeping changes in next year \u2019 s annual National Defense Authorization Act .\nThe White House has threatened to veto both the House and Senate versions of the defense bill over a number of objections , including the Guant\u00e1namo provisions , which it says are an infringement on executive power . And advocates pressing to shutter the prison say McCain \u2019 s plan is flawed when it comes to providing a path for closure \u2014 because the odds of Congress approving a proposal put forward by Obama are slim to none .\nStill , the Arizona senator \u2019 s proposal is \u201c our best legislative shot , \u201d said one U.S. official , speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss pending legislation .\nAnd House Armed Services Chairman Mac Thornberry , who spearheaded the more restrictive language in the House , says he \u2019 s willing to at least consider it .\n\u201c The president , if he can come up with an approach that can get support , then I don \u2019 t think anybody \u2019 s just pining to keep the detention facility open forever , \u201d the Texas Republican told reporters last month . \u201c But you \u2019 ve got ta get people \u2019 s support that you \u2019 ve got a handle on the issues related here , and he has not been able to do that . \u201d\nHuman-rights groups , though , aren \u2019 t satisfied and wish the president would be more aggressive in taking on Congress on the issue .\n\u201c Politically it looks good \u2014 it looks like it gives everyone a chance to participate in closing Guant\u00e1namo together , \u201d said Daphne Eviatar of Human Rights First . \u201c But , realistically , the politics are such that a lot of the Republicans , especially in the House , have been clear they \u2019 re not going to approve anything that the president puts forward in terms of closing Guant\u00e1namo . \u201d\nInstead , Eviatar suggested that Obama needs to follow through on his veto threat to leave open any chance of closing the prison .
