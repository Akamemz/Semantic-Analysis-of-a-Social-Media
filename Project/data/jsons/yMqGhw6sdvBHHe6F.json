    "content": "Is the Obamacare coalition finally cracking ? We ran through the Republican response to the law 's unraveling last night . Will Democrats bravely stand shoulder-to-shoulder amidst gale-force political headwinds ? Perhaps not . Behold , unusually pointed questions from a retiring Senate Democrat , speaking to the New York Times :\nSome Democrats were also dismayed by the White House \u2019 s actions . Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa , the chairman of the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions Committee and an author of the health law , questioned whether Mr. Obama had the authority to unilaterally delay the employer mandate . \u201c This was the law . How can they change the law ? \u201d he asked . For its part , the White House continued to look flat-footed on the issue . After an almost surreptitious evening announcement of the delay last week , posted on the Treasury Department \u2019 s Web site , the White House is declining to send a representative to a House hearing on the decision that is scheduled for Wednesday .\nWe 'll circle back to Harkin 's question in a moment , but take a moment to soak in the White House 's in-your-face attitude toward its own power grab . This administration has never masked its contempt for the other two co-equal branches of government , and this is just the latest middle finger directed at Congress . Hearings ? We do n't even recognize your damn hearings ! As for Harkin , he 's shocked -- shocked ! -- that President Obama seems to be issuing decrees from his throne , with little regard for the rule of law . `` This was the law . How can they change the law ? '' he asks , incredulous . Perhaps the Iowa Senator has sleep-walked through the last several years , during which this administration has engaged in selective enforcement of immigration laws , ceased defending an on-the-books marriage law in federal court ( prior to this decision ) , unlawfully re-wrote historic welfare reforms , made `` recess '' appointments when Congress was n't in recess , and trampled all over the First Amendment -- all to appease various political constituencies . Welcome to the program , Senator Harkin . Meanwhile , a respected former federal judge endeavors to answer Harkin 's question in the pages of the Wall Street Journal . Bottom line , Obama ca n't :\nPresident Obama 's decision last week to suspend the employer mandate of the Affordable Care Act may be welcome relief to businesses affected by this provision , but it raises grave concerns about his understanding of the role of the executive in our system of government . The Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel , which advises the president on legal and constitutional issues , has repeatedly opined that the president may decline to enforce laws he believes are unconstitutional . But these opinions have always insisted that the president has no authority , as one such memo put it in 1990 , to `` refuse to enforce a statute he opposes for policy reasons . '' Attorneys general under Presidents Carter , Reagan , both Bushes and Clinton all agreed on this point . With the exception of Richard Nixon , whose refusals to spend money appropriated by Congress were struck down by the courts , no prior president has claimed the power to negate a law that is concededly constitutional .\nIn 1998 , the Supreme Court struck down a congressional grant of line-item veto authority to the president to cancel spending items in appropriations . The reason ? The only constitutional power the president has to suspend or repeal statutes is to veto a bill or propose new legislation . Writing for the court in Clinton v. City of New York , Justice John Paul Stevens noted : `` There is no provision in the Constitution that authorizes the president to enact , to amend , or to repeal statutes . '' The employer mandate in the Affordable Care Act contains no provision allowing the president to suspend , delay or repeal it . Section 1513 ( d ) states in no uncertain terms that `` The amendments made by this section shall apply to months beginning after December 31 , 2013 . ''\n`` Shall apply . '' Obama 's new and illegitimate arrogation of power will surely snake its way through the courts , and by the time the matter 's settled , he 'll be coasting toward a very comfortable retirement . In the meantime , liberals ' desperation is laid bear . Matt Yglesias is mindlessly slandering conservatives as racist for having the temerity to point out that the president has a history of selectively enforcing laws , while Chuck Todd and Greg Sargent are muttering about Republicans ' `` sabotage governing . '' Sargent cites two primary examples , one of which he borrows from Todd . The first is the sequester , which somehow has n't reduced America to a post-apocalyptic dystopia just yet . In fact , things seem pretty stable , and the White House 's feverish warnings have been exposed as rank fear-mongering . Sargent fails to mention that these ( admittedly ham-fisted ) spending reductions were the White House 's idea in the first place , and that the president has threatened to veto legislation that would afford him the flexibility to mitigate the relatively minimal resulting pain . But their big 'gotcha ' is Obamacare , where Todd and Sargent are very upset that Republicans are n't helping Democrats implement a law that was jammed down the country 's collective throat , against the public 's wishes . Sabotage ! Let 's review a few facts : Democrats -- and only Democrats -- crafted , advocated , voted for , and signed this law . Whether they like it or not , they own every part of it . If the Left thinks the `` Republican obstructionism '' card will suddenly become an effective rhetorical tool in the Obamacare fight , they 're delusional .
