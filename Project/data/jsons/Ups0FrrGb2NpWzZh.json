And to run a presidential campaign \u2014 or to run a White House \u2014 he \u2019 s eventually going to need those .\nA brief timeline of how Beto O \u2019 Rourke talks about Medicare-for-all\nHere \u2019 s a bit of a timeline from what I \u2019 ve been able to piece together of O \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s views on Medicare-for-all , looking at the statements he \u2019 s made and interviews he \u2019 s done over the past year and a half :\nJune 15 , 2017 : Writes a Facebook post that says , \u201c A single-payer Medicare-for-all program is the best way to ensure all Americans get the healthcare they need . \u201d\nJune 17 , 2017 : Writes a much longer Facebook post saying , \u201c We need a single-payer health care system for all Americans , \u201d but that he wouldn \u2019 t co-sponsor the House bill for single-payer health care because it excluded for-profit providers from participating in the system .\nSeptember 20 , 2017 : Tells the Texas Observer that he likes the Sanders bill but says he disagrees with the lack of copays and premiums for all Americans . He \u2019 d prefer that Americans kick in something .\nSeptember 23 , 2017 : Speaking at an event at the University of Texas , O \u2019 Rourke outlines a four-step plan for getting to universal coverage . Step one is keeping Obamacare , step two is expanding Medicaid in all 50 states , step three is a public option , and step four is something similar to Sanders \u2019 s Medicare-for-all bill .\n\u201c If we could get to the last step tomorrow , I would take it in a second , \u201d O \u2019 Rourke said at that event . \u201c It \u2019 s important to both be as idealistic and describe as accurately as you can the vision , the goal we want to get to , and then be pragmatic about what it \u2019 s going to take to get there . \u201d\nOctober 9 , 2017 : Jeff Stein ( then a reporter at \u2588\u2588\u2588 , now at the Washington Post ) asks O \u2019 Rourke if he would support the Sanders bill should he win his Senate race in Texas . \u201c The answer is yes , I would , \u201d O \u2019 Rourke tells him .\nNovember 6 , 2017 : O \u2019 Rourke does an interview with the Young Turks where he talks about how to get to universal coverage . \u201c I \u2019 m not an expert on this by any means , but the only way I understand is to have some kind of a single-payer model , \u201d O \u2019 Rourke says . \u201c And the best one going in the United States now is Medicare. \u201d He goes on to talk about the possibility of starting with a Medicare buy-in that would eventually transition to a full single-payer system .\nMarch 16 , 2018 : O \u2019 Rourke tells Bill Maher that health care is his No . 2 policy priority .\n\u201c Universal health care , the ability for everyone to see a doctor regardless of income , \u201d he tells Maher .\n\u201c If that \u2019 s how we get there , that \u2019 s how we get there , \u201d O \u2019 Rourke responds , which Maher notes is \u201c a big if . \u201d\nJuly 14 , 2018 : A Politico story notes that O \u2019 Rourke \u201c no longer uses phrases like \u2018 single-payer \u2019 or \u2018 Medicare for all , \u2019 \u201d instead replacing those with \u201c universal , guaranteed , high-quality health care for all . \u201d\nJanuary 18 , 2018 : O \u2019 Rourke posts a campaign video where he talks a bit more about his vision : \u201c What \u2019 s my vision ? Universal health care and very likely that will involve some form of a single-payer system . Some expansion of Medicare , perhaps from where it is right now at 65 all the way down to zero . Or I \u2019 m open , if somebody has a better way to do this , including especially Republicans , I \u2019 m open to their vision of how to get there. \u201d He then goes on to talk about adding Medicare to the marketplace as a public option as \u201c a step we can take on the road to getting to universal health care . \u201d\nDecember 19 , 2018 : The Associated Press reports , \u201c O \u2019 Rourke has endorsed single-payer health care but says he doesn \u2019 t support \u2018 Medicare-for-all \u2019 because expanding the program could adversely affect current recipients . \u201d\nI \u2019 ve reached out to O \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s campaign to ask where he currently stands on Medicare-for-all , and will update this story if I get more information . However , he did talk a bit about Medicare-for-all in Iowa Thursday , and seemed to shy away from the label .\n@ BetoORourke didn \u2019 t embrace the Medicare4All label , suggested a single payer system isn \u2019 t politically possible in near term . \u201c I \u2019 m convinced we will have to work from as much common ground as possible . No 1 person or 1 political party can force the decision on this. \u201d # iacaucus https : //t.co/ovP5vIvEud \u2014 O. Kay Henderson ( @ okayhenderson ) March 14 , 2019\nGenerally , these statements seem to tell the story of him starting as a Medicare-for-all supporter but then slowly backing away from the label , instead talking more about a universal coverage system that might be single-payer or might be something else .\nThis primary is heavy on policy . So far , O \u2019 Rourke isn \u2019 t .\nThis is the fourth election cycle I \u2019 ve covered as a journalist and by far the one that is heaviest on policy . Part of that seems to owe to the fact that we have a Democratic primary field dominated by Senators , the type of people who are constantly engaged with creating and pushing new policy ideas .\nIn the runup to 2020 , we \u2019 ve seen Democrats rolling out one ambitious policy proposal after another \u2014 all attempting to put forward a signature idea that might catch fire with the base ( much in the same way Sanders \u2019 s Medicare-for-all idea has ) . Before Cory Booker launched his presidential bid , he rolled out an ambitious plan to give all American kids money from the government in an attempt to reduce the racial wealth gap . Elizabeth Warren preceded her announcement with a plan to have the federal government manufacture generic drugs . Kamala Harris , meanwhile , went with a plan to alleviate poverty that gives billions to low-income Americans .\nBut O \u2019 Rourke doesn \u2019 t have a signature policy \u2014 he has a signature style . He listens , and he talks a lot about his vision without giving a clear sense of how to get there .\nEven on a key policy like Medicare-for-all , one that will no doubt be debated aggressively this primary , he doesn \u2019 t really articulate a clear vision for how he would handle that issue . This has its benefits . Medicare-for-all is inherently a legislative idea that would have to go through compromise and negotiation , and flip tough votes . And who knows , maybe he \u2019 ll come up with one soon !\nBut for now , Beto is entering the race without clearly stating his view of what a health care system ought to look like \u2014 a view that lots of other candidates are bringing to the table .",
