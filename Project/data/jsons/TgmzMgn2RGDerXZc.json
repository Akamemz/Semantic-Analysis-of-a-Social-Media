He said the U.S. would not hesitate to sanction other countries that support North Korea's illegal efforts to develop nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, adding that he looked forward to further action by China, North Korea's patron.\n\nHours later, North Korean ballistic missile test failed on takeoff early Saturday, the second straight failure this month, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported.\n\nPresident Trump told Reuters Thursday that a \"major, major conflict\" with North Korea is a possibility for the U.S., but the White House is trying to come up with diplomatic solutions.\n\nHere are some of those possible solutions:\n\nReport: Trump warns of 'major, major conflict' with North Korea\n\nEnforce current sanctions\n\nTighten enforcement of existing U.N. Security Council sanctions. The latest sanctions resolution passed by world powers in November was touted as the strongest ever, but the State Department and analysts say those measures have yet to be fully enforced.\n\nThe sanctions limit North Korea\u2019s sale of conventional weapons, coal and iron ore, especially if revenue would benefit its nuclear or ballistic missile programs.\n\n\u201cChina and other countries in Africa and Southeast Asia are plainly not implementing all these sanctions,\u201d said Anthony Ruggiero, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a think tank in Washington.\n\nSome of those countries need help from the West to screen for complicated financial arrangements designed to hide North Korean involvement, and others are simply not interested in implementing the sanctions because they benefit from cut-rate North Korean pricing, Ruggiero said.\n\nUN security council strengthens North Korea sanctions\n\nStop Chinese missile carriers\n\nThe U.S. could start publicly calling out companies involved in North Korea's weapons programs, such as two Chinese trucking companies that provided or helped build large vehicles that North Korea uses to transport, erect and launch its missiles, said Richard Fisher, a China and Korea analyst at the International Assessment and Strategy Center.\n\nThe China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation and the China National Heavy Duty Truck Group or Sinotruk, have provided trucks or large missile carriers that North Korea uses to transport missiles aimed at U.S. forces in Asia, Fisher said.

Those substances have civilian as well as military uses, but together indicate an effort to produce lithium 6 for weapons, according to the ISIS report.\n\nThat means the Chinese government approved the transfer of technology to manufacture thermonuclear weapons to North Korea, Fisher said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simply inconceivable that the Chinese government would have allowed the transfer of this kind of technology without multi-level approval up to the Chinese Communist Party politburo,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly when these leaders are identified and given the international opprobrium they deserve will they even bother to consider changing their policies.\u201d\n\nImpose tougher U.N. sanctions\n\nTillerson is exploring whether Security Council members are willing to tighten North Korea sanctions even more, according to the State Department.\n\nThe November Security Council sanctions resolution \u201ccalls upon\u201d the international community to \u201cexercise vigilance\u201d over North Korean activities that produce revenue for the regime and its weapons program. Among these are workers sent by North Korea abroad to earn hard currency used for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, according to the Security Council.\n\nThis \u201cslave labor,\u201d Ruggiero said, has been used to build World Cup facilities in Qatar and St. Petersburg, Russia, in the Russian logging industry, and in Kuwait, and generates $500 million annually for North Korea.\n\nTillerson should seek a change to the resolution's permissive language to an outright ban, Ruggiero said.

The Trump administration could develop a multi-national coalition to cut off revenue to the North Korean government, like the Obama administration did to counter Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies should issue arrest warrants for senior company officers in China and other countries who participate in military assistance programs that benefit North Korea, and seize their assets, Fisher said.\n\nThey could start with targeting individuals, companies and financial institutions who did business with the Dandong Hongxiang Industrial Development Company, a Chinese firm named in U.S. sanctions issued in September, or citizens of China, Russia, Vietnam and Cuba who worked with North Koreans named in sanctions issued on March 31.
