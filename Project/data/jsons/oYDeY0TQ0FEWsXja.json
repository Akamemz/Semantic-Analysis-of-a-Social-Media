    "content": "Marie Yovanovitch , the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who was recalled this past May , became teary-eyed as she recounted her sudden firing during a closed-door deposition last month , sources told Fox News .\nOn Friday morning at 9 a.m . ET , the 60-year-old diplomat will take the stand again for Day Two of the public impeachment hearings against President Trump -- and Republicans are set to hammer her with an aggressive cross-examination related to her previous statements under oath , as well as her reported role in shielding a George Soros-linked nonprofit allegedly connected to documented Ukrainian election interference efforts .\n\u201c The former ambassador from the United States , the woman , was bad news , \u201d was how Trump described Yovanovitch to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 phone call .\n\u201c She \u2019 s going to go through some things , \u201d the president added ominously .\n\u201c The former ambassador from the United States , the woman , was bad news . She \u2019 s going to go through some things. \u201d \u2014 President Trump\nShortly before Yovanovitch was set to take the stand , Fox News contributor John Solomon published an explosive March interview with Yuriy Lutsenko , a former prosecutor general in Ukraine . Lutsenko claimed that Yovanovitch had given him a \u201c do not prosecute \u201d list \u2014 and Solomon reported that Yovanovitch pressured Ukrainian prosecutors to back off a case involving the AntiCorruption Action Centre , funded by Soros , the liberal megadonor .\nThe U.S. Embassy under Yovanovitch , Solomon reported , also influenced Ukraine to drop prosecution against top law enforcement official Artem Sytnyk , who was singled out by a Ukrainian court for leaking damaging information about Paul Manafort , then Trump 's campaign chairman , to help Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election . Ukraine courts have ruled that the Manafort financial disclosures constituted illegal election meddling .\nUkraine systematically worked behind the scenes to boost Clinton , Politico has reported . On his call with Zelensky in July , Trump specifically asked his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate reports that Ukraine had some involvement in 2016 election interference , before he mentioned taking a look at Joe Biden 's business dealings in the country .\nThough multiple reports , including one from The Associated Press , indicated Lutsenko had recanted his claims about Yovanovitch , Lutsenko said he had not -- a revelation later confirmed by The New York Times .\nOn Friday and beyond , House Republicans plan to sharpen their focus on allegations of Ukraine meddling in the 2016 presidential election , voicing frustration after top diplomats who testified Wednesday said they had no knowledge of the issue . A senior Republican official told Fox News on Thursday that the issue of Ukrainian election meddling would be a \u201c theme \u201d of questions asked by GOP members of the House Intelligence Committee moving forward .\nUKRAINE MEDDLING TO BE KEY GOP FOCUS MOVING FORWARD , AFTER WITNESSES APPEARED NOT TO KNOW ABOUT IT\nMaking matters more complicated for Democrats , Yovanovitch 's testimony was set to come just hours after a bombshell report that a top Ukrainian official said Thursday that U.S . Ambassador Gordon Sondland , a key Democrat impeachment witness , `` did not link financial military assistance to a request for Ukraine to open up an investigation into former vice president and current Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son , Hunter Biden . ''\nCiting that report in a tweet late Thursday , Trump called the impeachment probe `` dead . ''\nSondland has testified that Trump explicitly told him there were `` no quid pro quos of any kind '' with Ukraine , including one in which military aid would be conditioned on any politically motivated investigations . ( Sondland later amended his testimony , claiming his recollection had been `` refreshed , '' to say he had come to `` understand '' from other sources that Trump wanted Ukraine to issue an `` anti-corruption statement . '' )\nForced out of her job in April , Yovanovitch likely ca n't offer much of substance on her own about the central allegations against the president . Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry contend that several months later in the year , Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate the Bidens , and withheld U.S. military aid as leverage .\nThe timeline will render Yovanovitch vulnerable to the same criticisms that Republicans had for William Taylor and George Kent , the two diplomats who testified during Day One of the impeachment proceedings : That all she can offer is unverifiable hearsay and speculation .\nAdditionally , Republican lawmakers have argued that Yovanovitch was n't entirely truthful in her previous remarks under oath . She communicated via her personal email account with a Democratic congressional staffer concerning a `` quite delicate '' and `` time-sensitive '' matter -- just two days after the whistleblower complaint that kickstarted the impeachment inquiry was filed , and a month before the complaint became public , emails exclusively obtained by Fox News showed .\nThe emails appear to contradict Yovanovitch 's deposition on Capitol Hill last month , in which she told U.S. Rep. Lee Zeldin , R-N.Y. , about an email she received Aug. 14 from the staffer , Laura Carey -- but indicated under oath that she never responded to it .\n`` I specifically asked her whether the Democratic staffer was responded to by Yovanovitch or the State Department , '' Zeldin told Fox News . `` It is greatly concerning that Ambassador Yovanovitch did n't answer my question as honestly as she should have , especially while under oath . ''\nYovanovitch 's colleagues , for their part , have said she was the target of a smear campaign by the White House , and Trump himself has called the diplomat `` bad news . ''\nSeparately during her remarks , Yovanovitch outlined how she lost her job in Ukraine , even as she remains an employee of the State Department .\n\u201c You \u2019 re going to think that I \u2019 m incredibly naive , \u201d Yovanovitch told impeachment investigators . \u201c But I couldn \u2019 t imagine all the things that have happened over the last six or seven months .
