    "content": "Nearly half of GOP insiders in key battleground states \u2014 many of whom will be in attendance \u2014 believe there \u2019 s a good chance violence will break out around next week \u2019 s Republican National Convention in Cleveland .\nThat \u2019 s according to The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Caucus : a panel of swing-state operatives , activists and strategists . Forty-eight percent of Republican insiders said the odds are high that there will be violence at the convention that is likely to nominate Donald Trump , compared with 52 percent who thought the convention would be a mostly peaceful affair .\n\u201c Given the tenor of the campaign trail so far this year , coupled with rising social unrest , it is bound to spill over , \u201d said one Iowa Republican , who , like all respondents , completed the survey anonymously . \u201c It 's really more a matter of how bad it will get . \u201d\n\u201c The reaction and counter-reaction to the resurgent identity politics gripping the country \u2019 s politics make at least some clashes and mayhem a near certainty , \u201d added a North Carolina Republican .\nFor the GOP insiders most concerned about violence in Cleveland , many cited protest groups tied to liberal causes , like the Black Lives Matter movement . Nearly a half-dozen Republicans mentioned the Hungarian-born billionaire George Soros , who is a prolific donor to liberal causes . But few thought violence would ensue from an effort to fight Trump \u2019 s nomination on the convention floor .\n\u201c It \u2019 s simply too big of a target for the malcontents and violent left to miss , \u201d said an Iowa Republican . \u201c George Soros \u2019 money will pay for thousands of disaffected screaming thugs . Think Seattle [ 1999 ] , Chicago 1968 . Riots and looting . They are the tools of the liberal left . \u201d\n\u201c I say this with no joy whatsoever , \u201d a Republican in the host state of Ohio added , \u201c but the far-left agitators in Cleveland will make the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago look like a fourth-grade slap fight . \u201d\n\u201c Cleveland is a rough town in the first place , \u201d added another Iowa Republican , who warned against the \u201c professional lefty protesters and anarchists \u201d in town for the convention . \u201c [ G ] iven the mood of the country the last three weeks , someone is gon na get hurt . \u201d\nMost of the Republicans who think the convention will be mostly peaceful said law enforcement would have things under control , and the shootings in Dallas last week that killed five police officers would temper any kind of violent protests .\n\u201c I am in Cleveland as I write this , \u201d said a Colorado Republican . \u201c Could there be some violence ? Sure . But the protesters I \u2019 ve seen ( and interacted with ) are paid . They have been flown here by organizations looking to foment unrest . At the end of the day , most of them are college kids who won \u2019 t have an appetite for an actual confrontation with the considerable law enforcement presence here . \u201d\nAdded a New Hampshire Republican : \u201c Cops getting shot has a chilling effect on those who might have thought about aggressive protesting . \u201d\nWhile most of the Republicans who were worried about violence placed the blame on protesters whom they mostly dismissed , a number did say that Trump bears some responsibility for the threats of tumult in Cleveland . One Michigan Republican said Trump \u201c invites violence. \u201d A Pennsylvania Republican said he \u201c invites chaos . \u201d\n\u201c Tensions are high , \u201d added an Ohio Republican . \u201c Trump is explosive . \u201d\nSwing-state polls this week are all over the map , but insiders in those Electoral College battlegrounds say they still trust the public pollsters to get it right much of the time .\nSixty-eight percent of insiders from both parties said the public polling in their state is mostly accurate . Just 32 percent said those public surveys are not very accurate .\nStill , there are important differences from state to state , and the comments from insiders in a number of the Caucus states were instructive :\nIn Colorado , one Democrat cast doubt on a Monmouth University poll released earlier this week : \u201c [ Hillary ] Clinton is up 13 points in a Monmouth poll out this week ; that seems ambitious . We think she is up by 5-6 points and still needs to work hard to maintain a winning margin. \u201d ( An NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll out Friday , after our Caucus participants had filed their responses , showed Clinton \u2019 s lead at 8 points . )\nMultiple Republicans in Florida said a Quinnipiac University poll this week showing Trump with a 3-point lead seems overly optimistic for the presumptive GOP nominee . Two Republicans volunteered that they thought the poll is an \u201c outlier . \u201d\n\u201c My state is particularly complicated to poll , and most outside groups aren \u2019 t careful enough with subgroups and regional breaks , which is why public polls are all over the place , \u201d added a Florida Democrat . \u201c I wish they \u2019 d ban the damn things . \u201d\nNevada is one of the hardest states to poll , according to insiders in both parties .\nSeventy percent of the voters \u201c are in one county , and that county has the highest cellphone-only rate in the country , \u201d said one Republican there . \u201c The place is dotted with big employment centers that operate 24 hours a day , so there is n't a good time to call to reach a considerable demographic . \u201d\nA Democrat cited Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid \u2019 s relatively easy victory over Republican Sharron Angle in 2010 , despite entering Election Day with a small deficit in the polls . \u201c Polling in Nevada is notorious for sucking , \u201d the Democrat said .\nAnother Democrat said the state is \u201c hard to poll \u201d but added that this week \u2019 s Monmouth University poll showing Clinton with a 4-point lead was \u201c in line with private polling , both statewide and in key congressional and state legislative districts . She \u2019 s down a bit thanks to the FBI announcement , but she \u2019 s maintaining a narrow lead . \u201d\nNew Hampshire insiders noted the state is polled frequently , but an academic pollster there cautioned against leaning on polls this early for predictive value .\n\u201c Real people have real lives that don \u2019 t revolve around politics , \u201d the pollster said . \u201c I \u2019 ve been an academic pollster for 30 years , and it never fails to make me chuckle how the media pay attention to summertime polls . Just plain silly ! \u201d\nThe Marquette Law School poll in Wisconsin was praised by insiders in both parties . One Democrat said it \u201c has been eerily accurate in recent elections , and [ I ] believe it is again . Charles Franklin and his team have the state down . \u201d\nMarquette and Franklin are \u201c the gold standard , \u201d added a Wisconsin Republican . \u201c Polls that are done by third-party groups have to stack up to the [ Marquette ] poll . \u201d\nThese are the members of The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Caucus , not all of whom participated in this survey :\nColorado : Ryan Call , Laura Carno , Matt Chandler , Will Coyne , Adam Eichberg , Mark Ferrandino , Cole Finegan , Michael Fortney , Andrew Freedman , Ted Harvey , Craig Hughes , Owen Loftus , Pete Maysmith , Frank McNulty , Karen Middleton , Christopher Murray , BJ Nikkel , Josh Penry , Rick Ridder , Alan Salazar , Janice Sinden , Pat Steadman , Pat Waak , Steve Welchert , Taylor West , Roxane White , Rob Witwer\nFlorida : Fernand Amandi , Scott Arceneaux , JP Austin , Tim Baker , Dennis K.
