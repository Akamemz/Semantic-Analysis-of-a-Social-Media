    "content": "( CNN ) The U.N. Security Council is set to implement `` significant '' punitive measures after North Korea 's nuclear test and will begin working on a new resolution `` immediately , '' a statement released by Security Council President Elbio Rosselli says .\nAfter Wednesday 's meeting , the council , which includes China , Russia and the United States , together condemned the test as a `` clear violation of ( past ) resolutions ... and of the nonproliferation regime . ''\nAlong with `` strongly condemning '' the test , members of the council determined to create a resolution that acts on previous promises to further curb the reclusive state 's ability to further its nuclear weapons program .\nThe 15-member U.N. Security Council held a closed-door meeting Wednesday geared to preventing Pyongyang from getting more nuclear weapons and punishing it for the test earlier that day .\nPast U.N. measures included arms , nonproliferation and luxury good embargoes , a freeze on overseas financial assets and a travel ban . None of them have so far stopped North Korea from continuing its nuclear program\nMeanwhile , U.S. President Barack Obama spoke to the leaders of South Korea and Japan , who both joined the President in condemning the act . Obama reaffirmed the United States ' defense commitments to both of its regional allies .\nSouth Korean President Park Geun-hye 's office added that the two leaders agreed `` there should be a corresponding price for this nuclear test . ''\nNorth Korea bragged Wednesday about the `` spectacular success '' of its first hydrogen bomb test , a defiant act that leader Kim Jong Un , in a statement read on state television , said would `` make the world ... look up to our strong nuclear country . ''\nThe United States does n't think so , with White House spokesman Josh Earnest saying , `` The initial analysis is not consistent with the North Korean claims . ''\nThat analysis is n't definitive , though , with some experts saying it 's possible Pyongyang detonated a different type of hydrogen bomb .\nNorsar , a Norway-based group that monitors nuclear tests , noted this fact and estimated , based on the seismic readings , a blast equivalent to less than 10,000 tons of TNT , smaller than those of the atomic bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki , and far less than thermonuclear weapons that typically are as potent as millions of tons of TNT .\nThe group later added that as this test took place deeper underground , it would be harder to monitor radiation and thus determine the type of weapon tested . The U.S. , South Korea Japan and China are all testing for airborne or ground radiation in the region . So far , the South Korean and Japanese attempts have not found any evidence of radiation .\nIt 's possible North Korea has a `` boosted '' weapon , one that uses a small amount of fusion to boost the fission process , but is not a hydrogen bomb , but whether there was a hydrogen element is n't known .\nIndeed , given the secrecy surrounding North Korea , it may be difficult to ever know ; the last test , in 2013 , has experts split over whether the device detonated then was plutonium or uranium .\nEven if it was n't an H-bomb , there 's little doubt that North Korea did conduct a new significant nuclear test despite persistent calls not to do so .\nIf it was , it would be a game changer , said Mike Chinoy , a fellow at the University of Southern California 's U.S.-China Institute .\n`` But evidence seems to suggest it was n't a full hydrogen bomb . ''\nHowever , he said that with each test North Korean nuclear scientists get more data and as a result closer to being able to miniaturize nuclear weapons , a development that would allow the country to deploy nuclear weapons on long-range missiles .\n`` Whether it was a full H-bomb or not it is still a worrying development , '' he said .\nThe underground test , which happened at 10 a.m. ( 8:30 p.m . ET Tuesday ) , corresponded with a magnitude-5.1 seismic event centered 12 miles ( 19 kilometers ) east-southeast of Sungjibaegam , according to the U.S. Geological Survey . That 's comparable to readings from North Korea 's most recent plutonium test in 2013 .\n`` We wo n't know for another few days or weeks whether this was ( a hydrogen bomb ) , '' said Martin Navias , a military expert at King 's College London . `` It does n't look like one ; ... one would have expected it to be greater if it was an H-bomb . ''\nAfter being briefed by his nation 's military , South Korean lawmaker Shin Kyung-min questioned the credibility of the hydrogen bomb claim .

''\nCount Bruce Bennett , a senior defense analyst at the nonpartisan Rand research group , among the skeptics . He said North Korea has had trouble `` mastering even the basics of a fission weapon , '' so it 's a big leap to think it could create an even more complicated hydrogen bomb .\nWhether or not it 's a hydrogen bomb , the test did get the world 's attention .\n`` Any kind of nuclear test , like the one that North Korea conducted ... is provocative and a flagrant violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions , '' said Earnest .\nAnd that -- sticking it to world and regional powers -- may be Pyongyang 's aim .\nJUST WATCHED Who is Kim Jong Un ?
