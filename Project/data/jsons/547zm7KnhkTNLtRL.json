    "content": "The bus from the Palace Hotel in east Midtown had taken only 16 minutes to get to downtown Brooklyn in the heat of midday New York City traffic , and because the bus was ferrying delegates from the Democratic National Committee who would decide if they would bring their 2016 convention to the city \u2019 s biggest borough , this relatively easy commute was cause for celebration .\nAnd so when the dozen or so delegates stepped off the bus Monday at the entrance to the Barclays Center , the gleaming new basketball arena that , depending on who you ask , has come to symbolize Brooklyn \u2019 s rebirth or its ruin , they were greeted triumphantly by Chuck Schumer , who proudly calls himself the first senator from Brooklyn in over a century .\n\u201c Welcome , welcome to Brooklyn , \u201d the senator sang as each delegate descended from the bus . Schumer , who for a day at least was the borough \u2019 s designated chief cheerleader , shouted out their hometowns in turn as the delegates told him where they hailed from , as if hearing the names rendered in the distinct twang of Brooklyn would provide some of the comforts of home .\n\u201c Miami ! D.C. , OK ! Broooooookkklllllynnn , \u201d rang out as one local got off the bus and fell into Schumer \u2019 s waiting embrace . \u201c I \u2019 ve lived here for 63 years and it keeps getting better and better . \u201d\nAs a crowd of Brooklynites gathered around the perimeter of the Barclays Center and gawked , the delegates stepped onto a long blue carpet ( to distinguish from Republican red , see ? ) , followed by a local high school marching band and step team , which serenaded the streets with \u201c Celebrate \u201d and other horn-heavy hits .\nOnce the delegates were safely inside , where they dined on bratwurst from the hipster restaurant Brooklyn and Bangers and old-school local nosh like Junior \u2019 s , Schumer stepped out alongside a phalanx of local elected officials to make the case to the media that the DNC should call New York home in 2016 .\n\u201c My high school alone , Madison High School , had three senators at one point\u2014a Republican , an independent , and a Democrat , \u201d he said . \u201c We have a Supreme Court justice , several Pulitzer Prize and Nobel Prize winners , and Chris Rock , all from one high school in Brooklyn . So there is something special in the air in Brooklyn , and every one of the delegates will breathe it and go away better for it . Brooklyn has become hip , cool , and young\u2014just like their senator . \u201d\nAs for those other cities vying to host the Democrats in \u2019 16 , well , Schumer seemed to say , who were we kidding ?\n\u201c Now , people say that Philadelphia is our other major contender , \u201d he said . \u201c Philly is a nice city , but it ain \u2019 t Brooklyn . \u201d\nThe senator pointed to the statue at Coney Island of Pee Wee Reese with his arm around Jackie Robinson , a moment captured to quell the booing Robinson was facing during a game in Cincinnati\u2014a town that , Schumer noted , is near Columbus , another city vying to host the DNC .\nAnd what about concerns that the hotels of Midtown are too far away from the Barclays Center ?\n\u201c Gobble-dy-gook .

But most important it would prove a validation of de Blasio \u2019 s message for the Democratic Party : that it has grown too cozy with the concerns of rich financiers on Wall Street and not focused enough on those who struggle to get by in the outer boroughs .
