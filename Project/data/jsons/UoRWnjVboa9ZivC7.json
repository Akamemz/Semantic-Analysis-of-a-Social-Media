    "content": "President Bill Clinton speaks to the nation following his acquittal by the U.S. Senate on impeachment charges , February 12 , 1999 . ( Blake Sell / Reuters )\nThe anti-Clinton case then was stronger than the anti-Trump case is now .\nThere \u2019 s been a cottage industry in accusing Republicans of impeachment hypocrisy .\nThey happily impeached Bill Clinton and now vociferously oppose the impeachment of Donald Trump , even though Clinton was accused of obstruction of justice \u2014 just as Trump is now .\nThere are uncomfortable parallels . The Democrats most fervent about impeachment say that it is their duty to do it no matter what , politics be damned . They speculate that perhaps the polling on impeachment will improve once it \u2019 s under way . Republicans said the same thing in the 1990s , and the Clinton impeachment ended in a fizzle .\nAnd it \u2019 s certainly true that both Clinton and Trump behaved appallingly when under investigation .\nGiven that the Clinton impeachment , as a practical matter , acted as a censure vote and Clinton \u2019 s misconduct didn \u2019 t involve his core presidential duties , there \u2019 s a good argument that a formal censure would have been the wiser course . In retrospect , Newt Gingrich doesn \u2019 t give himself high marks for how he handled it .\nThat said , the case for Clinton \u2019 s impeachment was still stronger than the case for Trump \u2019 s .\nThe independent counsel in the Clinton case , Ken Starr , acting under a law that compelled him to notify Congress of impeachable offenses , said there was \u201c substantial and credible evidence \u201d that Clinton was guilty of eleven possible impeachable offenses . Starr didn \u2019 t , like Mueller , exonerate Clinton on the underlying matter and \u201c not exonerate \u201d him on the process crimes .\nMost important , Clinton flat-out perjured himself , which no one disputed . If Trump had done the same in the Russia probe , he \u2019 d have been impeached already .\nIn the 1990s , there was bipartisan support for an impeachment inquiry and a strong consensus for punishing the president . Neither exists today .\nWhile it \u2019 s easy to think that Clinton was always safe from removal in the Senate , and for the most part he was , there was a moment of legitimate peril for him . Under current conditions , it \u2019 s impossible to imagine Trump facing similar jeopardy .\nIt \u2019 s worth recalling all of this , and in what follows , I draw on the book I wrote on the Clinton presidency in 2003 ( the original quotes are from my research at the time ) .\nStarr wasn \u2019 t , like Robert Mueller , a special counsel who is supposed to be tightly tethered to the Justice Department . He was an independent counsel who was envisioned under the law as a quasi-independent prosecutor who would serve up impeachment referrals to Congress .\nAlmost every aspect of the independent-counsel statute was a trespass on the executive branch : Congress required the attorney general to ask for the appointment of independent counsel in certain circumstances ; gave to a panel of judges the power to make the appointment ; and invested in the independent counsel , once selected , prosecutorial powers with almost no check from the rest of the executive branch .\nFoolishly , instead of letting the independent-counsel statute lapse , Bill Clinton signed a renewal in 1993 . He thus ensured endless investigations of his administration and , once the Monica Lewinsky affair got caught up in the Paula Jones sexual-harassment lawsuit against him , a huge step toward his own impeachment .\nBy the end of 1997 , Ken Starr was about to move on to the report-writing phase of the Whitewater investigation , the original cause for his appointment , when his office got word of the Lewinsky matter .\nA confidante of Lewinsky \u2019 s , Linda Tripp , called Starr \u2019 s office with information about Clinton \u2019 s efforts to keep the former intern quiet . Her allegations had a thematic connection to the rest of Starr \u2019 s work , since they involved attempts to ensure someone \u2019 s non-cooperation with a court proceeding by offering job help , a subplot of Whitewater .\nWhen Starr \u2019 s deputy Jackie Bennett called deputy attorney general Eric Holder to apprise him of the situation , Holder \u2019 s reaction was , \u201c Wha-wha-what ? \u201d There was really no option but expanding Starr \u2019 s authority to deal with the case . With Newsweek close to publishing an article on the affair , Holder told me , \u201c It was pretty clear to us \u2014 there wouldn \u2019 t be time to get somebody else in there , \u201d and if the opportunity had been missed to move quickly , \u201c we would \u2019 ve been criticized , justifiably . \u201d\nOnce the essentials of the Lewinsky story became clear \u2014sex with an intern , attempts to get her to lie and win her silence , false statements in sworn testimony \u2014 Starr \u2019 s path was obvious and nearly inevitable : an investigation leading to an impeachment referral to Congress .\nThe independent-counsel statute essentially demanded it as a matter of law : An independent counsel , said the statute , \u201c shall advise the House of Representatives of any substantial and credible information . . . that may constitute grounds for an impeachment. \u201d Creating this automatic pilot toward impeachment was one of the purposes of the misbegotten statute in the first place . It relieved Congress of the political risk of initiating impeachment proceedings itself .\nThere \u2019 s no escaping the fact that President Clinton committed crimes in the Lewinsky affair . First and foremost , he perjured himself repeatedly \u2014 though his defenders would perform legalistic dances to try to keep the \u201c p-word \u201d from applying to his false statements .\nTheir chief argument was that his lies about Lewinsky in his deposition in the Jones case were immaterial to the case and therefore not technically perjury . The judge in the Paula Jones sexual-harassment case against Clinton , Susan Wright , did ultimately exclude evidence related to Lewinsky from the Jones case , but that was not because it was immaterial . She stipulated at the time that Clinton \u2019 s Lewinsky testimony \u201c might be relevant. \u201d Later , she elaborated : \u201c Contrary to numerous assertions , this court did not rule that evidence of the Lewinsky matter was irrelevant or immaterial to the issues in plaintiff \u2019 s case . \u201d\nBesides materiality , there are two other elements to perjury : falsehood and the intent to deceive . Clinton \u2019 s defenders say his testimony was literally truthful by the definition Clinton assigned his words . But witnesses can not create their own private languages . Their words must be understood by their common meaning , by which standard Clinton \u2019 s testimony was clearly false . As for intent , Clinton was open about his desire to deceive . \u201c I misled people , \u201d he said in his August 17 , 1998 , confession speech to the nation . \u201c I can only tell you I was motivated by many factors . First , by a desire to protect myself from the embarrassment of my own conduct. \u201d Imagine every dubious or dishonest thing Trump said during the Mueller investigation being repeated under oath \u2014 that was what Clinton did .\nWhen he testified in his Jones deposition on January 17 , 1998 , he lied , most fundamentally , when he denied having sex with Lewinsky . The Jones lawyers offered a definition of sex drawn from the Violence Against Women Act , and Wright pared it down to : \u201c contact with the genitalia , anus , groin , breast , inner thigh , or buttocks of any person with an attempt to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person. \u201d Even by Clinton \u2019 s solipsistic and implausible interpretation of this definition \u2014 i.e. , that it was possible for Lewinsky to have sex with him while he wasn \u2019 t having sex with her \u2014 Clinton lied , since it is obvious that he touched Lewinsky in places that qualified as sex under the definition .\nHe lied when he said he had no memory of being alone with Lewinsky . He lied when he said he didn \u2019 t recall giving any gifts to Lewinsky ( three weeks earlier , he \u2019 d given her a Rockettes blanket , a New York City skyline pin , sunglasses , cherry chocolates , a stuffed animal , and other trinkets ) . He lied when he said that he talked to Lewinsky about the possibility of her being subpoenaed in the Jones case only once , and that in passing and jokingly . He lied when he said that he didn \u2019 t know about Lewinsky \u2019 s subpoena in the Jones case when he talked to her for the last time . He lied when he denied that Vernon Jordan kept him updated about Lewinsky \u2019 s status in the Jones case .\nAfter the impeachment fight had burned out in April 1999 , Wright \u2014 the same judge Hillary praises for allegedly totally vindicating Clinton in the Jones suit \u2014 sanctioned Clinton for contempt of court . She wrote that there is \u201c simply no escaping the fact \u201d that Clinton gave \u201c intentionally false \u201d answers to questions from the Jones lawyers in a way \u201c designed to obstruct the judicial process. \u201d Even Abbe Lowell , chief investigator for the Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee , had told his fellow Democrats upon first evaluating the evidence , \u201c Perjury in his deposition . No question that he lied . \u201d\nClinton \u2019 s testimony before Ken Starr \u2019 s grand jury in August , after he had finally decided to admit his affair , was an encore performance of his civil-deposition lies . He lied when he denied having sex with Lewinsky , and he lied when he said their \u201c inappropriate \u201d relationship didn \u2019 t begin until 1996 . He lied when he said his civil deposition in the Jones case had been truthful . He lied when he denied being alone with Lewinsky . He lied when he said that , when he coached Betty Currie , his personal secretary , with a series of rhetorical questions based on falsehoods , he was merely trying to jog his own memory . He lied when he said he hadn \u2019 t told Currie to get back the gifts he had lied about not remembering giving to Lewinsky . And he lied in denying that he had lied to his aides in the wake of the Lewinsky revelations .\nIn addition to his perjury , Clinton was guilty of obstruction of justice . By suggesting to Lewinsky that she give an affidavit to the Jones lawyers , Clinton couldn \u2019 t have been suggesting anything other than that she lie \u2014 and deny the relationship \u2014 in order to avoid being deposed . That is the only possible interpretation , unless we believe that Clinton was urging Lewinsky to expose the relationship preemptively and launch the near-destruction of his presidency .\nIt seems almost certain that \u2014 although both he and Currie denied it \u2014 Clinton sent Betty Currie to pick up from Lewinsky the gifts he had given her , in order to keep this evidence safe from a subpoena .\nThere was little ambiguity about all of this . It was locked-down and obvious .\nIt \u2019 s easy to forget the initial shock upon the revelation of Clinton \u2019 s conduct .\nLater , by the time the controversy had neared its end , it seemed outlandish to think Clinton could have been forced from office . But that was only an illusion created after the fact . It could have been different \u2014 for instance , in August when Democratic senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut condemned Clinton from the Senate floor , along with fellow Democratic senators Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York . \u201c I \u2019 m pretty convinced that Clinton was within inches of losing the presidency then , \u201d Lanny Davis , who had left the White House but was assisting in its defense , told me . \u201c Because that could have sent a wave of Democratic senators away from him under the cover of Joe Lieberman and Bob Kerrey . And then he would have been very , very hard pressed to stay in office . \u201d\nInstead , Lieberman \u2019 s condemnation helped Clinton \u2014 it expressed disgust without calling for resignation or impeachment .\nNearly everyone agreed on the need for the House to undertake an impeachment inquiry , though . Thirty-one Democrats voted for the Republican inquiry plan , and the rest voted for an alternative Democratic plan .\nThere was a consensus in the country in favor of punishing Clinton . In December 1998 , Clinton himself asked to be censured . As one of the Democratic censure resolutions said , Clinton had \u201c egregiously failed \u201d his constitutional oath , \u201c violated the trust of the American people , \u201d and \u201c dishonored the office which they have entrusted to him. \u201d This language echoed Lieberman \u2019 s August floor statement , when he said Clinton \u2019 s behavior was \u201c disgraceful \u201d and \u201c immoral \u201d and had \u201c profound public consequences \u201d \u2014 prompting Clinton to respond , \u201c Basically , I agree with what he said . \u201d\nThe Republican House in 1998 was not necessarily a lost cause for Clinton . He could perhaps have peeled Republican moderates away from impeachment by making a full confession . The problem was that he couldn \u2019 t fully admit to his wrongdoing without making a damning case against himself , i.e. , \u201c I \u2019 m a confessed perjurer. \u201d So he had to stick with the word games .\nAsked in one of 81 written questions by Henry Hyde if he had sworn to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth in his Jones deposition , Clinton responded , \u201c I do not recall the precise wording of the oath. \u201d His unresponsiveness and his repetition of his lies in response to the questions \u2014he talked to Currie only \u201c to get as much information as quickly as I could \u201d \u2014 helped seal his fate in the House .\nIt impeached him by 228\u2013206 on an article charging him with perjury before Starr \u2019 s grand jury and by 221\u2013212 on an article charging him with obstruction of justice .\nOf course , the public considered the issue and didn \u2019 t want Clinton removed from office . The argument over impeachment might best be framed by two concessions made by advocates on the different sides . On one hand , there was Clinton \u2019 s lawyer Charles Ruff . Before the House Judiciary Committee , Ruff explained how Clinton had tried to walk a narrow line . \u201c Reasonable people \u2014 and you maybe have reached this conclusion \u2014 could determine that he crossed over that line and that what for him was truthful but misleading or non-responsive and misleading or evasive was , in fact , false. \u201d Although Ruff would not interpret his concession this way , he was essentially saying that in the course of attempting to deceive the court , Clinton told lies \u2014 i.e. , he committed perjury .\nOn the other hand , there was none other than House impeachment manager Congressmsn Lindsey Graham . When asked during the Senate trial if reasonable people could conclude that Clinton shouldn \u2019 t be removed from office even if he was guilty of the crimes of which he was accused , Graham said \u201c absolutely . \u201d\nThe Senate obviously wasn \u2019 t going to convict \u2014 it requires a two-thirds vote \u2014 so even impeachment leader Henry Hyde was briefly considering alternatives . A censure resolution floated by Dianne Feinstein was enticing , with its statement that Clinton \u2019 s conduct \u201c is unacceptable for a president of the United States , does demean the office of the president as well as the president himself , and creates disrespect for laws of the land . \u201d\n\u201c At one time , \u201d Hyde told me , \u201c I was looking for a way to resolve this . \u201d\nWe couldn \u2019 t walk away from pursuing the president , but it was clear that we would not get the two-thirds vote in the Senate . I had hoped to get the majority anyway , and had a couple of our distinguished , courageous senators remained distinguished and courageous , we would have . I thought , having seen the text of Feinstein \u2019 s resolution of condemnation \u2014 which was stronger than our bill of impeachment , it was excoriating \u2014 I would not have been unhappy if that had been adopted by the Senate .\nAs it happened , the Senate voted 55\u201345 to acquit on the perjury count , and 50\u201350 on the obstruction count .

The problem was that he couldn\u2019t fully admit to his wrongdoing without making a damning case against himself, i.e., \u201cI\u2019m a confessed perjurer.\u201d So he had to stick with the word games.\n\nAsked in one of 81 written questions by Henry Hyde if he had sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth in his Jones deposition, Clinton responded, \u201cI do not recall the precise wording of the oath.\u201d His unresponsiveness and his repetition of his lies in response to the questions \u2014he talked to Currie only \u201cto get as much information as quickly as I could\u201d \u2014 helped seal his fate in the House.\n\nIt impeached him by 228\u2013206 on an article charging him with perjury before Starr\u2019s grand jury and by 221\u2013212 on an article charging him with obstruction of justice.\n\nClinton Wasn\u2019t Getting Removed\n\nOf course, the public considered the issue and didn\u2019t want Clinton removed from office. The argument over impeachment might best be framed by two concessions made by advocates on the different sides. On one hand, there was Clinton\u2019s lawyer Charles Ruff. Before the House Judiciary Committee, Ruff explained how Clinton had tried to walk a narrow line. \u201cReasonable people \u2014 and you maybe have reached this conclusion \u2014 could determine that he crossed over that line and that what for him was truthful but misleading or non-responsive and misleading or evasive was, in fact, false.\u201d Although Ruff would not interpret his concession this way, he was essentially saying that in the course of attempting to deceive the court, Clinton told lies \u2014 i.e., he committed perjury.\n\nOn the other hand, there was none other than House impeachment manager Congressmsn Lindsey Graham. When asked during the Senate trial if reasonable people could conclude that Clinton shouldn\u2019t be removed from office even if he was guilty of the crimes of which he was accused, Graham said \u201cabsolutely.\u201d\n\nThe Senate obviously wasn\u2019t going to convict \u2014 it requires a two-thirds vote \u2014 so even impeachment leader Henry Hyde was briefly considering alternatives. A censure resolution floated by Dianne Feinstein was enticing, with its statement that Clinton\u2019s conduct \u201cis unacceptable for a president of the United States, does demean the office of the president as well as the president himself, and creates disrespect for laws of the land.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt one time,\u201d Hyde told me, \u201cI was looking for a way to resolve this.\u201d\n\nWe couldn\u2019t walk away from pursuing the president, but it was clear that we would not get the two-thirds vote in the Senate. I had hoped to get the majority anyway, and had a couple of our distinguished, courageous senators remained distinguished and courageous, we would have. I thought, having seen the text of Feinstein\u2019s resolution of condemnation \u2014 which was stronger than our bill of impeachment, it was excoriating \u2014 I would not have been unhappy if that had been adopted by the Senate.\n\nAs it happened, the Senate voted 55\u201345 to acquit on the perjury count, and 50\u201350 on the obstruction count. Clinton survived, although the debate over his impeachment was just beginning.\n\nSomething to Consider If you enjoyed this article, we have a proposition for you: Join NRPLUS.
