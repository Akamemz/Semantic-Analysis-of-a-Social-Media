    "content": "The Secretary of Defense has frozen a decision by former President Barack Obama to recruit transgender soldiers this year , and a new poll shows the planned recruitment freeze is very popular .\nTwo of every three swing voters say the Pentagon should postpone plans to accept \u201c transgender \u201d people who are trying to live as members of the opposite sex , according to the new poll by Rasmussen Reports .\nDefense Secretary James Mattis explained his July 30 decision to delay Obama \u2019 s plan for six months , just before it was to begin operating :\nSince becoming the Secretary of Defense , I have emphasized that the Department of Defense must measure each policy decision against one critical standard : will the decision affect the readiness and lethality of the force ? Put another way , how will the decision affect the ability of America \u2019 s military to defend the nation ? It is against this standard that I provide the following guidance on the way forward in accessing transgender individuals into the military Services .\nThe six-month delay will encourage and help opponents lobby against Obama \u2019 s pro-transgender policy .\nThroughout 2016 , Obama used his power as president to push schools and other institutions to support the claim by transgender activists that people have a hidden \u201c gender identity \u201d which is independent of their sex and biology . These advocates also say that a person \u2019 s sex is determined by their \u201c gender identity , \u201d not their male-or-female body . In turn , the advocates demand that the federal government force Americans to accept the sex-switching \u201c gender identity \u201d claims made by each person , regardless of scientific data about genetics , biology and the variety of normal behavior and appearances shown by normal women and men .\nTransgender activists were furious about Mattis \u2019 last-minute decision to block Obama \u2019 s directive , which would have resulted in a de-facto endorsement of the transgender ideology by the most respected government institution in the nation .\n\u201c For the past year , transgender troops have been serving openly \u2026 stonewalling on full inclusion will , just like \u2018 don \u2019 t ask , don \u2019 t tell , \u2019 compromise military readiness , \u201d said a statement from the pro-transgender Palm Center in California .\nObama \u2019 s proposal is widely opposed , in part , because it would require soldiers to share bathrooms and shower facilities with people of the opposite sex , and would require the U.S. military pay for the expensive procedures \u2014 such as hormones and perhaps surgery \u2014 used by people trying to live as members of the opposite sex .\nThe military \u2019 s most famous transgender recruit , now named Chelsea Manning , was recently freed from military jail on Obama \u2019 s orders . When serving in Iraq , Manning illegally copied a huge haul of military records and videos and released them to the world .\nThe Rasmussen poll was published just before the Pentagon announcement . The June 26 to June 27 survey of 1,000 likely voters showed 48 percent of voters supporting a delay , only 32 percent oppose a delay and an unusually larger proportion \u2014 21 percent \u2014 avoided comment , saying they were \u201c not sure. \u201d Read the poll here .\nThe cross-tabs , however , showed that GOP supporters split 60 percent for a delay and 23 percent opposition to a delay .
