    "content": "Starting Friday , Joyce Lewis and her family will lose $ 44 from their monthly food stamp benefits .\nThe food stamps buy a lot of economical rice-based meals for the family -- four adults and a grandson who live with Lewis in Spring Hill , Florida .\nOccasionally , when her grocery store is running a deal , Lewis indulges the family with spare ribs or chicken .\nThe benefit -- totaling $ 800 for four adults -- never lasts Lewis and her family a full month .\n`` When I get to the end , we always run out . I try to go to all the food pantries , '' Lewis said .\nFood stamp benefits will be trimmed by $ 5 billion starting Friday , when a temporary bump-up enacted during the recession expires . Millions of families will be affected .\nLewis , 55 , is worried because the cuts are coming at a bad time . Among other things , a second grandchild is due in January .\nShe is also fighting the bank from foreclosing on her home .\nAnd even though she does n't smoke , Lewis suffers from emphysema , which prevents her from working .\nLewis attributes the emphysema to a lifetime of bartending in smoke-filled nonprofit social clubs , such as Elks and Moose lodges .\nHer adult daughters who live with her are n't in a position to work -- one is a new mom , and another is due to give birth soon .\nThe low point came this summer , when she did n't have enough to pay the full electricity bill . Lewis needs power to run her breathing machine to treat her illness . So she pawned her wedding ring for $ 325 .\nA few weeks ago , she started getting disability payments for her disease . She promptly used it to get back her ring for $ 487 before it was sold .\n`` That was $ 162 I paid in interest to keep the lights on and put food on the table , '' Lewis said .\nEnrollment in food stamps , formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , has soared .\nSome 47.6 million people , or nearly 15 % of the population , get them , according to September federal data . That compares to 26.3 million , or 8.7 % of the population , in 2007 . The average benefit per person is $ 133.19 a month .\nFor families who rely on food stamps , it means a lot of planning and tough choices .\nHugh Sewell , 54 , has been on food stamps for two years . He gets the maximum allowed for his family of three -- $ 526 a month . The benefits will likely be cut by $ 29 to $ 497 , according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture .\nThat would be tough , Sewell says . The first time the family got food stamps , after he lost his job in 2010 , they blew through the allotment halfway through the month .\nAfter that , the Sewells started making detailed budgets , meal plans and shopping lists .\n`` We buy a lot of beans , rice and potatoes , '' said Sewell , who lives in Philadelphia . `` Towards the end of the month , you 're eating all the box stuff , and a lot more pasta with sauce .

He did the math and found that $ 12 an hour was just enough to cause a reduction in his government benefits , and could cost him and his family its Medicaid coverage for health care .\nAt the same time , the income from $ 12 an hour would not be enough to pay his bills , including the $ 900 a month he would have to pay for health insurance for his family .\nSewell is hoping to find a job that pays enough to allow his family to get off government assistance .",
