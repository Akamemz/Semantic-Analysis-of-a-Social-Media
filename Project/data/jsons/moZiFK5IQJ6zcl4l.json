The report , which stretched more than 100 pages , scrutinized the initiation of the Mueller probe .\nDespite the resources devoted to it and the hype by Giuliani and Trump allies , the document was never released . But it \u2019 s still proven explosive , as one of its authors says some of its contents formed the genesis of the single biggest political crisis of Trump \u2019 s turbulent presidency .\n\u201c That outline that I gave to the State Department was originally prepared to be included in the counter-report , \u201d Giuliani told The Daily Beast late Thursday night . \u201c It was prepared to provide a guide for text that could be included in the [ final ] counter-report . \u201d\nHe added , \u201c I undertook the [ Ukraine ] investigation \u201d as part of a broader effort that began last year \u201c to find out how much evidence existed that could exonerate [ President Trump ] . \u201d\nThat Ukraine-related investigation started as an attempt to delegitimize the Mueller probe into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election . But , according to Giuliani , it tipped him off to the idea of getting the Ukrainian government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter , despite apparent warnings from one of the top U.S. diplomats in Ukraine that the information he was getting from Ukrainian political figures on Biden was not to be trusted .
