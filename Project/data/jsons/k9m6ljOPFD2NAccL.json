    "content": "As coronavirus outbreaks are slowly brought to heel in many places around the world , the US is among a handful of countries facing a surge of new infections .\nMore than two dozen states are now seeing increases in new cases over the last 14 days .\nOf these , Texas , Florida , Arizona and California have emerged as the country 's latest virus epicentres .\nBut while cases are clearly rising , state leaders and health experts are divided on the cause .\nHere 's a look at these four US hotspots , the facts and figures raising alarm , and the theories that may help explain each surge .\nFirst , it 's important to note that across the US , more efficient testing has played some role in the climbing case count . The number of Covid-19 tests being administered now is nearly double what it was in April and May .\nBut the positive test rate tells us that testing ca n't explain away the rise .\nIf lots of tests are being conducted and the spread of the coronavirus has been reduced , then the positive case rate would fall in tandem . The World Health Organization says that states should have a positive case rate at or below 5 % for two weeks before they loosen restrictions on movement .\nEven with testing success stories , it 's clear that the southern and western US are seeing a particularly sharp spike in infections and their rate .\nAs of 30 June , Texas , Florida , Arizona or California all fall under that category - and all fail to meet the bar .\nAfter nearly three months of new cases hovering between 1,000 and 2,000 each day - Texas ' infection count has spiked in the last two weeks , with up to 6,000 new illnesses reported in a single day .\nThe sharp rise in cases has been mirrored by record highs in hospital admissions - reaching at 5,913 on Monday - and stoking fears that the state 's hospitals will soon be overwhelmed .\nIf this trajectory persists , Houston , the state 's most populous city , `` would become the worst affected city in the US '' , possibly rivalling what 's happening now in Brazil , wrote Peter Hotez , director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children 's Hospital , on Twitter . `` I can not really see how things get better on their own . ''\nWhy the rise ? Many point to the south-western state 's leading role peeling back lockdown measures .\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott allowed his stay home order to expire on 30 April , with almost all businesses - including bars and restaurants - operating to at least 50 % capacity by early June . Last week , amid the surge , the governor shut down all bars and ordered restaurants to cut down capacity from 75 to 50 % .\n`` If I could go back and redo anything , it probably would have been to slow down the opening of bars , '' Mr Abbott said to El Paso station KVIA-TV . A `` bar setting , in reality , just does n't work with a pandemic '' .\nPacked restaurants and bars may also fit with another national trend : the average age of people diagnosed with Covid-19 has decreased gradually throughout the pandemic .\nIn certain counties , people under the age 30 make up the majority of Covid patients , Mr Abbott said at a press conference earlier this month , which `` typically results from people going to the bar-type settings '' .\nParts of the state are now also enacting rules on face coverings .\nPolicies on masks are one of the factors differentiating states like Texas from those seeing lower transmission rates .\nIn 11 states with mask rules in place - including New York and Illinois - the number of new cases has declined 25 % in the last two weeks , according to an analysis by the Philadelphia Inquirer . On the other hand , in states where only some employees have to wear masks , new cases have risen by an average of 70 % .\nFlorida 's stay home order expired shortly after Texas ' , on 4 May .\nWhile the state 's most populous counties , Miami-Dade and Broward , held off until 18 May , Florida still had one of the more aggressive reopening strategies in the US .\nDisney properties and beaches began reopening by the end of last month , just as Americans across the country celebrated the Memorial Day holiday . Days into June , bars , restaurants , gyms , and shops were also resuming business .\nNow , the Sunshine State is seeing a surge in Covid-19 - this past weekend saw over 8,500 new cases per day . In the last two weeks , cases have increased fivefold , according to the New York Times .\nHospitalisations are up as well , but Florida 's death toll has not seen so sharp a rise thus far .\nThe governor 's answer for why that may be lines up with what the White House has said : more testing and more young people with infections .\nRepublican Governor Ron DeSantis said a backlog `` test dump '' coupled with transmission in the 18 to 35 age range is behind the concerning counts . He said that 20 % of Floridians aged 25 to 34 are testing positive , and called on younger residents to be more careful , citing graduation parties that ignored social distancing rules .\n`` We 've been stressing avoiding the three Cs , which are : closed spaces with poor ventilation , crowded places with many people nearby and close-contact settings , such as close-range conversations , '' Mr DeSantis said .\nBut some experts say even with testing , the numbers still point to community spread linked to more social contact .\nFormer CDC Director Tom Frieden told Fox News on Sunday : `` As a doctor , a scientist , an epidemiologist , I can tell you with 100 % certainty that in most states where you 're seeing an increase , it is a real increase . It is not more tests ; it is more spread of the virus . ''\nMr DeSantis has stopped short of enacting any mandatory measures to curb Covid-19 transmission - however , mayors in South Florida , the hardest-hit region of the state , have been discussing next steps .\nIn Miami , Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach , beaches will be closed for the Fourth of July Independence Day weekend . Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez will also be limiting gatherings to no more than 50 people , with masks required .\nArizona may be the region with the most concerning surge in America . In mid-June , a Harvard epidemiologist noted the state had a higher case count and percent positivity rate than Brazil and Peru at the time .\nIt 's a familiar story here too : the south-western state 's spike follows its reopening timeline .\nRepublican Governor Doug Ducey lifted Arizona 's stay-at-home order on 15 May . In the time since , dine-in restaurants , bars , casinos , gyms , golf clubs and swimming pools reopened . There were health recommendations but no mandate on face coverings or enforcement of social distancing .\nAs of 30 June , cases have been increasing by 85 % in a 14-day period , according to the Covid Exit Strategy tracker .
