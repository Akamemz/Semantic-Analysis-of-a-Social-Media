As is usually the case for old weapons , they do not work properly . They break down . We don \u2019 t have anything else to use , so we have to use them. \u201d Their sniper rifle is from the 60 \u2019 s and 70 \u2019 s . The older they get the less reliable they are . \u201d\nAnother top Peshmerga Commander told \u2588\u2588\u2588 , \u201c ISIS has 6 Divisions of American-made weapons that the Iraqi Army lost. \u201d He said that the Iraqi Army sells their weapons to the Islamic State for nothing , \u201c like a pair of pants , \u201d in order to survive .\n\u201c If we had the weapons , it would be over , \u201d said the Commander . He added that when the Peshmerga enter villages , the Islamic State fear them despite their superior weapons . While the Peshmerga have received some light weapons , he noted it was not enough to make a difference .\nSeven countries have promised to supply weapons to the Kurds to help fight the Islamic State . Several countries have already delivered arms and military equipment , including Britain , France , Germany and Albania . Rudaw news reported that Peshmerga Minister Mustafa Sayid Qadir said that his forces are using foreign-supplied arms in their daily fight against the Islamic State ( IS ) . He told Rudaw \u201c What we have received so far are medium-sized weapons\u2026we have sent it all to the units and command centers. \u201d Before the Peshmerga can use the equipment and supplies out in the field , they have to receive training , so the majority of the foreign supplies still has either not been delivered or used in the field .\nThe Peshmerga officer said , \u201c if we had the weapons that the U.S. gave to Iraq , we wouldn \u2019 t be afraid of any of the countries around us \u2014 or Daash ( ISIS ) \u2014 and nobody would be able to take those weapons away from us . Daash is nothing if we had the modern weapons . We are not afraid of Daash at all. \u201d The U.S. has spent billions of dollars on military equipment and supplies for the Iraqi central government .\nThe Peshmerga recaptured 6 villages last night from Islamic State control and are retaking more territory everyday . The Peshmerga \u2019 s task of retaking a village is a complex and difficult situation on many fronts . After the Islamic State captures a village or town , they booby-trap the area with explosive devices to prevent the Peshmerga from entering . The Mosul Dam had over 25 explosives that the Peshmerga had to diffuse after they retook it from Islamic State jihadists . After retaking an area , the Peshmerga send in teams of explosive experts to clear the area ; which has resulted in many lives lost .\nAnother difficulty the Peshmerga encounter are the villagers joining the Islamic State and fighting against the Peshmerga . \u201c More Peshmerga have been killed by the Iraqi villagers that have accepted Daash ( ISIS ) , and are against the Kurds , than actually by Daash , \u201d said a Peshmerga Commander . Another Peshmerga officer spoke about a town near the Syrian border where the villagers killed members of the Peshmerga when they tried to liberate it from ISIS . \u201c Mosul is 90 % Daash ( ISIS ) , \u201d said a Peshmerga senior officer . \u201c Anybody who stayed at this point of time are with Daash\u2026Some of the towns that Peshmerga were going into to retake , the villagers fought against the Peshmerga which complicates things . The people that stayed , fight against Peshmerga \u2014 the others have fled , \u201d he said .\nThe international community should implement a strategy of aerial bombings of towns and villages that ISIS has complete control over \u2014 including Mosul . The United States needs to use all the necessary force to decimate the Islamic State and use large aerial bombing in certain areas is necessary \u2014 and in some situations , the only option .\n\u201c We are finding Chechens , Afghanis , Egyptians , Saudis , Syrians , Algerians , and Libyans with the majority being from Iraq and Syria , \u201d said a senior Peshmerga officer .\nAccording to Rudaw news , the Peshmerga are recruiting Christians to join the fight against ISIS .

Some of the Peshmerga have been fighting since they were 13 years old .\nThe Kurds are pro-democracy and pro-West . \u201c We would join NATO if we could \u201d said a Peshmerga senior military officer . \u201c Why shouldn \u2019 t we be cooperating with America or any Western country ? Why wouldn \u2019 t any Western country want to cooperate with us ? It was America that has been keeping our enemies at bay .
