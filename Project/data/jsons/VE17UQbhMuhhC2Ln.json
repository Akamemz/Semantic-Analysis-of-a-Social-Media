    "content": "The collapse of the Obama administration \u2019 s dogged pursuit of retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn has come to represent a broader assault on the Trump campaign , transition and presidency that Attorney General William P. Barr has concluded amounted to FBI \u201c sabotage . \u201d\nFrom July 31 , 2016 , to deep into the Trump presidency , the FBI littered its investigative trail with questionable conduct that led the president to believe that agents had been after him all along .\n\u201c It was an attempted overthrow of the government of the United States of America and duly elected president , \u201d Mr. Trump told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 in an Oval Office interview last week . \u201c And we caught them . \u201d\nNotes taken by FBI agent Peter Strzok filed Wednesday in the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington show that President Barack Obama took a keen interest in probing Mr. Flynn , Mr. Trump \u2019 s first national security adviser . Mr. Obama said in early January 2017 to make sure the FBI had the right people investigating .\nAt the time , White House officials on their way out the door asked the intelligence community to unmask Mr. Flynn in scores of secret intelligence reports from the National Security Agency so they could read what he was up to .\nOverall , FBI agents embraced a sketchy 35-page collection of anti-Trump claims called the dossier . Using the dossier as a basis , they acquired a year of wiretaps on campaign volunteer Carter Page , with agents misleading judges in the process , and cited conspiracy allegations to fuel their Crossfire Hurricane investigation .\nThe FBI hired a cast of confidential human sources , most notably Stefan Halper , to try to entrap Mr . Page and associate George Papadopoulos . Their secretly recorded conversations with Mr. Halper came up empty , so the FBI ignored them , a government report said .\nThat was a theme in the momentous report by Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz . Time and again , the FBI obtained favorable information on Mr . Page yet withheld it from federal judges so that agents could win a wiretap extension .\nIntelligence services told the FBI early in 2017 that Russians had penetrated the dossier \u2019 s data collection stream and added fake anti-Trump claims .\nPerhaps worse , the main Russian source for Christopher Steele \u2019 s dossier told the FBI that he merely repeated unsubstantiated gossip .\nYet the FBI stuck with the dossier . Mr. Horowitz found that two FBI employees played major roles in keeping from judges that Mr . Page was a verified CIA informant . One FBI lawyer falsified a CIA email .\nNot lost on Republicans was the overriding fact that the FBI invested huge currency in a dossier that was financed by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee and was designed to sink the Trump presidency .\nAlways lurking beneath the FBI maneuvering was a series of text messages between Mr. Strzok , who led Crossfire Hurricane , and his lover , FBI counsel Lisa Page . Both expressed complete disgust for candidate Trump . Mr. Strzok vowed to \u201c stop \u201d him .\nThe FBI fired Mr. Strzok . Ms . Page resigned and has joined MSNBC as an analyst , along with a cast of other ardent Trump opponents , such as Obama-era CIA Director John O. Brennan and Andrew Weissmann , top gun to special counsel Robert Mueller . Mr. Weissmann even gave Democrats advice during an MSNBC appearance on how to bring down Mr. Trump .\nThe Brennan perch opens another chapter in what Republicans believe was a Democratic Party and Obama loyalists operation to sabotage Mr. Trump from Nov. 8 , 2016 , on .\nMr. Brennan spent much of his first two years on MSNBC calling Mr. Trump an agent or asset of Moscow \u2014 in other words , a spy . He predicted that scores of Trump allies would be indicted on charges of conspiring with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election . When none was , Mr. Brennen said he must have been misinformed .\nAt CNN , Mr. Obama \u2019 s director of national intelligence , James R. Clapper , played the same tune as Mr. Brennan : Mr. Trump was a spy handled by the Kremlin .\nNeither Mr. Brennan nor Mr. Clapper ever presented any evidence .\nAll the while , Trump aides suspected that Obama loyalists were mounting information warfare against the president by planting news stories , some of them highly inaccurate .\nThat brings things to the Flynn case . A well-timed leak to The Washington Post revived the FBI probe into Mr. Flynn as he served on the transition team and then became White House national security adviser .\nMr. Strzok had moved to close the Flynn case because his team found no links to Russian collusion . But then the FBI recorded Mr. Flynn \u2019 s calls with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak . Someone leaked to The Post that Mr. Flynn had discussed Mr. Obama \u2019 s new sanctions against Moscow . The Trump team denied this , giving agents a reason to interview Mr. Flynn . He later admitted in court to lying to agents .\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C . Circuit on Wednesday ordered the U.S. District Court to dismiss the Flynn case , as sought by the attorney general .\nMr. Barr assigned U.S. Attorney Jeff Jensen to review the Flynn prosecution . Mr. Jensen uncovered notes that showed the FBI had a strategy of trying to get Mr. Flynn to lie or admit violating the centuries-old Logan Act , or to get him fired .\nFBI Director James B.

She alleged that Mueller prosecutors withheld favorable , or Brady , material on her client that would have shown he was entrapped into pleading guilty .

Rice \u2014 had talked about getting Mr. Flynn prosecuted .\nKey dates in the Trump-Russia saga show that at each step there was never any evidence \u2014 an informant , email , text message , communications intercept or whistleblower \u2014 that a Trump associate had conspired with the Kremlin .\nOn July 31 , 2016 , the FBI opened its historic investigation into the Trump campaign by picking four targets : Mr. Flynn , Mr .
