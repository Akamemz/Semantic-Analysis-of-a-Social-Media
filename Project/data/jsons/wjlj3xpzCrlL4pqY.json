The new law is a near-ban on abortion after the 12th week of pregnancy . Unless a lawsuit or court action intervenes before it takes effect this summer , it looks like Arkansas will become the toughest state to get an abortion after the 3 month mark .\nLawmakers in the Republican-dominated Legislature defied Gov . Mike Beebe , overriding the Democrat 's veto . The House voted 56-33 on Wednesday to override Beebe 's veto , a day after the Senate voted to do the same . The votes come less than a week after the Legislature overrode a veto of a separate bill banning most abortions starting in the 20th week of pregnancy . That bill took effect immediately after the final override vote , whereas the 12-week ban wo n't take effect until this summer .\nAbortion rights advocates say they will sue over this vote , but those who advocated and voted for this law are not scared of this challenge . The governor , who has continually stated that these laws are unconstitutional due to the Roe v. Wade decision , will face opponents from the Right .\n`` Not the governor , nor anyone else other than the courts , can determine if something is constitutional or unconstitutional , '' Rep. Bruce Westerman , a Republican from Hot Springs , said in urging his colleagues to override Beebe . Bill sponsor Sen. Jason Rapert , a Republican from Conway , watched the vote from the House gallery and said a number of law firms have offered to help the state defend the laws in court , if it comes to that . `` I 'm just grateful that this body has continued to stand up for the bills that have passed .
