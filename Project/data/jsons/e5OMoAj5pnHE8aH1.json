But a general election pitting Donald Trump against Hillary Clinton \u2013 two candidates with abysmal scores for honesty among voters \u2013 is another , sending the fact-checking world into overdrive .\nIs Mr. Trump really worth $ 10 billion , as he claims ? ( Not according to Forbes magazine . ) Is it true that Mrs. Clinton \u201c slept \u201d during the Benghazi terror attack in 2012 , as Trump says ? ( No , according to Clinton testimony . ) Was Clinton allowed to use a personal email server when she was secretary of State , as she has asserted ? ( No , according to a recent report by the State Department \u2019 s Office of the inspector general . )\nTrump alone is enough to keep the entire fact-checking industry afloat . When the flamboyant billionaire gave a big speech recently denouncing Clinton , the Associated Press assigned 12 reporters just to check the veracity of his assertions \u2013 \u201c a whole platoon of journalistic talent that could have been doing other things , \u201d moaned Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple .\nIt \u2019 s easy to get discouraged by all the charges of lying hurled around \u2013 Lyin \u2019 Ted , LyingCrookedHillary ( both a verbal Trump charge and the name of a Trump campaign site ) , handouts from the Clinton campaign that lay out Trump \u2019 s \u201c lies , hypocrisy , and catastrophic ideas. \u201d And certainly , to some voters , the whole tone of the campaign is so depressing , the answer is just to tune out and stay home on Election Day .\nBut to veteran fact-checkers , it \u2019 s the time to shine . Angie Drobnic Holan , editor in chief of the Pulitzer Prize-winning site PolitiFact.com , says she \u2019 s \u201c really optimistic , \u201d citing the growth of media fact-checking .\n\u201c You can have a cynical take on that , but mine is more optimistic , \u201d because fact-checking is especially needed this year , she says . \u201c Donald Trump is a candidate who has persistent problems with accuracy , and I \u2019 m heartened that there \u2019 s widespread recognition that this is someone who needs to be fact-checked . \u201d\nTrump supporters , not surprisingly , disagree .
