    "content": "The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the heart of President Obama \u2019 s health care law , ruling the federal government can compel Americans to buy health insurance , and striking a new balance for the scope of federal authority in the 21st century .\nThe ruling lets Mr. Obama continue to push the law ahead of its full implementation in 2014 and will likely amp up pressure on a number of states who had been awaiting a court decision before plowing ahead with state requirements .\nThe complex 5-4 decision is a major legal boost to Mr. Obama just months before he faces voters in a battle for re-election , and it complicates matters for Republicans on Capitol Hill , who had turned to the courts after their repeated efforts to repeal the law fell short in Congress .\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. , who wrote the controlling opinion , attempted a delicate balancing act : He said the Commerce and Necessary and Proper clauses of the Constitution can not be bent to compel Americans to buy insurance , but said it is allowed under Congress \u2019 s tax and spending powers , which are broader , but are subject to the checks of the political system .\n\u201c The Affordable Care Act \u2019 s requirement that certain in\u00addividuals pay a financial penalty for not obtaining health insurance may reasonably be characterized as a tax . Be\u00adcause the Constitution permits such a tax , it is not our role to forbid it , or to pass upon its wisdom or fairness , \u201d he wrote .\nThe court \u2019 s four Democratic-appointed justices all joined the Roberts ruling but wrote separately to say they would have allowed the individual mandate under the Commerce Clause , too .\nFour justices dissented , saying in an opinion written by Justice Antonin Scalia that the court has granted nearly unlimited authority to Congress to control Americans \u2019 lives .\n\u201c Whatever may be the conceptual limits upon the Commerce Clause and upon the power to tax and spend , they can not be such as will enable the Federal Government to regulate all private conduct and to compel the states to function as administrators of federal programs , \u201d Justice Scalia wrote .\nThey said they would have struck down not only the individual mandate but the rest of the law as well , arguing that the other provisions could not have stood without the compulsion of forcing Americans to buy insurance .\nChief Justice Roberts \u2018 ruling also upheld the law \u2019 s massive expansion of Medicaid , but said states can not be compelled to expand their own programs through the threat of removing federal funding altogether . Instead , states have the choice of expanding and collecting new federal money , or staying at current coverage and federal funding levels .\nThe political fight was already ramping up Thursday morning , with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell saying the court has stripped away the pretense and exposed the tax increases in the law .\n\u201c The Supreme Court has spoken . This law is a tax . The bill was sold to the American people on a deception , \u201d Mr. McConnell said , adding that the GOP will continue to pushing to ax the law .\n\u201c The court \u2019 s ruling doesn \u2019 t mark the end of the debate . It marks a fresh start on the road to repeal , \u201d he said .\nAnd Majority leader Eric Cantor said the House will vote to repeal the health care law next month , delivering on GOP promises to try to repeal the rest of the law even if the court upheld it .\n\u201c The Court \u2019 s decision brings into focus the choice the American people have about the direction of our country , \u201d he said . \u201c The president and his party believe in massive government intrusions that increase costs and take decisions away from patients . \u201d\nBut Democrats said the ruling will give them time to implement the law and sell its benefits to the public , even as they plan tweaks .\n\u201c No one thinks this law is perfect , \u201d said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , Nevada Democrat . \u201c But Democrats have proven we \u2019 re willing to work with Republicans to improve the problems that exist in this law or any other law . \u201d\nAll eyes have been on the court ever since the justices announced they would hear major constitutional challenges against the Affordable Care Act .\nThe individual mandate to buy insurance or pay a fine was at the heart of the struggle , marking the first time the federal government had tried to require all Americans to buy a particular good or service .\nWhile opponents said it violated individual freedom , the administration said since everyone consumes health care at some point , government can control when they begin to pay for it .\nThe justices held a marathon three-day series of oral arguments in March and then retreated behind closed doors to deliberate and write their opinions .\nThe conflict gave the Supreme Court a chance to try to spell out the federal government \u2019 s relationship with states and individuals more clearly than ever before , indicating where the government \u2019 s powers to tax , to regulate interstate commerce and to enact \u201c necessary and proper \u201d laws began and ended .\nVoters have been sharply polarized over the law since the beginning , and the court \u2019 s ruling is likely to dominate the presidential campaign as Mr. Obama tries to fend off presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney , who himself signed a pioneering health law as governor of Massachusetts .\nThe Supreme Court \u2019 s decision comes after more than two years of courtroom battles over the 2010 law .\nAs soon as Mr. Obama signed the law , Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli filed a lawsuit challenging the individual mandate , and in the ensuing year more than half of the states united to challenge the mandate and the bill \u2019 s massive expansion of Medicaid , which is the federal-state health program for the poor .\nThe court challenges have left the law in limbo for many .\nSome states started working on setting up their mandatory insurance exchanges .
