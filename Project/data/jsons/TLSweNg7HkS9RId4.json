The president \u2019 s son-in-law and senior adviser took the lead in promoting Mohammed bin Salman as a Saudi visionary , and persuaded the administration to hitch US Middle East policy to the prince \u2019 s rising star .\nTogether the two thirty-something princelings , MBS and Kushner , stayed up late into the night planning to remake the map of the Middle East with bold thinking and mountains of cash . For now , however , those plans are stalled .

The new president made Riyadh the destination of his first trip abroad since taking office . In the months before , Kushner identified MBS as a potential partner . The state department and the CIA backed Mohammed bin Nayef , the incumbent crown prince at the time , but the first son-in-law insisted that he had \u201c reliable intelligence \u201d \u2013 most likely from the Israeli president , Benjamin Netanyahu , a Kushner family friend \u2013 that Mohammed Bin Salman was the man to bet on . The prophecy became self-fulfilling as wholehearted support from Washington aided Mhis rise , eventually eclipsing and replacing Nayef .\nMeanwhile , the Riyadh summit appeared to be a glittering success . Trump was flattered and feted , given a sword with which to dance in step with King Salman and his retinue . There was a flypast of nine warplanes , the most the Saudis had ever attempted , and horses alongside the limos .\nThe pageantry was backed up with substance . King Salman had gathered other Gulf Arab leaders in Riyadh to promise to fight terrorism and Iran , which both the hosts and their US guests viewed pretty much as one and the same .\nIn Riyadh , Trump also claimed that he had managed to sell the Saudis $ 110bn ( \u00a383bn ) in US-made weapons . The president cited the figure again last week to explain why he could not afford to impose sanctions on the Saudi royal family even if they were found to have murdered Khashoggi , but it was largely illusory .
