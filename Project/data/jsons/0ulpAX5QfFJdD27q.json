The first comes from those who say that life expectancy has gone up since Social Security was created , and the retirement age should go up too . Krugman notes that while life expectancy has increased , the uptick is among educated and affluent workers .

Krugman 's response is to note that the official measurement of poverty among seniors is widely seen as flawed , and flawed in a way that underestimates levels of senior poverty . While many believe the poverty rate among seniors to be 9 percent , Krugman says it 's more likely around 15 percent . And what 's more , it 's likely to increase in the years ahead as more struggling retirees enter the system .\nBut the biggest reason to expand Social Security , Krugman says , is the failure of 401 ( k ) s. `` At this point , '' Krugman writes , `` it 's clear that the shift to 401 ( k ) s was a gigantic failure . Employers took advantage of the switch to surreptitiously cut benefits ; investment returns have been far lower than workers were told to expect ; and , to be fair , many people haven \u2019 t managed their money wisely . ''\nAs a result , we \u2019 re looking at a looming retirement crisis , with tens of millions of Americans facing a sharp decline in living standards at the end of their working lives .
