But as she closes in on the primary finish line , she \u2019 s grappling with one big downside .\nIt \u2019 s what one top aide referred to as \u201c Delegate Hell . \u201d\nThousands of high-powered Clinton loyalists across the country who have worked hard for the Democratic front-runner now expect to be chosen as \u201c at large \u201d delegates or PLEOs ( party leaders and elected officials ) . And there aren \u2019 t enough available slots to accommodate them all , turning the process into a competitive game of musical chairs .\n\u201c For every person that gets to be a national delegate , there \u2019 s probably going to be 50 that are qualified and deserve to be delegates as well , \u201d said Gary Mauro , a longtime Clinton friend and operative who is overseeing delegate selection in Texas . \u201c We won \u2019 t make everyone happy . There just aren \u2019 t enough slots to go around . \u201d\nAcross the country , campaign operatives like Mauro are currently sifting through hundreds of applications from lawmakers , activists , union bosses and state chairs who have donated to the campaign , hosted rallies , phone-banked and door-knocked \u2014 and now expect to cast historic votes for the first female presidential nominee at the Democratic National Convention that begins July 25 .\nBut in most states , the campaign has hard choices to make . Clinton operatives said they dread the task of telling influential Democrats they will not make the cut \u2014 and they worry about alienating steadfast allies who they will need in the fall by telling them there are no floor tickets with their names on them .\n\u201c Who am I going to irritate by cutting them ? \u201d vented longtime Clinton ally Craig Smith , who is overseeing delegate selection in Florida . \u201c The mayors all want to be delegates . Whoever it is we cut , we \u2019 re going to need them in the fall . I 'm just telling everyone , I 'll do the best I can . \u201d\nEvery presidential election , campaigns face the difficult task of turning down die-hard supporters who want to participate in the biggest political event of the year with an exclusive , high-status pass to the convention floor . But this year , the problem is amplified by the fact that Clinton has virtually the entire party establishment behind her .\nIn Florida , for instance , Clinton has the active support of more than 75 percent of Democrats in the state legislature \u2014 all of whom are now hoping for a role in Philadelphia this summer . Nearly all of the state \u2019 s Democratic congressional delegation is also backing her .\nAs for Sanders \u2019 support , one of the highest-ranking Florida elected officials after Rep. Alan Grayson is a deputy mayor .\nA compounding problem : the large number of women who want a role in casting a vote for Clinton .\n\u201c The real issue this year is that every woman who has been involved in fighting for women \u2019 s rights , and women holding office , wants to be there and wants to be able to vote for the first woman to be nominated , \u201d said Mauro , who oversaw delegate selection in Texas for Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996 , and for Al Gore in 2000 . \u201c That \u2019 s the biggest problem . Every woman I \u2019 ve ever known who has been an activist wants to be there. \u201d But in Texas , Mauro is working with just 18 convention slots to fill and 19 coveted pledged elected official slots available .\nThe process is so competitive that Mauro has asked everyone interested to officially apply by sending him a semi-formal application \u2014 he described it as a brief , 300-word , college essay-style piece of writing that he wants submitted as an email \u2014 outlining what they have done for the campaign and why they should be selected as a delegate .\nIn Florida , eager Democrats are making their case to Clinton officials by selling their diversity as much as their Clinton bona fides \u2014 one woman who wants to be a delegate wrote a letter explaining that she is a retired veteran , a Latina and a lesbian , and could help fill some of the convention \u2019 s diversity goals .\nIn Ohio , according to one Clinton ally , \u201c there is some vigorous lobbying going on for the few slots that are available , \u201d including would-be delegates who are calling and emailing state party leaders to plead their case . There are only 11 slots for party leaders and elected officials in Ohio , and 18 slots for at-large delegates , which typically go to big donors or party activists who didn \u2019 t win district-level delegate spots .\n\u201c 11 slots for elected officials is tiny , compared to all of her endorsements , \u201d the Ohio-based Clinton ally said . The diversity goals of the convention make it even more difficult .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a whole lot of middle-aged white women who want to be Hillary delegates that won \u2019 t be able to , \u201d the ally said .\nThe same story is playing out in states across the country .\nIn New York , Thomas Garry , state counsel to Clinton \u2019 s campaign , is sifting through hundreds of state leaders who want a golden ticket to the political Super Bowl \u2014 with just a handful of slots to fill .\nThere are 30 total spots for party leaders and elected officials in New York . Clinton gets to fill 17 of those slots , while Sanders gets 13 . Of the state \u2019 s 54 at-large delegates , 31 will go to Clinton . And of the 21 alternate delegates , Clinton gets to choose 13 . The deadline for choosing delegates in New York is May 23 , when the state committee will vote on the names submitted .\nThe selection process there has become so frenzied that the New York delegation \u2019 s hotel block in Philadelphia is not opening until May 23 , so the 163 pledged delegates that were decided during the primary don \u2019 t book all of the rooms in advance .\nThe decisions about who gets to attend the convention as a Clinton delegate are made in part by who has worked hardest for the former secretary of state , but it \u2019 s also about filling diversity recommendations put forth by the Democratic National Committee . The goal is to show a crowd that reflects America when the television cameras pan out across the packed convention hall .\nIn New York , 28 percent of the entire delegation is supposed to be African-American ; 20 percent Latino ; 8 percent Asian and Pacific Islander ; 8 percent LGBT ; and 5 percent disabled Americans .
