He said Trump \u2019 s example was already being followed elsewhere , giving license to authoritarian leaders to crack down on the media in ways they had not previously dared to . Zeid pointed to the Cambodian leader , Hun Sen , who he said had used similar language when he closed down independent media organisations .\nIn the 20th century \u2026 feelings were stoked , directed at a vulnerable group for the sake of political gain Zeid Ra \u2019 ad al-Hussein\n\u201c The US creates a demonstration effect , which then is picked up by other countries where the leadership tends to to be more authoritarian [ in ] character or aspires to be authoritarian , \u201d he said .\nZeid has also taken on the Trump administration over its policy of separating children from their parents in migrant families arrested at the border , and Trump \u2019 s own long history of rhetoric aimed at minorities .\n\u201c When language is used in a way that focuses on groups of people who have traditionally suffered a great deal from bigotry and prejudice and chauvinism , it harked back to a period not too long ago in the 20th century when feelings were stoked , directed at a vulnerable group for the sake of political gain , \u201d he said , adding that he was referring in particular to the 1930s and the period before the first world war .\nZeid began his tenure as UN human rights commissioner in 2014 during the Obama administration and said his contacts with the state department dropped off significantly after Trump took office in January 2017 .\n\u201c The Trump administration seems to have separated itself from previous administrations in its upholding of human rights globally , \u201d Zeid said . The administration \u2019 s failure to appoint an ambassador to the Human Rights Council in Geneva , before withdrawing from the council altogether , he added , was \u201c illustrative of the lack of any deep commitment to the human rights \u201d .\nTimeline The Syrian war Show Hide Unprecedented protests demand civil liberties and the release of political prisoners after four decades of repressive rule by the Assad family .
