Check back for updates throughout the day .\nHill described Bolton as furious over the political machinations \u2014 and eager to distance himself from them .\nThat was especially clear on July 10 at the White House as Ukrainian officials met with him and other U.S. counterparts . That day , Gordon Sondland , the U.S. ambassador to the European Union , raised the possibility of the Ukrainians pursuing investigations , ostensibly of Trump political rivals such as Joe Biden .\nBolton ordered Hill to report what happened to NSC lawyer John Eisenberg .\nHill recounted that Bolton told her , in what she described as a direct quote : \u201c \u2018 You go and tell Eisenberg that I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and [ acting White House Chief of Staff Mick ] Mulvaney are cooking up on this , and you go and tell him what you 've heard and what I 've said . \u201d\nSo she went to talk to Eisenberg , another potential witness House Democrats have been eager to talk to .\nHill was not a pro-Trump ideologue when she was asked to join the new Republican administration ; she was , rather , a respected academic well-known for her expertise on Russia .\nBut that marked her as an outsider , and she was accused of being insufficiently loyal to Trump and possibly even a tool of George Soros , the liberal billionaire who is frequently a bogeyman for the right . The attacks on Hill , which she said included death threats , were similar to those leveled at Marie Yovanovitch , the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine whose ouster has been a focus of the impeachment inquiry .\nIt seemed \u201c extraordinarily easy \u201d for people to make such \u201c baseless claims , \u201d Hill said .\n\u201c My entire first year of my tenure at the National Security Council was filled with hateful calls , conspiracy theories , which has started again , frankly , as it \u2019 s been announced that I \u2019 ve been giving this deposition , accusing me of being a Soros mole in the White House , of colluding with all kinds of enemies of the president , and , you know , of various improprieties , \u201d Hill said .\nOne explanation for the motivations behind such attacks ? Hill theorized it was the \u201d business dealings of individuals who wanted to improve the investment positions inside of Ukraine itself . \u201d\nHill also said that her understanding was that Yovanovitch \u2019 s removal was because of the result \u201c of the campaign that Mr. Giuliani had set in motion . \u201d\nHill said that in the spring , amid signs that Trump was unhappy with Yovanovitch , she discussed the ambassador \u2019 s plight with Bolton , and that he looked \u201c pained . \u201d\nHe said , \u201c Rudy Giuliani is a hand grenade that is going to blow everybody up , \u201d according to Hill .\nBolton , however , \u201c made it clear that he didn \u2019 t feel that there was anything that he could personally do about this . \u201d\nBut Bolton made it clear he didn \u2019 t want U.S. officials to meet with Giuliani , and by mid-July , he appeared to be monitoring Giuliani \u2019 s activities closely , Hill said .\nSuch comments from Hill are why lawmakers have wanted to depose Bolton . But so far , he \u2019 s been resisting .\nHill described Giuliani \u2019 s efforts in Ukraine as a \u201c package of issues \u201d that included the launch of an investigation into Burisma \u2014 a company whose board included former vice president Joe Biden \u2019 s son Hunter \u2014 and aiding the \u201c business interests of his own associates . \u201d\nThose associates , Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman , were indicted on campaign finance charges shortly before Hill \u2019 s testimony .\n\u201c My jaw dropped when I saw the indictments of these two gentlemen , of Fruman and Parnas .
