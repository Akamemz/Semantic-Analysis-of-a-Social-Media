Campaigners toured from the University College London down to Parliament blasting Bruce Springsteen \u2019 s \u2018 Born in the USA \u2019 while chanting \u201c Don \u2019 t Vote Trump \u201d from an open top bus .\nWhile illegal for registered U.S. charities to work with or for presidential candidates , a spokeswoman for Avaaz denied any connection to the Hillary campaign when quizzed . Campaigners with Avaaz however , were recorded shouting , \u201c Vote for Hillary ! \u201d during the demonstration .\nA huge 88 per cent of Americans living abroad did not register to vote in the last presidential election , and Avaaz points out that \u201c this massive untapped voting block \u201d is much more likely to be \u201c progressive \u201d because \u201c 56 per cent of us [ in the UK ] have masters degrees \u201d and overwhelmingly donated to Democratic candidates in the last three presidential primaries .\nIn a press release , Avaaz references a new Oxford University study that found \u201c America \u2019 s overseas voters\u2026 could decide the US presidency in 2016 \u201d . When combined , the potential 8 million voters around the world , \u201c would make up the 13th largest state \u201d , they say .\nJust 12 per cent of Americans abroad were registered to vote in 2012 , and \u201c the reason they don \u2019 t vote is that it \u2019 s a complicated process for them to register from abroad and many Americans miss the deadline \u201d , Meredith Alexander , the Campaigns Director for Avaaz , told Breitbart London .\nHer charity , which has also campaigned for \u201c refugee rights \u201d and against Brexit , claims to have \u201c enlisted over 30 million people around the world to share \u201d a new \u201c super easy \u201d tool enabling left wing American expats to register to vote quickly en mass .\nThe 8 million Americans abroad almost never vote . This dead easy tool can fix that but only if we make it famous : https : //t.co/z4l7lekdub \u2014 Avaaz ( @ Avaaz ) September 13 , 2016\n\u201c Avaaz has created the world \u2019 s first , global , citizen \u2019 s get-out-the-vote drive \u201d , Ms. Alexander added . \u201c The more people that share it on Facebook , the more Americans abroad will see it , and the more we will be able to stop the global threat of Trump \u201d .\nThe group chose London for the launch as the UK has the \u201c largest concentration of US expats outside of North America \u201d , and at the event several Americans registered to vote before the media to prove how easy it is with Avaaz \u2019 s new tool .\n\u201c For months , the world has sat on the sidelines , horrified by Trump \u2019 s hate . Now , global citizens have a way to fight back \u201d , Emma Ruby-Sachs , Deputy Director of Avaaz added .\nThe charity \u2019 s website encourages people to email potential U.S. voters in other countries , giving them a template that reads :\n\u201c 8 million Americans abroad could defeat Trump\u2026 if they vote !
