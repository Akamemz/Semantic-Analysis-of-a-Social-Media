    "content": "The Trump administration has maintained from the start that it ordered the assassination of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in order to forestall an imminent threat to American lives .\nIt \u2019 s pretty clear this is not true , that the administration instead simply made a calculated decision to escalate American pushback on Iran as part of a larger series of back-and-forth actions that began with the US pullout from the Iran nuclear deal .\nAnd though the deception involved has been fairly widely reported in the press , it hasn \u2019 t played a leading role in describing the cycle of tensions . That \u2019 s a mistake . By killing a foreign country \u2019 s key leader , the US put itself in the position of facing retaliation , as Iran did with rocket attacks on US bases in Iraq earlier this week . Those attacks , thankfully , didn \u2019 t kill any Americans . The Trump administration , thankfully , agreed not to retaliate further , for now .\nBut it \u2019 s clear that members of the Trump administration are not in complete agreement on Iran policy with some influential conservatives who have long pushed for a regime change in Tehran . For an administration that appears to want a war with Iran but lacks the public backing \u2014 or for a faction that wants a war but lacks the full support of the president \u2014 this is one good way to make the dream happen : provoke Iranian responses that , in turn , provoke new American responses .\nA way to halt that cycle of escalation is to insist that people who want to take provocative steps give accurate information about what they are doing .\nThere \u2019 s substantial evidence to doubt the administration \u2019 s imminent threat message .\nFor example , the Pentagon \u2019 s original press release about the Soleimani operation didn \u2019 t mention it , and the immediate US reaction was to order all American civilians out of Iraq for fear of retaliation \u2014 clearly , nobody was made safer in a direct , immediate sense .\nThose actions are consistent with a scenario in which Soleimani was a dangerous person in general , and the decision to take him out was made by policymakers seeking long-term benefits at the short-term cost of elevated risk to American lives . That \u2019 s fine as far as it goes ; sometimes in life you need short-term pain for long-term gain . But when someone asks you to suffer short-term pain , you normally ask them to explain what kind of gain they \u2019 re promising so you can consider whether it \u2019 s a fair deal .\nThe administration , instead , said it was heading off imminent attacks even as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo conceded that he couldn \u2019 t say where or when these attacks were supposed to happen .\nPompeo insists the ideas that Soleimani presented an `` imminent '' threat but the administration does n't know when or where he planned to strike are `` completely consistent thoughts .
