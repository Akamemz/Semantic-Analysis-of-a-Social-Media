    "content": "BEDFORD , N.H. \u2014 Marco Rubio isn \u2019 t really a robot \u2014 he isn \u2019 t dumb or teleprompter-tied \u2014 but he is a calculating and cautious candidate , and in the mean , fast-moving 2016 primary , caution can sometimes kill .\nGloss , discipline , natural speaking talent and planning have been the hallmarks of Rubio \u2019 s methodical presidential campaign , positioning him for a surprise third-place win in Iowa and a possible surge here on Tuesday . Rubio knows his path to his party \u2019 s nomination is narrow \u2014 a needle-thread between the tea party and establishment wings of a divided GOP \u2014 but he \u2019 s also a fundamentally risk-averse politician who often seeks the safety of a script , as his mechanical recitation of the same anti-Obama talking points four times at the final debate before the primary here painfully revealed .\n\u201c It was bizarre , man ; why did he keep saying the same thing over and over and over ? \u201d said a GOP operative who is close to Rubio \u2019 s Washington-based campaign team . \u201c It was like looking at your iPhone and the video freezes and says it \u2019 s buffering . Weird . \u201d\nRubio is facing a coming-of-age dilemma that nearly every serious presidential contender faces as they seek to rise to the top tier of a campaign \u2014 discovering that their greatest strength can be transformed into an exploitable weakness by a withering primary process and predatory opponents .\nThe 44-year-old Florida senator \u2019 s approach echoes the disciplined , optimistic message of generational change espoused by Barack Obama in 2008 ( even Rubio \u2019 s aides privately make the comparison ) , but opponents have detected a vulnerability in Rubio that Obama never suffered from \u2014 a lack of audacity and propensity for reaching for a bottle of water when the spotlight is brightest .\n\u201c When the lights go on , I told you he wouldn \u2019 t be ready , \u201d New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie , who led Saturday night \u2019 s debate drubbing of Rubio , said at a town hall meeting Sunday in Hampton , New Hampshire . \u201c Well , the lights were bright last night , and all of America saw who \u2019 s ready and who \u2019 s not . I am . He \u2019 s not . \u201d\nRubio mentor-turned-rival Jeb Bush , speaking on \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s \u201c Off Message \u201d podcast , suggested that lack of experience is the problem : If Rubio had more seasoning and less ambition he would be more capable of rolling with the punches . \u201c I 've always thought he was gifted , \u201d said Bush . \u201c He is charismatic . He lights up a room . He has an extraordinary message to tell , all of which is something to be admired \u2026 [ But ] he 's never been challenged in his life \u2026 He 's young . \u201d\nAdded one top adviser to another one of Rubio \u2019 s GOP presidential rivals . \u201c He \u2019 s anal , he \u2019 s a planner and the way to get under his skin is to knock him off script , \u201d the aide said . \u201c He doesn \u2019 t react well when circumstances shift . Christie is a bully and understands that instinctively , just as [ Donald ] Trump gets Jeb \u2019 s weakness . \u201d\nStill , Rubio \u2019 s slow-and-steady approach \u2014 laying low while Trump duked it out with a succession of sparring partners \u2014 was partly vindicated by his surprisingly strong third-place finish in Iowa , which has translated to a small but noticeable bump in the polls here . It \u2019 s also put a target on Rubio \u2019 s back , among the three governors seeking to secure the center-right space he occupies \u2014 Christie , Bush and Ohio Gov . John Kasich .\nAnd while the press and pundits , gathered in Manchester like bees buzzing around a hive , declared the Rubio robot moment a possible turning point in the race , his team offered a collective shrug . \u201c This is not a campaign falling apart when we have to turn people away at the door . \u2026 Four times , Rubio reminded you how much you hate that son of a bitch Barack Obama . If you are a regular Republican voter , that is a message you are amenable to , \u201d said Florida Republican consultant and Rubio supporter Rick Wilson .\n\u201c Undisciplined candidates fall apart , \u201d Wilson added . \u201c Barack Obama \u2014 I disagree with his message , but he was an extraordinarily disciplined candidate in 2008 , and he won . \u201d\nAnother Rubio backer said \u201c yeah , sure some of the performance antics weren \u2019 t right \u2014 but the core message is right . \u201d\nStill , the weak performance now raises the real possibility that New Hampshire will not narrow the establishment lane of this contest as so many Republicans expected , and hoped .\nThe twofold question now confronting the campaign : Will Rubio \u2019 s mistake resonate with New Hampshire voters ? And how will it play with the party \u2019 s big-money donors at a time when many deep-pocketed supporters were just about ready to move their support to the boyish Cuban-American senator ?\nRubio strategist Todd Harris , holding a call with campaign donors before the debate , told them to expect other Republicans to try to beat him up .\nRubio managed to raise a solid $ 500,000 online after the debate \u2014 but Harris \u2019 pep talk did little to reassure the party \u2019 s establishment elites . Rubio \u2019 s finance operation is aggressively trying to court Bush donors to make the case that voters are coalescing around the Florida Republican and that he would be the establishment-lane candidate . But Rubio \u2019 s subpar debate performance has all but stopped any of that momentum . One veteran Republican bundler said the donor class would be \u201c frozen in place \u201d until after Tuesday \u2019 s primary .\nSo far , the campaign has adopted a stay-the-course mentality : Rubio \u2019 s operation didn \u2019 t hold any major donor or supporter calls to discuss Rubio \u2019 s performance at the debate , and one top bundler described the overall attitude as \u201c let \u2019 s stick to the plan . \u201d\nOn Sunday , a rested and revived Rubio made passing reference to the flub \u2014 and then , like a bungee cord snapping back , returned to the same message that brought him ridicule the night before . \u201c It \u2019 s interesting that right now after last night \u2019 s debate \u2014 \u2018 Oh , you said the same thing three or four times , \u2019 \u201d he said to a crowd of around 1,000 at Londonderry High School .\n\u201c I \u2019 m going to say it again , the reason why these things are in trouble is because Barack Obama is the first president , at least in my lifetime , that wants to change the country , \u201d he added . \u201c Change the country , not fix it , not fix its problems . He wants to make it a different kind of country . \u201d\nBut later in the day \u2014 at a rally outside Manchester \u2014 he wouldn \u2019 t diverge from his script for the day , even when a little off-the-cuff remark might have softened the sting of the previous night \u2019 s embarrassment . After a town hall at a middle school , a reporter jokingly shouted , \u201c Hey senator , you don \u2019 t look like a robot ! \u201d The candidate shot a quick glance and continued to pose for his pictures . When reporters kept pelting him with softballs about his performance \u2014 \u201c Hey senator , how did you feel about the debate ? \u201d \u2014 three members of his staff lectured the press against committing acts of unsanctioned journalism \u2014 an attitude more common among candidates who have finished higher than third this year , like Hillary Clinton or Trump .\nStill , after Iowa , Rubio \u2019 s bronze medal seemed ripe for an upgrade to silver or even gold \u2014 despite Trump \u2019 s dominance in public polling . Rubio \u2019 s camp deftly worked to manage expectations in Iowa \u2014 making a strong third-place finish seem as though he had actually won . With the wind at his back , Rubio looked to capitalize on what his team called \u201c Marcomentum , \u201d doing 10 interviews in one day when he first came to New Hampshire . He \u2019 s kept up the aggressive schedule , bouncing to three events on Sunday before hosting a Super Bowl watch party .\n\u201c I think he \u2019 s actually winning ; I think he is actually moving ahead , having success .
