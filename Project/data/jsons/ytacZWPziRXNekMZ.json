    "content": "Before the pandemic began , the systems that govern our world were brittle . Today , they are broken . When we emerge , the world will be different , and so will we .\nThe journalists at \u2588\u2588\u2588 are proud to bring you trustworthy and relevant reporting about the coronavirus . To help keep this news free , become a member and sign up for our newsletter , Outbreak Today .\nI ruined the mood in a family group chat last week . Someone shared a meme that read , \u201c This # Coronavirus is turning me into a democrat . I \u2019 m staying at home , not working , complaining about everything , and waiting for a check from the government . \u201d\nAnother family member used the yearly death rate of the flu to dismiss concerns over the coronavirus . Then someone else argued that millions of people die around the world every year in car accidents . \u201c Will cars be banned , \u201d they snarkily asked . I tried not to react emotionally , but it \u2019 s hard to keep your cool after weeks of trying to convince older relatives every day to stay inside and socially distance . \u201c We \u2019 re currently at half as many American coronavirus deaths as the number of people who died on 9/11 , \u201d I replied , using the only statistic I \u2019 ve found that communicates the kind of world-changing loss that this pandemic will cause . \u201c If Dr. Fauci \u2019 s projections are correct , it will be the equivalent of 30\u201360 9/11s. \u201d The chat went quiet for a while after that . The numbers I was referring to have quickly gone out of date \u2014 they \u2019 re much higher now . But comparing this pandemic to other mass casualty , world-shaping events is the only way I know to make them resonate . As of this week , more than 5,000 Americans have died of the coronavirus \u2014 more than the 2,977 who died on September 11 , 2001 . More than any other event in my life , 9/11 changed the world : inspiring national security policies like the Patriot Act , jump-starting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan \u2014 the latter of which has become the longest-running war in US history \u2014 and leading to the creation of the Transportation Security Administration , Immigration and Customs Enforcement , and the Department of Homeland Security , effectively militarizing the United States \u2019 borders and immigration services . On Sunday , Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , said , optimistically , if we continue practicing social distancing , between 100,000 and 200,000 Americans would die of COVID-19 , the disease caused by the novel coronavirus . Projections are always bounded by inaccuracies ( and there have been plenty in the past few months ) \u2014 but if Fauci were correct , the death toll would be as if there were a 9/11 attack every day for the next two to three months . My grandmother was born in 1928 ; she spent the first 10 years of her life living through the Great Depression in the Oklahoma Dust Bowl and the last five years of her life hoarding food until it rotted in her fridge and pantry . The trauma never left . Neither will the trauma of thousands upon thousands of deaths once it \u2019 s safe to leave our homes . When we emerge , we will be different people in a different world .\n\u201c The Authoritarian Creep \u201d If China \u2019 s claim to have won supremacy over the virus is to be believed , the country was able to make up for a botched early response by mobilizing its vast and intricate surveillance infrastructure to carry out an authoritarian crackdown , the terrifying scale of which is only matched by the terrifying fear among Western liberals that it was necessary . Payment apps like Alipay and WeChat installed software to track users ' movements . China \u2019 s state-run telecom color-coded users \u2019 phones in red , green , and yellow , based on their risk of possible infection \u2014 which were then checked by guards at train stations . Those who broke quarantine were reported to the police . Chinese social media platforms like Weibo and WeChat were heavily censored to quell conspiracy theories and rumors . Those efforts may be working . The country is reporting that its case numbers are decreasing , and it has banned virtually all foreigners from entering the country as it attempts to return to normal without a second spike . Yet it \u2019 s hard to know exactly how real the claims are that China has flattened its curve . Three US officials told Bloomberg on Wednesday that the US intelligence community had concluded China \u2019 s numbers are actually much higher than what \u2019 s been reported . But with the US and Europe struggling to contain the outbreak , analysts have started asking whether China will emerge from this pandemic as the new global superpower . Jeremy Lee Wallace , a Cornell professor and leader of the university \u2019 s China 's Cities research group , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 the country is definitely attempting to position itself as a new global leader amid the pandemic . \u201c [ China ] styled itself a leader in climate change and international trade following the election of Donald Trump and is proudly boasting of its successes in fighting COVID-19 , \u201d Wallace said . \u201c Whether it will work depends on the outcomes in other countries and how those outcomes are perceived. \u201d Presenting itself as a responsible custodian is now central to the Chinese Communist Party \u2019 s propaganda strategy . Chinese diplomats and state media outlets are sparring directly with President Donald Trump \u2019 s own ad hoc online army on platforms like Twitter and YouTube , criticizing the US for its inability to mitigate the damage of the outbreak . Jack Ma , the Chinese billionaire cofounder of the multinational tech company Alibaba Group , recently tweeted two photos of medical supplies being loaded onto a China Cargo Airlines flight . \u201c The first shipment of masks and coronavirus test kits to the US is taking off from Shanghai . All the best to our friends in America , \u201d Ma wrote . According to the Jack Ma Foundation , the shipment contained 500,000 testing kits and 1 million masks . Ma \u2019 s foundations have already claimed to have shipped 1.8 million masks and 100,000 test kits to other heavily affected countries . Chinese state media is very aware it \u2019 s a Chinese billionaire shipping tests and masks around the world , not an American one . \u201c China has shared its experience , but many Western countries are just not willing to follow . When the pandemic is over , these countries will find that it was not China that had led to the severe conditions in the US and Europe , but their own wrong judgments and choices , \u201d the Global Times wrote Wednesday . David Jacobson , professor of global business strategy at Southern Methodist University 's Cox School of Business and a visiting professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 he worries China \u2019 s test-and-mask diplomacy could fall apart , citing reports of European countries sending back faulty equipment . \u201c In the world of the Communist Party state propaganda , which is probably the most powerful arm right now because it 's trying to globally set the narrative of how China 's viewed , they 're saying , \u2018 We 're here to help , we learned all these lessons , and we 're here to help the world. \u2019 \u201d he said . Jacobson said he \u2019 s optimistic that countries will see through the spin . \u201c The world is seeing the sham , \u201d he said . \u201c If the tests do n't work , test diplomacy does n't work. \u201d But it \u2019 s not just in an ascendant China \u2014 an authoritarian COVID-19 creep is on the rise everywhere . NPR called semi-authoritarian city-state Singapore a \u201c coronavirus model. \u201d The country flattened its curve by setting up early proactive measures like a virus-fighting task force , strict hospital and home quarantines , and a ban on large gatherings . It also used a technique called contact tracing , building a movement log of the infected through surveillance footage , digital signatures left by ATM card withdrawals or credit card payments , and a Bluetooth-tracking smartphone app called TraceTogether . The European Union now has its first dictatorship . On Monday , the Hungarian Parliament passed a bill giving Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n the right to rule by decree indefinitely , establishing a COVID-19 state of emergency without a time limit , suspending both Parliament and elections , and instituting prison time for spreading \u201c fake news \u201d or rumors . Countries like Israel , Italy , and Austria are working with their telecommunications networks to use anonymized location data to track people in infection hot spots and monitor if citizens are breaking stay-in-place orders . Russia is using its massive 170,000-camera facial recognition system to catch people who violate quarantine and self-isolation . Hong Kong has deployed electronic bracelets for those who test positive for the virus . Turkmenistan \u2019 s state-controlled media outlets are no longer allowed to use the word \u201c coronavirus , \u201d and it has been removed from health information brochures . India has been particularly aggressive about containing the pandemic and tracking the infected . The country has experimented with stamping people who have been infected with ink that doesn \u2019 t wash off for weeks . The Indian central government is seeking a ruling from the country \u2019 s Supreme Court that would force all media outlets to receive approval to print , publish , or telecast content about COVID-19 . And in the country \u2019 s southern state of Karnataka , quarantined people are now required to download an app on their phones , through which they must take and send a selfie \u2014 which includes GPS coordinates in its metadata \u2014 every hour to government officials . US companies like Facebook and Google are discussing how to track infection hot spots using anonymized location data , while American leaders are asking if the coronavirus is the kind of emergency that requires setting aside privacy and civil liberties .\n\u201c A Greater Depression \u201d The immediate effects of the pandemic \u2014 postponed weddings , canceled vacations , empty supermarket shelves , sinking housing prices , salary cuts , layoffs \u2014 suggest no one will come out of this period without losing something . But we are only at the beginning . Predicting how bad things will get economically is difficult . A viral outbreak of this scale has only happened once before in the industrialized world : the 1918 influenza pandemic that hit the world in two seasonal waves , killing 50 million people worldwide and 675,000 in the US . That pandemic occurred during World War I , which makes it hard to compare to now , even setting aside all the other changes in the past century . But according to a 2007 research paper on the economic effects of the 1918 pandemic , published by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis , the economic effects of the outbreak only lasted for a short time . \u201c Many businesses , especially those in the service and entertainment industries , suffered double-digit losses in revenue , \u201d the paper read . \u201c Society as a whole recovered from the 1918 influenza quickly , but individuals who were affected by the influenza had their lives changed forever . Given our highly mobile and connected society , any future influenza pandemic is likely to be more severe in its reach , and perhaps in its virulence. \u201d While the 1918 pandemic isn \u2019 t a perfect comparison to the modern coronavirus pandemic , Kevin Kruse , a history professor at Princeton University , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that last century 's outbreak exacerbated national problems that were already building up . \u201c The 1918 flu was part of a broader wave of disruptions and crises that rocked America . The spike in unemployment and inflation after World War I , the 1919 \u2018 bloody summer \u2019 of race riots , major labor strikes that fall , the First Red Scare that winter , \u201d Kruse said . \u201c There was such a national sense of unease and uncertainty. \u201d Two months into this current outbreak , massive layoffs have started , American industries have demanded bailouts , and unemployment rates have surged . Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis are projecting total employment reductions of 47 million \u2014 an unemployment rate of 32.1 % . According to Forbes , every sector of the American economy is shrinking : Hotel chain Marriott International is furloughing tens of thousands of workers , Landry \u2019 s , the parent company of Del Frisco \u2019 s and Bubba Gump Shrimp , laid off 40,000 workers . Air Canada plans to lay off 5,100 members of its cabin crew . Shoe retailer DSW put 80 % of its workers on a temporary unpaid leave of absence . The US news industry \u2019 s advertising spending is in free fall . Digital outlets like BuzzFeed and Vice have already announced salary cuts , and the mass media company Gannett \u2014 which owns titles like USA Today , the Arizona Republic , and the Des Moines Register \u2014 announced many staffers will be furloughed for five days a month through June . The news media may receive low-interest loans , but airlines will receive nearly $ 60 billion in financial assistance as part of the Coronavirus Aid , Relief , and Economic Security ( CARES ) Act , which Trump signed into law last Friday , but there are already questions from industry leaders about whether that \u2019 s enough to keep the industry aloft . Luigi Zingales , a finance professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and cohost of the podcast Capitalisn \u2019 t , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that we don \u2019 t know yet how effective the CARES Act will be but added it was n't targeted at the right industries . \u201c I see this as purely an electoral move , which is not justified from an economic point of view , \u201d he said . \u201c The goal of the package is to redistribute and preserve the existing production capacity of the US economy. \u201d He said one immediate issue is that no one knows how it will help gig workers , which make up about 7 % of the country \u2019 s total employment . \u201c My understanding is basically nobody knows , \u201d he said . \u201c Imagine I work as a cab driver and through this program I get paid my regular wage , but I work as an Uber driver and I get nothing. \u201d American workers are already reacting to this economic downturn , striking and protesting . More fundamentally , the way we understand labor and class in this country is changing more than it has since the Great Depression .\n\u201c A Divided America \u201d On Monday , a group of workers walked off the job at an Amazon warehouse in Staten Island . An Amazon employee named Chris Smalls claimed the company fired him after he led a protest against its safety conditions . On Tuesday , Whole Foods Market workers held a \u201c sick-out. \u201d Members of the Industrial Division of Communication Workers of America protested Monday at the General Electric aviation facility in Lynn , Massachusetts , as well as its headquarters in Boston , demanding the company use its manufacturing resources to build more ventilators . Health care workers are protesting as well . Nurses across the country have begun to protest the shortages of personal protective equipment , which they say are putting their lives at risk . National Nurses United held a rally in front of Alta Bates Summit Medical Center in Oakland earlier this month . Last Saturday , more than two dozen nurses protested in front of Jacobi Hospital in the Bronx . And the fact that major American cities , including New York , Boston , Los Angeles , San Francisco , and St. Louis , have temporarily banned evictions hasn \u2019 t quelled the rumblings of a nationwide rent strike . Rent Strike 2020 , the activist organization leading the push , is demanding a two-month freeze on the collection of rent , residential mortgages , and utility bills \u201c to allow working families to do what is necessary to prepare for the difficult social measures required to flatten the outbreak curve , \u201d the organization \u2019 s website reads . Peter Gowan , a researcher and resident fellow at the Democracy Collaborative 's Next System Project , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that many Americans are learning that a lot of the economic policies they were told couldn \u2019 t be done following the 2008 financial crisis are actually possible . \u201c You were seeing people say it 's impossible to think about giving cash payments to everyone , it 's impossible to increase unemployment benefits , that it 's impossible to have the government tell companies what they need to be producing , \u201d Gowan said . \u201c But now you 're seeing the Democratic Party and parts of the Republican Party telling President Trump that he needs to use the Defense Production Act to increase the production of ventilators. \u201d But it \u2019 s not just strikes and protests ; TikTok videos demonstrating Mark Zuckerberg 's coronavirus donation \u2014 $ 25 million \u2014 compared to his total wealth \u2014 $ 55.1 billion \u2014 and the immediate public disgust at actor Gal Gadot \u2019 s star-studded \u201c Imagine '' video reveal how quickly the pandemic has torn open the seams of American class consciousness . \u201c I hope that in the coming months and years that we 'll see a revitalized labor movement , \u201d Gowan said . \u201c I hope the left , and people in general , internalize that a lot of the things you 're told are rules are actually just norms created for the preservation of property and the rights of capital. \u201d Even though the way Americans think about the structure of their society and the value of labor is changing quickly , there are still two outbreaks in the US : One is a minor inconvenience suffered by the rich , who can abandon heavily affected urban areas for second homes , escape to \u201c virus-free \u201d retreats , and all seem to be getting tests . And there is a second outbreak , where delivery drivers and retail employees work under the constant threat of infection , where nurses have to use bleach to clean and reuse face masks , and where parking lots in Las Vegas are turned into homeless shelters , complete with spray-painted social distancing markers . Things are even worse for the incarcerated . At the Cook County Jail in Chicago , 134 inmates tested positive for COVID-19 this week . According to one legal organization \u2019 s analysis , coronavirus infections in New York City \u2019 s largest jail have skyrocketed to nearly 10 times the rate of the city \u2019 s residents . We are teetering dangerously close to a viral bomb going off inside ICE detention centers . A medical worker and a detainee have both tested positive for COVID-19 at a New Jersey facility earlier this month ; last week , three unaccompanied immigrant children in the custody of a US refugee agency in New York tested positive for the virus . On Sunday , Trump walked back his Easter deadline for turning the economy back on , but the recent push to go back to work \u2014 pandemic or not \u2014 is still being trumpeted by prominent Republicans and right-wing media . As Trump continues prioritizing the market over human lives , his administration \u2019 s Lord of the Flies approach has left the country \u2019 s governors scrambling to fill in the gaps left by a impotent federal government \u2014 a grim fulfillment of writer James Fallows ' prediction last year that America would soon be heading toward the disintegration that marked the end of the Roman Empire . Conspiracy theorists and far-right extremists are experimenting with how to use the coronavirus to their advantage . The QAnon movement and many other misinformation communities , like 5G truthers and anti-vaxxers have have been more active , latching on to the pandemic as proof of their paranoid worldviews . Tom Kawczynski , a white nationalist in Maine , is hosting a daily Coronavirus Central podcast that has been in Apple \u2019 s top 20 podcasts under the \u201c Health & Fitness \u201d category since the outbreak began . Last week , an international white supremacist group called the Hundred-Handers created a Twitter account claiming to be the regional arm of climate change activist group Extinction Rebellion ; it tweeted photos of a fake campaign promoting the coronavirus as a natural \u201c cure \u201d to the human \u201c disease. \u201d We will exit this pandemic with a new understanding of how both our government and society work . Formerly fringe ideas on the left like universal basic income or universal health care are now household terms , online misinformation and disinformation are no longer abstract concepts but constant presences in our group chats , and malicious ideologies like ecofascism are taking root . We will need new stories , but it \u2019 s unclear who will tell them and how .\n\u201c We Live Online Now \u201d Right now , for one of the first times in modern history , huge swaths of the Earth \u2019 s population are being told to stay indoors . Workers who can conduct business remotely are . Group videoconferencing platforms like Zoom and Houseparty have blossomed . We spend our days switching back and forth between different inboxes , emails , family group chats , Slack messages , WhatsApp groups , and Instagram DMs \u2014 the bad screen and the good screen are now the same screen . There is a strong possibility we will not suddenly revert back to full offices when the world turns back on . Christopher McKnight Nichols , history professor and director of the Center for the Humanities at Oregon State University , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the 1918 pandemic \u2019 s biggest impact on American media was how seriously the press began to take public trust following the outbreak . \u201c The lessons learned were largely about [ news ] coverage when the federal government is suppressing honest , open speech , \u201d Nichols said . \u201c There were rampant false cures and treatments peddled by large firms as well as those who could best be understood as charlatans . Attempting to crack down on advertising of some of this false medicine was a result. \u201d This wave of mistrust is happening now as well . Except \u2014 contrary to the countless pieces fretting about an end to globalization , which cite the general breakdown in the rule-based global order and the deteriorating relationship between the US and China \u2014 we \u2019 re combating misinformation on a global scale we \u2019 ve never seen before . As the pandemic left China , an unverified video of a Chinese nurse overreporting the virus \u2019 s death toll spread from Chinese messaging platform WeChat to Twitter , where it was subtitled in English and then shared in huge numbers on YouTube . The same hoax about helicopters being used to disinfect cities was spotted in Italy , the Netherlands , the US , Turkey , and Argentina by fact-checkers . ( While in Mumbai , workers really were being sprayed with an unknown chemical disinfectant . ) Twitter 's US-based moderation team took down two of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro 's tweets on Sunday for promoting the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine , which Trump has touted as a possible COVID-19 cure . By removing the ability to meet in person , by shuttering traditional entertainment , and because we are facing an increasingly undeniable and inescapable existential terror , the internet has become a global monoculture . But it \u2019 s not all hoaxes and conspiracy theories . The two most viral songs about the coronavirus outbreak are from Vietnam and the Dominican Republic . We go online to commiserate about whatever \u2019 s on Netflix ( even if it \u2019 s a seven-part docuseries about a gay zookeeper who was arrested for murder-for-hire ) or argue with each other about whether New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo is hot ( or has nipple piercings ) . This is not totally different to how we lived before \u2014 except there \u2019 s nothing else now .",

Projections are always bounded by inaccuracies (and there have been plenty in the past few months) \u2014 but if Fauci were correct, the death toll would be as if there were a 9/11 attack every day for the next two to three months.

The trauma never left. Neither will the trauma of thousands upon thousands of deaths once it\u2019s safe to leave our homes. When we emerge, we will be different people in a different world.\n\nNoel Celis / Getty Images A child wearing a face mask looks over a barricade in Wuhan, China, April 2. Rows of plastic barriers prevented movement throughout the city while it was under total lockdown.\n\n\u201cThe Authoritarian Creep\u201d If China\u2019s claim to have won supremacy over the virus is to be believed, the country was able to make up for a botched early response by mobilizing its vast and intricate surveillance infrastructure to carry out an authoritarian crackdown, the terrifying scale of which is only matched by the terrifying fear among Western liberals that it was necessary. Payment apps like Alipay and WeChat installed software to track users' movements. China\u2019s state-run telecom color-coded users\u2019 phones in red, green, and yellow, based on their risk of possible infection \u2014 which were then checked by guards at train stations. Those who broke quarantine were reported to the police. Chinese social media platforms like Weibo and WeChat were heavily censored to quell conspiracy theories and rumors. Those efforts may be working. The country is reporting that its case numbers are decreasing, and it has banned virtually all foreigners from entering the country as it attempts to return to normal without a second spike.

Turkmenistan\u2019s state-controlled media outlets are no longer allowed to use the word \u201ccoronavirus,\u201d and it has been removed from health information brochures. India has been particularly aggressive about containing the pandemic and tracking the infected. The country has experimented with stamping people who have been infected with ink that doesn\u2019t wash off for weeks. The Indian central government is seeking a ruling from the country\u2019s Supreme Court that would force all media outlets to receive approval to print, publish, or telecast content about COVID-19. And in the country\u2019s southern state of Karnataka, quarantined people are now required to download an app on their phones, through which they must take and send a selfie \u2014 which includes GPS coordinates in its metadata \u2014 every hour to government officials. US companies like Facebook and Google are discussing how to track infection hot spots using anonymized location data, while American leaders are asking if the coronavirus is the kind of emergency that requires setting aside privacy and civil liberties.\n\nJustin Sullivan / Getty Images A pigeon crosses an empty Powell Street during the coronavirus pandemic in San Francisco, March 30.\n\n\u201cA Greater Depression\u201d The immediate effects of the pandemic \u2014 postponed weddings, canceled vacations, empty supermarket shelves, sinking housing prices, salary cuts, layoffs \u2014 suggest no one will come out of this period without losing something. But we are only at the beginning. Predicting how bad things will get economically is difficult. A viral outbreak of this scale has only happened once before in the industrialized world: the 1918 influenza pandemic that hit the world in two seasonal waves, killing 50 million people worldwide and 675,000 in the US. That pandemic occurred during World War I, which makes it hard to compare to now, even setting aside all the other changes in the past century. But according to a 2007 research paper on the economic effects of the 1918 pandemic, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the economic effects of the outbreak only lasted for a short time. \u201cMany businesses, especially those in the service and entertainment industries, suffered double-digit losses in revenue,\u201d the paper read. \u201cSociety as a whole recovered from the 1918 influenza quickly, but individuals who were affected by the influenza had their lives changed forever. Given our highly mobile and connected society, any future influenza pandemic is likely to be more severe in its reach, and perhaps in its virulence.\u201d While the 1918 pandemic isn\u2019t a perfect comparison to the modern coronavirus pandemic, Kevin Kruse, a history professor at Princeton University, told BuzzFeed News that last century's outbreak exacerbated national problems that were already building up. \u201cThe 1918 flu was part of a broader wave of disruptions and crises that rocked America. The spike in unemployment and inflation after World War I, the 1919 \u2018bloody summer\u2019 of race riots, major labor strikes that fall, the First Red Scare that winter,\u201d Kruse said. \u201cThere was such a national sense of unease and uncertainty.\u201d Two months into this current outbreak, massive layoffs have started, American industries have demanded bailouts, and unemployment rates have surged. Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis are projecting total employment reductions of 47 million \u2014 an unemployment rate of 32.1%. According to Forbes, every sector of the American economy is shrinking: Hotel chain Marriott International is furloughing tens of thousands of workers, Landry\u2019s, the parent company of Del Frisco\u2019s and Bubba Gump Shrimp, laid off 40,000 workers. Air Canada plans to lay off 5,100 members of its cabin crew. Shoe retailer DSW put 80% of its workers on a temporary unpaid leave of absence. The US news industry\u2019s advertising spending is in free fall. Digital outlets like BuzzFeed and Vice have already announced salary cuts, and the mass media company Gannett \u2014 which owns titles like USA Today, the Arizona Republic, and the Des Moines Register \u2014 announced many staffers will be furloughed for five days a month through June. The news media may receive low-interest loans, but airlines will receive nearly $60 billion in financial assistance as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which Trump signed into law last Friday, but there are already questions from industry leaders about whether that\u2019s enough to keep the industry aloft. Luigi Zingales, a finance professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business and cohost of the podcast Capitalisn\u2019t, told BuzzFeed News that we don\u2019t know yet how effective the CARES Act will be but added it wasn't targeted at the right industries. \u201cI see this as purely an electoral move, which is not justified from an economic point of view,\u201d he said. \u201cThe goal of the package is to redistribute and preserve the existing production capacity of the US economy.\u201d He said one immediate issue is that no one knows how it will help gig workers, which make up about 7% of the country\u2019s total employment. \u201cMy understanding is basically nobody knows,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine I work as a cab driver and through this program I get paid my regular wage, but I work as an Uber driver and I get nothing.\u201d American workers are already reacting to this economic downturn, striking and protesting. More fundamentally, the way we understand labor and class in this country is changing more than it has since the Great Depression.\n\nPeople are shown in social-distancing boxes at a temporary homeless shelter set up in a parking lot in Las Vegas, Nevada.

An Amazon employee named Chris Smalls claimed the company fired him after he led a protest against its safety conditions. On Tuesday, Whole Foods Market workers held a \u201csick-out.\u201d Members of the Industrial Division of Communication Workers of America protested Monday at the General Electric aviation facility in Lynn, Massachusetts, as well as its headquarters in Boston, demanding the company use its manufacturing resources to build more ventilators. Health care workers are protesting as well. Nurses across the country have begun to protest the shortages of personal protective equipment, which they say are putting their lives at risk. National Nurses United held a rally in front of Alta Bates Summit Medical Center in Oakland earlier this month. Last Saturday, more than two dozen nurses protested in front of Jacobi Hospital in the Bronx. And the fact that major American cities, including New York, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and St. Louis, have temporarily banned evictions hasn\u2019t quelled the rumblings of a nationwide rent strike. Rent Strike 2020, the activist organization leading the push, is demanding a two-month freeze on the collection of rent, residential mortgages, and utility bills \u201cto allow working families to do what is necessary to prepare for the difficult social measures required to flatten the outbreak curve,\u201d the organization\u2019s website reads. Peter Gowan, a researcher and resident fellow at the Democracy Collaborative's Next System Project, told BuzzFeed News that many Americans are learning that a lot of the economic policies they were told couldn\u2019t be done following the 2008 financial crisis are actually possible. \u201cYou were seeing people say it's impossible to think about giving cash payments to everyone, it's impossible to increase unemployment benefits, that it's impossible to have the government tell companies what they need to be producing,\u201d Gowan said. \u201cBut now you're seeing the Democratic Party and parts of the Republican Party telling President Trump that he needs to use the Defense Production Act to increase the production of ventilators.\u201d But it\u2019s not just strikes and protests; TikTok videos demonstrating Mark Zuckerberg's coronavirus donation \u2014 $25 million \u2014 compared to his total wealth \u2014 $55.1 billion \u2014 and the immediate public disgust at actor Gal Gadot\u2019s star-studded \u201cImagine\" video reveal how quickly the pandemic has torn open the seams of American class consciousness. \u201cI hope that in the coming months and years that we'll see a revitalized labor movement,\u201d Gowan said. \u201cI hope the left, and people in general, internalize that a lot of the things you're told are rules are actually just norms created for the preservation of property and the rights of capital.\u201d Even though the way Americans think about the structure of their society and the value of labor is changing quickly, there are still two outbreaks in the US: One is a minor inconvenience suffered by the rich, who can abandon heavily affected urban areas for second homes, escape to \u201cvirus-free\u201d retreats, and all seem to be getting tests. And there is a second outbreak, where delivery drivers and retail employees work under the constant threat of infection, where nurses have to use bleach to clean and reuse face masks, and where parking lots in Las Vegas are turned into homeless shelters, complete with spray-painted social distancing markers. Things are even worse for the incarcerated. At the Cook County Jail in Chicago, 134 inmates tested positive for COVID-19 this week. According to one legal organization\u2019s analysis, coronavirus infections in New York City\u2019s largest jail have skyrocketed to nearly 10 times the rate of the city\u2019s residents. We are teetering dangerously close to a viral bomb going off inside ICE detention centers. A medical worker and a detainee have both tested positive for COVID-19 at a New Jersey facility earlier this month; last week, three unaccompanied immigrant children in the custody of a US refugee agency in New York tested positive for the virus. On Sunday, Trump walked back his Easter deadline for turning the economy back on, but the recent push to go back to work \u2014 pandemic or not \u2014 is still being trumpeted by prominent Republicans and right-wing media. As Trump continues prioritizing the market over human lives, his administration\u2019s Lord of the Flies approach has left the country\u2019s governors scrambling to fill in the gaps left by a impotent federal government \u2014 a grim fulfillment of writer James Fallows' prediction last year that America would soon be heading toward the disintegration that marked the end of the Roman Empire. Conspiracy theorists and far-right extremists are experimenting with how to use the coronavirus to their advantage. The QAnon movement and many other misinformation communities, like 5G truthers and anti-vaxxers have have been more active, latching on to the pandemic as proof of their paranoid worldviews. Tom Kawczynski, a white nationalist in Maine, is hosting a daily Coronavirus Central podcast that has been in Apple\u2019s top 20 podcasts under the \u201cHealth & Fitness\u201d category since the outbreak began. Last week, an international white supremacist group called the Hundred-Handers created a Twitter account claiming to be the regional arm of climate change activist group Extinction Rebellion; it tweeted photos of a fake campaign promoting the coronavirus as a natural \u201ccure\u201d to the human \u201cdisease.\u201d We will exit this pandemic with a new understanding of how both our government and society work. Formerly fringe ideas on the left like universal basic income or universal health care are now household terms, online misinformation and disinformation are no longer abstract concepts but constant presences in our group chats, and malicious ideologies like ecofascism are taking root. We will need new stories, but it\u2019s unclear who will tell them and how.\n\nNurphoto / Getty Images A student attends an online class at home in New York City after schools closed amid the coronavirus pandemic, March 24.\n\nAndrew Caballero-reynolds / Getty Images Neighbors of cellist Jodi Beder practice social distancing and watch her perform a daily concert on her front porch in Mount Rainier, Maryland, March 30.\n\n\u201cWe Live Online Now\u201d Right now, for one of the first times in modern history, huge swaths of the Earth\u2019s population are being told to stay indoors. Workers who can conduct business remotely are. Group videoconferencing platforms like Zoom and Houseparty have blossomed. We spend our days switching back and forth between different inboxes, emails, family group chats, Slack messages, WhatsApp groups, and Instagram DMs \u2014 the bad screen and the good screen are now the same screen. There is a strong possibility we will not suddenly revert back to full offices when the world turns back on. Christopher McKnight Nichols, history professor and director of the Center for the Humanities at Oregon State University, told BuzzFeed News that the 1918 pandemic\u2019s biggest impact on American media was how seriously the press began to take public trust following the outbreak. \u201cThe lessons learned were largely about [news] coverage when the federal government is suppressing honest, open speech,\u201d Nichols said. \u201cThere were rampant false cures and treatments peddled by large firms as well as those who could best be understood as charlatans. Attempting to crack down on advertising of some of this false medicine was a result.\u201d This wave of mistrust is happening now as well. Except \u2014 contrary to the countless pieces fretting about an end to globalization, which cite the general breakdown in the rule-based global order and the deteriorating relationship between the US and China \u2014 we\u2019re combating misinformation on a global scale we\u2019ve never seen before. As the pandemic left China, an unverified video of a Chinese nurse overreporting the virus\u2019s death toll spread from Chinese messaging platform WeChat to Twitter, where it was subtitled in English and then shared in huge numbers on YouTube. The same hoax about helicopters being used to disinfect cities was spotted in Italy, the Netherlands, the US, Turkey, and Argentina by fact-checkers. (While in Mumbai, workers really were being sprayed with an unknown chemical disinfectant.) Twitter's US-based moderation team took down two of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's tweets on Sunday for promoting the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which Trump has touted as a possible COVID-19 cure. By removing the ability to meet in person, by shuttering traditional entertainment, and because we are facing an increasingly undeniable and inescapable existential terror, the internet has become a global monoculture. But it\u2019s not all hoaxes and conspiracy theories. The two most viral songs about the coronavirus outbreak are from Vietnam and the Dominican Republic. We go online to commiserate about whatever\u2019s on Netflix (even if it\u2019s a seven-part docuseries about a gay zookeeper who was arrested for murder-for-hire) or argue with each other about whether New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is hot (or has nipple piercings). This is not totally different to how we lived before \u2014 except there\u2019s nothing else now.\n\nMario Tama / Getty Images Restrictions are listed for those who want to donate blood during a blood drive at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library amid the coronavirus pandemic in Yorba Linda, California, March 30.",
