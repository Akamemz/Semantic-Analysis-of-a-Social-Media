And I think in part we paid a price for not doing that in what we see happening with ISIS . \u201d\nDuring the interview , Pelley pointed out that Panetta was not the lone Obama official to urge the president to arm the Syrian rebels :\nIt turns out President Obama was urged to intervene in Syria much earlier .
