    "content": "The US State Department has released satellite photos that it says prove that Russia is using its artillery to fire into Ukrainian territory at Ukrainian military forces . Ukraine has been claiming for weeks that Russia was firing artillery across its border \u2014 an act of overt war \u2014 but the US did not confirm it until Thursday .\nIf true , this would be a major escalation by Moscow ; for Russia to use its military openly to attack Ukrainian forces would be a step beyond its prior strategy of sending in unmarked special forces and backing separatist rebels . While this is still not as significant as Russia 's invasion and annexation of Crimea in March , it is a big step up in Russia 's eastern Ukraine actions .\nWhile Ukraine says the shelling began some time before flight MH17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine , most likely by Russia-backed rebels , this report comes at a time when the world is already moving to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin for his actions .
