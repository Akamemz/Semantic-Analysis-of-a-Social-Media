    "content": "President Obama \u2019 s war Cabinet is not instilling confidence in the public about his \u201c no boots on the ground \u201d strategy to defeat the Islamic State now anchored in two countries and in more than a dozen towns .\nIn congressional testimony last week , officials \u2019 predictions for how the mission would succeed one day repeatedly were couched in big \u201c ifs . \u201d\nArmy Gen. Martin E. Dempsey , the Joint Chiefs chairman , talked about the initial phase of relying on Iraqi ground troops as some sort of trial . He said he might determine that Iraqi Security Forces need Americans fighting in close combat , not confined to distant brigade headquarters .\nSecretary of State John F. Kerry raised a scenario in which the Obama strategy fails , and it is left up to Shiite Iran to defeat the Islamic State , the brutal Sunni extremist army and an al Qaeda spinoff also known by the acronyms ISIS and ISIL .\nDefense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the whole strategy for defeating the Islamic State in Syria largely rests on a local fighting force that right now exists only on paper .\n\u201c If we don \u2019 t have ground capability in moderate opposition , yes , it affects a rather significant dimension of the overall strategy , \u201d Mr. Hagel testified .\nSEE ALSO : Canada begins revoking passports of citizens who join Islamic State\nOverall , there were no flat predictions to Congress that Iraq will be able to muster ground units capable of the gritty , persistent fighting needed to evict Islamic State terrorists , town by town , from Fallujah in the west to Mosul in the north .\nMeanwhile , the voices of military analysts \u2014 including two former Obama defense chiefs \u2014 have grown louder in criticizing the administration \u2019 s latest strategy to combat the Islamic State .\nFormer Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta told \u201c CBS Evening News \u201d that the terrorist group rose to power because the U.S. pulled out of Iraq too quickly and waited too long to intervene in Syria .\n\u201c I really thought that it was important for us to maintain a presence in Iraq , \u201d Mr. Panetta said in an interview set to air on \u201c 60 Minutes . \u201d\nMr. Panetta said the entire national security team urged Mr. Obama to give more support to rebels fighting in Syria against President Bashar Assad .\nMr. Panetta \u2019 s predecessor , former Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates , said Mr. Obama \u2019 s plan to rely on airstrikes without U.S. ground troops is doomed to failure .\n\u201c The reality is , they \u2019 re not gon na be able to be successful against ISIS strictly from the air , or strictly depending on the Iraqi forces , or the [ Kurdish ] peshmerga or the Sunni tribes acting on their own , \u201d Mr. Gates said Wednesday on \u201c This Morning \u201d on CBS . \u201c So there will be boots on the ground if there \u2019 s to be any hope of success in the strategy . And I think that by continuing to repeat that [ the U.S. won \u2019 t put boots on the ground ] , the president , in effect , traps himself . \u201d\nRetired Army Maj. Gen. Robert Scales echoed Mr. Gates \u2019 assessment , saying the Obama war Cabinet \u2019 s \u201c lack of confidence is well-founded . \u201d\n\u201c What I find so interesting is a virtually complete consensus among active , retired military and virtually every policymaker in this town that this effort will fail . This is an unprecedented lack of confidence in our military effort , \u201d Gen. Scales said .\nHe added : \u201c Kerry deflects criticism about the military prospects by emphasizing the other elements of power , such as the financial , diplomatic and political . Problem is that this enemy is virtually unique about not giving a damn about anything but fighting and killing . \u201d\nAn officer at the Pentagon said , \u201c The DOD is not clear what they can or can \u2019 t do because the White House has not yet made it clear . Therefore , DOD is confused and struggling to make a decent plan . \u201d\nAt a Senate Committee on Foreign Relations hearing , Mr. Kerry was pressed by Sen. Marco Rubio , Florida Republican , on possible outcomes . The secretary of state said the ultimate ending is unclear and that Iran may be the possible savior in defeating the Islamic State .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not going to get into hypotheticals , but you \u2019 re presuming that Iran and Syria don \u2019 t have any capacity to take on ISIL , \u201d Mr. Kerry said . \u201c I mean , who knows ? I \u2019 m not going to get \u2014 I don \u2019 t know what \u2019 s going to happen here . \u201d\nHe then raised the possibility of utter failure \u2014 and success .\n\u201c If we \u2019 re failing and failing miserably , who knows what choice they [ Syria and Iran ] might make ? You prepositioned this on the notion we \u2019 re failing . I don \u2019 t believe we \u2019 re going to fail , \u201d he said . \u201c There are lots of possibilities . There are lots of possibilities between here and there . \u201d\nAt a Senate Committee on Armed Services hearing , Gen. Dempsey was asked if Sunni tribal leaders are coming to the coalition side \u2014 a key development in making the strategy work .\n\u201c I can \u2019 t make that report yet , senator , \u201d said the four-star general , who played a major role in training the Iraqi Security Forces before U.S. troops pulled out in December 2011 .\nGen. Dempsey laid out an iffy scenario for success on the battlefield .\n\u201c We know which [ Iraqi units ] are capable of partnering and improving their capabilities , \u201d he said . \u201c If we can get enough of them to go on the offensive , both west and north , get the peshmerga to squeeze from the north to south , and then find a way over time in Syria , initially to disrupt using air power and eventually to pressure using a moderate opposition , then I think [ this will ] place ISIL in an untenable position . \u201d\nIraqi forces retreated en masse rather than stand and fight as the Islamic State \u2019 s army crossed into northern Iraq from Syria in June and swallowed up territory from Mosul in the north to Tikrit in the south .\nAsked if Iraq \u2019 s troops will not fight , Gen. Dempsey said , \u201c Yes , they will fight if they are well-led and believe that their government is looking out for not only their best interests but their families . \u201d\nArmy Col. Steve Warren , director of Pentagon press operations , said in an interview there are a \u201c number of ifs . \u201d\n\u201c The strategy really does pivot on this coalition , \u201d he said . \u201c Everybody agrees you need troops on the ground . And everybody is relying on those troops to be Iraqi troops . So that is the big \u2018 if. \u2019 Are [ the Iraq forces ] up to the task ? We don \u2019 t frankly know the answer yet . \u201d\nSince the Iraqi troops \u2019 mass retreat , Col. Warren said , \u201c The Iraqis have comported themselves better . I mean , they did manage to retake the Mosul Dam . They did good work around Haditha . They did good work around Amerli . There are some good , solid Iraqi forces . But yeah , at the end of the day , there are a number of \u2018 ifs. \u2019 There just are . But that \u2019 s all we \u2019 ve got . \u201d\nAided by U.S. airstrikes , Kurdish and Shiite militia fighters broke the Islamic State \u2019 s long siege of Amerli and its 15,000 residents earlier this month .\nGen. Scales , a highly decorated combatant in Vietnam , said Mr. Obama \u2019 s no-boots-on-the-ground edict \u201c violates virtually every tenet of modern American warfare . \u201d\nHe said U.S. Central Command has launched an air campaign that \u201c aggravates rather than damages ISIS \u201d with only a few strikes each day while the U.S. looks to \u201c unreliable allies whom we are asking to do the dying for us . \u201d",
