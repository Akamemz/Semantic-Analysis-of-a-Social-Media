All my deepest respect . \u201d\nThe U.S. Supreme Court this week approved Mr. Trump \u2019 s travel ban of targeted nations in a 7-2 ruling .\nMr. Weissmann , who as a private lawyer donated to Mr. Obama and to New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo , another Democrat , now is Mr. Mueller \u2019 s right-hand man . He oversaw the investigation of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort , including a pre-dawn FBI raid on his condo and an in-bed frisking of his wife .\nThe Weissmann emails and others from Obama political appointees praising Ms. Yates were unearthed in a Freedom of Information Act request by the conservative government watchdog Judicial Watch .\nMr. Trump fired Ms. Yates as she became a hero to Mr. Weissmann and other liberals .\nThe anti-Trump moves by Obama aides began in July 2016 during his campaign for the presidency .\nThen-FBI Director James B. Comey began a criminal investigation of the Trump campaign , in whole or part , based on a dossier financed by the Democratic Party with an aim to destroy the Republican candidate . Its salacious and sometimes far-fetched scenarios of Russia-Trump collusion on the Russian hack of Democratic Party computers have not been confirmed publicly .\nThe top FBI investigator at that time was a \u201c never Trump \u201d advocate whom Mr. Mueller removed from his team last summer , The New York Times reported .\nJohn O. Brennan , Mr. Obama \u2019 s CIA director and former campaign adviser , pushed the investigation during the campaign . He supplied Mr. Comey with the names of Russians with whom Trump associates had made any type of contact . Mr. Brennan testified to Congress that he provided the list of referrals without knowing what was discussed .\nJames R. Clapper , Mr. Obama \u2019 s director of national intelligence , has suggested that Mr. Trump is on the way out and calls him unfit for office .\n\u201c I really question his \u2026 fitness to be in this office , \u201d Mr. Clapper told CNN after a fiery Trump speech in August . \u201c And I also am beginning to wonder about his motivation for it . Maybe he is looking for a way out . \u201d\nConservatives suspect all this has happened as Obama administration holdovers and former aides were working to sabotage the Trump administration .\nSome news stories attributed to \u201c former \u201d government officials \u2014 read , Obama \u2014 have fallen into the \u201c fake news \u201d category . Journalists and Democrats are determined to show that Trump aides and Moscow collaborated .\nA major New York Times story on Feb. 14 based in part on \u201c former American officials \u201d did much to fuel this narrative .\n\u201c Phone records and intercepted calls show that members of Donald J. Trump \u2019 s 2016 presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election , according to four current and former American officials , \u201d The Times story read .\nAlmost the entire story was wrong , according to Mr. Comey \u2019 s testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence four months later . In other words , there were no such \u201c repeated contacts \u201d with Russian intelligence .\nMr. Comey testified that he was so taken aback by the story that he immediately notified senior members of Congress that it was not true .\nAnother story that seemed to rise up from Obama holdovers was the narrative that Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey in May because the FBI director had asked for more resources for a Russia-Trump investigation . Several senior Justice Department officials said no such request was made . Mr. Comey has not made that charge .\n\u201c Having experienced a change in administration while at the Pentagon in 2009 , it \u2019 s not uncommon to see passive-aggressive behavior from a handful of outgoing folks , \u201d said J.D . Gordon , a former Defense Department spokesman and Trump campaign national security adviser . \u201c That said , based on the flood of leaks across the government , what we \u2019 re seeing today more closely resembles a stealth coup . Certainly nothing passive about it . \u201d\nMr. Brennan has not shied away from depicting Mr. Trump as an awful president or disclosing his own role in driving the FBI to investigate Mr. Trump during the campaign .\n\u201c I wanted to make sure that every information and bit of intelligence that we had was shared with the [ FBI ] so that they could take it , \u201d Mr. Brennan told the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in May . \u201c It was well beyond my mandate as director of CIA to follow on any of those leads that involved U.S. persons . But I made sure that anything that was involving U.S. persons , including anything involving the individuals involved in the Trump campaign , was shared with the bureau .\n\u201c I was aware of intelligence and information about contacts between Russian officials and U.S. persons that raised concerns in my mind about whether or not those individuals were cooperating with the Russians , either in a witting or unwitting fashion , and it served as the basis for the FBI investigation to determine whether such collusion [ or ] cooperation occurred , \u201d the former CIA chief testified .\nDuring the presidential transition , Rep. Peter T. King , New York Republican , became suspicious of Mr. Brennan \u2019 s behind-the-scenes maneuvers . He said on ABC News : \u201c There should be an investigation of what the Russians did but also an investigation of John Brennan and the hit job he seems to be orchestrating against the president-elect . \u201d\nTo date , there has been no public confirmation of Trump-Russia election collusion charges .\nAny doubts that Mr. Obama \u2019 s CIA actively opposed Mr. Trump were perhaps dispelled by former acting Director Michael Morell . He endorsed Hillary Clinton in stark language in response to Mr. Trump \u2019 s comments as a candidate applauding Russian President Vladimir Putin .\n\u201c In the intelligence business , we would say that Mr. Putin had recruited Mr. Trump as an unwitting agent of the Russian Federation , \u201d Mr. Morell said .\nIndeed , many Republicans expressed dismay at Mr. Trump \u2019 s praise of Mr. Putin , who has invaded eastern Ukraine , annexed the Crimean Peninsula and viewed NATO as an existential threat as he tries to destabilize Western democracies .\nThey also cringe at the president \u2019 s habitual Twitter feeds that often veer from policy and toward personal disputes with people in the media , Hollywood and sports .\nStill , the machinations of Mr. Obama \u2019 s national security team seem to be unprecedented against a candidate , president-elect and president .\nThe FBI used the discredited dossier at least once to obtain a warrant to bug former Trump campaign volunteer Carter Page .
