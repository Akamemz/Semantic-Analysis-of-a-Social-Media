    "content": "Facebook workers routinely suppressed news stories of interest to conservative readers from the social network \u2019 s influential \u201c trending \u201d news section , according to a former journalist who worked on the project . This individual says that workers prevented stories about the right-wing CPAC gathering , Mitt Romney , Rand Paul , and other conservative topics from appearing in the highly-influential section , even though they were organically trending among the site \u2019 s users .\nSeveral former Facebook \u201c news curators , \u201d as they were known internally , also told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that they were instructed to artificially \u201c inject \u201d selected stories into the trending news module , even if they weren \u2019 t popular enough to warrant inclusion\u2014or in some cases weren \u2019 t trending at all . The former curators , all of whom worked as contractors , also said they were directed not to include news about Facebook itself in the trending module .\nIn other words , Facebook \u2019 s news section operates like a traditional newsroom , reflecting the biases of its workers and the institutional imperatives of the corporation . Imposing human editorial values onto the lists of topics an algorithm spits out is by no means a bad thing\u2014but it is in stark contrast to the company \u2019 s claims that the trending module simply lists \u201c topics that have recently become popular on Facebook . \u201d\nThese new allegations emerged after \u2588\u2588\u2588 last week revealed details about the inner workings of Facebook \u2019 s trending news team\u2014a small group of young journalists , primarily educated at Ivy League or private East Coast universities , who curate the \u201c trending \u201d module on the upper-right-hand corner of the site . As we reported last week , curators have access to a ranked list of trending topics surfaced by Facebook \u2019 s algorithm , which prioritizes the stories that should be shown to Facebook users in the trending section . The curators write headlines and summaries of each topic , and include links to news sites . The section , which launched in 2014 , constitutes some of the most powerful real estate on the internet and helps dictate what news Facebook \u2019 s users\u2014167 million in the US alone\u2014are reading at any given moment .\n\u201c I believe it had a chilling effect on conservative news . \u201d\n\u201c Depending on who was on shift , things would be blacklisted or trending , \u201d said the former curator . This individual asked to remain anonymous , citing fear of retribution from the company . The former curator is politically conservative , one of a very small handful of curators with such views on the trending team . \u201c I \u2019 d come on shift and I \u2019 d discover that CPAC or Mitt Romney or Glenn Beck or popular conservative topics wouldn \u2019 t be trending because either the curator didn \u2019 t recognize the news topic or it was like they had a bias against Ted Cruz . \u201d\nThe former curator was so troubled by the omissions that they kept a running log of them at the time ; this individual provided the notes to \u2588\u2588\u2588 . Among the deep-sixed or suppressed topics on the list : former IRS official Lois Lerner , who was accused by Republicans of inappropriately scrutinizing conservative groups ; Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker ; popular conservative news aggregator the Drudge Report ; Chris Kyle , the former Navy SEAL who was murdered in 2013 ; and former Fox News contributor Steven Crowder . \u201c I believe it had a chilling effect on conservative news , \u201d the former curator said .\nAnother former curator agreed that the operation had an aversion to right-wing news sources . \u201c It was absolutely bias . We were doing it subjectively . It just depends on who the curator is and what time of day it is , \u201d said the former curator . \u201c Every once in awhile a Red State or conservative news source would have a story . But we would have to go and find the same story from a more neutral outlet that wasn \u2019 t as biased . \u201d\nStories covered by conservative outlets ( like Breitbart , Washington Examiner , and Newsmax ) that were trending enough to be picked up by Facebook \u2019 s algorithm were excluded unless mainstream sites like the New York Times , the BBC , and CNN covered the same stories .\nOther former curators interviewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588 denied consciously suppressing conservative news , and we were unable to determine if left-wing news topics or sources were similarly suppressed . The conservative curator described the omissions as a function of his colleagues \u2019 judgements ; there is no evidence that Facebook management mandated or was even aware of any political bias at work .\nManagers on the trending news team did , however , explicitly instruct curators to artificially manipulate the trending module in a different way : When users weren \u2019 t reading stories that management viewed as important , several former workers said , curators were told to put them in the trending news feed anyway . Several former curators described using something called an \u201c injection tool \u201d to push topics into the trending module that weren \u2019 t organically being shared or discussed enough to warrant inclusion\u2014putting the headlines in front of thousands of readers rather than allowing stories to surface on their own . In some cases , after a topic was injected , it actually became the number one trending news topic on Facebook .\n\u201c We were told that if we saw something , a news story that was on the front page of these ten sites , like CNN , the New York Times , and BBC , then we could inject the topic , \u201d said one former curator . \u201c If it looked like it had enough news sites covering the story , we could inject it\u2014even if it wasn \u2019 t naturally trending. \u201d Sometimes , breaking news would be injected because it wasn \u2019 t attaining critical mass on Facebook quickly enough to be deemed \u201c trending \u201d by the algorithm . Former curators cited the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 and the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris as two instances in which non-trending stories were forced into the module . Facebook has struggled to compete with Twitter when it comes to delivering real-time news to users ; the injection tool may have been designed to artificially correct for that deficiency in the network . \u201c We would get yelled at if it was all over Twitter and not on Facebook , \u201d one former curator said .\n\u201c Facebook got a lot of pressure about not having a trending topic for Black Lives Matter . \u201d\nIn other instances , curators would inject a story\u2014even if it wasn \u2019 t being widely discussed on Facebook\u2014because it was deemed important for making the network look like a place where people talked about hard news . \u201c People stopped caring about Syria , \u201d one former curator said . \u201c [ And ] if it wasn \u2019 t trending on Facebook , it would make Facebook look bad. \u201d That same curator said the Black Lives Matter movement was also injected into Facebook \u2019 s trending news module . \u201c Facebook got a lot of pressure about not having a trending topic for Black Lives Matter , \u201d the individual said . \u201c They realized it was a problem , and they boosted it in the ordering . They gave it preference over other topics . When we injected it , everyone started saying , \u2018 Yeah , now I \u2019 m seeing it as number one \u2019 . \u201d This particular injection is especially noteworthy because the # BlackLivesMatter movement originated on Facebook , and the ensuing media coverage of the movement often noted its powerful social media presence .\n( In February , CEO Mark Zuckerberg expressed his support for the movement in an internal memo chastising Facebook employees for defacing Black Lives Matter slogans on the company \u2019 s internal \u201c signature wall . \u201d )\nWhen stories about Facebook itself would trend organically on the network , news curators used less discretion\u2014they were told not to include these stories at all . \u201c When it was a story about the company , we were told not to touch it , \u201d said one former curator . \u201c It had to be cleared through several channels , even if it was being shared quite a bit . We were told that we should not be putting it on the trending tool . \u201d\n( The curators interviewed for this story worked for Facebook across a timespan ranging from mid-2014 to December 2015 . )\n\u201c We were always cautious about covering Facebook , \u201d said another former curator . \u201c We would always wait to get second level approval before trending something to Facebook . Usually we had the authority to trend anything on our own [ but ] if it was something involving Facebook , the copy editor would call their manager , and that manager might even call their manager before approving a topic involving Facebook . \u201d\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 reached out to Facebook for comment about each of these specific claims via email and phone , but did not receive a response .\nSeveral former curators said that as the trending news algorithm improved , there were fewer instances of stories being injected . They also said that the trending news process was constantly being changed , so there \u2019 s no way to know exactly how the module is run now . But the revelations undermine any presumption of Facebook as a neutral pipeline for news , or the trending news module as an algorithmically-driven list of what people are actually talking about .\nRather , Facebook \u2019 s efforts to play the news game reveal the company to be much like the news outlets it is rapidly driving toward irrelevancy : a select group of professionals with vaguely center-left sensibilities . It just happens to be one that poses as a neutral reflection of the vox populi , has the power to influence what billions of users see , and openly discusses whether it should use that power to influence presidential elections .\n\u201c It wasn \u2019 t trending news at all , \u201d said the former curator who logged conservative news omissions . \u201c It was an opinion . \u201d\n[ Disclosure : Facebook has launched a program that pays publishers , including the New York Times and Buzzfeed , to produce videos for its Facebook Live tool .
