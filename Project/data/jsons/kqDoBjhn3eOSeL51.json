    "content": "President Obama rightly acknowledged on Monday that there is \u201c no excuse \u201d for the horrendously botched opening of the federal Web site consumers are supposed to use to sign up for health insurance policies under the Affordable Care Act . Unless the problems can be fixed soon , they threaten to undermine the ability of the health care exchanges to help enroll some seven million uninsured Americans in 2014 .\nThe administration created the Web site so the buck necessarily stops with high officials \u2014 Kathleen Sebelius , the secretary of health and human services , and President Obama himself \u2014 who allowed this to happen . The administration attributes the problems partly to unexpectedly high demand from people eager to compare insurance policies available in their states and partly to technical glitches that blocked or slowed people from submitting applications and erroneous data being sent to insurers . Why the administration failed to anticipate the high demand has never been explained . Nor has it clearly explained the nature of the technical problems \u2014 or who in government or among the private contractors is primarily responsible for them .\nThe problems with the site have frustrated millions of people trying to get information and coverage . In response , the administration has put forward a two-part approach to coping with Web site failures . It has added information technology experts from inside and outside the government to work 24 hours a day , seven days a week to try to overcome the technical glitches . Second , it has expanded and publicized alternative ways to find out about health plans and costs \u2014 like increased staffing at call centers that will help people enroll by phone at all hours of day and night , counselors ( called navigators ) in each state who will help people enroll in person , and applications that can be downloaded and mailed in .\nMr. Obama also made this important pledge to all consumers who tried to apply through the federal Web site and got stuck somewhere in the process : \u201c In the coming weeks , we will contact you directly , personally \u201d to recommend how to complete the application , shop for coverage and pick a suitable plan .",
