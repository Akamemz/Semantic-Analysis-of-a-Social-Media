When he arrives in the Middle East toward the end of May , he 'll be traveling abroad later in his presidency than any commander in chief since Lyndon B. Johnson , who waited more than 10 months after President John F. Kennedy was killed to travel abroad .\nAfter the Vatican , Trump will make stops in Brussels and Sicily for NATO and G-7 meetings . Those stops were announced earlier this year .\nAccording to Trump 's aides , the trip is designed as a symbolic show of resolve to top US allies , whom the Trump administration hopes will renew their efforts to combat radicalism and intolerance around the world .\nBut people familiar with the trip 's planning said it 's also meant to demonstrate a new era of American foreign policy in high-octane fashion . Revealing the trip during a Rose Garden ceremony Thursday for the National Day of Prayer , Trump deemed it a `` major and historic announcement . ''\n`` Someone clearly saw the Vatican , Israel and Saudi Arabia as a broad stage where the President could demonstrate a certain degree of unity and ecumenism and go to places where he could be guaranteed a high degree of symbolism when it came to his first presidential trip , '' said Aaron David Miller , a senior fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars .\n`` The trip provides a dramatic stage on which to act out his presidential role , '' Miller added .\nThe first stop in Saudi Arabia was designed specifically to rebut perceptions that Trump is anti-Muslim , according to a person who helped plan the stop .\nThe Islamic world has been rattled by some of Trump 's actions , including signing an executive order barring entry to citizens of certain Muslim-majority nations and vowing during the campaign to end all Muslim immigration into the US .\n`` We thought that was very important because obviously people have tried to portray the President in a certain way , '' said a senior administration official . `` But I think that what he wants to do is solve the same problem that a lot of the leaders in the Islamic world want to do . ''\nSpeaking Thursday , Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said he believed the trip will help rebut impressions that Trump is anti-Islam .\n`` It 's a clear and powerful message that the US harbors no ill will toward the Arab and Muslim world , '' he said . `` It also lays to rest the notion that America is anti-Muslim . ''\nTrump 's stops in Riyadh , Jerusalem , Rome , Brussels and Sicily are not set to be long -- in some cases , he expects to spend only a night , according to officials who are planning the trip .

Saudi Arabia , along with other Arab Gulf nations , then felt neglected when Obama brokered a deal with Iran over its nuclear weapons , leading to fears the US was realigning its interests in the region .\n`` All the conversations we 've had with all the leaders around the world show that there is a lot of frustration with how things have been done to date , and I think he 's driven by common sense , and he 's driven by a real practical approach to try to get things done , '' said a senior administration official .\nPresident Barack Obama 's first stop abroad was in Canada , and every US president since Jimmy Carter has made that or Mexico his inaugural foreign destination .
