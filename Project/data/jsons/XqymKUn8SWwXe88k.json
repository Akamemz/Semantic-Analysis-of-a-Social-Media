Only two lawmakers who served in Iraq or Afghanistan , for example , support US military action there . The other 14 , who include a mixture of Democrats and Republicans , either remain skeptical or oppose action altogether .\n\u201c Anytime someone has been in combat and has been on the ground and knows the net result of these decisions , it definitely gives you a perspective that influences you , \u201d says Mr. Tarantino , a former Army captain who served as a platoon leader in Baghdad . \u201c For veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan , we have a very visceral and very recent perspective on combat . We know more than anyone what it \u2019 s going to look like . \u201d\nRep. Tammy Duckworth ( D ) of Illinois , who lost both of her legs when the Black Hawk helicopter she was piloting was hit with a rocket-propelled grenade , is a freshman lawmaker and a combat veteran who remains skeptical of US intervention in Syria .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve heard discussion before that this type of thing is going to be a limited attack and it will be done in a short amount of time , \u201d she told reporters in September . \u201c War is messy . War is never that simple . \u201d\nVeterans often bring a similar skepticism to questions about Pentagon spending . That \u2019 s often because veterans \u201c can actually stand up and talk about defense spending in a way that will be realistic without being attacked for lack of patriotism or not being strong on defense , \u201d Ms. Duckworth told the Associated Press last year .\nDuring the 30 years he served as an officer in the US Marines , Greg Raths flew fighter jets . Now he is running as a Republican for a seat in Congress representing southern California \u2019 s 45th District .\nThis experience gives him a clear perspective on Pentagon weapons systems like the F-35 fighter jet , he says , which has been plagued with billions of dollars in cost overruns .\n\u201c It \u2019 s the military industrial machine running this whole thing , but this plane is not performing , \u201d Mr. Raths says . \u201c I \u2019 d be more open to cutting some of these programs than pouring more money into them . \u201d\nRaths is part of the next wave of veterans running for Congress in 2014 . This already-forming group also includes Kirk Jorgensen , a US Marine who deployed to Iraq and elsewhere six times during his 10 years of service and is now running in California \u2019 s 52nd District .\nMr. Jorgensen recalls filling sandbags and putting them on the floors of Humvees before they were properly armored , in an effort to deflect the blasts of roadside bombs . His unit put them on the hoods of their vehicles , too , \u201c so the hood wouldn \u2019 t fly up and crush you . \u201d\nHaving dealt with such shortages in equipment during wartime , he is frustrated with the propensity of Congress to fund expensive weapons systems that the military expressly does not want .\n\u201c We \u2019 re building tanks the Army hasn \u2019 t asked for , and transporting them to the desert , so that members of Congress can get themselves reelected and provide the jobs for their districts , \u201d Jorgensen says .\n\u201c This frustrates men and women in the military . In some cases , we didn \u2019 t even have the proper flak jackets . \u201d\nJorgensen has signed a three-term limit pledge . The point , he says , is to be less beholden to corporate interests that often keep politicians in office , and more responsive to the citizens being represented .\nIf it all sounds a bit idealistic , Jorgensen says he recognizes the challenges of running for office as a veteran . Often , he notes , because vets deploy and move often , \u201c military men and women don \u2019 t establish the roots necessary to build a constituency . \u201d\nThere \u2019 s a perception , too , that \u201c vets show up with big hearts , great ideas , but not a lot of \u2018 oomph \u2019 when it comes to money-raising . \u201d\nBut the issues America faces now are too important not to try to get more vets in office , Jorgensen says .\nThis includes fighting a war on terror that he sees as eroding US constitutional rights .\nAs a US Marine , Jorgensen was tapped to go to the Central Intelligence Agency \u2019 s \u201c farm \u201d to train to be a case officer . He was then assigned to capture \u201c people indicted for war crimes , \u201d or PIFWCs .\nHe briefed Madeleine Albright , then secretary of State , and other top leaders about an organization called \u201c the base , \u201d later known as Al Qaeda .\nEven though he understands the threats posed by terrorists clearly , he says he was \u201c horrified \u201d when he learned that America was using drones to target US citizens in the war on terror .\n\u201c A US person is a US person , and at some point we need to draw a line about when we deploy weapons on US persons , \u201d he says .\nIt is a \u201c red line \u201d that America has crossed , he warns , and it requires more congressional oversight .\n\u201c The US Constitution needs to come into play . If we have the capability to use UAVs to take out vehicles in Yemen \u2013 if we \u2019 re willing to do that , why can \u2019 t we drop a team and put [ a US citizen ] in flexicuffs and drag them away ? \u201d he adds , noting that this is what he did when he was assigned to capture PIFWCs , often in the middle of the night .\n\u201c And who is it that decides which US citizens get rolled up and who gets killed ? \u201d\nIn addition to questioning American policies with which they are intimately familiar , veterans say they hope they can begin to change attitudes in a bitterly divided Congress .\n\u201c You can educate your peers : You can do it over coffee , you can do it by storytelling , \u201d Jorgensen says . \u201c You tell them the way you feel and the way you \u2019 re going to vote . You don \u2019 t do it in eight-second sound bites that get people all riled up . You have legitimate conversations rather than constant debate . \u201d\nSometimes , they can begin conversations that Congress simply was not having before , says Anu Bhagwati , a former Marine Corps captain and now executive director of the Service Women \u2019 s Action Network ( SWAN ) , an advocacy organization .\nThe fact that female combat veterans , for example , are now serving in Congress \u201c is to me the really historic story , \u201d she says .\nShe cites Rep.
