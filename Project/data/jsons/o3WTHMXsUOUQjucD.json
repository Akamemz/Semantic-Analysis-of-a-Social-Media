    "content": "Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire , in tense testimony Thursday on Capitol Hill , defended his handling of the explosive whistleblower complaint alleging President Trump pressured the Ukrainian president to investigate the Biden family -- while calling the matter `` unprecedented . ''\nBut after maintaining his composure for most of the morning , his frustration showed through at the end , when House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff , D-Calif. , repeatedly pressed him to agree that the matter should be investigated .\nMaguire stressed that the committee now has all of the relevant information , including the whistleblower complaint itself that was released publicly Thursday morning , and said it 's up to them to decide how to proceed .\n\u201c The horse has left the barn , \u201d Maguire said . \u201c You have all of the information . You have the whistleblower complaint . You have the letter from the ICIG . You have the Office of Legal Counsel opinion and you have the transcript from the president . \u201d\nMaguire also stressed that the complaint was essentially `` hearsay '' and not \u201c corroborated by other folks . \u201d\n\u201c This is second-hand information . I am not criticizing the whistleblower , \u201d Maguire said . \u201c ... I am in no position to tell the committee to do an investigation or not to do an investigation . \u201d\nSchiff vowed at the end `` we are gon na find out '' the backstory , including whether U.S. aid was tied in any way to Trump 's investigation request , which the president denies .\nThe combative conclusion of the session reflected the high tensions and enormous stakes surrounding Maguire 's appearance . The rare open hearing of the intelligence committee commanded Washington 's political attention given the implications for the newly launched impeachment inquiry against Trump , related to the whistleblower complaint .\nShortly after the hearing ended , Trump fired back on Twitter , saying : \u201c Adam Schiff has zero credibility . Another fantasy to hurt the Republican Party ! \u201d\nHe told reporters that the process is a \u201c disgrace , \u201d defended his Ukraine call as \u201c absolutely perfect \u201d and accused Democrats of bringing any legislative progress to a standstill .\nMaguire 's reputation was also on trial Thursday . He has come under fire from Democrats for initially withholding a copy of the complaint from lawmakers . That standoff was technically resolved when the complaint was declassified , and released to the public , in advance of the hearing . But Maguire was still pressed for answers from Democratic committee members on why his office did not hand over the complaint at first .\nMaguire insisted he is `` not partisan '' and `` not political , '' reminding the panel that he served under eight presidents and has taken the oath of office 11 times .\n`` I have served and led through turbulent times , '' he said . `` ... My integrity has never been questioned until now . ''\nHowever , he maintained , `` I believe that I handled this matter in full compliance with the law at all times . \u201d\nAt one point in the hearing , during a tense exchange with Rep. Eric Swalwell , D-Calif. , about allegations in the complaint of a potential \u201c cover-up \u201d regarding the Ukraine call , Maguire pushed back again by reminding the committee that the complaint was not based on direct knowledge .\n\u201c This is second-hand information from a whistleblower . I have no knowledge if that is a true and accurate statement , \u201d Maguire said regarding the \u201c cover-up \u201d claim . The complaint said White House officials tried to \u201c lock down \u201d records of the call . In the same document , the whistleblower also acknowledged not being a \u201c direct witness \u201d to most of the events described , instead citing other U.S. officials who are not named .\nRepublican members also jumped to Maguire 's defense at the hearing , while accusing Democrats of launching an `` information warfare operation '' against Trump . Rep. Chris Stewart , R-Utah , said of Maguire : `` I think you 're nuts if you 're going to convince the American people that your cause is just by attacking this man , by impugning his character . ''\nSchiff , meanwhile , questioned Maguire over the timeline of his cooperation with the committee . Maguire said he was not able to release the document at first because of executive privilege concerns and other issues . He also said he is not aware of any instance where such a complaint dealt with such `` complicated and sensitive issues . ''\n`` I believe that this matter is unprecedented , '' he testified . He also said he does not know the identity of the whistleblower , but said he or she acted in `` good faith . ''\nMaguire maintained that he was `` not stonewalling '' despite the delay in the release of the complaint to the committee , but following `` the law the way it was written , not the law as people might wish it to be . '' Maguire again explained that he was required to review the complaint for executive privilege .\n`` It took longer than I would have liked , '' he said . `` But once the transcripts were released , no longer was there an issue of executive privilege ... so then I was able to release the information to you . ''\nHe added : `` At no time did I ever try to withhold information . ''\nThe complaint cites \u201c multiple White House officials with direct knowledge of the call '' between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky , and accuses Trump of attempting \u201c to pressure the Ukranian leader to take actions to help the President \u2019 s 2020 reelection bid. \u201d It also presents allegations that the White House tried to `` restrict access '' to records of the call .\nThe complaint goes on to allege that White House officials said they were `` directed '' by White House attorneys to remove the transcript of the call from the computer system where they are normally kept . Instead , the transcript was allegedly kept on a different system normally used for classified information .\nWHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINT HAS BEEN DECLASSIFIED AND CONTAINS NO 'SURPRISES , ' GOP LAWMAKER SAYS\nMeanwhile , Republicans on the committee , including Ranking Member Devin Nunes , R-Calif. , accused Democrats of orchestrating a public spectacle .\n`` I want to congratulate the Democrats on the rollout of their latest information warfare operation against the president , and their extraordinary ability once again to enlist the mainstream media in their campaign , '' Nunes said , adding that \u201c we \u2019 ve been treated to an unending parade of press releases , press conferences , and fake news stories . \u201d\n`` The released transcript of the call has already debunked that central assertion , but that did n't matter , '' he continued . `` The Democrats simply moved the goalposts and began claiming that there does n't need to be a quid pro quo for this conversation to serve as the basis for impeaching the president . ''\nThe White House , on Wednesday , released an unclassified version of the transcript of that controversial phone call . The memo , which does not reflect a \u201c verbatim transcript \u201d but is based on \u201c notes and recollections \u201d of those memorializing the call , shows Trump congratulating Zelensky on his election victory before Trump eventually gets to the subject of the Bidens , seeking an investigation of some kind .\nMaguire says that the whistleblower complaint released Thursday `` is in alignment with what was released yesterday by the president . ''\nTrump first asked Zelensky to do a `` favor '' and \u201c find out what happened \u201d with the hacking of the DNC server in 2016 . He referenced CrowdStrike , a cyber firm used by the DNC to investigate the attacks .\nThen , Trump went on to seek assistance in investigating the Bidens .\n\u201c The other thing , there \u2019 s a lot of talk about Biden \u2019 s son , that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great , \u201d Trump said . \u201c Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it\u2026It sounds horrible to me . \u201d\nThis refers to Joe Biden , while vice president , urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor , Viktor Shokin , who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings \u2014 where Hunter Biden was on the board . Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention .\nWhile the transcript shows Trump pressing Ukraine to \u201c look into \u201d the Bidens , it does not show the U.S. president explicitly linking that request to U.S. aid \u2014 which had been frozen days earlier , a detail that fueled impeachment calls earlier this week and helped prompt House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday .\nHours after the transcript was released , Trump met with Zelensky on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York City . Reporters asked Zelensky about the call with Trump , and whether he felt pressured by the U.S. president , as alleged by the whistleblower\u2014an accusation he denied .\n\u201c I think you read everything . I \u2019 m sorry but I don \u2019 t want to be involved in democratic elections of the USA , \u201d he said . \u201c We had a good phone call . It was normal , we spoke about many things . \u201d\nHe added : \u201c I think you read it that nobody pushed me . \u201d\nRepublicans have also raised concerns about the whistleblower 's possible `` political bias , '' as the intelligence community inspector general found indications the whistleblower was `` in favor of a rival political candidate '' of Trump .",
