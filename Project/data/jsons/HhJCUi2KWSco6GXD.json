    "content": "The new poll , conducted for the Democratic group Focus on Rural America by party pollster David Binder , found Buttigieg leading the field with 19 percent of the vote . Sanders trailed with 17 percent of the vote , a statistically insignificant disadvantage .\nBoth gained 3 points since the last Focus on Rural America poll , conducted in early January .\nWarren is the top second choice among voters , taking 20 percent and suggesting she may have the strongest upside potential . Seventeen percent each said Biden and Klobuchar were their second choices , and 13 percent said Sanders would be number two on their list if their chosen candidate is not viable . Buttigieg clocked in fifth , at 10 percent .\nThe race remains in flux even hours before Iowans head to the caucuses . Only 51 percent of Iowa voters said they were completely certain to stick with their chosen candidates .\n\u201c If anyone tells you they know what \u2019 s going to happen tonight , they \u2019 re making it up , \u201d said Jeff Link , the co-founder of the rural group .\nButtigieg , who has stumped at a frenetic pace across Iowa in recent months , has the highest favorable rating among state Democratic voters . Sixty-nine percent said they see him favorably , just above the 68 percent who said the same about Warren . More than 6 in 10 Iowa Democrats see Biden ( 62 percent ) , Klobuchar ( 63 percent ) and Sanders ( 64 percent ) favorably .\nThe least-favorably viewed Democratic presidential candidate , the poll found , is the one who is not competing for Iowa \u2019 s votes . Just 30 percent of Iowa Democrats said they had a favorable impression of former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg , who has poured millions into television ads in every state except Iowa . Fifty percent said they see Bloomberg unfavorably .\nThe poll , conducted Jan. 28-30 , surveyed 300 likely caucusgoers and reports a margin of error of plus or minus 5.7 percentage points . That high margin means all four of the top contenders have a realistic shot at winning the caucuses .\nThe high number of undecided and potentially persuadable voters , coupled with the realignment allowed after a first round of voting , means the actual winner is likely to finish with somewhere north of 30 percent of the delegate vote , Link said .",
