Kerry said Tuesday that members of Congress who refused to authorize retaliatory strikes against Syria would be responsible when the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad gasses its citizens or when North Korea or Iran attempts to use nuclear weapons .\nOpening the administration \u2019 s official pitch to Congress for action , Mr. Kerry testified at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing that he didn \u2019 t want to rule out the need for the U.S. to deploy troops to the ground in Syria \u2014 then backtracked and said if it means winning a vote , they have \u201c no problem \u201d with Congress writing a resolution prohibiting troops .\nLate Tuesday , the top members of the committee said they had agreed on the text of a resolution that would prohibit \u201c combat \u201d troops from being deployed to Syria and would give the president just 90 days to conduct his strikes .\nThat resolution will be put to a committee vote Wednesday . The administration hopes it begins to build momentum for eventual approval by both chambers of Congress .\nThe White House picked up an important ally in House Speaker John A. Boehner , Ohio Republican , who emerged from a meeting with President Obama to say he will vote to authorize an attack on Syria .\nWhether Mr. Boehner brings any support with him , though , is questionable .

Bob Corker , the key Republican in the negotiations , hours after Mr. Kerry and the top two Defense Department officials \u2014 Secretary Chuck Hagel and Gen. Martin E.
