Of course , even the proponents of these laws admitted there were no instances of Muslims trying to impose Islamic law . But hey , why let facts get in the way of good ole demonization of a minority group for political gain ? !\nSo it may come as a shock to some\u2014and really freak out others on the right\u2014to discover that in various places across the United States , politicians are actually courting support from the Muslim community in terms of both votes and money . And the kicker is\u2014some of the candidates are even Republicans .\nThis is actually not a surprise to me . Over the past few years I have witnessed a change in the way elected officials have approached the Muslim community . A few years ago , Muslim organizations were lucky to have a representative from the local mayor \u2019 s office attend a dinner . Now these events are attended by not just the mayor , but also numerous elected officials including members of Congress .\nAnd now the Muslim community is actually seeing politicians actively pursue their support in places where there \u2019 s a sizable Muslim population . For example , in Michigan , the Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mark Schauer , who is in a tight race against GOP Governor Rick Snyder , will be holding a campaign event Thursday at the Arab American National Museum in Dearborn . ( Just so it \u2019 s clear , Arab and Muslim don \u2019 t mean the same thing . Muslim refers to religion while Arab is an ethnicity and in fact more than 60 percent of Arab Americans are Christians . But there is an overlap on many key issues of concern . )\nJim Zogby , the president of the Arab American Institute , shared with me the evolution of the way Arabs and Muslims have been treated by politicians in Michigan . In 1985 , the mayor of Dearborn distributed fliers about the growing \u201c Arab problem. \u201d Then , there were only about 750 Arab American registered to vote .\nFlash forward to 2014 . Now there are more than 14,000 registered Arab and Muslim American voters . Consequently , politicians actively seek the community \u2019 s support , and the newly elected president of the Dearborn City Council , Susan Dabaja , is Arab American .\nWe are seeing a similar development in Brooklyn , New York , home to more than 35,000 Arabs and Muslims . As Linda Sarsour , President of the Muslim Democratic Club of Brooklyn explained , during the 2013 Democratic mayoral primary contest , every major Democratic candidate appeared at their candidates ' night .\nSarsour noted that Republicans have also attended the Brooklyn Muslim community \u2019 s events .

There , the GOP 's U.S. Senate candidate Ed Gillespie tweeted out a photo in July at a Muslim event wishing the Muslim community a happy Eid .\nAnd in contrast to Oklahoma , where Bennett \u2019 s hateful comments about Muslims were actually backed up the state GOP chair , when a Virginia state Republican official made anti-Muslim remarks in August , he resigned after being pressured by fellow Republicans .\nBut it \u2019 s not population growth alone .
