Obama described its members as \u201c seasoned al Qaeda operatives in Syria . \u201d\nU.S. officials said the group was plotting attacks against the United States and other Western targets .\n`` Once again , it must be clear to anyone who would plot against America and try to do Americans harm that we will not tolerate safe havens for terrorists who threaten our people , '' Obama said .\nThere is bipartisan support in Congress for the U.S. military actions , Obama said , adding that `` America is always stronger when we stand united . And that unity sends a powerful message to the world that we will do what 's necessary to defend our country .\nThe strikes were `` very successful , '' Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said Tuesday .\nWhile the military ca n't comment in detail about future plans , the strikes `` were only the beginning , '' Kirby added .\nThe strikes came in three waves , with coalition partners participating in the latter two , Army Lt. Gen. William Mayville Jr. said Tuesday . The first wave , which mostly targeted the Khorasan Group , started at 5:30 a.m. ( 8:30 p.m . ET Monday ) and involved U.S. ships firing missiles into eastern and northern Syria .\nThe second wave , 30 minutes later , involved planes striking northern Syria , with targets including ISIS headquarters , training camps and combat vehicles . The third wave , begun shortly after 7 a.m. , involved planes targeting ISIS training camps and combat vehicles in eastern Syria , Mayville said .\nIt 's too early to say what effect the U.S. strikes had against the Khorasan Group , Mayville said .\nThe strikes marked the first time the United States used F-22 Raptor stealth aircraft in a combat role . The military has previously run into problems with the aircraft .\nThe airstrikes against ISIS focused on the city of Raqqa , the declared capital of ISIS ' self-proclaimed Islamic State . But other areas were hit as well .\nThe operation began with a flurry of Tomahawk missiles launched from the sea , followed by attacks from bomber and fighter aircraft , a senior U.S. military official told CNN .\nThe goal : Taking out ISIS ' ability to command , train and resupply its militants .\nIn all , 200 pieces of ordnance were dropped by coalition members , and four dozen aircraft were used , a U.S. official told CNN . About 150 weapons used were precision-guided munitions . The United States fired 47 Tomahawk missiles , eight of them against Khorasan targets .\nThe number of casualties was not immediately clear . But U.S. Central Command said the strikes damaged or destroyed ISIS targets including fighters , training compounds , command-and-control facilities , a finance center and supply trucks .\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 70 ISIS militants were killed and more than 300 were wounded . But CNN and other news outlets were unable to confirm the figures .\nCNN national security analyst Fran Townsend said these attacks focused on infrastructure , but were just the beginning .\nEventually , she said , there will likely be `` a real campaign to go after leadership targets . ''\nFor months , civilians in Raqqa have been living under the harsh rule of ISIS after militants took over their city , which had been one of Syria 's most liberal cities . The group now controls much of their lives , imposing a strict brand of Sharia law and doling out barbaric punishments , such as beheadings and crucifixions .\nAbo Ismail , an opposition activist inside Raqqa , said Tuesday that residents were elated to see the U.S. attacking ISIS targets there .\nBut at the same time , he said , ISIS has increased security in the city .\n`` I would dance in the streets , but I am too afraid , '' Ismail said .\nA U.S. intelligence official said that while law enforcement is aware the airstrikes against ISIS in Syria could incite a response , there is no evidence to suggest any terrorist strike is in the works against the United States .\nThe involvement of several Mideast nations is `` a remarkable diplomatic achievement , '' said CNN political commentator Peter Beinart . `` I do n't think it was expected that there would be this much Arab support .
