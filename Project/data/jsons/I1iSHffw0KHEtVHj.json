    "content": "Black merchants affected by the war on drugs are denied licenses and thrown into debt as white owners thrive\nA Los Angeles government program set up to provide cannabis licenses to people harmed by the war on drugs has been plagued by delays , scandal and bureaucratic blunders , costing some intended beneficiaries hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses .\nBlack entrepreneurs and activists across LA told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the city \u2019 s embattled \u201c social equity \u201d program has left aspiring business owners on an indefinite waiting list , causing potentially irreparable damage to their families \u2019 finances and preventing them from opening marijuana shops they have been planning for years .\nFewer than 20 of the 100 businesses on track to receive a license through the program appear to be black-owned , according to estimates from advocates , who say the community most disproportionately targeted by marijuana arrests is again facing discrimination . And even some of those applicants now face precarious futures .\nMeanwhile , the existing LA industry is thriving \u2013 with many white business owners at the helm .\n\u201c How do you get to come and make millions of dollars off of our misery ? \u201d said Lanaisha Edwards , a south LA native who had applied for a cannabis license through the program . \u201c The war on drugs destroyed so many families . We should at least get to come out on the other end and create some wealth out of it . But it \u2019 s not gon na happen the way this is going . \u201d\nFormally launched in 2018 , LA \u2019 s social equity program received national attention and praise from activists as a potential model for the rest of the nation as more states move to legalize cannabis .\nThe city aimed to right some of the wrongs of criminalization by giving new retail licenses to people from communities historically harmed by marijuana laws , and by eliminating some of the traditional barriers in opening small businesses . Residents would be eligible if they were low-income and had cannabis arrests or convictions on their records , or lived in LA neighborhoods that were disproportionately targeted by the policing of pot .\n\u201c This was supposed to be our reparations , \u201d said Rabin Woods , 57 , who was arrested in 1983 for a marijuana offense and is now struggling to open a dispensary in LA .\nLA law enforcement has a long history of profiling black and Latino residents , with data consistently showing disproportionate impacts in stops and searches , arrests and prison time . Under cannabis criminalization , black Americans were four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana than white people ( and in some years , seven times more likely in LA ) .\nAfter California became the first state to adopt medicinal marijuana in 1996 , the loosely regulated medical sector that expanded in LA and other cities largely excluded communities of color .\nOut of nearly 200 cannabis retailers previously approved by the city of LA to do medical dispensaries , only six are black-owned , according to Virgil Grant , one of the six owners and a co-founder of the California Minority Alliance , which advocates inclusion . Even fewer are Latino-owned , he said .\nResidents in LA were hopeful that the social equity process , launched after the state voted to legalize recreational pot , would start to close the glaring racial gaps . But targets of the program said the process quickly became a disaster .\nLA \u2019 s newly formed department of cannabis regulation ( DCR ) first gave out licenses to businesses that were already running medical dispensaries and were considered grandfathered in under new laws . In a second round , the city doled out manufacturing and cultivation licenses for the people who wanted to legally grow cannabis .\nThe third phase was most critical and competitive : licensing new storefronts .\nThe city developed a \u201c first-come , first-served \u201d system for shops , and said it would give out 100 licenses to eligible social equity candidates . More than 1,800 people submitted initial applications .\nWhen the application process officially launched on 3 September 2019 , it was a high-stakes competition of who could send their online applications quickest .\n\u201c It went from social equity to who has the fastest internet , \u201d said Brandon Brinson , who applied to open a dispensary . \u201c It was like a rat race , \u201d added Evelyn , his wife and business partner .\nIn December , the city admitted there were problems with the system . More than a dozen applicants had somehow received early access to the online portal . The city claimed it was a technical error that it remedied and that the mistake did not ultimately affect its consideration of applicants .\nBut activists and entrepreneurs cried foul , arguing it seemed the city had given some people an unfair advantage , and that the process was potentially corrupt .\nThe mayor ordered an \u201c audit \u201d of the program , and all licensing is now on hold .\nIn addition , many candidates who did make the top 100 list do not appear to be representative of the victims of LA \u2019 s war on drugs . The eligibility requirements were not specific to race , and activists said the geographical boundaries of the impacted neighborhoods were too broad , ultimately allowing a wide range of applicants who were not directly affected by marijuana arrests .\nA DCR spokesperson said the agency does not collect demographic information on business owners and is legally barred from using race as a factor in the application process .\nActivists estimated that only 18 of the people who made the top 100 list were African American . Some of them are still facing obstacles to launching .\nFacing the fallout : \u2018 How could LA get this so wrong ? \u2019\nIn order to be eligible , the city required that applicants already possessed appropriate retail spaces , which meant many last year raced to start renting storefronts and securing investors . They are now faced with uncertain timelines and no guarantee of licenses .\nKika Keith , a leading activist for social equity applicants , who has also been trying to open her own cannabis business , has been renting a storefront in south LA for more than a year , waiting for the process to be finalized .\nA single mother of three who grew up in the area where she \u2019 s renting her store , Keith is exactly the kind of candidate the program was supposed to support . Her family was torn apart by criminalization , with her stepfather sentenced to five years for selling a small amount of weed : \u201c It changed our whole lives . The psychological impact of losing him \u2026 our whole family was disrupted . I \u2019 ve seen the damage . \u201d\nKeith planned to sell healthy infused cannabis beverages and support a youth program in the process : \u201c My whole purpose was to reinvest in the community . \u201d\nShe secured the 143rd spot on the city \u2019 s list , but with the uncertainty of the process and ongoing audit , her investors recently pulled out . Running out of time and money , she \u2019 s now questioning whether to give up her space . \u201c I \u2019 m starting back at point A and there \u2019 s no end in sight . \u201d\nLanaisha Edwards , who was arrested for smoking pot as a teenager and had relatives spend years behind bars for marijuana offenses , had plans and a location for a Beverly Grove dispensary . It would secure financial stability for her family and emphasize healing by offering jobs for people targeted by criminalization , she said : \u201c For my children , it would be a chance at generational wealth \u2026 and I \u2019 d be able to give some youth employment and show that people who look like them can go into business . \u201d\nAt first , things look promising for Edwards , who has worked in gang intervention . She was 38th on the city \u2019 s list , had already rented a location , and had the backing of an investor . But Edwards said after months of back and forth , the DCR told her she was not eligible , because her store would be located within 700ft of an \u201c existing dispensary \u201d , violating city rules . She said the city had vetted her application , and that she had used DCR \u2019 s own cannabis webpage to confirm there were no dispensaries near her space .\nAfter researching state records , she says she discovered that DCR appeared to be allowing a marijuana shop to move in down the street from her rental because it previously had a location elsewhere in LA . The company behind it also seemed to be primarily based in Oregon . Edwards had no choice but to give up her rental after more than a year of planning .\n\u201c You jump through all of the hoops \u2026 and it \u2019 s taken away from you , \u201d she said , adding that it would be hard for would-be entrepreneurs to trust the city as the industry continued to leave people behind . \u201c How the hell is the face of cannabis white now , how could that even be possible when you see who did all the time in jail ? \u2026 How could LA get this so wrong ? \u201d\nEvelyn and Brandon Brinson , both 33 , downsized their home and sold a car to finance their planned marijuana business . Evelyn also sold an insurance agency she had run , and Brandon who is a barber , stopped paying rent for space at a shop . \u201c Our whole life savings are in this project , \u201d said Evelyn .\nOn a recent afternoon , the couple showed \u2588\u2588\u2588 around the still vacant store they had rent to house their dispensary . They pointed to empty glass shelves and the display counters that would feature their products . They estimate they have lost more than $ 200,000 on the endeavor .\nTheir application is number 200 on the list , and they don \u2019 t think they can hold on much longer .\n\u201c Why call it social equity and make people think that you \u2019 re helping the black and brown communities ? \u201d Evelyn said . \u201c It \u2019 s stressful seeing everything that you \u2019 ve worked for in your entire life being placed in something that you thought was going to be an opportunity to help you and it has literally hurt you . \u201d\nDCR did not respond to inquiries about the individual cases , and said it would not talk about the license process while the city \u2019 s audit was pending .\nCat Packer , the head of the agency and a former progressive activist , acknowledged the backlash in a recent in-depth interview with the LA Times , saying she could have done a better job managing people \u2019 s expectations . She added she was still dedicated to making social equity a reality .
