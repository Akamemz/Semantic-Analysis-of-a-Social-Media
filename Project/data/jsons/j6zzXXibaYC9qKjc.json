The court 's conservative justices , who are in a majority , appeared somewhat skeptical of the arguments of the lawyers for the LGBTQ workers .\nJustice Samuel Alito , another of the court 's conservatives , said if the court decided to update the statute , it might as well `` just be a legislature . ''\nJustice Elena Kagan , one of the court 's liberal justices , said , however , that employers can not treat a man who loves other men differently than a woman who loves men .\nAt the front of these cases is Gerald Bostock , who , for 10 years , was the child-welfare coordinator for Clayton County , Ga. His primary responsibility was a program that provides advocates in court for abused and neglected children .\n`` It was the job I loved , and my employer loved me doing the job , '' says Bostock , noting that under his leadership , the child advocates program `` reached the benchmark of serving 100 % of the children in foster care , '' an `` unheard of milestone '' for any such program in the greater metro Atlanta region .\nBut in 2013 , Bostock joined a gay recreational softball league . And `` from that point on , my life changed , `` he says . `` Within months , I was fired for being gay . I lost my livelihood . I lost my medical insurance and at the time I was fighting prostate cancer . It was devastating .

She worked for the Harris Funeral Home in Livonia , Mich. , as a funeral director for six years , presenting as a man . But by 2012 , at age 51 , she was in despair over her gender identity and contemplating suicide .\n`` I stood in the backyard for an hour with a gun to my chest , but I could n't do it , '' she says .\nStephens decided she would come out at work as a transgender woman . For eight months , she worked on a letter to her boss and co-workers telling them of her gender identity .\n`` I have realized that some of you may have trouble understanding this , '' she wrote , adding , `` In truth , I have had to live with it every day of my life , and even I do not fully understand it myself .

''\nNeither Clayton County officials nor their lawyers would comment about Bostock 's firing .\nBut in their briefs , the lawyers in both cases argue that Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act does not apply to sexual orientation or gender status at all . `` Everyone understood in 1964 [ when the Civil Rights Act passed ] that sex meant biological sex , '' says John Bursch who argued on behalf of Harris Funeral Homes in the Supreme Court .
