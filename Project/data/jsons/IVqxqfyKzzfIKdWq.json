In 2008 and 2012 , the RNC spent tens of millions of dollars on so-called independent expenditures \u2014 principally TV ads , but also direct mail and phone banks \u2014 supporting its nominees or attacking their Democratic rivals .\nThe lack of air cover has prompted grumbling from Trump aides and allies , many of whom believe that the RNC was never fully supportive of their candidate and that it \u2019 s now turning its back completely on the anti-establishment nominee as his poll numbers crater .\n\u201c The Democrats have an unprecedented and lopsided advertising advantage in this race like we have never seen before , and it is having a serious and negative effect , \u201d said Curt Anderson , a former RNC political director who is helping a pro-Trump super PAC , Rebuilding America Now . \u201c It is possible that Trump has sealed his fate at this point , but it is still a terrible mistake not to have $ 50 million of advertising from the Republican Party exposing Hillary Clinton and keeping her numbers down , \u201d said Anderson , who helped to lead the RNC \u2019 s independent expenditure effort in 2004 and 2008 .\nIn 2004 , the committee spent $ 18.2 million on independent expenditures \u2014 or IEs , in campaign parlance \u2014 boosting George W. Bush \u2019 s reelection bid . In 2008 , the RNC \u2019 s IE spending surged to $ 53.5 million in support of John McCain \u2019 s campaign against Barack Obama . And in 2012 , the RNC spent $ 42.4 million on IEs boosting Mitt Romney or opposing President Obama \u2014 with nearly 80 percent of the spending occurring before mid-October .\nBy contrast , this cycle the RNC has spent only $ 321,000 on independent expenditures attacking Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton . And all of that spending occurred last fall \u2014 before Trump had emerged as the leader for the GOP presidential nomination .\nRNC chief of staff Katie Walsh said the committee is not going to spend any more money this cycle on television ad IEs , but that the decision is completely unrelated to Trump .\nRather , she said , it stems from a strategic calculation made soon after the 2012 election that \u201c that is not an efficient use of party committee dollars to spend money on television. \u201d Pointing to a report that assessed the shortcomings of Republican efforts in the 2012 election , she said RNC leaders determined that the party \u2019 s money was better invested in data-driven voter contact operations .\n\u201c We put people on the ground for three years , invested in communities , doing data and voter registration , so that when we had a nominee , we would be able to link up with that nominee and work together to iinsure that the nominee had the best field program that the Republican nominee has ever had , \u201d said Walsh .\nCampaigns and super PACs are both better suited to funding ads , she argued .\nThat \u2019 s because campaigns \u2014 unlike party committees \u2014 are legally entitled to lower advertising rates than outside groups . Additionally , campaigns are better positioned to make ads that reinforce their candidates \u2019 message since party committees and super PACs are barred from coordinating their advertising strategies with the campaigns they \u2019 re trying to help .\n\u201c Why would we do an IE when we get a worse rate and worse placement than the campaign and the campaign has no idea what the messaging is going to be ? \u201d Walsh said .\nGiven the inefficiencies inherent in independent spending , she contended that it \u2019 s better done by super PACs , which \u2014 unlike party committees such as the RNC \u2014 can accept unlimited contributions from rich benefactors .\n\u201c A super PAC can start up tomorrow and raise $ 100 million immediately and put it on TV , \u201d she said . \u201c It \u2019 s much easier to place a last-minute TV buy than it is to go back and do three years worth of voter contact . \u201d\nThat division of labor has worked well on the Democratic side .\nDespite the Democratic National Committee \u2019 s lack of any IE spending , Clinton and groups supporting her had outspent Trump and his allies on ads $ 189 million to $ 50 million through the end of last week , according to advertising data compiled by the firm Advertising Analytics for NBC News .\nA constellation of super PACs devoted to Trump have struggled to raise money .
