Clinton is looking to New York to solidify her role as front-runner, while a strong showing -- or a victory -- for Sanders would deal a significant blow to her confidence and bolster his campaign's argument that the party's so-called super delegates should switch their allegiance to him.\n\nHere are six takeaways from the most combative Democratic debate yet:\n\n1. A question of judgment\n\nThe Democratic candidates took sharp aim at one another almost immediately over a series of issues, including the Iraq War, Wall Street and questions about judgment and qualifications to be president.\n\nBoth contenders shifted back and forth between offense and defense, a sharp departure from the calmer tone of the party's earlier debates.\n\nSanders began by explaining a recent comment he made on the campaign trail in which he suggested Clinton was \"unqualified\" to be president.\n\n\"Does Secretary Clinton have the experience and intelligence to be president? Of course she does. But I do question her judgment,\" Sanders said, pointing to her Senate vote for war in Iraq, her willingness for her campaign to benefit from millions of dollars spent on her behalf by super PACs and her relationship to Wall Street.\n\n\"Senator Sanders did call me unqualified.

With time running out before Democrats go the polls, Clinton's aggressive tactics suggest that she knows she needs to start making some of the blows against Sanders count.\n\n3. 'Think big' or get things done?\n\nA key difference in Clinton's and Sanders' approaches to governing was on full display during the debate over climate change.\n\nClinton is a politician who is content with incremental change, seeing it as the most realistic -- if not the only -- way to achieve her goals. The Vermont senator wants sweeping change, and believes the nation's problems are too big for singles and doubles. He wants to swing for the fences.\n\nTheir debate over climate change, in particular, highlighted their contrasting philosophies.\n\n\"Incremental steps are not enough,\" Sanders said after Clinton knocked him for faulting the recent international Paris agreement on climate change.\n\nClinton fired back, \"I don't take a back seat to your legislation that you have introduced that you have been unable to get passed.\"\n\nThis is the heart of their differences: To Sanders, the Paris climate agreement does not go far enough, and therefore isn't good enough.

One place where Sanders and Clinton agreed: Regrets\n\nJUST WATCHED Hillary Clinton apologizes for husband's crime bill Replay More Videos ...

But no apology from Sanders on guns\n\nThe apologies largely stopped there, however, as Clinton took on Sanders over gun policy.\n\nWhen Blitzer said that a parent of a victim of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings had called on Sanders to apologize for opposing a measure that would allow victims of gun violence to sue firearms companies, he declined.\n\n\"I voted against this gun liability law because I was concerned that in rural areas all over this country, if a gun shop owner sells a weapon legally to somebody, and that person then goes out and kills somebody, I don't believe it is appropriate that that gun shop owner who just sold a legal weapon to be held accountable and be sued,\" Sanders said. \"But, what I do believe is when gun shop owners and others knowingly are selling weapons to people who should not have them -- somebody walks in. They want thousands of rounds of ammunition, or they want a whole lot of guns, yes, that gun shop owner or that gun manufacturer should be held liable.\"\n\n\"So, Senator, do you owe the Sandy Hook families an apology?\" Blitzer asked.\n\n\"No, I don't think I owe them an apology. They are in court today, and actually they won a preliminary decision today. They have the right to sue, and I support them and anyone else who wants the right to sue.\"",
