    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) The nation 's most elite conservative donors are just as split as Republican voters are about who to support for president -- and it 's keeping many of the leading moneymen on the sidelines of the campaign as it barrels through the summer of 2015 .\nOnly a quarter of the top conservative donors in 2012 and 2014 have decided to exclusively support one White House hopeful , according to a CNN analysis of super PAC filings posted Friday . In a splintered field where no presidential candidate holds a commanding lead , the records reveal in the clearest terms yet just how few financiers have made their decisions .\nSome , like casino magnate Sheldon Adelson , the party 's top giver in 2012 , have not cut any checks to Republican candidates ' allied groups . Others , like Houston Texans owner Bob McNair , have donated simultaneously to as many as four aspirants , spreading their money around the field .\n`` There 's nobody clearly ahead , '' said Jay Bergman , a top Republican donor who has given sparingly to the super PACs that have courted him for the past six months . `` Until that emerges , a lot of people are not going to commit themselves . ''\nMonths before they formally announced their bids , potential candidates courted contributors at lavish resorts and with one-on-one visits . This weekend , five Republican hopefuls will travel to Dana Point to woo the network of donors organized by Charles and David Koch , two of the country 's richest Americans who themselves have not donated to any candidate 's super PAC so far .\nThose groups raised $ 250 million in the first half of 2015 , records show , $ 103 million of which was raised by the super PAC supporting former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush . Four years ago , Mitt Romney 's super PAC led the field at the time by raising $ 12 million in the same filing period .\nThanks to 2010 Supreme Court decisions that led to an explosion in super PACs , which can accept unlimited donations from individuals and corporations , nearly every candidate has eyed the nation 's billionaires to bankroll their political ambitions . And the reports Friday reveal they 're as dependent as ever on their goodwill : A single hand 's worth of Republican funders comprise a majority of most of the allied outside spending groups that will go to war with one another this year as the Iowa caucuses approach .\nBut these donors ' influence will wane as more and more well-heeled contributors join in the political giving that they revolutionized in 2012 and 2014 . Fundraisers and Republican operatives say that when the super PACs file their next campaign finance reports in early January , many of the top donors will no longer be uncommitted .\n`` Voters , as well as donors , may have preferences , but the numbers are really soft , '' Saul Anuzis , a fundraiser for the Republican Governors Association , said of the current landscape . `` Just like any activist letting it play itself out , there are lots of donors letting the final process play itself out .

Among those donors , half are currently sitting out .\nBut for those who are giving , they seem to have a strong preference for the governors in the race .\nBush has a clear lead among the mega-donors in CNN 's analysis , with 30 % of the elite donors giving to his super PAC , Right to Rise USA . No other candidate in the race was able to persuade so many of the top conservative donors to open their wallets at this early stage .\nWisconsin Gov . Scott Walker has also made inroads with this elite group . In all , $ 19 million of the $ 20 million raised by Unintimidated PAC came from these top Republicans . A quarter of that came from Chicago Cubs owner Joe Ricketts and his wife , who gave $ 5 million .\nAnother favorite is New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie , but his mega-donors are hedging their bets .

Half of the elite donors who are giving this year donated to multiple groups .\n`` A lot of it is bet-hedging , '' said top donor John Jordan , who owns a California winery and is backing Scott Walker . `` That 's what a lot of people do if they like more than one . ''\nCandidates like Rubio , Fiorina and Louisiana Gov .
