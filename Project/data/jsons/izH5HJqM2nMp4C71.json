    "content": "Easy On The Ears : GOP Ads Adapt To Reach Women Voters\nIt 's only April , but it looks and sounds like October . More than $ 80 million has been spent on political advertising in only about a dozen Senate battleground states .\nMany ads aimed at women take the most obvious approach : Republicans putting their female candidates front and center ; Democrats attacking Republicans for waging a war on women .\nBut there 's more to it than that , says Republican ad-maker Ashley O'Connor .\n`` Women process information differently than men , '' O'Connor says . `` So much of political advertising focuses on conflict , and facts and figures , and I think that we 're already starting to see , when reaching women voters , there 's just new techniques need to be used , and a different tone , and more storytelling . ''\nO'Connor singles out an ad aired by Monica Wehby , a pediatric neurosurgeon seeking the Republican nomination for Senate in Oregon . In the ad , a woman tells the story of Webby operating on her daughter .\n`` Dr. Wehby was going to open her back and reconstruct my daughter 's entire lower spine , '' the woman says . `` She just hugged me and kissed my forehead , and she said , 'It 's going to be OK , sweetheart . I 've got her , and I am going to see you in a couple of hours . ' ``\n`` This is a 60-second ad and it 's not particularly issue-driven , '' O'Connor says of the spot . `` It sort of goes to this point that when talking to women , I do n't think you necessarily have to be delivering factual information to move them . I think connecting with their heart and really trying to build emotion is more effective . ''\nThat may sound a little sexist , but appealing to emotions is what all effective advertising does . And the fact that Republicans are trying to do it is the biggest new development in political ads aimed at women .\nIn a typical Republican superPAC ad from 2012 , for instance , a man intones a list of Democrats ' alleged failings over a soundtrack of ominous music : `` Family incomes down , 40 percent living paycheck to paycheck , and Obamacare 's new tax on middle-class families . ''\nThis year , the GOP has ditched the baritone narrator , the scary music and the facts and figures . Instead , the party is doing what Democrats have been doing for many years : using softer voices and more personal stories .\nA Republican superPAC ad running this year features a woman who narrates in a conversational tone : `` People do n't like political ads . I do n't like them either . But health care is n't about politics . It 's about people . It 's not about a website that does n't work ... It 's about people , and millions of people have lost their health insurance . ... Obamacare does n't work . ''\nElizabeth Wilner , senior vice president with Kantar Media , praises the ad .\n`` It 's a very clean ad , '' Wilner says . `` The tone of the ad , her tone , is very sympathetic and very easy on the ears . It 's a new kind of attack ad , and it is not a harsh ad in any way , but the message itself is very tough . ''\nThere are other trends this year that both parties hope will appeal to women . Family members are everywhere in ads , especially moms and daughters .\nIn a Florida special election to fill the seat vacated by Republican Rep. Trey Radel , candidate Curt Clawson 's mother appears in an ad to endorse her son . In the same race , Paige Kreegel 's wife criticizes `` nasty '' campaign ads .\nIn Iowa , the children of Monica Vernon , also running for Congress , promise their mom `` will never stop working for the middle class . ''\nNot only is the content of the ads changing , but so are the places in which they appear . Jim Margolis , a veteran Democratic ad-maker , says it 's no longer enough to air an ad on daytime TV , or even the nightly news , to reach women .\n`` We are using data and analytics to try to determine what are the actual programs that women are watching , Margolis says . `` And to try to determine , as well , what are those issues , for that particular group , that are going to be the most resonant , that they 're going to find the most compelling . ''\nWherever women are digitally , Margolis says , political ads will find them . A woman who is a Democratic target voter in a Senate battleground state might see campaign ads all day online .\n`` When you log on in the morning to check the weather , there 's a pretty good chance that somebody is going to be talking to you right there , '' he says .\nYour browsing history can say a lot about you , Margolis says , including your gender , interests and issues that matter to you .\nThese new ways of targeting women voters , with content tailored to women 's concerns , are becoming common .
