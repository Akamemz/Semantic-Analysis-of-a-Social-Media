    "content": "Kanye West , Jordan Peterson , and the revolt against political correctness\nOn May 15 , 1939 , philosopher John Dewey issued a statement to the press announcing the formation of the Committee for Cultural Freedom . Attached were the committee \u2019 s declaration of principles and the names of 96 signatories . The following day , at a meeting inside Columbia University \u2019 s Low Library , the committee adopted its official manifesto . \u201c Never before in modern times , \u201d the document began , \u201c has the integrity of the writer , the artists , the scientist , and the scholar been threatened so seriously . \u201d\nThe committee \u2019 s members included anthropologists , philosophers , journalists , dramatists , attorneys , educators , and historians . Politically , they ran the gamut from democratic socialists to New Deal liberals to 19h-century liberals who embraced the market without serious qualification . What unified them was their commitment \u201c to propagate courageously the ideal of untrammeled intellectual activity. \u201d The \u201c fundamental criteria for evaluating all social philosophies today , \u201d their manifesto read , are \u201c whether it permits the thinker and the artist to function independently of political , religious , or racial dogmas. \u201d The basis for this alliance between such disparate persons , they continued , was \u201c the least common denominator of a civilized culture \u2014 the defense of creative and intellectual freedom . \u201d\nIt was the existence of Popular Front groups who toed the Stalinist line in science , literature , social thought , and the arts that moved the committee \u2019 s chief organizer , Sidney Hook , to action . \u201c It seemed to me that it was necessary to challenge this massive phenomenon that was corrupting the springs of liberal opinion and indeed making a mockery of common sense , \u201d Hook wrote in his autobiography , Out of Step ( 1987 ) . \u201c I decided to launch a new movement , based on general principles whose validity would be independent of geographical or national boundaries and racial or class membership . \u201d\nHook \u2019 s committee was the precursor of the international Congress for Cultural Freedom , convened in Berlin in June 1950 , and the affiliated American Committee for Cultural Freedom organized in 1951 . At that first meeting in Berlin , Arthur Koestler read from the dais the \u201c Manifesto of Freedom , \u201d which held \u201c as self-evident \u201d that \u201c intellectual freedom is one of the inalienable rights of man , \u201d and that such freedom \u201c is defined first and foremost by his right to hold and express his own opinions , and particularly opinions which differ from those of his rulers . Deprived of his right to say \u2018 no , \u2019 man becomes a slave . \u201d\nThe America of 2018 , needless to say , is a much different place from the America of 1939 and 1951 . Nazi Germany is long gone , extinguished in a war that killed 60 million souls . The Soviet Union disappeared 27 years ago , after a Cold War that lasted some five decades . Print media have collapsed and been replaced by digital and social media that limit the power of gatekeepers and extend the reach of minority viewpoints . If the late 1930s and early 1950s are the baseline , the world of 2018 is much more free .\nBut threats remain . Totalitarian systems in Russia , China , and their former Marxist-Leninist satellites have transformed , with the exception of North Korea , into systems of authoritarian control that permit some economic liberty while maintaining state sovereignty over politics , society , and culture . The authoritarians use \u201c sharp power \u201d to interfere in democratic elections , bully and exploit Western corporations and universities , and influence public discourse through information warfare . A renascent Marxism competes with , and to a large extent has been subsumed by , the ideology of multiculturalism and its attendant identity politics .\nIt is this ideology and politics that have captured America \u2019 s most prestigious intellectual , cultural , and media institutions . The university , Silicon Valley , Hollywood , and increasingly formerly \u201c neutral \u201d and \u201c objective \u201d platforms such as the New York Times and The Atlantic have come under the sway of racial and sexual dogmas and attitudes that brook no disagreement . Membership in these institutions , which play a crucial role in elite opinion formation , and the social networks in which they are embedded , is contingent on agreement with or silence about certain ideas of \u201c white privilege , \u201d patriarchal \u201c oppression , \u201d \u201c Islamophobia , \u201d and \u201c gender fluidity. \u201d To dissent from these ideas \u2014 to exercise one \u2019 s right to say no \u2014 invites not only anathematization from polite society but also the loss of one \u2019 s job and , in some cases , physical threats .\nThe ferocity with which challenges to the ideology are met signifies not power but weakness . All it takes to end the hegemony of political correctness is to combat or ignore its will to intimidation . And that is happening .\nJust as happened in the 20th century , an unlikely group of compatriots has emerged to resist the contemporary domestic challenge to cultural freedom . Reading Bari Weiss \u2019 s recent article on the \u201c intellectual dark web , \u201d one can not help being struck by the diversity of opinion and partisan allegiance among the renegade thinkers challenging political correctness and its stigmatization of arguments that violate its axioms of group identity , racial strife , and transgenderism . A stultifying intellectual atmosphere , in which the subjective emotional responses of designated victim groups take precedent over style , argument , and empirical evidence , makes for unexpected alliances . Who would have thought that Kanye West would become , in the space of a few tweets , the most famous and recognized champion of individual free thought in the world today ? Who could have anticipated that New Atheist Sam Harris would find himself in a united front with Jordan Peterson , who instructs his millions of acolytes in the continued relevance of biblical stories ?\nThe new advocates for cultural freedom are different from their forebears . They are more ethnically and sexually diverse . Practically all of them operate outside the academy . They are not self-consciously organized as a movement . To some extent , of course , this lack of institutionalization is related to present historical conditions . The mid 20th century was an era of bigness , of vast bureaus , of hierarchical corporations where political life , especially on the left , was divided and subdivided into party , committee , and cell . The early 21st century is too fractured , disaggregated , and anarchic for such precise construction and coordination . This is a time of weak relationships , of loose affiliations .

And because our media is unbundled , and the multiple means of personal expression so accessible , no one authority has monopoly power to distinguish reasonable dissenters from cranks .
