    "content": "Republicans are in the lead in the most competitive House and Senate races for the 2014 midterm elections , a reflection of President Barack Obama 's low job approval rating and disenchantment with Obamacare , a new poll has found.In a poll by Politico conducted May 2-13 of 867 likely voters , 41 percent of respondents said they would choose a Republican compared to 34 percent who said they would choose a Democrat.Roughly 25 percent are unsure of their preference . `` Both Obama 's job approval and the partisan ballot matchup are markedly more negative for Democrats in this poll than other national surveys \u2014 a reflection of the political reality that the midterm campaign is being fought on turf that is more challenging for Democrats than the nation as a whole , '' Politico said.At the same time , the poll also showed that even in a number of conservative states and races that could be a toss-up , voters lean in the liberal direction on a number of issues on the Democratic Party agenda , including immigration reform , pay equity , and background checks for gun sales.Voters , however , prioritize these issues much lower than healthcare , with nearly 9 out of 10 people saying their view on healthcare would be an important determinant of their vote , including 49 percent who said it would be very important , according to Politico.Among those surveyed who had an opinion of the Affordable Care Act , the electorate was almost exactly split between those who want to repeal the law entirely ( 48 percent ) and those who favor either leaving it alone ( 16 percent ) or keeping it in place with modifications ( 35 percent ) . `` At the same time that the healthcare law is plainly a political anchor for Democrats , the poll signals that fully killing the ACA may not be a slam-dunk as a political proposition and could be a more complicated issue for a GOP presidential ticket to negotiate in 2016 , '' Politico said.The survey also found that majorities of white voters ( 54 percent ) and men ( 51 percent ) support repealing Obamacare , but a majority of most subgroups do not support repeal , including independents , moderates , African-Americans , and Hispanics . `` The midterm electorate , however , is expected to be whiter and more conservative than the country as a whole , and many of the year 's highest-stakes Senate races are in Southern states , such as Arkansas , North Carolina , and Louisiana . So even if the law has gained some legitimacy with the broader public , it remains ominous for Democrats that repeal is the plurality position of likely voters , '' Politico said .",
