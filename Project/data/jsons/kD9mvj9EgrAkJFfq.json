Security Council has approved a resolution condemning construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank , after the U.S. abstained from the vote rather than vetoing the resolution outright .\nIn explaining the U.S. abstention , Ambassador Samantha Power said the move does n't signal diminished U.S. support for Israel ; she later added that the continued construction of settlements `` seriously undermines Israel 's security . ''\nPower said , `` The United States has been sending the message that the settlements must stop , privately and publicly , for nearly five decades . ''\n`` A day after Egypt withdrew the resolution under pressure from Israel and President-elect Donald Trump , several other Security Council members brought the draft to a vote . Fourteen supported it ; Power was the only one to abstain . ''\nLess than an hour after the vote , Trump tweeted , `` As to the U.N. , things will be different after Jan . 20th . ''\nAt the start of Power 's remarks explaining the U.S. position on the resolution , the ambassador read aloud a quote she said was from President Ronald Reagan , in 1982 :\n`` The United States will not support the use of any additional land for the purpose of settlements during the transitional period . Indeed , the immediate adoption of a settlement freeze by Israel , more than any other action , could create the confidence needed for wider participation in these talks . Further settlement activity is in no way necessary for the security of Israel , and only diminishes the confidence of the Arabs that a final outcome can be freely and fairly negotiated . ''\nPower said that in addition to condemning settlements , the resolution `` reflects the facts on the ground , '' condemns violence and terrorism and addresses `` counter-productive actions by the Palestinians '' while also calling on both sides to engage in peace talks .\nThe U.S. abstention comes one day after President-elect Trump issued a statement calling on the U.S. to veto the resolution .\n`` As the United States has long maintained , peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians will only come through direct negotiations between the parties , and not through the imposition of terms by the United Nations , '' Trump said .
