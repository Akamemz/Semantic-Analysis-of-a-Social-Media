But since then the rate has fallen very fast . It looks like 2014 will be better than the previous few years in terms of reduction in long term unemployed .\n2013 and 2014 were the years of the `` do nothing '' Congress , yet jobs gains and economic growth were the best of Obama 's time in office .
