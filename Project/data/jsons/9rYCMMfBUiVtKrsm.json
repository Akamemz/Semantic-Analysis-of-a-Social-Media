Jeff Flake , of Arizona , in a searing speech .\nFlake \u2019 s speech on the floor of the Senate on Tuesday will prove a historic document in American politics . It is an explosive denunciation of the president of the United States , and of his Republican enablers . Flake has long been critical of President Trump , but he has never made his case so starkly , nor condemned his fellow Republicans for their silence and cowardice so clearly .\nBut in choosing to retire rather than run for reelection , Flake is sending the worst possible message to his colleagues , empowering the president he loathes , and accelerating the takeover of the Republican Party that he laments .\nAmerica does not need Flake \u2019 s courageous retirement . It needs his courageous reelection campaign .\n\u201c It is often said that children are watching . Well , they are . \u201d\nFlake \u2019 s speech is worth reading in full , but a few particular quotes are worth pulling out :\n\u201c It is often said that children are watching . Well , they are . And what are we going to do about that ? When the next generation asks us , why did n't you do something ? Why did n't you speak up ? What are we going to say ? Mr. President , I rise today to say , enough . We must dedicate ourselves to making sure that the anomalous never becomes the normal . \u201d\n\u201c Were the shoe on the other foot , would we Republicans meekly accept such display from dominant Democrats ? Of course we would n't , and we would be wrong if we did . \u201d\n\u201c When we remain silent and fail to act when we know that silence and inaction is the wrong thing to do , because of political considerations , because we might make enemies , because we might alienate the base , because we might provoke a primary challenge , because ad infinitum , ad nauseam , when we succumb to those considerations in spite of what should be greater considerations and imperatives in defense of our institutions and our liberty , we dishonor our principles and forsake our obligations . \u201d\n\u201c None of this is normal . And what do we , as United States senators , have to say about it ? The principles that underlie our politics , the values of our founding , are too vital to our identity and to our survival to allow them to be compromised by the requirements of politics . Because politics can make us silent when we should speak , and silence can equal complicity . \u201d\nBut here , at the end , was Flake \u2019 s confounding conclusion : \u201c I will not be complicit or silent . I 've decided that I would be better represent the people of Arizona and to better serve my country and my conscience by freeing myself of the political consideration that consumed far too much bandwidth and would cause me to compromise far too many principles . To that end , I 'm announcing today that my service in the Senate will conclude at the end of my term in early January 2019 . \u201d\nParties are won and lost in elections , and Flake is abandoning that fight\nFlake \u2019 s decision to retire so he can speak his mind is certainly preferable to choosing to seek reelection while remaining silent . But these are extraordinary times , and they demand more than retirement . Perhaps Flake would have lost reelection if he ran in a Republican primary on the principles and moral behavior he believes in . Perhaps he would have lost if he had mounted an independent candidacy on the principles and moral behavior he believes in . But maybe he would have won , and if he did win , he would have emboldened others in his party , and outside his party , to follow his example .\nThree Republican senators have now reoriented themselves to forcefully oppose Trump .

But it is a shame .\nThe souls of political parties are won and lost in elections . For the Republican Party to be recaptured by candidates like Flake and Corker requires candidates like Flake and Corker to face down the Trumpist faction of their base and win .

His reelection campaign was endangered at best . But to proclaim the job impossible and retire in expectation of a loss is to say that the only Republicans who can speak out against Trump are those who have abandoned any hope of a political future .
