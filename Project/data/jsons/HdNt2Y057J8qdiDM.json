It 's when people across the country pick their senators , representatives in Congress and governors and vote on state ballot initiatives , which can range from legalizing marijuana to raising the minimum wage .\nThe main political result everyone is waiting for is whether Democrats keep control of the Senate , which they 've held since 2006 . While a shift in the balance of power is the big drama , there is more at stake in every state .\nHere are 50 facts to help you understand what 's happening in the election .\nAlabama wins for dullest race . Republican Jeff Sessions , a three-term senator , faced no challengers in the primary or general election . He would chair the Budget Committee if Republicans take control of the Senate .\nIn Alaska , voters will have a chance to legalize the recreational use of marijuana ( if you 're an adult ) , a step approved two years ago by voters in Colorado and Washington state .\nDemocratic Rep. Ron Barber won a full term in 2012 to succeed Democrat Gabrielle Giffords , who was shot in the head in 2011 . He was one of her staffers wounded in the attack . Barber faces a rematch with Republican Martha McSally , a retired Air Force colonel .\nFor most of the USA , prohibition ended in the 1930s . Not in Arkansas , where 37 dry counties prohibit alcohol sales . Some people in the state are trying to change that . There 's a ballot initiative that would legalize the manufacture and sale of alcohol statewide .\nCalifornia is in the third year of one of the state 's worst droughts in the past century . A new water bond would provide $ 7 billion for water quality , supply and infrastructure improvement projects in the drought-ridden state .\nAbortion is a hot topic in Colorado . A `` personhood '' amendment would add fetuses to those protected by the state 's criminal and wrongful death act . Opponents say it would ban abortions .\nConnecticut is a blue state , but Democratic Gov . Dan Malloy is in a tight re-election fight with Republican businessman Tom Foley . It 's a rematch for the two candidates .\nIn the Senate , Democratic Sen. Chris Coons won a 2010 special election to fill Joe Biden 's old Senate seat . He 's a safe bet for re-election this year . In the House , two-term Democrat John Carney should also have an easy path to re-election .\nWhen is there not political drama in the Sunshine State ? In Florida , spending on ads by parties , candidates and interest groups was approaching $ 82 million by late October , the Center for Public Integrity reports , leading to a rate of nearly 101 TV spots per hour \u2014 most , not surprisingly , aimed at the hotly contested governor 's race between Republican Gov . Rick Scott and Democrat Charlie Crist .\nGov . Nathan Deal , a Republican whose first term was tarnished by ethics allegations , faces Democrat Jason Carter , grandson of former president Jimmy Carter .\n11 . Hawaii : Gubernatorial candidate made history last time he won , now he 's favored\nGov . Neil Abercrombie was ousted in the Democratic primary by state Sen.

There are no Senate races , the governor 's race is n't for another two years , and there 's not much drama in the state 's nine House contests .\nDemocratic Sen. Tom Harkin is retiring . Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley had the field pretty much to himself until state Sen. Joni Ernst broke out of the GOP pack and won the primary with Sarah Palin 's backing . But Braley has a high-profile woman in his corner , too : Michelle Obama . The only problem is she ca n't pronounce his name . The first lady flubbed Braley 's last name seven times in remarks Oct. 11 at Drake University , calling the four-term congressman `` Bruce Bailey . '' Then the White House mistakenly reported Braley was running for governor .\nRepublican Sen. Pat Roberts has been dogged the whole cycle over whether he has a home in Kansas . He overcame a primary challenge from a Tea Party-backed candidate . But the drama did n't end there .

Mike Michaud and independent Eliot Cutler .\n20 . Maryland : Anthony Brown could become Maryland 's first black governor\nThe lieutenant governor of Maryland wants a promotion .

His Democrat challenger , Bob Goodman , came in second in his primary to the ballot option `` None of These Candidates . ''\nNew Hampshire is all about shaking things up . The state elects its governor every two years , whereas most other states do it every four years . Maggie Hassan , a former Senate majority leader , is seeking a second term .

She was head of Rep. Paul Ryan 's debate prep as the 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee and also served in the George W. Bush administration in economic and domestic policy jobs . She is running against Democrat Aaron Woolf for the seat of a retiring Democrat . Elizabeth Holtzman , a New York Democrat , was 31 when she was elected to Congress in 1972 .\n33 . North Carolina : Pizza delivery guy could draw votes from major candidates\nFirst-term Sen. Kay Hagan won this swing state in 2008 , running on the same ticket as President Obama . In 2012 , North Carolina went for Mitt Romney . For months , Hagan has been taking hits for supporting the Affordable Care Act . Her general election opponent is Republican state House Speaker Thom Tillis . Libertarian pizza deliveryman Sean Haugh could draw voters away from both major-party candidates .\n34 .
