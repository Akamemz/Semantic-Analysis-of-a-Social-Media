We \u2019 re the younger service , the more progressive service , \u201d says Coretta Gray , a former officer in the Air Force Judge Advocate General 's Corps . \u201c We \u2019 re in a better position to lead than almost any other service . \u201d\nOne encouraging conclusion of the GAO report is that , though Black service members across all military branches were more likely to be prosecuted , they were no more likely to be convicted .\nIn the Air Force , efforts to address racial disparities have included efforts to recruit more Black officers : Last month the Air Force increased the number of full-tuition scholarships available at historically Black colleges and universities by roughly 60 % . The service has also launched \u201c unconscious bias \u201d training .\nThe military is under pressure to fix racial disparities within its justice system , after the U.S. Government Accountability Office report concluded that within the military , allegations against Black service members are more than twice as likely to be brought to a court-martial hearing as those against white service members .\nTwo years ago , the U.S. military decided to prosecute a Black service member for being six minutes late to a meeting , bringing his case to a court-martial hearing and , ultimately , a conviction .\n\u201c That \u2019 s a decision that truly should not have been made , \u201d retired Col. Don Christensen , who previously served as the Air Force \u2019 s chief prosecutor , told lawmakers in a House Armed Services Committee hearing last month , citing the incident as evidence of racial bias inherent in the U.S. military justice system . \u201c I have never seen anybody court-martialed for the sole offense of being six minutes late to a meeting \u2013 other than this African American . \u201d\nThough he never prosecuted anyone he thought was innocent , he says , nor did he ever see any of his colleagues doing this , Colonel Christensen , who now runs the service member advocacy group Protect Our Defenders , says the problem is that white troops are \u201c getting the benefit of the doubt , whether based upon the relationship , implicit bias , explicit bias , whatever it was , \u201d while Black troops aren \u2019 t .\nA U.S. Government Accountability Office report released last year backs these concerns . It concluded that within the military , allegations against Black service members are more than twice as likely to be brought to a court-martial hearing as those against white service members .\nNow the Defense Department is under pressure to find out what is going wrong and to fix it . \u201c This report raises difficult questions \u2013 questions that demand answers , \u201d Lt. Gen. Charles Pede , judge advocate general for the U.S. Army , told lawmakers . \u201c Sitting here today , we do not have those answers . \u201d\nIn the wake of the GAO report , lawmakers added a provision in the most recent defense budget requiring all services to track the same data on racial disparities within the military justice system , to root out causes and find solutions . Critics point out that there has been ample missed opportunity to do just that , however : Pentagon studies over the years have concluded that racial disparities since 1972 were \u201c consistent and persistent and getting worse . \u201d\nIt was as America mobilized for World War II that U.S. military leaders became increasingly concerned about racism in its ranks . Black troops assigned to Southern bases \u201c had no right to freedom from harassment and physical violence , in large part because the military police frequently chose to attack rather than protect them , \u201d notes Douglas Bristol , associate professor and specialist in Black military history at the University of Southern Mississippi .\nIn a disturbingly discriminatory incident typical of the era , three Black soldiers in Houston were having drinks on their night off base when a white policeman called them the n-word . One of the GIs corrected him . \u201c I am not a n * soldier \u2013 we are American soldiers , \u201d he said . The cop told the Black troops that if they objected again he would kill them . When the cop called for backup , a white MP responded to the scene , telling the Black soldiers that they were in the South where they were \u201c n * s and would be treated as such. \u201d The three soldiers were thrown in jail , charged with inciting to riot , which was \u201c not an entirely bad outcome considering that armed white MPs frequently patrolled the Black neighborhoods of Houston and viciously beat Black soldiers , \u201d Dr. Bristol says .\nTop military commanders generally dismissed racial discrimination as an unavoidable problem from civilian life until , that is , it began posing a threat to the war effort . When anger over mistreatment caused riots to break out among Black troops at bases throughout the U.S. \u2013 among U.S. troops executed after courts-martial in Europe , 80 % were Black , though they comprised only 10 % of U.S. forces \u2013 Gen. George Marshall , then-Army chief of staff , threatened to fire commanders who did not \u201c personally and vigorously \u201d address racism . He also ordered better training for MPs , the use of Black MPs , and new grievance procedures for Black troops , Dr. Bristol says . \u201c The new policies worked , and although incidents still occurred , their frequency and number diminished greatly . \u201d\nBut while the military has taken \u201c tremendous strides \u201d to end institutional racism , it still has \u201c a long way to go towards addressing \u201d racial disparities in its ranks , says retired Maj. Coretta Gray , who was inspired to join the Air Force after her mom served as a military nurse and her dad as a space and missiles officer . \u201c My anticipation going in was that it would be just like anywhere else in America \u2013 yes , we have issues with race , but that it \u2019 s more of a meritocracy . \u201d\nWhile she was serving in the Air Force as a judge advocate general , or lawyer , however , Major Gray , who is Black , saw disparities in how Black and white troops were treated . Though most supervisors \u201c don \u2019 t want to tear everybody up or to be prejudiced , \u201d they do behave in ways that are , often inadvertently , discriminatory , she says .\nAs the Air Force began to dig into their data , they found two offenses most likely to show discipline disparities by race . One is marijuana use , and the other is known as \u201c failure to go , \u201d or being late for work or a meeting . Marijuana charges are \u201c usually \u201d the result of random urinalysis , based on the generation of social security numbers by health services , says Ann Stefanek , chief of Air Force Media Operations .\nThe \u201c failure to go \u201d charges gave Air Force officials pause . \u201c Is the white supervisor treating Black and white airmen the same the first time they \u2019 re late for work ? Maybe the young white airmen from an area with limited diversity encounters a Black airman for the first time , and maybe the way they deal with each other is completely different , \u201d Ms. Stefanek says .\nFor her part , Major Gray says , when she took part in regular meetings with commanders on the status of discipline in various units , \u201c I \u2019 ve literally heard in that meeting , \u2018 These Black airmen just get in trouble more . \u2019 \u201d\nThe disciplinary record may actually bear that out , she adds , but the charges often hinge on how minor infractions of new service members are handled by young supervisors . One airman may be punished for going AWOL , for example , while another may be told , \u201c Hey , you better get yourself back to base before you \u2019 re declared AWOL , \u201d Major Gray notes . \u201c I don \u2019 t think we arm those front-line supervisors with enough training . \u201d\nAs a result , young supervisors may treat discipline \u201c less professionally and more like a social club , \u201d she says . \u201c It \u2019 s about whether \u2018 I know you and we go out on weekends and you helped me move , \u2019 versus \u2018 You get this paperwork because I only see you at work and we don \u2019 t connect . \u2019 \u201d\nFor troops inclined towards racism , it can also be a chance for \u201c personal prejudice to have a ton of room to run , \u201d she says . This might include giving a new recruit they don \u2019 t like \u201c all the bad tasks , making them work overtime , punishing them for not wearing their [ hat ] before they go outside \u2013 all the high school bullying stuff , but with real consequences . \u201d\nIf people complain about unequal treatment , they can easily be gaslit , Major Gray says . \u201c They \u2019 re told , \u2018 You took that wrong , \u2019 or \u2018 I \u2019 m sure they were just joking , \u2019 or \u2018 There was some other reason you didn \u2019 t get that particular job or training opportunity. \u2019 Sometimes it \u2019 s , \u2018 They just don \u2019 t like your attitude . \u2019\n\u201c But why is it that it \u2019 s all these Black females who have an attitude ? Some have told me , \u2018 I was literally sitting in my resting face , and he told me I had an attitude . \u2019 \u201d\nThere \u2019 s often a legitimate reason for disciplinary action , particularly among new troops , and \u201c of course you should be on time to meetings , \u201d Ms. Gray says , \u201c so these cases for the most part run in a way that it \u2019 s hard to point out any racism directly . \u201d\nThe biggest step the military could take toward substantiating some of these biases , whether conscious or unconscious , is through the tracking of low-level administrative paperwork \u2013 the letters of counseling , admonishment , and reprimand \u2013 that generally don \u2019 t account for courts-martial in themselves , but when they accumulate can be used to build a bigger case for a denied promotion or dismissal .\n\u201c I can already hear people groaning , \u2018 Oh , another metric to track , \u201d Ms. Gray says . \u201c But the perception is that you \u2019 re not going to get the benefit of the doubt if you \u2019 re Black . I \u2019 ve seen it . \u201d\nCol. Bill Orr , associate director of the Air Force judiciary and a retired JAG and military trial judge , agrees , particularly since the racial disparities overwhelmingly crop up among younger troops . His department plans to begin tracking this data , he says . Adds Ms. Stefanek , \u201c We acknowledge that the numbers tell a story , and we need to get to the bottom of why those numbers reflect what they do . \u201d\nIt doesn \u2019 t help military justice , officials say , that the officer corps isn \u2019 t more diverse . For example , when he retired in 2014 , Col. Christensen told lawmakers , only 1 in 124 colonels in the Air Force JAG Corps were Black . Throughout the Pentagon , 78 % of officers are white , and 8 % are Black . There are two African American four-star generals in the U.S. military .\nColonel Orr , who is Black , says he remembers what it feels like to be the only Black officer in the room . \u201c I see new JAGs go through the same thing and you \u2019 re trying to convince them to stay. \u201d He tells them , \u201c I wouldn \u2019 t have spent 30-something years in the Air Force if I didn \u2019 t think this is a good place to be . They need to have the impression that somebody does care \u2013 that somebody does understand what it \u2019 s like to be the only person in the room . \u201d\nIn the wake of the HASC hearing , the Air Force last month increased the number of full-tuition scholarships available at historically black colleges and universities by roughly 60 % , in an effort to get more Black officers into its ranks .\nThe Air Force has also launched unconscious bias training , designed to point out inadvertent ways in which service members and leaders may be perpetuating racism . It will be an important \u201c conversation starter , \u201d Colonel Orr says . \u201c It will help keep people from committing unforced errors . \u201d\nOne encouraging conclusion of the GAO report is that in terms of convictions and punishment , there is no statistical difference between Black and white troops , \u201c except for Black service members in the Navy were less likely to be dismissed or discharged after a conviction , \u201d Brenda Farrell , director of the GAO \u2019 s Defense Capabilities and Management Team , told lawmakers .\nIn other words , she said , though Black service members were more likely to be prosecuted , they were no more likely \u2013 and in some cases , less likely \u2013 to be convicted . \u201c That makes sense from what I saw , \u201d Major Gray says . \u201c Once you make it to the court-martial and have all eyes on it , it evens out .
