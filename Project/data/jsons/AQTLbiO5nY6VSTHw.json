    "content": "As protests against police violence spread to every state in the U.S. and dramatic images flooded in from cities across the country , President Donald Trump and his attorney general spun an ominous story of opportunistic leftists exploiting a national trauma to sow chaos and disorder . They were the anti-fascists known as \u201c antifa , \u201d and according to the administration they were domestic terrorists who would be policed accordingly . But while the White House beat the drum for a crackdown on a leaderless movement on the left , law enforcement offices across the country were sharing detailed reports of far-right extremists seeking to attack the protesters and police during the country \u2019 s historic demonstrations , a trove of newly leaked documents reveals . Among the steady stream of threats from the far-right were repeated encounters between law enforcement and heavily armed adherents of the so-called boogaloo movement , which welcomes armed confrontation with cops as means to trigger civil war . With much of the U.S. policing apparatus on the hunt for antifa instigators , those violent aspirations appear to have materialized in a string of targeted attacks in California that left a federal protective services officer and a sheriff \u2019 s deputy dead and several other law enforcement officials wounded . The cache of law enforcement materials was recently hacked and posted online under the title \u201c BlueLeaks , \u201d providing an unprecedented look at the communications between state , local , and federal law enforcement in the face of the nationwide protests . In an analysis of nearly 300 documents that reference \u201c antifa , \u201d \u2588\u2588\u2588 found repeated instances of antifa and left-wing protesting activities cast in cartoonishly grim terms alongside more substantive reports of lethal right-wing violence and threats that have received scant mention from top Trump administration officials . \u201c Throughout the documents you see counterterrorism agencies using extremism so broadly as to mean virtually anything that encompasses dissent , \u201d Hina Shamsi , director of the ACLU \u2019 s National Security Project , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c There are instances in which people engaging in white supremacist violence get the benefit of the doubt as potential lone offenders , while people of color and those who dissent against government injustice are smeared as threats with guilt by association . \u201d\nMichael German , a former FBI agent specializing in domestic terrorism and current fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice , said the materials were rife with examples of law enforcement intelligence being politicized in ways that endangered both protesters and police alike . \u201c Terrorism is distinguished from other violence by its political nature and , as a result , counterterrorism is often highly politicized as well , \u201d German told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c Here we \u2019 re seeing where this politicization of counterterrorism is being reflected in intelligence documents that are going out and are intended to inform state and local law enforcement on the ground. \u201d He added : \u201c Overall , what you see is a strange sensationalization of the antifa threats \u2014 and that doesn \u2019 t exist when looking at the boogaloo documents. \u201d German argued that the impulse to paint both sides of the political spectrum with the same brush , despite the fact that only the far right is actively killing people , is among the most dangerous features of modern American law enforcement . In his review of the documents produced in response to the recent protests , German said purported \u201c threats \u201d from antifa were routinely overblown , often framed vandalism as terrorism and were typically absent of concrete evidence of serious criminal activity . \u201c It \u2019 s chatter , it \u2019 s \u2018 intelligence reporting suggests , \u2019 \u201d he said . On June 2 , for example , the Department of Homeland Security circulated a tweet to law enforcement agencies across the country reporting that antifa was stashing bricks to \u201c fuel protests. \u201d The intelligence made its way to a law enforcement fusion center in Maine . Last week , Mainer magazine tracked down the original source of the tweet : a far-right , pro-Trump biker who goes by the name \u201c the Wolfman , \u201d who claimed that Facebook kept deleting his brick-planting evidence \u201c because they are BLM supporters . \u201d\n\u201c You have these heavily armed groups right there , who have a much more direct and lengthy history of violence than anything antifa or anarchist-involved does . \u201d\nEven if antifa were staging bricks , German said , \u201c you have these heavily armed groups right there , who have a much more direct and lengthy history of violence than anything antifa or anarchist-involved does. \u201d Unlike the information circulated about antifa , much of the intelligence reporting in the BlueLeaks documents regarding threats from the far right is tightly focused on specific events , German noted . \u201c That \u2019 s the way it should be , \u201d he said . Far-right extremists have been targeting and killing law enforcement , not to mention members of the general public , for generations , German explained , and in fact , the government \u2019 s own documents show that those ideas were percolating in extremist corners of the right at the same time that Trump and U.S. Attorney General William Barr were preparing to crack down on the left . While antifa has been a right-wing boogeyman for years , the administration \u2019 s rhetoric ramped up in late May , with Trump tweeting that he would designate the movement as a terrorist organization . Barr followed the tweet with a Department of Justice statement reporting that federal investigators would work to \u201c identify criminal organizers and instigators \u201d who were \u201c hijacking \u201d the protests , and warning that \u201c the violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly. \u201d In the weeks since Barr \u2019 s statement was issued , \u2588\u2588\u2588 has published accounts of FBI agents in multiple states targeting individuals with a perceived relationship to antifa for interviews and potential informant work . Meanwhile , the Trump Make America Great Again Committee , an official fundraising arm of the president , has been running campaign ads urging donors to send money to show support for the administration \u2019 s antifa enforcement campaign . Yet the leaked materials show that on May 29 , two days before Trump tweeted that antifa would be labeled a terrorist organization and Barr issued his DOJ statement , the president \u2019 s own DHS analysts issued an open source intelligence report detailing how a white supremacist channel on Telegram , an encrypted messaging service , was encouraging followers to capitalize on the unrest by targeting the police with Molotov cocktails and firearms . \u201c The use of firearms greatly influences the scale and intensity of these events , \u201d a source in the group , titled \u201c National Accelerationist Revival , \u201d wrote on May 27 , advising followers to break police lines \u201c with cocktails , chainsaws , and firearms. \u201d At the time , DHS reported , the group included more than 3,400 subscribers . \u201c Looting and shoplifting are both cool and whites should be doing it way more , \u201d the source went on . \u201c When the laws no longer benefit you , break them for personal gain . If you don \u2019 t feel like buying something , steal it . If you don \u2019 t feel like driving slow , drive fast . If you don \u2019 t like someone , hurt them. \u201d \u201c We ought to revel in the destruction of the police state , \u201d they wrote . \u201c It is just as necessary to break down the police state and the system of control as it is to spread racial hatred . \u201d\nIn a separate document disseminated the following day , DHS warned its workforce that the nation \u2019 s \u201c period of darkness \u201d would soon worsen , as \u201c violent protest movements \u201d grew . Domestic extremists would capitalize on the unrest to \u201c take over government facilities and attack law enforcement , \u201d DHS predicted , with protests following police killings of civilians \u201c posing a high risk of escalating to both premeditated and random attacks targeting law enforcement officers nationwide. \u201d The document went on to describe how \u201c users of a white supremacist extremist Telegram channel attempted to incite followers to engage in violence and start the \u2018 boogaloo \u2019 \u2014 a term used by some violent extremists to refer to the start of a second Civil War \u2014 by shooting in a crowd. \u201d Among the developments cited in the bulletin was the May 29 assassination of a federal court security guard in Oakland . The alleged perpetrator would later be identified as Steven Carrillo , a 32-year-old sergeant in an elite Air Force security unit . According to authorities , Carrillo would go on to ambush and kill a sheriff \u2019 s deputy and wound several others in a second targeted attack days later . In court filings last month , the FBI reported that the airman had a ballistics vest bearing a boogaloo patch . Following a shootout with police , Carrillo reportedly used his own blood to scrawl phrases associated with the movement on the hood of a vehicle he had carjacked . In the run-up to the initial attack , federal authorities said Carrillo made several comments in a Facebook group with his accused accomplices arguing that the protests were an ideal opportunity to kill law enforcement \u2014 whom he referred to as \u201c soup bois , \u201d a reference to the \u201c alphabet soup \u201d of law enforcement titles \u2014 and kick off a broader nationwide conflagration . \u201c Go to the riots and support our own cause , \u201d Carrillo reportedly wrote on the morning of the attacks . \u201c Show them the real targets . Use their anger to fuel our fire . Think outside the box . We have mobs of angry people to use to our advantage. \u201d At approximately 9:44 p.m , Carrillo and his accused partner , Robert Alvin Justus Jr. , rolled up in a white van outside the Ronald V. Dellums Federal Building . The side door of the vehicle slid open and Carrillo opened fire . Fifty-three-year-old David Patrick Underwood was shot dead . His partner was wounded . \u201c Did you see how they fucking fell ? \u201d Justus would later recall Carrillo exclaiming , as the van took off into the night .\nWhile Carrillo was on the run in California , the FBI \u2019 s Minneapolis office circulated uncorroborated \u201c online discussions \u201d between unidentified individuals indicating that \u201c Antifa wanted to \u2018 massacre \u2019 National Guard personnel at the Minnesota State Capitol \u201d in an unprecedented vehicle-born explosive attack . In the June 1 report , the bureau \u2019 s Minneapolis office noted that the intelligence coming in was based on photos of National Guard vehicles that did not appear to come from Minnesota , that it was the product of an outside office , and that \u201c given current circumstances in the Twin Cities , the FBI Minneapolis Field Office cautions that the source may have potentially provided intelligence to influence recipients. \u201d That same morning , Trump tweeted a quote from \u201c Fox and Friends \u201d co-host Brian Kilmeade : \u201c I don \u2019 t see any indication that there were any white supremist [ sic ] groups mixing in . This is an ANTIFA Organization . It seems that the first time we saw it in a major way was Occupy Wall Street . It \u2019 s the same mindset. \u201d The president endorsed Kilmeade \u2019 s assessment , writing in all caps , \u201c TRUE ! \u201d Later in the day , Trump appeared in the Rose Garden of the White House to announce that he would mobilize military forces to quash \u201c the violence and restore security and safety in America. \u201d The president was quick to point out the role of \u201c professional anarchists , violent mobs \u2026 arsonists , looters , criminals , rider rioters , Antifa , and others \u201d in creating unrest . \u201c A federal officer in California , an African American enforcement hero , was shot and killed , \u201d he said , referring to Underwood and the targeted attack in Oakland .\nTrump made no mention of groups on the far right . Behind the scenes , however , DHS was acknowledging \u201c media reports \u201d indicating \u201c that neo-Nazi , and other paramilitary far-right groups , are calling for terror attacks during the ongoing unrest throughout the United States. \u201d \u201c A series of Telegram accounts linked to a wider network of paramilitary far-right extremists have indicated that ongoing disturbances are spreading America \u2019 s police forces thin , making this the ideal time to strike with a strategic attack , \u201d the agency reported in a round-up of intelligence reports coming in from around the country , published the following morning . \u201c One account , with thousands of followers and links to several neo-Nazi terror groups like The Base and the Nordic Resistance Movement , called for attacks on critical infrastructure. \u201d The agency noted that Twitter had recently removed a fake antifa account \u201c created by a known white supremacist group \u201d that had issued a call to violence . \u201c Although the account only had a few hundred followers , it is an example of white supremacists seeking to inflame tensions in the United States , \u201d DHS reported . According to a distribution list at the bottom of the report , the document was shared with the White House Situation Room , DHS headquarters , federal interagency operations centers , and state and local partners . \u2588\u2588\u2588 sent detailed lists of questions regarding documents in the BlueLeaks trove to the White House , the Department of Justice , and DHS . None responded . The FBI referred \u2588\u2588\u2588 to an interview director Christopher Wray gave to Fox News in a late June , in which he appeared to distance the bureau from the more strident antifa rhetoric of Barr and Trump . \u201c Our efforts are focused on identifying , investigating , and disrupting individuals that are inciting violence and engaging in criminal activity , \u201d the bureau said in a statement . \u201c We are not focused on peaceful protests. \u201c An Antifa Obsession Despite the apparent stream of intelligence indicating that the far right was looking to use the protests as cover to attack law enforcement and create disorder , the FBI , by June 2 , was still uncertain whether the attack in Oakland was linked to the demonstrations . \u201c At this time , the FBI is unable to determine if this incident is related to the civil unrest in the Oakland area , \u201d the bureau noted in a lengthy situation report . Carrillo \u2019 s arrest was still four days away . On the heels of Barr \u2019 s antifa statement , the FBI noted that its field offices had been \u201c encouraged to canvass sources for intelligence associated with violent or illegal extremist activity. \u201d The bureau added that \u201c any attempts by law enforcement to arrest individuals \u201d openly carrying guns at protests , as well as increased use of the National Guard , was likely to draw more anti-government militias into the streets . The 16-page FBI report did not mention the boogaloo movement nor any of the many other domestic extremist groups of the American far right , by name . It did , however , highlight antifa and anarchists more than a half dozen times .\nIn Newark , New Jersey , police and FBI investigators had identified \u201c a probable \u2018 Antifa \u2019 related individual , \u201d who was arrested for possessing a knife , a hatchet , and a jar of gasoline . Though the man \u2019 s charge was unclear , the FBI reported that it had \u201c obtained one of his Facebook posts which contained a video of him at the riots inciting others to steal from the stores while he stood guard. \u201d With the man having described himself as \u201c anti-government and anti-authority , \u201d the FBI reported that its Newark office \u201c believes this profile is consistent with \u2018 Antifa. \u2019 \u201d While agents were investigating the man in Newark , the FBI \u2019 s field office in Spokane , Washington , was looking into an \u201c antifa group \u201d reportedly headed through Idaho and on to Minneapolis . In Denver , meanwhile , the FBI was investigating the alleged transfer of \u201c riot supplies \u201d to \u201c antifa members , \u201d and in Philadelphia , authorities were \u201c attempting to confirm if any of the individuals arrested by Philadelphia Police Department have \u2018 Antifa \u2019 affiliations. \u201d The portrait the FBI painted of the country was chaotic , with nearly three dozen FBI SWAT teams in various stages of deployment nationwide . The report noted \u201c multiple officer related shootings \u201d in the 12 hours preceding its dissemination , including the killing of a police officer in Las Vegas and an \u201c assailant \u201d who allegedly fired on police officers and a National Guard patrol in Kentucky . Nearly 200 pistols and rifles had been stolen from locations in San Francisco and Albuquerque , New Mexico , the FBI reported ; it was unclear by whom . While a variety of groups had been linked to the unrest , the FBI noted that \u201c much of the violence and vandalism is perpetrated by opportunistic , individual actors acting without specific direction. \u201d Nonetheless , the bureau would \u201c continue to aggressively \u2026 seek to corroborate whether or not there is in fact an organized effort to incite violence by either known criminal groups or domestic violent extremists , \u201d which apparently included running down \u201c uncorroborated intelligence about alleged participation of Venezuelan and Nicaraguan socialist groups. \u201d According to the report , with more than 4,000 arrests across the country , the FBI had tagged nearly 200 incidents as \u201c riot related threats \u201d and was in the process of investigating 40 \u201c cases associated with violent protests. \u201d With Trump hyping antifa hysteria in Washington , D.C. , reports of lurking leftists began cropping around the country . In Colorado , a Denver resident reported that they had followed a \u201c suspicious person \u201d into their apartment complex who looked to be attempting to set the building on fire . \u201c Fairly certain he was a member of an Antifa like group , \u201d the resident wrote , adding that there were \u201c two Antifa safe houses on our block. \u201d \u201c I know this because they have been walking past our house telling us they can offer shelter , food , supplies , etc . also they have been hiding on our stoop when Swat drives by and they keep discussing their plans and where they are going . They have a central phone # they are calling to get updates and where they need to go to , \u201d the resident said . \u201c Please nip this shit in the ass . This is the second time in two days we had someone attempt to burn down our apartment building/neighboring buildings . Get these terrorists out of our city please ! \u201d\n\u201c Please nip this shit in the ass . This is the second time in two days we had someone attempt to burn down our apartment building/neighboring buildings . Get these terrorists out of our city please ! \u201d\nThe Colorado Information Analysis Center , a law enforcement fusion center , listed the type of activity described in the complaint as \u201c terrorism. \u201d CIAC did not respond to a request for comment for this story . It wasn \u2019 t just residents worried about antifa . CIAC also received a request from the Douglas County Sheriff \u2019 s Department seeking \u201c information on ANTIFA , and possibility of acts targeting our AOR \u201d \u2014 area of operations . In neighboring Nebraska , the FBI \u2019 s Omaha office was running down information indicating that an \u201c unidentified individual who claimed to be a member of ANTIFA \u201d had posted a Craigslist ad offering to \u201c pay up to 1,000 individuals $ 25 per hour to \u2018 cause as much chaos and destruction as possible \u2019 \u201d in \u201c nightly violent protests. \u201d In Virginia , the FBI warned that black lines spray-painted on federal buildings was a sign of antifa vandalism to come . All over the country , from California to Texas to West Virginia , law enforcement was chasing antifa leads and looking to hunt down instigators . The BlueLeaks documents suggest a borderline obsession on the part of some law enforcement offices with painting antifa , anarchists , and left-wing dissent more broadly as a serious terrorist threat . In early June , New Jersey \u2019 s Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness ( NJOHSP ) issued a two-page report detailing how legal observers with the National Lawyers Guild , a progressive association of attorneys and legal advocates that has been around since the 1930s and sends representatives to public protests to monitor police activity , were in fact \u201c an anarchist extremist subgroup. \u201d \u201c \u2018 Lawyers \u2019 may be identified by their bright neon green hats or clothing ; however , these individual [ sic ] may or may not be licensed lawyers , \u201d the office warned . \u201c Their role is to record information regarding the interactions Antifa members are having during an arrest . This individual will record the interaction with the aid of another member , while noting information . The \u2018 lawyer \u2019 will also obtain booking information and are known to argue with police over arrests and interactions. \u201d Anti-fascists were bent on infiltrating protests over the killing of George Floyd by Minnesota police Officer Derek Chauvin \u201c to further their violent ideology , \u201d the New Jersey office reported , and \u201c continue to attack government institutions ; use violent counter-protest tactics against adversarial groups , including law enforcement ; and target political figures representing disparate views. \u201d This was not the first time the New Jersey \u2019 s homeland security office had set its sights on leftists . In a 2018 report , the office compiled a color-coded chart of the biggest terror threats to New Jersey . Anarchist extremists were third , in the \u201c moderate \u201d section below Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula but above the Islamic State . Anarchists made the list again in 2019 , this time climbing to second , just below \u201c Homegrown Violent Extremists. \u201d They fell to third in 2020 , however , with \u201c White Supremacist Extremists \u201d finally cracking New Jersey \u2019 s top three after several centuries of organized terror and killing . \u2588\u2588\u2588 asked NJOHSP about its justification for considering anarchists a greater public safety threat than terror groups that have killed thousands of people , and whether the office has ever aided investigations into legal observers . The office said that it \u201c does not disclose operational or investigative details and sources. \u201d The government fusion centers that produce the kind of \u201c intelligence \u201d found in the BlueLeaks breach have been a problem for years , said Freddy Martinez , a policy analyst at Open the Government , a nonpartisan , nonprofit collective that works to peel back post-9/11 government secrecy through research and open records collection . Martinez was a lead author on a report published earlier this year detailing how the government \u2019 s billion-dollar network of fusion centers \u201c exhibit a persistent pattern of violating Americans \u2019 privacy and civil liberties , producing unreliable and ineffective information , and resisting financial and other types of standard public accountability. \u201d The BlueLeaks documents show that the problems with fusion centers go beyond efficiency , Martinez argued . \u201c It would be easy to say that the information is inaccurate , wrong , costly , which I think is true , but it also sort of describes what the priorities of the federal government are on counterterrorism , \u201d he said . \u201c The government is aware of what they \u2019 re doing . It \u2019 s a very intentional , \u2018 Well , we \u2019 re just going to criminalize dissent any way we can. \u2019 \u201d German , the former FBI agent , described how sensationalized , incomplete , or biased fusion center reporting can have a dangerous impact on the ground , particularly in complex , emotionally charged protest situations . \u201c I always try to read these and put myself in the shoes of a young police officer that doesn \u2019 t know anything about this subject , \u201d he said . \u201c All this tells me to do is be very afraid of these people and imagine the worst of anything that they do. \u201d \u201c You can kind of understand why their response is so aggressive and violent , \u201d he said . \u201c They \u2019 re scared to death , and they \u2019 re scared to death because there \u2019 s this echo chamber of right-wing media , White House statements and , unfortunately , law enforcement intelligence . \u201d\nIdentifying the Enemy As law enforcement worked to find cases that would support the attorney general \u2019 s portrait of a looming antifa menace , evidence mounted in late May and early June of right-wing extremists amassing weapons , plotting terror attacks , and killing law enforcement officials . In Denver , CAIC reported a police seizure of \u201c several military-style assault rifles from a vehicle occupied by a group of self-identified anti-government individuals who call themselves \u2018 Boogaloo Bois \u2019 \u201d near a protest on May 29 . The report , which began by noting that an anarchist blog had referred to police as \u201c pigs \u201d and included photos of anarchy \u201c A \u2019 s \u201d spray-painted on buildings , went on to list eight examples of far-right extremists across the country \u201c vigorously threatening violence towards recent protests , \u201d including sharing images of weapons stockpiles and tips on sabotaging police vehicles , neo-Nazis encouraging their brethren to \u201c dress up as law enforcement and film themselves attacking black people \u201d and calls to form small \u201c crews \u201d that would be \u201c willing to shed blood. \u201d Similar reports were filtering in from law enforcement in Minneapolis and Austin , Texas , where intelligence analysts released a bulletin advising law enforcement to be on the lookout for three young men in tactical gear who were detained \u201c in possession of two AR style rifles , one AK style rifle , two handguns , and several hundred rounds of ammunition , as well as gas masks. \u201d The men gave \u201c conflicting statements about where they had been and what they were doing in Austin , \u201d the Austin Regional Intelligence Center reported . \u201c Searches of social media show sympathetic views toward the Boogaloo Bois , an anti-government movement , as well as several other anti-police sentiments , \u201d the report stated , adding that one of the subject \u2019 s Facebook pages included a post that said he did not \u201c expect to be here next year \u201d and other comments suggesting that \u201c he may take action against \u201d law enforcement .\nOn June 4 , the U.S. military weighed in on the protests in the form of a report published by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service , which noted that federal prosecutors had \u201c charged three men connected with the boogaloo movement with terrorism offenses \u201d intended to \u201c spark violence \u201d at protests related to Floyd \u2019 s killing . Like Carrillo in California , all three of the men \u2014 Navy veteran Stephan Parshall , Army reservist Andrew Lynam , and Air Force veteran William Loomis \u2014 had ties to the U.S. military , NCIS noted , adding that it had published a \u201c Threat Awareness Message \u201d regarding the boogaloo movement earlier this year . \u201c Racially motivated violent extremist ( RMVE ) movements that subscribe to boogaloo have engaged in conceptual discussions about recruiting military or former military members for their perceived knowledge of combat training , \u201d the naval investigative agency stated . \u201c NCIS can not discount the possibility of DoD affiliated individuals sympathetic to or engaged in the boogaloo movement. \u201d A number of the details surrounding the Nevada arrests track with a longer history of militant , far-right extremism in the United States , said Kathleen Belew , a history professor at the University of Chicago and author of the book \u201c Bring the War Home : The White Power Movement and Paramilitary America. \u201d Prosecutors in the case allege that before setting their sights on a Black Lives Matter protest in Las Vegas , the three men discussed a potential attack targeting facilities at the Hoover Dam . According to Belew , the dam has been a target in the collective imagination of far-right extremists going back decades , including extremists linked to Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh . \u201c This goes way back , \u201d Belew told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c It \u2019 s not just that there \u2019 s a social movement that is attempting to kill cops and damage infrastructure targets and attack protesters \u2014 it \u2019 s that it \u2019 s a movement that has been trying to do this for decades , if not generations , and has largely gone unopposed by our courts , by our law enforcement , by our military , by our executives. \u201d The leaked documents charting law enforcement \u2019 s treatment of antifa versus groups like the boogaloo bois reflect a dangerous American impulse to draw equivalencies , Belew argued . \u201c Many reasonable people carry around with them as part of the way that we learn about how politics works this idea that there are two sides of everything , \u201d she said . \u201c This is a deeply ingrained belief in our culture , and there \u2019 s a historical set of reasons why we think about politics that way , but this is actually not a case where there are two sides of things that are the same . \u201d\nThe leaked documents charting law enforcement \u2019 s treatment of antifa versus groups like the boogaloo bois reflect a dangerous American impulse to draw equivalencies .\n\u201c This is a case where there is a long casualty list carried out by the white power movement , which has declared war against the country , \u201d she said . \u201c And there is , I think , a quite localized social movement of people who oppose it , but who have not attacked civilians , who have not attacked infrastructure , who have not attempted to overthrow the country. \u201d With a pandemic still raging , soaring unemployment , the most expansive civil rights protests in generations , and a coming presidential election , the nation is facing an interlocking set of problems that elevate the risk for far-right violence , Belew noted . \u201c We \u2019 re off the map in a number of ways , \u201d she said , and while historians are trained not to forecast the future , she added , \u201c I will say that as somebody who has been studying this for more than a decade , I \u2019 ve never been so worried. \u201d What \u2019 s particularly troubling , she argued , is that the historical archive shows a clear link between wars abroad and rising right-wing violence at home \u2014 Belew \u2019 s book charts that history from the Vietnam War through militia movements of the 1990s . With the country now having been at war for close to two decades , the question of blowback is not a matter of if , but when and how . \u201c This set of conditions is very , very troubling for people who are concerned about white power violence , \u201d Belew said . On June 6 , the FBI released another situation report detailing the state of protests across the country . Though Barr and Trump had pointed fingers at a shadowy network of leftist agitators pulling the protests \u2019 strings , the bureau continued to assess that the \u201c majority of the violence and vandalism \u201d appeared \u201c opportunistic \u201d in nature . With more than 13,600 arrests nationwide , the FBI reported that the Department of Justice had charged 70 individuals with federal crimes , most involving property damage and illegal activities that involved crossing state lines . The Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives had reported 81 burglaries involving the theft of guns , the FBI noted , leading to \u201c an estimated loss of 1,116 firearms , \u201d as well as \u201c 876 reported arsons \u201d and \u201c 76 explosive incidents . \u201d\nWhile the FBI report did note that both \u201c right wing and anarchist extremists \u201d could be involved in efforts to \u201c further ignite violence , \u201d it was again only antifa that was singled out by name . At one point , the FBI suggested that videos of law enforcement officers flashing the \u201c OK \u201d hand signal often used by white nationalists and the far right might actually be part of a left-wing plot to make police look bad . \u201c Some protestors and possible \u2018 ANTIFA \u2019 members attempted to bait law enforcement into displaying the \u2018 OK \u2019 hand sign , \u201d the FBI reported . \u201c These individuals plan to photograph the officers and use the photographs as propaganda to discredit the officers. \u201d With the election four months away , the Trump administration has pressed forward with a seemingly coordinated effort to link the nebulous antifa movement to acts of violence committed by the far right .\nOn June 26 , Fox News published an op-ed by Ken Cuccinelli , the acting deputy secretary of DHS , noting that Patrick Underwood , the federal court security officer gunned down in Oakland , was also a Black man whose life mattered . Cuccinelli suggested that his killing had been ignored because he was a member of law enforcement . As close trackers of the agency were quick to point out , Cuccinelli failed to mention that the man accused of killing Underwood has been linked to the boogaloo movement , which DHS leadership and the administration have been publicly quiet about . Cuccinelli , for his part , has been clear about the actors he sees as responsible for unrest in the country , tweeting on June 5 , while his own agency was raising internal alarms about the far right and Underwood \u2019 s family was still grieving , \u201c Their silence is deafening . Cities across America burn at the hands of antifa and anarchists while many political leaders are refusing to call it what it is : domestic terrorism. \u201d The same day Cuccinelli \u2019 s op-ed was published , Barr sent a memo to top Justice Department officials announcing the creation of a new \u201c Task Force on Violent Anti-Government Extremists. \u201d In the memo , the attorney general argued that both antifa and the boogaloo movement \u201c pose continuing threats to lawlessness. \u201d Appearing at a law enforcement roundtable in Arkansas last week , Barr said that more than 150 people have been hit with federal charges in relation to the recent protests . Joint Terrorism Task Forces , which partner FBI agents with state and local authorities , are currently pursuing more than 500 investigations , Barr added , targeting \u201c hardcore instigators. \u201d \u201c We are building up our intelligence on these instigators , \u201d Barr said , noting that the JTTFs , which were \u201c previously used really for self-radicalized Jihadi \u201d threats , are \u201c now focusing on groups like antifa and boogaloo bois and others that are involved in this activity. \u201d Shamsi said the Trump administration was using antifa as \u201c political bait. \u201d \u201c It is a very dangerous thing when the top law enforcement official unleashes the massive weight of vague and overbroad terrorism labels and authorities for surveillance and investigation for political purposes , \u201d she said . \u201c Unsurprisingly , given what we \u2019 ve been warning about for years , those authorities are being used in deeply problematic ways . It \u2019 s law enforcement agencies engaging in unjustified discriminatory investigations and bias-based profiling , which in turn generates inaccurate or unreliable information , which is then used by other federal , state and local agencies in a variety of contexts . That \u2019 s the problem with JTTFs and fusion centers and the post-911 infrastructure at its core. \u201d For all of the government \u2019 s talk of antifa , Mark Bray , a historian and author of the book \u201c Antifa : The Anti-Fascist Handbook , \u201d said he was less than impressed with the depth of the Trump administration \u2019 s research into the generations-old international struggle to combat fascism . \u201c What stood out to me is , among their sources , they have zero books , \u201d Bray told \u2588\u2588\u2588 , after reviewing fusion center documents from 2016 and 2017 aiming to explain antifa to law enforcement . \u201c Most of the research seems like someone who spent a weekend on Google , \u201d Bray said . It \u2019 s not difficult to see why an administration like Trump \u2019 s might zero in on antifa as a law enforcement target , Bray said . \u201c The fact that it \u2019 s this coalition politics of the radical left and that it does not have one specific united organization means that with some very rough reading of what antifa is , you can basically kind of paint the entire radical left as more or less antifa , and considering that there is a broad identification with the politics of anti-fascism beyond membership to a specific group , you can see how that could be useful , \u201d he said . \u201c I do think that that \u2019 s certainly part of the equation and was part of the motivation . \u201d",
    "content_original": "As protests against police violence spread to every state in the U.S. and dramatic images flooded in from cities across the country, President Donald Trump and his attorney general spun an ominous story of opportunistic leftists exploiting a national trauma to sow chaos and disorder. They were the anti-fascists known as \u201cantifa,\u201d and according to the administration they were domestic terrorists who would be policed accordingly. But while the White House beat the drum for a crackdown on a leaderless movement on the left, law enforcement offices across the country were sharing detailed reports of far-right extremists seeking to attack the protesters and police during the country\u2019s historic demonstrations, a trove of newly leaked documents reveals. Among the steady stream of threats from the far-right were repeated encounters between law enforcement and heavily armed adherents of the so-called boogaloo movement, which welcomes armed confrontation with cops as means to trigger civil war. With much of the U.S. policing apparatus on the hunt for antifa instigators, those violent aspirations appear to have materialized in a string of targeted attacks in California that left a federal protective services officer and a sheriff\u2019s deputy dead and several other law enforcement officials wounded. The cache of law enforcement materials was recently hacked and posted online under the title \u201cBlueLeaks,\u201d providing an unprecedented look at the communications between state, local, and federal law enforcement in the face of the nationwide protests. In an analysis of nearly 300 documents that reference \u201cantifa,\u201d The Intercept found repeated instances of antifa and left-wing protesting activities cast in cartoonishly grim terms alongside more substantive reports of lethal right-wing violence and threats that have received scant mention from top Trump administration officials. \u201cThroughout the documents you see counterterrorism agencies using extremism so broadly as to mean virtually anything that encompasses dissent,\u201d Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU\u2019s National Security Project, told The Intercept. \u201cThere are instances in which people engaging in white supremacist violence get the benefit of the doubt as potential lone offenders, while people of color and those who dissent against government injustice are smeared as threats with guilt by association.\u201d\n\nMichael German, a former FBI agent specializing in domestic terrorism and current fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, said the materials were rife with examples of law enforcement intelligence being politicized in ways that endangered both protesters and police alike. \u201cTerrorism is distinguished from other violence by its political nature and, as a result, counterterrorism is often highly politicized as well,\u201d German told The Intercept. \u201cHere we\u2019re seeing where this politicization of counterterrorism is being reflected in intelligence documents that are going out and are intended to inform state and local law enforcement on the ground.\u201d He added: \u201cOverall, what you see is a strange sensationalization of the antifa threats \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t exist when looking at the boogaloo documents.\u201d German argued that the impulse to paint both sides of the political spectrum with the same brush, despite the fact that only the far right is actively killing people, is among the most dangerous features of modern American law enforcement. In his review of the documents produced in response to the recent protests, German said purported \u201cthreats\u201d from antifa were routinely overblown, often framed vandalism as terrorism and were typically absent of concrete evidence of serious criminal activity. \u201cIt\u2019s chatter, it\u2019s \u2018intelligence reporting suggests,\u2019\u201d he said. On June 2, for example, the Department of Homeland Security circulated a tweet to law enforcement agencies across the country reporting that antifa was stashing bricks to \u201cfuel protests.\u201d The intelligence made its way to a law enforcement fusion center in Maine. Last week, Mainer magazine tracked down the original source of the tweet: a far-right, pro-Trump biker who goes by the name \u201cthe Wolfman,\u201d who claimed that Facebook kept deleting his brick-planting evidence \u201cbecause they are BLM supporters.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have these heavily armed groups right there, who have a much more direct and lengthy history of violence than anything antifa or anarchist-involved does.\u201d\n\nEven if antifa were staging bricks, German said, \u201cyou have these heavily armed groups right there, who have a much more direct and lengthy history of violence than anything antifa or anarchist-involved does.\u201d Unlike the information circulated about antifa, much of the intelligence reporting in the BlueLeaks documents regarding threats from the far right is tightly focused on specific events, German noted. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it should be,\u201d he said. Far-right extremists have been targeting and killing law enforcement, not to mention members of the general public, for generations, German explained, and in fact, the government\u2019s own documents show that those ideas were percolating in extremist corners of the right at the same time that Trump and U.S. Attorney General William Barr were preparing to crack down on the left. While antifa has been a right-wing boogeyman for years, the administration\u2019s rhetoric ramped up in late May, with Trump tweeting that he would designate the movement as a terrorist organization. Barr followed the tweet with a Department of Justice statement reporting that federal investigators would work to \u201cidentify criminal organizers and instigators\u201d who were \u201chijacking\u201d the protests, and warning that \u201cthe violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.\u201d In the weeks since Barr\u2019s statement was issued, The Intercept has published accounts of FBI agents in multiple states targeting individuals with a perceived relationship to antifa for interviews and potential informant work. Meanwhile, the Trump Make America Great Again Committee, an official fundraising arm of the president, has been running campaign ads urging donors to send money to show support for the administration\u2019s antifa enforcement campaign. Yet the leaked materials show that on May 29, two days before Trump tweeted that antifa would be labeled a terrorist organization and Barr issued his DOJ statement, the president\u2019s own DHS analysts issued an open source intelligence report detailing how a white supremacist channel on Telegram, an encrypted messaging service, was encouraging followers to capitalize on the unrest by targeting the police with Molotov cocktails and firearms. \u201cThe use of firearms greatly influences the scale and intensity of these events,\u201d a source in the group, titled \u201cNational Accelerationist Revival,\u201d wrote on May 27, advising followers to break police lines \u201cwith cocktails, chainsaws, and firearms.\u201d At the time, DHS reported, the group included more than 3,400 subscribers. \u201cLooting and shoplifting are both cool and whites should be doing it way more,\u201d the source went on. \u201cWhen the laws no longer benefit you, break them for personal gain. If you don\u2019t feel like buying something, steal it. If you don\u2019t feel like driving slow, drive fast. If you don\u2019t like someone, hurt them.\u201d \u201cWe ought to revel in the destruction of the police state,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIt is just as necessary to break down the police state and the system of control as it is to spread racial hatred.\u201d\n\nIn a separate document disseminated the following day, DHS warned its workforce that the nation\u2019s \u201cperiod of darkness\u201d would soon worsen, as \u201cviolent protest movements\u201d grew. Domestic extremists would capitalize on the unrest to \u201ctake over government facilities and attack law enforcement,\u201d DHS predicted, with protests following police killings of civilians \u201cposing a high risk of escalating to both premeditated and random attacks targeting law enforcement officers nationwide.\u201d The document went on to describe how \u201cusers of a white supremacist extremist Telegram channel attempted to incite followers to engage in violence and start the \u2018boogaloo\u2019 \u2014 a term used by some violent extremists to refer to the start of a second Civil War \u2014 by shooting in a crowd.\u201d Among the developments cited in the bulletin was the May 29 assassination of a federal court security guard in Oakland. The alleged perpetrator would later be identified as Steven Carrillo, a 32-year-old sergeant in an elite Air Force security unit. According to authorities, Carrillo would go on to ambush and kill a sheriff\u2019s deputy and wound several others in a second targeted attack days later. In court filings last month, the FBI reported that the airman had a ballistics vest bearing a boogaloo patch. Following a shootout with police, Carrillo reportedly used his own blood to scrawl phrases associated with the movement on the hood of a vehicle he had carjacked. In the run-up to the initial attack, federal authorities said Carrillo made several comments in a Facebook group with his accused accomplices arguing that the protests were an ideal opportunity to kill law enforcement \u2014 whom he referred to as \u201csoup bois,\u201d a reference to the \u201calphabet soup\u201d of law enforcement titles \u2014 and kick off a broader nationwide conflagration. \u201cGo to the riots and support our own cause,\u201d Carrillo reportedly wrote on the morning of the attacks. \u201cShow them the real targets. Use their anger to fuel our fire. Think outside the box. We have mobs of angry people to use to our advantage.\u201d At approximately 9:44 p.m, Carrillo and his accused partner, Robert Alvin Justus Jr., rolled up in a white van outside the Ronald V. Dellums Federal Building. The side door of the vehicle slid open and Carrillo opened fire. Fifty-three-year-old David Patrick Underwood was shot dead. His partner was wounded. \u201cDid you see how they fucking fell?\u201d Justus would later recall Carrillo exclaiming, as the van took off into the night.\n\nCalifornia Highway Patrol officers keep a road closed in Ben Lomond near Santa Cruz, Calif., on June 8, 2020, as FBI agents continue processing the scene where Santa Cruz County Sheriff\u2019s Sgt. Damon Gutzwiller was killed by Staff Sgt. Steven Carrillo. Photo: Shmuel Thaler/The Santa Cruz Sentinel via AP\n\nWhile Carrillo was on the run in California, the FBI\u2019s Minneapolis office circulated uncorroborated \u201conline discussions\u201d between unidentified individuals indicating that \u201cAntifa wanted to \u2018massacre\u2019 National Guard personnel at the Minnesota State Capitol\u201d in an unprecedented vehicle-born explosive attack. In the June 1 report, the bureau\u2019s Minneapolis office noted that the intelligence coming in was based on photos of National Guard vehicles that did not appear to come from Minnesota, that it was the product of an outside office, and that \u201cgiven current circumstances in the Twin Cities, the FBI Minneapolis Field Office cautions that the source may have potentially provided intelligence to influence recipients.\u201d That same morning, Trump tweeted a quote from \u201cFox and Friends\u201d co-host Brian Kilmeade: \u201cI don\u2019t see any indication that there were any white supremist [sic] groups mixing in. This is an ANTIFA Organization. It seems that the first time we saw it in a major way was Occupy Wall Street. It\u2019s the same mindset.\u201d The president endorsed Kilmeade\u2019s assessment, writing in all caps, \u201cTRUE!\u201d Later in the day, Trump appeared in the Rose Garden of the White House to announce that he would mobilize military forces to quash \u201cthe violence and restore security and safety in America.\u201d The president was quick to point out the role of \u201cprofessional anarchists, violent mobs \u2026 arsonists, looters, criminals, rider rioters, Antifa, and others\u201d in creating unrest. \u201cA federal officer in California, an African American enforcement hero, was shot and killed,\u201d he said, referring to Underwood and the targeted attack in Oakland.\n\nTrump made no mention of groups on the far right. Behind the scenes, however, DHS was acknowledging \u201cmedia reports\u201d indicating \u201cthat neo-Nazi, and other paramilitary far-right groups, are calling for terror attacks during the ongoing unrest throughout the United States.\u201d \u201cA series of Telegram accounts linked to a wider network of paramilitary far-right extremists have indicated that ongoing disturbances are spreading America\u2019s police forces thin, making this the ideal time to strike with a strategic attack,\u201d the agency reported in a round-up of intelligence reports coming in from around the country, published the following morning. \u201cOne account, with thousands of followers and links to several neo-Nazi terror groups like The Base and the Nordic Resistance Movement, called for attacks on critical infrastructure.\u201d The agency noted that Twitter had recently removed a fake antifa account \u201ccreated by a known white supremacist group\u201d that had issued a call to violence. \u201cAlthough the account only had a few hundred followers, it is an example of white supremacists seeking to inflame tensions in the United States,\u201d DHS reported. According to a distribution list at the bottom of the report, the document was shared with the White House Situation Room, DHS headquarters, federal interagency operations centers, and state and local partners. The Intercept sent detailed lists of questions regarding documents in the BlueLeaks trove to the White House, the Department of Justice, and DHS. None responded. The FBI referred The Intercept to an interview director Christopher Wray gave to Fox News in a late June, in which he appeared to distance the bureau from the more strident antifa rhetoric of Barr and Trump. \u201cOur efforts are focused on identifying, investigating, and disrupting individuals that are inciting violence and engaging in criminal activity,\u201d the bureau said in a statement. \u201cWe are not focused on peaceful protests.\u201c An Antifa Obsession Despite the apparent stream of intelligence indicating that the far right was looking to use the protests as cover to attack law enforcement and create disorder, the FBI, by June 2, was still uncertain whether the attack in Oakland was linked to the demonstrations. \u201cAt this time, the FBI is unable to determine if this incident is related to the civil unrest in the Oakland area,\u201d the bureau noted in a lengthy situation report. Carrillo\u2019s arrest was still four days away. On the heels of Barr\u2019s antifa statement, the FBI noted that its field offices had been \u201cencouraged to canvass sources for intelligence associated with violent or illegal extremist activity.\u201d The bureau added that \u201cany attempts by law enforcement to arrest individuals\u201d openly carrying guns at protests, as well as increased use of the National Guard, was likely to draw more anti-government militias into the streets. The 16-page FBI report did not mention the boogaloo movement nor any of the many other domestic extremist groups of the American far right, by name. It did, however, highlight antifa and anarchists more than a half dozen times.\n\nIn Newark, New Jersey, police and FBI investigators had identified \u201ca probable \u2018Antifa\u2019 related individual,\u201d who was arrested for possessing a knife, a hatchet, and a jar of gasoline. Though the man\u2019s charge was unclear, the FBI reported that it had \u201cobtained one of his Facebook posts which contained a video of him at the riots inciting others to steal from the stores while he stood guard.\u201d With the man having described himself as \u201canti-government and anti-authority,\u201d the FBI reported that its Newark office \u201cbelieves this profile is consistent with \u2018Antifa.\u2019\u201d While agents were investigating the man in Newark, the FBI\u2019s field office in Spokane, Washington, was looking into an \u201cantifa group\u201d reportedly headed through Idaho and on to Minneapolis. In Denver, meanwhile, the FBI was investigating the alleged transfer of \u201criot supplies\u201d to \u201cantifa members,\u201d and in Philadelphia, authorities were \u201cattempting to confirm if any of the individuals arrested by Philadelphia Police Department have \u2018Antifa\u2019 affiliations.\u201d The portrait the FBI painted of the country was chaotic, with nearly three dozen FBI SWAT teams in various stages of deployment nationwide. The report noted \u201cmultiple officer related shootings\u201d in the 12 hours preceding its dissemination, including the killing of a police officer in Las Vegas and an \u201cassailant\u201d who allegedly fired on police officers and a National Guard patrol in Kentucky. Nearly 200 pistols and rifles had been stolen from locations in San Francisco and Albuquerque, New Mexico, the FBI reported; it was unclear by whom. While a variety of groups had been linked to the unrest, the FBI noted that \u201cmuch of the violence and vandalism is perpetrated by opportunistic, individual actors acting without specific direction.\u201d Nonetheless, the bureau would \u201ccontinue to aggressively \u2026 seek to corroborate whether or not there is in fact an organized effort to incite violence by either known criminal groups or domestic violent extremists,\u201d which apparently included running down \u201cuncorroborated intelligence about alleged participation of Venezuelan and Nicaraguan socialist groups.\u201d According to the report, with more than 4,000 arrests across the country, the FBI had tagged nearly 200 incidents as \u201criot related threats\u201d and was in the process of investigating 40 \u201ccases associated with violent protests.\u201d With Trump hyping antifa hysteria in Washington, D.C., reports of lurking leftists began cropping around the country. In Colorado, a Denver resident reported that they had followed a \u201csuspicious person\u201d into their apartment complex who looked to be attempting to set the building on fire. \u201cFairly certain he was a member of an Antifa like group,\u201d the resident wrote, adding that there were \u201ctwo Antifa safe houses on our block.\u201d \u201cI know this because they have been walking past our house telling us they can offer shelter, food, supplies, etc. also they have been hiding on our stoop when Swat drives by and they keep discussing their plans and where they are going. They have a central phone # they are calling to get updates and where they need to go to,\u201d the resident said. \u201cPlease nip this shit in the ass. This is the second time in two days we had someone attempt to burn down our apartment building/neighboring buildings. Get these terrorists out of our city please!\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease nip this shit in the ass. This is the second time in two days we had someone attempt to burn down our apartment building/neighboring buildings. Get these terrorists out of our city please!\u201d\n\nThe Colorado Information Analysis Center, a law enforcement fusion center, listed the type of activity described in the complaint as \u201cterrorism.\u201d CIAC did not respond to a request for comment for this story. It wasn\u2019t just residents worried about antifa. CIAC also received a request from the Douglas County Sheriff\u2019s Department seeking \u201cinformation on ANTIFA, and possibility of acts targeting our AOR\u201d \u2014 area of operations. In neighboring Nebraska, the FBI\u2019s Omaha office was running down information indicating that an \u201cunidentified individual who claimed to be a member of ANTIFA\u201d had posted a Craigslist ad offering to \u201cpay up to 1,000 individuals $25 per hour to \u2018cause as much chaos and destruction as possible\u2019\u201d in \u201cnightly violent protests.\u201d In Virginia, the FBI warned that black lines spray-painted on federal buildings was a sign of antifa vandalism to come. All over the country, from California to Texas to West Virginia, law enforcement was chasing antifa leads and looking to hunt down instigators. The BlueLeaks documents suggest a borderline obsession on the part of some law enforcement offices with painting antifa, anarchists, and left-wing dissent more broadly as a serious terrorist threat. In early June, New Jersey\u2019s Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness (NJOHSP) issued a two-page report detailing how legal observers with the National Lawyers Guild, a progressive association of attorneys and legal advocates that has been around since the 1930s and sends representatives to public protests to monitor police activity, were in fact \u201can anarchist extremist subgroup.\u201d \u201c\u2018Lawyers\u2019 may be identified by their bright neon green hats or clothing; however, these individual [sic] may or may not be licensed lawyers,\u201d the office warned. \u201cTheir role is to record information regarding the interactions Antifa members are having during an arrest. This individual will record the interaction with the aid of another member, while noting information. The \u2018lawyer\u2019 will also obtain booking information and are known to argue with police over arrests and interactions.\u201d Anti-fascists were bent on infiltrating protests over the killing of George Floyd by Minnesota police Officer Derek Chauvin \u201cto further their violent ideology,\u201d the New Jersey office reported, and \u201ccontinue to attack government institutions; use violent counter-protest tactics against adversarial groups, including law enforcement; and target political figures representing disparate views.\u201d This was not the first time the New Jersey\u2019s homeland security office had set its sights on leftists. In a 2018 report, the office compiled a color-coded chart of the biggest terror threats to New Jersey. Anarchist extremists were third, in the \u201cmoderate\u201d section below Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula but above the Islamic State. Anarchists made the list again in 2019, this time climbing to second, just below \u201cHomegrown Violent Extremists.\u201d They fell to third in 2020, however, with \u201cWhite Supremacist Extremists\u201d finally cracking New Jersey\u2019s top three after several centuries of organized terror and killing. The Intercept asked NJOHSP about its justification for considering anarchists a greater public safety threat than terror groups that have killed thousands of people, and whether the office has ever aided investigations into legal observers. The office said that it \u201cdoes not disclose operational or investigative details and sources.\u201d The government fusion centers that produce the kind of \u201cintelligence\u201d found in the BlueLeaks breach have been a problem for years, said Freddy Martinez, a policy analyst at Open the Government, a nonpartisan, nonprofit collective that works to peel back post-9/11 government secrecy through research and open records collection. Martinez was a lead author on a report published earlier this year detailing how the government\u2019s billion-dollar network of fusion centers \u201cexhibit a persistent pattern of violating Americans\u2019 privacy and civil liberties, producing unreliable and ineffective information, and resisting financial and other types of standard public accountability.\u201d The BlueLeaks documents show that the problems with fusion centers go beyond efficiency, Martinez argued. \u201cIt would be easy to say that the information is inaccurate, wrong, costly, which I think is true, but it also sort of describes what the priorities of the federal government are on counterterrorism,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government is aware of what they\u2019re doing. It\u2019s a very intentional, \u2018Well, we\u2019re just going to criminalize dissent any way we can.\u2019\u201d German, the former FBI agent, described how sensationalized, incomplete, or biased fusion center reporting can have a dangerous impact on the ground, particularly in complex, emotionally charged protest situations. \u201cI always try to read these and put myself in the shoes of a young police officer that doesn\u2019t know anything about this subject,\u201d he said. \u201cAll this tells me to do is be very afraid of these people and imagine the worst of anything that they do.\u201d \u201cYou can kind of understand why their response is so aggressive and violent,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re scared to death, and they\u2019re scared to death because there\u2019s this echo chamber of right-wing media, White House statements and, unfortunately, law enforcement intelligence.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Doug Mills-Pool/Getty Images\n\nIdentifying the Enemy As law enforcement worked to find cases that would support the attorney general\u2019s portrait of a looming antifa menace, evidence mounted in late May and early June of right-wing extremists amassing weapons, plotting terror attacks, and killing law enforcement officials. In Denver, CAIC reported a police seizure of \u201cseveral military-style assault rifles from a vehicle occupied by a group of self-identified anti-government individuals who call themselves \u2018Boogaloo Bois\u2019\u201d near a protest on May 29. The report, which began by noting that an anarchist blog had referred to police as \u201cpigs\u201d and included photos of anarchy \u201cA\u2019s\u201d spray-painted on buildings, went on to list eight examples of far-right extremists across the country \u201cvigorously threatening violence towards recent protests,\u201d including sharing images of weapons stockpiles and tips on sabotaging police vehicles, neo-Nazis encouraging their brethren to \u201cdress up as law enforcement and film themselves attacking black people\u201d and calls to form small \u201ccrews\u201d that would be \u201cwilling to shed blood.\u201d Similar reports were filtering in from law enforcement in Minneapolis and Austin, Texas, where intelligence analysts released a bulletin advising law enforcement to be on the lookout for three young men in tactical gear who were detained \u201cin possession of two AR style rifles, one AK style rifle, two handguns, and several hundred rounds of ammunition, as well as gas masks.\u201d The men gave \u201cconflicting statements about where they had been and what they were doing in Austin,\u201d the Austin Regional Intelligence Center reported. \u201cSearches of social media show sympathetic views toward the Boogaloo Bois, an anti-government movement, as well as several other anti-police sentiments,\u201d the report stated, adding that one of the subject\u2019s Facebook pages included a post that said he did not \u201cexpect to be here next year\u201d and other comments suggesting that \u201che may take action against\u201d law enforcement.\n\nOn June 4, the U.S. military weighed in on the protests in the form of a report published by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, which noted that federal prosecutors had \u201ccharged three men connected with the boogaloo movement with terrorism offenses\u201d intended to \u201cspark violence\u201d at protests related to Floyd\u2019s killing. Like Carrillo in California, all three of the men \u2014 Navy veteran Stephan Parshall, Army reservist Andrew Lynam, and Air Force veteran William Loomis \u2014 had ties to the U.S. military, NCIS noted, adding that it had published a \u201cThreat Awareness Message\u201d regarding the boogaloo movement earlier this year. \u201cRacially motivated violent extremist (RMVE) movements that subscribe to boogaloo have engaged in conceptual discussions about recruiting military or former military members for their perceived knowledge of combat training,\u201d the naval investigative agency stated. \u201cNCIS cannot discount the possibility of DoD affiliated individuals sympathetic to or engaged in the boogaloo movement.\u201d A number of the details surrounding the Nevada arrests track with a longer history of militant, far-right extremism in the United States, said Kathleen Belew, a history professor at the University of Chicago and author of the book \u201cBring the War Home: The White Power Movement and Paramilitary America.\u201d Prosecutors in the case allege that before setting their sights on a Black Lives Matter protest in Las Vegas, the three men discussed a potential attack targeting facilities at the Hoover Dam. According to Belew, the dam has been a target in the collective imagination of far-right extremists going back decades, including extremists linked to Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh. \u201cThis goes way back,\u201d Belew told The Intercept. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that there\u2019s a social movement that is attempting to kill cops and damage infrastructure targets and attack protesters \u2014 it\u2019s that it\u2019s a movement that has been trying to do this for decades, if not generations, and has largely gone unopposed by our courts, by our law enforcement, by our military, by our executives.\u201d The leaked documents charting law enforcement\u2019s treatment of antifa versus groups like the boogaloo bois reflect a dangerous American impulse to draw equivalencies, Belew argued. \u201cMany reasonable people carry around with them as part of the way that we learn about how politics works this idea that there are two sides of everything,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a deeply ingrained belief in our culture, and there\u2019s a historical set of reasons why we think about politics that way, but this is actually not a case where there are two sides of things that are the same.\u201d\n\nThe leaked documents charting law enforcement\u2019s treatment of antifa versus groups like the boogaloo bois reflect a dangerous American impulse to draw equivalencies.\n\n\u201cThis is a case where there is a long casualty list carried out by the white power movement, which has declared war against the country,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd there is, I think, a quite localized social movement of people who oppose it, but who have not attacked civilians, who have not attacked infrastructure, who have not attempted to overthrow the country.\u201d With a pandemic still raging, soaring unemployment, the most expansive civil rights protests in generations, and a coming presidential election, the nation is facing an interlocking set of problems that elevate the risk for far-right violence, Belew noted. \u201cWe\u2019re off the map in a number of ways,\u201d she said, and while historians are trained not to forecast the future, she added, \u201cI will say that as somebody who has been studying this for more than a decade, I\u2019ve never been so worried.\u201d What\u2019s particularly troubling, she argued, is that the historical archive shows a clear link between wars abroad and rising right-wing violence at home \u2014 Belew\u2019s book charts that history from the Vietnam War through militia movements of the 1990s. With the country now having been at war for close to two decades, the question of blowback is not a matter of if, but when and how. \u201cThis set of conditions is very, very troubling for people who are concerned about white power violence,\u201d Belew said. On June 6, the FBI released another situation report detailing the state of protests across the country. Though Barr and Trump had pointed fingers at a shadowy network of leftist agitators pulling the protests\u2019 strings, the bureau continued to assess that the \u201cmajority of the violence and vandalism\u201d appeared \u201copportunistic\u201d in nature. With more than 13,600 arrests nationwide, the FBI reported that the Department of Justice had charged 70 individuals with federal crimes, most involving property damage and illegal activities that involved crossing state lines. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had reported 81 burglaries involving the theft of guns, the FBI noted, leading to \u201can estimated loss of 1,116 firearms,\u201d as well as \u201c876 reported arsons\u201d and \u201c76 explosive incidents.\u201d\n\nWhile the FBI report did note that both \u201cright wing and anarchist extremists\u201d could be involved in efforts to \u201cfurther ignite violence,\u201d it was again only antifa that was singled out by name. At one point, the FBI suggested that videos of law enforcement officers flashing the \u201cOK\u201d hand signal often used by white nationalists and the far right might actually be part of a left-wing plot to make police look bad. \u201cSome protestors and possible \u2018ANTIFA\u2019 members attempted to bait law enforcement into displaying the \u2018OK\u2019 hand sign,\u201d the FBI reported. \u201cThese individuals plan to photograph the officers and use the photographs as propaganda to discredit the officers.\u201d With the election four months away, the Trump administration has pressed forward with a seemingly coordinated effort to link the nebulous antifa movement to acts of violence committed by the far right.\n\nMourners view the body of Federal Protective Services Officer Dave Patrick Underwood after a memorial service on June 19, 2020, in Pinole, Calif. Photo: Ben Margot/AP\n\nOn June 26, Fox News published an op-ed by Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary of DHS, noting that Patrick Underwood, the federal court security officer gunned down in Oakland, was also a Black man whose life mattered. Cuccinelli suggested that his killing had been ignored because he was a member of law enforcement. As close trackers of the agency were quick to point out, Cuccinelli failed to mention that the man accused of killing Underwood has been linked to the boogaloo movement, which DHS leadership and the administration have been publicly quiet about. Cuccinelli, for his part, has been clear about the actors he sees as responsible for unrest in the country, tweeting on June 5, while his own agency was raising internal alarms about the far right and Underwood\u2019s family was still grieving, \u201cTheir silence is deafening. Cities across America burn at the hands of antifa and anarchists while many political leaders are refusing to call it what it is: domestic terrorism.\u201d The same day Cuccinelli\u2019s op-ed was published, Barr sent a memo to top Justice Department officials announcing the creation of a new \u201cTask Force on Violent Anti-Government Extremists.\u201d In the memo, the attorney general argued that both antifa and the boogaloo movement \u201cpose continuing threats to lawlessness.\u201d Appearing at a law enforcement roundtable in Arkansas last week, Barr said that more than 150 people have been hit with federal charges in relation to the recent protests. Joint Terrorism Task Forces, which partner FBI agents with state and local authorities, are currently pursuing more than 500 investigations, Barr added, targeting \u201chardcore instigators.\u201d \u201cWe are building up our intelligence on these instigators,\u201d Barr said, noting that the JTTFs, which were \u201cpreviously used really for self-radicalized Jihadi\u201d threats, are \u201cnow focusing on groups like antifa and boogaloo bois and others that are involved in this activity.\u201d Shamsi said the Trump administration was using antifa as \u201cpolitical bait.\u201d \u201cIt is a very dangerous thing when the top law enforcement official unleashes the massive weight of vague and overbroad terrorism labels and authorities for surveillance and investigation for political purposes,\u201d she said. \u201cUnsurprisingly, given what we\u2019ve been warning about for years, those authorities are being used in deeply problematic ways. It\u2019s law enforcement agencies engaging in unjustified discriminatory investigations and bias-based profiling, which in turn generates inaccurate or unreliable information, which is then used by other federal, state and local agencies in a variety of contexts. That\u2019s the problem with JTTFs and fusion centers and the post-911 infrastructure at its core.\u201d For all of the government\u2019s talk of antifa, Mark Bray, a historian and author of the book \u201cAntifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,\u201d said he was less than impressed with the depth of the Trump administration\u2019s research into the generations-old international struggle to combat fascism. \u201cWhat stood out to me is, among their sources, they have zero books,\u201d Bray told The Intercept, after reviewing fusion center documents from 2016 and 2017 aiming to explain antifa to law enforcement. \u201cMost of the research seems like someone who spent a weekend on Google,\u201d Bray said. It\u2019s not difficult to see why an administration like Trump\u2019s might zero in on antifa as a law enforcement target, Bray said. \u201cThe fact that it\u2019s this coalition politics of the radical left and that it does not have one specific united organization means that with some very rough reading of what antifa is, you can basically kind of paint the entire radical left as more or less antifa, and considering that there is a broad identification with the politics of anti-fascism beyond membership to a specific group, you can see how that could be useful,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think that that\u2019s certainly part of the equation and was part of the motivation.\u201d",
