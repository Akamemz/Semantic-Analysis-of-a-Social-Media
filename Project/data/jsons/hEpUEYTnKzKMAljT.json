    "content": "One of the biggest mysteries about the long con of Donald Trump 's presidential campaign is how he has convinced millions of middle-class white Americans that he truly gives a shit about them . How can it be , I \u2019 ve often wondered , that a billionaire who lives in a pink-marble triplex high above Fifth Avenue , one who flies around in his own aging Boeing 757 and who owns a weekend home in Palm Beach and property in New Jersey horse country , can somehow become the hero of the people left in the wake of the new digital economy ? These voters , indeed , have every right to wonder what happened to their American dream . They have every right to be worried about their livelihood and their future . They have every right to be equally terrified and aggrieved about the slow growth of the real economy , and how it has made the life that we have come to expect for generations all but unattainable .\nTrump , of course , has never quite evidenced sympathy for the common man . According to a recent bombshell report in The Washington Post , in fact , we now know that Trump \u2019 s own foundation reportedly spent $ 20,000 to purchase a six-foot portrait of Trump himself . Perhaps Trump \u2019 s appeal to the Rust Belt results , in part , from the fact that he is a former television star , who showed up in our living rooms every week in a fictitious corporate boardroom . Sara Flynn , a 55-year-old mother of four sons in Hebron , Kentucky , recently explained to reporters from The New York Times that she has liked Trump ever since she watched him on The Apprentice . She said that she believes Trump when he says he can \u201c make America great again. \u201d She seemed wistful . \u201c That \u2019 s a bygone era , that \u2019 s when America was great , \u201d she said of the old days . \u201c It hasn \u2019 t been like that for me . \u201d\nI suspect part of the reason that Flynn and others like her feel an affinity for Trump is because of the promises he makes in his speeches , like the one he gave on Thursday to the Economic Club of New York , at the Waldorf Astoria hotel , which is now owned by a Chinese insurance company . The speech was likely written by one of the Reagan-era economic disciples who whisper in Trump \u2019 s ears these days . Maybe it was Larry Kudlow , the ex\u2013Bear Stearns economist and CNBC veteran ( he was on the dais over Trump \u2019 s right shoulder ) ? Or maybe it was Stephen Moore , formerly a columnist at The Wall Street Journal , who is now a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation ? Trump \u2019 s words certainly sounded a bit like Reagan \u2019 s . Fresh from his two-hour photo-op in Flint , Michigan , the day before , he told the invitation-only crowd in New York , \u201c It used to be cars were made in Flint , and you couldn \u2019 t drink the water in Mexico . Now , the cars are made in Mexico and you can \u2019 t drink the water in Flint . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s a good line , and Trump presumably knew it . He had , in fact , also used it in Flint the day before . Like some of what Trump says , it is funny . But like much of what he says , it is n't true . We make millions of cars , and car parts , in America . A recent study by the Center for Automotive Research , in fact , revealed that the auto industry accounts for about 3 percent , or nearly $ 75 billion , of all foreign direct investment in the United States .\nBut Trump \u2019 s brand depends upon fever dreams more than realities . Trump laid the promises on thick at the Waldorf . \u201c We are going to turn this around , \u201d he continued . \u201c My economic plan rejects the cynicism that says our labor force will keep declining , that our jobs will keep leaving , and that our economy can never grow as it did once before . We reject the pessimism that says our standard of living can no longer rise , and that all that \u2019 s left to do is divide up and redistribute our shrinking resources .
