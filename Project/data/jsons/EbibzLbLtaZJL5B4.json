The very fact that many of the world \u2019 s poorest countries are already immunizing against a number of diseases , including measles , and that `` middle income '' countries are providing a growing spectrum of vaccines without any donor support at all , is a demonstration of the level of global commitment against infectious disease that should shame America .\nAverage health expenditures per person per year\u2014public and private combined\u2014are as low as $ 20 in some of the poorest countries that receive Gavi support and remain below $ 100 in such countries as Nigeria and India .
