Muilenberg stepped down immediately , and Chairman David Calhoun , 62 , will become CEO on Jan. 13 . Boeing declined to comment on Muilenburg 's severance , but a filing earlier this year showed he could be eligible for around $ 39 million . The shakeup comes as Boeing has flailed in its attempts to contain one of the biggest crises in its more than 100-year history , disrupting relationships with the very airline customers that fueled Boeing 's sales boom in recent years to the pilots who have complained about broken trust . Airlines have lost millions of dollars in revenue and have curbed their growth without access to the fuel efficient planes , which regulators grounded in mid-March . Earlier this month , the Federal Aviation Administration took the rare step of publicly admonishing Boeing for pushing an unrealistic timeline for the planes ' return to service and for appearing to pressure the regulator . The two crashes \u2014 in Indonesia in October 2018 and in Ethiopia last March \u2014 claimed 346 lives . A flight-control program has been implicated in both crashes , and regulators have n't yet signed off on software changes for the planes , forcing airlines to rejigger their schedules well into 2020 .\nWhat did Muilenburg in was repeated claims that regulators would return the plane to service in the fourth quarter and a dressing down in Washington by FAA administrator Steve Dickson , according to people familiar with the matter .
