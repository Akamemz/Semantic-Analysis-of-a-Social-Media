But their fate when the full Senate considers them , probably in April , is less certain . The trafficking measure by Leahy , D-Vt. , was thought to have the best prospects , while the assault weapons ban by Sen.

Charles Schumer , D-N.Y. , had hoped to reach a bipartisan deal on expanding federal background checks with conservative Sen. Tom Coburn , R-Okla . But on Wednesday , Democrats set aside their efforts to win over Coburn after weeks of talks failed to resolve a dispute over requiring that records of private sales be retained .\nTheir inability to craft a deal with Coburn was a blow to Democrats because of his solid conservative credentials and `` A '' rating with the NRA . His support could have meant backing from other Senate Republicans and even moderate Democrats , including several facing 2014 re-election campaigns in GOP-leaning states .\nIn addition , supporters of curbing guns say the Senate will have to approve legislation with strong bipartisan support to boost their chances of success in the GOP-led House .
