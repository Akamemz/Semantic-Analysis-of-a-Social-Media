    "content": "The Supreme Court ruled Monday in favor of a Colorado baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple , in one of the most closely watched cases of the term .\nIn a 7-2 decision , the justices set aside a Colorado court ruling against the baker -- while stopping short of deciding the broader issue of whether a business can refuse to serve gay and lesbian people . The opinion was penned by Justice Anthony Kennedy , who is often the swing justice in tight cases .\nThe narrow ruling here focused on what the court described as anti-religious bias on the Colorado Civil Rights Commission when it ruled against baker Jack Phillips .\n`` The Commission \u2019 s hostility was inconsistent with the First Amendment \u2019 s guarantee that our laws be applied in a manner that is neutral toward religion , '' Kennedy wrote in his majority opinion .\nAttorney Michael Farris , president of the Alliance Defending Freedom which represented the baker , told Fox News that Phillips is \u201c ecstatic \u201d at the decision .\n\u201c Justice Kennedy has held that tolerance is a two-way street , and Jack Phillips was not tolerated by the Civil Rights Commission of Colorado , \u201d he said .\nThe court said the broader issue , though , `` must await further elaboration .
