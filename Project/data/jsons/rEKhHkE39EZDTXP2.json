    "content": "One of the world \u2019 s most popular podcasters has said that he \u2019 ll \u201c probably vote for Bernie Sanders. \u201d He went on to say some glowing things about Senator Sanders \u2019 s consistency and integrity . Unsurprisingly , the Sanders campaign celebrated the moment by tweeting out the clip . Why wouldn \u2019 t it ? While Sanders , Tulsi Gabbard , and Andrew Yang have appeared on the Joe Rogan Experience , Rogan has said that Warren , Buttigieg , and Biden have all tried and failed to get booked on the show . It \u2019 s obvious why \u2014 the YouTube page for The Joe Rogan Experience has 7.29 million subscribers , and even more people download the podcast every month . Better yet , this legion of fans isn \u2019 t made up of progressive activists who were already planning to vote in the Democratic primaries . Rogan spends far more time talking about drugs and movies and Mixed Martial Arts than he does about the presidential election . Many of his fans are relatively apolitical , but some may be moved to register to vote by Rogan \u2019 s ode to the integrity of Bernie Sanders \u2014 or his passionate defense of Medicare for All . Of course , there \u2019 s a reason why Rogan is controversial . When he does talk politics , the host often does so in the context of chatting with \u201c intellectual dark web \u201d figures like Jordan Peterson and Dave Rubin about culture war issues like free speech on college campuses . Rogan \u2019 s friendly relationship with these right-wing thinkers , along with his own reactionary views , has given many casual observers the impression that he \u2019 s a coherent right-winger . In reality , he \u2019 s about where many persuadable Americans are , which is to say that while he doesn \u2019 t think about politics all the time , he likes and dislikes some individual politicians , he has kneejerk reactionary positions on some issues , and he finds egalitarian proposals for universal programs deeply appealing . The fact that the Sanders campaign can reach the Joe Rogans of the world is a very good thing .\nThe Controversy However , more than a few progressives , appalled at some of Rogan \u2019 s statements over the years and his associations , thought that the campaign should repudiate the endorsement \u2014 or at least that it was wrong for Bernie \u2019 s social media team to tweet out the clip . We disagree , but not because we don \u2019 t think the criticisms of Rogan are baseless . The \u201c intellectual dark web \u201d figures , for example , that Rogan promotes play a corrosive role in the public discourse . They \u2019 re all defenders of traditional hierarchies that stand in the way of human flourishing , they all use silly and sophistical arguments in pursuit of this cause . We don \u2019 t object to \u201c platforming \u201d such people for the purpose of pushing back against their views , but Rogan has acted as an uncritical sounding board for them . ( Though there was a hilarious moment in one his conversations with Rubin when Rogan pushed back against Rubin \u2019 s libertarian economic fantasies and Rubin \u2014 a man who says he cares about \u201c ideas \u201d above all else \u2014 was left with no coherent response . ) It \u2019 s also true that Rogan \u2019 s talent , knack for drawing out guests , and interest in a variety of topics has allowed him to build such a massive platform that he \u2019 s far more representative of an actually existing American \u201c center \u201d than any corporate prestige outlet that claims to speak for the \u201c mainstream. \u201d In some contexts , ranging from Palestine to health care to Trump \u2019 s child separation policy he \u2019 s been a voice of reason and compassion . On that last subject , he \u2019 s gone so far as to say that if you don \u2019 t oppose what Trump has done to immigrant and refugee families , \u201c you aren \u2019 t on the team \u201d of the human race . This is the real Joe Rogan show : a total mix of the apolitical and political , the reactionary and the progressive . He \u2019 s in a sense representative of the political zigs and zags of most ordinary people who don \u2019 t think and tweet about politics all the time .\nThe Hypocrisy It \u2019 s worth noting the often maddening inconsistency of many Sanders opponents . Some of the loudest voices assailing the Bernie Sanders campaign for putting out a 51-second video highlighting Rogan \u2019 s praise for their candidate are centrist Democrats who spent eight years defending the politics of Barack Obama and then supported Hillary Clinton in the race for the 2016 Democratic nomination . Some of these critics seem to have very short memories . See for example this tweet from Alex Singer , a former Democratic Congressional candidate in Nevada . Also , Obama won twice , handily , without bigots , homophobes or transphobes . \u2014 Alex Singer ( @ AlexCSinger16 ) January 24 , 2020 In reality , Obama had homophobic pastor Rick Warren say the opening prayer at his first inaugural \u2014 a decision that was controversial even at the time . Part of how Obama could maintain a relatively friendly relationship with someone like Warren is that , when he first ran for president , he claimed to have religious objections to marriage equality . It was only years later that Obama started carefully \u201c evolving \u201d on this issue with one eye on the polls . By contrast , Sanders didn \u2019 t have to give up an inch \u2014 on trans rights or on any other issue \u2014 to get the support of Joe Rogan . Even on the narrow question of shock jocks with a history of making \u201c problematic \u201d comments , some memories are very short . Hillary Clinton went on the Howard Stern Show and basked in Howard \u2019 s praise of her record \u2014 and happily agreed with his criticisms of Bernie Sanders \u2014 last month . There wasn \u2019 t a ripple of \u201c controversy \u201d about it from this crowd . And , if we \u2019 re going to be realistic about this , it \u2019 s hard to imagine that there would have been much controversy if Joe Rogan had said \u201c I think I \u2019 m probably going to vote for Elizabeth Warren because she \u2019 s so smart and she has a plan for , like , everything , man \u201d and the Warren camp had tweeted out a clip of that . In fact , we would be drowning in \u201c Slay Kween \u201d emojis . Our point here isn \u2019 t that Warren would have been wrong to \u201c tout Rogan \u2019 s endorsement \u201d if that had happened , or that Clinton shouldn \u2019 t have gone on Howard Stern . Demonstrating that a criticism is hypocritical isn \u2019 t enough to demonstrate that it \u2019 s wrong . It just means that the people making it are being inconsistent , and thus that they must be wrong about one or the other half of their inconsistent stance . As grating as it is that Bernie is being bombarded with outrage for being endorsed by a podcast host with a mishmash of views while hardly anyone raises an eyebrow at Biden \u2019 s failure to repudiate his endorsement by Steve Lynch , whose record includes some truly despicable homophobia , we aren \u2019 t asking for a more equal distribution of outrage . Quite the opposite . We \u2019 re asking what it would take to build a movement capable of taking on oppression and exploitation .",
