No, that did not come from a critic, it came from one of its designers, Jonathan Gruber\u2019s one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act. Just after the botched rollout began, he made it clear if people knew what was really in the law, it would not have passed.

The issue this time is whether the government may help people pay their premiums in states that did not set up health insurance exchanges. Only 16 states have them. Back in 2012, the Court upheld the main ObamaCare provision, the one that requires almost all Americans to buy health insurance.\n\nThe full transcript of the news brief from November 7's NBC Nightly News can be found below (with thanks to my colleague Kyle Drennen for this segment\u2019s transcript).\n\nNBC Nightly News\n\nNovember 7, 2014\n\n7:08 p.m. Eastern [ON-SCREEN HEADLINE CAPTION: ObamaCare Challenge] BRIAN WILLIAMS: And right about the time the President was breaking bread he got a piece of bad news.
