That is seen here as a sign of a possible warming of bilateral ties and a repudiation of Democrat Hillary Clinton , who had pledged to be more assertive with Russia over Syria and Ukraine .\n\u201c I think that Trump , as a pragmatic person , will scrap anti-Russian sanctions that are also hurting American business , \u201d Sergei Glazyev , a Kremlin economic adviser , told the Tass state news agency . \u201c The entire whole foreign policy of the previous administration was focused on aggression against Russia with the aim of maintaining U.S. hegemony , \u201d he said . \u201c We can say this aggression has failed . \u201d\nAlthough Novaya Gazeta , an opposition-friendly newspaper , criticized what it called Mr. Trump \u2019 s rejection of President Obama \u2019 s \u201c path of progressive change , \u201d many ordinary Russians were positive about the election result \u2014 a sharp contrast to the reaction across much of Western Europe and Asia .\n\u201c Trump will be good for Russia .
