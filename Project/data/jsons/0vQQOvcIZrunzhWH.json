Sometimes a sunny day changes to rain, sometimes snow changes to sleet. The wind blows on Tuesday but changes on Wednesday, from knocking down trees to barely putting a ripple on the surface of the lake. Mark Twain, noticing that some things lie beyond the meddling of man, observed that \u201ceverybody talks about the weather but nobody does anything about it.\u201d\n\nNow someone has. The attorney general of the U.S. Virgin Islands thinks he has found the way to silence, once and for all, the debate over global warming, or climate change, or whatever the radicals-that-be are calling the scheme this week. Global-warming jeremiahs are determined to intimidate, frighten and eventually fine or put in prison anyone who says the wrong thing about this best laid scheme of government.

That\u2019s the beginning.\n\nClaude Walker, the Blackstone of the Caribbean who leads the assault of the attorneys general, presented a subpoena this week to compel the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a public policy think tank in Washington skeptical of the climate scam, to turn over all its documents relating to the Institute\u2019s research.\n\nHis 14-page subpoena, issued through the District of Columbia\u2019s Superior Court, demands the Institute\u2019s documents, communications, emails, op-eds, speeches, advertisements, letters to the editor, research, reports, studies and memoranda of any kind \u2014 including drafts \u2014 that refer to climate change, greenhouse gases, carbon tax, climate science and the like that in any way are related to Exxon Mobil or the \u201cproducts sold by, activities carried out by ExxonMobil that directly or indirectly impact climate change.\u201d\n\nMr. Walker reveals the real intent of his lawsuit with a demand for a list of donors to the Institute, the better to harass them with threats of legal harassment. \u201cWe\u2019ve been targeted for our ideas,\u201d says Kent Lassman, the new president and CEO of the Institute.
