Hogan , the Republican governor of Maryland , is meeting with his coronavirus command team , a skeleton crew of state officials still reporting to the capitol in Annapolis . The conference rooms are all too narrow , so they are gathered in a cavernous event room , seated in alternate chairs to maintain social distancing . Hogan , a ruddy 63-year-old with jug-handle ears , has in front of him a dispenser of hand sanitizer , a can of Diet Coke and a starfish-shaped conference-call speaker .\nThe President , Hogan reminds the group , recently chided him for going around Vice President Mike Pence \u2019 s coronavirus task force to procure supplies . \u201c Remember , Trump said , \u2018 He \u2019 s wasting his time . He should \u2019 ve just called Mike ! ' \u201d He laughs a wheezy laugh . \u201c So I \u2019 m gon na joke with him and say , \u2018 Hey , Mike , where \u2019 s my tests ? The President said I should just call you ! \u2019 But then seriously say , \u2018 You both said we can use federal labs . When can we start ?

Peter van Agtmael\u2014Magnum Photos for TIME\nLike every other governor in America , Hogan is dealing with a crisis for which there is no playbook . The team assembled here began its April 22 briefing on a somber note , as the state \u2019 s health secretary , Bobby Neall , read off the numbers : 14,775 total confirmed cases of COVID-19 , up 582 from the day before ; 631 deaths in the past five weeks , up 47 from the previous day \u2019 s count . Hogan was briefed about a possible outbreak at a chicken plant on the Delaware border and about a convention center being converted into a field hospital ; he got word that his latest shipment of testing supplies from South Korea had arrived , greeted at Baltimore-Washington International Airport by his Korean-American wife Yumi with platters of crab cakes and kimchi .\nHogan has worked around the clock since declaring a state of emergency 48 days earlier , issuing 38 executive orders and calling up the state \u2019 s National Guard . The closest thing he can imagine is a natural disaster , he says , but even that doesn \u2019 t capture it . \u201c This is like a hurricane that hits all 50 states every single day , \u201d he tells me later , crammed into a navy blue armchair in his spacious office decorated with memorabilia . \u201c And it continues in intensity . It doesn \u2019 t go away . It just keeps hitting , hitting , hitting . \u201d\nFrom Tallahassee to Olympia , in big states and small , every governor in America has improvised something like this , scrambling to keep up with the outbreak . The governors are constantly comparing notes\u2013in the past 24 hours , Hogan tells me , he \u2019 s texted with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo , Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and Arizona Governor Doug Ducey . As chairman of the National Governors Association ( NGA ) , Hogan has tried to coordinate their efforts , convening a series of calls in which they trade ideas and information .\nThe cooperation has been crucial .

Peter van Agtmael\u2014Magnum Photos for TIME\nAt 1 P.M. , Hogan settles back at the table for today \u2019 s governors-only teleconference . Forty-four governors have dialed in to the call , the 16th Hogan has convened since the start of the pandemic . \u201c My question is , for those who received the Abbott machines , we received 15 , but we only received 120 cartridges and/or kits we could actually test with , \u201d says Andy Beshear , the governor of Kentucky . \u201c Is anybody getting any more of these kits from the federal government ? \u201d\nThe rapid-testing device made by Abbott Laboratories , a sleek white gizmo the size of a bread box , was touted by Trump in a March 29 Rose Garden press conference . The President called the machine , which can produce a result in as little as five minutes , \u201c a whole new ballgame. \u201d The truth fell far short of that boast .\n\u201c Andy , this is Andrew , \u201d New York \u2019 s Governor Cuomo replies . \u201c My experience is , these companies will sell the machines , which are several million dollars each , but then they don \u2019 t deliver the test kits and the reagents . And then they say the federal government is doing the allocation of the test kits. \u201d ( In a statement , Abbott said the allotment to states was \u201c only a fraction \u201d of its tests and that its ID NOW machines cost less than $ 5,000 each . )\nA food distribution site for the needy during the Coronavirus pandemic in Baltimore , Md. , on April 24 .

The Maryland Food bank has seen a 100 % demand increase coupled with a massive decline in donations of food as people conserve their non-perishable canned goods . Peter van Agtmael\u2014Magnum Photos for TIME\nTwo more governors say they \u2019 ve faced some of the same difficulties , while another says she can \u2019 t even figure out whom in Washington to call about tests . ( Hogan gives her a name . ) Several of the governors complain that the Administration seems less interested in helping than in finding ways to shift blame to the states .\nThese calls have been a lifeline for the governors , their principal source of unfiltered information and advice from their colleagues in the trenches of the battle against the virus . \u201c The NGA \u2019 s never been as important as it is now , probably in decades , if not ever , \u201d Cuomo says . The governors have been thrust into a no-win situation by the federal government , he says , making it all the more important that they stick together .\nAs the governors speak , Congress and the White House have just struck a deal to spend $ 484 billion to replenish a small-business aid fund . But money for state and local governments got negotiated away , shelved for the next bill . It \u2019 s a major problem for the governors , whose tax revenues have taken a massive hit from the crisis . Just 90 days of state-ordered sheltering in place is projected to blow an estimated $ 3 billion hole in Maryland \u2019 s $ 50 billion annual budget . The very governments that are providing vital services to keep their locked-down states afloat have been thanked for their efforts with a pile of bills they can \u2019 t pay . And while Trump has repeatedly expressed support for sending aid to the states , Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell threw cold water on the idea , saying states should explore bankruptcy instead .\nMaryland National Guard members prepare a food distribution site for the needy in Stevensville , Md. , on April 17 .

Peter van Agtmael\u2014Magnum Photos for TIME\nThat \u2019 s not the only burden the states face . The recent congressional aid package that expanded unemployment benefits mandated that they be extended to independent contractors and the self-employed . But the package gave the states , which administer unemployment insurance , no mechanism to distribute these benefits . The phone lines of Maryland \u2019 s unemployment office were jammed with tens of thousands of calls , Hogan says .

He \u2019 s short and round , with a pronounced Maryland accent . Once blessed with a big white swoosh of Republican-real-estate-developer hair , he \u2019 s worn it close-shaved since recovering from lymphoma in 2015 . As with most authentic-seeming politicians , there \u2019 s more than a little ambition behind Hogan \u2019 s regular-guy persona . His father was a Republican Congressman\u2013the first Republican member of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee to call for President Richard Nixon \u2019 s impeachment\u2013and a young Hogan hoped to follow him into politics . But after two failed runs for Congress , he went into business instead , pausing to serve a stint as appointments secretary to Governor Robert Ehrlich from 2003 to 2007 .\nWhen Hogan sought the governorship in 2014 , he cast himself as a fiscally focused uniter who would cut taxes and forswear social issues . But Maryland was trending so blue that the forecaster Nate Silver gave Hogan a less than 10 % chance of victory . \u201c This is a guy nobody thought had a chance to win , but I could just tell he had real skills , \u201d says Hogan \u2019 s friend Chris Christie , the former New Jersey governor .\nWorshipers pray at Jesus \u2019 Church Sunday `` Drive Thru '' service in Great Marsh Park , Cambridge , Md. , on April 5 .

Peter van Agtmael\u2014Magnum Photos for TIME\nHogan was tested early . Three months after he was sworn in , riots broke out in Baltimore over the death in police custody of 25-year-old Freddie Gray . Hogan went to Baltimore and set up a command post , working from the city and walking the streets every day . Keiffer Mitchell , a Democratic former Baltimore city councilman who now serves in Hogan \u2019 s cabinet , recalls advising Hogan against approaching a group of gang members with neck tattoos . But the governor ignored him and won them over , Mitchell says , promising to attend to priorities like rec centers if they \u2019 d help him keep the city safe .\nJust two months after the protests , Hogan was diagnosed with Stage III non-Hodgkin \u2019 s lymphoma . Rather than seclude himself during his treatment , he chronicled the illness on Facebook , posting pictures of himself hooked up to chemotherapy tubes or working from the hospital . Letters and comments poured in from Marylanders who \u2019 d been through or watched a loved one go through a similar ordeal .\nThe current crisis has showcased Hogan \u2019 s resourcefulness . Faced with the shortage of testing kits that has bedeviled many states , Hogan noticed that his wife Yumi \u2019 s native South Korea had a surplus . The country had a policy of not selling to states . But over three weeks of intensive negotiations in her native language , Yumi Hogan\u2013an abstract painter who is thought to be America \u2019 s first Korean-American first lady\u2013helped broker a deal to purchase 500,000 tests and fly them to Maryland on idled Korean Air passenger planes . The talks were conducted in secrecy to prevent the federal government from intercepting and commandeering the shipment , as it has done with other supplies acquired by states . The Food and Drug Administration cleared the tests while the plane was in the air .\nRoute 50 is quiet during the Coronavirus stay at home order in Wye Mills , Md. , on April 18 . Peter van Agtmael\u2014Magnum Photos for TIME\nHogan \u2019 s testing coup angered Trump . \u201c He didn \u2019 t understand too much about what was going on , \u201d Trump said of Hogan on April 20 . Hogan says Washington followed up by sending him a list of laboratories in his state , none of which had coronavirus tests on hand . Most were federal government labs the state couldn \u2019 t even access . Hence the appeal to Pence .\nHogan \u2019 s reputation for pragmatism and moderation has won him approval scores in the 70s from Republicans , Democrats and independents alike and from both white and African-American residents . \u201c I can \u2019 t even find Democrats in my own family who disapprove of the job he \u2019 s doing , \u201d says Donna Edwards , a former Democratic Congresswoman from Maryland \u2019 s D.C. suburbs . In 2016 , Hogan boycotted the Republican National Convention and wrote in his father \u2019 s name on his presidential ballot . \u201c That was the kind of Republican that I wanted to vote for , \u201d Hogan tells me . Last year , a group of anti-Trump Republicans tried to persuade Hogan to run for President . Hogan , as he puts it , \u201c didn \u2019 t throw them out of my office , \u201d but eventually decided Trump \u2019 s popularity with the Republican base made him unbeatable in a primary .\nHogan \u2019 s father died in 2017 . The governor hasn \u2019 t decided whom to vote for this November . He doesn \u2019 t rule out voting Democratic . As for Trump , Hogan says , \u201c he hasn \u2019 t done anything to make me change my mind . \u201d\nWhen i ask Hogan what he misses most about life before the pandemic , he gets wistful . \u201c I \u2019 m a people person , \u201d he says . \u201c Usually I \u2019 d be at events all day and all night. \u201d One of the highlights of Hogan \u2019 s year is opening day of the baseball season in the spring , when he spends hours walking around Oriole Park at Camden Yards , greeting people , shaking thousands of hands and taking hundreds of selfies . This year , of course , there was no opening day . \u201c That \u2019 s what I miss about normal life , \u201d he says . \u201c I miss people . \u201d\nOn April 24 , Hogan announced a phased reopening plan based on a series of testing and tracing benchmarks . The point is to keep people safe , he tells me , but also to give them hope : they have to know there \u2019 s a light at the end of this tunnel . That the leaders they \u2019 ve elected have a plan , even if it \u2019 s far from clear when they \u2019 ll be able to put it into effect .\nStreet signs during the Coronavirus pandemic in Ocean City , Md. , on April 16 . Peter van Agtmael\u2014Magnum Photos for TIME\nThe credibility Hogan \u2019 s built with his constituents will be critical to the reopening effort . It \u2019 s a quality that \u2019 s been in short supply in the White House , where a few hours after Hogan speaks , Trump will force Redfield to \u201c correct \u201d an article that quoted him accurately , and where the next day the President will muse about injecting disinfectant into people \u2019 s bodies . After receiving hundreds of calls to its hotline , Maryland \u2019 s emergency-management agency is forced to issue a warning that \u201c under no circumstances should any disinfectant product be administered into the body through injection , ingestion or any other route . \u201d\nFor the most part , Maryland \u2019 s residents have followed Hogan \u2019 s lead . A small protest erupted in Annapolis on April 18 , demanding an end to the governor \u2019 s stay-at-home order . Hogan wasn \u2019 t there to see it because he was at the airport receiving the South Korean test kits . \u201c I didn \u2019 t think it was helpful for the President to be encouraging people to go out and protest , \u201d he says . Trump \u2019 s tweets urging people to \u201c liberate \u201d certain states , he notes , came the day after the President \u2019 s own Administration issued guidelines calling for the stay-at-home orders to be kept in place for now .\nTo the protesters , however , Hogan offers not a rebuke but sympathy . \u201c I get the frustration , \u201d he says . \u201c I want it to be over , you know ? I \u2019 m tired of it also. \u201d As the pandemic response moves into its next phase , it will be up to Hogan and the other governors to lead the way .\nUpdate , April 30 : This story was updated on April 30 to note the price of the Abbott Laboratories ID NOW coronavirus testing instrument .\nAn empty parking lot in the beach town of Ocean City , Md. , on April 16 .

The team assembled here began its April 22 briefing on a somber note, as the state\u2019s health secretary, Bobby Neall, read off the numbers: 14,775 total confirmed cases of COVID-19, up 582 from the day before; 631 deaths in the past five weeks, up 47 from the previous day\u2019s count. Hogan was briefed about a possible outbreak at a chicken plant on the Delaware border and about a convention center being converted into a field hospital; he got word that his latest shipment of testing supplies from South Korea had arrived, greeted at Baltimore-Washington International Airport by his Korean-American wife Yumi with platters of crab cakes and kimchi.\n\nHogan has worked around the clock since declaring a state of emergency 48 days earlier, issuing 38 executive orders and calling up the state\u2019s National Guard. The closest thing he can imagine is a natural disaster, he says, but even that doesn\u2019t capture it. \u201cThis is like a hurricane that hits all 50 states every single day,\u201d he tells me later, crammed into a navy blue armchair in his spacious office decorated with memorabilia. \u201cAnd it continues in intensity. It doesn\u2019t go away. It just keeps hitting, hitting, hitting.\u201d\n\nFrom Tallahassee to Olympia, in big states and small, every governor in America has improvised something like this, scrambling to keep up with the outbreak. The governors are constantly comparing notes\u2013in the past 24 hours, Hogan tells me, he\u2019s texted with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and Arizona Governor Doug Ducey. As chairman of the National Governors Association (NGA), Hogan has tried to coordinate their efforts, convening a series of calls in which they trade ideas and information.\n\nThe cooperation has been crucial. Governors will tell you they\u2019re always the officials whose leadership most directly affects people\u2019s lives. But that\u2019s been truer than ever in the current crisis, as Trump has been more occupied with defending his performance and casting blame than with mounting the kind of coordinated national effort that other countries\u2019 leaders have orchestrated.

Forty-four governors have dialed in to the call, the 16th Hogan has convened since the start of the pandemic. \u201cMy question is, for those who received the Abbott machines, we received 15, but we only received 120 cartridges and/or kits we could actually test with,\u201d says Andy Beshear, the governor of Kentucky. \u201cIs anybody getting any more of these kits from the federal government?\u201d\n\nThe rapid-testing device made by Abbott Laboratories, a sleek white gizmo the size of a bread box, was touted by Trump in a March 29 Rose Garden press conference. The President called the machine, which can produce a result in as little as five minutes, \u201ca whole new ballgame.\u201d The truth fell far short of that boast.\n\n\u201cAndy, this is Andrew,\u201d New York\u2019s Governor Cuomo replies. \u201cMy experience is, these companies will sell the machines, which are several million dollars each, but then they don\u2019t deliver the test kits and the reagents. And then they say the federal government is doing the allocation of the test kits.\u201d (In a statement, Abbott said the allotment to states was \u201conly a fraction\u201d of its tests and that its ID NOW machines cost less than $5,000 each.)\n\nA food distribution site for the needy during the Coronavirus pandemic in Baltimore, Md., on April 24.

(Hogan gives her a name.) Several of the governors complain that the Administration seems less interested in helping than in finding ways to shift blame to the states.\n\nThese calls have been a lifeline for the governors, their principal source of unfiltered information and advice from their colleagues in the trenches of the battle against the virus. \u201cThe NGA\u2019s never been as important as it is now, probably in decades, if not ever,\u201d Cuomo says. The governors have been thrust into a no-win situation by the federal government, he says, making it all the more important that they stick together.\n\nAs the governors speak, Congress and the White House have just struck a deal to spend $484 billion to replenish a small-business aid fund. But money for state and local governments got negotiated away, shelved for the next bill. It\u2019s a major problem for the governors, whose tax revenues have taken a massive hit from the crisis. Just 90 days of state-ordered sheltering in place is projected to blow an estimated $3 billion hole in Maryland\u2019s $50 billion annual budget. The very governments that are providing vital services to keep their locked-down states afloat have been thanked for their efforts with a pile of bills they can\u2019t pay. And while Trump has repeatedly expressed support for sending aid to the states, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell threw cold water on the idea, saying states should explore bankruptcy instead.\n\nMaryland National Guard members prepare a food distribution site for the needy in Stevensville, Md., on April 17.

The recent congressional aid package that expanded unemployment benefits mandated that they be extended to independent contractors and the self-employed. But the package gave the states, which administer unemployment insurance, no mechanism to distribute these benefits. The phone lines of Maryland\u2019s unemployment office were jammed with tens of thousands of calls, Hogan says. The governors on the call exchange tips on creating websites to deal with the problem.\n\nOutlet stores shut down during Coronavirus pandemic in Queenstown, Md., on April 14. Peter van Agtmael\u2014Magnum Photos for TIME\n\nHogan crouches impatiently over the conference-call starfish, rifling through his stack of papers. He\u2019s short and round, with a pronounced Maryland accent. Once blessed with a big white swoosh of Republican-real-estate-developer hair, he\u2019s worn it close-shaved since recovering from lymphoma in 2015. As with most authentic-seeming politicians, there\u2019s more than a little ambition behind Hogan\u2019s regular-guy persona. His father was a Republican Congressman\u2013the first Republican member of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee to call for President Richard Nixon\u2019s impeachment\u2013and a young Hogan hoped to follow him into politics. But after two failed runs for Congress, he went into business instead, pausing to serve a stint as appointments secretary to Governor Robert Ehrlich from 2003 to 2007.\n\nWhen Hogan sought the governorship in 2014, he cast himself as a fiscally focused uniter who would cut taxes and forswear social issues. But Maryland was trending so blue that the forecaster Nate Silver gave Hogan a less than 10% chance of victory. \u201cThis is a guy nobody thought had a chance to win, but I could just tell he had real skills,\u201d says Hogan\u2019s friend Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor.\n\nWorshipers pray at Jesus\u2019 Church Sunday \"Drive Thru\" service in Great Marsh Park, Cambridge, Md., on April 5.

Peter van Agtmael\u2014Magnum Photos for TIME\n\nHogan was tested early. Three months after he was sworn in, riots broke out in Baltimore over the death in police custody of 25-year-old Freddie Gray. Hogan went to Baltimore and set up a command post, working from the city and walking the streets every day. Keiffer Mitchell, a Democratic former Baltimore city councilman who now serves in Hogan\u2019s cabinet, recalls advising Hogan against approaching a group of gang members with neck tattoos. But the governor ignored him and won them over, Mitchell says, promising to attend to priorities like rec centers if they\u2019d help him keep the city safe.\n\nJust two months after the protests, Hogan was diagnosed with Stage III non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. Rather than seclude himself during his treatment, he chronicled the illness on Facebook, posting pictures of himself hooked up to chemotherapy tubes or working from the hospital. Letters and comments poured in from Marylanders who\u2019d been through or watched a loved one go through a similar ordeal.\n\nThe current crisis has showcased Hogan\u2019s resourcefulness. Faced with the shortage of testing kits that has bedeviled many states, Hogan noticed that his wife Yumi\u2019s native South Korea had a surplus. The country had a policy of not selling to states. But over three weeks of intensive negotiations in her native language, Yumi Hogan\u2013an abstract painter who is thought to be America\u2019s first Korean-American first lady\u2013helped broker a deal to purchase 500,000 tests and fly them to Maryland on idled Korean Air passenger planes. The talks were conducted in secrecy to prevent the federal government from intercepting and commandeering the shipment, as it has done with other supplies acquired by states. The Food and Drug Administration cleared the tests while the plane was in the air.\n\nRoute 50 is quiet during the Coronavirus stay at home order in Wye Mills, Md., on April 18. Peter van Agtmael\u2014Magnum Photos for TIME\n\nHogan\u2019s testing coup angered Trump. \u201cHe didn\u2019t understand too much about what was going on,\u201d Trump said of Hogan on April 20. Hogan says Washington followed up by sending him a list of laboratories in his state, none of which had coronavirus tests on hand. Most were federal government labs the state couldn\u2019t even access. Hence the appeal to Pence.\n\nHogan\u2019s reputation for pragmatism and moderation has won him approval scores in the 70s from Republicans, Democrats and independents alike and from both white and African-American residents. \u201cI can\u2019t even find Democrats in my own family who disapprove of the job he\u2019s doing,\u201d says Donna Edwards, a former Democratic Congresswoman from Maryland\u2019s D.C. suburbs. In 2016, Hogan boycotted the Republican National Convention and wrote in his father\u2019s name on his presidential ballot. \u201cThat was the kind of Republican that I wanted to vote for,\u201d Hogan tells me. Last year, a group of anti-Trump Republicans tried to persuade Hogan to run for President. Hogan, as he puts it, \u201cdidn\u2019t throw them out of my office,\u201d but eventually decided Trump\u2019s popularity with the Republican base made him unbeatable in a primary.\n\nHogan\u2019s father died in 2017. The governor hasn\u2019t decided whom to vote for this November. He doesn\u2019t rule out voting Democratic. As for Trump, Hogan says, \u201che hasn\u2019t done anything to make me change my mind.\u201d\n\nWhen i ask Hogan what he misses most about life before the pandemic, he gets wistful. \u201cI\u2019m a people person,\u201d he says. \u201cUsually I\u2019d be at events all day and all night.\u201d One of the highlights of Hogan\u2019s year is opening day of the baseball season in the spring, when he spends hours walking around Oriole Park at Camden Yards, greeting people, shaking thousands of hands and taking hundreds of selfies. This year, of course, there was no opening day. \u201cThat\u2019s what I miss about normal life,\u201d he says. \u201cI miss people.\u201d\n\nOn April 24, Hogan announced a phased reopening plan based on a series of testing and tracing benchmarks. The point is to keep people safe, he tells me, but also to give them hope: they have to know there\u2019s a light at the end of this tunnel. That the leaders they\u2019ve elected have a plan, even if it\u2019s far from clear when they\u2019ll be able to put it into effect.\n\nStreet signs during the Coronavirus pandemic in Ocean City, Md., on April 16. Peter van Agtmael\u2014Magnum Photos for TIME\n\nThe credibility Hogan\u2019s built with his constituents will be critical to the reopening effort. It\u2019s a quality that\u2019s been in short supply in the White House, where a few hours after Hogan speaks, Trump will force Redfield to \u201ccorrect\u201d an article that quoted him accurately, and where the next day the President will muse about injecting disinfectant into people\u2019s bodies. After receiving hundreds of calls to its hotline, Maryland\u2019s emergency-management agency is forced to issue a warning that \u201cunder no circumstances should any disinfectant product be administered into the body through injection, ingestion or any other route.\u201d\n\nFor the most part, Maryland\u2019s residents have followed Hogan\u2019s lead. A small protest erupted in Annapolis on April 18, demanding an end to the governor\u2019s stay-at-home order. Hogan wasn\u2019t there to see it because he was at the airport receiving the South Korean test kits. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it was helpful for the President to be encouraging people to go out and protest,\u201d he says. Trump\u2019s tweets urging people to \u201cliberate\u201d certain states, he notes, came the day after the President\u2019s own Administration issued guidelines calling for the stay-at-home orders to be kept in place for now.\n\nTo the protesters, however, Hogan offers not a rebuke but sympathy. \u201cI get the frustration,\u201d he says. \u201cI want it to be over, you know? I\u2019m tired of it also.\u201d As the pandemic response moves into its next phase, it will be up to Hogan and the other governors to lead the way.\n\nUpdate, April 30: This story was updated on April 30 to note the price of the Abbott Laboratories ID NOW coronavirus testing instrument.\n\nAn empty parking lot in the beach town of Ocean City, Md., on April 16.
