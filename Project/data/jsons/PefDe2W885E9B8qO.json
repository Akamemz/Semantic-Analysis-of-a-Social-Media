The latest was an Obama Web video blasting Romney 's `` strange take on tax fairness . '' It included clips of people accusing Romney of paying a lower rate than `` average '' Americans . An accompanying campaign email said : `` Mitt Romney admitted he thinks it 's fair that his $ 20 million income was taxed at a lower rate than someone making $ 50,000 . ''\nIRS data , though , shows that Romney 's effective income tax rate -- that 's what he pays as a percentage of his income once deductions and other benefits are factored in -- is actually far higher than what most Americans pay .\nAnd it 's certainly higher than what someone making $ 50,000 pays .\nIRS data from 2010 shows someone making between $ 50,000 and $ 75,000 on average pays an effective rate of 7.8 percent . Even someone making between $ 100,000 and $ 200,000 pays a 12.1 percent rate -- also lower than Romney 's .\nSo what is the Obama campaign referring to ? There are a couple possibilities .\nThe campaign likely is trying to make the point that Romney 's income -- at least the huge chunk of it that is derived from investments -- is taxed at a 15 percent rate , while others who earn their money from a paycheck are taxed at marginal income rates going all the way up to 35 percent .\nThe latter percentage , though , comes down once deductions and exemptions are included . The Tax Foundation estimated in a report in January that Romney 's rate in 2010 -- which was also about 14 percent -- was higher than what 97 percent of Americans pay .\nThe math works out better for the Obama campaign 's claims if all payroll taxes are included in the formula .\nSince Romney earns most his income from investments and not from a paycheck , he does n't have to pay much toward Social Security and Medicare taxes .
