Mr. Trump instead squeezed Ankara further , raising tariffs on Turkish steel imports to 50 % and aluminum to 20 % , which deepened the Turkish lira \u2019 s drop and worsened market fears that its banks could be shaken .\nAdministration officials didn \u2019 t clarify Mr. Trump \u2019 s motives . The move followed a series of actions the Trump administration has taken in recent weeks to step up economic pressure on Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to release American evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson .\nThe doubled tariffs weren \u2019 t related to Mr. Brunson , administration officials said Friday . White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said the tariffs were meant to protect the U.S. on national-security grounds , \u201c independent of negotiations on trade or any other matter . \u201d\nIn a formal proclamation of the move issued Friday night\u2014nearly 12 hours after the president first announced it on Twitter\u2014the White House said the action was taken because the original global tariffs hadn \u2019 t done as much as the administration had desired to boost domestic production of steel and aluminum . The statement didn \u2019 t explain why Turkey alone was hit with the higher tariffs .\nIn his tweet , Mr. Trump seemed to link the tariffs to soured ties between the two nations , suggesting a willingness to impose trade sanctions as a lever in pursuit of unrelated U.S. diplomatic goals . A spokesman for the White House National Security Council said Friday that Turkey has \u201c much to lose \u201d in continuing to hold Mr. Brunson .\nMr. Trump may also have been seeking to insulate the U.S. from any trade advantage Turkey could exploit from the currency drop .\n\u201c I have just authorized a doubling of Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum with respect to Turkey as their currency , the Turkish Lira , slides rapidly downward against our very strong Dollar ! , \u201d the president wrote a few minutes before 9 a.m. Friday after the lira had dropped 14 % overnight against the dollar . \u201c Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time ! \u201d he added .\nOver three decades of periodic currency storms , such as the early 1990s Mexican peso plunge , and the Asian crisis a few years later , \u201c the market \u2019 s underlying assumption was that the U.S. would try to be helpful \u201d during periods of extreme foreign-exchange volatility , said Shahab Jalinoos , head of global currency strategy at Credit Suisse Group . `` Now the market can no longer assume that . \u201d\nForeign-exchange collapses can be perilous for emerging markets , particularly when they have borrowed heavily in dollars and thus find it harder to repay those debts as their own currencies fall .\nWhite House and Treasury officials didn \u2019 t respond to requests for comment about the administration \u2019 s broader strategy toward global currency-market instability , or about the economic considerations behind the increased tariffs .\nUnder his \u201c America First \u201d platform , Mr. Trump has sought to reorient U.S. economic policies , breaking with a longstanding bipartisan consensus that Washington \u2019 s mission was to take the lead in expanding , strengthening and stabilizing commercial and financial ties across countries\u2014and that such globalization was broadly in America \u2019 s self-interest , even if it might disadvantage some U.S. industries or communities .\nMr. Trump has challenged that orthodoxy , arguing that such policies have undermined American economic strength . He has revived long-dormant policies to block imports he considers threatening to the U.S. , and brushed aside warnings that such moves could harm the global trading system . He has argued that the U.S. should do more to use its economic and financial clout to force other countries to change policies he considers unfair to the U.S .\nThe tariffs that Mr. Trump said he was doubling were imposed earlier this year , not just on Turkey but on virtually every metals exporter around the world . The administration imposed tariffs of 25 % on steel and 10 % on aluminum by invoking a little-used Cold War-era law that allows presidents to block imports he deems a threat to American \u201c national security . \u201d\nMr. Trump \u2019 s broad use of that power provoked outrage from trading partners around the world , who said it violated World Trade Organization limits on such unilateral trade curbs and hit allies who posed no threat to U.S. security . Turkey is an ally and member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .\nMany countries retaliated with their own tariffs on U.S. exports . Among them was Turkey , which in June put import taxes on $ 1.8 billion worth of U.S. coal , paper , walnuts , tobacco and other products .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s mention of the Turkish lira \u2019 s plunge suggested a willingness to tolerate the currency \u2019 s collapse .\nFollowing Mr. Trump \u2019 s tweet , the lira fell another 9 % and then recovered some of its losses . Turkey \u2019 s currency woes have stoked instability in other emerging markets such as South Africa , Hungary and Russia , as investors worry about similar fragility there .
