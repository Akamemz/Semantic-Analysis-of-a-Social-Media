Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they \u2019 re published .\nSince May , the Trump administration has paid a fledgling Texas company $ 7.3 million for test tubes needed in tracking the spread of the coronavirus nationwide . But , instead of the standard vials , Fillakit LLC has supplied plastic tubes made for bottling soda , which state health officials say are unusable .\nThe state officials say that these \u201c preforms , \u201d which are designed to be expanded with heat and pressure into 2-liter soda bottles , don \u2019 t fit the racks used in laboratory analysis of test samples . Even if the bottles were the right size , experts say , the company \u2019 s process likely contaminated the tubes and could yield false test results . Fillakit employees , some not wearing masks , gathered the miniature soda bottles with snow shovels and dumped them into plastic bins before squirting saline into them , all in the open air , according to former employees and \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s observation of the company \u2019 s operations .\n\u201c It wasn \u2019 t even clean , let alone sterile , \u201d said Teresa Green , a retired science teacher who worked at Fillakit \u2019 s makeshift warehouse outside of Houston for two weeks before leaving out of frustration .\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency signed its first deal with Fillakit on May 7 , just six days after the company was formed by an ex-telemarketer repeatedly accused of fraudulent practices over the past two decades . Fillakit has supplied a total of more than 3 million tubes , which FEMA then approved and sent to all 50 states . If the company fulfills its contractual obligation to provide 4 million tubes , it will receive a total of $ 10.16 million .\nOfficials in New York , New Jersey , Texas and New Mexico confirmed they can \u2019 t use the Fillakit tubes . Three other states told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that they received Fillakit supplies and have not distributed them to testing sites . FEMA has asked health officials in several states to find an alternative use for the unfinished soda bottles .\n\u201c We are still trying to identify an alternative use , \u201d said Janelle Fleming , a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of Health .\nFillakit owner Paul Wexler acknowledged that the tubes are normally used for soda bottles but otherwise declined to comment .\nGet Our Top Investigations Subscribe to the Big Story newsletter .\nThe Fillakit deal shows the perils of the Trump administration \u2019 s frantic hiring of first-time federal contractors with little scrutiny during the pandemic . The federal government has awarded more than $ 2 billion to first-time contractors for work related to the coronavirus , a \u2588\u2588\u2588 analysis of purchasing data shows . Many of those companies , like Fillakit , had no experience with medical supplies .\nThe U.S. has lagged behind many European countries in its rate of testing people for the coronavirus , partly because of supply shortages or inadequacies . Epidemiologists say testing is vital to tracking the virus and slowing transmission . In at least one state , the shipment of unusable Fillakit tubes contributed to delays in rolling out widespread testing .\n\u201c They \u2019 re the most unusable tubes I \u2019 ve ever seen , \u201d said a top public health scientist in that state , who asked to remain anonymous to protect his job . \u201c They \u2019 re going to sit in a warehouse and no one can use them . We won \u2019 t be able to do our full plan . \u201d\nIn a written response to questions , FEMA said it inspects testing products \u201c to ensure packaging is intact to maintain sterility ; that the packing slip matches the requested product ordered , and that the vials are not leaking. \u201d It said that \u201c product validation \u201d that medical supplies are effective \u201c is reinforced at the state laboratories . \u201d\nThe agency did not answer questions about the size and lack of sterilization of Fillakit \u2019 s tubes or about why it sought an alternative use for them .\nFillakit is one of more than 300 new federal contractors providing supplies related to COVID-19 . A \u2588\u2588\u2588 analysis last month found about 13 % of total federal government spending on pandemic-related contracts went to first-time vendors . FEMA said last month that it only pays for products once they have been delivered , minimizing the risk of wasting taxpayer dollars .\n\u201c FEMA does not enter into contracts unless it has reason to believe they will be successfully executed , \u201d it said .\nPreforms , the small tubes also known in the plastics industry as \u201c baby soda bottles \u201d or \u201c blanks , \u201d have a following among elementary school science teachers and amateur scientists , but they don \u2019 t meet rigorous laboratory standards . They \u2019 re much cheaper than glass vials and can be sealed off with a soda bottle cap . When inflated with high-pressure air , the soft plastic expands to the size of a 2-liter soda bottle .\nThe preforms arrive at Fillakit \u2019 s warehouse in a huge shipping container . The tubes are then shoveled into smaller bins . Workers add the saline solution and screw on caps . The tubes are then loosely piled in bags and sent to FEMA , which forwards them to the states . Typically , test tubes are individually packaged to guard against contamination .\nWashington state , an epicenter of the first outbreak of the virus , got more than 76,000 Fillakit vials from FEMA . None can be used .\n\u201c They were packaged unusually , \u201d said Frank Ameduri , a spokesman for the state Health Department . \u201c Not in a way we \u2019 re used to seeing , and they were not labeled . Some of them have been sent to our lab for quality control . None of the vials will be used until we \u2019 ve identified what \u2019 s in them and that they are safe for use . \u201d\nAbout 140,000 Fillakit tubes are also shelved in Texas , where officials were slow to roll out testing . The number of confirmed cases in Texas has increased by more than one-third in the past two weeks , according to data gathered by The COVID Tracking Project .\n\u201c There were issues with the labeling , and they use saline rather than viral transport medium , so we have not used them for our testing efforts , \u201d said Chris Van Deusen , a spokesman for the Texas health department .\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has only validated one solution , known as viral transport medium , as reliable in preserving the coronavirus RNA from decay or destruction by substances in the container . However , because that medium is in short supply , the FDA has also granted an emergency authorization for other products it believes can keep the virus intact for up to three days .\nFillakit has been squirting one of the alternatives into its tubes , phosphate buffered saline , which the FDA says should be placed into \u201c a sterile glass or plastic vial . \u201d\nA spokeswoman for the Maryland-based Association of Public Health Laboratories , a membership organization that writes best practices and helps connect public health labs with government agencies , said it has heard rumblings about Fillakit \u2019 s tubes but \u201c nothing deadly . \u201d\n\u201c The bigger issue is the size of the tubes , \u201d said the spokeswoman , Michelle Forman . \u201c They are an unusual shape so they don \u2019 t fit racks , and we are getting lots of pushback about how difficult it is to work with them from our clinical partners . \u201d\nFillakit \u2019 s plastic tubes don \u2019 t fit the racks used to analyze samples . ( Provided by the New Mexico Department of Health )\nRichard Loeb , a contract law expert at the University of Baltimore , said FEMA has the power to claw back money paid to contractors , remove them from the government \u2019 s list of approved vendors or refer them to the agency \u2019 s inspector general .\n\u201c It \u2019 s outrageous enough that they [ FEMA ] ordered something to test for COVID-19 , and they got something that can \u2019 t be used to test for COVID-19 , \u201d Loeb said . \u201c I still am a little bit troubled as to why FEMA accepted them . ... They may have stupidly accepted something that was nonconforming . \u201d\nWexler , Fillakit \u2019 s owner , has a background in law and real estate , not medical supplies . In 2012 , the Federal Trade Commission accused Wexler and his telemarketing firm of illegal robocalling , making unauthorized charges to consumers \u2019 bank accounts and falsely claiming to be a nonprofit organization . Wexler \u2019 s firm allegedly misrepresented itself as a credit counseling service for several years , charging customers for work it did not do , according to court records .\nWexler , who denied the charges , settled the case a year later . The settlement banned him from offering debt relief services \u2014 but not from being a federal contractor \u2014 and imposed a $ 2.7 million judgment .\nFillakit and another Wexler company , Cleargate Labs , operate out of the same warehouse in The Woodlands , a sprawling Houston suburb .\nCleargate describes itself as a \u201c network of primary clinical laboratories \u201d on its website . Last year , the company cold-called an elderly Iowa woman , told her that it was marketing a DNA screening for cancer genes and offered to send her testing supplies in exchange for her Medicare number , the Tampa Bay Times reported . Suspecting a scam , the woman reported the company to local law enforcement . Cleargate did not bill her and was not charged with a crime .\nThree former Fillakit employees said that its process was unsterile . Workers shoveled up the tubes from unsanitary surfaces . The liquid that they added to each tube to preserve samples for lab analysis was kept in trays exposed to the air , which was whipped around by large fans .\nSearch Our Database Coronavirus Contracts : Tracking Federal Purchases to Fight the Pandemic The federal government is spending billions of dollars to combat the coronavirus , and spending shows no sign of slowing down . Explore who the U.S. is buying from , what it \u2019 s buying and how much it \u2019 s paying .\nStandards were compromised in the rush to meet productivity goals , Green said . \u201c At the beginning , they were being picky , saying , \u2018 You have to make sure it \u2019 s at least 2 milliliters. \u2019 And sometimes there were tubes that didn \u2019 t have any [ solution ] in there , \u201d she said .\nWexler would come in and \u201c cuss and scream at everybody in this warehouse about how nobody \u2019 s paying attention to what they \u2019 re doing , \u201d she said .\nWexler and Stephen Wachtler , a manager at Cleargate and Fillakit , \u201c were telling us , \u2018 Yeah , we got ta have four bins by lunch , \u2019 \u201d Green said . \u201c \u2018 We got ta have 10 bins before you leave at 5 o \u2019 clock . Work faster , work faster . \u2019 \u201d\nGreen said that few employees at the company had backgrounds in science or medicine . In May , during Fillakit \u2019 s first week of operations , the company did not provide workers with face masks , she said , raising concerns that fluid from their noses and mouths could land inside the tubes .

He did not respond to requests for comment .\n\u201c I kind of said to Stephen , \u2018 Is this supposed to be , like , clean technique , or sterile technique or what ? \u2019 \u201d Hardy said . \u201c He \u2019 s like : \u2018 No , it \u2019 s fine . It \u2019 s fine what you \u2019 re doing because they \u2019 re just testing for COVID , and so if there \u2019 s any other bacteria or viruses in there then it \u2019 s not going to show up . \u2019 \u201d\nThat \u2019 s not true , according to Vjollca Konjufca , an associate professor of microbiology at Southern Illinois University .
