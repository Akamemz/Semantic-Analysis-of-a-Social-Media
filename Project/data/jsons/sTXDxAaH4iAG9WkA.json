    "content": "Congress careened over the edge of the fiscal cliff at midnight , but a solution was in the offing after the Senate voted early Tuesday to approve a deal that combined tax-rate hikes and new stimulus spending , along with a two-month delay of automatic spending cuts .\nDemocrats and Republicans linked arms and powered the bill through the Senate on an overwhelming 89-8 vote , sending the measure over to the House , where a final showdown looms , and where it could have a more difficult path .\nSen. Mitch McConnell said it was the best bill that could be written .\n\u201c The president wanted tax increases , but thanks to this imperfect agreement , 99 percent of my constituents won \u2019 t be hit by those hikes , \u201d the Kentucky Republican said just ahead of the vote , which didn \u2019 t end until after 2 a.m. Tuesday morning .\nAn early estimate of the tax provisions found the bill amounted to a nearly $ 4 trillion tax cut when calculated over the next decade \u2014 all of which will be added onto the deficit .\nHouse Republican leaders released a statement saying they are still considering whether to try to amend the deal or put it up for a vote as-in , and said those decisions \u201c will not be made until House members \u2014 and the American people \u2014 have been able to review the legislation . \u201d\nThe White House and Mr. McConnell , the top Republican negotiator , settled on the outlines Monday evening , and Vice President Joseph R.

Dianne Feinstein , California Democrat .\nSome Democrats though , backed by liberal pressure groups , said their leaders caved on too many key issues . AFL-CIO President Richard L. Trumka tweeted that the deal \u201c set the stage for further destabilizing hostage taking from Rs in the form of another debt ceiling crisis & another sequester crisis . \u201d\nThe final sticking point was over how to postpone at least two months of those automatic spending cuts , or sequesters , scheduled to happen Wednesday .\nTax rates technically rose to their Clinton-era rates as the clock struck the new year , though taxpayers won \u2019 t see an immediate change . Still , unless Congress acts soon , the government will begin to withhold more money from future paychecks to reflect the higher rates , which will average about $ 3,500 per taxpayer in 2013 .\nIn the absence of a deal , President Obama also is required to begin imposing the $ 110 billion in automatic spending cuts Wednesday .\n\u201c This is disgusting , and everybody involved should be embarrassed , \u201d said Rep.
