Even if the Senate had passed the bill Tuesday , hints are mounting that President Barack Obama has hardened his stance against the $ 8 billion project and would veto any legislation greenlighting it , whether it comes from the current Democratic Senate or next year \u2019 s Republican Senate .\nThe past two weeks offer the strongest evidence to date that Obama may reject the Canada-to-Texas oil pipeline : He made a groundbreaking global warming deal with China \u2014 the latest sign that he is building a serious climate change legacy .

And he has lost much of the political urgency for considering the pipeline \u2014 the most vulnerable red-state Democrats lost on Election Day , so there \u2019 s less reason to cater to endangered centrists begging for a \u201c yes \u201d vote on Keystone .\nObama \u2019 s former aides , and others closely following the six-years-and-running Keystone drama , insist he still has plenty of wiggle room to rule either way when he finally renders a verdict , which could come in early 2015 .
