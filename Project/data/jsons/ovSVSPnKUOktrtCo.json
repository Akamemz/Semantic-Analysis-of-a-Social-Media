Orrin Hatch , R-Utah , who supports those states .\nBut the White House contends the president \u2019 s authority is clear , and the policies humane and reasonable . Obama has promoted his program as a plan to `` prioritize deporting felons not families . ''\nIt \u2019 s a case that will be closely watched in an election season where Republican front-runner Donald Trump has made immigration enforcement a centerpiece of his campaign . The outcome also could have considerable bearing on Obama \u2019 s legacy , potentially determining whether his lame-duck bid to go around Congress is upheld or ruled an overreach .\nAt issue Monday is whether as many as 5 million illegal immigrants can be spared deportation -- including those who entered the U.S. as children , and the parents of citizens or legal residents . The programs -- known as Deferred Action for Parents of American Citizens and Permanent Residents ( DAPA ) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) -- effectively went around the Republican-led Congress .\nOpponents , including 26 states and GOP members of Congress , say the plan exceeds constitutional power .\nA federal appeals court earlier had struck down DAPA , which has yet to go fully into effect . The Justice Department then asked the high court for a final review , in what could be a key test of Obama 's executive powers his last year in office .\nThe decision to review the case was welcome on both sides of the aisle .\n`` The Constitution vests legislative authority in Congress , not the president , \u201d said Hatch , urging the justices to rule against the administration .\nBut the White House voiced confidence the policies would be upheld .\n`` Like millions of families across this country -- immigrants who want to be held accountable , to work on the books , to pay taxes , and to contribute to our society openly and honestly -- we are pleased that the Supreme Court has decided to review the immigration case , '' spokeswoman Brandi Hoffine said .\nThe issue of illegal immigration has taken a center-stage role in the Republican primary battle , as Trump calls for a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico and candidates spar over who is toughest on the issue .\nThe immigrants who would benefit from the Obama administration 's plan are mainly parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents .
