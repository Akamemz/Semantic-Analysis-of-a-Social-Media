    "content": "South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg listens during the Democratic presidential candidates debate in Westerville , Ohio October 15 , 2019 . ( Shannon Stapleton/Reuters )\nThe October Democratic presidential-primary debate finally brought a genuine surprise , in that a pair of second-tier candidates who were in danger of being forgotten woke up , smelled the coffee , and brought their A-games : Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg . Considering how other second-tier candidates have turned in good performances in past months and seen little movement in the polls , this may not be a turning point in the race for either candidate . But in a way-too-long , often-boring debate that was stuck in the middle of an otherwise jam-packed news environment , Klobuchar and Buttigieg managed to stand out .\nWhere has this Klobuchar been all this campaign ? She was lively , common-sense , and pugnacious , particularly with Warren . Most of the other candidates are now in the state where they \u2019 re terrified of telling any primary voters anything they don \u2019 t want to hear , so they promise all things to all people , and that none of it will require any sacrifices or offsets . The corny humor and jokes about nagging her daughter would probably work in a general-election battle in the Midwest . And when Klobuchar went after Warren , you would have thought the Massachusetts senator was a staffer who had fouled up Klobuchar \u2019 s lunch .\nButtigieg has always turned in well-prepared performances ; if his previous nights had any problem , it was that they were smooth to the point of slickness ; he still has that vibe of listening to a presentation from McKinsey Consulting . But if tonight was the pressure night for most of the second tier , with other candidates eager to promise the moon , Buttigieg seemed like the relaxed voice of reason . He also appears to be the lone candidate in these debates to tangle with Tulsi Gabbard , veteran against veteran on the issue of the Middle East and national security , and live to tell the tale . Every candidate tries to tell personal stories about what shaped their values , but Buttigieg does this better than most with his discussion of growing up in South Bend and serving in Afghanistan .\nTonight , most of the rest of the field took shots at Elizabeth Warren , a subtle shift of strategy that effectively declared she \u2019 s now the de facto front-runner . Warren seems convinced that she can get all the way to Election Day without saying that her health-care plan would require raising taxes on the middle class . Warren has probably one of the better defenses in response to the attacks \u2014 she largely ignores the criticism and just reiterates her argument more emphatically . You get the feeling that the other candidates get irritated when Warren makes it sound like she \u2019 s the only candidate willing to take the tough stands . \u201c Even the billionaire isn \u2019 t standing up for billionaires , \u201d Klobuchar noted to her , one of the night \u2019 s rare genuinely funny lines , referring to Tom Steyer .\nWarren probably won \u2019 t lose much ground because of tonight , but this is the treatment she can expect from here on out .\nJoe Biden had a relatively quiet night , but when you \u2019 re still arguably the front-runner , maybe that \u2019 s okay . He didn \u2019 t handle an early question about Hunter Biden well , focusing on his usual high dudgeon about President Trump criticizing his family and adding , \u201c My son made a judgment . I \u2019 m proud of the judgment he made. \u201d Hunter Biden earlier in the day said \u201c In retrospect , look , I think it was poor judgment on my part . \u201d\nBut Biden \u2019 s really lost a step since he departed the vice presidency . His answers often devolve into word salad \u2013 less a sign that he \u2019 s mentally losing it than the fact that you can see him jumping from one point to the next without finishing the first one : \u201c No , look , demonizing wealth \u2014 what I talked about is how you get things done . And the way to get things done is take a look at the tax code right now . The idea \u2014 we have to start rewarding work , not just wealth . I would eliminate the capital gains tax \u2014 I would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate , of 39.5 percent . I would double it , because guess what ? Why in God \u2019 s name should someone who \u2019 s clipping coupons in the stock market make \u2014 in fact , pay a lower tax rate than someone who , in fact , is \u2014 like I said \u2014 the \u2014 a schoolteacher and a firefighter ? It \u2019 s ridiculous . And they pay a lower tax . \u201d\nEverybody \u2019 s glad to see Bernie Sanders upright and seemingly well , and in fact he was pretty feisty and impassioned and . . . well , his usual loud self , only a few weeks after having a heart attack and surgery to implant a stent . I suppose that \u2019 s most of what he can do to reassure the public \u2014 although making his doctors more available to answer questions would be nice . But you wonder how many people at home were watching him and wondering if , God forbid , one day between now and Election Day he would need another emergency trip to a hospital .\nThanks to Saturday Night Live , now every time Kamala Harris uncorks or reuses a rehearsed line , like , \u201c I have looked at more autopsy photos than I care to tell you , and I \u2019 m done , \u201d I just picture Maya Rudolph turning to the camera and declaring : \u201c Kamala .
