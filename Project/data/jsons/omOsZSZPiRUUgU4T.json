    "content": "We told you that this race was looking shaky for Republicans last week , and we were n't kidding . Pending a possible recount , Democrat Conor Lamb has likely won the special election in Pennsylvania 's 18th Congressional District by an extremely thin margin -- but no matter what the final tally looks like , even if the apparent victor somehow flips , the GOP can not be feeling good about how this one shook out . Here are my top three lessons coming out of Tuesday night :\n( 1 ) The GOP should be worried about November . There are multiple factors at play here : History cuts against the president 's party in midterm elections in general , which can not be ignored The president 's approval rating is in the low 40 's , which is not good , especially considering how well the economy is doing . And one side 's base is more fired up than the other . Last year , Republicans had won five straight contested special elections in which Democrats were seeking to flip a seat . That streak ended in the Alabama Senate race , which could have been written off as a perfect storm for Democrats . This one can not be written off . This has been a very Republican district :\n2016 House : Murphy unopposed https : //t.co/HQCpzLEEHD \u2014 Carrie Dann ( @ CarrieNBCNews ) March 12 , 2018\nIt 's true that ugly sex scandals do n't typically benefit the incumbent party , but under normal circumstances , this should have been a relatively easy hold for Republicans . The fact that it was a nail biter in the first place was a red flag for the GOP . Democrats need to net 24 seats to win back the House this fall . There are 23 lower chamber seats represented by Republicans in districts carried by Hillary Clinton in 2016 . Those are the 'low hanging fruit ' pickup opportunities for Democrats . On paper , PA-18 was a pretty darned safe R seat . Until it was n't . Last night is a prime example of why the opposition party is feeling pretty bullish about its chances to put a ton of seats in play -- especially if this type of intensity gap does n't close . The president could n't pull the Republican candidate over the top in the heart of rust belt `` Trump country . '' That 's a glaring concern , as is the fact that Republicans and affiliated groups pulled out all the stops to save this seat . What , if anything , can re-engage the GOP base ? It 's tough to say , but this might be one of the only valid possibilities . You simply can not pretend these trends do n't exist :\nIn the seven special elections held in 2017 , the average shift from 2016 results was D+16 .

A few weeks ago , some well-connected Republicans told me that Rick Saccone was proving to be a nice enough guy , but a very underwhelming candidate .

Even though Team Red heavily outspent Team Blue in the race , Lamb got a deep discount under election laws , compared to national organizations , allowing him to achieve a more level playing field than the raw dollars suggest . He also campaigned as a more traditional blue dog , professing his opposition to abortion ( though his actual legal stance is quite extreme , especially in this pro-life area ) , giving a thumbs-down to a $ 15 federal minimum wage , opposing single payer healthcare , and strongly backing the Second Amendment -- including coming out against any form of an assault weapons ban :\nLamb , the Democrat , opposed an assault weapons ban after Parkland . \u201c The emotions that a lot of us are feeling right now are very raw because we know that there \u2019 s not one thing we can do with the stroke of a pen or one thing you can ban. \u201d https : //t.co/9eKhmQs1Lp \u2014 Matt Stoller ( @ matthewstoller ) March 1 , 2018\nThe Democrats ran exactly the sort of candidate they needed to in this district to have a shot at winning .
