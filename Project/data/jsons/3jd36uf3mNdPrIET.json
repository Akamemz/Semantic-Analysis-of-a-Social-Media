And though the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , which has been stung by overzealous predictions in past years , won \u2019 t say outright that the majority is in play , the party is clearly thinking about it .\nDemocrats already had reasonable odds of flipping a dozen or so House seats . But DCCC Chairman Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n recently started highlighting \u201c reach \u201d districts , like those of Rep. John Mica in Florida and Rep. Steve Knight in California , that broaden Democrats \u2019 target list enough to take back the chamber \u2014 if local candidates can take advantage of the sudden opportunity .
