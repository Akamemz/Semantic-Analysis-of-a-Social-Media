    "content": "The State Department has started enforcing a new directive from the Trump administration that restricts visas for the same-sex partners of diplomats and other staff of U.S.-based international organizations like the United Nations .\nThe new policy reverses a 2009 procedure put in place by then-Secretary of Sate Hillary Clinton that allowed same-sex partners to obtain a G-4 or spousal visa . The new policy only allows entry into the United States if the partners are legally married .\n`` Effective immediately , U.S. Embassies and Consulates will adjudicate visa applications that are based on a same-sex marriage in the same way that we adjudicate applications for opposite gender spouses , '' the State Department said on its website .\nDiplomats with same-sex partners will have until the end of the year to get married or their partners will be sent home at the beginning of 2019 .\nThe change poses a problem for some same-sex couples who are not legally allowed to marry in their home country . Gay marriage is only legal in about 10 percent of the countries in the United Nations .\n`` The change in policy reflects the Department 's goal to help ensure and promote equal treatment , consistent with the Department 's policies regarding opposite-sex couples and derivative eligibility for visas in other visa categories , '' a State spokesperson in a statement .\nAlfonso Nam , president of UN-GLOBE , a group that advocates on behalf of the U.N. 's LGBTI employees , told The Washington Blade that the new rule would `` have a chilling effect on all couples in the United States under a U.N.-sponsored visa who are in legal unions other than marriage . ''\nNam , during a telephone interview with Fox News , said the new rule puts people slated to start assignments in New York at a greater risk in their home countries .\n`` It 's not an option to get married , '' he said , adding that in some countries coming out not only puts the person in danger but also their families .\nDavid Pressman , former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Security Council in the Obama administration , slammed the rule reversal because the U.N. is `` composed of probably one of the most diverse workforces of any organization in the world . ''\n`` If that 's how you advance equality between same-sex and opposite sex partners , then we have an enormous problem on our hands , '' he told NBC News . He went on to describe the policy as a `` creative and cynical way to use the expansion of equality at home to vindictively target same-sex couples abroad .
