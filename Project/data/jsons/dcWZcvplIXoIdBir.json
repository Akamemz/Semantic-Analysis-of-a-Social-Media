    "content": "The real fake-out is that the Left is capable of honestly policing fake news .\nLast week , Harvard released a new research guide on \u201c fake news . \u201d\n\u201c Fake news , \u201d of course , is the source of all evil , according to the Left . It \u2019 s only thanks to lies that Donald Trump was elected ! Instead of targeting stories that are completely false , however , the Left applies the label of \u201c fake news \u201d to outlets that report factual stories but draw political conclusions from them \u2014 in other words , they call everything with which they disagree \u201c fake news . \u201d\nWhich means that their talk of \u201c fake news \u201d is actually fake news .\nOf course , the largest \u201c fake news \u201d item of all is that \u201c objective \u201d news sources aren \u2019 t biased in their coverage . They obviously are , and it \u2019 s why conservatives have warmed to President Trump \u2019 s labeling left-leaning outlets such as CNN \u201c fake news \u201d even if CNN isn \u2019 t actually reporting anything factually false but merely drawing convenient leftist inferences from overblown coverage of core facts .\nNonetheless , the Harvard guide , written by \u201c social justice \u201d professor Melissa Zimdars of Merrimack College , purports to compile a handy-dandy list of fake-news sites to avoid . The list provides ten different ways to label the stories on such sites :\n\u2010proceed with caution ( \u201c sources that may be reliable but whose contents require further verification \u201d )\nTwo other indicators are used for leftist sites that meet Zimdars \u2019 s politically correct standards :\n\u2010credible ( \u201c sources that circulate news and information in a manner consistent with traditional and ethical practices in journalism \u201d )\nSo , for example , AlterNet.org , a far-left site , is labeled \u201c political \u201d and \u201c credible. \u201d Here \u2019 s one of their top headlines as I write this , by one John Feffer : \u201c The Trump Dystopian Nightmare : Nuclear War , Climate Change , and a Clash of Civilizations Are All on the Horizon. \u201d \u2588\u2588\u2588 is labeled unknown . The website I run , the Daily Wire , is labeled with \u201c extreme bias , \u201d as is the Daily Signal , the website of the Heritage Foundation , as well as the Drudge Report , which is essentially a linker site . The Daily Caller is called \u201c political , \u201d \u201c clickbait , \u201d and \u201c unreliable. \u201d The Blaze is called \u201c political \u201d and \u201c clickbait. \u201d The list doesn \u2019 t mention Barack Obama \u2019 s favorite outlet , Vox ; it doesn \u2019 t mention Slate or Salon , either .\nEvery outlet has its bias . We \u2019 re all better off admitting our bias openly rather than slathering facts in opinions and then conflating the two .\nNo wonder conservatives don \u2019 t trust the media \u2014 or the supposed media police . They \u2019 re too busy upholding the myth of mainstream-media objectivity to be concerned with the truth , which is that every outlet has its bias , and that we \u2019 re all better off admitting our bias openly rather than slathering facts in opinions and then conflating the two . I \u2019 ll proudly state that \u2588\u2588\u2588 and the Daily Wire are more honest than CNN ; both outlets have an editorial point of view reflected in their content , but neither mistakes news for opinion or opinion for news . The supposedly objective outlets , by hiding behind the fa\u00e7ade of that faux objectivity , constantly conflate their opinions with their news .\nHere \u2019 s the reality : We \u2019 re not all going to be able to agree on narrative . But we should strive to find the facts we can discuss together .\nSo , how do we identify the facts ? Here are a few tips for determining reliability of information \u2014 tips that we all ( including me ) fail to use consistently but that could prove handy :\n1 ) Locate the information intersection . If we view news coverage from various sides of the aisle as lines on a grid , the point where they converge \u2014 the common point of coverage \u2013 gives us the facts . So long as an outlet reports those facts , it \u2019 s not fake news . It \u2019 s just opinion journalism , unless it obviously treats opinions as facts . So if Huffington Post and \u2588\u2588\u2588 report the same underlying facts but disagree about the ramifications , we can at least identify the underlying facts worth discussing . This does mean that you should survey the literature \u2014 and that you should move outside your Facebook feed from time to time .\n2 ) Wait 24 hours to believe supremely controversial claims . The Twitter/Facebook news cycle favors the people who are the first on a story , but exclusivity and speed often trump reliability . That \u2019 s why veteran Twitter watchers almost never tweet out early reports from shooting scenes : The information from the ground evolves over time . Most of us on Twitter fall victim to this from time to time . \u201c Too good to check \u201d sometimes overrides better judgment .\n3 ) Anonymous sources are anonymous sources . Don \u2019 t put tons of weight on anonymous sources unless an organization with a history of caution has a bunch of them claiming the same thing . This also means that when one anonymous source denies an allegation from another anonymous source , you shouldn \u2019 t just believe the anonymous source you like .\n4 ) Outlets that make corrections are more reliable . If an outlet issues corrections , it is more likely to be more reliable than others . Outlets that double down after they \u2019 ve been proved wrong are either stubbornly right or \u2014 far more likely \u2014 stubbornly wrong . That doesn \u2019 t mean that outlets that constantly back down are better than those that don \u2019 t . It means that outlets that never back down are probably willing to fib to you .\n5 ) Consider the ideology . Let \u2019 s say a site leans right but will print information that counters its prevailing orthodoxy or will tolerate voices of dissent within a band of the spectrum . It \u2019 s more likely that such a site will treat information with respect , since the ideology doesn \u2019 t trump the facts . It \u2019 s dangerous when a site decides to quash news or rewrite news based on the ramifications of the news .\n6 ) Read the whole article . Don \u2019 t just read the headline . We all read the headlines for shorthand , but all too often the real point of an article is buried in paragraph 19 , as all the mainstream outlets understand ( which is why , as good little leftists , they bury all the exonerating information about Trump-Russia connections deep in their articles ) . More complexity in information makes it more difficult to digest and tempts us to filter out new or conflicting info , but it also makes our information more accurate .\nAll in all , don \u2019 t believe that everything the Left labels \u201c fake news \u201d is fake news . It \u2019 s far more likely that the real fake news is that the Left is capable of policing fake news honestly , rather than merely determining that sources they hate must be ruled out of the news realm entirely .",
