    "content": "Last month , a photographer named Ellen Shub died , near Boston , at the age of seventy-three . I had got to know Shub in the nineteen-eighties , when I worked for gay and lesbian publications . At that time , she was already well known as a chronicler of social protest\u2014a role that she continued to perform up until she unexpectedly fell ill , just weeks before she died . Many of her pictures were compositionally similar\u2014frontal , focussed on one person and one sign . In 1975 , she took a picture of a woman holding a placard that said \u201c No more back room back alley abortions. \u201d In 1981 , at a Boston rally for the Equal Rights Amendment , she photographed a woman who held a sign on which she had pasted \u201c 59c \u201d \u2014the amount of money , it was said , that a woman made for every dollar earned by a man . In 2004 , when the Republican National Convention was held in New York , Shub took a picture of a protester with a large sheet of cardboard printed with the words \u201c \u2018 Dissent is the highest form of patriotism \u2019 \u2014Thomas Jefferson. \u201d In 2014 , at a rally in Boston , she photographed a young man holding one that said \u201c # Icantbreathe. \u201d There were many more , and , in each case , the message of the photograph was the message of the sign .\nShub \u2019 s intention in taking such text-centric pictures was clear : she was creating a historical record . Her medium was photographs published in the alternative media and movement media : gay and lesbian newspapers , feminist newspapers , and city weeklies . If mainstream journalism likes to think of itself as the \u201c first rough draft of history , \u201d and indeed forms much of the record that historians use to create more lasting narratives , then the kind of papers to which Shub contributed serve as amendments to this story , a record of what was also said , also written , and also seen . Shub spent decades attending all sorts of protests in all kinds of weather , to insure that\u2014even if contemporary television viewers were unlikely to know it\u2014future generations could learn that we were here and we held signs .\nI thought of Shub on Friday , when the Washington Post reported that the National Archives had altered the signs on a photograph from the 2017 Women \u2019 s March on Washington . On the photograph in question , the word \u201c Trump \u201d was blurred on a sign that originally read \u201c God Hates Trump. \u201d In other signs in the same picture , the words \u201c vagina \u201d and \u201c pussy \u201d disappeared .\nIn response to the Post \u2019 s initial inquiry , the Archives offered two arguments and one excuse . The excuse was that the altered photograph was not part of a current exhibition at the Archives , tracing a hundred years of the suffragist movement , but merely a display that advertised the show . Still , the display would have become part of the Archives \u2019 record\u2014indeed , a part of the record that would have been seen more widely than the exhibition itself . The arguments were that the words referring to female anatomy may strike visitors as \u201c inappropriate \u201d and , separately , that the Archives are a \u201c non-partisan , non-political federal agency. \u201d The word \u201c non-partisan \u201d seemed to be used to mean \u201c in willful denial of the existence of political opinion. \u201d The word \u201c non-political \u201d seemed to mean that the job of the Archives is to create a historical record that obliterates politics . ( On Saturday , within twenty-four hours of the publication of the Post story , the Archives removed the display photograph and posted a note of apology , which began , \u201c We made a mistake . \u201d )\nThe altered photograph , from the 2017 Women \u2019 s March on Washington , on display at the National Archives Research Center , on January 17th .
