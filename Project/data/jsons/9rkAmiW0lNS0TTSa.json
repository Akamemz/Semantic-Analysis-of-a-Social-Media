'' `` We thought we would n't have a problem if we went to New York . We could just be ourselves , '' she recalled .\n`` That 's not true , '' interjected her friend Terrain Dandridge . `` That 's where it happened to us . ''\n`` Well , '' Renata said , amending her comment , `` that 's where we thought we 'd be safe . ''\nThe West Village has historically been known as a safe haven for LGBTQ people . People travel from various parts of New York and New Jersey to be in the neighborhood , walk around without feeling judged or to worry that their sexual orientation or gender identity will lead to an attack . But , eight years ago , seven young women learned that safety , even in a haven like the West Village , is never guaranteed .\nOn August 18 , 2006 , Renata Hill , Terrain Dandridge and five of their friends decided to go to the Village . All were young , black and lesbian . Outside the Independent Film Center ( IFC ) , a small theater showing independent films , they were harassed by a man named Duane Buckle . When they told him they were gay , he threatened them with rape and physically attacked them . He threw his lit cigarette at them , ripped the hair from one woman 's head and choked another woman .\nThe seven women defended themselves and , at some point during the four-minute fight , were assisted by two unknown men . As Buckle attempted to choke Renata , her friend Patreese Johnson stabbed him with a pen knife . By the time the police arrived , the men who had jumped to the women 's defense had left the scene . Buckle was taken to the hospital , where he stated that men had attacked him , and released a few days later . The women were arrested , taken to the precinct and charged with gang assault , assault and attempted murder .\nNone of the women had prior records or histories of police involvement . Nevertheless , they were held without bail at Rikers Island while awaiting trial . Facing the possibility of twenty-five year sentences , three women accepted plea bargains and served six months . The remaining four -- Venice Brown , Terrain Dandridge , Renata Hill and Patreese Johnson -- pled not guilty and became known as the New Jersey Four . They were convicted and received sentences ranging from three-and-a-half to eleven years in prison .\nNone had ever been involved in a gang , yet they charged with and convicted of gang assault . Their claims of self-defense were ignored .\nOut in the Night , a film by blair dorosh-walther released by the Fire This Time The Film LLC , examines how race , sexual orientation and gender violence affect ideas about safety and self-defense , and how each shaped the fates of the New Jersey Four . What happens when women refuse to accept street harassment or homophobic violence ? What happens when these women happen to be black women ?\nThe documentary places the case of the New Jersey Four in a larger pattern of violence against black people and the legal system 's treatment of their claims to self-defense . It draws parallels between the case of the New Jersey Four with more recent cases involving attacks on black people , such as Trayvon Martin , CeCe McDonald and Marissa Alexander . All three were attacked , all three fought back , and all three were treated as if they were the aggressors by the police and court systems . Although Trayvon Martin was the person killed , the media and legal system treated him as if he 'd been the assailant , subjecting his body to drug testing and speculating about his recent school suspension and cellphone photos as if these justified his killing . McDonald and Alexander 's claims of self-defense were likewise rejected by the courts , and they were both demonized in the media .\nSimilarly , when the seven women were initially arrested in 2006 , news headlines labeled them a `` lesbian wolf pack '' and `` killer lesbians . '' Meanwhile , The New York Times stated that `` Man is Stabbed in Attack After Admiring a Stranger . '' Evening news segments added more fuel with reports of lesbian gangs ( alternately labeled Gays Taking Over and Dykes Taking Over ) raping young girls .\nAttorneys of the New Jersey Four note that the fear-mongering around the case had even reached the courtroom . `` The district attorney made certain decisions , like the charges and holding them without bail , '' noted Susan Tipograph , one of the two trial attorneys for Hill . Those charges influence perceptions even before evidence can be presented , agreed Lori Cohen , Tipograph 's co-counsel . `` There are some charges that , when you hear them , it 's really hard to get below them to what actually happened . '' The charges scared at least one juror who , Tipograph remembered , sent his wife out of town during the course of the trial .\n`` Out in the Night '' also challenges viewers to think about the constant threats ( and realities of ) harassment and violence against LGBTQ people , particularly LGBTQ people of color . The film recounts the 2003 murder of Sakia Gunn , a fifteen-year-old high school student and black lesbian . Gunn and her friends had been returning from New York City 's West Village . As they waited for the bus in downtown Newark , they were propositioned by two black men . When the women told them that they were lesbians , the men attacked . One of the men stabbed Gunn in the chest . Her friends flagged down a taxi and took her to the hospital , where she died . The night they were attacked three years later , Patreese recalled , she remembered Gunn and wondered if the same thing would happen to her .\nGunn 's death is neither an anomaly nor is it a relic of the ( not-too-distant ) past . In 2011 , CeCe McDonald , a twenty-three-year-old black woman , faced the same scenario . Walking down a Minneapolis street with her friends , McDonald was first verbally harassed and then physically attacked by people standing outside a bar . One woman smashed glass into McDonald 's face , slicing into her cheek . The man who had instigated the harassment was stabbed during the attack . He was taken to the hospital , where he later died . McDonald was arrested and charged with second-degree murder . The woman who smashed glass into her face was neither arrested nor charged .\nDuring pre-trial motions , the judge ruled against McDonald 's ability to introduce evidence showing that the attack against her was motivated by her race and gender identity : Both Schmitz 's swastika and his three previous convictions for violent assault were ruled inadmissible . The judge also refused to allow an expert witness to testify about the pervasive and systemic violence faced by trans people on a daily basis . Facing the possibility of twenty to forty years in prison and a hostile court , McDonald pled guilty to second-degree manslaughter due to negligence and was sentenced to forty-one months in prison . She was released this past January .\nIn August 2013 twenty-one-year-old Islan Nettles died after being attacked on a New York City street . While accounts vary as to whether she was flirting with or had been catcalled by 20-year-old Paris Wilson , all agree that , after realizing that she was trans , Wilson beat her unconscious . She died four days later at the hospital . Wilson was originally charged with three counts of misdemeanor assault and released on $ 2000 bail . A few months later , when another man claimed that he had attacked Nettles but was too drunk to remember what had happened , the district attorney dropped the charge altogether , declining to prosecute either .\nWhy did the legal system treat the death of a young trans woman less seriously than a non-fatal stabbing with a pen knife ?
