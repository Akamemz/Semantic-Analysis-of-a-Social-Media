It targets people who have had good jobs but have lost bargaining power in a global economy .\nPolls show Mr. Trump resonates most strongly with the growing precarious middle \u2013 those whose parents were firmly middle class but now find themselves in need and at least nearing the margins of poverty .\nThe result is a percolating conversation among Republicans about how to shore up America \u2019 s safety net . To Mr. Ryan , now speaker of the House , that means moving federal money out of some welfare programs and into others he says are more effective , such as the Earned Income Tax Credit ( EITC ) .\nTo Democrats and some advocates for the poor , that sounds like robbing from one class of the poor to give to another \u2013 perhaps for electoral advantage .\nYet the shift in Republican thinking was noted by none other than President Obama in his State of the Union address .\n\u201c Speaker Ryan has talked about his interest in tackling poverty , \u201d he said . \u201c I \u2019 d welcome a serious discussion about strategies we can all support\u2026 \u201d\nWhether they can agree on any reforms is an open question .
