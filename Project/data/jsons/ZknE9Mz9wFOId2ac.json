    "content": "President Barack Obama attends a news conference at the White House , November 14 , 2016 . ( Jonathan Ernst/Reuters )\nThe group had been on a list of terrorist funders for a decade when a government agency specifically approved funding for it .\nThe Middle East Forum has discovered that the Obama administration approved a grant of $ 200,000 of taxpayer money to an al-Qaeda affiliate in Sudan \u2014 a decade after the U.S. Treasury designated it as a terrorist-financing organization . More stunningly , government officials specifically authorized the release of at least $ 115,000 of this grant even after learning that it was a designated terror organization .\nThe story began in October 2004 , when the U.S. Treasury Department \u2019 s Office of Foreign Assets Control ( OFAC ) designated the Khartoum-based Islamic Relief Agency ( ISRA ) , also known as the Islamic African Relief Agency ( IARA ) , as a terror-financing organization . It did so because of ISRA \u2019 s links to Osama bin Laden and his organization Maktab al-Khidamat ( MK ) , the precursor of al-Qaeda .\nAccording to the U.S. Treasury , in 1997 ISRA established formal cooperation with MK . By 2000 , ISRA had raised $ 5 million for bin Laden \u2019 s group . The Treasury Department notes that ISRA officials even sought to help \u201c relocate [ bin Laden ] to secure safe harbor for him. \u201d It further reports that ISRA raised funds in 2003 in Western Europe specifically earmarked for Hamas suicide bombings .\nThe 2004 designation included all of ISRA \u2019 s branches , including a U.S. office called the Islamic American Relief Agency ( IARA-USA ) . Eventually it became known that this American branch had illegally transferred over $ 1.2 million to Iraqi insurgents and other terror groups , including , reportedly , the Afghan terrorist Gulbuddin Hekmatyar . In 2010 , the executive director of IARA-USA and a board member pled guilty to money-laundering , theft of public funds , conspiracy , and several other charges .\nISRA \u2019 s influence also spread to Washington . Former U.S. congressman Mark Siljander ( R. , Mich. ) pled guilty in 2010 to obstruction of justice and acting as an unregistered foreign agent after prosecutors found that IARA-USA had paid him $ 75,000 \u2014 using misappropriated USAID grant money \u2014 to lobby the government , in an attempt to remove the charity from the government \u2019 s terror list .\nDespite this well-documented history , the U.S. Agency for International Development ( USAID ) in July 2014 awarded $ 723,405 to World Vision Inc. , an international evangelical charity , to \u201c improve water , sanitation and hygiene and to increase food security in Sudan \u2019 s Blue Nile state. \u201d Of these funds , $ 200,000 was to be directed to a sub-grantee : ISRA .\nResponding to a Middle East Forum ( MEF ) inquiry , a USAID official explains that World Vision had alerted it in November 2014 to the likelihood of ISRA being on the terror list . USAID instructed World Vision to \u201c suspend all activities with ISRA \u201d and informed the State Department , OFAC , and USAID \u2019 s Office of the Inspector General . USAID and World Vision then waited for OFAC to confirm whether ISRA was designated or not .\nUSAID emails obtained by the Middle East Forum reveal that in January 2015 , World Vision was growing unhappy while waiting for OFAC \u2019 s assessment . Mark Smith , World Vision \u2019 s senior director of humanitarian and emergency affairs , wrote to USAID , stating that the Islamic Relief Agency \u201c had performed excellent work \u201d for World Vision in the past , and that \u201c putting contractual relationships in limbo for such a long period is putting a significant strain \u201d on World Vision \u2019 s relationship with the Sudanese regime . Smith also revealed that World Vision had submitted a notice to OFAC indicating its \u201c intention to restart work with [ ISRA ] and to transact with [ ISRA ] \u201d if OFAC did not respond within a week .\nWorld Vision \u2019 s statement stunned USAID officials , who complained that World Vision \u2019 s behavior \u201c doesn \u2019 t make sense. \u201d USAID official Daniel Holmberg emailed a colleague : \u201c If they actually said that they wanted to resume work with ISRA , while knowing that it was 99 % likely that ISRA was on the list then I am concerned about our partnership with them , and whether it should continue . \u201d\nOn January 23 , OFAC confirmed that ISRA was a sanctioned entity and denied World Vision \u201c a license to engage in transactions with [ ISRA ] . \u201d Mark Smith and World Vision \u2019 s country program director in Sudan expressed their disappointment , stating that they were in discussions with ISRA as well as the Sudanese regime \u2019 s Humanitarian Aid Commission , which regulates the activities of international charities in Sudan .\nDespite OFAC \u2019 s ruling , in February , World Vision wrote to OFAC and Obama-administration official Jeremy Konyndyk ( who then served as director of USAID \u2019 s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance ) to apply to OFAC for a new license from USAID to pay ISRA \u201c monies owed for work performed. \u201d According to Larry Meserve , USAID \u2019 s mission director for Sudan , World Vision argued that if they did not pay ISRA , \u201c their whole program will be jeopardized . \u201d\nWhile World Vision waited for a decision , on February 22 , a pro-regime Sudanese newspaper , Intibaha , reported that the Sudanese political leaders had requested that World Vision be expelled from Sudan \u2019 s Blue Nile state . USAID disaster operations specialist Joseph Wilkes and World Vision \u2019 s Mark Smith speculated that this was \u201c punishment \u201d for the cancellation of the grant with ISRA , which a USAID official noted is \u201c well connected with the [ Sudanese ] government . \u201d\nThen , incredibly , on May 7 , 2015 \u2014 after \u201c close collaboration and consultations with the Department of State \u201d \u2014 OFAC issued a license to a World Vision affiliate , World Vision International , authorizing \u201c a one-time transfer of approximately $ 125,000 to ISRA , \u201d of which \u201c $ 115,000 was for services performed under the sub-award with USAID \u201d and $ 10,000 was \u201c for an unrelated funding arrangement between Irish Aid and World Vision . \u201d\nAn unnamed World Vision official described the decision as a \u201c great relief as ISRA had become restive and had threatened legal action , which would have damaged our reputation and standing in Sudan. \u201d Senior USAID official Charles Wanjue wrote to colleagues : \u201c Good news and a great relief , really ! \u201d In August 2015 , USAID official Daniel Holmberg even told a State Department official that he had been approached by the executive director of ISRA , and requested guidance on helping ISRA remove itself from the U.S. government \u2019 s terror list .\nObama-administration officials knowingly approved the transfer of taxpayer dollars to an al-Qaeda affiliate , and not an obscure one but an enormous international network that was often in the headlines .\nHow was this prominent terror funder initially approved to receive American taxpayer funds ten years after it had been placed on the \u2018 Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons \u2019 terror list ?\nHow was this prominent terror funder initially approved to receive American taxpayer funds ten years after it had been placed on the \u201c Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons \u201d terror list ?\nExisting measures to prevent the payment of government monies to designated terrorist organizations include : first , a requirement that all grantees and sub-grantees of U.S.-government grants register for a Data Universal Numbering System ( DUNS ) number ; and second , a requirement that all government vendors register with the government \u2019 s System for Award Management ( SAM ) database .
