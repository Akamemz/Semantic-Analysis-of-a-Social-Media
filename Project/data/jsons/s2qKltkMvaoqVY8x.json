    "content": "It 's been a good week for Mitt Romney . The polls are up , he 's just off a two-day swing through Connecticut and New York where he hauled in big donors and hard money , and he swept the GOP primaries in Kentucky and Arkansas .\nOn Tuesday Texas will put him over the top and make him , formally and officially , the Republican nominee for president .\nNot everything worked\u2014his big education speech Wednesday was wan and pallid\u2014but he 's having a moment . In a telephone interview , he reflected on the campaign , tracing his candidacy 's upward momentum to an increased sense among voters that the country is on the wrong path and , perhaps , a growing sense that he 's proved himself : `` I can tell you that we went through those 37 or 38 contests and won the must-win states , and in some cases we started off 10 points behind . And we hustled , worked hard , and convinced the voters . '' This produced `` the kind of track record that people say , 'You know , I think if Mitt can keep that up , in November we 're going to see a new president . ' ''\nCandidates on a campaign van look out the window and see America go by . They meet with people , talk . I asked Mr. Romney the difference between the America he saw in 2008 and the one he sees now . `` A much higher degree of anxiety today . People much less confident in the security of their job , less confident in the prospects for their children . ''\nFour years ago , the economic downturn had n't occurred . `` In my primary , the central issue was Iraq . '' Now it is the economy .\nBefore rallies and town meetings , Mr. Romney always tries to have private , off-the-record meetings with voters . `` I sit down with five or six couples or individuals and just go around the table , and I ask them to tell me about their life . And the stories I hear suggest a degree of anxiety which is not reflected in the statistics . ''\nHe is struck , he said , by the number of people who are employed but in legitimate fear of being let go . He is struck by the number of people who 've made investments for their retirement\u2014real estate , 401 ( k ) s\u2014and seen them go down .\nHe keeps a campaign journal on his iPad : `` Now this is going to make my iPad a subject of potential theft ! '' He used to speak his entries , but now he types them on an attached keyboard . `` I 've kept up pretty well , actually . '' He writes every two or three days , so that 10 years from now he can `` remember what it was like , '' but also to capture `` the feelings\u2014the ups the downs , the people I meet and the sense I have about what 's going to happen . It 's kind of fun to go back and read , as Ann and I do from time to time . ''\nDoes he love politics\u2014the joy of it , the fight of it ? `` What I love are the political rallies and town meetings . I love the interchange with individuals that are probing and pushing . ''\nBut the game of politics ? `` I like competition , and I think the game is like a sport for old guys . I mean , you know , I ca n't compete in competitive sports very well , but I can compete in politics , and there 's the\u2014what was the old ABC 'Wide World of Sports ' slogan ? 'The thrill of victory and the agony of defeat . ' The only difference is victory is still a thrill , but I do n't feel agony in loss . ''\nDo you wake up in a good mood , or do you have to work your way into it ? `` Depends on the day . '' He laughs . `` Depends on the issue . The only time I 'm unhappy is if I 've done something that hurt the prospects for the success of our effort . ''\nWhen was the last time you woke up unhappy ? He says he does n't recall . Then : `` Sometimes you 're disappointed , but it 's mostly disappointment with myself that causes me to be most concerned . This for me is not my life , meaning I do n't have to win an election to feel good about myself . '' He 's achieved success in business `` beyond my wildest dreams . '' He 's `` hoping to make a contribution and go to Washington and go home when it 's over . . . . Who I am has long ago been determined by my relationship with the people I love , and with my success in my professional career . ''\nAll great political families have myths , stories they tell themselves about how history happened . The great story about Mr. Romney 's father , George , is that one word\u2014 '' brainwashed '' \u2014did in his presidential candidacy in 1968 . People have hypothesized that Mitt is careful with words and statements , that he edits his thoughts too severely , because of the power of that myth .\n`` I do n't think my father 's comment figures into my thinking at all , '' he says . It 's his own mistakes `` that make me want to kick myself in the seat of my pants , '' that `` cause me to try and be a little more careful in what I say . . . . I 've had a couple of those during the campaign , which have haunted me a little bit , but I 'm sure before this is over will haunt me a lot . ''\nAsked for an example , he mentions `` I like to be able to fire people . '' He meant , he says , those , such as health-insurance companies , that provide inadequate services . `` I have to think not only about what I say in a full sentence but what I say in a phrase . '' In the current media environment , `` you will be taken out of context , you 'll be clipped , and you 'll be battered with things you said . '' He says it is interesting that `` the media always says , 'Gosh , we just want you to be spontaneous , ' but at the same time if you say anything in the wrong order , you 're gon na be sorry ! ''\nWhat about historic parallelism\u2014the people who say , `` This election is 1980 all over again , '' or , `` No , it 's 1996 '' ? What year is it ?\n`` It 's 2012 . '' He laughs . History sometimes repeats `` its lessons , '' but `` history does not repeat itself identically . This is a different time than any other time before it .
