Shylock, the villain in Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cThe Merchant of Venice,\u201d is a Jewish moneylender who mercilessly demands a \u201cpound of flesh\u201d from the merchant who defaults on a loan\u2026Biden\u2019s slip came in a speech to the Legal Services Corporation\u2026In his remarks, the vice president described the experience of his son, Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden, who was deployed for one year in Iraq. \u2018People would come to him and talk about what was happening to them at home in terms of foreclosures, in terms of bad loans that were being \u2014 I mean, these Shylocks who took advantage of these women and men while overseas,\u2019 Biden said.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut he\u2019s cool with nuns, though - Des Moines [Iowa] Register: \u201cFor this Iowa visit, Joe Biden is hitching his wagon to a bus full of nuns. The vice president of the United States will help kick off a 10-state voter turnout tour for a liberal group called \u201cNuns on the Bus\u201d today with an outdoor event on the west terrace of the Iowa Capitol. For the nation\u2019s first Catholic vice president, this is a chance to attach himself with religious leaders who embrace a message on economic equality that syncs with his soul, his Iowa supporters say.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2018THE MEANS\u2019 RACES TO THE END\n\nHow do you write a political thriller that keeps reader interest but doesn\u2019t succumb to melodrama like \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d or \u201cScandal?\u201d Author Doug Brunt knows the answer. His new book, \u201cThe Means,\u201d is grounded in the realities of politics and life on the campaign trail and in office. But there is plenty of drama and enough twists to satisfy even a Mickey Spillane junkie. And sex. Boy howdy is there sex. If only the people in Washington were as attractive as Doug depicts them! You can watch Doug talk about the novel with his No.1 fan.\n\n\n\n[Ed. note: Yes, I did get a mention in the book, which, in an uncommon false note, far overstates my influence. And yes, it was my pleasure to spitball ideas with Doug. But I would have read it anyway. You should too.]\n\n\n\nLOUDER THAN THE SOUND OF ONE HAND CLAPPING\n\nKIRO: \u201cPeople who live near the Duoc Su Buddhist Monastery on 42nd Avenue South in Seattle\u2019s Othello neighborhood, have been complaining about noise\u2026 Monastery president William Lee [said] the monastery only gets loud about three times a year when special events are hosted at the location. \u2026 Neighbors disagree. They argue the noise has been constant even when the special events aren\u2019t on location. \u2018The noise is really bad there\u2019s been incidences where they have gongs and bells going and they had a gas powered leaf blower that was running,\u2019 said Pat Murakami, president of the South Seattle Crime Prevention Council. She\u2019s called 911 about the noise several times in the past few days\u2026 most of the neighbors say the noise stops by 10 p.m., Murakami says it\u2019s still way too loud. \u2018They\u2019ve had music blaring at concert levels,\u2019 said Murakami.\u201d\n\n\n\nAND NOW, A WORD FROM CHARLES\u2026\n\n\u201cEither the president wants not to do it, which appears to be the impression. . . . and the military wants to go ahead and do it, because it knows it\u2019s going to need to at some point. Or, Obama is very cleverly the one giving the good news, and he\u2019s having the generals go out and talk about the inevitable bad news, the ground troops. Or the third possibility is, these guys have no idea what they\u2019re saying or doing, and they can\u2019t agree on what\u2019s going on.\u201d \u2013 Charles Krauthammer on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d\n\n\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
