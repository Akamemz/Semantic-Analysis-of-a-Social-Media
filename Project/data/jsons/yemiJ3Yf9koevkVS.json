    "content": "Never let it be said that the Trump administration ca n't walk and chew gum at the same time . Even as the president 's minions work overtime to botch every single aspect of the federal response to the COVID-19 crisis and prepare to cover up the number of cases and the number of deaths in order to make his `` numbers '' look good , they still manage to find the time to complete the purge of Trump critics within the government and destroy all mechanisms for accountability .\nTrump 's forces have pretty much rendered the Congress impotent , going so far as to argue before the Supreme Court last week that not only should a sitting president be immune from any and all investigation and prosecution , he 's also immune from congressional oversight . It 's well within the realm of possibility that the right-wing majority on the court will see it their way \u2014 at least when it comes to Republican presidents . ( I would n't expect them to feel bound by their own precedents when it applies to Democrats . )\nOn Friday night , the administration announced the fourth firing in six weeks of an inspector general , State Department IG Steve Linick , in what the Washington Post has dubbed a `` slow-motion Friday Night Massacre . ''\nBack on April 3 , Trump fired intelligence community IG Michael Atkinson , in retaliation for his having done his job by passing on a whistleblower 's complaint to Congress about the president 's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky . That seems like another era of history now , but it did indeed lead to Trump 's impeachment . A week later he removed acting Defense Department Inspector General Glenn Fine , who had been tasked with overseeing the $ 2 trillion pandemic relief fund . He was replaced with a Trump loyalist .\nOn May 2 , acting Health and Human Services Inspector General Christi Grimm was removed after Trump learned about a report she wrote that found severe shortages of supplies and equipment in hospitals around the country . Trump told the press that Grimm 's report was wrong and accused her of being an Obama partisan , although she 'd been a career official for two decades under both Republican and Democratic administrations .\nThe latest is Linick , who had come under fire during the impeachment inquiry when he delivered to Congress some bizarre documents he 'd received from Rudy Giuliani about Marie Yovanovitch , who was then the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine . Again , Linick was only doing his job , but it was seen as an act of disloyalty to the king .\nLinick was spared from the purge until last week , perhaps because he 'd been critical of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's email practices , which no doubt pleased the president . It appears he finally went too far , however , and was investigating Secretary of State Mike Pompeo 's use of State Department personnel for personal use . By all accounts , Pompeo requested Linick be fired and Trump was happy to comply .\nConsidering the vast amount of corruption , graft and self-dealing by Trump and his cronies \u2014 even now , during the COVID-19 crisis \u2014 this scandal almost seems quaint . It brings back memories of the early days of the Trump presidency when half his cabinet members were behaving like members of Louis XIV 's inner circle , traveling in private planes at taxpayer expense and using staff as their personal valets .\nWho can forget former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt , who not only spent vast amounts on unnecessary travel , but was so paranoid he had his office soundproofed and demanded around-the-clock security , including 18 agents who cost the taxpayers millions of dollars ? Pruitt did n't even try to hide all that , but it nonetheless took months of blaring headlines before he was finally forced to spend more time with his family ( as the clich\u00e9 has it ) . Then there was HHS Secretary Tom Price , who finally resigned after multiple investigations into his use of private charter and military jets to travel around the country on your dim and mine . Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke likewise had to resign after it was revealed he too was bilking the treasury for extravagant travel expenses .\nOthers managed to survive , notably Trumpfamily members like Jared Kushner who used his position to pursue a business deal with a Chinese company with ties to the Beijing government , as well as some dubious Middle East dealings to help his family 's real estate business . HUD Secretary Ben Carson remains in his office doing God knows what , despite having been caught spending wildly on office furniture . Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin wriggled out of his own expensive travel scandal . And of course there 's the president himself , who has been promoting his own businesses and profiting from them the entire time he 's been in office .\nThe sheer magnitude of corruption in the Trump administration has been unprecedented and yet it all seems like a distant memory . One of Trump 's great gifts has been to offer up so much carnage , graft , incompetence and scandal that it 's hard to keep track of it all .\nPompeo is a different case . His scandal has to do with his wife Susan , to whom he is exceedingly devoted . Indeed , reports suggest she is constantly by his side constantly . When he was CIA director , there was reportedly consternation over the fact that Susan Pompeo commandeered office space at the agency 's headquarters in Langley , Virginia , and was `` assisted '' by CIA employees , who could have been forgiven for thinking they were expected to do whatever the director 's wife told them to . According to the Washington Post , Susan fashioned herself as the `` first lady of the CIA , '' which is n't actually a thing .\nFrom the beginning , there have been raised eyebrows in both the CIA and the State Department over Susan Pompeo 's extensive travel with her husband , which he has referred to as a `` force multiplier .
