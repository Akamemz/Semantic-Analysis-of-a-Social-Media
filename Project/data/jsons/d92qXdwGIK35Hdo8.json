In fact , there are indications that he is winning a lot .\nLet \u2019 s start with Tuesday \u2019 s primaries . In Florida , a fine , well-entrenched state Agriculture Commissioner and former U.S. Rep. Adam Putnam decisively lost the Republican gubernatorial primary to Rep. Ron DeSantis . The big boost for DeSantis came from President Trump \u2019 s endorsement and a Trump robocall to Florida Republicans .\nThe contest for governor of our third-most populous state shaped up even better for Republicans as a hard-left Bernie Sanders-backed progressive \u2013 Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum \u2013 won the Democratic primary with 34 percent of the vote . The contrast between a pro-Trump DeSantis and Gillum will probably keep Florida in Republican hands in November .\nFlorida gave President Trump and Republicans a second boost as GOP Gov . Rick Scott won an important primary victory for a U.S. Senate seat . Scott has proven in his two campaigns for governor that he is an aggressive , effective campaigner . It is very likely the blue wave in Florida will disappear with the DeSantis and Scott victories .\nIt is clear that the president \u2019 s judicial and economic victories build his prestige , and that prestige is giving him the muscle to reshape the Republican Party .\nIn Arizona , President Trump won another primary victory when Martha McSally , a congresswoman and Air Force veteran ( in fact , the first American woman to fly a fighter jet in combat ) won the Republican U.S. Senate nomination .\nPresident Trump praised McSally earlier this month at the signing ceremony for the National Defense Authorization Act . What looked at one time to be a close contest became a blowout , as McSally won 52 percent of the vote in a three-way race and was 24 points ahead of her closest competitor . Republican chances of keeping the Arizona seat are dramatically better with McSally as the nominee .\nBeyond the primaries , President Trump has been winning amazing victories in nominating \u2013 and with the leadership of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , getting the Senate to confirm \u2013 federal judges . Where Hillary Clinton would have nominated radical judges , President Trump has been consistently nominating constitutional conservatives to the courts . This will have a profound impact on America \u2019 s future .\nSo far , President Trump and McConnell have confirmed 60 federal judges \u2013 this includes Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch , 33 district court judges , and 26 court of appeals judges .\nAdditionally , President Trump has nominated more than 80 other judges across the federal system ( including Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh ) . McConnell has been doggedly working to get these nominees confirmed , and I suspect he will drive them through the Senate before the end of the year .\nSo on judges , President Trump is winning an amazing victory for conservatism . No wonder the left is in a frenzy .\nFinally , the breakthrough in trade negotiations with Mexico is , to use one of President Trump \u2019 s favorite words , huge .\nMost of the so-called experts had said the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) couldn \u2019 t be renegotiated . They insisted President Trump had offended Mexicans so much with his harsh language that the Mexican government wouldn \u2019 t come to the table . They asserted building the border wall would alienate the Mexican leaders . They were just plain wrong .\nMaking good on a big , disruptive pledge that set his 2016 campaign apart from every other candidate , the president kept his word and is forcing a difficult negotiation toward success .\nPresident Trump proved , once again , that tough language and tough negotiating can actually lead to breakthroughs .
