And new numbers out Monday show many are having a tougher time than you might think .\nOne in 10 working Americans between the ages of 35 and 44 are getting their wages garnished . That means their pay is being docked \u2014 often over an old credit card debt , medical bill or student loan .\nThat striking figure comes out of a collaboration between NPR and ProPublica . The reporting offers the first available national numbers on wage garnishment .\nBack in 2009 , Kevin Evans was one of millions of Americans blindsided by the recession . He had a 25-year career selling office furniture , but suddenly , companies stopped buying furniture . His income collapsed . He sold his three-bedroom home outside Kansas City that he could no longer afford .\nFor the next several years he worked a string of low-wage jobs : at a lumber yard , at a 24-hour fitness center . He rented a room from a friend . He never collected unemployment . But with a daughter in college and basic living expenses , he ended up with a $ 7,000 credit card debt that he says he could n't pay . Evans , 58 , had fallen from middle-class life into basic subsistence living .\nThen late last year , he found a better-paying , full-time customer service job in Springfield , Mo . Things were finally getting better , until early this year , when he opened his paycheck and found a quarter of it missing . His credit card lender , Capital One , had garnished his wages .\nTwice a month , whether he could afford it or not , 25 percent of his pay \u2014 the legal limit \u2014 would go to his debt , which had ballooned with interest and fees to more than $ 15,000 . `` It was a roundhouse from the right that just knocks you down and out , '' Evans says .\nThe recession and its aftermath have fueled an explosion of cases like Evans ' . Creditors and collectors have pursued struggling cardholders and other debtors in court , securing judgments that allow them to seize a chunk of even meager earnings . The financial blow can be devastating \u2014 more than half of U.S. states allow creditors to take a quarter of after-tax wages . But despite the rise in garnishments , the number of Americans affected has remained unknown .\nAt the request of ProPublica , ADP , the nation 's largest payroll services provider , undertook a study of payroll records for 13 million employees . ADP 's report , released Monday , shows that among employees in the prime working ages of 35 to 44 who had their wages garnished in 2013 , roughly half , unsurprisingly , owed child support . But a sizable number had their earnings docked for consumer debts , such as credit cards , medical bills and student loans .\nActually , for workers earning $ 25,000 to $ 40,000 a year , more people were garnished for consumer debt than for child support . This marks a dramatic change . In the past , the vast majority of wage garnishments went to secure child support payments or to collect on unpaid taxes . In recent years , though , debt collectors have been filing millions of lawsuits against people for just basic consumer debt : medical bills , student loans and credit card debt .\nExtended to the entire population of U.S. employees , ADP 's findings indicate that 4 million workers \u2014 about 3 percent of all employees \u2014 had wages taken for a consumer debt in 2013 . People in some geographic regions and income groups had twice that rate of garnishment .\nCarolyn Carter of the National Consumer Law Center says these findings are `` alarming . ''\n`` States and the federal government should look on reforming our wage garnishment laws with some urgency , '' she says .\nThe increase in consumer debt seizures is `` a big change , '' largely invisible to researchers because of the lack of data , says Michael Collins , faculty director of the Center for Financial Security at the University of Wisconsin , Madison . The potential financial hardship imposed by these seizures and their sheer number should grab the attention of policymakers , he says . `` It is something we should care about . ''\nADP 's study , the first large-scale look at how many employees are having their wages garnished and why , reveals what has been a hidden burden for working-class families . Wage seizures were most common among middle-aged , blue-collar workers and lower-income employees .\nNearly 5 percent of those earning between $ 25,000 and $ 40,000 per year had a portion of their wages diverted to pay down consumer debts alone in 2013 , ADP found . More people in that income group were garnished to pay off consumer debt than to pay child support .\nPerhaps due to the struggling economy in the region , the rate was highest in the Midwest . There , more than 6 percent of employees earning between $ 25,000 and $ 40,000 \u2014 1 in 16 \u2014 had wages seized over consumer debt . Employees in the Northeast had the lowest rate . The statistics were not broken down by race .\nCurrently , debtors ' fates depend significantly on where they happen to live . State laws vary widely . Four states \u2014 Texas , Pennsylvania , North Carolina and South Carolina \u2014 largely prohibit wage garnishment stemming from consumer debt .\nMost states , however , allow creditors to seize a quarter of a debtor 's wages \u2014 the highest rate permitted under federal law . Evans had the misfortune to live in Missouri , which not only allows creditors to seize 25 percent , but also allows them to continue to charge a high interest rate even after a judgment .\nA Note About Garnishment In Missouri Missouri provides a protection for a head of household with dependent children which caps the garnishment rate at 10 percent of a worker 's paycheck . But Kevin Evans did n't qualify for that \u2014 or even know about it . And the burden is on the debtor to know about such exemptions and ask for a lower garnishment rate . It is legal for debt collectors to seize 25 percent of people 's paychecks in Missouri even if they are head of household until the debtor objects and asks for the exemption .\nBy early 2010 , Evans had fallen so far behind that Capital One suspended his card . For months , he made monthly $ 200 payments toward his $ 7,000 debt , according to statements reviewed by NPR and ProPublica . But by this time , the payments barely kept pace with the interest piling on at 26 percent . In 2011 , when Evans could no longer keep up , Capital One filed suit . Court records show that Evans was served a summons , but he says he did n't understand that the stack of paperwork he received included a summons with a hearing date to appear in court .\nIf Evans had lived in neighboring Illinois , the interest rate on his debt would have dropped to below 10 percent after his creditor had won a judgment in court . But in Missouri , creditors can continue to add the contractual rate of interest for the life of the debt , so Evans ' bill kept mounting . Missouri law also allowed Capital One to tack on a $ 1,200 attorney fee . Some other states cap such fees to no more than a few hundred dollars .\nEvans has involuntarily paid over $ 6,000 this year on his old debt , an average of about $ 480 each paycheck , but he still owes more than $ 10,000 . `` It 's my debt . I want to pay it , '' Evans says . But `` I need to come up with large quantities of money so I do n't just keep getting pummeled . ''\nCapital One says in a statement that legal action is always a last resort . The company says it tried to work with Evans but that he was unable to keep up with the payments on a payment plan that he had agreed to .\nCompanies can also seize funds from a borrower 's bank account .
