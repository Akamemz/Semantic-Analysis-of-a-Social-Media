It \u2019 s a new kind of split between open societies and closed societies . \u201d\nSEBASTIEN BOZON/REUTERS Ms . Le Pen visits a chocolate-maker in Chalezeule in eastern France .\nThe region of undulating hills around Metz is sometimes called the \u201c Country of Three Borders \u201d because it is where France , Germany , and Luxembourg meet . If anyplace can call itself the heart of Europe , it is here . As FN supporters entered the arena for Le Pen \u2019 s rally on a rainy Saturday , the mayor of Metz , Dominique Gros , was hosting a mini ceremony just a few blocks away celebrating Franco-German friendship week .\nMr. Gros \u2019 s father fought in the French Resistance against the Germans . His grandfather died in the epic Battle of Verdun in World War I . His great-great-grandfather fought in the \u00adFranco-Prussian War . Gros himself was born in 1943 , in the middle of World War II . \u201c I learned when I was little that Germany was our enemy , \u201d he says . \u201c But we have succeeded in overcoming our ancestral hate ... and we must fight against this disastrous trend that risks pitting one against the other like in older times . \u201d\nGros is , in other words , a strong advocate of an integrated Europe .\nBut if this region is a story of overcoming animosity through shared interests , it \u2019 s also one of globalization and deindustrialization . It is the disappearance of jobs , and the loss of dignity as a result , that have turned many Metz voters toward Le Pen .\nAt the candidate \u2019 s rally , Camille Ajac says she supports a \u201c Europe of nations \u201d but not the EU , which she calls \u201c a Europe of interdependence. \u201d \u201c We absolutely want to get our sovereignty back , \u201d she says .\nJean Schweitzer , a baby boomer , says he simply wants to give a new party a chance \u201c since neither the right nor left has gotten us anywhere , and meanwhile France just gets worse. \u201d Antoine Dupont talks angrily about his grandmother \u2019 s financial woes . At age 82 , she \u2019 s been reduced to knitting stuffed animals to supplement her pension . He complains , too , that younger people are being forced to leave the country to find higher-paying jobs .\nThey all believe France \u2019 s future depends on the politician whom they describe as frank , simple , and honest \u2013 someone who could be a charismatic next-door neighbor .\nYVES HERMAN/REUTERS Members of the European Parliament in Brussels vote on whether to lift the EU parliamentary immunity of French far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen , a sharp critic of the European Union , after she came under investigation for tweeting pictures of Islamic State violence .\nLe Pen promises to hold a referendum on EU membership \u2013 what is called a \u201c Frexit \u201d vote \u2013 if she becomes president . At a rally in Lille , France , in March marking the 60th anniversary of the EU , she said flatly that \u201c the European Union will die , \u201d adding , \u201c the time has come to defeat globalists. \u201d She has called for the reintroduction of a new French currency , though she \u2019 s softened her tone in response to polls showing the vast majority of French want to keep the euro .\nAdvocates of European unity believe France \u2019 s departure from the EU would be catastrophic . \u201c The EU can survive without the [ United Kingdom ] . It wasn \u2019 t there in the first place . It \u2019 s always been sort of half in and half out , \u201d says Douglas Webber , professor of political science at INSEAD , a business school outside Paris . \u201c But if France is no longer there , then basically you are missing not just a foot , you are missing an arm , and a leg , and a good part of the torso . This would be a political ... revolution of the highest magnitude on the Richter scale . \u201d\nLe Pen \u2019 s stance on national identity \u2013 preventing more foreigners from coming in and diluting what it means to be French \u2013 resonates as much as any issue with her followers . It \u2019 s also what makes her sound the most like her father . She wants to reimpose immigration controls at the border . She promises to prevent companies from relocating abroad for cheaper labor .\nWhile detractors criticize her for stirring up hate , pointing often to a statement she made in 2010 comparing Muslims praying in the streets with the Nazi occupation of France , she has tapped into a deep anxiety about radical Islam in France . It has been fed by major terrorist attacks in Paris and Nice that together killed more than 230 people . At the same time , 1.3 million refugees and asylum-seekers , mostly Muslim , have entered Europe in the throes of upheaval in the Middle East , which the far-right easily conflates with terrorism .\n\u201c Let \u2019 s give France back to France , \u201d says Le Pen at the Metz rally .\nAs her followers chant \u201c On est chez nous , \u201d or \u201c We are in our house , \u201d she adds : \u201c What I want is not to close the borders . It is simply to have them \u2013 and control them . \u201d\nFor all her hard-line stances on immigration and the EU , it would be incorrect to classify Le Pen as simply far-right . She has , for instance , adopted a protectionist trade agenda that is increasingly attracting some former socialist and even communist voters .\nOn two other litmus-test issues , gay marriage and abortion , she has toned down her message or remained largely silent . The social conservative branch of the FN seems to be appeased by the voice of Le Pen \u2019 s niece , rising star Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen , who is a devout Roman Catholic and opposed to both . Yet the views of Le Pen herself , born in the pivotal year of 1968 amid student protests to what one family biographer calls a \u201c bourgeois bohemian \u201d mother , remain ambiguous . Her top adviser , Florian Philippot , is gay .\n\u201c Certainly in the \u2019 70s the FN was from the extreme right , but today all the parties that shake European political life , that are creating the surprises ... they are more complex than just a single party from the extreme right , \u201d says Mr. Perrineau .\nIn recent years , Le Pen has also tried to scrub the FN of its darker associations . She has kicked out members who publicly spew the kind of vitriol that was characteristic of her father and attempted to change the party \u2019 s image of being a party of racist old men .\nThe real inflection point came in 2015 . Her father repeated a comment that over the years has refused to fade from memory . Jean-Marie stood by his assertion , first made in 1987 , that the gas chambers of the Holocaust were a mere \u201c detail \u201d in history . Marine banished him from the party and publicly severed their relationship . Many observers have wondered whether the rupture was genuine , or just a brilliant moment of rebranding . Those close to her say it was painful and has been permanent and shows how politics always comes first with the Le Pens .\n\u201c You don \u2019 t break with your father in public on TV and have it not be difficult . It \u2019 s incomprehensible , \u201d says Bertrand Dutheil de la Roch\u00e8re , one of her advisers . \u201c But her father was impossible , just going from provocation to provocation . The FN and Marine don \u2019 t need provocation . \u201d\nHer campaign posters now bear just her first name , not her last , with the words : \u201c In the name of the people. \u201d The logo , now a blue rose , used to be a flame .\nJACQUES BRINON/AP \ufffcFrench far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen ( c. ) and his daughter Marine Le Pen arrive at a ceremony in Paris in 2010 . She broke off ties with her polemical father in 2015 .\nHow much the FN has revamped its image will be tested in the coming elections . Recent polls have Le Pen and 39-year-old centrist Emmanuel Macron , a former investment banker and minister in the ruling Socialist administration , as the front-runners in the first round of balloting on April 23 . Mr. Macron , who broke from the embattled Socialists last year , is running under his own party , En Marche ! , or On the Move .\nIt \u2019 s a wildly unpredictable race . Underdogs won the primaries of the two mainstream parties , the Republicans and the Socialists . Neither one is likely to make it past the first round of voting April 23 to the runoff on May 7 . That means it will come down to the pro-EU , pro-free trade Macron against the antiglobalization , anti-immigrant Le Pen .\nPolls for now give a significant edge to Macron in the second round , but in an era when Mr. Trump and \u201c Brexit \u201d triumphed , no one is predicting an unequivocal defeat for Le Pen .\n\u201c Macron speaks to the France that is doing well , \u201d says Perrineau . \u201c Marine Le Pen speaks to the France that is not doing well . \u201d\nThe steeliness that has helped Le Pen rise to the pinnacle of French politics may be rooted in that cold night in November 1976 when a 44-pound bomb went off in the family \u2019 s Paris apartment building . The explosion damaged 12 dwellings and sent a baby flying out a fifth-floor window . Amazingly , no one was hurt in the incident \u2013 including the child , who landed in a tree along with his mattress . To this day , no one knows who planted the bomb . But Le Pen , who was 8 at the time , has written that she emerged from the incident \u201c no longer a little girl like everyone else . \u201d\nThe youngest of three sisters , Le Pen and her family moved to the wealthy , western suburb of Saint-Cloud to a mansion called Montretout . Today it is tucked within a gated community and carries an air of serenity .\nBut Olivier Beaumont , a French journalist who wrote the book \u201c In the Hell of Montretout , \u201d compares it to the house in Alfred Hitchcock \u2019 s \u201c Psycho , \u201d a place that bore witness to unconventional tragedy , forming Le Pen \u2019 s tough character and ability to rise in politics as an unloved outsider . \u201c Her whole story is one of rupture , departures , doors slamming , \u201d he says .\nThe constant antipathy directed at her father hung over the family . Ultimately her mother , Pierrette , left \u2013 moving out one day when Le Pen was 16 . The distraught teen waited for her mother at the entrance of her high school every day for several weeks , certain she would come home . Instead her mother moved to the United States with a lover , leaking explosive commentary about her ex-husband . At one point , she posed for Playboy magazine . The humiliation was too much for young Marine : She didn \u2019 t talk to her mother again for 15 years .\nLe Pen \u2019 s entree into politics came at age 15 , when her father let her miss school for a week and join him on the campaign trail . Jean-Lin Lacapelle , one of her old friends and an FN official today , says no one at the time saw in her a French president . She didn \u2019 t want the life of a politician .\nInstead it was Marine \u2019 s older sister Marie-Caroline who was expected to take up that mantle , before she and her father had a falling-out and broke ties . Marine , in the meantime , became a lawyer and handled the party \u2019 s legal affairs .\nIn 2002 , Jean-Marie made it to the second round of the presidential elections to face Jacques Chirac , stunning the nation . Marine went on air to talk about it . She was in her early 30s , all smiles and optimism .\n\u201c The day after , at the headquarters of the Front National in Saint-Cloud , all of the press arrived asking , \u2018 Where is Marine Le Pen ? Where is Marine Le Pen ? \u2019 \u201d says Mr. Lacapelle . \u201c It was incredible . \u201d\nHe says that \u2019 s when he knew she would take the party to the top .\nThough older and more polished now , Le Pen still has a blunt , charismatic style that appeals to French youth . The FN is the most popular party in France among people ages 18 to 24 , drawing roughly a third of the social media-savvy demographic .\nPart of her allure is rooted in the plight of young people in the world \u2019 s sixth-largest economy , nearly a quarter of whom are unemployed . On the eve of Le Pen \u2019 s rally in Metz , 20-something supporters from across the country came together in the city \u2019 s party headquarters to discuss their plans for the following day . It had more the feel of an awkward school dance than a strategy session \u2013 they had put out bowls of potato chips and bottles of soda .\nEmilien No\u00e9 , a former Socialist who coordinates the youth movement in the region , says young people are drawn to the FN \u2019 s promise to restore French glory , something they \u2019 ve never known . \u201c A lot of young people are living abroad instead of in France , and this is sad for a country like ours , \u201d he says .\nWhile many Millennials are attracted to Le Pen because they see her as a rebel \u2013 one poster in the FN \u2019 s national headquarters trumpets \u201c The rebel wave \u201d \u2013 the candidate herself doesn \u2019 t act like the icon of a rebellion . In campaign imagery she is more likely to be photographed feeding cows and cuddling kittens .\nWhen she reveals pieces of her personal life , it \u2019 s often in the context of a mother of three children in their late teens . Friends say the twice-divorced politician is a workaholic . But when she does relax , one of her outlets is karaoke . Her choices reveal her era : With her raspy voice , she likes to belt out the songs of Dalida , the Egyptian-born Italian diva who was a global phenomenon from the 1960s into the \u2019 80s .\nLe Pen has made inroads with other voters , too , including women . She doesn \u2019 t carry the feminist mantle . That she would be the first female president of her country is hardly a factor the way it was with Hillary Clinton .\nBut she has positioned herself as a defender of women against the rise of Islamic fundamentalism . She wants the Islamic veil banned , as well as the burkini , saying neither belong in modern French society .\n\u201c We believe that a woman in a veil seems not to be free , \u201d says Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Lacoste Lareymondie , a regional counselor for the FN in the Grand Est .\nShe says women recognize themselves in Le Pen , a divorced single mother . \u201c She is a feminist , of course , \u201d says Ms. Lacoste Lareymondie . \u201c But she represents all kinds of women \u2013 mothers , lawyers , working women , political women . It \u2019 s complete . \u201d\nNot everyone buys it . Critics say her feminism is barely disguised discrimination against Muslims . At some public rallies , protesters denounce her as a \u201c fake feminist . \u201d\nLe Pen \u2019 s mother had two nicknames for Marine growing up : \u201c Miss bonne humeur , \u201d or \u201c Miss good mood , \u201d because of her resolutely joyful and optimistic nature , she writes in \u201c Against the Current. \u201d The other was \u201c Miss Trompe la morte , \u201d or \u201c Miss Daredevil , \u201d because of a fearlessness she showed as a child , whether on a bicycle or skis .\nIn the FN \u2019 s newest campaign video , Le Pen is facing the sea as an emotionally charged soundtrack pounds in the background . It feels like the trailer for a film . In a voice-over , she proclaims her love of France , the \u201c age-old nation that does not submit. \u201d She promises to stand up against the \u201c sufferings of \u201d and \u201c insults to \u201d the country . The video ends with her behind the wheel of a boat , a clear metaphor for one of her main campaign slogans , to steer the country toward what will \u201c put France in order . \u201d\nThe unsubtle subtext is that Paris needs the kind of strong leadership that has been missing under President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy before him . The French have always sought a \u201c strongman \u201d in their presidents , a monarchical instinct that turns them toward authority , especially in times of crisis .\n\u201c This is the country that produced Napoleon , the country that produced Charles de Gaulle , \u201d says Perrineau .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox . By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy\nBut he sees protest as the stronger current pushing Le Pen toward the doors of the \u00c9lys\u00e9e . He references French intellectual Pierre Rosanvallon , who said it \u2019 s no longer a time of elections in Western society . It is the time of \u201c dis-elections . \u201d\nIn the end , many French voters , says Perrineau , \u201c just want to vote in the bogeyman . \u201d",

Her top adviser, Florian Philippot, is gay.\n\n\u201cCertainly in the \u201970s the FN was from the extreme right, but today all the parties that shake European political life, that are creating the surprises ... they are more complex than just a single party from the extreme right,\u201d says Mr. Perrineau.\n\nIn recent years, Le Pen has also tried to scrub the FN of its darker associations. She has kicked out members who publicly spew the kind of vitriol that was characteristic of her father and attempted to change the party\u2019s image of being a party of racist old men.\n\nThe real inflection point came in 2015. Her father repeated a comment that over the years has refused to fade from memory. Jean-Marie stood by his assertion, first made in 1987, that the gas chambers of the Holocaust were a mere \u201cdetail\u201d in history. Marine banished him from the party and publicly severed their relationship. Many observers have wondered whether the rupture was genuine, or just a brilliant moment of rebranding. Those close to her say it was painful and has been permanent and shows how politics always comes first with the Le Pens.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t break with your father in public on TV and have it not be difficult. It\u2019s incomprehensible,\u201d says Bertrand Dutheil de la Roch\u00e8re, one of her advisers. \u201cBut her father was impossible, just going from provocation to provocation. The FN and Marine don\u2019t need provocation.\u201d\n\nHer campaign posters now bear just her first name, not her last, with the words: \u201cIn the name of the people.\u201d The logo, now a blue rose, used to be a flame.\n\nJACQUES BRINON/AP \ufffcFrench far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen (c.) and his daughter Marine Le Pen arrive at a ceremony in Paris in 2010. She broke off ties with her polemical father in 2015.\n\nHow much the FN has revamped its image will be tested in the coming elections. Recent polls have Le Pen and 39-year-old centrist Emmanuel Macron, a former investment banker and minister in the ruling Socialist administration, as the front-runners in the first round of balloting on April 23. Mr. Macron, who broke from the embattled Socialists last year, is running under his own party, En Marche!, or On the Move.\n\nIt\u2019s a wildly unpredictable race. Underdogs won the primaries of the two mainstream parties, the Republicans and the Socialists. Neither one is likely to make it past the first round of voting April 23 to the runoff on May 7. That means it will come down to the pro-EU, pro-free trade Macron against the antiglobalization, anti-immigrant Le Pen.\n\nPolls for now give a significant edge to Macron in the second round, but in an era when Mr. Trump and \u201cBrexit\u201d triumphed, no one is predicting an unequivocal defeat for Le Pen.\n\n\u201cMacron speaks to the France that is doing well,\u201d says Perrineau. \u201cMarine Le Pen speaks to the France that is not doing well.\u201d\n\nThe steeliness that has helped Le Pen rise to the pinnacle of French politics may be rooted in that cold night in November 1976 when a 44-pound bomb went off in the family\u2019s Paris apartment building. The explosion damaged 12 dwellings and sent a baby flying out a fifth-floor window. Amazingly, no one was hurt in the incident \u2013 including the child, who landed in a tree along with his mattress. To this day, no one knows who planted the bomb. But Le Pen, who was 8 at the time, has written that she emerged from the incident \u201cno longer a little girl like everyone else.\u201d\n\nThe youngest of three sisters, Le Pen and her family moved to the wealthy, western suburb of Saint-Cloud to a mansion called Montretout. Today it is tucked within a gated community and carries an air of serenity.\n\nBut Olivier Beaumont, a French journalist who wrote the book \u201cIn the Hell of Montretout,\u201d compares it to the house in Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cPsycho,\u201d a place that bore witness to unconventional tragedy, forming Le Pen\u2019s tough character and ability to rise in politics as an unloved outsider. \u201cHer whole story is one of rupture, departures, doors slamming,\u201d he says.\n\nThe constant antipathy directed at her father hung over the family. Ultimately her mother, Pierrette, left \u2013 moving out one day when Le Pen was 16. The distraught teen waited for her mother at the entrance of her high school every day for several weeks, certain she would come home. Instead her mother moved to the United States with a lover, leaking explosive commentary about her ex-husband. At one point, she posed for Playboy magazine. The humiliation was too much for young Marine: She didn\u2019t talk to her mother again for 15 years.\n\nLe Pen\u2019s entree into politics came at age 15, when her father let her miss school for a week and join him on the campaign trail. Jean-Lin Lacapelle, one of her old friends and an FN official today, says no one at the time saw in her a French president. She didn\u2019t want the life of a politician.\n\nInstead it was Marine\u2019s older sister Marie-Caroline who was expected to take up that mantle, before she and her father had a falling-out and broke ties. Marine, in the meantime, became a lawyer and handled the party\u2019s legal affairs.\n\nIn 2002, Jean-Marie made it to the second round of the presidential elections to face Jacques Chirac, stunning the nation. Marine went on air to talk about it. She was in her early 30s, all smiles and optimism.\n\n\u201cThe day after, at the headquarters of the Front National in Saint-Cloud, all of the press arrived asking, \u2018Where is Marine Le Pen? Where is Marine Le Pen?\u2019 \u201d says Mr. Lacapelle. \u201cIt was incredible.\u201d\n\nHe says that\u2019s when he knew she would take the party to the top.\n\nThough older and more polished now, Le Pen still has a blunt, charismatic style that appeals to French youth. The FN is the most popular party in France among people ages 18 to 24, drawing roughly a third of the social media-savvy demographic.\n\nPart of her allure is rooted in the plight of young people in the world\u2019s sixth-largest economy, nearly a quarter of whom are unemployed. On the eve of Le Pen\u2019s rally in Metz, 20-something supporters from across the country came together in the city\u2019s party headquarters to discuss their plans for the following day. It had more the feel of an awkward school dance than a strategy session \u2013 they had put out bowls of potato chips and bottles of soda.\n\nEmilien No\u00e9, a former Socialist who coordinates the youth movement in the region, says young people are drawn to the FN\u2019s promise to restore French glory, something they\u2019ve never known. \u201cA lot of young people are living abroad instead of in France, and this is sad for a country like ours,\u201d he says.\n\nWhile many Millennials are attracted to Le Pen because they see her as a rebel \u2013 one poster in the FN\u2019s national headquarters trumpets \u201cThe rebel wave\u201d \u2013 the candidate herself doesn\u2019t act like the icon of a rebellion. In campaign imagery she is more likely to be photographed feeding cows and cuddling kittens.\n\nWhen she reveals pieces of her personal life, it\u2019s often in the context of a mother of three children in their late teens. Friends say the twice-divorced politician is a workaholic. But when she does relax, one of her outlets is karaoke. Her choices reveal her era: With her raspy voice, she likes to belt out the songs of Dalida, the Egyptian-born Italian diva who was a global phenomenon from the 1960s into the \u201980s.\n\nLe Pen has made inroads with other voters, too, including women. She doesn\u2019t carry the feminist mantle. That she would be the first female president of her country is hardly a factor the way it was with Hillary Clinton.\n\nBut she has positioned herself as a defender of women against the rise of Islamic fundamentalism. She wants the Islamic veil banned, as well as the burkini, saying neither belong in modern French society.\n\n\u201cWe believe that a woman in a veil seems not to be free,\u201d says Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Lacoste Lareymondie, a regional counselor for the FN in the Grand Est.\n\nShe says women recognize themselves in Le Pen, a divorced single mother. \u201cShe is a feminist, of course,\u201d says Ms. Lacoste Lareymondie. \u201cBut she represents all kinds of women \u2013 mothers, lawyers, working women, political women. It\u2019s complete.\u201d\n\nNot everyone buys it. Critics say her feminism is barely disguised discrimination against Muslims. At some public rallies, protesters denounce her as a \u201cfake feminist.\u201d\n\nLe Pen\u2019s mother had two nicknames for Marine growing up: \u201cMiss bonne humeur,\u201d or \u201cMiss good mood,\u201d because of her resolutely joyful and optimistic nature, she writes in \u201cAgainst the Current.\u201d The other was \u201cMiss Trompe la morte,\u201d or \u201cMiss Daredevil,\u201d because of a fearlessness she showed as a child, whether on a bicycle or skis.\n\nIt\u2019s the intrepidness that seems to rally her base.\n\nIn the FN\u2019s newest campaign video, Le Pen is facing the sea as an emotionally charged soundtrack pounds in the background. It feels like the trailer for a film. In a voice-over, she proclaims her love of France, the \u201cage-old nation that does not submit.\u201d She promises to stand up against the \u201csufferings of\u201d and \u201cinsults to\u201d the country. The video ends with her behind the wheel of a boat, a clear metaphor for one of her main campaign slogans, to steer the country toward what will \u201cput France in order.\u201d\n\nThe unsubtle subtext is that Paris needs the kind of strong leadership that has been missing under President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy before him. The French have always sought a \u201cstrongman\u201d in their presidents, a monarchical instinct that turns them toward authority, especially in times of crisis.\n\n\u201cThis is the country that produced Napoleon, the country that produced Charles de Gaulle,\u201d says Perrineau.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

He references French intellectual Pierre Rosanvallon, who said it\u2019s no longer a time of elections in Western society. It is the time of \u201cdis-elections.\u201d\n\nIn the end, many French voters, says Perrineau, \u201cjust want to vote in the bogeyman.\u201d",
