    "content": "On Wednesday morning , Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey surprised many people by tweeting out an ambitious plan to hire an independent team , called `` Bluesky , '' to explore re-architecting Twitter as an open , standards-based `` protocol '' rather than its current state as a `` platform . '' As part of that tweetstorm , Dorsey cited a paper I wrote earlier this year , published by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University , entitled `` Protocols , Not Platforms : A Technological Approach to Free Speech . ''\nAssuming you do n't feel like reading that 7,000-word long academic piece on what this all could mean , I will make the simplified case here for why this could be a very big deal , while also noting that there 's an even greater probability that it will mean very little .\nLet 's start with a simple analogy . Compare email , an open standardized set of protocols including SMTP and IMAP , with Facebook Messenger , a proprietary , centralized messaging tool created , owned , and controlled entirely by a single company : Facebook .\nWith email , anyone could ( with a bit of technical knowhow ) set up their own email server . But since few people want to do that , there are plenty of places to get your own email address and client ( the interface through which you receive and send emails ) . Your internet provider often will give you an account , or you get a Gmail account from Google like basically everyone has . Here 's the interesting bit , though : even though Google has a huge market share of the email business with Gmail , the fact that it 's based on open email protocols means that you do n't have to rely on Google for anything . You can bring your own email address into Gmail if you want . Or you can use Gmail using a third party client , like Mozilla 's Thunderbird .\nAnd , perhaps even more important , it does n't matter which combination of these things you use because you can still communicate with anyone using any other email system . Do n't like what Google is doing with email or worried that the company might spy on you ? No problem , export your emails and contacts and go use something else . Nothing breaks . You do n't lose access to anyone else . Indeed , Google actually has tremendous market-based incentives to `` not be evil '' in this scenario , since it 's so easy for you to go elsewhere .\nCompare that to Facebook Messenger . If you want to communicate with someone on Facebook Messenger you need a Facebook account . And you need to use Facebook 's app . And you can only communicate with other people on Facebook using Facebook Messenger . If you do n't trust or like Facebook Messenger , you can certainly move to a different messaging app\u2014but you lose your history , you lose your contacts and you can only communicate with others who use your new choice of apps . And , worse , if Facebook decides it does n't want you on Facebook any more , you 're entirely out of luck . Facebook is , literally , the monopoly provider of Facebook Messenger .\nThe email/protocol example is the way much of the internet used to be in the early days . The Facebook Messenger example is what much of the internet became during the web 2.0 timeframe . Old-school open protocols were seen as less user-friendly , and less sustainable without a big company backing them .\nWhat Dorsey is proposing , however , is to take Twitter\u2014a proprietary , closed system\u2014and see if it 's possible to move it to the historical , more open protocols of the early internet . This would mean giving up centralized control , pushing more power and control out to the end users , and creating a more competitive market for a better version of Twitter .\nWhile it has resulted in plenty of eye-rolling , Dorsey 's nod to the possibility of cryptocurrency/blockchains is quite interesting here as well : `` Blockchain points to a series of decentralized solutions for open and durable hosting , governance , and even monetization . '' As he notes at the end , this offers up a potential business model that could keep a protocol sustainable ( unlike in the past ) without the need to resort to sucking up all your data and targeting ads .\nIt has the potential to , at the very least , shift the discussion on three of the biggest complaints concerning the big internet companies today : competition , privacy , and content moderation . By default , it enables more competition . Depending on how it 's structured , you can reduce the privacy questions by ( 1 ) reducing the need for data since you might not need targeted ads to support it ; ( 2 ) handing the data control back to the ends or to more trusted third party data stores ; and ( 3 ) incentivizing better behavior because of the ease of switching . And , it allows for better content moderation options by allowing there to be both competition at the moderation/filter level , but also in allowing end users to opt into their own level of moderation comfort , rather than leaving it all up to a single monolithic entity .\nIf this works , it would completely upend much of how the internet is looked at today , potentially limiting the internet 's biggest annoyances , while retaining its best features : the ability to freely connect and communicate with people around the globe . But that 's a very big `` if '' at the beginning of this paragraph . There is no history of taking a proprietary , closed platform and turning it into a broad , open protocol . However , Twitter is well-positioned to make it happen\u2014perhaps better than almost anyone else . Other efforts to build a new social media protocol from scratch ( and there are many ) suffer from a failure to attract a large enough audience . Twitter brings scale .\nThere are many reasons why this could fail .
