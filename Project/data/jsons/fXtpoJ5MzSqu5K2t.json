The theme park is still pending government approval to reopen.\n\n\u201cWe recognize that the COVID-19 situation is constantly evolving, which is why our reopening approach is deliberately fluid and phased, and there are many factors that are helping us determine the timing of when various aspects of our business will reopen in a responsible way,\u201d Disneyland said in a statement.\n\nDisneyland planned to reopen on July 17, but California has begun to reverse the reopening process in the state due to increasing cases of the virus.\n\nIn July, California rolled back reopenings of restaurants, wineries, movie theaters, museums, card rooms, and bars.\n\nPlans to reopen the theme park raised concerns among some groups about the health and safety of everyone entering Disneyland.\n\n\u201cTheme parks are ranked one of the most dangerous places on every public health authorities ranking,\u201d organizing director for labor union Unite Here Local 11 representing Disneyland employees, Austin Lynch, told Scriberr News.\n\nEmployees want to return to work, but it needs to be safe, Lynch said.\n\n\u201cOtherwise, from what we\u2019ve seen, all it means is that they open, lose the public\u2019s trust and close back down again, and that doesn\u2019t work with us,\u201d Lynch said.\n\nThere have been productive discussions between the union and Disney to accommodate similar concerns between one another.\n\n\u201cIn order to reopen our theme parks, we need to negotiate agreements with our unions to return employees to work,\u201d Disneyland stated on June 24.\n\nHowever, Lynch emphasized that Disneyland is missing a crucial piece which is to provide testing to ensure the health of the employees.\n\n\u201cWhat they are going to need is to offer to test because we work with people from all over the world,\u201d housekeeper at the Disneyland Hotel, Ines Guzman told Scriberr News.\n\nDisneyland has accommodated many of the union\u2019s concerns, but testing has not been one of them.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re (Disney) claiming that health authorities say that the testing will not be an effective screening method that the better thing is just to focus on prevention and prevention measures, but we want both,\u201d Lynch said.\n\nDisneyland has issued several health and safety measures that will be enforced once the park decides to reopen.\n\nGuidelines include mandatory face covering for cast members and guests, reduction in theme park capacity, temperature check before entering Downtown Disney, cashless transactions, reduced cast member interactions, and enhanced cleaning within the park.\n\nThe Downtown Disney District reopened on July 9, with health and safety protocols similar to the Disneyland health guidelines.\n\nDowntown Disney opened dining restaurants and merchandise stores with some using a mobile waitlist to manage the number of guests entering the store.\n\nThe hotels in downtown have not been approved to reopen, but Guzman raises concerns about her health once it does open.\n\nGuzman explains as a housekeeper; she is required to clean many rooms and wants Disney to provide extra help with disinfecting the rooms.\n\n\u201cBeing in the housekeeping department, I feel like they should have more workers to help us with all the disinfecting,\u201d Guzman said.\n\nGuzman wishes to return to work soon, but as long as Disney stays accountable and takes precautionary measures.\n\nLynch explained another upcoming issue the union has been discussing, which are the subcontractors with Disney not openly committing to safety measures.\n\n\u201cDisney has subcontractors, Sodexo, that serves food in the employee cafeterias throughout the whole resort, and they have not committed even to the measures that Disney has,\u201d Lynch said.\n\nSodexoMAGIC is a joint company with Sodexo Corporation and Magic Johnson.\n\n\u201cSo again, goes back to that problem that a net without a hole is no net at all,\u201d Lynch said.\n\nThe union continues to push Disney to commit in writing to all of the safety and health measures.\n\n\u201cWe want the company to commit in writing to all the safety measures that are necessary for reopening, testing is one,\u201d Lynch said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also other important ones like safe workload so that the commitment to clean, sanitize, and disinfect more often is real.\u201d\n\nDisney World in Orlando, Florida, has recently reopened on July 11, even with the state\u2019s increasing number of coronavirus cases surpassing 350,000.\n\nThere has been no confirmed date for Disneyland Anaheim or Disney Hotels to reopen.\n\n",
