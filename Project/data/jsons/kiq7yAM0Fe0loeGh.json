    "content": "Things are moving fast in American politics , but see if you can remember back five months to last fall . At the time , Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was the most likely Democratic nominee .\nShe had big leads in both Iowa and New Hampshire . She had overtaken establishment designated front-runner , Joe Biden , in the national polling .\nDEMOCRACY 2020 DIGEST : WARREN IN NO RUSH TO BACK BIDEN OR SANDERS\nThe race last fall was Warren 's to lose -- and lose it she did , spectacularly .\nWarren did n't win a single state . In fact , she never took second place . She got creamed in Massachusetts where she lives .\nOn Thursday , finally , Warren dropped out , having succeeded only in humiliating herself . As the Babylon Bee put it , `` Warren returns to tribe in shame after failing to take land back from the pale faces . '' You can imagine how disappointed the Cherokees were .\nSo what happened to Elizabeth Warren ? Well , it 's an interesting story , actually , filled with valuable lessons for political candidates as well as for the rest of us .\nBut Warren was in no mood for learning . She already knew the answer , as she so often does . And it turned out to be the very same answer she has offered in response to virtually every question she 's been asked over the last six months : It was sexism . That 's why she lost .\nDemocratic voters , the majority of whom are female , hate women , Warren explained . They may have nominated a woman in the last presidential race , but that was probably an act of sexism , too . That 's how sexist they are . Super-duper sexist .\nSen. Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass. , former presidential candidate : If you say , yes , there was sexism in this race , everyone says , `` Whiner ! '' And if you say no , there was no sexism , about a bazillion women think , `` What planet do you live on ? '' I promise you this : I will have a lot more to say on that subject later on .\nThat 's a promise , she said . In other words , there will be many more lectures on sexism to come from Professor Warren . Buy your tickets now , the hall is certain to be packed .\nOne day Warren was talking about raising wages and protecting American workers . The next , she was ranting about strange forms of racism nobody had ever heard of , and then attacking the country she has once sought to improve .\nIn the front row , you 'll see your favorite cable news commentators , who are themselves lifelong warriors against sexism . Yes , it is true that these are the very same people who have spent months now acting as publicists for Michael Bloomberg , and now Joe Biden , both of whom are demonstrably male . But in their hearts , our friends on TV were always rooting for the woman . That 's the kind of people they are -- highly unsexist people .\nKaren Finney , former senior adviser to the Hillary Clinton campaign : Our country is still very uncomfortable with women in power . Men come into a race with the expectation that they 're qualified , women have to prove themselves . When a woman takes a hit at particularly a male candidate , she takes a hit in her likability .\nDavid Swerdlick , CNN political commentator : Senator Warren was hammered on her Medicare-for-all plan and her tax plans in a way that none of the men were the entire last year . To me , that was a sexist double standard .\nZerlina Maxwell , former Clinton campaign media director : She would have done much better if she were a man , and I would like more men to be vocal about the fact that they want to see women in positions of leadership .\nYeah , sexism . She can see why Elizabeth Warren is so upset .\nTo be fair , Bernie Sanders did warn her more than a year ago that a woman could n't win . He did n't want her to get hurt , but she just would n't listen .\nJust kidding . That never happened . Warren made it up , or maybe she believed it happened , which is worse . Warren has convinced herself of a lot of strange things recently . It 's been poignant to watch it happen .\nWarren is no Beto O'Rourke ; she is n't doing bong hits on her skateboard after lunch . She 's a legitimately smart person -- without question , the smartest candidate in the Democratic field . She 's also tough as hell , and fake Indian affirmative action ploy aside , she 's fairly accomplished , especially by the low standards of political life .\nNearly 20 years ago , Warren wrote a book called `` The Two-Income Trap '' about how the mass entry of mothers into the workforce left families poorer . It was not a predictable academic diatribe that ends with a call for socialism . In fact , it was interesting and well-researched . And above all , it was serious .\nWarren wrote about a real problem , one that affects most Americans , and then thought deeply about how to solve it . The book was impressive . It could have been the basis of a populist presidential campaign that would have forced much needed national conversations about these issues , and in the end , might have won .\nBut none of that ever happened . Warren got derailed . More precisely , she became infected with a virulent strain of identity politics .
