Ted Cruz , R-Texas , emerging as the party \u2019 s standard-bearer in the presidential sweepstakes .\nThe theory is that both candidates are so polarizing that their electoral prospects will impale Republican candidates down the ballot .\nLet \u2019 s start with the House . The GOP currently holds a 246-188 edge over Democrats . The current vacant seat belonged to former House Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio , and is expected to stay in Republican hands . So for the sake of argument , let \u2019 s say it \u2019 s 247-188 in favor of the GOP . Democrats would have to flip a staggering net of 30 seats to reclaim control of the House .\nDemocrats would be rapturous at the prospects of rank-and-file Republicans having to defund Trump or Cruz -- or run away from them .\nDemocrats could probably put a substantial dent in that 30-seat Republican margin . But that \u2019 s expected in a presidential election year . It \u2019 s just a question of how many more seats a Trump or Cruz candidacy could turn to Democratic control .\nBut make no mistake : Knowledgeable sources on both sides of the aisle are clear that it would be almost impossible for Democrats to win back the House this cycle . That net gain of 30 seats is just too high a bar . The map favors Republicans .\nThere aren \u2019 t a lot of \u201c swing \u201d districts in which Democrats could steal a seat or two . Nothing is ever out of the question . But the likelihood of Democrats nabbing the House majority is low at this writing .\nThe Senate , however , is another story . Republicans already faced an uphill climb to retain their majority this fall . The GOP must defend 24 seats . Only 10 Democratic seats are up this cycle . Plus , it \u2019 s a presidential year . And , many of the Republican seats on the ballot are in \u201c purple \u201d states or states that President Obama won in 2008 and 2012 .\nFor the GOP , Sens . Ron Johnson , Wis. , Mark Kirk , Ill. , Rob Portman , Ohio , Kelly Ayotte , N.H. , Pat Toomey , Pa. , and Richard Burr , N.C. , are running in competitive states . Democrats would also like to win the seat now held by GOP Florida Sen. Marco Rubio , who is running for president and not seeking re-election to the Senate .\nDemocrats must also defend the seat of Sen. Michael Bennet , Colo. , and the seat of retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid , Nevada .\nColorado and Nevada are potential GOP pickups . Republicans currently hold a 54-46 advantage over the Democrats in the Senate ( two independent senators caucus with the Democrats ) .\nSo a net gain of five seats isn \u2019 t out of the realm for Democrats . Many political theorists think those seats in swing states could all tilt to the Democratic side if Trump or Cruz is the nominee .\nThis pariah status for Trump and Cruz is rare . On Thursday , a reporter asked Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , whether he preferred Cruz over Trump .\n\u201c It \u2019 s like being shot or poisoned . It doesn \u2019 t really matter , \u201d replied Graham . \u201c Donald Trump is the most-unprepared person I \u2019 ve ever met to be commander-in-chief . \u201d\nLast week , House and Senate Republicans huddled jointly in Baltimore for their annual issues retreat . Much of the conversation focused on an approach to fighting ISIS , terrorism and polling . Trump and Cruz weren \u2019 t there .\nBut their specter haunted the entire confab . As a result , Republican leaders tried to present a positive image and sidestep internecine battles that loom inside the party .\n\u201c What happens above us on the presidential campaign is out of our control . So you try to control what you can control , \u201d said Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Thune , S.D .\nWhen asked about the eventual nominee , Thune left scribes with a less-than-confident answer that spoke deeply to Republican divisions .\n\u201c Hopefully we \u2019 ll be able to sync up with their agenda , \u201d he said about the nominee .\nHouse Majority Whip Steve Scalise , R-La. , sought to deflect inquiries about the GOP chasms and pivoted to fissures among Democrats .\n\u201c I think if you look at the fractures , there are more on the Democratic side , \u201d proffered Scalise . \u201c Hillary Clinton hasn \u2019 t been able to close the deal yet .
