In between those two extremes, the spending is quite literally all over the map. And the amount of spending doesn't necessarily translate into better health care.

Overall, where does the money come from?\n\nThere are three different stages as countries develop. Low-income countries spend the least on health, and the sources of that little bit of funding are international donors and people paying out of pocket. In middle-income countries, people still pay out of pocket, but the government has more capacity and is paying for some health care. And in high-income countries, the money comes mostly from government and private insurance.\n\nWhat's the impact on health care when people pay out of pocket?\n\nWhen people are paying out of pocket, the poorest people will forgo treatment \u2014 or they'll have treatment and be thrown into poverty because of medical costs. That's mostly a problem for poor countries, though the U.S. stands out among high-income countries as having catastrophic medical expenditures that put people into poverty.\n\nDo measures of health, like high life expectancy, improve as medical spending goes up?\n\nWell, yes, but it's a little hard to prove that higher spending causes better health outcomes.

Generally, as health spending goes up, so do health outcomes. But there are so many outliers.\n\nWhat outliers?\n\nWith development, health outcomes generally improve, but the U.S. is an anomaly. The U.S. and the U.K. are both high-income, highly developed countries. The U.K. spends less per person ($3,749) on health care than the U.S. ($9,237).
