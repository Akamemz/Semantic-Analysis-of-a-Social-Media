    "content": "Having hit the Senate GOP 's healthcare bill pretty hard last evening , I feel obliged to present a much sunnier assessment for your edification and consideration . Avik Roy , a conservative healthcare policy expert whose work we have cited on many occasions is a big fan of the new proposal , taking to Twitter to declare it a legislative triumph . Agree or disagree -- and I 'll do a bit of both below -- the profane , unhinged , substanceless replies from leftists accusing Roy of supporting murder , with more than a dash or two of overt racism , are appalling . Many liberals appear incapable of good-faith debate over good-faith policy differences . More on that in a moment , too . But first , Roy 's take :\nFinished reading the Senate HC bill . Put simply : If it passes , it \u2019 ll be the greatest policy achievement by a GOP Congress in my lifetime . \u2014 Avik Roy ( @ Avik ) June 22 , 2017\nA few highlights from his Forbes analysis , published this morning :\nIn March , when House Republicans published their bill to replace Obamacare\u2014the American Health Care Act\u2014I described it in Forbes this way : \u201c GOP \u2019 s Obamacare Replacement Will Make Coverage Unaffordable For Millions\u2014Otherwise , It \u2019 s Great. \u201d I meant it . There were great things about the House bill , in particular its far-reaching reforms of the Medicaid program . But Paul Ryan \u2019 s bill contained a fatal flaw . Its flat tax credits , which provided identical assistance to the poor and the wealthy , would price millions of near-elderly low-income workers out of the insurance market and trap millions more in poverty . Fortunately , buried in the House bill was a way out of the morass . Section 202 of the bill contains a transitional schedule of tax credits that was meant to serve as a bridge between the old Obamacare system , ending in 2017 , and the new Paul Ryan system , beginning in 2020 .\nIt turns out that if you simply kept that bridge in force , and tossed overboard the Paul Ryan flat tax credit , you \u2019 d solve all of these problems with the House bill . By making that change , the near-elderly working poor would be able to afford coverage , and the poverty trap would be eliminated . And that \u2019 s precisely what the Senate bill did ! Section 102 of the Senate bill\u2014the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017\u2014closely mirrors Section 202 of the House bill , with age- and means-tested tax credits up to 350 percent of the Federal Poverty Level . Making this change not only solves the problems I described above . It also makes it easier to reform the Medicaid program .\nI should note at this point that one of my policy concerns about the House-passed bill is that it would hang lower-income near-seniors out to dry with skimpy tax credits , pricing many of them out of affordable coverage . This change , and it 's a significant one , addresses that problem . There 's an argument to be made that the Senate bill overcompensates , applying a tax credit framework that closely resembles Obamacare to the entire replacement law , rather than more narrowly targeting assistance to populations who would be disproportionately impacted under the House 's age-based system . There are good reasons why many conservatives are objecting that `` repeal '' utilizes a whole lot of Obamacare 's plumbing . Roy goes to cheer the proposal 's Medicaid reforms , talking up vastly increased flexibility for states , and explaining why the system is failing so many people as it 's currently constituted . He also briefly touches on my number one problem with the Senate bill :\nThere \u2019 s one key flaw in the Senate bill . It had been originally reported that the bill would contain a six-month waiting period for those who did not sign up during open enrollment each winter . Such a waiting period is important to ensure that people don \u2019 t jump in and out of the insurance pool when their sick or healthy , respectively . But no such waiting period was included in the bill , reportedly because the Senate is still trying to work out how such a waiting period would work within Senate parliamentary rules .\nThis version of the Senate plan has no meaningful and lasting mechanism ( front-end `` stabilization '' via bailout-style payments to insurers do n't count ) to prevent an individual market death spiral . You ca n't keep Obamacare 's dual mandates requiring all insurers to sell plans to people with pre-existing conditions at approximately the same price points as healthy consumers without some form of strong incentive to bring healthy people into the market before getting sick or hurt . Otherwise , people make the eminently rational ( and market-destroying ) choice to free load , saving hundreds on monthly premiums , secure in the knowledge that if they should need care , they can sign up for price-controlled `` insurance '' as needed . The House bill had a `` continuous coverage '' requirement on this front , as well as allowing carriers to apply a 30 percent surcharge to a non-continuously-insured consumer who suddenly shows up to buy a plan with a pre-existing condition ( the House bill also established several layers of protections for people with such conditions ) . I was never confident that even these elements were adequate to address the challenge . Yet the Senate 's version excludes both provisions , even passing over the ( arguably less robust ) incentive-imposing idea of a half-year waiting period for new customers who failed to sign up during annual open enrollment .\nThe individual mandate imposed an unconstitutional requirement that every citizen purchase a product ; it was only salvaged by a last-minute feat of intellectual gymnastics by Chief Justice Roberts , reimagining it as a tax . Its success in coercing people to enter Obamacare 's marketplaces has been wildly exaggerated by the Congressional Budget Office , which continues to ignore actual data while imputing mystical powers to the mandate 's effectiveness . Still , it clearly has had some significant impact , but not enough of one to stave off a deteriorating Obamacare spiral . Unless a replacement bill both ( a ) brings down costs significantly for many Americans in the individual market -- especially younger and healthier ones -- and ( b ) strongly disincentives free loading as a viable choice , it will fail . In fact , it would likely magnify Obamacare 's deepening failures . Perhaps the Senate intends to insert these ideas during the amendment process . Perhaps they 've left them out due to concerns over 'Byrd Rule ' compliance under reconciliation . Regardless , enacting a law that lacks essential death-spiral-prevention measures would be extremely reckless . It 's worse than doing nothing -- which is saying a lot .\nWhile I agree with Roy 's support for needed Medicaid reforms , I 'm not convinced the Senate 's offering is necessarily superior to the House 's . The upper chamber punts many of the biggest Medicaid changes to beyond the 2020 and 2024 elections , raising my cynicism about whether those out-year , politically-difficult changes will ever actually occur . And because the Senate bill 'makes up for ' this more gradual glide path by instituting a more stringent growth rate for Medicaid 's capped spending increases , I worry that political pressures to alter or abandon those changes would become more potent because the `` cliff '' would look steeper as it approaches . I also agree with Philip Klein that one of Roy 's comparisons employed to dismiss conservative critics ' complaints is unfair -- even as someone who would be willing to support a bill that at least makes relatively modest improvements over the status quo ( I 'm not sure the Senate proposal does that , yet ) . All that said , the Left 's stupid , self-righteous , nasty demagoguery against this bill is insulting and irresponsible . For a bunch of people who like to claime that the 2011 shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was caused by heated right-wing rhetoric ( this was an entirely scurrilous and baseless charge ) , they seem awfully eager to smear Republicans as a bunch of greedy , blood-thirsty killers . Disgusting :\nI \u2019 ve read the Republican \u201c health care \u201d bill . This is blood money . They \u2019 re paying for tax cuts with American lives . pic.twitter.com/298DLguNiM \u2014 Elizabeth Warren ( @ SenWarren ) June 22 , 2017\nIn this debate , Warren is playing the role of Sarah `` Death Panels '' Palin ( though Palin never perpetrated a racial hoax to benefit her career ) , against whom every fact-checker under the sun sprung into action . Most Democrats have refrained from this degree of wild-eyed , hysterical venom , instead coalescing around the talking point that the Senate bill is `` mean '' -- even more so than the House bill . This is an object lesson in bad-faith argument . The House legislation was excoriated by liberals for failing to guarantee `` community rating '' cost control regulations for people with pre-existing conditions , and for offering insufficiently generous tax credits to older , low income Americans . The Senate iteration substantively addresses both complaints , yet was promptly declared even worse than the House-passed legislation , and not for the substantive reasons I 've laid out above . They were always going to dial up the freakout to eleven , regardless of what was in the legislative language . Many on the Left have shifted away from the previous complaints to Medicaid , shouting about how the GOP would ' virtually zero out ' the program , which is flatly untrue . Reversing an unsustainable expansion is wise policy . And decreasing the rate of growth is not a `` deep cut , '' let alone an elimination of the program .\nBut if Democrats want to talk about what 's `` mean , '' Republicans can easily engage them on those terms . It 's mean to prop up an objectively failing law that 's growing more dysfunctional and harming more people -- and for what ? To protect Obama 's legacy , dressed up as 'helping people ' ? It 's mean to take a government program that was already badly betraying America 's most indigent and vulnerable citizens and expand it to millions of new people , compounding budget and access strains . And it 's mean to accuse your opponents of 'killing ' people over public policy disagreements , especially when your own policy has not saved American lives , in the aggregate . In fact , as death rates have risen under Obamacare , the stats are worse in Medicaid expansion states than non-expansion states . That 's data . Since Democrats seem content to casually throw around slanderous , motive-impugning , sloppy causation arguments , do Medicaid expanders have `` blood on their hands , '' under Sen. Warren 's disgraceful standard ? I 'll leave you with a Politico story about the wiliness of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell . I 've expressed my deep skepticism about a successful vote occurring next week , but if anyone is capable of delivering a surprise , it 's him :",
