If you believe innocent owners of some tool should be subject to control , harassment , and arrest or death if they resist , as long as some owners of that tool , even a vanishingly small number of them , harm other people , none of this will make much sense .\nThe above are questions of sensibility , and certainly arguable . Empirical understanding is in play as well .\nTo resist an instant call to more or tougher gun laws or enforcement in the wake of terrors like Vegas , you need to understand it is not only that existing laws and regulations will not reliably prevent such crimes as long as guns exist . All the new or expanded national gun control laws advocated as sensible and necessary would have had no effect on horrible crimes such as occurred in Las Vegas last night , even if perfectly enforced , as Jacob Sullum explained at Reason earlier today .

Hard as it is to admit , some tragedies are not meaningfully preventable . )\nWith that understood , the only relevant legal response to nightmares like Las Vegas is a total ban and confiscation of at least types of weapons , as The New York Times argued in a rare front page editorial against what they consider `` assault rifles '' in December 2015 after the Orlando nightclub massacre .\nAnother idea on the minds of those who obdurately refuse to seize on a new legal solution when nightmares such as Las Vegas occurs is that public policy should rely on measured , proportionate reactions that consider and balance the demonstrated prevalence of any given public threat or crisis .\nDespite Nevada 's much-discussed `` loose '' or `` lax '' gun laws , over the course of the three years prior to 2017 , rifles were used in murders four known times in the state , according to the FBI 's Uniform Crime report .\nNevada 's figures , though , show an unusually large number of gun murders where the type of gun used is unknown . But if you presume the ratio of handgun to rifle murders is similar for known and unknown gun type , you should add 20 more rifle murders , for a total of 24 in the three-year period . That larger number represents 4 percent of total murders in Nevada over that three-year period . For some context , killers used hands or fists to murder 25 times during that same period .\nWith its `` lax '' gun laws , Nevada saw 67 percent of its murders committed with a gun last year .
