Tuesday, those two sweeping goals collided as a GOP-controlled House committee voted to advance hundreds of billions in tax cuts at the cost of adding those billions to the deficit.\n\nThe House Ways and Means Committee voted almost entirely along party lines to make six tax breaks permanent at a cost of $310 billion over the next 10 years.\n\nFollow @politicaltickerFollow @LisaDCNN\n\nThe top Democrat on the committee pounced.\n\n\u201cTo say that Republican action today is hypocritical is a serious understatement,\u201d Rep. Sandy Levin of Michigan said. \u201cThis approach today of Republicans flies smack in the face of fiscal responsibility.\u201d\n\nBut the committee\u2019s Republican chairman, Dave Camp, also of Michigan, did not blink. He responded that the tax breaks have been passed year after year without any offsets.\n\n\u201cThis bill has been extended, unpaid for, probably 30 times,\u201d Camp said of a research tax credit. \u201cI think it\u2019s important we extend this \u2026 supporting permanency, not a temporary extension.\u201d\n\nTeam Camp also points to another argument: They believe the jobs that come from tax breaks are worth adding some red ink to the deficit.\n\n\u201cThese are things that people feel are extremely worth adding to the economy,\u201d said Camp spokeswoman Sarah Swinehart.\n\nWhat\u2019s $310 billion get you?\n\nThese six so-called \u201ctax extenders\u201d that the Ways and Means Committee approved Tuesday were plucked from a larger group of 55 tax breaks that expired at the end of 2013 and have been waiting for congressional renewal.\n\nAmong those passed Tuesday were three biggies: the research and experimentation deduction, the credit that helps small businesses with major equipment costs, and the break for businesses earning rent and interest overseas.\n\nCamp was correct. In recent years, Congress has extended the breaks year after year without offsetting their costs. But in the 90s, most of them were offset.\n\nWhy the flashpoint now?\n\nDemocrats are particularly pressing the issue now because they see a conflict between the Republican demands that spending, especially on Democratic priorities like unemployment benefits, be offset while the GOP allows their own priority \u2013 tax cuts \u2013 to add to the deficit.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a clear double standard, particularly when you hold up unemployment,\u201d said Chuck Marr, director of tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nBut Democrats also have exceptions to pay-for pushes, notably, many Democrats believe that unemployment benefits are emergency spending and do not need to be offset.\n\nWhen asked if that is a double standard from the left, Marr said no.\n\n\u201cUnemployment insurance is a temporary, countercyclical move,\u201d he replied. \u201cWhat Republicans are doing here is pushing for something permanent and unpaid for.\u201d\n\nGOP chooses tax cuts at expense of deficit\n\nRepublicans insist their decision to choose tax cuts over trimming the deficit is nothing new.\n\n\u201c(Chairman Camp) has the position that extensions of current policy and tax cuts don\u2019t have to be paid for,\u201d said Swinehart. \u201cPay-fors are for spending. New spending. That\u2019s his position.\u201d\n\nYet, in Camp\u2019s recent sweeping tax reform proposal, he did pay for all the tax cuts he extended. He did that largely by repealing other tax cuts. But that proposal is not going anywhere.\n\nCamp insists that\u2019s not a contradiction. His office argues that paying for tax breaks is only possible in a comprehensive revision of the tax system, not when tax breaks are taken one by one as the House is preparing to do now.\n\nThe result: On Tuesday, Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee choose their anti-tax crusade over their image as deficit hawks.\n\nNext, all Republicans in the House will face a similar choice.\n\nMultiple GOP sources tell CNN they expect all six tax credit bills to get votes on the House floor and that leadership is still working out the exact timing.",
