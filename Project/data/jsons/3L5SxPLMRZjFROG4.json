    "content": "Inside the Fox News lie machine : I fact-checked Sean Hannity on Obamacare UPDATE I re-reported a Fox News segment on Obamacare -- it was appallingly easy to see how it misleads the audience\nI happened to turn on the Hannity show on Fox News last Friday evening . \u201c Average Americans are feeling the pain of Obamacare and the healthcare overhaul train wreck , \u201d Hannity announced , \u201c and six of them are here tonight to tell us their stories. \u201d Three married couples were neatly arranged in his studio , the wives seated and the men standing behind them , like game show contestants .\nAs Hannity called on each of them , the guests recounted their \u201c Obamacare \u201d horror stories : canceled policies , premium hikes , restrictions on the freedom to see a doctor of their choice , financial burdens upon their small businesses and so on .\n\u201c These are the stories that the media refuses to cover , \u201d Hannity interjected .\nBut none of it smelled right to me . Nothing these folks were saying jibed with the basic facts of the Affordable Care Act as I understand them . I understand them fairly well ; I have worked as a senior adviser to a governor and helped him deal with the new federal rules .\nI decided to hit the pavement . I tracked down Hannity \u2019 s guests , one by one , and did my own telephone interviews with them .\nFirst I spoke with Paul Cox of Leicester , N.C . He and his wife Michelle had lamented to Hannity that because of Obamacare , they can \u2019 t grow their construction business and they have kept their employees below a certain number of hours , so that they are part-timers .\nObamacare has no effect on businesses with 49 employees or less . But in our brief conversation on the phone , Paul revealed that he has only four employees . Why the cutback on his workforce ? \u201c Well , \u201d he said , \u201c I haven \u2019 t been forced to do so , it \u2019 s just that I \u2019 ve chosen to do so . I have to deal with increased costs. \u201d What costs ? And how , I asked him , is any of it due to Obamacare ? There was a long pause , after which he said he \u2019 d call me back . He never did .\nThere is only one Obamacare requirement that applies to a company of this size : workers must be notified of the existence of the \u201c healthcare.gov \u201d website , the insurance exchange . That \u2019 s all .\nNext I called Allison Denijs . She \u2019 d told Hannity that she pays over $ 13,000 a year in premiums . Like the other guests , she said she had recently gotten a letter from Blue Cross saying that her policy was being terminated and a new , ACA-compliant policy would take its place . She says this shows that Obama lied when he promised Americans that we could keep our existing policies .\nAllison \u2019 s husband left his job a few years ago , one with benefits at a big company , to start his own business . Since then they \u2019 ve been buying insurance on the open market , and are now paying around $ 1,100 a month for a policy with a $ 2,500 deductible per family member , with hefty annual premium hikes . One of their two children is not covered under the policy . She has a preexisting condition that would require purchasing additional coverage for $ 600 a month , which would bring the family \u2019 s grand total to around $ 20,000 a year .\nI asked Allison if she \u2019 d shopped on the exchange , to see what a plan might cost under the new law . She said she hadn \u2019 t done so because she \u2019 d heard the website was not working . Would she try it out when it \u2019 s up and running ? Perhaps , she said . She told me she has long opposed Obamacare , and that the president should have focused on tort reform as a solution to bringing down the price of healthcare .\nI tried an experiment and shopped on the exchange for Allison and Kurt . Assuming they do n't smoke and have a household income too high to be eligible for subsidies , I found that they would be able to get a plan for around $ 7,600 , which would include coverage for their uninsured daughter . This would be about a 60 percent reduction from what they would have to pay on the pre-Obamacare market .\nAllison also told me that the letter she received from Blue Cross said that in addition to the policy change for ACA compliance , in the new policy her physician network size might be reduced . That \u2019 s something insurance companies do to save money , with or without Obamacare on the horizon , just as they raise premiums with or without Obamacare coming .\nIf Allison \u2019 s choice of doctor was denied her through Obamacare then , yes , she could have a claim that Obamacare has hurt her . But she \u2019 d also have thousands of dollars in her pocket that she didn \u2019 t have before .\nFinally , I called Robbie and Tina Robison from Franklin , Tenn. Robbie is self-employed as a Christian youth motivational speaker . ( You can see his work here . ) On Hannity , the couple said that they , too , were recently notified that their Blue Cross policy would be expiring for lack of ACA compliance . They told Hannity that the replacement plans Blue Cross was offering would come with a rate increase of 50 percent or even 75 percent , and that the new offerings would contain all sorts of benefits they don \u2019 t need , like maternity care , pediatric care , prenatal care and so forth . Their kids are grown and moved out , so why should they be forced to pay extra for a health plan with superfluous features ?\nWhen I spoke to Robbie , he said he and Tina have been paying a little over $ 800 a month for their plan , about $ 10,000 a year . And the ACA-compliant policy that will cost 50-75 percent more ? They said this information was related to them by their insurance agent .\nHad they shopped on the exchange yet , I asked ? No , Tina said , nor would they . They oppose Obamacare and want nothing to do with it . Fair enough , but they should know that I found a plan for them for , at most , $ 3,700 a year , 63 percent less than their current bill . It might cover things that they don \u2019 t need , but so does every insurance policy .\nIt \u2019 s true that we don \u2019 t know for sure whether certain ills conservatives have warned about will occur once Obamacare is fully enacted . For example , will we truly have the same freedom to choose a physician that we have now ? Will a surplus of insured patients require a scaling back ( or \u201c rationing , \u201d as some call it ) of provided healthcare services ? Will doctors be able to spend as much time with patients ? These are all valid , unanswered questions . The problem is that people like Sean Hannity have decided to answer them now , without evidence . Or worse , with fake evidence .\nI don \u2019 t doubt that these six individuals believe that Obamacare is a disaster ; but none of them had even visited the insurance exchange . And some of them appear to have taken actions ( Paul Cox , for example ) based on a general pessimistic belief about Obamacare . He \u2019 s certainly entitled to do so , but Hannity is not entitled to point to Paul \u2019 s behavior as an \u201c Obamacare train wreck story \u201d and maintain any credibility that he might have as a journalist .\nStrangely , the recent shutdown was based almost entirely on a small percentage of Congress 's belief that Obamacare , as Ted Cruz puts it , \u201c is destroying America. \u201d Cruz has rarely given us an example of what he \u2019 s talking about . That \u2019 s because the best he can do is what Hannity did\u2014exploit people \u2019 s ignorance and falsely point to imaginary boogeymen .\nUpdate : To check the plans I used this useful calculator from the Kaiser Family Foundation .",
