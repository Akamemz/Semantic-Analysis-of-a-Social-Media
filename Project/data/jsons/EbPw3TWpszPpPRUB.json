Nick Rahall , whose state gets 96 percent of its power from coal . Rahall said Thursday that he did n't have specific details about the rule but `` from everything we know we can be sure of this : It will be bad for jobs . ''\nThe rule will be executed at the state level , setting goals for states on reducing carbon emissions but also giving them flexibility on how to meet the new standards .\nStill , putting the new rule into effect is expected to be a long , complicated process that could extend past the 2016 presidential elections and the end of Obama \u2019 s second term in January 2017 .\nThe process includes a one-year-long public comment period . And the president is using a 30-year-old law that was not intended to regulate the gases blamed for global warming .\nHe was forced to rely on the Clean Air Act after he tried and failed to get Congress to pass a new law during his first term . When the Republicans took over the House , the goal became impossible .\nWhile coal-firing plants produce about 40 percent of the electricity in the county , they also create about one-third of the carbon pollution , which makes them the country 's second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases .\n`` There are no national limits to the amount of carbon pollution that existing plants can pump into the air we breathe . None , '' Obama said Saturday in the weekly radio and Internet address .\n`` We limit the amount of toxic chemicals like mercury , sulfur , and arsenic that power plants put in our air and water . But they can dump unlimited amounts of carbon pollution into the air . It 's not smart , it 's not safe , and it does n't make sense . ''\nHis rule will prescribe technological fixes or equipment to be placed on existing plants and require new ones to capture some of their carbon dioxide and bury it underground . States will be allowed to require power plants to make changes such as switching from coal to natural gas or enact other programs to reduce demand for electricity and produce more energy from renewable sources .\nThey also can set up pollution-trading markets as 10 other states already have done to offer more flexibility in how plants cut emissions .",
