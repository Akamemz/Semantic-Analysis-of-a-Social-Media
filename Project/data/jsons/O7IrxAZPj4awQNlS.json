In the U.S. , the death toll is creeping upward as new cases are cropping up across dozens of states .\nMonths into the outbreak , there are still more questions than answers . Here 's what you need to know about COVID-19 .\nSymptoms can range from mild to severe , and some people do n't have any symptoms at all . The most common symptoms resemble the flu and include fever , tiredness and dry cough . Some people also develop aches and pains , nasal congestion , runny nose , sore throat or diarrhea .\nAbout 1 in 6 people becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing , according to the World Health Organization .

What are the similarities and differences ?\nThe Spanish flu , an H1N1 virus , emerged in the wake of WWI and spread across the globe between 1918 and 1919 , infecting about a third of the world 's population . An estimated 50 million people died , with about 675,000 deaths in the U.S. , according to the CDC .\nUnlike COVID-19 , the 1918 pandemic had a high mortality rate among young , healthy people aged 20 to 40 . While the Spanish flu 's mortality rate was at least 2.5 % , with some estimates as high as 10 % , the mortality rate of COVID-19 appears to be closer to 3.4 % , based on reported cases .\nLike COVID-19 , the main protections against the 1918 pandemic included isolation , quarantine , personal hygiene , use of disinfectants , and limitations of public gatherings , according to the CDC .\nCoronaviruses are a large family of viruses , named for their crown-like spikes . In rare cases , coronaviruses in animals have infected people , who spread the virus to other people . That 's what happened with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome , or MERS , and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome , SARS , two far deadlier coronaviruses .\nCOVID-19 , originally called the `` novel coronavirus , '' was first detected in December 2019 . The first infection was linked to a market in Wuhan , China , a city of 11 million people . It 's still unclear how transmission unfolded , but there are several theories .\nSome researchers believe that someone bought contaminated meat at the market , ate it , got sick and infected others . Others say the virus originated in bats , spread to an intermediary animal , and then to humans . Some researchers say pangolins may have been that intermediary host .\nHow is coronavirus spread ? How long does coronavirus stay on surfaces ?\nThe virus is spreading rapidly from person to person , and scientists are still learning more about how it spreads . According to the CDC , the virus spreads between people who are in close contact with one another ( within about 6 feet ) and through respiratory droplets , much like the common cold or flu .\nSee how coronavirus moved from one person to many in a matter of days\nThere 's no evidence that the virus can be transmitted through food , and there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks , according to the CDC .\nIt is , however , possible that a person can get the virus by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own face . A recent study by scientists in the U.S. found that viable virus could be detected up to three hours later in the air , up to four hours on copper , up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 analyzed three case studies that show how the virus was transmitted from person to person .\nThere are no drugs or vaccines for coronaviruses , including COVID-19 . Doctors can only treat the symptoms the viruses cause .\nChinese scientists have decoded the COVID-19 DNA and made it public , and several pharmaceutical companies in the U.S. and abroad are working to develop a vaccine . Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , estimated that a vaccine will be ready within 12 to 18 months .\nTreatment consists of supportive care to help relieve symptoms and , for severe cases , care to support vital organ functions , the CDC says .\nAbout 80 % of people recover from the disease without needing special treatment , according to the WHO . For most patients , that means drinking plenty of fluids and resting , just as you would for the cold or flu .\nPatients are infectious as long as they are `` actively sick . '' But how long someone is actively sick can vary , according to the CDC .\nInformation about how long symptoms last is still evolving . But the February WHO study may give us some preliminary clues :\nThe median time from symptom onset to recovery is about two weeks for mild cases\nFor patients with severe or critical disease , the median recovery time is three to six weeks\nAmong patients who have died , the time from symptom onset to death ranges from two to eight weeks\nIf you 're not quarantined on an air base or cruise ship , the only way to get a coronavirus test is through a health care professional .\nCall your doctor if you have a fever , develop virus symptoms , have recently traveled to an area with an ongoing spread of the virus or have come into contact with a person who is known to have it . You may be asked to wear a mask to the office .\nIf your doctor thinks you might have the coronavirus , he or she will contact the CDC or your local health department for instructions on testing .\nAs of March 16 , 84 state and local public health laboratories in 50 states , the District of Columbia and Guam have successfully verified COVID-19 diagnostic tests and are offering testing , according to the CDC . Both academic labs and large private lab testing companies such as LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics are rolling out coronavirus tests after receiving FDA authorization .\nWhile the CDC initially developed and mailed flawed testing kits , the agency said it fixed the glitch . Now , a new shortage of a key testing component is causing delays .\nMeanwhile , a project funded by billionaire Bill Gates is set to issue at-home testing kits for people who fear they have been infected with the coronavirus .\nHow will it affect our economy ? Will the stock market ever recover ?\nThe COVID-19 outbreak is taking a growing toll on the U.S. economy , and the stock market has fluctuated wildly .\nAt the end of February , the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3,500 points in a single week , and the Dow and S & P 500 had their worst performance in a week since October 2008 . In March , U.S. stocks collapsed again , with the Dow plummeting by more than 2,000 points .\nOn Monday , the market had its worst sell-off in more than three decades . The Dow nosedived 2,999 points , or nearly 13 % , to close at 20,188.52 \u2013 its second-worst percentage loss in history behind the `` Black Monday '' stock market crash in 1987 .\nIn an emergency response , the Federal Reserve cut interest rates on March 3 \u2013 the Fed 's first rate cut between scheduled meetings since the depths of the financial crisis \u2013 and again on Sunday , when the Fed cut short-term interest rates to zero .\nConsider this : Can the Fed save the economy , and your 401k , from the coronavirus ?\nWhat is the Trump administration doing about the epidemic ? What is Mike Pence 's role ?\nAt the end of January , the Trump administration declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a public health emergency in the U.S. and quarantined Americans who had recently been to certain parts of China \u2013 the first quarantine order issued by the federal government in more than 50 years .\nPresident Donald Trump put Vice President Mike Pence in charge of a task force that is coordinating the government 's response to the outbreak . Trump also signed an emergency funding bill to combat the spread of coronavirus in the U.S. and help treat people who become ill . The $ 8.3 billion funding package amounts to one of the largest packages Congress will have passed to combat a global health crisis .\nLast week , Trump said he would use emergency authority to defer payments on federal loans to small businesses and to defer taxes for businesses hurt by coronavirus .\nDozens of confirmed cases have cropped up aboard cruise ships in recent weeks , and many other cases across the U.S. have been linked back to cruises .\nIn February , more than 700 passengers from the Diamond Princess became infected after the ship was held in quarantine off the coast of Japan . Of roughly 300 Americans evacuated from the ship and returned to the United States , 46 tested positive . Though most have ended their 14-day quarantine at U.S. military bases , some have remained in medical isolation as they recover .\nAnother ship , the Grand Princess , finally docked last week after being held off the coast of San Francisco . Of the more than 3,500 people on board , at least two passengers and 19 crew members have tested positive for the virus . Hundreds of Americans on board were expected to be taken to quarantine for two weeks .\nMajor cruise lines including Carnival , Royal Caribbean , Norwegian , and Celebrity announced they would suspend sailing operations to and from U.S. ports for 30 days , Cruise Lines International Association announced Friday .\nCOVID-19 updates in your inbox : Sign up for \u2588\u2588\u2588 's Coronavirus Watch\nIsolation and quarantine are effective ways to help prevent the spread of disease , according to the CDC . Isolation separates sick people with a contagious disease from people who are not sick . Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who were exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick .\nAt least 70 % of America 's schools have shut down . It 's unclear whether the nation 's schools could be closed just for a couple weeks , for months or for the entire rest of the school year .\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday called for limiting gatherings of people to no more than 10 for the next 15 days and suggested school-age students take classes from home . He also said the new normal could last deep into summer . School districts across the nation are scrambling to set up online learning where feasible .\nMore than 100 colleges have canceled in-person classes and moved online .\nConcerts , shows , games and conferences have been canceled and businesses , museums , resorts and theme parks have been closed across the globe to prevent the continued spread of the virus . In the U.S. , individual state and local governments are assessing the risk of large gatherings . So , should you cancel upcoming events , like weddings ?
