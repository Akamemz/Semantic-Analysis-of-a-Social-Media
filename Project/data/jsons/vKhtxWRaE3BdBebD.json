Yet , they do gel with other statements that supposed White House insiders have made about the president \u2019 s view on the national debt .\nIn his recent book , Fear : Trump in the White House , Bob Woodward describes a scene early in Trump \u2019 s presidency in which his then-senior economic adviser , Gary Cohn , met with Trump in the Oval Office .

Cohn shot the president down , according to Woodward ( for his part , Trump denies everything in the book ) .\nEven if it were true , that shouldn \u2019 t matter .

Those who expected Trump , who in another life was proud to be called the \u201c King of Debt , \u201d to be a man of austerity did not understand either what Trump was saying on the campaign trail or what the 62 million Americans who voted for him in 2016 wanted .\nStill , as even the recent Daily Beast article concedes , in the words of presidential spokeswoman , Hogan Gidley , the president has taken action to reduce some of the debt load in the country \u201c including in [ Trump \u2019 s ] first budget that actually would \u2019 ve balanced [ the budget ] in 10 years , a historic , common-sense rescissions proposal . \u201d\nNaturally , this was but a start .
