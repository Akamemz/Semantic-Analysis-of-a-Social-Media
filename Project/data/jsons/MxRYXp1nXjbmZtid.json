However , it was more of an incremental step than Mr. Trump teased earlier in the day , in which he suggested he would try to move American business out of China .\n\u201c We must Balance this very unfair Trading Relationship , \u201d Mr. Trump said on Twitter . \u201c China should not have put new Tariffs on 75 BILLION DOLLARS of United States product ( politically motivated ! ) . \u201d\nA top Republican , Sen. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa , backed Mr. Trump but warned that stiffer tariffs may harm to farmers .\nHe said it \u2019 s up to China , not Mr. Trump , to forge a way out of the standoff .\n\u201c The only way to end this trade war is for China to come to the table and negotiate seriously on an enforceable deal that ends its bad behavior and unfair trade practices . In the meantime , tariffs can not be the only negotiating tool . Tariffs are not a long-term solution , \u201d said Mr. Grassley , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee .\nYet Rep. T.J.
