    "content": "Like many children , Jordan Mallon had lots of ideas about what he wanted to be when he grew up . He harbored dreams of being a professional hockey player or perhaps an artist , and he was fascinated by dinosaurs .\nThen , in the summer of 1993 , Jordan \u2019 s father took him to see \u201c Jurassic Park. \u201d After the credits rolled and the lights came up in the movie theater , 11-year-old Jordan could see his future before him . That night , he said to his mother , \u201c Mom , I want to be a paleontologist . \u201d\n\u201c That was a turning point . That movie really struck a chord with me , \u201d recalls Dr. Mallon , now a dinosaur paleontologist at the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa . \u201c I didn \u2019 t change my focus . Never did I ever waver . \u201d\nAfter \u201c Jurassic Park \u201d premi\u00e8red June 11 , 1993 , tens of millions of people flocked to movie theaters to see the captivating creatures that once roamed the planet . The film ignited a firestorm of public interest in dinosaurs and , by extension , paleontology . This newfound popularity set off a sequence of events that would ultimately bring a flood of new scientists , kick off a golden age of dinosaur discoveries , and forever change paleontology .\n\u201c Paleontology as a field owes a huge debt of gratitude to \u2018 Jurassic Park. \u2019 I think our field would be very , very different today if \u2018 Jurassic Park \u2019 had never happened , \u201d says Steve Brusatte , a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland . In 2013 , the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology presented filmmaker Steven Spielberg with an award to recognize the effect the movie has had on the field .\nTwenty-five years later , the \u201c Jurassic Park \u201d franchise is still captivating audiences . The fifth film in the series , \u201c Jurassic World : Fallen Kingdom , \u201d is set to premi\u00e8re June 22 .\nIt \u2019 s hard to imagine now , but dinosaurs were once seen as sluggish , stupid monsters that were coldblooded evolutionary losers not worthy of study because they had no descendants alive today . In fact , for years the beasts were seen as so boring that when a young Jack Horner , a paleontologist who ultimately advised \u201c Jurassic Park \u201d filmmakers , told a professor that he wanted to study dinosaurs , he was laughed at .\nBut a \u201c dinosaur renaissance \u201d in the 1960s and \u2019 70s gave rise to a new scientific view of dinosaurs as active and intelligent animals that were warmblooded relatives of modern-day birds . It was that new understanding of dinosaurs that set the stage for Michael Crichton \u2019 s 1990 novel , \u201c Jurassic Park. \u201d The film adaptation brought the vision of dinosaurs as dynamic creatures to life in the public eye with groundbreaking computer-generated imagery .\n\u201c They really seemed like they were alive , like they were real animals , \u201d says Thomas Cullen , a postdoctoral research scientist at The Field Museum in Chicago .\nThese silver-screen dinosaurs were no longer creatures emerging from the mist of imaginative mysticism or just boring old bones in museums . Instead , they were animals grounded in the reality of natural history that warranted fascination in their own right .\n\u201c They weren \u2019 t monsters and they weren \u2019 t cartoons , \u201d says Victoria Arbour , a postdoctoral fellow at the Royal Ontario Museum and University of Toronto . \u201c [ The film ] really emphasized dinosaurs as real living creatures that were animals that lived on Earth .... That really inspired me to view them as things that we could learn more about how they lived . \u201d\nCOURTESY OF DAVID EVANS/ ROYAL ONTARIO MUSEUM Victoria Arbour works at an excavation in southern Alberta .\nThese charismatic , prehistoric movie stars energized hordes of moviegoers to learn more about real dinosaurs . Museums saw an influx of visitors to their dinosaur exhibits .\n\u201c One of the best things that \u2018 Jurassic Park \u2019 did for the field was instill or feed this inherent curiosity that we have about dinosaurs , \u201d says Mary Schweitzer , a paleontologist at North Carolina State University in Raleigh .\nAnd the film stirred intrigue in people of all ages , says Matthew Carrano , curator of Dinosauria at the Smithsonian \u2019 s National Museum of Natural History in Washington . \u201c Now adults are as interested as kids . That is a whole demographic change . \u201d\nThe paleontological community saw an opportunity in this newfound popularity to connect the public with science . Documentaries , television shows , books , and other scientific materials abounded .\nBefore the film , \u201c it was a fair bit of work to maintain your interest [ in dinosaurs ] , \u201d Dr. Carrano says . There was only a handful of books and toys out there , and museum exhibits had largely gone without updates for half a century .\n\u201c I would go to the library , and I would read the same books over and over and over , \u201d recalls Carrano , who was in graduate school when \u201c Jurassic Park \u201d came out . But the film \u2019 s popularity changed this in a way that persists today . \u201c I can certainly see how different things are . Now , there \u2019 s perhaps 50 new books a year , conservatively . \u201d\nAll this material in turn generated more excitement , and that fed back into the scientific community . Scientific studies about dinosaurs received more press , paleontologists published more papers , universities began offering courses focused entirely on dinosaurs , and many museums hired dinosaur specialists for the first time .\nFor some dinosaur fans , paleontology \u2019 s new position in the spotlight played a key role in turning a childlike fascination into a more serious interest .\nAndrew Farke discovered the allure of dinosaurs as a 4-year-old and was known in his small South Dakota hometown as \u201c the dinosaur kid. \u201d So when \u201c Jurassic Park \u201d came out when he was 12 , the paleontological discussions that followed crystallized his interest .\n\u201c It was about that time that I transitioned from being a casual dinosaur fan \u2013 I read lots of books \u2013 to really thinking that I wanted to be a paleontologist , \u201d recalls Dr. Farke , now curator of paleontology at the Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology in Claremont , Calif .\nThe young Farke began to write to paleontologists with his own ideas about how dinosaurs may have looked , moved , and eaten . \u201c I didn \u2019 t know it at the time , but that was the start of my professional colleagues and friends , \u201d he says .\nUNIVERSAL PICTURES/AP/FILE In this scene from the 1993 movie \u2018 Jurassic Park , \u2019 Dr. Alan Grant , played by Sam Neill , runs from dinosaurs on the loose .\n\u201c Jurassic Park \u201d made not only dinosaurs cool , but also the scientists who have devoted their lives to studying them . The film offered a fresh view of scientists whom children like Farke might look to as role models .\n\u201c In a lot of movies , scientists are either evil , or they \u2019 re these emotionless , really sterile people , \u201d says Sarah Werning , an assistant professor of anatomy at Des Moines University in Iowa . But in \u201c Jurassic Park , \u201d the scientists were people whom the audience could identify with . Their awe was something the audience shared .\nThe film includes the strong female characters of scientist Ellie Sattler and Lex , the computer-whiz granddaughter of the theme park \u2019 s owner ( portrayed by Laura Dern and Ariana Richards , respectively ) .\n\u201c Having both a male and a female paleontologist in the movie was really important , \u201d says Dr. Arbour , the postdoctoral fellow . And it wasn \u2019 t just Dr. Sattler \u2019 s presence in the film that made a difference , she says : \u201c She \u2019 s presented as very normal . It \u2019 s not weird that she \u2019 s a woman and doing science . They didn \u2019 t make a big deal about it . She was just there , and she was smart , and people respected her . \u201d\nThe surge of scientists entering the field who were touched by \u201c Jurassic Park \u201d helped usher in a wave of new discoveries . From 1984 to 1994 , about 15 new dinosaur species were named each year . That number has risen to about 50 with no sign of slowing down . Some have dubbed this a golden age of discovery .\n\u201c \u2018 Jurassic Park \u2019 came out of a scientific revolution in dinosaur studies , and then it feeds back into one , \u201d Carrano says .\nWith new specimens flooding in over the past quarter century , dinosaurs have proved to be an incredibly diverse group that continually surprises . While some are behemoth carnivores , others are herbivores . Dinosaurs come in all shapes and sizes , too . Some have armorlike scales and clubs for tails , while others have horns or frills or feathers . The relationship between birds and dinosaurs has been better documented as well . Current scientific consensus is that birds are a group of theropod dinosaurs ( so not all dinosaurs died out in the end-Cretaceous mass extinction ) .\nThe popular press and the public have eaten up these discoveries .\nMichelle Stocker grew up with the excitement around \u201c Jurassic Park , \u201d but it wasn \u2019 t until after she became a professional paleontologist that she really felt the influence of the franchise .\n\u201c It \u2019 s the way that much of the public sees paleontology and dinosaurs , \u201d she says . And scientists make use of that . Museum curators can anticipate visitors \u2019 questions and design displays to answer them . Paleontologists can also hold outreach events linked to the latest movie in the franchise .\n\u201c It \u2019 s the point of entry for talking about the science that we do with so many people , \u201d says Dr. Stocker , a paleontologist at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg .\nStill , some paleontologists see the dinosaur frenzy stirred up by the \u201c Jurassic Park \u201d movies as a \u201c double-edged sword , \u201d says Ali Nabavizadeh , an assistant professor of anatomy at Cooper Medical School of Rowan University in Camden , N.J. , because the dinosaurs aren \u2019 t all depicted accurately in the films . \u201c It hypes people up about dinosaurs , but then the kids start believing certain things about how a dinosaur looks or how dinosaurs lived that are not necessarily true . \u201d\nThe original film largely depicted the animals based on scientific models that were current in the early 1990s . But the filmmakers did take some creative liberties . For example , the movie-star raptors were actually large versions of Deinonychus , not Velociraptor . The real Velociraptor was closer to the size of a turkey .\nSome of the original \u201c Jurassic Park \u201d dinosaurs are now outdated , too , thanks to new scientific discoveries . With the view back then of dinosaurs as particularly agile and energetic , it wasn \u2019 t a stretch to imagine a speedy Tyrannosaurus rex that could run down a Jeep with three tasty humans in it . But subsequent research found that the body mechanics of T. rex was such that a quick-footed human could probably outrun the dinosaur .\nThe latest criticism comes from scientists irked that dinosaurs now known to have had feathers ( like Velociraptor ) haven \u2019 t gotten an updated look in the most recent films .\nBut paleontologists can also leverage those inaccuracies to explain to the interested public how they know what they know \u2013 or don \u2019 t \u2013 about how a dinosaur looked and acted from examining fossils .\nIn that sense , dinosaurs can be a gateway to science more generally . \u201c If you use dinosaurs correctly , you feed the hunger for how we do science , \u201d says Dr. Schweitzer at North Carolina State .\nThat \u2019 s just what happened for Rowan University \u2019 s Dr. Nabavizadeh as a child . After seeing \u201c Jurassic Park \u201d as a 6-year-old , \u201c the excitement I got in seeing the dinosaurs alive and in the flesh made me start to wonder , was this really what they looked like ? \u201d he says . \u201c How can we tell anatomically ? Were there special features that we don \u2019 t know about just from the bones ? \u201d\nSomething similar happened for Thomas Adams , although he was no longer a child in 1993 . Dr. Adams was 25 and managing record stores when the film came out . All the hubbub prompted him to change careers .\n\u201c People don \u2019 t believe me when I say it , [ but ] I became a paleontologist because of \u2018 Jurassic Park , \u2019 \u201d says Adams , who is now curator of paleontology and geology at the Witte Museum in San Antonio .\nAdams had disliked school in his youth , but \u201c Jurassic Park \u201d sparked a kind of academic curiosity he had never experienced before .\n\u201c I found that if you have this passion for something , everything else you learn is so important and so relevant to what you \u2019 re doing that it makes it fun to learn , \u201d Adams says . \u201c I rediscovered learning . \u201d",
