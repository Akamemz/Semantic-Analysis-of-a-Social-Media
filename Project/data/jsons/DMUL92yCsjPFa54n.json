Review the previous three installments , from guns to trade , here .\nHow one Atlanta street is trying to rewrite Ferguson 's legacy\nAtlanta \u2013 Not long after Mike Costello moved into a brick ranch on Ericson Street , he was helping the cable guy at his house when shots rang out .\nAs a cop , Mr. Costello knew exactly what the pops were . At first , he couldn \u2019 t see anything amiss , but then Raymond Hinton came running fast around the corner .\nEveryone on Ericson Street knew Ray . Wherever he was , trouble usually wasn \u2019 t far behind . And just as surely , everyone knew Costello was the new white cop next door .\nIn that moment , as the two men stood looking at each other in the echo of gunfire , the gears of America \u2019 s debate on race clicked into place . Too often , those encounters have ended in death and national upheaval .\nOn this day , Mr. Hinton turned tail and ran . But the thing was , he was the one shot .\nThe story of Atlanta \u2019 s Ericson Street , in many ways , is a picture of why America remains so racially divided \u2013 but also of how it might be able to overcome that and put itself together .\nCIVICS 101 : How the North forced the South to grant blacks citizenship\nFor the first eight decades of American government under the US Constitution , slavery was legal in at least some of the country . African-Americans were not considered citizens , were not allowed to vote , and were counted as 3/5ths of a person for purposes of apportioning congressional representation .\nThat changed after the Civil War with the passage of the 13th , 14th , and 15th Amendments . The first abolished slavery , the next granted citizenship to all born or naturalized in the US and added that no state shall \u201c deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law , \u201d and the last gave all adult men the right to vote . However , these amendments were passed under unusual circumstances .\nThroughout the process , the Southern states were barred from representation in Congress . When some Southern state legislatures ratified the 13th amendment , Congress counted their votes to achieve the three-quarters majority necessary .\nBut when a number of southern states rejected the 14th Amendment , Congress refused to count those negative votes . Instead , it imposed military rule on the South and made ratification of the 14th Amendment a condition for ending military rule and entitling the southern states to again be represented in Congress .\nIn the wake of the Civil War , the Southern states passed a series of measures known as the Jim Crow laws that restricted the public and civic activities of blacks . That doctrine of \u201c separate but equal \u201d was essentially codified with the 1896 Supreme Court case Plessy v. Ferguson . Legalized segregation continued in the South until the 1954 case Brown v. Board of Education declared that doctrine unconstitutional in America \u2019 s public schools .\nThe 14th amendment has been the most litigated amendment in US history . In addition to cases involving racial issues , it has also been referenced in those concerning social issues such as abortion and gay marriage . Due to the special circumstances around its ratification , some have called into question its constitutionality . But the Supreme Court approved its ratification in the 1939 case Coleman v. Millerand today it is widely considered a foundation of modern constitutional law .\nSources : the Hillary Clinton campaign , the Jill Stein campaign , the Guardian , CBS News , ISideWith.com , and OnTheIssues\nPHOTO GALLERY : 9 Americans on how we can each improve race relations\nWe do n't fully understand a topic unless we can argue the other side , and we ca n't effectively move forward together if we do n't really listen to each other and have a respectful conversation .
