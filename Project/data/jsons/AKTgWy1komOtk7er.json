Climate change doesn \u2019 t let him plan that far into the future .\n\u201c I can \u2019 t think more than 16 months out .

Their mission is twofold : trying to force politicians to act on one of the most dire issues facing humankind and building an army of young people to send the message .\nAfter they spend their days working at the Sunrise office in downtown DC or meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill , they come home to share vegetarian meals at their table each night .

( The Sunrise Movement doesn \u2019 t have formal membership . ) But its core leaders \u2014 a small group of activists in their mid-20s \u2014 estimate that 15,000 young people have showed up to in-person actions across the country and that 80,000 have participated in less direct actions such as emailing and calling their representatives . As of this month , the group has 290 small , autonomous chapters of activists ( called \u201c hubs \u201d ) across the country . In November 2018 , there were just 11 .\nThe 15,000 people who have turned out in person have spent the past year occupying the offices and hallways of the US Capitol , state houses , and Democratic National Committee meetings across the country , yelling at the top of their lungs .\nTheir methods are straight out of the playbook of the civil rights movement of the 1960s : Frequently , they sing protest songs .

These would-be young voters have pushed Democrats running for president to release serious , detailed plans to drastically cut America \u2019 s fossil fuel emissions .\nThese recent college graduates are forgoing the entry-level professional jobs their peers get to throw themselves into climate activism full-time . Everyone in the DC apartment is in their early or mid-20s ; no one has a permanent plan , other than working like hell to try to stop climate change .\n\u201c Traditional adult markers of getting a house , getting married , having kids ... that \u2019 s 11 years , \u201d said housemate Lauren Maunus , tallying up how long it might have taken her , under more ordinary circumstances , to achieve them all . Eleven years has a different significance for her and her friends ; it marks the year 2030 , the deadline set by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for countries worldwide to drastically lower their emissions or suffer the effects of a climate catastrophe after average worldwide temperatures pass 1.5 or 2 degrees celsius .\nSome of those effects are already apparent . Hurricane Dorian wreaked devastation on the Bahamas , and wildfires are raging worldwide , from the Amazon to Siberian forests and the western United States . It can also be felt closer to home ; the day I interviewed the group in early September , it was a sweltering 96 degrees in Washington , DC , a new heat record for that date .\nThe stakes are high this year . The administration of President Donald Trump , a climate-change denier , is doing everything it can to roll back environmental standards .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve got to lay it all out on the line over the next year , \u201d Campion said . His housemates nod gravely .\nSunrise has been incredibly effective at drawing attention to climate\nSunrise is known for two things : how young it is , and how effective it has been so quickly .\nThe group was born out of the college divestment movement , in which student activists pushed administrators to divest assets and holdings from fossil fuel companies . Sunrise co-founder and executive director Varshini Prakash spearheaded the movement at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst , using protests and sit-ins to accomplish the goal . Fellow Sunrise founders Sara Blazevic and Stephen O \u2019 Hanlon ( now the group \u2019 s managing director and spokesperson , respectively ) helped lead the divestment movement at Swarthmore College , while organizing director Dyanna Jaye did the same at the University of Virginia .\nIn 2013 , the rough outline of a Green New Deal was being drafted by Sunrise co-founder and current political director Evan Weber when he was a senior at Wesleyan University . Their project was a response to then-President Barack Obama \u2019 s Climate Action Plan , which Weber believed was \u201c wholly insufficient to tackle the climate crisis. \u201d He and his co-authors , fellow student Matthew Lichtash and then-visiting professor and environmentalist Michael Dorsey , wanted to put out an alternative vision that was much bolder in scope .\n\u201c We started coming up with an idea . What would it look like to actually demand action at the scale that was needed and put forward solutions actually at the scale of the problem ? \u201d Weber , 27 , said . Their report made some waves as a dissenting voice criticizing a Democratic administration on climate , and Weber started noticing young people in particular were latching onto their idea . Soon after , he met Jaye at the 2014 People \u2019 s Climate March in New York City .\nSunrise \u2019 s co-founders spent much of 2016 preparing for Hillary Clinton \u2019 s election . The rise of Donald Trump raised the stakes dramatically .\n\u201c Our old plan exploded , and when the dust settled , one thing was crystal clear : We \u2019 ve got ta figure out how to win some elections , \u201d Prakash and Jaye wrote in a 2017 Medium post . \u201c Trump \u2019 s victory has blown over the barriers between young people and political engagement , pointing towards the possibility of a sea change at every level of government . \u201d\nThe group officially launched in April 2017 with some grant seed money from the Sierra Club and 350.org . But the world first took notice of Sunrise on November 13 , 2018 , when 200 of its activists filed into incoming Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2019 s office and refused to leave .\nThe protesters sang and shouted in the hallways of the Cannon Office Building . They weren \u2019 t asking for action on climate ; they were demanding it . They got a high-profile boost from progressive star and representative-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D-NY ) , who stopped by to high-five them and encourage them to keep up their work . They stayed for hours , continuing even after police arrested 51 of them .\n\u201c It felt like divine intervention , \u201d Weber said . \u201c No members of Congress gave a shit about what we did before we occupied Nancy Pelosi \u2019 s office , and now we \u2019 re one of the most influential groups in the progressive movement that almost every single presidential candidate has reached out to before releasing their climate plans . \u201d\nSince 2017 , the group has called on state and national politicians to forgo donations from fossil fuel companies . It has taken its occupations to state houses around the country , calling for Green New Deals on the state level . A month after occupying Pelosi \u2019 s office , Sunrise came back to Congress with 1,000 young people , quintupling the size of the protest .\nAnd this month , the activists of Sunrise will join thousands \u2014 perhaps even millions \u2014 of other young people in global youth climate strikes calling for action on climate change . The Global Climate Strike , set for September 20 and 27 , aims to capitalize on the United Nations Climate Action Summit on September 23 . The protests are being organized by multiple groups , including Swedish activist Greta Thunberg \u2019 s Fridays for Future , and the US Youth Climate Strike ( a group led by Isra Hirsi , the 16-year-old daughter of Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota ) .\n\u201c I \u2019 m incredibly excited . I think the youth mobilization and the mobilization of environmental activists and frontline mobilization as well , that kind of activism is what \u2019 s actually moving a lot of the legislative agenda on climate and making it much more pressing , \u201d Ocasio-Cortez told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c I think their work has been invaluable , there \u2019 s no way we \u2019 d be in this moment without groups like Sunrise and Climate Justice Alliance . \u201d\nThe group has also done electoral work that has paid off , especially in state and local elections . They and other local activist groups helped elect progressive politicians to the New York state legislature , which passed the wide-reaching Climate & Communities Protection Act this summer ( many view the state law as a precursor to a Green New Deal ) .\nSunrise caught lightning in a bottle ; the climate is a growing concern for many voters , especially Democrats . A July Pew Research Center survey showed that 84 percent of Democrats surveyed are worried about climate change . Republicans aren \u2019 t nearly as concerned , but polling shows rising climate anxiety among young Republicans . A global poll by Glocalities showed 67 percent of US Republicans ages 18 to 34 \u201c agreed \u201d or \u201c strongly agreed \u201d humans were causing damage to the planet .\nThis speaks to the fact that climate is a huge generational issue . A May Gallup poll showed 70 percent of Americans ages 18 to 34 were worried \u201c a great deal \u201d or \u201c a fair amount \u201d about climate change , compared to 56 percent of Americans 55 and older .\n\u201c It creates an aggrieved party , \u201d said Andy Hoffman , a professor of sustainable enterprise at the University of Michigan . \u201c It \u2019 s young people , it \u2019 s their future . I do think that \u2019 s significant in terms of getting a group to cluster around a common cause , to say , \u2018 I am being harmed . \u2019 \u201d\nWith the effects of climate change so noticeable and with a climate-change denier in the White House , it makes sense for a coalition of young people to come together in the US , Europe , and elsewhere around the globe to demand action on climate . Their message is clear : If older generations won \u2019 t do anything , we will .\n\u201c We have grown up our entire lives watching this issue completely sidelined in the political discourse , \u201d said Prakash , 26 . The recent attention on climate policy \u201c is not because members of the media or political establishment woke up one day . It is a direct result of the active energy and the demand from thousands of young people on the front lines of the crisis . \u201d\nThis has most recently been seen in the group \u2019 s work to secure a climate change forum on national television . Despite the Democratic National Committee voting down a climate-specific presidential debate , major networks like CNN and MSNBC stepped up to fill the void after months of Sunrise activists protesting , showing up to DNC meetings , and tweeting . CNN recently held a seven-hour climate town hall \u2014 the longest , most substantial discussion of climate change ever held on primetime television . MSNBC is set to hold another one on September 19 .\nAnd media attention begets policy ; the day before the CNN town hall , Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren , Kamala Harris , Pete Buttigieg , and Julian Castro put forward a fresh wave of climate change plans , joining much of the rest of the field . Climate experts and even presidential candidates including Beto O \u2019 Rourke credited Sunrise with making the change , saying \u201c they have forced those in power , and those in public trust , to solve these challenges . \u201d\nThough Warren didn \u2019 t address Sunrise by name , she filmed a short video after the forum thanking youth climate protesters for their persistence .\n\u201c The best part was who was in the audience ; it was a bunch of young people who made it happen , \u201d Warren said , comparing youth activists to generations of civil rights marchers , suffragettes , and LGBTQ activists that came before them . \u201c They \u2019 re going to make their voices heard in 2020 . \u201d\nAs the youth climate movement rises to prominence , older groups in the environmental movement are grappling with where exactly they went wrong on climate change .\n\u201c The movement has evolved , because it wasn \u2019 t working . We \u2019 re losing , \u201d Greenpeace USA executive director Annie Leonard said . \u201c The science is stronger than ever , and we \u2019 re still losing . \u201d\nWhat \u2019 s been missing , according to Leonard , is a mass movement to galvanize public sentiment on climate change . Older groups have historically pursued their own projects , such as land conservation , protecting endangered species , or trying to ban plastic bags . Few have been as overtly political as Sunrise , and few have been able to offer as succinct a tagline as a Green New Deal for their proposed climate change solution .\n\u201c The environmental movement started with talking about climate change as an environmental issue , and I think still in a lot of ways is stuck in that box , \u201d said Susan Ruffo , the executive director of the Circulate Initiative , who formerly worked at the Nature Conservancy and Ocean Conservancy . \u201c It \u2019 s still stuck in that box , the classic picture of a polar bear . It \u2019 s much more about the future and their lives , and not as much about , \u2018 This is an environmental issue . \u2019 \u201d\nSunrise sees itself as more akin to the civil rights movement of the 1960s or the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011 than it does to older environmental groups . It does draw similarity from 350.org , the group founded by environmentalist Bill McKibben and a group of college students also active in the divestment movement .\n\u201c It takes time to build movements , \u201d McKibben said in an email interview . \u201c We \u2019 ve gone from the place where we could organize small , scattered protests a decade ago , to putting 400,000 people in the streets in New York in 2014 [ during the People \u2019 s Climate March ] to events like the big all-ages climate strike coming on Sept. 20 , which I imagine will be the largest day of climate action yet . \u201d\nPart of the reason Sunrise has been so effective is the way it communicates the scale of the crisis . This component is important because Republicans and fossil fuel companies successfully muddled the message for years , claiming climate change either wasn \u2019 t happening , or wasn \u2019 t manmade . The environmental movement thought science would convince the public , but that hasn \u2019 t worked , in part because scientists aren \u2019 t the best messengers .\n\u201c They \u2019 re not very effective , \u201d said Leah Stokes , a political science professor at the University of California Santa Barbara , who studies environmental movements . \u201c Scientists trade on uncertainties and caveats . We needed a voice to say climate change is happening now , and get that into the media and public consciousness . \u201d\nRather than focusing on abstract or far-away things like melting ice caps in the Arctic or rising CO2 levels that no one can see , Sunrise strategically focuses on something much more immediate and \u2014 in some ways \u2014 selfish . It homes in on what climate change will do to humans .\n\u201c I know a very small number of people who get very excited about decarbonization as a thing , \u201d Prakash told me . What she and her colleagues at Sunrise are trying to get at is their vision for solving climate change through massive mobilization and , most importantly , the creation of green jobs .\n\u201c Those are things people intuitively understand because they relate to their everyday lives , \u201d Prakash said . \u201c I feel like climate activists are always frustrated people don \u2019 t care about their issue ... the problem is we \u2019 re not listening to what people care about . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s not to discount the work of past environmental groups , which Leonard , the executive director of Greenpeace US , calls \u201c formidable . \u201d\n\u201c Forests still standing , chemicals banned . The world is a better place because Greenpeace did that work , and if we did the same things in the next 50 years , we \u2019 re toast , \u201d she said . \u201c It \u2019 s not enough . \u201d\nSunrise \u2019 s purpose over the past year has been championing the Green New Deal . But the difference between laying out the boldest vision and actually passing something Democrats and Republicans \u2014 or even just liberal and moderate Democrats \u2014 can agree on are two totally different things .\nAs it stands , the Green New Deal is a broad framework rather than a single piece of legislation . It aims to make the United States carbon neutral by 2030 , turning the country into a global leader of renewable energy along the way . It \u2019 s no accident the Green New Deal takes its name from Franklin Delano Roosevelt \u2019 s New Deal ; it would amount to a massive transformation of the US economy , calling for everything from making every residential and industrial building energy efficient , to decarbonizing major industries and infrastructure . It aims to create millions of jobs in the process , a key component of the plan that Sunrise leaders believe will boost its chances with moderates and Republicans .\nBut Sunrise \u2019 s hopes for enacting a Green New Deal rest on everything going right for Democrats in 2020 . Democrats would need to win the White House , keep the House , and win the Senate ( where they would either have to win by a large margin or abolish the filibuster to get big pieces of legislation through ) .\n\u201c I think that getting climate change legislation done is doable , \u201d former Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid , who supports abolishing the filibuster , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 recently . \u201c If we have a Democratic Congress and president that will make it a lot easier , and that \u2019 s an understatement . \u201d\nActivists are under no impression that they \u2019 ll get everything they want , but they act like they will .\n\u201c We believe the people in power are ultimately most responsive to power , \u201d Weber said . \u201c We believe you can shift the terrain of what \u2019 s possible by shifting the conversation and by building power . \u201d\nAhead of the election , Sunrise plans to use the climate issue to mobilize thousands of young people across the country to get out and vote for a Democratic president and lawmakers . They will turn activists participating in the September climate strikes into get-out-the-vote leaders ahead of November 2020 . To mobilize youth voters , the number of movement houses like the one in Northwest DC is planned to grow in pivotal states for the next presidential election .\nThere are plenty of Democratic members of Congress who are content nibbling around the edges of climate policy and concerned with passing a bipartisan package that Republicans can get on board with . And even the most moderate Republicans on climate regard the Green New Deal as a pipe dream .\n\u201c We \u2019 re grateful to [ Sunrise ] raising the salience of the issue , but it \u2019 s vital conservatives hear the message of climate action in their own language , rather than the language of the left , because it \u2019 s a totally different language , \u201d said former South Carolina Rep. Bob Inglis , who founded RepublicEN , a Republican climate group working to persuade the GOP to act on climate . \u201c It \u2019 s a language of scarcity , doing less . It \u2019 s a left-tilting , moralistic message . And we talk about energy abundance and the power of the free enterprise system to deliver innovation . \u201d\nWe \u2019 re far from knowing whether these discussions will even be able to take place . If Donald Trump is reelected in 2020 , they most certainly won \u2019 t . But Sunrise is preparing for the alternative scenario , continuing to needle members of Congress by whatever means necessary .\n\u201c Sunrise should keep doing what it \u2019 s doing . It \u2019 s not their job to be reasonable and cultivate favor with Republican leaders , \u201d Stokes said .\nA number of Sunrise members talk about the concept of \u201c millennial dread \u201d or \u201c millennial nihilism , \u201d the sense that things are bad and won \u2019 t get better for younger generations . That encompasses a lot of things , like student loan debt and the inability to save enough to buy a home , but the climate crisis is a huge part of it .\nJoanna Zhu , one of the DC house activists , tells me about a dark joke circulating among her friends : \u201c I don \u2019 t have a 401 ( k ) . I \u2019 m just counting on the apocalypse taking me out sometime soon . \u201d\nAnd so , at its essence , Sunrise is a group of scared young people looking for a way to do something . While they \u2019 ve speedily become savvy , they are kids \u2014 not seasoned activists .\n\u201c I \u2019 d say a lot of our members are showing up for the first time , \u201d Weber , the Sunrise political director , told me . \u201c They \u2019 re young adults that are just kind of freaked out about the climate crisis and political moment we \u2019 re in. \u201d Sunrise \u2019 s name alludes to that feeling , that the night is always darkest before the dawn of a new day . The youth are scared , but they \u2019 re also hopeful .\nAlmost every Sunrise member of the DC house has a story about how climate dramatically made a mark on their lives .\nMaunus grew up in Palm City , Florida , which had back-to-back Category 3 and 4 hurricanes when she was in the fourth grade . After one of the storms hit , she and her sister took inner tubes and floated down their street like it was a waterpark . They were the lucky ones ; their house was still standing , she told me .\nFor Christian Galo from Houston , it was another hurricane . Hurricane Mitch slammed into his family \u2019 s home country of Honduras in 1998 as a Category 5 storm , killing more than 7,000 people and displacing thousands more .\n\u201c Most of my mom \u2019 s family ended up moving outside of Honduras as refugees after , \u201d Galo told me . \u201c Just thinking how vulnerable those populations are now , it feels more urgent now with the migrant crisis. \u201d In 2017 , he was afraid for his family again as they took shelter from Hurricane Harvey , when the storm dumped more than four feet of rain on Houston .\nGabbi Pierce remembers the earthquakes that started in her hometown of Wichita , Kansas , after oil and gas companies started fracking there . ( Wichita is home base for Koch Industries . )\n\u201c Kansas had never had earthquakes , but around the time I was 14-15 , that was the time I felt my first earthquake in Kansas , \u201d she said . A few years later , when she moved to California , she witnessed the wildfires near Los Angeles and the clouds of smoke rolling over the mountains .\n\u201c I could smell the smoke in the air , everyone was walking past wearing masks , \u201d Pierce said . \u201c Dimming out the sun , it was apocalyptic . \u201d\nIt was Galo who summed up why they were all in DC , working with Sunrise : \u201c I would not know how to live with myself if I were not involved . \u201d\nElla Nilsen covers the 2020 election and Congress for \u2588\u2588\u2588 .

Their project was a response to then-President Barack Obama\u2019s Climate Action Plan, which Weber believed was \u201cwholly insufficient to tackle the climate crisis.\u201d He and his co-authors, fellow student Matthew Lichtash and then-visiting professor and environmentalist Michael Dorsey, wanted to put out an alternative vision that was much bolder in scope.\n\n\u201cWe started coming up with an idea. What would it look like to actually demand action at the scale that was needed and put forward solutions actually at the scale of the problem?\u201d Weber, 27, said. Their report made some waves as a dissenting voice criticizing a Democratic administration on climate, and Weber started noticing young people in particular were latching onto their idea. Soon after, he met Jaye at the 2014 People\u2019s Climate March in New York City.\n\nSunrise\u2019s co-founders spent much of 2016 preparing for Hillary Clinton\u2019s election. The rise of Donald Trump raised the stakes dramatically.\n\n\u201cOur old plan exploded, and when the dust settled, one thing was crystal clear: We\u2019ve gotta figure out how to win some elections,\u201d Prakash and Jaye wrote in a 2017 Medium post. \u201cTrump\u2019s victory has blown over the barriers between young people and political engagement, pointing towards the possibility of a sea change at every level of government.\u201d\n\nThe group officially launched in April 2017 with some grant seed money from the Sierra Club and 350.org. But the world first took notice of Sunrise on November 13, 2018, when 200 of its activists filed into incoming Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office and refused to leave.\n\nThe protesters sang and shouted in the hallways of the Cannon Office Building. They weren\u2019t asking for action on climate; they were demanding it. They got a high-profile boost from progressive star and representative-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who stopped by to high-five them and encourage them to keep up their work. They stayed for hours, continuing even after police arrested 51 of them.\n\n\u201cIt felt like divine intervention,\u201d Weber said. \u201cNo members of Congress gave a shit about what we did before we occupied Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office, and now we\u2019re one of the most influential groups in the progressive movement that almost every single presidential candidate has reached out to before releasing their climate plans.\u201d\n\nSince 2017, the group has called on state and national politicians to forgo donations from fossil fuel companies. It has taken its occupations to state houses around the country, calling for Green New Deals on the state level. A month after occupying Pelosi\u2019s office, Sunrise came back to Congress with 1,000 young people, quintupling the size of the protest.\n\nAnd this month, the activists of Sunrise will join thousands \u2014 perhaps even millions \u2014 of other young people in global youth climate strikes calling for action on climate change. The Global Climate Strike, set for September 20 and 27, aims to capitalize on the United Nations Climate Action Summit on September 23. The protests are being organized by multiple groups, including Swedish activist Greta Thunberg\u2019s Fridays for Future, and the US Youth Climate Strike (a group led by Isra Hirsi, the 16-year-old daughter of Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m incredibly excited. I think the youth mobilization and the mobilization of environmental activists and frontline mobilization as well, that kind of activism is what\u2019s actually moving a lot of the legislative agenda on climate and making it much more pressing,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told Vox. \u201cI think their work has been invaluable, there\u2019s no way we\u2019d be in this moment without groups like Sunrise and Climate Justice Alliance.\u201d\n\nThe group has also done electoral work that has paid off, especially in state and local elections. They and other local activist groups helped elect progressive politicians to the New York state legislature, which passed the wide-reaching Climate & Communities Protection Act this summer (many view the state law as a precursor to a Green New Deal).\n\nSunrise caught lightning in a bottle; the climate is a growing concern for many voters, especially Democrats. A July Pew Research Center survey showed that 84 percent of Democrats surveyed are worried about climate change. Republicans aren\u2019t nearly as concerned, but polling shows rising climate anxiety among young Republicans. A global poll by Glocalities showed 67 percent of US Republicans ages 18 to 34 \u201cagreed\u201d or \u201cstrongly agreed\u201d humans were causing damage to the planet.\n\nThis speaks to the fact that climate is a huge generational issue. A May Gallup poll showed 70 percent of Americans ages 18 to 34 were worried \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201ca fair amount\u201d about climate change, compared to 56 percent of Americans 55 and older.\n\n\u201cIt creates an aggrieved party,\u201d said Andy Hoffman, a professor of sustainable enterprise at the University of Michigan. \u201cIt\u2019s young people, it\u2019s their future. I do think that\u2019s significant in terms of getting a group to cluster around a common cause, to say, \u2018I am being harmed.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith the effects of climate change so noticeable and with a climate-change denier in the White House, it makes sense for a coalition of young people to come together in the US, Europe, and elsewhere around the globe to demand action on climate. Their message is clear: If older generations won\u2019t do anything, we will.\n\n\u201cWe have grown up our entire lives watching this issue completely sidelined in the political discourse,\u201d said Prakash, 26. The recent attention on climate policy \u201cis not because members of the media or political establishment woke up one day. It is a direct result of the active energy and the demand from thousands of young people on the front lines of the crisis.\u201d\n\nThis has most recently been seen in the group\u2019s work to secure a climate change forum on national television. Despite the Democratic National Committee voting down a climate-specific presidential debate, major networks like CNN and MSNBC stepped up to fill the void after months of Sunrise activists protesting, showing up to DNC meetings, and tweeting. CNN recently held a seven-hour climate town hall \u2014 the longest, most substantial discussion of climate change ever held on primetime television. MSNBC is set to hold another one on September 19.\n\nAnd media attention begets policy; the day before the CNN town hall, Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, and Julian Castro put forward a fresh wave of climate change plans, joining much of the rest of the field. Climate experts and even presidential candidates including Beto O\u2019Rourke credited Sunrise with making the change, saying \u201cthey have forced those in power, and those in public trust, to solve these challenges.\u201d\n\nThough Warren didn\u2019t address Sunrise by name, she filmed a short video after the forum thanking youth climate protesters for their persistence.\n\n\u201cThe best part was who was in the audience; it was a bunch of young people who made it happen,\u201d Warren said, comparing youth activists to generations of civil rights marchers, suffragettes, and LGBTQ activists that came before them. \u201cThey\u2019re going to make their voices heard in 2020.\u201d\n\nSunrise\u2019s place in the larger environmental movement\n\nAs the youth climate movement rises to prominence, older groups in the environmental movement are grappling with where exactly they went wrong on climate change.\n\n\u201cThe movement has evolved, because it wasn\u2019t working. We\u2019re losing,\u201d Greenpeace USA executive director Annie Leonard said. \u201cThe science is stronger than ever, and we\u2019re still losing.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s been missing, according to Leonard, is a mass movement to galvanize public sentiment on climate change. Older groups have historically pursued their own projects, such as land conservation, protecting endangered species, or trying to ban plastic bags. Few have been as overtly political as Sunrise, and few have been able to offer as succinct a tagline as a Green New Deal for their proposed climate change solution.\n\n\u201cThe environmental movement started with talking about climate change as an environmental issue, and I think still in a lot of ways is stuck in that box,\u201d said Susan Ruffo, the executive director of the Circulate Initiative, who formerly worked at the Nature Conservancy and Ocean Conservancy. \u201cIt\u2019s still stuck in that box, the classic picture of a polar bear. It\u2019s much more about the future and their lives, and not as much about, \u2018This is an environmental issue.\u2019\u201d\n\nSunrise sees itself as more akin to the civil rights movement of the 1960s or the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011 than it does to older environmental groups. It does draw similarity from 350.org, the group founded by environmentalist Bill McKibben and a group of college students also active in the divestment movement.\n\n\u201cIt takes time to build movements,\u201d McKibben said in an email interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from the place where we could organize small, scattered protests a decade ago, to putting 400,000 people in the streets in New York in 2014 [during the People\u2019s Climate March] to events like the big all-ages climate strike coming on Sept. 20, which I imagine will be the largest day of climate action yet.\u201d\n\nPart of the reason Sunrise has been so effective is the way it communicates the scale of the crisis. This component is important because Republicans and fossil fuel companies successfully muddled the message for years, claiming climate change either wasn\u2019t happening, or wasn\u2019t manmade. The environmental movement thought science would convince the public, but that hasn\u2019t worked, in part because scientists aren\u2019t the best messengers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not very effective,\u201d said Leah Stokes, a political science professor at the University of California Santa Barbara, who studies environmental movements. \u201cScientists trade on uncertainties and caveats. We needed a voice to say climate change is happening now, and get that into the media and public consciousness.\u201d\n\nRather than focusing on abstract or far-away things like melting ice caps in the Arctic or rising CO2 levels that no one can see, Sunrise strategically focuses on something much more immediate and \u2014 in some ways \u2014 selfish. It homes in on what climate change will do to humans.\n\n\u201cI know a very small number of people who get very excited about decarbonization as a thing,\u201d Prakash told me. What she and her colleagues at Sunrise are trying to get at is their vision for solving climate change through massive mobilization and, most importantly, the creation of green jobs.\n\n\u201cThose are things people intuitively understand because they relate to their everyday lives,\u201d Prakash said. \u201cI feel like climate activists are always frustrated people don\u2019t care about their issue ... the problem is we\u2019re not listening to what people care about.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not to discount the work of past environmental groups, which Leonard, the executive director of Greenpeace US, calls \u201cformidable.\u201d\n\n\u201cForests still standing, chemicals banned. The world is a better place because Greenpeace did that work, and if we did the same things in the next 50 years, we\u2019re toast,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough.\u201d\n\nSunrise has a bold, controversial five-year plan\n\nSunrise\u2019s purpose over the past year has been championing the Green New Deal. But the difference between laying out the boldest vision and actually passing something Democrats and Republicans \u2014 or even just liberal and moderate Democrats \u2014 can agree on are two totally different things.\n\nAs it stands, the Green New Deal is a broad framework rather than a single piece of legislation. It aims to make the United States carbon neutral by 2030, turning the country into a global leader of renewable energy along the way. It\u2019s no accident the Green New Deal takes its name from Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal; it would amount to a massive transformation of the US economy, calling for everything from making every residential and industrial building energy efficient, to decarbonizing major industries and infrastructure. It aims to create millions of jobs in the process, a key component of the plan that Sunrise leaders believe will boost its chances with moderates and Republicans.\n\nBut Sunrise\u2019s hopes for enacting a Green New Deal rest on everything going right for Democrats in 2020. Democrats would need to win the White House, keep the House, and win the Senate (where they would either have to win by a large margin or abolish the filibuster to get big pieces of legislation through).\n\n\u201cI think that getting climate change legislation done is doable,\u201d former Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, who supports abolishing the filibuster, told Vox recently. \u201cIf we have a Democratic Congress and president that will make it a lot easier, and that\u2019s an understatement.\u201d\n\nActivists are under no impression that they\u2019ll get everything they want, but they act like they will.\n\n\u201cWe believe the people in power are ultimately most responsive to power,\u201d Weber said. \u201cWe believe you can shift the terrain of what\u2019s possible by shifting the conversation and by building power.\u201d\n\nAhead of the election, Sunrise plans to use the climate issue to mobilize thousands of young people across the country to get out and vote for a Democratic president and lawmakers. They will turn activists participating in the September climate strikes into get-out-the-vote leaders ahead of November 2020. To mobilize youth voters, the number of movement houses like the one in Northwest DC is planned to grow in pivotal states for the next presidential election.\n\nThere are plenty of Democratic members of Congress who are content nibbling around the edges of climate policy and concerned with passing a bipartisan package that Republicans can get on board with. And even the most moderate Republicans on climate regard the Green New Deal as a pipe dream.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re grateful to [Sunrise] raising the salience of the issue, but it\u2019s vital conservatives hear the message of climate action in their own language, rather than the language of the left, because it\u2019s a totally different language,\u201d said former South Carolina Rep. Bob Inglis, who founded RepublicEN, a Republican climate group working to persuade the GOP to act on climate. \u201cIt\u2019s a language of scarcity, doing less. It\u2019s a left-tilting, moralistic message. And we talk about energy abundance and the power of the free enterprise system to deliver innovation.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re far from knowing whether these discussions will even be able to take place. If Donald Trump is reelected in 2020, they most certainly won\u2019t. But Sunrise is preparing for the alternative scenario, continuing to needle members of Congress by whatever means necessary.\n\n\u201cSunrise should keep doing what it\u2019s doing. It\u2019s not their job to be reasonable and cultivate favor with Republican leaders,\u201d Stokes said.\n\nThe climate pessimism and optimism of Sunrise\n\nA number of Sunrise members talk about the concept of \u201cmillennial dread\u201d or \u201cmillennial nihilism,\u201d the sense that things are bad and won\u2019t get better for younger generations. That encompasses a lot of things, like student loan debt and the inability to save enough to buy a home, but the climate crisis is a huge part of it.\n\nJoanna Zhu, one of the DC house activists, tells me about a dark joke circulating among her friends: \u201cI don\u2019t have a 401(k). I\u2019m just counting on the apocalypse taking me out sometime soon.\u201d\n\nAnd so, at its essence, Sunrise is a group of scared young people looking for a way to do something. While they\u2019ve speedily become savvy, they are kids \u2014 not seasoned activists.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say a lot of our members are showing up for the first time,\u201d Weber, the Sunrise political director, told me. \u201cThey\u2019re young adults that are just kind of freaked out about the climate crisis and political moment we\u2019re in.\u201d Sunrise\u2019s name alludes to that feeling, that the night is always darkest before the dawn of a new day. The youth are scared, but they\u2019re also hopeful.\n\nAlmost every Sunrise member of the DC house has a story about how climate dramatically made a mark on their lives.\n\nMaunus grew up in Palm City, Florida, which had back-to-back Category 3 and 4 hurricanes when she was in the fourth grade. After one of the storms hit, she and her sister took inner tubes and floated down their street like it was a waterpark. They were the lucky ones; their house was still standing, she told me.\n\nFor Christian Galo from Houston, it was another hurricane. Hurricane Mitch slammed into his family\u2019s home country of Honduras in 1998 as a Category 5 storm, killing more than 7,000 people and displacing thousands more.\n\n\u201cMost of my mom\u2019s family ended up moving outside of Honduras as refugees after,\u201d Galo told me. \u201cJust thinking how vulnerable those populations are now, it feels more urgent now with the migrant crisis.\u201d In 2017, he was afraid for his family again as they took shelter from Hurricane Harvey, when the storm dumped more than four feet of rain on Houston.\n\nGabbi Pierce remembers the earthquakes that started in her hometown of Wichita, Kansas, after oil and gas companies started fracking there. (Wichita is home base for Koch Industries.)\n\n\u201cKansas had never had earthquakes, but around the time I was 14-15, that was the time I felt my first earthquake in Kansas,\u201d she said. A few years later, when she moved to California, she witnessed the wildfires near Los Angeles and the clouds of smoke rolling over the mountains.\n\n\u201cI could smell the smoke in the air, everyone was walking past wearing masks,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cDimming out the sun, it was apocalyptic.\u201d\n\nIt was Galo who summed up why they were all in DC, working with Sunrise: \u201cI would not know how to live with myself if I were not involved.\u201d\n\nElla Nilsen covers the 2020 election and Congress for Vox.
