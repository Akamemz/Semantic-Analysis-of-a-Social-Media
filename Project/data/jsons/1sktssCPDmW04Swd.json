He sought to transform America and that forced him to be a disrupter \u2014 and to bear the wounds of being unpopular in a just cause .\nWith segregation the law of the land and voting rights suppressed , Dr. King understood the only way change would come would be by disrupting an unjust system . He believed in nonviolence , but not in passivity . One of my favorite quotes of Dr. King was when he was asked what his favorite demonstration was . \u201c This week \u2019 s , \u201d he responded , even as he planned for the next week \u2019 s demonstrations .\nColumnists In-depth political coverage , sports analysis , entertainment reviews and cultural commentary .\nDr. King opposed those who equated quiet with peace . We were told to be quiet at the back of the bus , quiet in the face of oppression . He understood that true peace came only with justice , and justice could not be achieved without disruption .\nHe was not an idle dreamer ; he was clear about wanting to amass power . He emphasized the drive for the Voting Rights Act , to protect the power of the vote , because that would give African Americans the power to change their conditions .\nConsider the 2016 election , where Donald Trump lost the popular vote nationally , but won the electoral college by the margin of less than 80,000 votes in three key states \u2014 Michigan , Wisconsin and Pennsylvania . In Michigan , 10,704 ; 22,177 in Wisconsin ; 46,765 in Pennsylvania .\nIn each state , eligible African American voters could have changed the election if they had turned out to vote . In 2020 , Dr. King would be leading efforts to register new voters in numbers larger than those margins as a measure of their power . There are more 18-year-old voters than 81-year-old voters . If they register and vote , they can change the course of history .\nDr. King was fearless in the cause of justice . He realized early that the war in Vietnam was an unjust folly that would not be won . The cost of that war was draining the funds from the war on poverty at home . He came out publicly against the war in a dramatic speech at Riverside Church , publicly criticizing the Democratic president , Lyndon Johnson , with whom he had worked to achieve the end of segregation and the Voting Rights Bill .\nHe was savaged by the establishment media , criticized by leading liberals . Black leaders spoke out against him . At the height of the controversy , he was seen unfavorably by three-fourths of whites , and as \u201c irrelevant \u201d by a majority of blacks . The FBI intensified its covert operations against him , deeming him a national security threat . He was deluged with threats of assassination .\nHe knew he would spark a fierce reaction but realized that he had no choice but to speak . The Vietnam debacle would divide the country and eliminate any hope of rebuilding at home .\nDr. King , of course , was proved right . He was right about the injustice of segregation and of efforts to suppress voting rights . He was right about the need for economic justice in the United States , for basic economic rights that would extend to people of all races . He was right about the need for a war on poverty rather than war abroad . And he was right that the Vietnam War was a costly , unjust debacle that could never be won . Many more knew that he was right , but too few had the courage of their convictions , the courage to speak out , the commitment to action to make things better .\nLet us not censor Dr. King \u2019 s life even as we glorify him . What made him remarkable wasn \u2019 t his dream , but his willingness to sacrifice , to act , to work to make that dream real . Those who would seek to emulate Dr. King would be well advised to launch voter registration and get out the vote drives . Use the power that he helped provide to build even more power , and more justice .",
