    "content": "Iran and six world powers led by the United States have reached a historic agreement , a victory of diplomacy over war that verifiably limits Iran \u2019 s nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions .\nHailed by negotiators as striking a \u201c win-win \u201d balance , amid significant compromises by both sides , the complex and detailed agreement \u2013 running to 159 pages , with annexes \u2013 caps a 13-year dispute over Iran \u2019 s nuclear program that resulted in more than three years of talks , including the last 20 months of intensive negotiations in Switzerland and Austria .\nThe final \u2013 sometimes angry and emotional \u2013 18-day push in the Austrian capital , Vienna , blew through four self-imposed deadlines before a deal was reached early Tuesday .\nAmerican officials say the agreement effectively cuts off four possible pathways to a nuclear weapon for more than a decade by strictly limiting Iran \u2019 s uranium enrichment capacity , stockpiles of nuclear material , and use of facilities , and by adding far more intrusive inspections .\nIranian officials say the deal will prove that Iran has no desire for nuclear weapons , and that it can pave the way for cooperation on other issues afflicting the Middle East .\n\u201c Today could have been the end of hope on this issue , but now we are starting a new chapter of hope , and let \u2019 s build on that , \u201d said Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif . He said the deal was \u201c not perfect for anybody , \u201d but could \u201c open new horizons for dealing with [ other ] serious problems . \u201d\nThe deal is a \u201c new chapter \u201d and shows that diplomacy can \u201c overcome decades of tensions and confrontations , \u201d said Federica Mogherini , the European foreign policy chief who has led the talks on behalf of the so-called P5+1 group \u2013 the five permanent members of the UN Security Council ( the US , Russia , China , Britain , and France ) and Germany .\n`` With courage , political will and mutual respect , we delivered what the world was hoping for , '' said Ms. Mogherini . `` A shared commitment to peace , and to join hands in order to make our world safer . ''\nThe deal , which follows a diplomatic process often overshadowed by the risk of war , is bound to have a profound effect on Iran , and raises the question of how the Islamic Republic \u2019 s regional role might change , if at all .\nWill the Islamic Republic be empowered by a $ 100 billion post-sanctions windfall , as some of its rivals have warned , to exert more influence in the region via proxy armed forces that threaten Israel , Saudi Arabia , or other US allies ?\nOr will Iran \u2013 which faces regional challenges such as the Islamic State ( IS ) jihadists , sectarian strife , and the conflicts engulfing Syria , Iraq , and Yemen \u2013 look for areas of overlapping interests with the US and focus instead on its crippled economy ?\nThe short answer , say analysts who know Iran , is the pocketbook : Tehran \u2019 s top priority will be resuscitating the economy as sanctions ease to improve the daily lives of 80 million Iranians and ensure stability at home . That issue helped elect President Hassan Rouhani in 2013 .\n\u201c The mood is really for renewal rather than expansion , and to revive the economy and to keep the country going , \u201d says Shahram Chubin , an Iran analyst with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Geneva .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think [ the nuclear deal ] will empower them to think that now they can run riot in the region at all , \u201d he says . \u201c After all the neglect that happened these last few years , they really have a lot of catching up to do , for the quality of life for their own people . \u201d\nFor decades , Iran has opposed the US-dominated regional order and challenged Israel and US allies in the Gulf like Saudi Arabia , notes Mr. Chubin .\n\u201c Now \u2026 the \u2018 regional order \u2019 has collapsed ; nobody \u2019 s in charge of it , \u201d and in some places like Iraq and Afghanistan , the interests of Iran and America overlap for the first time , he says . The result is the nuclear deal isn \u2019 t the end , rather \u201c it \u2019 s the beginning of a process . \u201d\nIndeed , both President Barack Obama and Iran \u2019 s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , have hinted that a successful nuclear deal could be the basis of future negotiations .\nMoreover , resolving the once-intractable nuclear issue is an example of what may be possible , say Iran analysts , with other hard-to-crack problems like Syria , where Iran \u2019 s policies and interventions are diametrically opposed to Western ones .\nSo what are the key factors likely to shape Iran \u2019 s post-deal actions , at home and abroad ?\nDespite warnings from some US and Israeli politicians that Iran would use the freed-up revenues from the deal to spread \u201c regional mischief , \u201d the talk inside Iran focuses on easing economic pain .\n\u201c Those who say sanctions are not important don \u2019 t know what is happening in people \u2019 s pockets , \u201d Mr. Rouhani said at a provincial rally in late June . He promised that with the deal \u201c we will enrich both uranium and the economy . \u201d\nSince Iran \u2019 s oil industry \u2013 the country \u2019 s main source of foreign currency \u2013 is still state-owned and revenue flows through the central bank , the Rouhani administration \u201c will get first dibs , and they have [ domestic ] priorities right now , \u201d says Kevan Harris , of the Center for Iran and Persian Gulf Studies at Princeton University .\nIranians have been stung by soaring inflation in recent years , raising the cost of everything from tomatoes to medicine . So Iranian politicians have been talking up the economic benefit of sanctions removal , from foreign investments to more employment .\nIn April , lawmaker Ahmad Tavakkoli said Iran \u2019 s human resources , diverse climate , and geopolitical situation \u201c have not been effectively used , \u201d and that \u201c concentrating on foreign issues would waste such opportunities and keep us away from reality . \u201d\nEstimates of Iran \u2019 s spending needs are vast , according to data compiled by Bijan Khajehpour , head of the Vienna-based arm of the Iran analytical firm , Atieh International . Rouhani \u2019 s top priority is the \u201c empowerment of domestic industry , \u201d including for export , and creating more value in the energy sector \u2013 all of which make jobs , he said in a presentation June 29 .\nBut the initial pricetag will be $ 122 billion , with the banking sector alone requiring $ 25 billion to partly settle the previous government \u2019 s debts , estimates Mr. Khajehpour . Construction contracts , with their multiplier effects on jobs and the economy , will require a minimum of $ 30 billion , and the petroleum industry will need an interim $ 40 billion \u2013 just over half of the $ 70 billion necessary to bring oil production levels back to 2012 levels . Another $ 7 billion will be required for infrastructure projects from the Internet to telecoms .\nLifting sanctions will \u201c be surely felt in people \u2019 s lives long-term , \u201d said MP Abouzar Nadimi , deputy chair of parliament \u2019 s Economic Commission , in April . The nuclear deal will lead industry \u201c to fulfill its full capacity . ''\nThe nuclear deal was achieved even as the Middle East lurches into its most volatile period in decades .\nWhile some Iranian officials hold fast to the rhetoric of \u201c resistance \u201d against US and Israeli influence \u2013 claiming that the ideals of Iran \u2019 s 1979 Islamic revolution are spreading \u2013 others recognize that Iran and the US are on the same side when it comes to fighting Sunni militants .\nBut will this deal enable a more antagonistic Iranian posture ? Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2013 who tried to block it \u2013 said in March that Iran was \u201c gobbling up four countries right now , \u201d and would control more if sanctions were lifted .\nAnd Martin Indyk , a former senior US official now at the Brookings Institution , testified to the Senate in early June that a new regional security network must \u201c contain and roll-back Iran \u2019 s nefarious hegemonic ambitions . \u201d\nBut as painful as they have been for Iran \u2019 s economy , the sanctions have hardly been a deterrent to its military endeavors : Iran has still rearmed Lebanese Hezbollah with tens of thousands of rockets for any future battle with Israel ; spent billions of dollars a year backing Syria \u2019 s President Bashar al-Assad in a war that has taken more than 220,000 lives ; and resurrected Shiite militias in Iraq to fight IS \u2013 ironically in concert with US airstrikes .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think the release of funds , which after all is going to be very gradual , is going to change the pace or intensity of any of [ Iran \u2019 s ] significant involvements , \u201d says Richard Dalton , a former British ambassador to Iran now at the Chatham House think tank in London .\n\u201c It \u2019 s all very opaque , so we don \u2019 t know whether there \u2019 s updating of a Hezbollah capability , or they have a wish list from Assad that they \u2019 ve been gagging to respond to and haven \u2019 t been able to , \u201d he says . \u201c There could be . But ... these will be incremental . \u201d\nFrom Beirut to Kabul , Iran \u2019 s model now is defensive , says Carnegie \u2019 s Chubin . Syria , especially , has been costly in cash and dead Iranian generals , and also has tarnished Hezbollah . \u201c Iran is not madcap about doing more , \u201d he says .\nThe narrative that Iran will \u201c plow its hard-won sanctions relief into regional adventurism \u2026 is powerful , compelling , and frightening . It is also not true , \u201d wrote Richard Nephew , a former director for Iran at the US National Security Council and former member of the US nuclear negotiating team , in a mid-June column for Reuters .\nSuch analysis defies history , he argued , because when Iran had $ 100 billion in restricted oil funds just over two years ago , it \u201c was not plowing it all into Assad , the Houthis [ in Yemen ] or troublemaking along the Gulf. \u201d When Iran was making $ 88 billion a year from high oil prices in 2012 , he wrote , \u201c no one alleges that all of that money was going to terrorists . \u201d\nWith the nuclear deal done , the European Council on Foreign Relations is proposing engagement with Iran .
