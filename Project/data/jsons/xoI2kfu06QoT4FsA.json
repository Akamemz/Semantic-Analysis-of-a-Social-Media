The troubles of the news business are a major PR problem for these companies , who \u2014 however fair they or anyone else thinks it is \u2014 get blamed for its ills . The right way to understand the actions they take is by asking how they do or don \u2019 t address that problem .\nAnd from that perspective , those headlines are the real wins .\nThe next time one of their executives gets dragged to D.C. , he can go beyond platitudes about democracy and trying to explain the value of traffic to congressmen who can \u2019 t figure out their smartphones . He can say : \u201c Actually , we do pay news publishers for their work \u2014 many millions of dollars every year. \u201d It \u2019 s a good line !\nThink about it . Both Google and Facebook have a lot of news in their products \u2014 in search , in the News Feed . But they have a lot more stuff that isn \u2019 t news . And they make a much , much , much larger share of their money from all that other stuff .\nSearches for \u201c city council meeting last night \u201d and \u201c what \u2019 s happening in syria \u201d are much less common \u2014 and much less remunerative \u2014 than searches for \u201c best compact suv \u201d and \u201c cure for balding. \u201d Google , pushing back against Australia \u2019 s attempt to force it to hand over cash to news companies , said \u201c news-related queries accounted for just over 1 percent of total queries on Google Search in Australia. \u201d Even if you think Google is defining \u201c news-related queries \u201d too narrowly , it \u2019 s not a big number .\nMeanwhile , when Facebook cut back on how much news hits the News Feed in January 2018 , they reduced it from a whopping 5 percent of total content\u2026to 4 percent .\nFrom the duopoly \u2019 s perspective , the biggest problem with paying for all the news coursing through their digital veins isn \u2019 t the money . ( They have plenty of money . ) It \u2019 s that paying for news in any systemic way would attack their core advantage as platforms : organizing other people \u2019 s content .\nSay you think Google owes The New York Times money for including all of its news stories in search . Fine . Do they also owe me money for including my old blog from the early 2000s ? It \u2019 s in Google \u2019 s index too . How about Breitbart ? How about The Daily Stormer or Stormfront ? What about your tweets ? DairyQueen.com ? All of them are digital content that contribute some sort of notional value to Google as a product . Maybe you think you can draw the line somewhere , but where \u2014 and how do you apply it to an index of billions of websites ?\nShould Facebook pay publishers based on how much value they add to News Feed ? Okay \u2014 then the biggest check goes to the Daily Mail , and The Daily Wire gets as much as The New York Times .\nNo , any sort of systematic , performance-driven payments to publishers based on the value they offer platforms are a no-go . So Facebook and Google have responded by looking for other ways to deal with the PR headache by getting money to news companies .\nThe first wave was all about giving grants . Google started the Digital News Initiative in 2015 to fund innovation projects at European publishers \u2014 or , more accurately , to stave off regulation by European countries . That eventually spread to other parts of the world where legislators were making angry noises in Google \u2019 s general direction . Facebook , playing PR catch-up after Donald Trump \u2019 s election , answered with its own Facebook Journalism Project in January 2017 .\nBoth of these projects have given many millions of dollars to news publishers around the world . The people who work on them earnestly support the cause of journalism and want to help . But they \u2019 ve also done very little to meaningfully change the news industry \u2019 s core financial crisis . Publishers \u2019 problems are not , generally speaking , the kind of thing that can be fixed with one-time grants for innovation projects . The core crisis is that the internet fundamentally changed the ways audiences and advertisers get things done \u2014 in ways that hurt expensive-to-produce journalism and helped a few globe-bestriding tech giants like Google and Facebook .\nSo last year began the second wave \u2014 and this time it was Facebook who took the lead . It started making deals with individual publishers for their stories to appear in a brand new Facebook News Tab , to be curated by Facebook editors . Some news outlets would reportedly get as much as $ 3 million a year .\nThis is so much better from Facebook \u2019 s perspective , for two big reasons . First , it can pick whatever publishers it wants to give money to . ( Facebook is paying some of the publications in the News Tab , but only some \u2014 most get zip . ) And second , it \u2019 s money for a new tab buried so deep in Facebook \u2019 s interface you need a spelunker \u2019 s headlamp to find it \u2014 not for the part of Facebook that people use and publishers feel abused by , News Feed .\nFrom a legal perspective , it \u2019 s entirely unclear why Facebook is paying any of these publishers . Open up your Facebook News Tab , if you can find it , and tap on a story \u2014 it \u2019 s just a link to the publication \u2019 s website , opening in a browser . ( Or in an Instant Article , if a publisher is already using it . ) You don \u2019 t need to pay a site to link to one of its news stories ; after all , Facebook isn \u2019 t paying most of the publishers in the News Tab , and it doesn \u2019 t pay publishers for any of the links in News Feed .\nSo why is Facebook doing it ? Because this lets them ( 1 ) pick the publishers they want to pay , ( 2 ) pick the amount of money they want to pay them , ( 3 ) get publishers to stop complaining , at least hopefully , and ( 4 ) get headlines like \u201c Facebook Offers News Outlets Millions of Dollars a Year , \u201d in the hopes that they can stave off government regulation or taxation .\nFacebook \u2019 s not spending who-knows-how-many millions of dollars a year because they think News Tab will be profitable to the bottom line . It \u2019 s a way to solve a PR and policy problem . Mark Zuckerberg even helpfully urged other tech companies to follow his lead .\nAnd now we have Google moving in the same direction . From Ben Mullin \u2019 s Wall Street Journal story :\nAlphabet Inc. \u2019 s Google said it has reached agreements with selected publishers around the world to license news content , a significant development in the yearslong tug of war between the tech giant and media companies . Google said the initial participants include Germany \u2019 s Spiegel Group , publisher of Der Spiegel ; Brazilian media company Diarios Associados ; and Solstice Media , the publisher of local newspapers in Australia . [ \u2026 ] [ Google VP Brad Bender ] declined to provide financial details on the latest licensing deals , saying they vary depending on how much and what type of content each publisher is providing to Google . Google is paying the news organizations to license audio , video , images and stories that will be featured on Google \u2019 s primary mobile app and on mobile devices using the Android operating system , accessible with a swipe on the homescreen . The licensed content will also be built into the Google News app for every mobile device , and the company hopes to eventually make it available on other Google products . Google aims to launch the product later this year , Mr. Bender said .\nNote the similarities with Facebook \u2019 s News Tab . Google picks what publishers it wants to deal with and how much to offer them . It \u2019 s for a Google side product , not the big kahuna of search .\nAnd , as with News Tab , it \u2019 s not even clear that Google has to pay for the content . Google already has a Google News app , after all , and it \u2019 s already full of links to news stories that open in a browser . Google doesn \u2019 t pay the publishers who produce all those stories , and they \u2019 re not about to start paying them . They \u2019 ll pick and choose .\n( Presumably Google will be able to build these newly licensed stories more directly into the app , probably via AMP , rather than have them open in a browser . But that \u2019 s a technical detail . )\nGoogle also already has a stream of news for \u201c mobile devices using the Android operating system , accessible with a swipe on the homescreen. \u201d It debuted way back in 2012 as Google Now , then became Google Feed , and is now Google Discover . It already features lots of news stories for which Google pays zero dollars .\nAnd come on , look at where Google is doing these deals . Germany , which has been trying to get Google to pay for a decade and is trying again . And Australia , which recently announced a \u201c mandatory code of conduct \u201d that would force Google to pay for Australian news . And Brazil , which has its own history here .\nIf I were a publisher and Google and Facebook wanted to write me a check to do nothing other than keep publishing , I \u2019 d be very happy to cash it . But this second wave of plans is \u2014 just like the first wave was \u2014 more about solving the company \u2019 s problems than anyone else \u2019 s .",
