He said the U.S. appears to be `` turning its back on us . ''\n`` So as soon as you have a member who feels they have a right to head off on their own , granted by the United States of America , they do it , '' Macron said , referring to Turkey 's military offensive into Syria following the troop withdrawal . `` And that 's what happened .
