    "content": "As the father to sons who are 25 and 17 years old , I love millennials and Generation Z . But it 's getting harder and harder to feel sympathy for kids born between 1981 and 2012 ( give or take ) .\nIt 's not all\u2014or maybe even mostly\u2014their fault . Much of the problem stems from the ways in which the media covers the plight of younger Americans , especially the supposedly catastrophic amount of student loan debt they have taken on simply to get a college degree which is now , we 're told , a nearly meaningless piece of paper that no longer `` automatically '' guarantees admission to the `` middle class . '' A recent story in The Wall Street Journal exemplifies this approach . It 's titled `` Playing Catch-Up in the Game of Life : Millennials Approach Middle Age in Crisis '' and promises `` New data show they 're in worse financial shape than every preceding living generation and may never recover . '' Mostly , it highlights individuals and couples who have tons of student debt and , as a result , supposedly ca n't buy houses , have kids , or even get married .\nIn fact , it 's far from clear that crude economics is driving , say , the reduction in fertility rates , which have been dropping for decades everywhere in the world and are tied to increases in female autonomy . And for all the talk about generational poverty , it 's not immediately clear that all is darkness . According to a Pew study in 2018 , millennial households now `` match the highest household income for their age group . '' Throw in higher rates of advanced education , and the future actually looks promising . And it appears that millennials may be better off in various ways than Gen X was at the same stage of life .\nIn any case , there is so much wrong with the narrative about student loan debt that it 's hard to know where to start . In the first place , more people , including more low-income people , are going to college than ever before and college grads have much higher lifetime earnings and much lower unemployment rates than folks with just a high school diploma , an associate 's degree , or a few years of college . As the economist Scott Winship has written , `` If we 're counting rising student indebtedness on the debt side of the ledger , should n't we count the value of the asset financed by the debt ( human capital ) on the asset side ? '' And despite the aggregate $ 1.5 trillion out there in student debt , the average and median amounts owed by individuals students are hardly breathtaking .\nAccording to data from Lending Tree , for instance , about 70 percent of the class of 2018 took out loans ; their median monthly payment was $ 222 . The average loan amount ( which will be higher than the median ) for graduates with debt was about $ 30,000 . According to Pew :\nThe median borrower with outstanding student loan debt for his or her own education owed $ 17,000 in 2016 . The amount owed varies considerably , however . A quarter of borrowers with outstanding debt reported owing $ 7,000 or less , while another quarter owed $ 43,000 or more .\nSo most borrowers are actually acting responsibly . College grads make about 80 percent more than high school grads , so taking on debt is n't stupid . And even though college has been getting more expensive , the wage premium remains high enough that the number of years needed to recoup the price of college has n't increased for decades , according to work done by the New York Federal Reserve :\nIt 's extremely difficult to get straight answers about many aspects of education-related debt . Often , it 's not clear if the debt for a given year includes loans for grad school , including law school or medical school , which are not just much more expensive but also much more remunerative and optional . Ninety percent of law school grads borrow , for instance , and the average debt load is $ 127,000 for people attending private schools and $ 88,000 for those going to state schools . Three-quarters of med students take out loans that average around $ 200,000 , but the typical doctor makes between $ 150,000 and $ 312,000 per year , so the debt is n't particularly tough to pay back . Should we feel bad for lawyers and doctors ?\nIt 's obviously preferable to graduate from college with little or no debt . But media accounts inevitably gravitate to people with eye-popping amounts of debt that are nobody 's fault but their own . Worse still , the reports rarely include any sort of detailed information that would allow a reader to get a better sense of the individual 's life choices . Yes , relatively cheap loans doubtlessly entice some people to go to college who would n't if they had to pay higher interest rates ( if student loans were dischargeable in bankruptcy proceedings , interest rates\u2014even those offered by the federal government , which disburses about 90 percent of student loan dollars\u2014would be much higher ) . But ultimately the borrower has to take responsibility for his or her actions . I say that as someone who paid his way through undergraduate and graduate school and sweated blood every time I signed for a student loan . Youth is a time of great folly , yes , but you know exactly how much you 're going to be paying back for exactly how long .\nIn The Wall Street Journal story , we meet a 32-year-old woman living in Chicago who `` is a renter who is single and earns $ 75,000 a year [ working for the city ] . She also owes $ 102,000 in student loans and $ 10,000 in credit-card debt . '' Her salary is actually kind of great , especially for someone her age . The median household income for Chicago is about $ 53,000 and the median per capita income there is $ 33,000 . She 's got three times the average student debt , but we have no way of knowing where she went to college or whether there 's a grad degree tucked into that .\nMaking $ 75,000 a year breaks down to $ 6,250 a month . Assume she 's paying 33 percent in total taxes , that brings her monthly take-home pay to about $ 4,200 . Assuming she 's paying 7 percent on her loans , she 's on the hook for about $ 1,200 a month , leaving $ 3,000 to cover rent , food , and everything else . That 's not great , but it 's doable . In real dollars , it 's about $ 20,000 more than I was bringing home in the mid-'90s when I started at \u2588\u2588\u2588 and lived in Los Angeles with a non-working spouse and 1-year-old son . Does she have roommates ? Why did she spend so much on college ? Reading this story made me think of last year 's Time cover story on teachers who supposedly had to work two or three extra jobs because they 're `` not paid for the work [ they ] do . '' So much of household finance is tied to spending levels , which are never really discussed .\nWe also meet a thirty-something couple that `` run a financial-advice website , whittling away at their combined student debt of $ 377,000 . '' What ? One of them is a lawyer , so let 's assume that as much as $ 127,000 of the debt went toward a private school law degree . There 's still a quarter of a million dollars in student debt to account for . The story does n't provide any extenuating circumstances and , to be honest , I ca n't imagine any that would explain such as situation other than really dumb choices . Should we as a society be ready to forgive such mistakes via universal debt relief programs proposed by politicians such as Sens . Elizabeth Warren ( D\u2013Mass . ) and Bernie Sanders ( I\u2013Vt. ) ? That seems like an insult and an outrage to everybody , parent and student alike , who scrimped and saved and went to schools they could afford .\nIn an Associated Press story about Robert F. Smith , the billionaire who just announced he would pay off all the student debt of Morehouse College 's class of 2019 , we meet a 22-year-old finance major with an inexplicably and shockingly high amount of student debt\u2014 $ 200,000 , an amount that would take him 25 years to pay off `` at half his monthly salary , per his calculations . '' When Smith made his pledge during Morehouse 's commencement , the student wept .\n`` I do n't have to live off of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches . I was shocked . My heart dropped . We all cried . In the moment it was like a burden had been taken off . ''\nSurely I 'm not the only one who 's wondering how the hell someone\u2014a finance major , of all people\u2014ended up $ 200,000 in hock by graduation . The full list price for Morehouse is almost $ 50,000 a year , but the average net price is $ 32,000 after grants and scholarships are factored in . Even if he put all four years on loans , that should be $ 128,000 , not $ 200,000 . More to the point , who would do such a thing ? The average net price of nearby Georgia State is $ 15,000 . Borrowing $ 200,000 for a bachelor 's degree is simply inexplicable .\nI 've written often about how younger Americans are indeed being screwed by my own generation , the baby boomers . Old-age entitlements are a brutal form of generational warfare that systematically rob from the relatively young and poor in order to give to the objectively old and rich . The 2008 financial crisis has further beggared the young , who have also grown up in a century with lower-than-average economic growth ( thank you , persistent deficit spending and massive national debt ) .\nOlder people in America have a lot of explaining to do , and we need to reform all sorts of policies that slow economic growth and direct all sorts of unearned wealth to people who do n't need it . But younger Americans\u2014at least those who manage to royally screw up their finances by graduation day\u2014also need to be held accountable .",
