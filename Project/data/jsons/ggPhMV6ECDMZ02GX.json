    "content": "Have you ever heard of a condition known as \u201c general paresis of the insane \u201d ? Probably not . In the 19th century general paresis was one of the most commonly diagnosed mental disorders . Its symptoms included odd social behaviors , impaired judgment , depressed mood and difficulty concentrating . Around the turn of the 20th century , though , we figured what it really was\u2014a form of late-stage syphilis infecting the brain and disrupting its function . A few decades later we discovered a highly effective treatment : penicillin .\nAlthough general paresis is now very rare , its example is still instructive . Any honest researcher will tell you we don \u2019 t currently have good explanations for most mental disorders . Depression , obsessive-compulsive disorder , schizophrenia\u2014we don \u2019 t really know how these patterns of disrupted thought , behavior and emotion develop or why they stick around .\nYet the hope remains that , much like with general paresis , we may soon discover the root causes of these illnesses , and this knowledge may tell us how to treat them . An example of this hope can be seen in the popular notion that a \u201c chemical imbalance \u201d causes depression . This might turn out to be true , but the truth is we don \u2019 t know .\nSome researchers are starting to think that for many mental disorders , such hope might be based on incorrect assumptions . Instead of having one root cause , as general paresis did , mental disorders might be caused by many mechanisms acting together . These mechanisms might be situated in the brain , but they could also be located in the body and even in the external environment , interacting with one another in a network to create the patterns of distress and dysfunction we currently recognize and label as varieties of mental illness . In this more complex view , patterns such as depression and generalized anxiety arise as tendencies in the human brain-body-environment system .
