Russia retaliated after the law was passed in 2012 by suspending Americans ' ability to adopt Russian children .\nAt least five congressional staffers and State Department officials attended that movie showing , according to a Foreign Agent Registration Act complaint filed with the Justice Department about Veselnitskaya \u2019 s efforts .\nAnd Veselnitskaya also attended a dinner with the chairman of the House subcommittee overseeing Russia policy , Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ( R-Calif. ) and roughly 20 other guests at a dinner club frequented by Republicans .\nIn an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Wednesday , Rohrabacher said , \u201c There was a dinner at the Capitol Hill Club here with about 20 people . I think I was the only congressman there . They were talking about the Magnitsky case . But that wasn \u2019 t just the topic . There was a lot of other things going on . So I think she was there , but I don \u2019 t remember any type of conversation with her between us . But I understand she was at the table . \u201d\nRohrabacher said he believed Veselnitskaya and her U.S. colleagues , which included former Rep. Ronald Dellums ( D-Calif. ) , were lobbying other lawmakers to reverse the Magnitsky Act and restore the ability of Americans to adopt Russian children that Moscow had suspended .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think this was very heavily lobbied at all compared with the other issues we deal with , \u201d he said .\nAs for his former congressional colleague Dellums , Rohrabacher said he recalled having a conversation about the Magnitsky Act and the adoption issue : \u201c Ron and I like each other \u2026 I have to believe he was a hired lobbyist but I don \u2019 t know . ''\nVeselnitskaya did not return a call seeking comment Wednesday at her Moscow office . Dellums also did not return a call to his office seeking comment .\nBut in an interview with NBC News earlier this week , Veselnitskaya acknowledged her contacts with Trump Jr. and in Washington were part of a lobbying campaign to get members of Congress and American political figures to see `` the real circumstances behind the Magnitsky Act . \u201d\nThat work was a far cry from the narrow reason the U.S. government initially gave for allowing Veselnitskaya into the U.S. in late 2015 , according to federal court records .\nThe Moscow lawyer had been turned down for a visa to enter the U.S. lawfully but then was granted special immigration parole by then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch for the limited purpose of helping a company owned by Russian businessman Denis Katsyv , her client , defend itself against a Justice Department asset forfeiture case in federal court in New York City .\nDuring a court hearing in early January 2016 , as Veselnitskaya \u2019 s permission to stay in the country was about to expire , federal prosecutors described how rare the grant of parole immigration was as Veselnitskaya pleaded for more time to remain in the United States .\n\u201c In October the government bypassed the normal visa process and gave a type of extraordinary permission to enter the country called immigration parole , \u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Monteleoni explained to the judge during a hearing on Jan. 6 , 2016 .\n\u201c That 's a discretionary act that the statute allows the attorney general to do in extraordinary circumstances . In this case , we did that so that Mr. Katsyv could testify . And we made the further accommodation of allowing his Russian lawyer into the country to assist , \u201d he added .\nThe prosecutor said the Justice Department was willing to allow the Russian lawyer to enter the United States again as the trial in the case approached so she could help prepare and attend the proceedings .\nThe court record indicates the presiding judge asked the Justice Department to extend Veselnitskaya \u2019 s immigration parole another week until he decided motions in the case . There are no other records in the court file indicating what happened with that request or how Veselnitskaya appeared in the country later that spring .\nThe U.S. Attorney \u2019 s office in New York confirmed Wednesday to \u2588\u2588\u2588 that it let Veselnitskaya into the country on a grant of immigration parole from October 2015 to early January 2016 .\nJustice Department and State Department officials could not immediately explain how the Russian lawyer was still in the country in June for the meeting with Trump Jr. and the events in Washington .\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley Charles ( Chuck ) Ernest GrassleySpeaker Pelosi , it 's time to throw American innovators a lifeline Barr : Inspector general 's report on alleged FISA abuses 'imminent ' Pelosi aide hopeful White House will support drug-pricing bill despite criticism MORE ( R-Iowa ) has demanded the U.S. government provide him all records on how Veselnitskaya entered and traveled in the U.S. , a request that could shed additional light on her activities .\nInterviews with a half dozen Americans who came in contact with Veselnitskaya or monitored her U.S. activities in 2016 make clear that one of her primary goals was to see if the Congress and/or other political leaders would be interested in repealing the 2012 Magnitsky Act punishing Russia or at least ensure the Magnitsky name would not be used on a new law working its way through Congress in 2016 to punish human rights violators across the globe .\n\u201c There \u2019 s zero doubt that she and her U.S. colleagues were lobbying to repeal Magnitsky or at least ensure his name was removed from the global law Congress was considering , \u201d said U.S. businessman William Browder , who was the main proponent for the Magnitsky Act and who filed a FARA complaint against Veselnitskaya , Dellums and other U.S. officials , claiming they should have registered as foreign agent lobbyists because of the work .\nThe 2012 law punished Russia for the prison death of Sergei Magnitsky , a Moscow lawyer and accountant who U.S. authorities allege uncovered a massive $ 230 million money laundering scheme involving Russian government officials that hurt U.S. companies .\nMagnitsky became a cause celeb in the United States after his mysterious death in a Russian prison , but Russian officials have disputed his version of events and in 2011 posthumously convicted him of fraud in Russia .\nIt is that alternate theory of the Magnitsky fraud cause that Veselnitskaya and her U.S. allies tried to get into the hands of American officials , including Rohrabacher , the Trump team and other leaders .\nBrowder 's complaint , which alleges that Washington lobbyists working with Veselnitskaya failed to register as foreign agents , is still pending at the Justice Department .
