    "content": "A batch of newly released documents , including court filings as well as notes from interviews conducted by Rudy Giuliani , have put the spotlight back on Biden family dealings in Ukraine\u2014even as House Democrats ' impeachment probe zeroes in on President Trump \u2019 s push to convince Kiev to investigate them .\nAnd they 've raised more questions about how much money Joe Biden 's son Hunter made while serving on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas firm at the center of the controversy , with one estimate putting the figure in the `` millions . ''\nAmong the documents , as Fox News reported Wednesday , are notes from an interview Trump attorney Giuliani conducted with fired Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin earlier this year , in which he claimed he was told by former U.S . Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey R. Pyatt to back off an investigation involving that firm , Burisma Holdings , and its founder . According to interview notes , Shokin claimed Pyatt -- currently the ambassador to Greece -- told him to handle that investigation \u201c with white gloves . \u201d\nEX-UKRAINIAN PROSECUTOR SAID HE WAS TOLD TO BACK OFF PROBE OF BIDEN-LINKED FIRM , FILES SHOW\nShokin said his \u201c investigations stopped out of fear of the United States . \u201d\nIn that interview , Shokin also claimed that former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko told him he should not investigate Burisma , \u201c as it was not in the interest of Joe and/or Hunter Biden. \u201d Shokin claimed Poroshenko told him that due to his investigation , Joe Biden held \u201c up to one billion dollars in U.S. aid to Ukraine. \u201d Poroshenko eventually removed Shokin .\nBiden 's campaign and congressional Democrats reject these allegations , maintaining that Biden was only involved due to corruption concerns surrounding Shokin and casting Giuliani 's claims as `` debunked conspiracy theories . ''\nThe interview notes , though , align with a European court affidavit from Shokin , which was published by The Hill last week . The affidavit came as part of an Austrian extradition case involving another wealthy Ukrainian businessman , Dmitry Firtash .\nThe sworn affidavit states that Poroshenko asked him to resign \u201c due to pressure from the U.S. Presidential administration , in particular from Joe Biden . \u201d\n\u201c On several occasions , President Poroshenko asked me to have a look at the criminal case against Burisma and consider the possibility of winding down the investigative actions in respect of this company , \u201d he continued . \u201c But I refused to close this investigation . \u201d\nShokin went on to state he was \u201c forced to leave office , under direct and intense pressure from Joe Biden and the US administration . \u201d\n\u201c In my conversations with Poroshenko at the time , he was emphatic that I should cease my investigations regarding Burisma , \u201d he stated . \u201c When I did not , he said that the US ( via Biden ) were refusing to release the USD $ 1 billion promised to Ukraine . He said that he had no choice , therefore , but to ask me to resign . \u201d\nDespite his claims , Shokin , on both sides of the Atlantic , had been widely accused of corruption .\n\u201c His reputation for investigating corruption in Ukraine\u2014whether it had to do with Hunter Biden \u2019 s firm or the broader plague of deep , embedded and systematic corruption in Ukraine\u2014he didn \u2019 t have a shining reputation , \u201d John Hannah , former national security adviser to former Vice President Dick Cheney , told Fox News ' \u201c America \u2019 s Newsroom \u201d Thursday . \u201c He wasn \u2019 t simply opposed by the U.S. administration at that time ... but by the entire trans-Atlantic alliance in Europe . \u201d\nHannah added that if Shokin has \u201c real evidence \u201d that \u201c intense pressure was brought on him to go easy on Hunter Biden , \u201d he should come forward . \u201c But knowing this guy \u2019 s reputation , I \u2019 m a little skeptical of the charges he \u2019 s making at this point in time , but we need to get the facts , obviously , \u201d Hannah said .\nPoroshenko has also told reporters that Biden never asked him to open or close any cases .\nYet Fox News has obtained notes from another interview Giuliani conducted\u2014with Yuriy Lutsenko , the former Ukrainian prosecutor who replaced Shokin and eventually closed the Burisma probe .\nAccording to the notes of the interview , conducted in New York City in January 2019 , Lutsenko said he \u201c believes Mr. Viktor Shokin ... is honest . \u201d\nLutsenko , in the interview notes , did not weigh in on why the investigation into Burisma was closed or Biden \u2019 s involvement -- but did say he \u201c believes Hunter Biden receives millions of dollars in compensation from Burisma . \u201d\nIt is unclear how much money Hunter Biden made while serving on the board of the firm , but reports have estimated he made up to $ 50,000 per month .
