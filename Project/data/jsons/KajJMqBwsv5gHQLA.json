But regulatory delays and pushback from critics\u2014including a Native-American tribe that has performed war dances at the dam\u2014prevented it from happening .\nRaising the dam , which is a fairly common procedure though not on this magnitude , would cost about $ 1.3 billion . Getting the project funded through Congress and other sources , however , would be a challenge .\nThe hurdles in expanding the Shasta Dam underscore a broader problem in the nation \u2019 s most populous state as it grapples with a devastating four-year drought : state and federal officials haven \u2019 t significantly upgraded California \u2019 s water infrastructure in decades .\nBuilding water projects amid divisions among residents in Northern California , where most of the water can be found , and Southern California , where most residents live , is a challenge . There are about 1,400 dams under state and federal control in California and roughly 1,300 reservoirs , officials said .\nSince the last major state or federal dam was completed in 1979 , California \u2019 s population has grown to 39 million people from 23 million .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve added millions of people and yet we \u2019 re operating on a 1960s infrastructure for the entire state , \u201d said Jeffrey Kightlinger , general manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California , which serves 19 million residents .\nThe heyday of large-scale projects to move water to farms and urban areas in California ended during the tenure of Gov . Edmund G. \u201c Pat \u201d Brown in the 1960s , and little has taken place since his son , current Gov . Jerry Brown , first led the state in the 1970s and early 1980s .\nThe Democratic governor championed a $ 7.5 billion bond measure passed by California voters last year that includes $ 2.7 billion for water storage projects .\nMr. Brown has staked his political capital on a $ 15.5 billion plan to build twin , 30-mile-long tunnels beneath the San Joaquin Delta in the center of the state to bypass crumbling levees and an ecologically sensitive area , and move water more reliably to the parched south .\n\u201c The total project is absolutely crucial to maintain our economic strength , not only in Northern California but throughout the whole state , \u201d Mr. Brown said in a recent interview .\nBut that plan has divided farmers , environmentalists and Democratic politicians , and opponents have put a measure on the November 2016 ballot to require approval from California voters .\nA drought-relief bill introduced this summer by Democratic U.S. Sens . Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer would have authorized $ 600 million for dam projects in the Golden State , which could include Shasta . It followed a bill by Rep. David Valadao , a Republican from the agricultural Central Valley , that would help streamline approvals for such projects .
