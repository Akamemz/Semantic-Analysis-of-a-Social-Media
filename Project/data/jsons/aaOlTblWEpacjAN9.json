A personality psychologist at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development , Rohrer is trying to get her peers to publicly , willingly admit it when they are wrong .\nTo do this , she , along with some colleagues , started up something called the Loss of Confidence Project . It \u2019 s designed to be an academic safe space for researchers to declare for all to see that they no longer believe in the accuracy of one of their previous findings . The effort recently yielded a paper that includes six admissions of no confidence . And it \u2019 s accepting submissions until January 31 .\n\u201c I do think it \u2019 s a cultural issue that people are not willing to admit mistakes , \u201d Rohrer says . \u201c Our broader goal is to gently nudge the whole scientific system and psychology toward a different culture , \u201d where it \u2019 s okay , normalized , and expected for researchers to admit past mistakes and not get penalized for it .\nThe project is timely because a large number of scientific findings have been disproven , or become more doubtful , in recent years . One high-profile effort to retest 100 psychological experiments found only 40 percent replicated with more rigorous methods . It \u2019 s been a painful period for social scientists , who \u2019 ve had to deal with failed replications of classic studies and realize their research practices are often weak .\n\u201c Not knowing the scope of your own ignorance is part of the human condition \u201d\nIt \u2019 s been fascinating to watch scientists struggle to make their institutions more humble . And I believe there \u2019 s an important and underappreciated virtue embedded in this process .\nFor the past few months , I \u2019 ve been talking to many scholars about intellectual humility , the characteristic that allows for admission of wrongness .\nI \u2019 ve come to appreciate what a crucial tool it is for learning , especially in an increasingly interconnected and complicated world . As technology makes it easier to lie and spread false information incredibly quickly , we need intellectually humble , curious people .\nI \u2019 ve also realized how difficult it is to foster intellectual humility . In my reporting on this , I \u2019 ve learned there are three main challenges on the path to humility :\nIn order for us to acquire more intellectual humility , we all , even the smartest among us , need to better appreciate our cognitive blind spots . Our minds are more imperfect and imprecise than we \u2019 d often like to admit . Our ignorance can be invisible . Even when we overcome that immense challenge and figure out our errors , we need to remember we won \u2019 t necessarily be punished for saying , \u201c I was wrong. \u201d And we need to be braver about saying it . We need a culture that celebrates those words . We \u2019 ll never achieve perfect intellectual humility . So we need to choose our convictions thoughtfully .\nThis is all to say : Intellectual humility isn \u2019 t easy . But damn , it \u2019 s a virtue worth striving for , and failing for , in this new year .\nIntellectual humility is simply \u201c the recognition that the things you believe in might in fact be wrong , \u201d as Mark Leary , a social and personality psychologist at Duke University , tells me .\nBut don \u2019 t confuse it with overall humility or bashfulness . It \u2019 s not about being a pushover ; it \u2019 s not about lacking confidence , or self-esteem . The intellectually humble don \u2019 t cave every time their thoughts are challenged .\nInstead , it \u2019 s a method of thinking . It \u2019 s about entertaining the possibility that you may be wrong and being open to learning from the experience of others . Intellectual humility is about being actively curious about your blind spots . One illustration is in the ideal of the scientific method , where a scientist actively works against her own hypothesis , attempting to rule out any other alternative explanations for a phenomenon before settling on a conclusion . It \u2019 s about asking : What am I missing here ?\nIt doesn \u2019 t require a high IQ or a particular skill set . It does , however , require making a habit of thinking about your limits , which can be painful . \u201c It \u2019 s a process of monitoring your own confidence , \u201d Leary says .\nWhen I open myself up to the vastness of my own ignorance , I can \u2019 t help but feel a sudden suffocating feeling\nThis idea is older than social psychology . Philosophers from the earliest days have grappled with the limits of human knowledge . Michel de Montaigne , the 16th-century French philosopher credited with inventing the essay , wrote that \u201c the plague of man is boasting of his knowledge . \u201d\nSocial psychologists have learned that humility is associated with other valuable character traits : People who score higher on intellectual humility questionnaires are more open to hearing opposing views . They more readily seek out information that conflicts with their worldview . They pay more attention to evidence and have a stronger self-awareness when they answer a question incorrectly .\nWhen you ask the intellectually arrogant if they \u2019 ve heard of bogus historical events like \u201c Hamrick \u2019 s Rebellion , \u201d they \u2019 ll say , \u201c Sure. \u201d The intellectually humble are less likely to do so . Studies have found that cognitive reflection \u2014 i.e. , analytic thinking \u2014 is correlated with being better able to discern fake news stories from real ones . These studies haven \u2019 t looked at intellectual humility per se , but it \u2019 s plausible there \u2019 s an overlap .\nMost important of all , the intellectually humble are more likely to admit it when they are wrong . When we admit we \u2019 re wrong , we can grow closer to the truth .\nOne reason I \u2019 ve been thinking about the virtue of humility recently is because our president , Donald Trump , is one of the least humble people on the planet .\nIt was Trump who said on the night of his nomination , \u201c I alone can fix it , \u201d with the \u201c it \u201d being our entire political system . It was Trump who once said , \u201c I have one of the great memories of all time. \u201d More recently , Trump told the Associated Press , \u201c I have a natural instinct for science , \u201d in dodging a question on climate change .\nA frustration I feel about Trump and the era of history he represents is that his pride and his success \u2014 he is among the most powerful people on earth \u2014 seem to be related . He exemplifies how our society rewards confidence and bluster , not truthfulness .\nYet we \u2019 ve also seen some very high-profile examples lately of how overconfident leadership can be ruinous for companies . Look at what happened to Theranos , a company that promised to change the way blood samples are drawn . It was all hype , all bluster , and it collapsed . Or consider Enron \u2019 s overconfident executives , who were often hailed for their intellectual brilliance \u2014 they ran the company into the ground with risky , suspect financial decisions .\nThe problem with arrogance is that the truth always catches up . Trump may be president and confident in his denials of climate change , but the changes to our environment will still ruin so many things in the future .\nWhy it \u2019 s so hard to see our blind spots : \u201c Our ignorance is invisible to us \u201d\nAs I \u2019 ve been reading the psychological research on intellectual humility and the character traits it correlates with , I can \u2019 t help but fume : Why can \u2019 t more people be like this ?\nWe need more intellectual humility for two reasons . One is that our culture promotes and rewards overconfidence and arrogance ( think Trump and Theranos , or the advice your career counselor gave you when going into job interviews ) . At the same time , when we are wrong \u2014 out of ignorance or error \u2014 and realize it , our culture doesn \u2019 t make it easy to admit it . Humbling moments too easily can turn into moments of humiliation .\nSo how can we promote intellectual humility for both of these conditions ?\nIn asking that question of researchers and scholars , I \u2019 ve learned to appreciate how hard a challenge it is to foster intellectual humility .\nFirst off , I think it \u2019 s helpful to remember how flawed the human brain can be and how prone we all are to intellectual blind spots . When you learn about how the brain actually works , how it actually perceives the world , it \u2019 s hard not to be a bit horrified , and a bit humbled .\nWe often can \u2019 t see \u2014 or even sense \u2014 what we don \u2019 t know . It helps to realize that it \u2019 s normal and human to be wrong .\nIt \u2019 s rare that a viral meme also provides a surprisingly deep lesson on the imperfect nature of the human mind . But believe it or not , the great \u201c Yanny or Laurel \u201d debate of 2018 fits the bill .\nFor the very few of you who didn \u2019 t catch it \u2014 I hope you \u2019 re recovering nicely from that coma \u2014 here \u2019 s what happened .\nAn audio clip ( you can hear it below ) says the name \u201c Laurel \u201d in a robotic voice . Or does it ? Some people hear the clip and immediately hear \u201c Yanny. \u201d And both sets of people \u2014 Team Yanny and Team Laurel \u2014 are indeed hearing the same thing .\nWhat do you hear ? ! Yanny or Laurel pic.twitter.com/jvHhCbMc8I \u2014 Cloe Feldman ( @ CloeCouture ) May 15 , 2018\nHearing , the perception of sound , ought to be a simple thing for our brains to do . That so many people can listen to the same clip and hear such different things should give us humbling pause . Hearing \u201c Yanny \u201d or \u201c Laurel \u201d in any given moment ultimately depends on a whole host of factors : the quality of the speakers you \u2019 re using , whether you have hearing loss , your expectations .\nHere \u2019 s the deep lesson to draw from all of this : Much as we might tell ourselves our experience of the world is the truth , our reality will always be an interpretation . Light enters our eyes , sound waves enter our ears , chemicals waft into our noses , and it \u2019 s up to our brains to make a guess about what it all is .\n\u201c The first rule of the Dunning-Kruger club is you don \u2019 t know you \u2019 re a member of the Dunning-Kruger club \u201d\nPerceptual tricks like this ( \u201c the dress \u201d is another one ) reveal that our perceptions are not the absolute truth , that the physical phenomena of the universe are indifferent to whether our feeble sensory organs can perceive them correctly . We \u2019 re just guessing . Yet these phenomena leave us indignant : How could it be that our perception of the world isn \u2019 t the only one ?\nThat sense of indignation is called naive realism : the feeling that our perception of the world is the truth . \u201c I think we sometimes confuse effortlessness with accuracy , \u201d Chris Chabris , a psychological researcher who co-authored a book on the challenges of human perception , tells me . When something is so immediate and effortless to us \u2014 hearing the sound of \u201c Yanny \u201d \u2014 it just feels true . ( Similarly , psychologists find when a lie is repeated , it \u2019 s more likely to be misremembered as being true , and for a similar reason : When you \u2019 re hearing something for the second or third time , your brain becomes faster to respond to it . And that fluency is confused with truth . )\nOur interpretations of reality are often arbitrary , but we \u2019 re still stubborn about them . Nonetheless , the same observations can lead to wildly different conclusions .\nDifferent scientific models can have equivalent observational consequences . In # statistics , this is known as statistical equivalence ; in the philosophy of science , underdetermination of theory by # data . This GIF is a really good ( and beautiful ) # dataviz.https : //t.co/7P8wjdAjgO pic.twitter.com/eLTREWzh7F \u2014 Talia Bronshtein ( @ ininteraction ) December 7 , 2018\nFor every sense and every component of human judgment , there are illusions and ambiguities we interpret arbitrarily .\nSome are gravely serious . White people often perceive black men to be bigger , taller , and more muscular ( and therefore more threatening ) than they really are . That \u2019 s racial bias \u2014 but it \u2019 s also a socially constructed illusion . When we \u2019 re taught or learn to fear other people , our brains distort their potential threat . They seem more menacing , and we want to build walls around them . When we learn or are taught that other people are less than human , we \u2019 re less likely to look upon them kindly and more likely to be okay when violence is committed against them .\nNot only are our interpretations of the world often arbitrary , but we \u2019 re often overconfident in them . \u201c Our ignorance is invisible to us , \u201d David Dunning , an expert on human blind spots , says .\nYou might recognize his name as half of the psychological phenomenon that bears his name : the Dunning-Kruger effect . That \u2019 s where people of low ability \u2014 let \u2019 s say , those who fail to understand logic puzzles \u2014 tend to unduly overestimate their abilities . Inexperience masquerades as expertise .\nAn irony of the Dunning-Kruger effect is that so many people misinterpret it , are overconfident in their understanding of it , and get it wrong .\nWhen people talk or write about the Dunning-Kruger effect , it \u2019 s almost always in reference to other people . \u201c The fact is this is a phenomenon that visits all of us sooner or later , \u201d Dunning says . We \u2019 re all overconfident in our ignorance from time to time . ( Perhaps related : Some 65 percent of Americans believe they \u2019 re more intelligent than average , which is wishful thinking . )\nSimilarly , we \u2019 re overconfident in our ability to remember . Human memory is extremely malleable , prone to small changes . When we remember , we don \u2019 t wind back our minds to a certain time and relive that exact moment , yet many of us think our memories work like a videotape .\nDunning hopes his work helps people understand that \u201c not knowing the scope of your own ignorance is part of the human condition , \u201d he says . \u201c But the problem with it is we see it in other people , and we don \u2019 t see it in ourselves . The first rule of the Dunning-Kruger club is you don \u2019 t know you \u2019 re a member of the Dunning-Kruger club . \u201d\nPeople are unlikely to judge you harshly for admitting you \u2019 re wrong\nIn 2012 , psychologist Will Gervais scored an honor any PhD science student would covet : a co-authored paper in the journal Science , one of the top interdisciplinary scientific journals in the world . Publishing in Science doesn \u2019 t just help a researcher rise up in academic circles ; it often gets them a lot of media attention too .\nOne of the experiments in the paper tried to see if getting people to think more rationally would make them less willing to report religious beliefs . They had people look at a picture of Rodin \u2019 s The Thinker or another statue . They thought The Thinker would nudge people to think harder , more analytically . In this more rational frame of mind , then , the participants would be less likely to endorse believing in something as faith-based and invisible as religion , and that \u2019 s what the study found . It was catnip for science journalists : one small trick to change the way we think .\n\u201c How would I know if I was wrong ? \u201d is actually a really , really hard question to answer\nBut it was a tiny , small-sample study , the exact type that is prone to yielding false positives . Several years later , another lab attempted to replicate the findings with a much larger sample size , and failed to find any evidence for the effect .\nAnd while Gervais knew that the original study wasn \u2019 t rigorous , he couldn \u2019 t help but feel a twinge of discomfort .\n\u201c Intellectually , I could say the original data weren \u2019 t strong , \u201d he says . \u201c That \u2019 s very different from the human , personal reaction to it . Which is like , \u2018 Oh , shit , there \u2019 s going to be a published failure to replicate my most cited finding that \u2019 s gotten the most media attention. \u2019 You start worrying about stuff like , \u2018 Are there going to be career repercussions ? Are people going to think less of my other work and stuff I \u2019 ve done ? \u2019 \u201d\nGervais \u2019 s story is familiar : Many of us fear we \u2019 ll be seen as less competent , less trustworthy , if we admit wrongness . Even when we can see our own errors \u2014 which , as outlined above , is not easy to do \u2014 we \u2019 re hesitant to admit it .\nBut turns out this assumption is false . As Adam Fetterman , a social psychologist at the University of Texas El Paso , has found in a few studies , wrongness admission isn \u2019 t usually judged harshly . \u201c When we do see someone admit that they are wrong , the wrongness admitter is seen as more communal , more friendly , \u201d he says . It \u2019 s almost never the case , in his studies , \u201c that when you admit you \u2019 re wrong , people think you are less competent . \u201d\nSure , there might be some people who will troll you for your mistakes . There might be a mob on Twitter that converges in order to shame you . Some moments of humility could be humiliating . But this fear must be vanquished if we are to become less intellectually arrogant and more intellectually humble .\nHumility can \u2019 t just come from within \u2014 we need environments where it can thrive\nBut even if you \u2019 re motivated to be more intellectually humble , our culture doesn \u2019 t always reward it .\nThe field of psychology , overall , has been reckoning with a \u201c replication crisis \u201d where many classic findings in the science don \u2019 t hold up under rigorous scrutiny . Incredibly influential textbook findings in psychology \u2014 like the \u201c ego depletion \u201d theory of willpower or the \u201c marshmallow test \u201d \u2014 have been bending or breaking .\nI \u2019 ve found it fascinating to watch the field of psychology deal with this . For some researchers , the reckoning has been personally unsettling . \u201c I \u2019 m in a dark place , \u201d Michael Inzlicht , a University of Toronto psychologist , wrote in a 2016 blog post after seeing the theory of ego depletion crumble before his eyes . \u201c Have I been chasing puffs of smoke for all these years ? \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s bad to think of problems like this like a Rubik \u2019 s cube : a puzzle that has a neat and satisfying solution that you can put on your desk \u201d\nWhat I \u2019 ve learned from reporting on the \u201c replication crisis \u201d is that intellectual humility requires support from peers and institutions . And that environment is hard to build .\n\u201c What we teach undergrads is that scientists want to prove themselves wrong , \u201d says Simine Vazire , a psychologist and journal editor who often writes and speaks about replication issues . \u201c But , \u2018 How would I know if I was wrong ? \u2019 is actually a really , really hard question to answer . It involves things like having critics yell at you and telling you that you did things wrong and reanalyze your data . \u201d\nAnd that \u2019 s not fun . Again : Even among scientists \u2014 people who ought to question everything \u2014 intellectual humility is hard . In some cases , researchers have refused to concede their original conclusions despite the unveiling of new evidence . ( One famous psychologist under fire recently told me angrily , \u201c I will stand by that conclusion for the rest of my life , no matter what anyone says . \u201d )\nPsychologists are human . When they reach a conclusion , it becomes hard to see things another way . Plus , the incentives for a successful career in science push researchers to publish as many positive findings as possible .\nThere are two solutions \u2014 among many \u2014 to make psychological science more humble , and I think we can learn from them .\nOne is that humility needs to be built into the standard practices of the science . And that happens through transparency . It \u2019 s becoming more commonplace for scientists to preregister \u2014 i.e. , commit to \u2014 a study design before even embarking on an experiment . That way , it \u2019 s harder for them to deviate from the plan and cherry-pick results . It also makes sure all data is open and accessible to anyone who wants to conduct a reanalysis .\nThat \u201c sort of builds humility into the structure of the scientific enterprise , \u201d Chabris says . \u201c We \u2019 re not all-knowing and all-seeing and perfect at our jobs , so we put [ the data ] out there for other people to check out , to improve upon it , come up with new ideas from and so on. \u201d To be more intellectually humble , we need to be more transparent about our knowledge . We need to show others what we know and what we don \u2019 t .\nAnd two , there needs to be more celebration of failure , and a culture that accepts it . That includes building safe places for people to admit they were wrong , like the Loss of Confidence Project .\n\u201c In the end , \u201d Rohrer says , after getting a lot of positive feedback on the project , \u201c we ended up with just a handful of statements . \u201d\nThere \u2019 s a personal cost to an intellectually humble outlook . For me , at least , it \u2019 s anxiety .\nWhen I open myself up to the vastness of my own ignorance , I can \u2019 t help but feel a sudden suffocating feeling . I have just one small mind , a tiny , leaky boat upon which to go exploring knowledge in a vast and knotty sea of which I carry no clear map .\nWhy is it that some people never seem to wrestle with those waters ? That they stand on the shore , squint their eyes , and transform that sea into a puddle in their minds and then get awarded for their false certainty ? \u201c I don \u2019 t know if I can tell you that humility will get you farther than arrogance , \u201d says Tenelle Porter , a University of California Davis psychologist who has studied intellectual humility .\nOf course , following humility to an extreme end isn \u2019 t enough . You don \u2019 t need to be humble about your belief that the world is round . I just think more humility , sprinkled here and there , would be quite nice .\n\u201c It \u2019 s bad to think of problems like this like a Rubik \u2019 s cube : a puzzle that has a neat and satisfying solution that you can put on your desk , \u201d says Michael Lynch , a University of Connecticut philosophy professor . Instead , it \u2019 s a problem \u201c you can make progress at a moment in time , and make things better . And that we can do \u2014 that we can definitely do . \u201d\nFor a democracy to flourish , Lynch argues , we need a balance between convictions \u2014 our firmly held beliefs \u2014 and humility . We need convictions , because \u201c an apathetic electorate is no electorate at all , \u201d he says . And we need humility because we need to listen to one another . Those two things will always be in tension .\nThe Trump presidency suggests there \u2019 s too much conviction and not enough humility in our current culture .\n\u201c The personal question , the existential question that faces you and I and every thinking human being , is , \u2018 How do you maintain an open mind toward others and yet , at the same time , keep your strong moral convictions ? \u2019 \u201d Lynch says . \u201c That \u2019 s an issue for all of us . \u201d\nTo be intellectually humble doesn \u2019 t mean giving up on the ideas we love and believe in . It just means we need to be thoughtful in choosing our convictions , be open to adjusting them , seek out their flaws , and never stop being curious about why we believe what we believe . Again , that \u2019 s not easy .\nYou might be thinking : \u201c All the social science cited here about how intellectual humility is correlated with open-minded thinking \u2014 what if that \u2019 s all bunk ? \u201d To that , I \u2019 d say the research isn \u2019 t perfect . Those studies are based on self-reports , where it can be hard to trust that people really do know themselves or that they \u2019 re being totally honest . And we know that social science findings are often upended .\nBut I \u2019 m going to take it as a point of conviction that intellectual humility is a virtue . I \u2019 ll draw that line for myself . It \u2019 s my conviction .\nCould I be wrong ? Maybe . Just try to convince me otherwise .",

Studies have found that cognitive reflection \u2014 i.e., analytic thinking \u2014 is correlated with being better able to discern fake news stories from real ones. These studies haven\u2019t looked at intellectual humility per se, but it\u2019s plausible there\u2019s an overlap.\n\nMost important of all, the intellectually humble are more likely to admit it when they are wrong. When we admit we\u2019re wrong, we can grow closer to the truth.\n\nOne reason I\u2019ve been thinking about the virtue of humility recently is because our president, Donald Trump, is one of the least humble people on the planet.\n\nIt was Trump who said on the night of his nomination, \u201cI alone can fix it,\u201d with the \u201cit\u201d being our entire political system. It was Trump who once said, \u201cI have one of the great memories of all time.\u201d More recently, Trump told the Associated Press, \u201cI have a natural instinct for science,\u201d in dodging a question on climate change.\n\nA frustration I feel about Trump and the era of history he represents is that his pride and his success \u2014 he is among the most powerful people on earth \u2014 seem to be related. He exemplifies how our society rewards confidence and bluster, not truthfulness.\n\nYet we\u2019ve also seen some very high-profile examples lately of how overconfident leadership can be ruinous for companies. Look at what happened to Theranos, a company that promised to change the way blood samples are drawn. It was all hype, all bluster, and it collapsed. Or consider Enron\u2019s overconfident executives, who were often hailed for their intellectual brilliance \u2014 they ran the company into the ground with risky, suspect financial decisions.\n\nThe problem with arrogance is that the truth always catches up. Trump may be president and confident in his denials of climate change, but the changes to our environment will still ruin so many things in the future.\n\nWhy it\u2019s so hard to see our blind spots: \u201cOur ignorance is invisible to us\u201d\n\nAs I\u2019ve been reading the psychological research on intellectual humility and the character traits it correlates with, I can\u2019t help but fume: Why can\u2019t more people be like this?\n\nWe need more intellectual humility for two reasons. One is that our culture promotes and rewards overconfidence and arrogance (think Trump and Theranos, or the advice your career counselor gave you when going into job interviews). At the same time, when we are wrong \u2014 out of ignorance or error \u2014 and realize it, our culture doesn\u2019t make it easy to admit it. Humbling moments too easily can turn into moments of humiliation.\n\nSo how can we promote intellectual humility for both of these conditions?\n\nIn asking that question of researchers and scholars, I\u2019ve learned to appreciate how hard a challenge it is to foster intellectual humility.\n\nFirst off, I think it\u2019s helpful to remember how flawed the human brain can be and how prone we all are to intellectual blind spots. When you learn about how the brain actually works, how it actually perceives the world, it\u2019s hard not to be a bit horrified, and a bit humbled.\n\nWe often can\u2019t see \u2014 or even sense \u2014 what we don\u2019t know. It helps to realize that it\u2019s normal and human to be wrong.\n\nIt\u2019s rare that a viral meme also provides a surprisingly deep lesson on the imperfect nature of the human mind. But believe it or not, the great \u201cYanny or Laurel\u201d debate of 2018 fits the bill.\n\nFor the very few of you who didn\u2019t catch it \u2014 I hope you\u2019re recovering nicely from that coma \u2014 here\u2019s what happened.\n\nAn audio clip (you can hear it below) says the name \u201cLaurel\u201d in a robotic voice. Or does it? Some people hear the clip and immediately hear \u201cYanny.\u201d And both sets of people \u2014 Team Yanny and Team Laurel \u2014 are indeed hearing the same thing.\n\nWhat do you hear?! Yanny or Laurel pic.twitter.com/jvHhCbMc8I \u2014 Cloe Feldman (@CloeCouture) May 15, 2018\n\nHearing, the perception of sound, ought to be a simple thing for our brains to do. That so many people can listen to the same clip and hear such different things should give us humbling pause. Hearing \u201cYanny\u201d or \u201cLaurel\u201d in any given moment ultimately depends on a whole host of factors: the quality of the speakers you\u2019re using, whether you have hearing loss, your expectations.\n\nHere\u2019s the deep lesson to draw from all of this: Much as we might tell ourselves our experience of the world is the truth, our reality will always be an interpretation. Light enters our eyes, sound waves enter our ears, chemicals waft into our noses, and it\u2019s up to our brains to make a guess about what it all is.\n\n\u201cThe first rule of the Dunning-Kruger club is you don\u2019t know you\u2019re a member of the Dunning-Kruger club\u201d\n\nPerceptual tricks like this (\u201cthe dress\u201d is another one) reveal that our perceptions are not the absolute truth, that the physical phenomena of the universe are indifferent to whether our feeble sensory organs can perceive them correctly. We\u2019re just guessing. Yet these phenomena leave us indignant: How could it be that our perception of the world isn\u2019t the only one?\n\nThat sense of indignation is called naive realism: the feeling that our perception of the world is the truth. \u201cI think we sometimes confuse effortlessness with accuracy,\u201d Chris Chabris, a psychological researcher who co-authored a book on the challenges of human perception, tells me. When something is so immediate and effortless to us \u2014 hearing the sound of \u201cYanny\u201d \u2014 it just feels true. (Similarly, psychologists find when a lie is repeated, it\u2019s more likely to be misremembered as being true, and for a similar reason: When you\u2019re hearing something for the second or third time, your brain becomes faster to respond to it. And that fluency is confused with truth.)\n\nOur interpretations of reality are often arbitrary, but we\u2019re still stubborn about them. Nonetheless, the same observations can lead to wildly different conclusions.\n\n(Here\u2019s that same sentence in GIF form.)\n\nDifferent scientific models can have equivalent observational consequences. In #statistics, this is known as statistical equivalence; in the philosophy of science, underdetermination of theory by #data. This GIF is a really good (and beautiful) #dataviz.https://t.co/7P8wjdAjgO pic.twitter.com/eLTREWzh7F \u2014 Talia Bronshtein (@ininteraction) December 7, 2018\n\nFor every sense and every component of human judgment, there are illusions and ambiguities we interpret arbitrarily.\n\nSome are gravely serious. White people often perceive black men to be bigger, taller, and more muscular (and therefore more threatening) than they really are. That\u2019s racial bias \u2014 but it\u2019s also a socially constructed illusion. When we\u2019re taught or learn to fear other people, our brains distort their potential threat. They seem more menacing, and we want to build walls around them. When we learn or are taught that other people are less than human, we\u2019re less likely to look upon them kindly and more likely to be okay when violence is committed against them.\n\nNot only are our interpretations of the world often arbitrary, but we\u2019re often overconfident in them. \u201cOur ignorance is invisible to us,\u201d David Dunning, an expert on human blind spots, says.\n\nYou might recognize his name as half of the psychological phenomenon that bears his name: the Dunning-Kruger effect. That\u2019s where people of low ability \u2014 let\u2019s say, those who fail to understand logic puzzles \u2014 tend to unduly overestimate their abilities. Inexperience masquerades as expertise.\n\nAn irony of the Dunning-Kruger effect is that so many people misinterpret it, are overconfident in their understanding of it, and get it wrong.\n\nWhen people talk or write about the Dunning-Kruger effect, it\u2019s almost always in reference to other people. \u201cThe fact is this is a phenomenon that visits all of us sooner or later,\u201d Dunning says. We\u2019re all overconfident in our ignorance from time to time. (Perhaps related: Some 65 percent of Americans believe they\u2019re more intelligent than average, which is wishful thinking.)\n\nSimilarly, we\u2019re overconfident in our ability to remember. Human memory is extremely malleable, prone to small changes. When we remember, we don\u2019t wind back our minds to a certain time and relive that exact moment, yet many of us think our memories work like a videotape.\n\nDunning hopes his work helps people understand that \u201cnot knowing the scope of your own ignorance is part of the human condition,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the problem with it is we see it in other people, and we don\u2019t see it in ourselves. The first rule of the Dunning-Kruger club is you don\u2019t know you\u2019re a member of the Dunning-Kruger club.\u201d\n\nPeople are unlikely to judge you harshly for admitting you\u2019re wrong\n\nIn 2012, psychologist Will Gervais scored an honor any PhD science student would covet: a co-authored paper in the journal Science, one of the top interdisciplinary scientific journals in the world. Publishing in Science doesn\u2019t just help a researcher rise up in academic circles; it often gets them a lot of media attention too.\n\nOne of the experiments in the paper tried to see if getting people to think more rationally would make them less willing to report religious beliefs. They had people look at a picture of Rodin\u2019s The Thinker or another statue. They thought The Thinker would nudge people to think harder, more analytically. In this more rational frame of mind, then, the participants would be less likely to endorse believing in something as faith-based and invisible as religion, and that\u2019s what the study found. It was catnip for science journalists: one small trick to change the way we think.\n\n\u201cHow would I know if I was wrong?\u201d is actually a really, really hard question to answer\n\nBut it was a tiny, small-sample study, the exact type that is prone to yielding false positives. Several years later, another lab attempted to replicate the findings with a much larger sample size, and failed to find any evidence for the effect.\n\nAnd while Gervais knew that the original study wasn\u2019t rigorous, he couldn\u2019t help but feel a twinge of discomfort.\n\n\u201cIntellectually, I could say the original data weren\u2019t strong,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s very different from the human, personal reaction to it. Which is like, \u2018Oh, shit, there\u2019s going to be a published failure to replicate my most cited finding that\u2019s gotten the most media attention.\u2019 You start worrying about stuff like, \u2018Are there going to be career repercussions? Are people going to think less of my other work and stuff I\u2019ve done?\u2019\u201d\n\nGervais\u2019s story is familiar: Many of us fear we\u2019ll be seen as less competent, less trustworthy, if we admit wrongness. Even when we can see our own errors \u2014 which, as outlined above, is not easy to do \u2014 we\u2019re hesitant to admit it.\n\nBut turns out this assumption is false. As Adam Fetterman, a social psychologist at the University of Texas El Paso, has found in a few studies, wrongness admission isn\u2019t usually judged harshly. \u201cWhen we do see someone admit that they are wrong, the wrongness admitter is seen as more communal, more friendly,\u201d he says. It\u2019s almost never the case, in his studies, \u201cthat when you admit you\u2019re wrong, people think you are less competent.\u201d\n\nSure, there might be some people who will troll you for your mistakes. There might be a mob on Twitter that converges in order to shame you. Some moments of humility could be humiliating. But this fear must be vanquished if we are to become less intellectually arrogant and more intellectually humble.\n\nHumility can\u2019t just come from within \u2014 we need environments where it can thrive\n\nBut even if you\u2019re motivated to be more intellectually humble, our culture doesn\u2019t always reward it.\n\nThe field of psychology, overall, has been reckoning with a \u201creplication crisis\u201d where many classic findings in the science don\u2019t hold up under rigorous scrutiny. Incredibly influential textbook findings in psychology \u2014 like the \u201cego depletion\u201d theory of willpower or the \u201cmarshmallow test\u201d \u2014 have been bending or breaking.\n\nI\u2019ve found it fascinating to watch the field of psychology deal with this. For some researchers, the reckoning has been personally unsettling. \u201cI\u2019m in a dark place,\u201d Michael Inzlicht, a University of Toronto psychologist, wrote in a 2016 blog post after seeing the theory of ego depletion crumble before his eyes. \u201cHave I been chasing puffs of smoke for all these years?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad to think of problems like this like a Rubik\u2019s cube: a puzzle that has a neat and satisfying solution that you can put on your desk\u201d\n\nWhat I\u2019ve learned from reporting on the \u201creplication crisis\u201d is that intellectual humility requires support from peers and institutions. And that environment is hard to build.\n\n\u201cWhat we teach undergrads is that scientists want to prove themselves wrong,\u201d says Simine Vazire, a psychologist and journal editor who often writes and speaks about replication issues. \u201cBut, \u2018How would I know if I was wrong?\u2019 is actually a really, really hard question to answer. It involves things like having critics yell at you and telling you that you did things wrong and reanalyze your data.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s not fun. Again: Even among scientists \u2014 people who ought to question everything \u2014 intellectual humility is hard. In some cases, researchers have refused to concede their original conclusions despite the unveiling of new evidence. (One famous psychologist under fire recently told me angrily, \u201cI will stand by that conclusion for the rest of my life, no matter what anyone says.\u201d)\n\nPsychologists are human. When they reach a conclusion, it becomes hard to see things another way. Plus, the incentives for a successful career in science push researchers to publish as many positive findings as possible.\n\nThere are two solutions \u2014 among many \u2014 to make psychological science more humble, and I think we can learn from them.\n\nOne is that humility needs to be built into the standard practices of the science. And that happens through transparency. It\u2019s becoming more commonplace for scientists to preregister \u2014 i.e., commit to \u2014 a study design before even embarking on an experiment. That way, it\u2019s harder for them to deviate from the plan and cherry-pick results. It also makes sure all data is open and accessible to anyone who wants to conduct a reanalysis.\n\nThat \u201csort of builds humility into the structure of the scientific enterprise,\u201d Chabris says. \u201cWe\u2019re not all-knowing and all-seeing and perfect at our jobs, so we put [the data] out there for other people to check out, to improve upon it, come up with new ideas from and so on.\u201d To be more intellectually humble, we need to be more transparent about our knowledge. We need to show others what we know and what we don\u2019t.\n\nAnd two, there needs to be more celebration of failure, and a culture that accepts it. That includes building safe places for people to admit they were wrong, like the Loss of Confidence Project.\n\nBut it\u2019s clear this cultural change won\u2019t come easily.\n\n\u201cIn the end,\u201d Rohrer says, after getting a lot of positive feedback on the project, \u201cwe ended up with just a handful of statements.\u201d\n\nWe need a balance between convictions and humility\n\nThere\u2019s a personal cost to an intellectually humble outlook. For me, at least, it\u2019s anxiety.\n\nWhen I open myself up to the vastness of my own ignorance, I can\u2019t help but feel a sudden suffocating feeling. I have just one small mind, a tiny, leaky boat upon which to go exploring knowledge in a vast and knotty sea of which I carry no clear map.\n\nWhy is it that some people never seem to wrestle with those waters? That they stand on the shore, squint their eyes, and transform that sea into a puddle in their minds and then get awarded for their false certainty? \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can tell you that humility will get you farther than arrogance,\u201d says Tenelle Porter, a University of California Davis psychologist who has studied intellectual humility.\n\nOf course, following humility to an extreme end isn\u2019t enough. You don\u2019t need to be humble about your belief that the world is round. I just think more humility, sprinkled here and there, would be quite nice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bad to think of problems like this like a Rubik\u2019s cube: a puzzle that has a neat and satisfying solution that you can put on your desk,\u201d says Michael Lynch, a University of Connecticut philosophy professor. Instead, it\u2019s a problem \u201cyou can make progress at a moment in time, and make things better. And that we can do \u2014 that we can definitely do.\u201d\n\nFor a democracy to flourish, Lynch argues, we need a balance between convictions \u2014 our firmly held beliefs \u2014 and humility. We need convictions, because \u201can apathetic electorate is no electorate at all,\u201d he says. And we need humility because we need to listen to one another. Those two things will always be in tension.\n\nThe Trump presidency suggests there\u2019s too much conviction and not enough humility in our current culture.\n\n\u201cThe personal question, the existential question that faces you and I and every thinking human being, is, \u2018How do you maintain an open mind toward others and yet, at the same time, keep your strong moral convictions?\u2019\u201d Lynch says. \u201cThat\u2019s an issue for all of us.\u201d\n\nTo be intellectually humble doesn\u2019t mean giving up on the ideas we love and believe in. It just means we need to be thoughtful in choosing our convictions, be open to adjusting them, seek out their flaws, and never stop being curious about why we believe what we believe. Again, that\u2019s not easy.\n\nYou might be thinking: \u201cAll the social science cited here about how intellectual humility is correlated with open-minded thinking \u2014 what if that\u2019s all bunk?\u201d To that, I\u2019d say the research isn\u2019t perfect. Those studies are based on self-reports, where it can be hard to trust that people really do know themselves or that they\u2019re being totally honest. And we know that social science findings are often upended.\n\nBut I\u2019m going to take it as a point of conviction that intellectual humility is a virtue. I\u2019ll draw that line for myself. It\u2019s my conviction.\n\nCould I be wrong? Maybe. Just try to convince me otherwise.",
