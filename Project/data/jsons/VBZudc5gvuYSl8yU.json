This is your celebration.\n\nAnd this, the United States of America, is your country.\n\nWhat truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people.\n\nJanuary 20th 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.\n\nThe forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.\n\nEveryone is listening to you now.\n\nYou came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.\n\nAt the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens.\n\nAmericans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves.\n\nThese are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public.\n\nBut for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.\n\nThis American carnage stops right here and stops right now.\n\nWe are one nation \u2013 and their pain is our pain.

No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.\n\nWe will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again.\n\nWe stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow.\n\nA new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.\n\nIt is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American Flag.\n\nAnd whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator.\n\nSo to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words:\n\nYou will never be ignored again.\n\nYour voice, your hopes, and your dreams, will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.\n\nTogether, We Will Make America Strong Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Wealthy Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Proud Again.\n\nWe Will Make America Safe Again.\n\nAnd, Yes, Together, We Will Make America Great Again.
