The U.S. has more deaths connected to nursing homes than any country other than Brazil has in total.\n\nCOVID-19 has proved to be especially dangerous for the elderly.

Critics argue that nursing homes were vulnerable to the virus not just because they house older people in tight quarters, but also because of long-standing problems like limited resources, poor government support, underpaid staff, lack of oversight and financial structures that incentivize substandard care.

Many of the issues with the current system, they argue, can be fixed through more funding for care and staff pay, a more equitable health care system and more government accountability.\n\nPerspectives\n\nThe government should help fund at-home care for seniors\n\n\u201cThe desire is there to stay at home, but until the government takes action, nothing will change.
