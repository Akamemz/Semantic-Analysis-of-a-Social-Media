    "content": "In his latest Netflix comedy special , Dave Chappelle deftly addresses a number of the most sacred cows in American life : abortion , gun control , and\u2014of course\u2014race . Given that Chappelle sets his sights on nearly every interest group in the country , one might expect that Chappelle \u2019 s critics would come from all corners of the political spectrum .
