    "content": "NEW YORK \u2014 Bernie Sanders had just arrived at the rally , and missed the incendiary remark entirely . Many on the senator \u2019 s campaign had never even heard of Dr. Paul Song , the speaker who had just commandeered news coverage of a massive Washington Square rally in New York by referring to \u201c corporate Democratic whores . \u201d\nNevertheless , by the next morning , the campaign was forced into full scramble mode . Cable coverage of the 27,000-person rally was eclipsed by reporting on the furor surrounding the comment , requiring a Sanders response . After first resisting an apology , the campaign settled on disavowing the remark with a tweet .\nIn New York , Sanders finally hit the wall , his winning streak halted by a daily pummeling that forced him on the defensive and stopped his momentum cold . The tabloids dealt him punishing hit after punishing hit . The Democratic establishment , most of it in Hillary Clinton \u2019 s camp , piled on harder than the Sanders campaign expected . Caught up in one distraction after another \u2014 a quarrel over debate details , a back and forth with Clinton over her qualifications , a trip to the Vatican in the run-up to the election \u2014 Sanders never gained his footing or even came close to pulling off the upset victory he once predicted with frequency .\nJust two weeks before , on the night of his victory in Wisconsin , everything seemed to be going Sanders \u2019 way . He was flush with cash thanks to his energized small donors and he was riding a wave of momentum after posting six wins in the seven previous contests . His aides had just agreed to the finishing touches of a debate in New York \u2014 something Sanders himself wanted after the campaigns had initially agreed to hold it in Pennsylvania . His top staff viewed the increasingly sharp timbre and pitch of the race as confirmation that Clinton herself was frustrated with the direction of things .\nBut even then , trouble was brewing . As Wisconsin voters went to the polls , a transcript of a halting Sanders \u2019 interview with the New York Daily News editorial board earlier that week was beginning to generate online chatter , raising questions about Sanders \u2019 solutions on his wheelhouse topics like breaking up the biggest banks . The Clinton campaign quickly seized on the transcript , sending it to millions of its backers as part of a fundraising email making the case that Sanders hadn \u2019 t thought through how to accomplish his biggest goals .\nThe next day , fresh off his victory , Sanders received another hit : His advisers read in disbelief a Washington Post headline that they took to mean Clinton had questioned Sanders \u2019 qualifications for the presidency during a `` Morning Joe '' interview . It was one step too far , they thought \u2014 and Sanders himself agreed .\n\u201c She has been saying lately that she thinks that I am , quote , unquote , not qualified to be president , \u201d said a fired-up Sanders that Wednesday night , headlining a rally in Philadelphia and delivering up his harshest take yet on the former secretary of state and senator as the political spotlight started shifting fully to New York .\n\u201c Well let me , let me just say in response to Secretary Clinton : I don \u2019 t believe that she is qualified if she is , if she is , through her super PAC , taking tens of millions of dollars in special interest funds . I don \u2019 t think you are qualified if you get $ 15 million from Wall Street through your super PAC . I don \u2019 t think you are qualified if you have voted for the disastrous war in Iraq . I don \u2019 t think you are qualified if you \u2019 ve supported virtually every disastrous trade agreement , which has cost us millions of decent-paying jobs . I don \u2019 t think you are qualified if you supported the Panama free trade agreement , something I very strongly opposed and which , as all of you know , has allowed corporations and wealthy people all over the world to avoid paying their taxes to their countries . ''\nStunned Clinton staffers , according to several of them , saw it as a declaration of war . Clinton \u2019 s army of elected surrogates in New York went on the attack against Sanders , painting the suggestion as absurd and offensive , and the kind of thing one hears from a crass politician , not a political revolutionary \u2014 a message that Clinton allies said the campaign heard from Democrats as it was door-knocking across the state . Sanders was repeatedly asked to defend his claim before he eventually backed off .\nMeanwhile , Sanders \u2019 Daily News interview continued to reverberate . The senator \u2019 s campaign was surprised by the harsh reaction to it , which aides felt was out of proportion . Sanders \u2019 wife , Jane , sought to downplay it by calling it an \u201c inquisition \u201d on CNN .\nBut Clinton \u2019 s team saw it as a chance to underscore its own candidate \u2019 s message \u2014 that Sanders couldn \u2019 t follow through on his promises \u2014 and it touted sections of the interview focused on Wall Street and gun control on television and in campaign missives .\n\u201c He lost a lot of credibility , and , in many respects , he was unmasked as somebody who many people thought he might be , \u201d said Jay Jacobs , a Clinton fundraiser and Democratic National Committee member from Nassau County who helped oversee some campaign operations in the state , explaining why publicizing the transcript was an obvious move for Team Clinton . \u201c Somebody who was tapping into the anger in the electorate on the left with broad-stroke ideas that sound good , much like Santa Claus delivering gifts at Christmas time , but without the details .
