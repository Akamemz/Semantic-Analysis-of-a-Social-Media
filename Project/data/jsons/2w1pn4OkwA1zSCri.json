    "content": "Matt Latimer is a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush . He is currently a co-partner in Javelin , a literary agency and communications firm based in Alexandria , and contributing editor at Politico Magazine .\nNot long ago , the writer Peter Beinart offered an interesting idea about our 45th president : \u201c Someone should write a novel in which he runs and wins as a Democrat. \u201d Underpinning this suggestion , of course , is the highly probable possibility that at one point or another the ideologically ambidextrous Donald Trump contemplated just such a scenario .\nIt \u2019 s a fascinating thought experiment : Could Trump have done to the Democrats in 2016 what he did to the Republicans ? Why not ? There , too , he would have challenged an overconfident , message-challenged establishment candidate ( Hillary Clinton instead of Jeb Bush ) . He would have had an even smaller number of competitors to dispatch . One could easily see him doing as well as or better than Bernie Sanders\u2014surprising Clinton in the Iowa caucuses , winning the New Hampshire primaries , and on and on . More to the point , many of Trump \u2019 s views\u2014skepticism on trade , sympathetic to Planned Parenthood , opposition to the Iraq War , a focus on blue-collar workers in Rust Belt America\u2014seemed to gel as well , if not better , with blue-state America than red . Think the Democrats wouldn \u2019 t tolerate misogynist rhetoric and boorish behavior from their leaders ? Well , then you \u2019 ve forgotten about Woodrow Wilson and John F. Kennedy and LBJ and Bill Clinton .\nThere are , as with every what-if scenario , some flaws . Democrats would have deeply resented Trump \u2019 s `` birther '' questioning of Barack Obama \u2019 s origins , and would have been highly skeptical of the former reality TV star \u2019 s political bona fides even if he hadn \u2019 t made a sharp turn to the right as he explored a presidential bid in the run-up to the 2012 election . His comments on women and minorities would have exposed him to withering scrutiny among the left \u2019 s army of advocacy groups . Liberal donors would likely have banded together to strangle his candidacy in its cradle\u2014if they weren \u2019 t laughing him off . But Republican elites tried both of these strategies in 2015 , as well , and it manifestly didn \u2019 t work . What \u2019 s more , Trump did once hold a passel of progressive stances\u2014and he had friendships all over the political map . As Bloomberg \u2019 s Josh Green notes , in his `` Apprentice '' days , Trump was even wildly popular among minorities . It \u2019 s not entirely crazy to imagine him outflanking a coronation-minded Hillary Clinton on the left and blitzing a weak Democratic field like General Sherman marching through Georgia . And besides , it \u2019 s fun to think about .\nSo how , in fact , might history have changed if Trump descended that infamous golden escalator and declared his candidacy for the Democratic nomination ? And how would it be ( depressingly ) the same ?\nBelow : a guess at some of key moments from the first six months of the presidency of Donald J. Trump , Democrat :\nIn a star-studded celebrity inauguration , where attendees include Cher , Madonna , Oprah and Ellen DeGeneres , President Trump offers stirring praise to his predecessors . \u201c We are grateful to President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition . They have been magnificent , \u201d he says\u2014and with rhetoric that seem squarely aimed at the Republican leadership , slams \u201c a small group in our nation \u2019 s capital that has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. \u201d Republicans criticize the speech for its \u201c angry , bitter tone. \u201d Former President George W. Bush is heard remarking , \u201c That was some weird shit , \u201d a comment that MSNBC \u2019 s Chris Matthews calls \u201c outrageous \u201d and \u201c disrespectful . \u201d\nRepublican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham appear on Fox News to discuss \u201c widespread reports \u201d that the Russian government attempted to interfere in the U.S. election process in favor of Trump . Media Matters \u2019 David Brock calls the charge \u201c a fringe conspiracy theory advanced by a bunch of sore losers who have now lost three elections in a row. \u201d Time magazine mocks the charge with a cover showing Russian President Vladimir Putin on horseback waving a hammer and sickle and the headline , \u201c THE RUSSIANS ARE COMING : Inside the Next Vast Right-wing Conspiracy . \u201d\nAt a steel plant outside of Pittsburgh , with Secretary of State Joe Biden beaming at his side , Trump signs an executive order announcing the United States will withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement . He wins praise from union leaders and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders , who commends his former primary opponent \u201c for absolutely doing the right thing to protect the American worker. \u201d Republican leaders slam the administration for an \u201c unfree trade \u201d policy that is a \u201c bum deal \u201d for American workers\u2014but Trump calls them \u201c heartless bastards who have been outsourcing American jobs to China for decades. \u201d In a clip shared on Twitter by former British MP Louise Mensch , RT host Ed Schultz hails the move as a \u201c political masterstroke . \u201d\nInauguration night 2017 : Trump is greeted by members of the Congressional leadership including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi | Pool/Getty\nTrump signs an executive order to build a LEED-certified wall between the United States and Mexico , complete with solar panels and micro-housing units made of recycled shipping containers . House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi tells reporters that while she personally has concerns about the cost of the plan , \u201c the American people have spoken on this subject relatively recently \u201d and that she hopes it will raise wages for struggling farmworkers . The New York Daily News editorializes that \u201c the wall may well keep America safer. \u201d Speaker of the House Paul Ryan , already a front-runner to challenge Trump in 2020 , denounces the plan as \u201c too expensive , nonsensical , and it just plain won \u2019 t work . \u201d\nTrump signs an executive order placing a temporary ban on travel from seven predominately Muslin countries . White House chief of staff Ron Klain appears on Rachel Maddow \u2019 s show to point out that the Trump provision is simply built on a list of problematic counterterrorism partners put together during the Obama-Biden administration . Former members of the Obama administration also express qualified support , though a few holdovers gripe anonymously to the press . There are no nationwide demonstrations reported anywhere .\nAs he settles into his new White House digs , Trump issues a 3 a.m. tweet against Fox News that alarms conservative pundits : \u201c Rightwing media peddling LIES . May be time to rein in. \u201d Trump \u2019 s comment , and subsequent reference to the Fairness Doctrine regulating the airwaves , dominates coverage on Fox News , The Blaze , Rush Limbaugh and Breitbart but receives only muted criticism from First Amendment advocates . A Harvard Law professor opines in the New York Times , \u201c Maybe it is time to rein in the right . \u201d\nTweeting that Judge Merrick Garland was \u201c a low-energy snooze , \u201d Trump formally nominates Michelle Obama to the United States Supreme Court to replace the late Antonin Scalia . To gasps from White House reporters , a smiling Trump says , \u201c How do you like this ? Aren \u2019 t you surprised ? \u201d He extols the former first lady as \u201c a really tremendous person who calls it like she sees it. \u201d The selection wins universal praise from mainstream media outlets . \u201c I can \u2019 t believe I \u2019 m saying this , \u201d Rosie O \u2019 Donnell gushes on Twitter , \u201c but this is the best decision any president has made since Lincoln. \u201d \u201c I couldn \u2019 t be prouder , \u201d says former President Obama . \u201c But I guess this means when Michelle tells me to take out the garbage , it carries a little more weight now. \u201d Gallup registers Trump \u2019 s approval rating at 53 percent .\nMelania Trump is warmly welcomed to the set of `` The View , '' where the hosts take turns praising the first lady for her fashion sense , ability to speak multiple languages and \u201c humanizing \u201d effect on the president . \u201c She \u2019 s the most glamorous first lady since Jackie Kennedy , \u201d says Joy Behar . Copies of a special edition of People magazine focused on the first family fly off the shelves at Whole Foods and the Park Slope Co-op .\nHouse Republican leaders hold a news conference announcing that they will appoint a special committee to investigate reports of Russian interference in the 2016 election . Calling the exercise a \u201c waste of taxpayer funds , \u201d Democrats at first refuse to staff any of the committee slots , but later relent by giving Virginia Senator Mark Warner what Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe calls the \u201c thankless \u201d task of \u201c humoring \u201d the GOP . Only Fox News covers the news conference live . In one of her first public appearances since her shocking defeat in the Democratic primaries , Hillary Clinton says that Russian interference is a \u201c serious issue \u201d but doubts Republican investigative efforts are sincere . \u201c I know something about vast right-wing conspiracies , right ? \u201d she asks to laughter during a CNN town hall .\nSenate Republicans are roundly mocked in editorial pages across America for their \u201c all-night \u201d filibuster of Labor secretary nominee Elizabeth Warren . She ultimately is confirmed by a vote of 51-50 , with Vice President Sherrod Brown breaking the 50/50 tie in the Senate .\nAt the Academy Awards , Meryl Streep wins applause by denouncing Republicans for their \u201c ongoing war \u201d against women and minorities and for their outright hostility to the new administration . \u201c It is time that we as Americans put aside bitter divides and stand with our president , who is standing up for women and union workers and artists , \u201d she says to applause . \u201c Otherwise all we are left with is football and mixed martial arts , which are not the arts. \u201d President Trump tweets his approval : \u201c I agree with my good friend Meryl Streep , the GREATEST ACTRESS OF ALL TIME . \u201d\nTrump gives a widely acclaimed speech to a joint meeting of Congress , winning praise from pundits on CNN , MSNBC and even Fox , which has been more critical . ( \u201c This is the day he became president , \u201d gushes a momentarily impressed Sean Hannity . ) At an earlier lunch with Bill Clinton , the former president praised the man who defeated his wife and said , \u201c All Americans have an obligation to give him a chance to lead. \u201d Conservative websites note the prolonged looks the former president appears to give to first lady Melania Trump ; one viral GIF created by a Reddit user seems to show Bubba checking out her d\u00e9colletage .\nAfter conferring with Warren Buffet and congressional Democrats , Trump proposes a tax-cut plan that lowers taxes for middle-class Americans while raising taxes on the rich . The New York Times editorial board calls the plan \u201c sensible and essential. \u201d Vox writer Matthew Yglesias praises the provision closing the carried-interest loophole as \u201c a long-overdue FU to the hedge-fund crowd \u201d but criticizes the effect the border-adjustment tax would have on low-wage retail workers as overly regressive .\nRepublican leaders in Congress pass an Obamacare repeal bill , calling on Trump to honor his promises to change the legislation , which he once called a \u201c total disaster. \u201d The president , saying he \u2019 s \u201c heard many , many good things \u201d about the law he once derided , says he will not support a repeal plan . First daughter Ivanka Trump , who is said to be considering an informal role as a White House czar on women in the workforce , is said to have played a key role in persuading the president to take a more moderate stance . Conservative leaders , most notably Pat Robertson and Oral Roberts Jr. , lash out at the \u201c devilish \u201d influences at the White House , winning widespread condemnation in the media .\nMacy \u2019 s announces that Ivanka Trump \u2019 s jewelry collection will be expanded in all of its stores . The news comes as the Trump hotel chain announces record occupancy with prominent celebrities booking events at Trump hotels to show \u201c solidarity \u201d with his progressive agenda . Richard Painter , a former ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush White House , says it \u2019 s not a problem as the president \u201c can not have a conflict of interest . \u201d\nBill O \u2019 Reilly teases that he has received copies of Trump \u2019 s tax returns that he will release on air that evening . The stunt is widely derided by media critics in the Washington Post and New York Times , with some suggesting that the Fox News host broke the law . The `` Late Show \u2019 s '' Stephen Colbert devotes half of an entire episode to an elaborate parody mocking his longtime punching bag for the lengthy windup to what amounts to just one year \u2019 s worth of tax data .\nTrump tweets in defense of Hillary Clinton , who continues to receive bruising criticism from former aides in the press . \u201c HRC ran tough campaign and is good friend . We are making America great again together ! \u201d E.J . Dionne , appearing on `` PBS NewsHour , '' speculates that he \u2019 s just trying to \u201c keep her inside the tent \u201d and fend off a possible primary challenge in 2020 .\nTrump \u2019 s decision to donate his first year 's salary to Planned Parenthood receives scathing treatment from conservative columnists such as Bill Kristol . It is roundly praised on MSNBC , where host Joy Reid favorably compares Trump to Kennedy and FDR \u2014 \u201c wealthy men who put the needs of the working man and woman ahead of themselves. \u201d A guerrilla journalist threatens to release a clip of the president walking into an abortion clinic .\nIn his first extended interview since leaving office , Barack Obama offers words of support for his successor . \u201c He \u2019 s gone through a tough learning curve , and he \u2019 s handling it well , \u201d Obama says . He adds that he was looking forward to watching his wife get sworn in as the new associate justice of the Supreme Court , acknowledging that Trump used \u201c all of the skills he learned in \u2018 The Art of the Deal \u2019 to persuade Michelle to take the job. \u201d SCOTUSblog speculates that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will step down at the end of the current Supreme Court term , and EMILY \u2019 s List quietly begins circulating the names of acceptable replacements .\nIn a pre-Easter visit at the Vatican , Pope Francis greets President and Mrs. Trump with a broad smile and extends the scheduled meeting by 30 minutes . A Vatican spokesman later reports that the Holy Father was heartened by Trump \u2019 s expressed commitment to listen carefully to his advisers and global leaders on the \u201c essential duty \u201d of combating climate change . In remarks to reporters later that day , the president seems to undercut this by saying he \u2019 s worried about the effect the Paris climate accord could have on the \u2018 Better Deal \u2019 jobs program he is developing with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer . \u201c I could go either way , frankly , \u201d he says .\nEnding a week of \u201c will he or won \u2019 t he \u201d speculation , and numerous visits to the White House from Hollywood celebrities , Trump announces that the United States will stay in the Paris accord . He cites \u201c very interesting conversations \u201d with former Presidents Obama and Clinton , Pope Francis and Leonardo DiCaprio in making his decision .\nTrump receives a standing ovation at the White House Correspondents ' Dinner , even as conservative publications and outlets boycott the event to protest the administration \u2019 s refusal to answer questions on the Russia scandal .
