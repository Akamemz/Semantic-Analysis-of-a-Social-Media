That \u2019 s when I first became aware of a young black man attempting to change the nation and the world for the better .\nAs I stood in our tiny public housing apartment kitchen , my mother was fixated by the scene playing out on the screen of our 13-inch black and white television resting on a counter that served as a regular highway for the cockroaches that infested our home .\nMy mother was watching a news program in which a white man was talking about a black man who had become the youngest person ever to win the Nobel Peace Prize .\nThe TV news next showed a clip of the young black man speaking before tens of thousands of people . Something about his manner , his empathy and the kindness in his eyes instantly captivated me .\nOnce he began his civil rights work , King woke up every day knowing there were those determined to kill him . And yet , he never wavered from the fight . He never hid . He never gave up .\nWhile both of my parents were destructively dysfunctional alcoholics , they were also both highly intelligent and educated . When sober , they would occasionally try to feed my intellectual curiosity .\nSo after much pestering from me to learn more about the man on the TV , my mother did manage to find me a few magazines and newspapers of the time featuring Dr. King .\nThe first words of his that I read as that little boy were his \u201c I Have a Dream \u201d speech .\nAs a child who had already been evicted from multiple homes \u2013 and would be evicted from 34 by the time I turned 17 \u2013 King \u2019 s fight against discrimination and for the oppressed deeply touched me .\nKing \u2019 s wisdom taught me then \u2013 and guides me now as a conservative Christian \u2013 that we are \u201c all God \u2019 s children , \u201d born with the exact same rights . No matter our gender , no matter our color , no matter our faith , and no matter our sexual orientation , we are all born with the exact same rights that must be recognized and protected .\nWhat I came to realize is that right up until the moment he was assassinated , Martin Luther King was one of the most valiant leaders ever to walk the Earth . Ever .\nOnce he began his civil rights work , King woke up every day knowing there were those determined to kill him . And yet , he never wavered from the fight . He never hid . He never gave up . He walked the walk and led by example .\nAs someone who was later fortunate enough to work in the White House for two presidents , on a few presidential campaigns , and around politics for over 20 years , I fully understand that our nation has never been more divided nor angrier than it is now . Emotions are raw , and the rhetoric from both sides is superheated .\nFive decades after the passing of King , his wisdom , his words , and his compassion are needed now more than ever . As we pause to reflect on this great man \u2019 s life , his gifts and what could and should have been , I am convinced that his stateliness and contributions to our nation and the world have been vastly underestimated .",
