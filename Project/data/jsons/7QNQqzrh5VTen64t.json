At the same time \u2014 it \u2019 s [ only ] a plan . If I \u2019 m concerned and I ascertain , as the years go by , we need to change that plan , I will recommend those changes to the president . \u201d\nThose responses were music to the ears of Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain of Arizona and other Republican critics , who argue that Obama has set the stage for another Iraq-style implosion in Afghanistan by pulling American troops out before indigenous troops can handle security on their own .\nRepublicans are skeptical , however , that Carter \u2019 s views will count for much given what they call Obama \u2019 s track record of \u201c micromanagement . \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 m confident that he has no influence whatsoever , nor did his three predecessors , \u201d McCain told reporters during a break in the hearing . \u201c Because all of the decisions , we know , are made by three or four people and at the White House level , whether it be detainees or whether it be Ukraine or whether it be the Free Syrian Army , which all of the national security team leaders recommended and the president turned it down . \u201d\nAsked whether Carter \u2019 s relationships with National Security Adviser Susan Rice and other top White House officials could help him , McCain said , \u201c It doesn \u2019 t matter . \u201d\nSen.
