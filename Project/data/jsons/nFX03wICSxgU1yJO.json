    "content": "There are not that many Never Trumpers anymore , though the media ( and the remnant Never Trumpers ) try to fool you into thinking so . The honest Never Trumpers , the ones who thought that this orange New York real estate developer with the succession of hot wives was not a real conservative and would betray us the first chance he got , have evolved . It turns out that Donald Trump is the most consistently and effectively conservative president since Reagan . The Never Trumpers who weren \u2019 t in on the scam noticed his track record of conservative success and morphed .\nSome became actively pro-Trump . I fit in there , as the first chapter of my book Militant Normals describes . Now , I was anti-Trump , not Never Trump , since I was already Never Jeb ! and Never Felonia Milhous von Pantsuit and you can only have so many nevers in your life . Trump earned my support with his consistent and remarkable conservative achievements , so he got it . I am now an advocate , highlighting his successes , much as I do as a lawyer for clients . There are plenty of folks ready to highlight his missteps , and I seek his success .\nOthers are still freaked out about his pugnacious , allegedly unseemly manner ( which I and others consider a strong plus ) , and they became merely Trump Neutral . Many of them fret about his mean tweets and wish he had the quiet dignity that the rest of us associate with failures like George W. Bush \u2013 you know , the kind of Republicans Democrats love in retrospect . These are the folks who \u201c call balls and strikes , \u201d criticize him where they oppose him and support him ( sometimes grudgingly ) when he does something they like . Fair enough \u2013 you have to follow your principles , assuming you have any .\nWhich brings us to the cruise-shilling hacks of Conservative , Inc. , who are still ticked off that this guy came along and threw a handful of sand into the gears of the grand donor grift they had been running for three decades .\nThe Fredocons needed someplace to go , the Michael Corleones of conservatism having kicked them out of the family following their betrayal . The Never Trumpers , who have now gathered on deck at whatever sad website The Bulwark is after having gathered on the deck of the recently-sunk Weekly Standard , crave attention . That \u2019 s why whoever Charlie Sykes is \u2013 he edits The Bulwark and tweets about how conservatives have disappointed him \u2013 decided to send a leftist abortion activist to CPAC as the site \u2019 s correspondent so she could give what-for to those icky pro-life people who are trying to stop the Democrat infanticide push . But hey , when some liberal billionaire is bankrolling your Trojan horse conservative outlet , you need to walk a fine line between trying to look enough like a horse to get inside the gates but still be enough like a donkey so your benefactor keeps writing you checks .\nNow , the backlash these hacks received from the CPAC fiasco had the salutary effect of reuniting some alienated conservatives . Pretty much everyone in actual conservatism agreed ; this was a garbage move by a garbage outfit dedicated to garbage outcomes and their own personal benefit . Sykes tried to play the victim , but no one was buying what these scammers were selling \u2013 as I put it on Twitter : \u201c True Conservatism ( TM ) now means * squints * hiring a left-wing descendant of literal communists for your magazine and promoting her Marxist ramblings while having her troll pro-life events wearing your credentials . Ahoy . [ cruise ship emoji x 20 ] \u201d Too bad it took standing up together against killing babies to realize that the people at the various levels of sub-Never Trump skepticism have done so much more to unite us than divide us .\nToday \u2019 s Never Trump is a tiny group of greedy misfits whose gravy train got derailed \u2013 they would put it \u201c an elite group of select individuals of discerning taste \u201d \u2013 but we actual conservatives do spend a lot of time on manhandling them . They cite that as evidence of their lasting influence , but it \u2019 s actually the result of two other factors . The first is human nature \u2013 people hate traitors . There \u2019 s a reason civil wars tend to be so much more brutal than other wars . It \u2019 s the sense of betrayal , and the actions of turncoats like Bill Kristol \u2013 whose tiresome Twitter feed is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish from those of Senator Will Brown Side Piece and Senator Panders with Wolves \u2013 infuriate the very same people he shamelessly hustled for decades .\nThe other reason is that the Never Trumpers have a media presence utterly out of proportion to their dwindling numbers and influence . Why ? Because they say exactly what the leftist media needs them to say . You know when you get a Never Trumper on your MSNBC or CNN show , he \u2019 s going to faithfully parrot the party line of Nickleback-channel clich\u00e9 Joe Scarborough or noted particle physicist Don Lemon . When I defended Trump on CNN in 2015 , Lemon cut my mic , and I \u2019 ve never been back on CNN since ( though , hilariously they once called me begging to come on to discuss a big story because I was one of only a few in-the-know people without a non-disclosure agreement on the issue \u2013 I told them to pound sand ) .

The fact is , the likes of Jeff Flake and Charlie Sykes speak for no one who isn \u2019 t already inclined to be a Lido Deck-dweller on the upcoming Bulwark cruise .\nSo , what is their endgame ?
