Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders won overwhelming victories here in New Hampshire , beating out their closest rivals by double-digit margins . Here are five takeaways from last night 's First in the Nation primary : The Democratic primary was a bloodbath . Socialist Bernie Sanders absolutely dismantled Hillary Clinton across the board , beating her by more than 20 points . In spite of heavy , desperate demagoguery , Democratic women in the Granite State sided with Sanders by double digits , led by young women . Hillary carried voters who prioritize experience and electability . Bernie blew her away among those who prize shared values , empathy , and honesty . You think Benghazi , the email scandal , opacity on Wall Street speeches , and Clinton Foundation-related ethical questions are n't taking a toll on even Democratic voters ? This is breathtaking That screen grab of exit polling data shows Clinton getting dismantled among the 60 percent of New Hampshire Democrats who value `` caring '' and honesty as candidate characteristics . There 's no getting around it : Her weakness on empathy and trustworthiness and -- relatedly , I believe -- among young voters are dramatic general election handicaps . So is the gender gap she inspires . Sanders beat her among women , but he in New Hampshire for quite some time . She needs to win a commanding victory in the Palmetto State to prevent a growing sense of unease from metastasizing into full-blown panic.Donald Trump 's win in the Republican primary was comprehensive . When exit polls started rolling in showing two-thirds of voters in the GOP race agreeing with his controversial temporary Muslim ban , it was clear it was going to be a good night for the bombastic businessman . When fully half of Republican voters responded that they felt `` betrayed `` by their own party , it was a fait accompli . Finalized exit polling tells the story of Trump 's romp . He won by double digits among : Men and women , across all age groups , across all education levels ( except for postgraduates , but winning nearly half of all non-college grads ) , across all income groups , among Republicans and independents , and among `` very conservative '' and `` somewhat conservative '' voters ( also carrying moderates ) . He won across every issue category polled , and led the pack on every personal quality question except for `` shares my values . '' It was a rout , aided by a crowded , splintered field . Trump enters South Carolina as a double-digit favorite . And by the way , unlike Iowa , he outperformed his public polls in New Hampshire.Here 's how I assessed the state of play yesterday : `` A silver medal for Rubio here keeps him on pace to make a strong play for the GOP crown , especially as rivals continue to drop out ... The field will thin out , and Rubio will take a major step closer to the three-man race he wants . Another bronze would be an under-performance , as the conventional wisdom would take root that Rubio 's debate gaffe inflicted real damage , ramping up pressure to over-perform in at least one of the two remaining February nominating contests . Not good , but salvageable . But if the Florida Senator ends up in fourth place or worse , it 's a catastrophe for his candidacy . '' Well , the Rubio campaign finds itself staring at door number three . Rubio finished fifth , although essentially in a logjam with Cruz and Bush , both of whose final polling numbers were spot on . Given what I 'd heard from multiple sources about Rubio 's meteoric trajectory in New Hampshire internal polling after Iowa , there is now no question whatsoever that his debate confrontation with Chris Christie hurt him . Badly . Rubio admitted as much in a strikingly humble , candid speech to supporters : Rubio 's right -- he has no one to blame but himself . He stepped into a predictable trap under the brightest of lights and dealt a serious blow to one of the central rationales of his candidacy : That he 's an exceptionally gifted communicator , a quality that has allowed him to tamp down concerns about his experience . He undermined himself in a hyper-public way , at the worst possible moment . That 's not on Jeb Bush 's carpet-bombing SuperPAC . That 's not on a pugnacious Chris Christie . That 's not even on the press , which showered Rubio with praise after Iowa , then hyped his bad debate moment for days ( media narratives giveth and taketh away ) . That 's on Rubio . There 's still a long road ahead , and Rubio still has a path to the nomination , albeit much narrower than it seemed 24 hours ago ; the ' 3-2-1 ' strategy , which Rubio 's team now tells never came from the campaign , is officially inoperative . But in order to thread this needle , he 's going to have to over-perform in South Carolina and/or Nevada in order to garner any needed momentum into the crucial , delegate-heavy first half of March.Like Jon Huntsman in 2012 , Ohio Governor John Kasich more or less lived in New Hampshire for weeks , achieving a solid second place outcome ( Huntsman ended up in third with a Kasichesque 16.9 percent of the vote ) . But Kasich still lost to Trump by roughly a two-to-one margin , and he has no real capacity to mount a national campaign moving forward . Jeb Bush , on the other hand , does . But what his team is casting as an important spring board is ultimately a fourth place finish , narrowly sandwiched between Cruz and Rubio . Try this statistic on for size : Thirty-five million dollars for fourth place , after spending a fortune in Iowa with little to show for it . Meanwhile , sixth-place finisher Chris Christie -- who , like Kasich , placed almost all of his eggs in the Granite State basket -- has announced that he 's heading home to New Jersey to reassess the race . He 's ineligible for this weekend 's South Carolina debate , so it sounds like he 's likely done . Elsewhere , Carly Fiorina ( four percent ) says she 's carrying on past New Hampshire with a `` wind at her back , '' whatever that means , and Ben Carson ( two percent ) continues to confound . The end feels near for both of them.The Rubio campaign desperately wanted New Hampshire to lock in their `` three-man race '' storyline , which would have applied immense pressure on non-Trump and non-Cruz candidates to get out of the way and give Cruz and Rubio the space to take on Trump ( and each other ) in a significantly winnowed field . That winnowing has now been delayed indefinitely , much to the delight of Team Trump . A crowded , distracted and confused GOP field benefits him more than anyone else , although it arguably helps Cruz , too . Cruz wants a two-man race -- and if the status quo does n't get shaken up soon , he may get his wish . Bottom line : New Hampshire just voted for an open Socialist who literally honeymooned in the Soviet Union , and for an f-bomb-dropping nationalistic populist whose campaign is pretty well encapsulated by quotes like this : What a time to be alive .
