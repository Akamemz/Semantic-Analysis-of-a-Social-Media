    "content": "Another member of the Washington political media stepped forward Thursday to claim he was threatened by the Obama White House , shortly after the White House denied reports that an adviser threatened famed Watergate journalist Bob Woodward .\nThe latest claim comes from Lanny Davis , who served as counsel to former President Bill Clinton and later went on to write a column for The Washington Times . In a radio interview on WMAL , Davis said that a `` senior Obama White House official '' once called his editor at the Times and said that if the paper continued to run his columns , `` his reporters would lose their credentials . ''\nDavis said he `` could n't imagine why this call was made '' since he 's an Obama supporter .\nThe account comes after Woodward claimed Wednesday night that a White House aide sent him an email saying he would `` regret '' his recent reporting on the sequester battle . The aide was not identified , but an official familiar with the exchange told Fox News it was National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling -- the tone of the email was rather mixed , as it also included an apology . That was after Woodward wrote a column this past weekend claiming Obama was trying to re-write history -- regarding not only whose idea the sequester was , but also how it would take effect .\nWoodward wrote that based on his reporting earlier in the budget battle , the president was trying to move the goalposts by trying to replace the sequester with a mix of tax hikes and spending cuts -- instead of solely spending cuts .\nAfter Politico reported late Wednesday that Woodward was coming forward to claim he was threatened , a White House aide denied the claim .\n`` Of course no threat was intended , '' wrote the White House aide . `` As Mr. Woodward noted , the email from the aide was sent to apologize for voices being raised in their previous conversation . The note suggested that Mr. Woodward would regret the observation he made regarding the sequester because that observation was inaccurate , nothing more . And Mr. Woodward responded to this aide 's email in a friendly manner . ''\nWhite House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Thursday that Woodward and Obama 's advisers merely `` had a factual disagreement that I think we stand by . ''\nHe stressed that it 's clear nobody was threatening anybody , and that the tone was `` respectful . ''\nAccording to Politico , Woodward said he was `` yelled at '' by an Obama aide over his weekend column in the Post . Then , he said he received a page-long email from the aide -- apparently Sperling -- that said : `` I apologize for raising my voice in our conversation today . ... You 're focusing on a few specific trees that give a very wrong impression of the forest . But perhaps we will just not see eye to eye here . ... I think you will regret staking out that claim .
