Well , that 's because he 's the Instagram dictator staying in the background , behind the curtain , asking people to pay no mind to the Chechen military fighters he might be ordering over to fight for Russia .\nRamzan Kadyrov is the president of Chechnya , a Russian republic situated in the North Caucasus region . Multiple reports from Russia , Chechnya and Ukraine suggest that there is Chechen military involvement in the eastern part of Ukraine , fighting on the pro-Russia side . While the number of Chechens in Ukraine is hard to gauge and their existence difficult to prove , even a small number could have a deep significance .\nTo understand why this is important , one must first understand how Russia ( and many of its supporters ) plays ball . In a word ? Subversively .\n`` What 's going on with Ukraine is a classic covert operation , '' says OZY contributor and former deputy director of the CIA John McLaughlin . `` The Russians probably wo n't have to go in militarily with special forces because they are gradually stirring it up , co-opting it . '' Multiple Russian experts assume that what we see on television from Ukraine has been influenced by Vladimir Putin 's intervention .\n`` Everyone assumes this is not spontaneously generated by someone who woke up and said , 'Hey , I 'd like to be a part of Russia , ' '' says McLaughlin . `` They are doing this very indirectly . Involving the Chechens in that would be also kind of classic , to the extent that you can confuse the adversary . '' He explains that confusion makes it harder for those who oppose Russia to know what to do next , which is ultimately the aim of covert actions .\nThere are a host of reasons why Chechens in Ukraine could add confusion . It would mean introducing fighters of a different nationality with motives that seem to clash with Russia 's . Chechnya itself fought a separatist war against Russia in 1994\u20131996 , briefly winning until it lost a second war in 1999\u20132000 .\nThe wars turned into an Islamic insurgency in response to the Kremlin 's actions , geographically and politically . Kadyrov and his father , both Muslim , fought against Russia in the first war , but changed sides in the second . Given this recent history , it seems like many Chechens would be sympathetic to those fighting against Russia in Ukraine , and not willing to take up arms on behalf of Russia . So what would motivate Chechens to fight for Russia ?\n`` Kadyrov is a man who has survived by taking positions that are more pro-Russia than Russia , '' says Paul Goble , a longtime specialist on ethnic and religious issues in the post-Soviet world . He says the Chechen Republic is vastly more Islamic today than it ever was before , and Putin looks the other way because Kadyrov constantly expresses his undying love for Russia .\nAdditionally , deploying fighters works to Chechnya 's advantage because it gives them military experience in the field , something the Russian government denies them by hesitating to draft North Caucasians in big numbers , Chechens in particular . The government is worried that if it trains Chechens in how to use its weapons , they may turn around and use their training against Russia .\nChechen forces in the Ukraine can also serve as an implied threat to Russia itself , proving how many able-bodied men Kadyrov has at his beck and call . `` I find it a fascinating play by Kadyrov , a very evil man who is not stupid , '' says Goble .\nGoble points out that it may be hard for observers to distinguish Chechen forces in the eastern regions of Ukraine from the Crimean Tatars , since both groups are Muslim . `` They look similar . They could do something , and the Crimean Tatars could be blamed , '' says Goble . `` Then there 'd be more support for tough measures against the Tatars because they [ would be seen as ] dangerous Muslims , like the Chechens .
