    "content": "Glenn Thrush is senior staff writer at \u2588\u2588\u2588 Magazine . Maggie Haberman is senior political reporter for \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nOver the 25 years Hillary Clinton has spent in the national spotlight , she \u2019 s been smeared and stereotyped , the subject of dozens of over-hyped or downright fictional stories and books alleging , among other things , that she is a lesbian , a Black Widow killer who offed Vincent Foster then led an unprecedented coverup , a pathological liar , a real estate swindler , a Commie , a harridan . Every aspect of her personal life has been ransacked ; there \u2019 s no part of her 5-foot-7-inch body that hasn \u2019 t come under microscopic scrutiny , from her ankles to her neckline to her myopic blue eyes\u2014not to mention the ever-changing parade of hairstyles that friends say reflects creative restlessness and enemies read as a symbol of somebody who doesn \u2019 t stand for anything .\nForget all that troubled history , and a Clinton run for president in 2016 seems like a no-brainer , an inevitable next step after the redemption of her past few years as a well-regarded , if not quite historic , secretary of state . But remember the record , and you \u2019 ll understand why Clinton , although rested , rich and seemingly ready , has yet to commit to a presidential race ( people around her insist it \u2019 s not greater than a 50-50 proposition ) , even as she \u2019 s an overwhelming favorite .\nIf Clinton says yes , she \u2019 ll have access to a bottomless pool of Democratic political talent and cash to match all those hyperbolic pronouncements about her inevitability . If she doesn \u2019 t run , the single biggest factor holding her back will be the media , according to an informal survey of three dozen friends , allies and former aides interviewed for this article . As much as anything else , her ambivalence about the race , they told us , reflects her distaste for and apprehension of a rapacious , shallow and sometimes outright sexist national political press corps acting as enablers for her enemies on the right .\nClinton isn \u2019 t insane , and she \u2019 s not stupid . \u201c When you get beat up so often , you just get very cautious , \u201d says Mike McCurry , her husband \u2019 s former press secretary , who joined the White House team to find a first lady traumatized by the coverage of her failed Hillarycare initiative . \u201c She [ has ] had a very practical view of the media . \u2026 \u2018 I have to be careful , I \u2019 m playing with fire . \u2019 \u201d\nAnd while the white-hot anger she once felt toward the media has since hardened into a pessimistic resignation ( with a dash of self-pity ) , she \u2019 s convinced another campaign would inevitably invite more bruising scrutiny , as her recent comments suggest . Public life \u201c gives you a sense of being kind of dehumanized as part of the experience , \u201d she lamented a few weeks ago to a Portland , Ore. , audience . \u201c You really can \u2019 t ever feel like you \u2019 re just having a normal day . \u201d\nWhen asked why Clinton hasn \u2019 t done more to reach out to reporters over the years , one Clinton campaign veteran began to spin several theories . She was too busy , she was too prone to speaking her mind and the like\u2014then abruptly cut to the chase :\n\u201c Look , she hates you . Period . That \u2019 s never going to change . \u201d\nHow much is Hillary Clinton \u2019 s fear and loathing of the media going to influence her decision about whether to run in 2016 ? Of course , there are other considerations : her health , the impact of a campaign on mother-to-be Chelsea , whether the 66-year-old Clinton wants to spend \u201c the rest of her useful life \u201d being president , in the words of one confidant .\nBut consider this recent speech by one of the more improbable rising stars in Clintonworld : her tormentor-turned-defender David Brock , who exposed many of the ugliest Arkansas scandals of the Clinton years when he was a conservative investigative reporter in the 1990s . \u201c Fox has accused Hillary Clinton of murder , compared her to a murderer and suggested she commit suicide , \u201d Brock told a crowd at the University of Arkansas Clinton School of Public Service in March , arguing that she \u2019 s the ultimate victim of \u201c misogyny . \u201d\nHillary Meets the Press : The White House Years 1992 : In Hillary Clinton \u2019 s first appearance on 60 Minutes , she and her husband , in the midst of his presidential campaign , sit for a 10-minute segment to respond to reports of an affair between Bill Clinton and Gennifer Flowers . Hillary \u2019 s comment that \u201c I \u2019 m not sittin \u2019 here as some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette \u201d draws fire from the country singer herself . Clinton apologizes . 1992 : Facing conflict-of-interest allegations for her legal work in Arkansas , Clinton defends her career in comments that harden her abrasive image in the press . \u201c You know , I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas , \u201d she says , to the chagrin of stay-at-home moms . \u201c But what I decided to do was to fulfill my profession , which I entered before my husband was in public life. \u201d 1994 : Amid the Whitewater affair , Clinton makes a rare solo appearance before White House reporters , in what becomes known as the \u201c Pink Press Conference \u201d for the color of her outfit . She responds to questions for more than an hour and promises to be more accessible to the Washington press corps : \u201c I \u2019 ve always believed in a zone of privacy . \u2026 After resisting for a long time , I \u2019 ve been rezoned. \u201d 1995 : At a United Nations conference in Beijing , Clinton famously declares , \u201c It is time for us to say here in Beijing , and the world to hear , that it is no longer acceptable to discuss women \u2019 s rights as separate from human rights. \u201d While her comments are widely praised in the United States , the Chinese government , facing criticism for its one-child policy , blacks out the broadcast of the speech . 1998 : In the early stages of the Monica Lewinsky scandal , Clinton again takes to the national media to defend her husband . In an interview with Matt Lauer on the Today show , she dismisses the charges against Bill Clinton as a \u201c vast right-wing conspiracy \u2026 since the day he announced for president . \u201d\nThrough intermediaries , Clinton let Brock know she appreciated that sentiment\u2014then echoed it publicly a short time later , a welcome signal to those in her camp who felt she was too afraid to speak her mind during the 2008 presidential primary campaign she so famously lost to Barack Obama . Both Clintons still attribute that defeat to fawning coverage of her rival . \u201c The double standard is alive and well , \u201d Clinton told an audience in New York last month . \u201c And I think in many respects the media is the principal propagator of its persistence . \u201d\nThe battle lines have long since been drawn , argues Philippe Reines , a top Clinton communications adviser during her past decade in the Senate and State Department . \u201c It \u2019 s like a tennis game , \u201d he says . \u201c You guys hit the ball at us , and we hit it back\u2014over and over and over . \u201d\nNever mind that in recent years she \u2019 s been portrayed more as a globe-trotting celebrity than the paranoid man-hating leftist of \u2019 90s vintage . Or that she spent most of the time since her 2008 presidential defeat being covered by the more genteel State Department press corps , a period even Reines refers to as Clinton \u2019 s \u201c golden age \u201d of media relations .\nFor much of her career , she has remained publicly unwilling ( and , former advisers say , at times even privately incapable ) of differentiating between malicious , coordinated political attacks and the legitimate scouring of her record undertaken by responsible reporters . In 1996 , she laid down this marker in a letter to her best friend , Diane Blair , according to recently released papers . \u201c I \u2019 m not stupid ; I know I should do more to suck up to the press , I know it confuses people when I change my hairdos , \u201d Blair quoted Clinton as saying , after Blair suggested she \u201c fake \u201d a \u201c friendly \u201d attitude toward the media . \u201c I know I should pretend not to have any opinions\u2014but I \u2019 m just not going to . I \u2019 m used to winning and I intend to win on my own terms . \u201d\nClinton has gradually learned how to fake it . But to this day she \u2019 s surrounded herself with media conspiracy theorists who remain some of her favorite confidants , urged wealthy allies to bankroll independent organizations tasked with knee-capping reporters perceived as unfriendly , withdrawn into a gilded shell when attacked and rolled her eyes at several generations of aides who suggested she reach out to journalists rather than just disdaining them . Not even being nice to her in print has been a guarantor of access ; reporters likely to write positive stories have been screened as ruthlessly as perceived enemies , dismissed as time-sucking sycophants or pretend-friends .\n\u201c It \u2019 s like a war . You need both defensive and offensive air power , \u201d says Joe Conason , an author and columnist with deep connections in the Clinton camp . \u201c She \u2019 s serious about considering a run , but she \u2019 s also aware of the price she \u2019 s going to have to pay . \u2026 That \u2019 s why she might say , \u2018 Who needs this ? \u2019 \u201d\n\u201c Look , she hates you .
