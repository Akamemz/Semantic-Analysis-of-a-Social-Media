Yes , I know it seems strange on the face of it that anyone would think liberals would be responsible for the actions of ultra-conservative religious fanatics , but this is nothing new . It goes all the way back to the capture of John Walker Lind , the `` American Taliban , '' when conservative wags such as Ann Coulter declared that he naturally became a member of that violent , conservative religious sect because he was raised in Marin County , California , and was thus a liberal role model :\n`` We need to execute people like John Walker Lindh in order to physically intimidate liberals , by making them realize that they can be killed , too . Otherwise , they will turn out to be outright traitors . ''\nConservative writer Andrew Sullivan famously issued this indictment , just five days after 9/11 :\nThe middle part of the country - the great red zone that voted for Bush - is clearly ready for war . The decadent left in its enclaves on the coasts is not dead -and may well mount a fifth column .\nIt never struck these people as odd that liberals -- the coalition that includes feminists , gays and promotes religious pluralism , including atheism -- would throw in with conservative fundamentalists , but there it is .\nSullivan later apologized for his remarks . I 'm sure you 'll be shocked to learn that Coulter did not .\nThis idea never really went away , however . It 's as if some people can not conceptualize the idea that their enemies might not be in cahoots with one another .

At that time , the right was very critical of the left for allegedly failing to throw the blasphemous and insulting cartoons in the jihadists ' faces and show proper regard for Western notions of free speech by telling Muslims everywhere in no uncertain terms what they could do with their prohibition on images of the Prophet Mohammed . William Kristol of the Weekly Standard put it this way :\n[ T ] he response of Western leaders has n't been particularly encouraging -- with the notable exception of Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen of Denmark .
