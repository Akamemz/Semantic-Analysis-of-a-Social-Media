Chuck Schumer \u2019 s pitch to find 70-plus votes for a sweeping immigration overhaul is running into skeptics from his own party \u2013 Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Majority Whip Dick Durbin .\nThe top two Senate Democrats believe that the push to win more GOP senators could significantly water down the measure , arguing their party should instead focus on the more achievable goal of securing the 60 votes needed to break an expected Republican filibuster . The Democratic leaders don \u2019 t believe they should make major concessions to conservatives \u2014 mainly on issues such as border security \u2014 in order to inflate the vote tally .\nBut Schumer argues that if Democrats win only a handful of Senate Republicans , the House will balk at the Senate \u2019 s approach , imperiling the push for a comprehensive bill in this Congress .\nThe differences between the three Senate Democratic leaders underscore the delicacy of the negotiations as the Senate launches debate this week on the hot-button issue for the first time in six years .
