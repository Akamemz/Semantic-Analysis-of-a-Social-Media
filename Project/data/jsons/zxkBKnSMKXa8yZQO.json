    "content": "The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld nearly all of President Obama 's health care overhaul , in a landmark ruling that will have sweeping consequences for the economy , the election and America 's health care system .\nIn a 5-4 decision , the court ruled as constitutional the so-called individual mandate requiring most Americans to obtain health insurance starting in 2014 .\nThe ruling is a victory for the president , ensuring for now that his signature domestic policy achievement remains mostly intact . It also ensures that the law will play a prominent role in the general election campaign , as Republican candidate Mitt Romney vows to repeal the law if elected .\nObama is expected to speak publicly about the ruling later in the day .\nChief Justice John Roberts , who was appointed during a Republican administration , joined the four left-leaning justices on the bench in crafting the majority decision .\n`` The Affordable Health Care Act survives largely unscathed , '' Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg , one of those justices , declared at the end of the reading , claiming the `` setbacks '' going forward will be `` temporary blips , not permanent obstructions . ''\nThe ruling relied on a technical explanation of how the individual mandate could be categorized . Roberts , in the opinion , said the mandate could not be upheld under the Constitution 's Commerce Clause . However , it could be upheld under the government 's power to tax .\n`` The Affordable Care Act is constitutional in part and unconstitutional in part The individual mandate can not be upheld as an exercise of Congress 's power under the Commerce Clause , '' Roberts wrote . `` That Clause authorizes Congress to regulate interstate commerce , not to order individuals to engage it . In this case , however , it is reasonable to construe what Congress has done as increasing taxes on those who have a certain amount of income , but choose to go without health insurance . Such legislation is within Congress 's power to tax . ''\nRoberts stressed that the decision does not speak to the merits of the law . `` We do not consider whether the act embodies sound policies . That judgment is entrusted to the nation 's elected leaders , '' he said .\nThe ruling did rein in one element of the law -- the expansion of Medicaid across the country to take in millions of low-income Americans . The opinion allows Washington to offer more funding to states to expand the program , but says the federal government can not penalize states for not participating in the new program by withholding existing Medicaid funds .\nDemocrats , many of whom were bracing for the court striking down the mandate , celebrated the decision Thursday .\nRep. Charlie Rangel , D-N.Y. , told Fox News that the ruling `` gives us the opportunity to re-sell the bill , which we did not do before . ''\nBut Republicans vowed to re-double their campaign to repeal the still-controversial law .\n`` Today 's ruling underscores the urgency of repealing this harmful law in its entirety , '' House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement . `` Republicans stand ready to work with a president who will listen to the people and will not repeat the mistakes that gave our country ObamaCare . ''\nJustice Anthony Kennedy , who was thought to be the swing vote on the decision , joined the minority in describing the whole law as invalid .\n`` The act is invalid in its entirety , '' Kennedy said from the bench . He went on to say the administration went to `` great lengths to structure the mandate as a penalty , not a tax '' -- challenging the majority 's rationale for upholding the mandate .\nDespite the persistent resistance to the law and the possibility that it could still be repealed , the historic decision Thursday will offer some measure of vindication for Obama , who devoted the first half of his term to pushing it through Congress .\nThe overhaul was one of the central planks of Obama 's 2008 run for president . The faltering economy only later took a leading role in the race as the financial markets spiraled around the time of the party conventions . Obama , after taking the oath of office , dispatched with his administration 's recession response by swiftly passing through the roughly $ 800 billion stimulus package .\nThe president immediately pivoted back to health care . He tasked allies in Congress with working out the specifics of a proposal , a process that would play out on the national stage over the course of a year .\nAs the economy continued to struggle , the debate over the health care bill became increasingly contentious . The financial industry bailout helped spawn the Tea Party , but that movement also rallied around opposition to the health care bill -- it was assailed by critics as a `` takeover '' of American health care , even as Democrats backed off items on their original wish list such as a government-run insurance plan .\nThe January 2010 election of Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown , to fill the seat left by the late Sen. Ted Kennedy , threw a wrench into Democrats ' plans as it gave Republicans enough seats to mount a filibuster . The Senate had already passed one version of the bill , but this put pressure on the House to effectively approve it or watch their goal of health care reform wither .\nUltimately , Democrats worked out a series of deals and approved the bill , which Obama signed , delivering on a central campaign promise .
