Bernie Sanders 's ( I-Vt. ) presidential campaign .\nA handful of new liberal outside groups have cropped up in recent weeks , many of them founded by former aides and allies of Sanders and other prominent progressives . Their goals range from boosting the presidential campaign of former Vice President Joe Biden to patching what they see as electoral holes in the Democrats ' organizing strategy .\nBut the proliferation of super PACs has come at a cost for some in the progressive movement , which has long denounced the existence of such groups and the influence of money in politics .\nSanders himself has privately expressed frustration with one such super PAC , originally called Future to Believe In PAC after the Vermont senator 's campaign slogan . The group was formed late last month by a handful of former aides to Sanders 's campaign , including senior adviser Jeff Weaver , to boost Biden among progressives .\nSanders 's displeasure with the formation of the super PAC prompted its founders to change its name this week to America 's Promise PAC to avoid the appearance that it is tied to Sanders or his campaign .\nFor Weaver and others , the decision to form a super PAC appears to stem more from a sense of urgency than a genuine comfort with such groups , which can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money so long as they do not coordinate with a candidate or campaign .\nIn a memo issued on Friday , Weaver warned that lagging support and enthusiasm for Biden 's candidacy among progressives has the potential to sink the former vice president 's chances of ousting President Trump in November . America 's Promise PAC , he wrote , could help Biden `` make up that ground . ''\n`` [ D ] espite best intentions , the Biden campaign and the [ Democratic National Committee ] are far behind on digital organizing , Latino outreach and progressive coalition building - all critical to reaching and winning over Sanders supporters , '' Weaver wrote .\nChuck Rocha , a former senior adviser to Sanders who is involved in America 's Promise PAC and is spearheading the creation of another group , Nuestro PAC , said that super PACs are simply a means to an end : helping Democrats and progressives win up and down the ballot .\nUnlike traditional political action committees and political nonprofits , super PACs can act as a `` partisan hammer , '' Rocha said , a role that traditional campaigns and PACs ca n't necessarily fill .\n`` I am anti all this money in politics and if we can operate without super PACs , I would vote for that everyday , '' Rocha told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . `` But I 've got to do something right now .
