It 's a rumor-control webpage .\nUnfounded rumors \u2014 what might be called `` fake news '' \u2014 have been a problem in coping with recent disasters , according to Gary Webb , a professor and chair of emergency management and disaster science at the University of North Texas .\n`` Disasters do create a great deal of uncertainty , confusion and anxiety , '' Webb said , `` and , as a result , there is the potential for rumors to propagate . ''\nFor example , Webb said , during Hurricane Katrina , `` Vicious rumors circulated about violent assaults happening at the Superdome and convention center .

''\nThe rise of social media has exacerbated both the ability and the speed at which rumors spread .

And this is the case with Florence .\nThey 've been a recurring hoax , with phony photos on Twitter of sharks swimming up water-covered highways or falling from the sky . The rumor has been so prevalent that FEMA Associate Director Jeffrey Byard was asked about it in a briefing this week .\n`` There are sharks in the [ surrounding ] water , that 's not a rumor , '' he said . `` But , you know , I do n't think there 's a Sharknado effect or anything like that .\n`` Rumors for the sake of rumors does n't help things , '' Byard said . `` That 's just clouding a bandwidth that we have to cut through ... really BS ... and that 's not needed . ''\nWhile pictures of sharks swimming are relatively harmless , `` rumors can impede emergency responders or divert attention and limited resources during a time of great need , '' said Frank Cilluffo , director of the McCrary Institute for Critical Infrastructure Protection and Cyber Systems at Auburn University .\nCilluffo says it 's difficult to gauge the efficacy of the webpage yet since it is still in the early stages , but `` this is a positive step in the right direction . ''\nSo far , though , some of the rumors listed on the FEMA webpage look more like agency press releases , such as `` nearly $ 10 million was diverted from FEMA 's hurricane relief fund to U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement , '' which the webpage goes on to explain was actually `` diverted from FEMA 's operational budgets for travel , training , public engagement and information technology . The amount diverted is less than 1 percent of FEMA 's annual operating budget . ''\nNTU 's Webb said , `` To the extent that rumor-control page focuses on broader issues not related to a specific disaster , such as the information about the EPA and FEMA 's budget , it loses some of its value and potential impact .
