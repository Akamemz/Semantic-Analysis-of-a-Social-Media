Based on that review, we have concluded that the essay fell short of our standards and should not have been published.\n\nThe basic arguments advanced by Senator Cotton \u2014 however objectionable people may find them \u2014 represent a newsworthy part of the current debate. But given the life-and-death importance of the topic, the senator\u2019s influential position and the gravity of the steps he advocates, the essay should have undergone the highest level of scrutiny. Instead, the editing process was rushed and flawed, and senior editors were not sufficiently involved. While Senator Cotton and his staff cooperated fully in our editing process, the Op-Ed should have been subject to further substantial revisions \u2014 as is frequently the case with such essays \u2014 or rejected.\n\nFor example, the published piece presents as facts assertions about the role of \u201ccadres of left-wing radicals like antifa\u201d; in fact, those allegations have not been substantiated and have been widely questioned. Editors should have sought further corroboration of those assertions, or removed them from the piece. The assertion that police officers \u201cbore the brunt\u201d of the violence is an overstatement that should have been challenged. The essay also includes a reference to a \u201cconstitutional duty\u201d that was intended as a paraphrase; it should not have been rendered as a quotation.\n\nBeyond those factual questions, the tone of the essay in places is needlessly harsh and falls short of the thoughtful approach that advances useful debate.
