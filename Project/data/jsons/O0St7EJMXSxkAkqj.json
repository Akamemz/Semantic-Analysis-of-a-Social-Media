Book after book has been written blaming them for society \u2019 s ills , from the decline of reason to the electoral travails of the Democratic Party to the death of American democracy .\nBut the past month of sustained , mass activism against police brutality offers evidence for the defense \u2014 that sorting around identity can be inclusive , that polarization can be productive .\nThe historically multiethnic nature of the Black Lives Matter protests , and the rapid change in polling around racial issues , is partly the result of decades of polarization that have put African Americans in coalition with Hispanics , Asians , and white liberals . The Democratic Party is increasingly a coalition of people who experience racism directly or base part of their identity on opposing it ideologically . This is something new in American politics , and it carries within it real reason for hope .\n\u201c If we were ever to have a national reckoning with our legacy of racial violence , it would require immense political power on the side of the people who wanted the reckoning , \u201d says University of Maryland political scientist Lilliana Mason , who studies polarization . \u201c We \u2019 ve never had a political party that was almost entirely in agreement that systemic racism exists , particularly among the white partisans . But that \u2019 s changing very quickly . \u201d\nRacism is America \u2019 s founding sin , and it cuts the deepest divisions in our political history . But those divisions , across the 20th century , existed in both political coalitions simultaneously . In 1994 , 39 percent of Democrats , and 26 percent of Republicans , said discrimination was the main reason Black Americans had trouble getting ahead . There was a gap , but it was modest . As Michael Tesler , a political scientist who studies racial polarization at the University of California Irvine , has shown , up through the 2000s , the parties were more similar than different when polled on racial issues .\nBarack Obama \u2019 s election , the Black Lives Matter movement , and Donald Trump \u2019 s rise changed that . Race became a central division between the parties , driven by demographic changes that gave a multiethnic Democratic coalition the numbers to win power , and drove racially conservative white Democrats into the Republican Party . By 2017 , 64 percent of Democrats said discrimination was why Black Americans had trouble getting ahead , but only 14 percent of Republicans said the same . A 13-point difference had become a 50-point chasm .\nThe same massive levels of polarization were on display in the polling following George Floyd \u2019 s death . A Monmouth survey found that 71 percent of Democrats , but only 37 percent of Republicans , thought the anger driving the protests was justified . A CNN poll found 92 percent of Democrats , but only 37 percent of Republicans , believe the criminal justice system is biased against Black Americans . A CBS poll found that 76 percent of Democrats , but only 24 percent of Republicans , believed African Americans face \u201c a lot \u201d of discrimination in daily life .\nPolarization can create the conditions for overdue reckonings , for broader coalitions . When the parties were mixed , and racially conservative whites were seen as the key swing vote , racial issues were suppressed in American politics . The passage of the Civil Rights Act is the exception that proves the rule : Civil rights laws had been blocked in Congress for decades , and the rupture required to unblock them broke the party system of that era . The polarization of the parties around race and ideology \u2014 a story I tell in detail in my book Why We \u2019 re Polarized \u2014 created an incentive for one party , at least , to prioritize issues of racial justice .\n\u201c As the parties became more polarized around racial issues , it became much safer for Democratic politicians to embrace racial issues , \u201d says Christopher Stout , a political scientist at Oregon State University and the author of Bringing Race Back In : Black Politicians , Deracialization , and Voting Behavior in the Age of Obama . \u201c Even in 2008 , there was a lot of hesitancy to talk about race . Think back to Obama and Jeremiah Wright . But as white working-class voters who were racially conservative left the Democratic Party , it created space for Democrats to talk about race and be rewarded for it rather than punished for it . \u201d\nJoe Biden \u2019 s career reflects the arc of this change . As he has gotten in trouble for saying , when he entered Congress , in the 1970s , he worked often with conservative , segregationist Democrats . These weren \u2019 t just coalitions of expedience : He took positions on issues like crime and busing meant to mollify racially conservative white voters . But Biden changed alongside his party . By 2008 , those Democrats were gone , and Biden was Obama \u2019 s vice president , in an administration that cemented the Democratic Party \u2019 s identity as the party of a multiethnic America .\nThen Donald Trump emerged as a backlash candidate to Obama , further clarifying the divide for both sides . \u201c So much of what defines being a Democrat right now is hatred of Trump , \u201d says Tesler . \u201c And so much of what Trump stands for is racially resentful positions and ethnocentrism . So it became really dissonant to be a Democrat who \u2019 s not on board with a racially progressive agenda . \u201d\nToday , Biden is the Democratic Party \u2019 s expected nominee for president , his success powered by black voters , his opponent Trump , his most important supporter America \u2019 s first black president . In his first remarks after George Floyd \u2019 s death and the ensuing protests and uprisings , Biden warned white Americans that \u201c the pain is too intense for one community to bear alone , \u201d and said that \u201c with our complacency , our silence , we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence . \u201d\nIn a sharp analysis , the New York Times noted that Biden \u2019 s statement was notable for what was missing . \u201c He made no attempt to soothe the fears of those white Americans who , while sympathetic to the plight of people of color , are just as uneasy about the kind of disturbances that left parts of Minneapolis in flames Thursday night . \u201d\nA few weeks later , Sen. Amy Klobuchar ( D-MN ) dropped out of Biden \u2019 s vice presidential search and called on Biden to choose a woman of color for the ticket . \u201c After what I \u2019 ve seen in my state and what I \u2019 ve seen across the country , this is a historic moment and America must seize on this moment , \u201d she said . \u201c I truly believe , as I told the vice president last night , that I believe that this is a moment to put a woman of color on that ticket . \u201d\nIdentity politics is often tossed around as a slur , an epithet . A politics of identity is said to be exclusionary , pitting Americans against each other , denying them the common ground of shared experience . This is oft-made criticism of \u201c Black Lives Matter \u201d as a slogan , by those who prefer \u201c all lives matter. \u201d But we are seeing the rebuttal to that argument in the political reality of this moment , where 91 percent of Democrats \u2014 and 92 percent of white Democrats \u2014 express support for Black Lives Matter ( as do 40 percent of Republicans ) . A politics of identity can be inclusionary , building bridges across experiences that would otherwise remain siloed .\nThe modern Democratic Party , for reasons of both demography and ideology , takes seriously the idea that to be Black in America is a different experience than being white in America . And that has formed a coalition that now takes Black Lives Matter as a multiethnic rallying cry . As Matt Yglesias shows in his essay on \u201c The Great Awokening , \u201d white liberals now express more liberal views on some racial issues than Black Democrats . In this case , the Democratic Party \u2019 s openness to \u201c identity politics \u201d has led white liberals to a politics that reaches far beyond their own experiences .\n\u201c If Democrats want to talk about public health or the environment through a racial lens , they don \u2019 t need to worry their white base will be turned off , \u201d says Wellesley political scientist Jennifer Chudy , who studies the political dynamics of cross-racial sympathy .\nIdentity is never singular . We have many identities , some of them linked together , some of them sitting in tension . The story of modern political polarization is identities fusing together : Black , Jewish , liberal , atheist , urbanite \u2014 Democrat . White , evangelical , rural , conservative , hunter \u2014 Republican . Identity fusion creates stronger bonds of solidarity between those who share identities , and can create more conflict with those who become the out-group . It is both inclusionary and exclusionary . But for groups who \u2019 ve long been marginalized , who haven \u2019 t had the power to force their concerns and their experiences to the forefront of national politics , it can be transformative .\nThere is no action without reaction , of course . The promise of change that thrills some Americans unnerves others . Trump is president because Obama was president . We will not suddenly find agreement on America \u2019 s oldest divides , easy redemption for our oldest sins . And our political system is designed to reflect consensus , not resolve conflict . This is why , in part , polarization is so feared : It breeds government paralysis , wanton obstruction , dangerous brinksmanship .\nEven so , we should prefer the difficulties of political conflict to the injustice of suppression . Police brutality is as old as America , but it has been rare for either of our major political parties to take it seriously , much less make it \u2014 and racial inequality more broadly \u2014 central to their agendas . Change at the level America needs may not be likely , but it would be impossible if neither party was willing to fight for it . That one is beginning to do so now is the product of relentless organizing , activism , and courage among Black Americans , but it is also the product of polarization , sorting , and identity politics .\nEvery day at \u2588\u2588\u2588 , we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you , and our audience around the world , with information that has the power to save lives .
