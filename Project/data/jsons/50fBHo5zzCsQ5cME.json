In his second debate with Mitt Romney , the president delivered a comeback performance that will stand as a model for future debaters of how to right a listing ship . Obama was as good in Hempstead as he was bad in Denver . In fact , this may have been the finest debate of his career and just at the moment when he needed it most .\nNavigating the tricky shoals of the town hall format , the president laid out a persuasive case for re-election , point by point , drawing sharp contrasts with his opponent while avoiding rudeness . Obama 's arguments were not always as succinctly stated as they needed to be , and he too often strayed far from the topic at hand . But by the end of the debate , he had checked off pretty much every item on his list of `` Things I Should Have Done in Denver . ''\nIt was Obama the community organizer who showed up , a man with a message to sell and an audience to sell it to . His interaction with the participants was confident , engaged and energetic , all the qualities he had failed to muster in Round 1 . He appeared to draw strength from the 82 citizens on the stage , strength that grew as the evening progressed .\nAt times Romney seemed taken aback by this fresh incarnation of the debater he had bested two weeks ago . Both substantively and stylistically , Romney operated in Obama 's shadow in this match , second banana to the president 's leading man . Clearly this was not the role Romney intended to play .\nRomney 's defining moments were too frequently negative . His attempts to directly confront the president carried plenty of dramatic charge , but they did n't quite play out the way they must have in rehearsal . These maneuvers left an impression more of petulance than leadership .\nThe thing that really gets Romney exercised in these debates is when he thinks he 's not getting his due , which means he wastes far too much time demanding another minute or the final say or a chance to go back to something from a previous answer . Romney may believe this assertiveness makes him look strong and in command . More likely it reinforces a negative perception that the candidate needs to dispel : that of a plutocrat grabbing every last crumb he thinks he deserves . The town hall debate was a particularly inappropriate setting for Romney to display this side of himself .\nRomney 's chief problem was that he did not connect to the audience as effectively as Obama did . This became apparent every time Romney began a response with `` I appreciate that '' or `` that 's an important question , '' words that signaled his discomfort with many of the topics the voters wanted to discuss , like equal pay for women , banning assault weapons or immigration .\nJUST WATCHED Ohio Focus Group on debate high moments Replay More Videos ...
