Anyone who 's watched the American media from the Bay of Pigs forward knows that top journalists from Barbara Walters to Dan Rather to Katie Couric have sounded just like Sanders in hailing Castro 's alleged `` workers paradise '' with literacy programs and `` free health care '' and `` one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world .
