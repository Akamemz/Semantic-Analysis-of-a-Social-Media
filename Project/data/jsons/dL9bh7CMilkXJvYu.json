    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio , facing high school students Wednesday night who survived the Parkland , Florida , shooting , defended his stance on gun rights -- while changing the conversation surrounding the issue .\nAppearing at a CNN town hall in Florida , Rubio repeatedly made news on the issue of who should have access to firearms by sharing his beliefs on what would have support in the Senate , as well as taking sharp criticism from the audience , which included family members of those killed in the shooting .\nWhile its exact long term consequences may not be known , here 's what Rubio said and did that will make waves in America 's roiling gun debate in the days to come :\n1 . He says he supports raising the age to buy rifles\n`` I absolutely believe that in this country if you are 18 years of age , you should not be able to buy a rifle , and I will support a law that takes that right away , '' Rubio , a conservative , said at the CNN town hall .\nHe later added , `` I think that 's the right thing to do . ''\nCurrently , US law allows someone who is 18 and older to be able to purchase a rifle or shotgun .\nHe also said he believes there 's possibly enough votes in the Senate to change the legal age to purchase a rifle from 18 to 21 . Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona , also a Republican , said Wednesday he 'd back such a proposal .\n2 . He says he 's open to reconsidering the size of gun magazines\n`` I have traditionally not supported looking at magazine clip size and after this and some of the details I have learned about it , I am reconsidering that position and I 'll tell you why , '' he said . `` Because while it may not prevent an attack , it may save lives in an attack . ... I know there are , for example , handguns that have 17 . So we 'll have to get into that debate , but that is something I believe that we can reach a compromise ( on ) in this country , and that I 'm willing to reconsider . ''\nChanging the rules around high-capacity magazines is a big deal because it 's not among the top proposals congressional leaders have been highlighting when discussing gun violence .\nHe was responding to a question about whether lawmakers should address the creation of large capacity magazines that are capable of firing 15-30 rounds of bullets or more .\nJust because Rubio is talking about it does n't mean it will happen , but it 's a significant door that just cracked open a teeny bit . His comments were already getting attention from some of his colleagues .\n`` Sen. @ marcorubio , thank you for reconsidering your position on large capacity magazines at the CNN Town Hall - I 've got a bill waiting for you to co-sponsor , '' Sen. Bob Menendez , a New Jersey Democrat , tweeted , with a link to similar legislation\n3 . He disagreed with President Donald Trump 's proposal to arm teachers\n`` I do n't support that . ... The notion that my kids are going to school with teachers that are armed with a weapon is not something that , quite frankly , I 'm comfortable with , '' Rubio said .\nRubio 's comments are significant in that he 's breaking with the President , who is also a Republican .\nHis comments were in response to Trump , earlier Wednesday , floating the idea of arming teachers and school staff after listening at the White House to a series of emotional stories and pleas to enhance school safety .\n4 . He highlighted a proposal on law enforcement gun restraining orders\n`` I 've already announced ... a concept called a gun violence restraining order that allows authorities -- and it has to be someone in your immediate family , it has to be somebody you live with , it has to be a parent , it has to be an administrator -- can go to authorities and allow someone to not just be prevented from purchasing any firearm and allow those to be taken from them -- and the person will have due process , '' he said . `` I support that and I hope they will pass that . ''\nThis law , which is already in place in California and Oregon , allows people to petition a court to remove a person 's access to guns .\n5 . He was sharply grilled over NRA contributions and responded with 'People buy into my agenda '\n`` The positions I hold on these issues of the Second Amendment , I 've held since the day I entered office in the city of West Miami as an elected official , '' Rubio said . `` People buy into my agenda , and I do support the Second Amendment . ''\nThis was his response when asked by Cameron Kasky , a junior who survived the Parkland school shooting , whether he would stop accepting money from the National Rifle Association .\nRubio , who faced boos from the crowd , also said he would support laws that would keep guns out of the hands of a `` deranged killer . ''\nLastly , Rubio showed up for the CNN town hall knowing there would be a heated debate on guns and he 'd likely get booed often . He answered questions directed to him and defended his stances on the gun debate , and many of the event 's participants , even those who seemed frustrated with his answers , thanked him for being there .\nBoth Trump and Florida Gov . Rick Scott , a Republican , turned down CNN 's invitations to participate . Trump held a listening session at the White House on Wednesday with high school students and teachers who have been affected by school shootings .",
