But nothing would make the stakes higher than a vacancy that the next president would immediately get to fill . If Republicans succeed in blocking Mr. Obama \u2019 s appointment , it will make the party \u2019 s senators more vulnerable to the charge that they \u2019 re obstructionists who are part of the problem in Washington .\nThe issue could still end up dogging those senators who choose to support Mr. Obama \u2019 s nominee , since a vote for them would still be a vote for the Republican-controlled Senate .
