    "content": "A divided appeals court panel sided Friday with Ohio business owners who challenged the birth control mandate under the new federal health care law .\nThe business owners are two brothers , Francis and Philip M. Gilardi , who own Freshway Foods and Freshway Logistics of Sidney , Ohio. , and challenged the mandate on religious grounds . They say the mandate to provide contraceptive coverage would force them to violate their Roman Catholic beliefs and moral values by providing contraceptives such as the morning-after pill for their employees . The law already exempts houses of worship from the requirement .\nThe ruling by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is one of several on the birth control issue , which likely will be resolved by the Supreme Court . There are at least three other rulings by federal appeals courts on the mandate : One sided with Oklahoma businesses ; and two sided with the Obama administration in challenges brought by Pennsylvania and Michigan companies .\nWriting for the majority , Judge Janice Rogers Brown wrote that the mandate `` trammels the right of free exercise -- a right that lies at the core of our constitutional liberties -- as protected by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act . ''\nBrown , an appointee of President George W. Bush , said that the mandate presented the Gilardis with a `` Hobson 's choice : They can either abide by the sacred tenets of their faith , pay a penalty of over $ 14 million , and cripple the companies they have spent a lifetime building , or they become complicit in a grave moral wrong . ''\nFriday 's ruling reversed a lower court ruling that had denied the Gilardis ' request for a preliminary injunction to block the Department of Health and Human Services from enforcing the mandate against them as business owners . The appeals court ruled that the lower court erred when it concluded the Gilardis were unlikely to succeed on the merits , and sent the case back to the lower court to consider other factors for an injunction .\nBut Brown upheld the lower court 's dismissal of an injunction for the brothers ' companies , writing , `` we have no basis for concluding a secular organization can exercise religion . ''\nIn an opinion dissenting from the court 's main holding in the case , Judge Harry T. Edwards wrote that legislative restrictions may trump religious exercise . He asked what , if the Gilardis ' companies were exempted from covering contraception , would stop another company from seeking an exemption from a requirement to cover vaccines ?\n`` The mandate does not require the Gilardis to encourage Freshway 's employees to use contraceptives any more directly than they do by authorizing Freshway to pay wages , '' wrote Edwards , who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter . He added that the Gilardis remain free to publicly express their disapproval of contraceptives .\nComing from the other direction , Judge A. Raymond Randolph joined Brown 's main conclusion about the Gilardis but dissented from her conclusions about Freshway companies ' exercise of religion .\n`` Why limit the free-exercise right to religious organizations when many business corporations adhere to religious dogma ? '' asked Randolph , an appointee of President George H.W .
