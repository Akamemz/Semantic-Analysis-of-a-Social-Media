The big gay-marriage debate and probably even the big marijuana debate will almost certainly be long over by then , which means capital punishment will have center stage all to itself . Here \u2019 s your next social-issue hot potato , perhaps :\nFollow the link to Gallup and examine the partisan split . Support has fallen across the board over the past 25 years , but the decline among Republicans ( -9 ) is less than half of what it is among Democrats ( -22 ) and independents ( -21 ) . Even so , both indies ( 60 percent ) and Republicans ( 81 percent ) are still strongly in favor , and even Democrats have a near majority ( 47 percent ) . I \u2019 m skeptical that we \u2019 re headed for a future where a majority opposes CP outright , but we may be headed for one where the margin is narrower than it \u2019 s been since the mid-60s .\nQuestion : Why ? What \u2019 s driving this ? My hunch after first seeing the data was that stories about people being wrongly convicted for crimes or being disproportionately punished because of race was slowly shifting public opinion . And that may be so \u2014 but there \u2019 s nothing in the rest of Gallup \u2019 s data that suggests it . The number who believe the death penalty is applied fairly is a bit lower than it \u2019 s been in recent years but still a point higher than it was back in 2000 ; the number who say it \u2019 s applied too often is lower than it was as recently as 2004 . No dramatic shifts in either metric .\nMy next guess , fueled by a tweet by the Guardian \u2019 s Harry Enten , was that this is really just a reaction to the long decline in America \u2019 s crime rate . In theory , the safer people feel , the less sharply they \u2019 re likely to react to violent crime . Whether rightly or wrongly , many people think capital punishment deters some murders that would otherwise be committed . If there are fewer murders happening , go figure that the clamor for CP diminishes . If you look at this graph , tracking violent crime in the U.S. over the last few decades , you \u2019 ll find corroborating evidence for Enten \u2019 s theory . Crime ticked upward in the early 90s before beginning to fall steadily circa 1994 . Coincidentally , per the Gallup graph up top here , support for the death penalty maxes out in 1994 and then begins to drop . That \u2019 s the answer ! Except for one thing :\nThat comes from a Gallup poll published in 2011 showing that lots of Americans don \u2019 t actually know that crime has been dropping over time . A Pew poll published in May of this year provides additional evidence . The number of crimes committed while using a gun has fallen along with the rest of the crime rate , but a clear majority of Americans ( 56 percent ) thinks it \u2019 s gone up over the past 20 years . ( Only 26 percent knew the truth . ) How can support for capital punishment be eroding due to America becoming safer if Americans don \u2019 t know that it \u2019 s safer ? When I asked Enten , he reasoned that Americans might personally feel safer even though they \u2019 re ignorant of conditions in the country at large , and that in turn might be driving their feelings about CP . He pointed to this metric specifically \u2014 fear of walking alone at night \u2014 as possibly a better barometer of perceptions of crime . I don \u2019 t know , though ; here \u2019 s what the 2011 Gallup poll showed on that .\nNo slow and steady decline there since the mid-90s . In fact , the same Gallup poll showed a sharp sustained increase post-9/11 in the number of people who thought local crime , specifically , was increasing rather than decreasing . If being afraid for your personal safety fuels support for capital punishment , we shouldn \u2019 t be seeing a steady drop .\nExit question : So what \u2019 s the explanation , then ? I \u2019 m tempted to say it \u2019 s simply a byproduct of liberals winning the culture war ( gay marriage , legalizing marijuana ) , but that feels like a pat answer . You can be pro-SSM and pro-legalization while remaining firmly pro-CP for murderers ( trust me ) , although maybe people \u2019 s tendencies towards political orthodoxy encourage them to treat culture-war issues as a package deal .
