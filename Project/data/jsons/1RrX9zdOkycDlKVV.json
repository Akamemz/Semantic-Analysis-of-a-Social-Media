But in the wake of Donald Trump \u2019 s five-state sweep in the Northeast yesterday , it \u2019 s time to add another measure .\nBy adding Pennsylvania , Maryland , Delaware , Connecticut and Rhode Island to his New York landslide , Trump is clearly riding a wave of momentum and positive media coverage .\nBut when you get to math , the journalistic nitpickers come up with various scenarios in which Trump may not get to 1,237 , leaving him vulnerable to a contested convention . Fair enough . ( Yes , any other front-runner would have been declared the de facto nominee , but The Donald is a rather controversial fellow . )\nWhich brings us to the psychology surrounding a candidate who has won state after state in all regions of the country\u2014from Alabama to Massachusetts , from Georgia to New Hampshire , from Florida to Nevada , from South Carolina to Illinois . And look at the margins : 46 percent in Arizona , 46 percent in Florida , 47 percent in Mississippi , 60 percent in New York .\nTed Cruz won Wisconsin by an impressive 48 percent , but outside of his 44 percent victory in Texas , and nearly matching Trump with 41 percent in Missouri , most of his wins have come in caucus states where he has outperformed his rival at the inside game .\nCruz pivoted to a different target last night , saying the media were having `` palpitations '' over Trump 's expected big night and that he is the fourth estate 's `` chosen '' candidate . That 's become a standard Cruz riff , even as Trump gets more than his share of bad press and biting commentary and himself complains about the `` dishonest '' media .\nWhat 's true is that as Trump continues to pile up primary wins , the psychology shifts , and most of the media and political establishments now expect him to be the nominee\u2014whether they regard that prospect with excitement or loathing . Six in 10 Republicans say in a recent poll that the candidate with the most votes should be the party \u2019 s standard-bearer , magic number or not . Two-thirds of Connecticut Republicans said the same in an exit poll yesterday .\nThat leaves Cruz , who has way exceeded expectations in this campaign , in the position of arguing that he should be the alternative to Trump , even as he loses state after state . ( Yes , Cruz could win Indiana next week , but that doesn \u2019 t change the overall equation . )\nAnd it leaves John Kasich , who has won exactly one state\u2014his own\u2014arguing that a fractured convention should turn to him .\nThe Cruz-Kasich non-aggression pact quickly fizzled , and not just because the two rivals said they still wanted votes in the three states where they are not campaigning in deference to the other guy . It was because their supporters don \u2019 t have much in common , and they handed Trump the argument that his opponents are playing insider games to deprive him of the prize .\nPsychology isn \u2019 t everything .
