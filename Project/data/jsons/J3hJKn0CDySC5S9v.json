    "content": "Faced with mounting pressure over the spread of the coronavirus and his administration \u2019 s sluggish response to the global pandemic , Donald Trump has gone running for his one true drug . That drug is \u201c racism , \u201d and he \u2019 s ingesting it with a chaser called \u201c xenophobia. \u201d Ad Policy\nTrump is now blatantly blaming the coronavirus on China . Instead of calling it by its scientific name , Covid-19 , Trump is now using a geographic nickname ( there \u2019 s no need to repeat it ) and saying that the disease \u201c comes from China. \u201d Meanwhile , bigoted Republican senators , like John Cornyn from Texas , are making the connection more explicit , framing Chinese culture and dietary habits as the \u201c source \u201d of a string of modern diseases . Cornyn \u2019 s cultural chauvinism conveniently leaves out how our own dietary habits , which look strange to many parts of the world , contribute to the spread of everything from mad cow disease , in England , to E. coli right here . I wonder if the senator from Texas would have liked it if we called E. coli the \u201c American Pooping Cowboy Plague . \u201d\nBut their hypocrisy doesn \u2019 t matter . What does matter is that Trump and a number of Republicans are using these terms to distract people from the administration \u2019 s incompetent response to the virus . They \u2019 re giving Trump \u2019 s aggrieved white base somebody else to blame for our problems .\nTheir words are working . AAPI people from all states and backgrounds are sharing stories of hate and vitriol directed at them and their children . One man told me on Twitter that people are calling his kids \u201c coronavirus \u201d at school . An Asian man was sprayed with Febreze on the New York City subway . The NYPD arrested a 13-year-old for allegedly assaulting a 59-year-old man while making anti-Asian comments and shouting something about coronavirus .\nIf the media were doing their job , this would be the story : The president of the United States is putting lives at risk during a global pandemic by inciting violence against fellow Americans . If Trump were incorrectly blaming the coronavirus on \u201c millionaires and billionaires , \u201d and rich white people were getting beat up on the subway , the press would be all over him to answer for his hateful , divisive rhetoric . Current Issue View our current issue\nBut : Because Trump is directing his hatred at a community of color , and because white people could die from Trump \u2019 s incompetence , but only Asian Americans could die from Trump \u2019 s bigotry , the media is giving us a completely different narrative , telling us , \u201c Don \u2019 t take the bait. \u201d The \u201c bait , \u201d as I understand it , is talking about Trump \u2019 s racism instead of his incompetence . Trump , and his supporters , would rather be defending Trump \u2019 s right to be racist and horrible than his actual job performance . Fighting about racism is somehow fighting on Trump \u2019 s ground , because nearly half the country does not find Trump \u2019 s overt bigotry to be a deal breaker .\nThis is a good political argument only if you center your thoughts on the perceptions and values of Trump \u2019 s base . If you think about anybody else , the argument that we should functionally ignore Trump \u2019 s racism toward other Americans is demonstrably ridiculous .\nLook at what happened during Trump \u2019 s coronavirus press conference on Wednesday . PBS \u2019 s Yamiche Alcindor asked Trump if he was worried that his rhetoric would bring harm to Asian American communities . Trump didn \u2019 t answer the question . The next reporter , RealClearPolitics \u2019 White House correspondent Philip Wegmann , started by saying he was \u201c switching gears to a larger question here , \u201d and then asked about Trump \u2019 s \u201c message \u201d to rural Americans who were already suffering from isolation and despair before this pandemic .\nThat , my friends , is the problem in a nutshell . From the perspective of many white media professionals , talking about the president \u2019 s racist attacks on minority communities is the \u201c distraction \u201d from the \u201c larger issue \u201d of white people being depressed about coronavirus .\nThe only people taking Trump \u2019 s \u201c bait \u201d right now are members of the media who insist on reprinting and publicizing every slur that tumbles out of Trump \u2019 s vicious mouth . I \u2019 ve got a # CoronavirusChallenge every major media outlet could take right now : Stop disseminating Trump \u2019 s hate . Stop reflexively reprinting his racist nicknames for things . Stop acting like the Republican defense for such racism is a legitimate argument in the marketplace of ideas . Stop inviting guests who will defend , excuse , or double down on the president \u2019 s racism .\nFor the love of humanity , stop playing Donald Trump live ! All he does is spout lies , misinformation , and bigotry that is going to get people killed . The media should be playing Trump on a seven-second delay , at least , and bleep him out when he uses racial slurs . Hell , the broadcast networks will show the Super Bowl halftime show on a seven-second delay for fear of a pop star popping out a nipple\u2014but they won \u2019 t bleep out the president when he incites violence against Asian Americans ? There is no tenet of journalism that demands that news organizations help Trump start a hate crime spree against the AAPI community . The media is not required to be complicit in Trump \u2019 s fearmongering . The only reason it goes along is for ratings and clicks . COVID-19 We \u2019 re Struggling With the Coronavirus in Spain\u2014but We \u2019 re Vastly More Prepared Than the US Ben Ehrenreich Trump Isn \u2019 t In Charge\u2014So Who the Hell Is ?

Check out this meekly titled New York Times article . It \u2019 s a classic example of reporting on the \u201c controversy \u201d instead of reporting on the mendacity of President Trump . The three authors dedicate a couple of paragraphs to \u201c critics \u201d who take Trump to task for his racist remarks , followed by a couple of paragraphs in which Trump people defend those racist remarks . They do a bit about how public health officials refer to diseases by their scientific names , then cut the moral authority of that information by quoting Republicans talking about \u201c Spanish flu. \u201d This is the kind of coverage of Trump \u2019 s racism that gives aid and comfort to racists and legitimizes bigotry as one option among many .\nTo meet the threat of Donald Trump , in this moment and every moment , the media must do better . Who the heck cares which kind of xenophobic nicknames were used for diseases in the past ?

If the Times were really concerned about putting Republican talking points in their proper context , its reporters could write : \u201c People in the past dumped their human waste in their watersheds , used lead in paint to make the colors pop , and named viruses after the wrong thing . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s not hard to talk about Trump \u2019 s dangerous bigotry , without giving voice and a platform to that very bigotry . Astute readers will notice I \u2019 ve written a thousand words now on this topic without once referring to the coronavirus by Trump \u2019 s nickname . I \u2019 m not special , I just have a modicum of intellectual discipline when writing for public consumption . It \u2019 s not too much to ask The New York Times and The Washington Post to get at my level .\nThe media , even the Fox News segment of the media , now realizes that coronavirus is \u201c bad. \u201d They now talk about it as an \u201c infection \u201d that needs to be \u201c fought \u201d by all Americans , across all regions and industries . Trump \u2019 s racism is an infection too . And it also needs to be fought , by everybody , all the time , but especially in times of panic and hysteria . Or else it will kill people .",
