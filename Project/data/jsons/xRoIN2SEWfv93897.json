When Amash , a five-term Michigan congressman , became the first Republican legislator to make that point , the reaction revealed how determined his colleagues are to evade their responsibilities .\nMitt Romney , the Utah senator and former Republican presidential nominee who a month ago said he was `` sickened at the extent and pervasiveness of dishonesty and misdirection '' detailed by Mueller , this week praised Amash 's `` courageous statement '' but added that he disagreed with his conclusion .

''\nThe Mueller report actually makes a strong case that at least some of Trump 's attempts to interfere with the investigation of Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election involved the three elements of obstruction : an obstructive act , a nexus to an official proceeding , and a corrupt intent . When Trump tried to stop the FBI investigation of his former national security adviser , repeatedly demanded Mueller 's removal , pressed White House Counsel Donald McGahn to deny that Trump had tried to fire Mueller , urged his attorney general to take control of the Russia investigation and limit its scope , and discouraged witnesses from cooperating with it , he arguably met all three criteria .\nMueller unambiguously rejected the view , advocated by Trump 's lawyers and Attorney General William Barr , that the president can not obstruct justice by exercising his otherwise lawful constitutional powers , which include control of the Justice Department . But even if you accept that theory , it does not cover Trump 's public and private attempts to influence the testimony of witnesses such as McGahn , his former lawyer Michael Cohen , and his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort .\nThe fact that Trump 's frequently clumsy efforts to impede federal investigations were mostly unsuccessful ( mainly because of resistance by his underlings ) does not get him off the hook , since attempted obstruction is also a crime . Nor does it matter that Mueller ultimately found no evidence that anyone in the Trump campaign illegally conspired with Russian agents . Trump himself did not know the answer to that question in advance , and in any case he may have been motivated by a desire to prevent revelations that could prove embarrassing and politically damaging .\nMore to the point , as Amash noted , the `` high crimes and misdemeanors '' that justify impeachment extend beyond provable statutory violations to abuses of power that betray the public trust . Trump 's own lawyer , Rudy Giuliani , last year conceded that it `` would just be unthinkable '' for Trump to pardon himself , which `` would lead to probably an immediate impeachment , '' even though the Constitution imposes no limits on the pardon power .\nCongress might reasonably conclude that a president who uses his powers to protect himself in a less dramatic way\u2014say , by repeatedly interfering with an investigation of his own actions\u2014is unfit for office .
