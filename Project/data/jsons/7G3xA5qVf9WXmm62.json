This is the \u201c conspiracy \u201d in the book \u2019 s subtitle . And it is the thread that holds together its narrative .\nIn Mr. Farrow \u2019 s telling , by the end of July 2017 , he had nailed down the story of Mr. Weinstein \u2019 s pattern of sexual predation , and the NBC brass had begun to shut him down . He has said repeatedly that he had at least two women on the record for his story at the time he left NBC for The New Yorker . He told NPR in an interview , \u201c There is no draft of this story that NBC had that had fewer than two named women. \u201d But NBC has disputed that claim , and an NBC employee showed me what he described as the final draft of Mr. Farrow \u2019 s script , as of Aug. 7 . It had no on-the-record , on-camera interviews . ( It did have one strong piece of reporting that Mr. Farrow took to The New Yorker : an audio recording of Mr. Weinstein appearing to confess to an Italian model that he had groped her . )\nNor does Mr. Farrow provide any proof that NBC executives were acting out of fear of blackmail when they refused to air his story , a central theme he promoted on his book tour . When the ABC host George Stephanopoulos asked Mr. Farrow about \u201c the suggestion that Mr. Weinstein was blackmailing NBC News , \u201d Mr. Farrow replied , \u201c Multiple sources do say that , and the way in which that \u2019 s framed is very careful. \u201d Pressed on whether NBC had let the story go \u201c because they were afraid information about Matt Lauer was going to get out , \u201d Mr. Farrow replied , \u201c That is what the extensive conversations , transcripts , and documents presented in this book suggest . \u201d\nBut the reporting in the book does not bear that out .
