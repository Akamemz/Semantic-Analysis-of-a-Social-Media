He did not fare well . | Mark Hirsch/AP Photo 2020 elections How Joe Biden went from flop to front-runner in Iowa The former veep failed to crack 1 percent in the 2008 caucuses . But that result didn \u2019 t accurately capture the depth of his support .\nAs Iowa caucus night neared in 2008 , Joe Biden was outspent , outstaffed and up against tough competition : the historic candidacies of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton , and 2004 Democratic vice presidential nominee John Edwards .\nBut Biden had consistently attracted solid crowds to his events in the run-up . An impressive number of state legislators had endorsed him . His team felt they had held their own , and entered the evening feeling cautiously optimistic .\nThen he got creamed . Biden ended up capturing less than one percent of state delegate equivalents \u2014 0.9 percent , precisely . He dropped out of the race later that evening .\nStatistically , it was an ignominious early-state defeat for the veteran senator , and one that might not seem to bode well for his third try at the White House in 2020 .\nExcept Biden has led in nearly every Iowa poll to date since last summer .\nOne reason for the dramatic turnabout is the stature gained from his two terms as Barack Obama \u2019 s loyal vice president . But as Biden makes his first official visit to the state this week as a candidate , his Iowa supporters have another explanation for his seeming turn of fortune : his 2008 caucus results were deeply misleading , and failed to reflect his actual appeal on the ground .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the # 1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from \u2588\u2588\u2588 .
