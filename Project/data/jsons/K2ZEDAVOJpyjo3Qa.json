    "content": "In an effort to curtail hate speech against the backdrop of ongoing protests for gender , racial , and LGBTQ+ equality , Reddit has decided to shut down upwards of 2,000 communities that have a history of hate speech .\nWith nearly 430 million monthly visitors , Reddit is one of the most popular websites on the globe . The purging of these communities \u2014 which include subreddits \u201c Gender Critical , \u201d a TERF forum , \u201c The Donald , \u201d a pro-Trump forum , and \u201c CapoTrapHouse , \u201d a radical left forum \u2014 comes in the wake of several brands vowing to ban advertisements on Facebook in protest of hate speech . That movement is led by several civil rights groups .\nWhile the company did not name every community they are booting off their platform , it did give a list of at least 10 : \u201c The_Donald , \u201d \u201c Gender Critical , \u201d \u201c CapoTrapHouse , \u201d \u201c Dark Humor And Memes , \u201d \u201c Consume Product , \u201d \u201c Cum Town , \u201d \u201c ImGoingtoHellforThis2 , \u201d \u201c Wojak , \u201d and \u201c Soy Boys . \u201d\nSubreddits are user-run communities .

In this case , the company \u2019 s argument for pulling these communities is that they broke several rules .\n\u201c All communities on Reddit must abide by our content policy in good faith , \u201d the company said in a statement . \u201c We banned r/The_Donald because it has not done so , despite every opportunity . The community has consistently hosted and upvoted more rule-breaking content than average ( Rule 1 ) , antagonized us and other communities ( Rules 2 and 8 ) , and its mods [ moderators ] have refused to meet our most basic expectations . Until now , we \u2019 ve worked in good faith to help them preserve the community as a space for its users \u2014 through warnings , mod changes , quarantining , and more . \u201d\nThe statement continued , \u201c Though smaller , r/ChapoTrapHouse was banned for similar reasons : They consistently host rule-breaking content and their mods have demonstrated no intention of reining in their community . \u201d\n\u201c The_Donald , \u201d specifically , has promoted hate speech even before the 2016 election . After it was created in June 2015 , it quickly became a melting pot for extreme political ideas . Even after other communities complained to Reddit , `` The_Donald '' posts were still visible given that users are able to \u201c upvote \u201d or \u201c downvote \u201d certain posts \u2014 people with the most influence are able to drive the most popular posts to the front page of the site .\nLast year , Reddit tried measures to fix the problem by isolating \u201c The_Donald \u201d users from the rest of the site , but it was short-lived .\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center published a report on `` The_Donald '' in April 2018 , highlighting users 's paranoia about \u201c white genocide \u201d and its support of ethnic cleansing of Muslims in Myanmar .\nFurthermore , the subreddit \u201c Gender Critical \u201d is one of the site \u2019 s most active feminist communities for \u201c women-centered , radical feminists \u201d that consistently spews anti-trans rhetoric .\nWith over 64,000 members , \u201c Gender Critical \u201d users have regularly denied that trans women are women , and have vocally supported JK Rowling \u2019 s TERF tirade .\nAs seen in the `` Gender Critical '' archives , members have also blasted gender-neutral or trans-inclusive language written by trans allies , and have had hateful discussions about denying trans women access to bathrooms .\n`` Ultimately , it \u2019 s our responsibility to support our communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people , '' the company said . `` In the near term , this support will translate into some of the product work we discussed with mods .
