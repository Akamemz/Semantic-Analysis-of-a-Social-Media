The White House declined to comment .\nThe administration plans to issue separate rules rolling back Obama-era fuel economy requirements in the coming weeks . A formal announcement is tentatively set for Wednesday at the Environmental Protection Agency 's ( EPA ) headquarters and automakers and dealers have been invited to attend , industry officials said .\nGovernment officials said the timing is still in flux and could be announced later in the week .\nEPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler , speaking to a group of auto dealers , said Tuesday that `` in the very near future , the Trump administration will begin taking the steps necessary to establish one set of national fuel-economy standards . ''\nUnder Trump , federal regulators have backed freezing emissions requirements for new cars and trucks at 2020 levels through 2026 . Administration officials say its final regulation will include a modest boost in annual efficiency requirements but far less than what the Obama administration set in 2012 .\nThe Obama-era rules called for a fleetwide fuel efficiency average of 46.7 miles per gallon by 2025 , with average annual increases of about 5 % , compared with 37 mpg by 2026 under the Trump administration \u2019 s preferred option to freeze requirements .\nWheeler said the EPA would take action `` very soon '' with the U.S. Transportation Department `` to bring clarity to the proper \u2013 and improper \u2013 scope and use of the Clean Air Act preemption waiver .
