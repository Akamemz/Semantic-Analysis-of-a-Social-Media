The committee is investigating allegations that the IRS targeted conservative non-profit organizations with the words 'tea party' and 'constitution' in their names for additional scrutiny. Lerner, who headed the division that oversees exempt organizations, plans to assert her constitutional right not to answer questions. Others testifying L-R are: J. Russell George, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, Douglas Shulman, Former Commissioner, Former Commissioner,Internal Revenue Service and Neal S.
