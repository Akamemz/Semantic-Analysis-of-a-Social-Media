    "content_original": "This past Friday, the deputy director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement came to Chicago to announce a major problem: Chicago-area ICE arrests fell dramatically in 2019.\n\nThe reason? Local officials refused to play ball.\n\nSince becoming mayor, one of the things I\u2019m most proud of is our unequivocal support of Chicago\u2019s immigrant and refugee communities. It\u2019s a position directly drawn from our belief that our nation\u2019s strength lies in our diversity, and that the values which have made us a beacon of hope are sacred and need to be protected.\n\nOpinion\n\nIt\u2019s for that reason that at Wednesday\u2019s City Council meeting we passed the Accountability on Communication and Transparency Ordinance, which is designed to bolster our Welcoming City Ordinance \u2014 a policy first established by Mayor Harold Washington in 1985 and enhanced by my predecessors ever since.\n\nIn it, we are enshrining in the municipal code mandates from my previous executive actions.

This past summer, when President Donald Trump was doing everything he could to scare undocumented families into the shadows, we undertook these measures in the form of executive actions. The difference now is that we\u2019re codifying them into law, making for one of the largest expansions of immigrant protections in Chicago since the Welcoming City Ordinance first was adopted over 30 years ago.\n\nAll of which brings us to Friday\u2019s ICE press conference. As the ICE deputy director noted, it\u2019s because of our lack of cooperation that ICE was unable to reach its arrest goal.\n\nHe\u2019s right. And that\u2019s a good thing.\n\nCredit for that is shared among city and state leaders, as well as with countless local advocates \u2014 whether through the TRUST Act passed in Springfield, the vital services provided by Chicago\u2019s immigration attorneys, or the hundreds of Community Navigators supported by our Legal Protection Fund who have been doing the Lord\u2019s work of going into communities to educate and empower our undocumented immigrant families about their rights.\n\nYet, as proud as we are, it shouldn\u2019t have to be this way.
