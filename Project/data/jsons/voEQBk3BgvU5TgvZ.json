The GOP `` establishment lane '' has had a pile up right at the start and nobody can get through it . So the `` outsider lane '' is the only one available . They are coming very close to having to decide which horse to jump on and by the looks of it , they 've decided that if they have to make this unpalatable choice in order to have a chance to win the election , they will choose ... Donald Trump .\nYesterday \u2588\u2588\u2588 's Elias Isquith wrote about this , and cited a Washington Post story that had the Republican fatcat donors all starting to sniff around Trump looking for ways to curry favor now that their favorites like Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush seem to have cratered . We all know Trump can not be bought . He says so every day . Greed is simply not part of his personal character . Even more importantly , Trump has no ego so it 's very unlikely he will be influenced by flattery and sweet talk from his wealthy peers . Nonetheless they seem to think it will be worth their while to get access to him . Go figure .\nMeanwhile , The New York Times reported that retired Senator Bob Dole , always one to spill the beans even before he became an elder statesman and decided he really did n't give a damn about propriety anymore , says Trump is the establishment 's man . And he did n't mince words about reason : they just can not stand Ted Cruz .\nI question his allegiance to the party , \u201d Mr. Dole said of Mr. Cruz . \u201c I don \u2019 t know how often you \u2019 ve heard him say the word \u2018 Republican \u2019 \u2014 not very often. \u201d Instead , Mr. Cruz uses the word \u201c conservative , \u201d Mr. Dole said , before offering up a different word for Mr. Cruz : \u201c extremist. \u201d \u201c I don \u2019 t know how he \u2019 s going to deal with Congress , \u201d he said . \u201c Nobody likes him. \u201d But Mr. Dole said he thought Mr. Trump could \u201c probably work with Congress , because he \u2019 s , you know , he \u2019 s got the right personality and he \u2019 s kind of a deal-maker. \u201d The remarks by Mr. Dole reflect wider unease with Mr. Cruz among members of the Republican establishment , but few leading members of the party have been as candid and cutting . \u201c If he \u2019 s the nominee , we \u2019 re going to have wholesale losses in Congress and state offices and governors and legislatures , \u201d said Mr. Dole , who served in the House and Senate for 35 years and won the Iowa caucuses twice . He described Mr. Cruz as having falsely \u201c convinced the Iowa voters that he \u2019 s kind of a mainstream conservative. \u201d The only person who could stop Mr. Cruz from capturing the nomination ? \u201c I think it \u2019 s Trump , \u201d Mr. Dole said , adding that Mr. Trump was \u201c gaining a little . \u201d\nIt 's hard to wrap your mind around a party that thinks Donald Trump -- King of the Birthers , the man who promises to deport 12 million Latinos , bring back torture and summary execution and bar all Muslims from entering the U.S. -- is less of an extremist than Ted Cruz .
