Second , the folks elected to write these regulations know fairly little about social media and the Internet .\nProblems of that sort are endemic to the regulatory state . Relatively few of our regulations were written with a deep understanding of the industries they upended .

As is often the case , the key lies not in greater regulation , but in appreciating the trouble that existing regulations have caused . In this case , the culprit is the safe harbor provision of the Communications Decency Act ( CDA ) of 1996 .\nThat provision arose to address a very specific problem .

Over past 20-plus years , the Courts have acted as if Congress had announced that Internet sites that allowed third parties to post content were immune from all liability .

It \u2019 s no surprise that the editing has become abusive .\nIn the offline world , companies providing information must decide whether they \u2019 re community bulletin boards or newspapers . That decision determines the actions they take , the rights they reserve , and the obligations and liabilities they assume .
