    "content": "It is in connection with Paul Manafort that we encounter some genuine collusion targeting the 2016 campaign : willful collaboration among foreign governments , the Obama administration , and the Clinton campaign .\nJust a week after the campaign introduced Carter Page as a Trump foreign policy adviser , it announced that Manafort had been brought on board , too . The consultant was an old political hand , experienced managing the rough-and-tumble of a convention fight .\nManafort had longstanding , lucrative political consulting ( and other business ) arrangements with Ukrainian and Russian oligarchs who had Kremlin ties . These arrangements had already been spun into a narrative of political corruption in 2007 and 2008 by Glenn Simpson \u2014 then a Wall Street Journal scribe . In 2016 , as the Fusion GPS impresario , Simpson would pull these articles off the shelf to help weave the Russia-gate tale .\nFLURRY OF HOUSE DEMS BACK IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY , AS CAUCUS PLANS TO DISCUSS UKRAINE WHiSTLEBLOWER MATTER\nIn February 2014 , the Ukrainian Euromaidan uprising finally forced the flight to Moscow of Manafort \u2019 s client , Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych . With American attention intensifying as tensions boiled over in Kiev , Manafort reentered the FBI \u2019 s investigative cross-hairs , as did other American political consultants who did work that benefitted the Party of Regions .\nYanukovych \u2019 s abdication delighted the Obama administration , which was quick to back the new administration of President Petro Poroshenko . Kiev became so dependent on Washington for desperately needed financial support that , by threatening to withhold funds , Vice President Joe Biden pressured Poroshenko into firing Viktor Shokin , one of his top prosecutors . Shokin just happened to be investigating a natural gas company called Burisma , which just happened to have placed Hunter Biden , the vice president \u2019 s son , on its board of directors .\nWhile the Veep pushed the International Monetary Fund to grant Ukraine a $ 17.5 billion loan package , Burisma lavishly compensated Hunter \u2019 s law firm , to the tune of more than $ 3 million over an eighteen-month span . A lot of money ? Sure , but it \u2019 s chump change compared to the Chinese government \u2019 s $ 1.5 billion infusion in a joint investment fund with Hunter Biden while Vice President Biden , administration point-man on China issue , turned a blind eye to Beijing \u2019 s aggression in the South China Sea .\nUnder the circumstances , it may seem ironic that the Obama administration prodded Ukraine to establish a National Anti-Corruption Bureau ( NABU ) \u2014 but the IMF , like most progressive institutions , is duly impressed by such Orwellian titles . Naturally , the fledgling NABU developed a close-knit relationship with the FBI .\nIn 2014 , NABU alerted the bureau to a ledger said to have belonged to Yanukovych , b\u00eate noire of the new Ukrainian government . The ledger purports to show $ 12.7 million in cash payments to Manafort . The FBI used the information to interview Manafort , but the authenticity of the ledger has not been established . Manafort dismisses it as fake , contending that the Party of Regions paid him by wire transfer , not cash . Ukrainian officials have conceded that they can not prove the payments reflected in the ledger were made . The case was thus reportedly closed with no charges . ( Perhaps not coincidental to the Obama Justice Department \u2019 s decision not to pursue the case : Manafort had brought influential Democrats into his Ukrainian work , such as former Obama White House Counsel Greg Craig and the consulting firm started by Obama and Clinton adviser John Podesta \u2014 a firm that is still run by Podesta \u2019 s brother . )\nBut then came 2016 , and sudden renewed interest in the Manafort- Ukraine investigation \u2026 just as the U.S. presidential campaign kicked into high gear .\nContrary to the media-Democrat collusion narrative , Manafort had pleaded with Yanukovych to chart Ukraine \u2019 s course toward the EU rather than Russia . It was the Ukrainian president \u2019 s rejection of this advice that sparked the protests and his flight to Moscow . Afterwards , Manafort busied himself by propping up a new Ukrainian political organization , the Opposition Bloc , to supplant the Party of Regions .\nThat put Manafort on the radar screen of Alexandra Chalupa , a Ukrainian-American and a DNC consultant who was all in for Hillary . Chalupa is said to have had an inkling that Manafort would become involved in the Trump campaign . Why she did is an interesting and thus far unanswered question .\nTo be sure , if it was conjecture , it would have been sensible conjecture : a Ukrainian keeping tabs on Manafort would know he was a friend and former political consulting business partner of Roger Stone , who was himself vigorously supporting Trump \u2019 s bid . Manafort was itching to get back into the American political arena , and Trump \u2019 s steamrolling campaign would be a logical landing place .\nChalupa also had good sources in Kiev who were focused on Manafort . These included Serhiy Leshchenko , a Ukrainian legislator opposed to Yanukovych \u2019 s Party of Regions and the Opposition Bloc , and Artem Sytnyk , NABU \u2019 s director . It was Sytnyk who took over and quietly closed the investigation of Burisma after Vice President Biden got Poroshenko to pink-slip the prosecutor .\nLeshchenko just happens to be a vassal of Victor Pinchuk , a Ukrainian billionaire who just happens to give millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation . Wonder of wonders , Leshchenko took a public , strident anti-Trump position during the U.S. campaign \u2014 highly unusual for a foreign parliamentarian . \u201c A Trump presidency would change the pro-Ukrainian agenda in American foreign policy , \u201d he told the Financial Times , so it was \u201c important to show not only the corruption aspect \u201d of the mogul , but also that Trump was \u201c a pro-Russian candidate who can break the geopo- litical balance in the world. \u201d That , he added , was why most Ukrainian politicians were \u201c on Hillary Clinton \u2019 s side. \u201d ( I \u2019 m sure she was thrilled about the enthusiasm in Kiev , but enthusiasm in Wisconsin might have been more helpful . )\nDuring the same early 2016 weeks when Chalupa was tapping her Ukrainian sources and giving Democrats a heads-up about a potential Manafort-Trump alliance , NABU investigators and Ukrainian prosecutors journeyed to Washington . There , the Obama administration arranged for them to huddle with the FBI , the Justice Department , the State Department , and the White House \u2019 s National Security Council ( agencies that coordinated frequently throughout the collusion caper ) . Andrii Telizhenko , a political officer at Ukraine \u2019 s embassy in Washington , later told The Hill \u2019 s John Solomon that the U.S. officials uniformly stressed \u201c how important it was that all of our anti-corruption efforts be united. \u201d The officials also indicated to their Ukrainian counterparts that they were keen to revive the investigation of payments by Yanukovych \u2019 s ousted Party of Regions government to an American political consultant \u2014 i.e. , the FBI \u2019 s Paul Manafort probe . I know this may be hard to believe , but the Obama officials seem to have been less interested in Greg Craig than in Manafort .\nNazar Kholodnitskiy , Ukraine \u2019 s chief anti-corruption prosecutor , told Solomon that soon after the January 2016 Washington meetings , he found that Ukrainian officials were effectively meddling in the American presidential election . Another top Ukrainian lawman , Kostiantyn Kulyk , recalled that after the Kiev contingent \u2019 s return home from the United States , there was lots of buzz about helping the Americans with the Party of Regions investigation .\nWhich brings us back to Serhiy Leshchenko , Ukraine \u2019 s unabashed Clinton backer . And whaddya know \u2014 besides serving the government in Kiev and providing scintillating geopolitical analysis , Leshchenko had a side job : he was a source for ... wait for it ... Fusion GPS \u2014 the Clinton campaign-opposition arm , led by Glenn Simpson , which later dreamed up the Steele dossier .\nTurns out it was Leshchenko ( along with NABU chief Sytnyk ) who leaked the unverified Yanukovych ledger to the media in May 2016 , just after it was announced that Trump had made Manafort his campaign chairman . There is also a pending investigation into whether Leshchenko attempted to blackmail Manafort by sending text messages to the consultant and his daughter , threatening to give NABU , the FBI , and the media \u201c bulletproof \u201d evidence of Manafort \u2019 s financial dealings with Yanukovych .\nThe ledger \u2019 s exposure , of course , is what led to Manafort \u2019 s ouster as Donald Trump \u2019 s campaign chairman . The Ukrainian payments became an important strand of the Russia-gate narrative . The wealth that Manafort \u2019 s Ukrainian work generated formed the foundation of his prosecution by Special Counsel Mueller for tax , money laundering , and unregistered foreign-agent offenses .\nCan anyone say `` Clinton campaign collusion with Ukraine '' ? The Ukrainian courts can : In December 2018 , one such tribunal ruled that Leshchenko and Sytnyk had violated Ukrainian law by leaking the ledger . The infraction , the court added , \u201c led to interference in the electoral processes of the United States in 2016 and harmed the interests of Ukraine as a state .",
