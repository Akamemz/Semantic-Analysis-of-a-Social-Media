    "content": "As the president \u2019 s trade agenda approaches reality this week , misconceptions about it abound \u2013 partly because the noisy arguments for and against it have obscured the issue , and partly because of the emotionalism that trade stirs up .\nThe trade debate is a combination of both factual information about what \u2019 s actually in the legislation and of emotions about job loss , says Gary Chaison , a professor of labor relations at Clark University in Worcester , Ma .\n\u201c Trade agreements are always difficult because they are very emotional things , \u201d he says . They invariably benefit some people and negatively affect others . \u201c For the winners we look at the facts , and for the losers we look at emotions . \u201d\nOn Wednesday , the Senate passed `` fast track , '' which prevents Congress from amending trade bills negotiated by President Obama , by a 60-to-38 vote . That now goes to Mr. Obama 's desk for a signature . It also approved assistance for workers displaced by global trade . That goes back to the House for final approval .\nWith all that in mind , here are five common misconceptions about free trade agreements and the president \u2019 s trade agenda .\nFiguring job losses and gains from trade is not an exact science .\nOpponents argue vigorously that trade deals such as the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) are job killers and wage suppressors , while proponents argue they lead to economic growth .\nBut in April , the independent Congressional Research Service reported that \u201c the overall economic impact of NAFTA is difficult to measure \u201d because trade and investment are influenced by many variables . \u201c NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters , \u201d it concluded .\nPredicting losses or gains from the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2013 the historic trade deal that the US is negotiating with 11 other Pacific Rim nations \u2013 is even harder because it involves so many countries , says Steve Bell , senior director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank in Washington .\nIt \u2019 s \u201c virtually impossible to estimate with any reliability the job impact or the cost impact or the [ economic ] impact . People who say that are pretty much making that stuff up , \u201d he says .\nFor that reason , he and others argue , trade deals should be judged on whether they expand America \u2019 s positive influence in the world , whether they break down export barriers to US goods , and whether they improve labor , environmental , and human rights standards abroad .\nProfessor Chaison argues they must be accompanied by assistance for displaced American workers , because \u201c we don \u2019 t fully appreciate \u201d the radical way in which real people \u2019 s lives can be harmed by trade .\nChina is not part of the Pacific trade agreement , or any US trade deal .\nLawmakers and labor often point to jobs lost to a China trade deal . For example , Rep. Barbara Lee ( D ) of California recently said that communities of color have disproportionately suffered because of a \u201c US-China trade deal . \u201d\nYes , minorities have disproportionately suffered job losses over the years , but the way it 's described makes it sound like the losses come from America 's trade agreement with China . There is no US-China trade deal .\nRepresentative Lee is getting her data \u2013 35 percent of minority jobs lost to China along with a 30 percent drop in wages \u2013 from the Communications Workers of America . The union cites \u201c the China deal , \u201d but what it \u2019 s really referring to is China joining the World Trade Organization in 2001 .\nBeing in the WTO is not the same as entering into a negotiated free trade agreement , which could be potentially stricter , between two countries or even a dozen countries . Some argue that China should be part of the Pacific Rim deal or some future US free trade agreement because it \u2019 s too big to ignore .\nBut for now , the Obama administration is arguing that the Pacific agreement is needed as a geostrategic counterweight to China .\nGlobalization and free trade deals are not the same thing .\nWhen opponents of free trade agreements cite job losses , lower wages , or outsourcing , they often lump in the phenomenon of \u201c globalization \u201d with free trade agreements .\nGlobalization is what \u2019 s happening with the world economy and culture \u2013 the spread of interconnectedness hastened by the digital age . Its downside can mean Americans losing business to international retailers over the Internet , losing call centers to India ( with which the US has no trade agreement ) , or being undercut by Chinese currency manipulation .\nFree trade agreements try to bring structure to this free-wheeling world by setting up common standards . They , too , have downsides that result in job losses in some sectors , but the deals are an attempt to bring order to globalization .\n\u201c Globalization is an economic evolution . A trade agreement is just the opposite . It \u2019 s a construct , \u201d says Bell .\nThe secrecy surrounding the Pacific trade deal is not so unusual .\nIt \u2019 s true that members of Congress have to go to a special room to read the draft Pacific trade agreement ; that they must surrender their cell phones before going in ; that they can take notes \u2013 but not with them when they leave ; that they may not divulge its contents to outsiders , even experts who might help them better understand the contents .\nWhy the secrecy ? The administration says it \u2019 s to protect its negotiating power . How can it negotiate sensitive points with 11 countries while 535 members of Congress and the general public weigh in ? Besides , any member of Congress will be able to go to the trade negotiations or consult with the administration . And the final deal will be available to the public for 60 days before it \u2019 s voted on in Congress .\nDeal-making in secret is not an unusual negotiating strategy , supporters say .\n\u201c This is really not substantially different than how labor unions themselves negotiate their contracts , \u201d says Rep. Gregory Meeks ( D ) of New York , one of the president \u2019 s few Democratic trade supporters in the House . For example , top union officials negotiate contracts , and then take the results back to the members for ratification .\nOn Wednesday , the Senate approved fast track trading authority for the president .\nBut this was a vote about process , not a vote on a trade agreement . Fast track allows the president to negotiate a trade deal with the assurance that Congress can \u2019 t change it once he \u2019 s sealed the deal ; it can only approve or disapprove it .
