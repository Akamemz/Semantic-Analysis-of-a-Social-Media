Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul .\nRubio \u2019 s role as co-author of an immigration-law rewrite has cooled Hatfield and other Republicans on the Tea Party hero . A six-city , three-day tour across the state \u2019 s Panhandle this week for Rubio revealed an anxious base of supporters he \u2019 ll have to pacify before he can seek to win over primary voters in Iowa or New Hampshire in 2016 .\n\u201c It \u2019 s like he went out and committed adultery on us , \u201d said Hatfield , 62 , his short-sleeve plaid shirt tucked into blue jeans on a muggy summer day in Apalachicola . \u201c He \u2019 s got to earn our trust again . \u201d\nRubio , 42 , who \u2019 s said he \u2019 ll decide next year whether to run for president , fell from first to fifth in a poll of nine potential Republican candidates in Iowa , the state that holds the first contest every four years , according to Public Policy Polling surveys taken in February and July . Paul was first in the latest poll .\nHis drop followed passage of the Senate \u2019 s immigration bill on June 27 . He has seen a similar slip in New Hampshire , according to polls taken by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center . On Aug. 2 , his support among likely voters there dropped by half and he was fifth among 12 potential Republican candidates , after coming in second to New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in a February survey .\nRubio \u2019 s standing emphasizes a conundrum for his party : Many Republicans agree on the need to revamp U.S. immigration policy after their presidential candidate , Mitt Romney , won just 27 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2012 . As a result , reaching out to minority voters was a key recommendation of a Republican National Committee report after the election .\nStill , Republican lawmakers who back a path to citizenship for 11 million undocumented U.S. immigrants often risk a backlash among their supporters . South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham has drawn two 2014 primary opponents , in part because of his backing for the Senate bill .\nThe split has surfaced in the Capitol , where Republicans who control the U.S. House have rejected the Senate immigration bill and instead are taking a piecemeal approach . House lawmakers are preparing separate measures on the issue .\n\u201c Some people in Iowa really believe that Rubio would be unrecoverable if he chose to mount a campaign in 2016 \u201d for president , said Bob Vander Plaats , chief executive officer of The Family Leader , an Iowa-based coalition . \u201c He has severely damaged himself \u201d by backing immigration , said Vander Plaats , whose group backs Republican stances opposing abortion rights and gay marriage .\nRubio , dressed in a dark suit and tie for each event in Florida this week , has a life-of-the-party quality to him as he shakes hands and laughs while moving through an audience . In Panama City , he chatted with one man about high school football .

The Obama administration has already delayed a crucial part the law, giving businesses an extra year to provide their workers with insurance.\n\nStill, the issue has challenges for Rubio, who has vowed to vote against budget legislation that includes any funding for the health-care law.\n\n\u201cThrowing it away doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense,\u201d Santa Fe Health Care Chief Executive Officer Michael Gallagher said during Rubio\u2019s meeting with Gainesville Chamber of Commerce members. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of good elements in there.\u201d\n\nGallagher, whose Gainesville-based company sells health- coverage plans and runs a retirement community, questioned the wisdom of Rubio\u2019s tactic in a Democratic-controlled Senate and urged him to instead fix the law\u2019s specific issues.\n\nChris Nwasike, a 35-year-old wealth manager in Jacksonville and former Tea Party organizer, said Rubio\u2019s push to defund the health-care law could lead to a government shutdown and hurt the financial markets.\n\nDinner Heckler\n\nAt the Bay County Republican Party fundraising dinner, 72- year-old retiree Jim Bova heckled the senator as Rubio described defunding Obama\u2019s health-care law as a moral issue for the party.\n\n\u201cAs conservatives, what issue are we willing to draw a line in the sand on if it\u2019s not this one?\u201d Rubio said. \u201cNow look, if someone\u2019s got a better idea about how to stop Obamacare I\u2019m open to that. But I haven\u2019t heard one yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you guys come up with one on your own?\u201d Bova shouted.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d Rubio told him.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not trying very hard, not in four years,\u201d Bova shot back.",
