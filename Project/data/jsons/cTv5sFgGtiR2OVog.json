    "content": "The House is currently dozens of votes short of being able to pass legislation that would allow President Barack Obama to send trade deals to Congress for fast approval , according to senior lawmakers and aides in both parties , imperiling a top White House priority for the president \u2019 s final years in office .\nAt this point , upward of 75 House Republicans could vote against trade promotion authority if it comes up for a vote in the coming weeks , according to aides and lawmakers involved in the process . Some of the lawmakers fear job losses in their districts from free trade ; others distrust Obama and oppose giving him more power .\nHouse GOP leaders will begin officially canvassing for votes Friday , but they \u2019 ve been in private strategy sessions for weeks , learning about the intricacies of the bill from Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan ( R-Wis. ) .\nHouse Democrats , meanwhile , say just 12 to 20 of their lawmakers support Obama \u2019 s request . That figure , if it holds , would amount to a stinging rebuke of a president by his own party .\n\u201c It \u2019 s very low on the Democratic side , \u201d Rep. Jim Clyburn ( D-S.C. ) said , commenting on the support . House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer ( D-Md . ) said the 12-to-20 figure is \u201c probably pretty accurate \u201d but added the White House is keeping the count . The Senate is generally expected to pass the measure .\nThe fast-track legislation would allow Obama to submit trade agreements to Congress for straight up-or-down votes without amendments . Critics consider the procedure undemocratic , but proponents say other countries won \u2019 t make their best offers in trade talks with the United States if they know Congress could change the terms of the pact .\nObama needs the bill to complete the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership with Japan and 10 other countries . The pact would cover approximately 40 percent of world economic output , making it the biggest free trade agreement to date . Business groups are pushing hard for the trade bill and the Asia-Pacific agreement , but labor and many activist groups strongly oppose both .\nHouse Democrats are urging the White House to step its game up in shoring up support \u2014 and the administration appears to be kicking into high gear . Cabinet secretaries are starting to become engaged in lobbying Democrats . More than 30 pro-business lawmakers who are members of the moderate New Democrat Coalition will meet with Obama on Thursday at the White House . The Obama administration is also targeting Congressional Black Caucus members in hopes they will back his push .\nObama met last week with Clyburn , CBC Chairman G.K. Butterfield of North Carolina , and Reps. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas and Greg Meeks of New York about the trade measure . Clyburn said he \u2019 s still undecided .\n\u201c I am in constant consultation with the leadership , but I am not there yet , \u201d Clyburn said . Butterfield said he is leaning no because he was \u201c still tarnished by the trade deals of the 1990s . NAFTA and other trade deals . My district and me personally . \u201d\nButterfield said he will continue to research the topic , \u201c because I want to give the president and those proponents the benefit of the doubt. \u201d But Democratic support is \u201c lacking , \u201d he said .\nDemocrats who support TPA recognize the weak numbers and say administration officials are doing a lousy job wrangling support . They \u2019 re spending too much time on policyand no time on politics and casting too wide a net in search of elusive support .\n\u201c I \u2019 m sure there \u2019 s lots more that could be done , should \u2019 ve been done , should be done , will be done , but I think the \u2026 more-information phase is over , \u201d said Rep. Gerry Connolly ( D-Va. ) , a member of the moderate New Democrat Coalition , who is attending the White House meeting Thursday . \u201c This isn \u2019 t going to be decided on , \u2018 If you get more information you \u2019 ll see what I see. \u2019 And the sooner the White House takes cognizance of that , the better . \u201d\nThe trade fight is turning into a battle over \u201c raw numbers , \u201d Connolly added . \u201c What \u2019 s the universe we \u2019 ve got , and what \u2019 s the universe they \u2019 ve got . \u201d\nHowever , Connolly , who is generally supportive of the pact , added , \u201c This is President Barack Obama \u2019 s trade deal , and we shouldn \u2019 t allow Democrats to forget that . \u201d\nRepublican leadership , which has been supportive of Obama \u2019 s trade agenda , recognizes the deep distrust of the president in their ranks . And they \u2019 re now trying to publicly reflect the reality they see behind the scenes : There \u2019 s still a lot of work to be done .\n\u201c We \u2019 re still working through , \u201d House Majority Whip Steve Scalise ( R-La . ) said Wednesday . \u201c But this is going to be a bipartisan effort . And we want to see that equal push from the administration . \u201d\nFailing to pass TPA would be an enormous defeat for the major power centers in Washington \u2014 but especially for Obama , who has made this trade deal central to his second-term economic agenda . Speaker John Boehner ( R-Ohio ) is supportive of free trade and the TPA bill , which was shepherded by his close ally Ryan , and he is pushing for the legislation in closed meetings .\n\u201c Last week , the Ways and Means Committee advanced its bipartisan TPA bill , legislation that will help us achieve the best trade agreements for American workers and job creators , \u201d Boehner said during a Wednesday morning meeting , according to a source in the room . \u201c This is a key Republican economic priority , and I look forward to working with Paul and everyone in this room to pass this bill . \u201d\nBoehner has long made clear that Democrats would have to provide a significant number of votes to get the bill through the House . But Democratic leaders are actively working against Obama . House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( D-Calif. ) has already backed an alternative , and Hoyer has not committed to supporting TPA . Unions staunchly oppose fast-track authority for the president .\nOf course , it \u2019 s early , and the tide could change . Scalise \u2019 s whip count Friday afternoon is critical to charting a path forward . And if the measure passes the Senate with a big bipartisan majority , that could change the prospects in the House . Another encouraging sign for proponents is Sen. Ted Cruz ( R-Texas ) , whose support for the measure has helped quiet some outside conservative groups that tend to oppose congressional Republicans .\nBusiness groups are lobbying for the measure , and one veteran of previous trade fights said the current situation is similar to the massive effort required to win approval of trade promotion authority in 2002 and a free trade agreement with Central American countries in 2005 . Both passed the House with just a few votes to spare .\n\u201c It \u2019 s going to take time to solidify the numbers , \u201d said Linda Dempsey of the National Association of Manufacturers .\nCongressional leadership hasn \u2019 t yet decided whether the Senate or House will vote on the legislation first .\nThere isn \u2019 t much wiggle room . If Republicans can garner 200 votes \u2014 which many believe to be their ceiling for support \u2014 17 Democrats would need to vote with Obama to pass the bill . Many Democrats think that might be tough . If the Democratic count gets too low , the president \u2019 s party will find it easier to oppose him than back him . ? Dwindling GOP support could also imperil the bill .\n\u201c I can \u2019 t point to anything that ever sails through easy around here , \u201d said Rep. Pat Tiberi ( R-Ohio ) , a member of the Ways and Means Committee who is also a close ally of Boehner . \u201c Nothing \u2019 s easy . So we have to continue to educate members . \u201d\nBut the fault lines are dangerous for Republicans . The opposition stems from regional issues and ideological concerns . For example , reliable allies of GOP leadership like New Jersey Rep. Frank LoBiondo and Ohio Rep. David Joyce are unlikely to support the measure because of local union concerns , aides said . The South Carolina delegation , which closely coordinates on most votes , is mostly undecided .\n\u201c We \u2019 re doing what we always do with pieces of legislation , hearing one another out and discussing what \u2019 s best for the people we work for in our state , \u201d Rep. Trey Gowdy ( R-S.C. ) said . \u201c We have a very inclusive participatory delegation . \u201d\nBut the problem among some conservatives is plainly political and squarely springs from their mistrust of Obama . One Republican lawmaker , speaking without attribution , said he could vote for fast-track authority \u201c maybe under another president . \u201d\n\u201c I need to have questions answered about ceding more authority to the president , \u201d said House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz ( R-Utah ) , who said he hoped to vote for the bill when it comes up . Supporters , such as Rep . Rob Woodall ( R-Ga. ) , said Republicans need to explain that the bill doesn \u2019 t give the president new authority that he didn \u2019 t already have .\n\u201c Nobody wants to give this president anything . But that \u2019 s not what it is , of course ; it \u2019 s restricting the president , it \u2019 s incorporating the House \u2019 s opinion , \u201d he said . \u201c That \u2019 s the challenge back home . \u201d\nBut at this point , many staunch conservatives are squarely aligned with Chaffetz , and it \u2019 s an open question where the House Freedom Caucus \u2014 which is gaining power as a conservative bloc \u2014 will end up . Rep. Justin Amash ( R-Mich. ) , a member , said there are \u201c widespread concerns \u201d among conservatives , even those who have supported free trade in the past .\n\u201c I think there are concerns about the process , \u201d said Amash , who added he is not finished reviewing the bill . \u201c What kind of review rank-and-file members of Congress will have on trade deals and who gets to assert that the president is not complying with the objectives . \u201d\nRep.
