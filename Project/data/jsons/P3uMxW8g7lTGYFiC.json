    "content": "Yet the shorter than expected sentence handed to his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort is giving the President a few , rare crumbs of comfort as he faces down an expansive set of criminal , civil and congressional investigations into his presidency , campaign , business empire and personal life .\nThe Virginia judge who handed Manafort a 47-month sentence -- far below the federal guidelines for his crimes -- also gave Trump a propaganda tool for his fervent effort to discredit Mueller 's investigation when he pointed out that the conviction was for bank and tax fraud and not for colluding with Russia .\n`` I just want to tell you that his lawyer went out of his way actually to make a statement last night , no collusion , '' Trump told reporters Friday morning before departing for Alabama , adding , `` The judge , for whatever reason , I was very honored by it , also made the statement that this had nothing to do with collusion with Russia . ''\nIn fact , Judge T.S . Ellis only said that collusion was n't an issue for him to consider in the case . He did not assess whether it happened or not .\nNothing that happened Thursday lessened Trump 's potential legal or political exposure , or repudiated Mueller 's investigation , which has uncovered a pattern of lying by Trump acolytes about unexplained ties to Russia . It 's a measure of how grim the last few years have been for the President that the jailing of his former campaign chairman could be interpreted in any way as good news for his White House .\nAnd no one outside Mueller 's circle has any idea what his final report -- expected to be delivered to Attorney General William Barr soon -- will say about the President 's conduct .\nBut Thursday 's events did raise some political and legal questions about the ambition of Mueller 's prosecutors , their tactics when confronted by a skeptical judge and the credibility being placed in Cohen 's deeply damaging testimony against Trump last week .\nIn the win-loss calculation that has characterized Trump 's life , the President can extract some advantage from the surprising courtroom drama . Anything that be spun as a blow to the special counsel will be seized on in Trump 's conservative media echo chamber in the campaign to bolster the President 's standing among core GOP voters that is critical to his long-term viability .\nMueller 's team had asked for a 19-25 year jail term for a tax and finance fraud conviction arising from Manafort 's lavish lifestyle as a sharp suited uber-lobbyist who spun his dark arts for pro-Russia politicians in Ukraine .\nThat would have sent the 69-year-old Manafort to jail likely for the rest of his life . But the less than four-year term shocked many legal observers and sparked looks of astonishment among prosecutors in Ellis ' courtroom .\nThe judge 's leniency does not change the fact of Manafort 's conviction by a jury of his peers . A judge in Washington , who has been less well disposed toward Manafort , will sentence him next week in a separate case , in which he has been accused of lying to Mueller and breaching a plea deal .\nMost observers think he could be facing a decade behind bars in a sentence that could run concurrently or begin after the one handed down Thursday .\nWhatever happens next week , Ellis effectively handed Trump 's team a welcome talking point , when he pointed out Manafort was being sentenced for tax and bank fraud not colluding with Russia .\n`` The sentence was a lot less than the out of control Angry Democrat prosecutors wanted , '' said Trump 's lawyer Rudy Giuliani in a statement .\n`` They should be ashamed of their horrendous treatment of Paul Manafort who they pressured relentlessly because , unlike Michael Cohen , he would n't lie for them . ''\nManafort 's lawyer , Kevin Downing said outside court : `` I think what most importantly what you saw today is the same thing that we said from Day 1 .... `` There is absolutely no evidence that Paul Manafort was involved in any collusion with any government official from Russia . ''\nManafort 's lawyers had sought to show during the trial that their client was prosecuted more rigorously than another defendant might have been owing to his close links to the President -- an argument Ellis seemed to accept .\nJUST WATCHED Senator : Manafort sentence 'failed to do justice ' Replay More Videos ...

Richard Blumenthal , D-Connecticut , told CNN 's Erin Burnett on `` OutFront . ''\nFreshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez blasted Manafort 's sentencing as a prime example of sentencing disparities between high- and low-income defendants .\n`` Paul Manafort getting such little jail time for such serious crimes lays out for the world how it 's almost impossible for rich people to go to jail for the same amount of time as someone who is lower income , '' the New York Democrat tweeted . `` In our current broken system , 'justice ' is n't blind .
