Ka-ma-la ! \u201d Local police estimated that Harris drew a crowd larger than Barack Obama did when he announced his run for president in Illinois in 2007 .\nHarris spoke of her upbringing as a child of Indian and Jamaican parents in California , and she raised the mantle of her experience : her steady climb from career prosecutor to district attorney of San Francisco , to attorney general of California and becoming one of the state \u2019 s senators .\nShe promised to prosecute the case against Donald Trump and fight for the one client she has fought for her entire life : the people . In her hometown of Oakland , deep in the heart of the self-fashioned resistance state , her message hit its target .\n\u201c When she announced , it was life-changing , \u201d said Kasie Barnes , a lifelong Oakland resident and mother of four . \u201c I \u2019 ve always been familiar with her , I \u2019 ve always been proud of her successes , proud of her fight , proud of her voice .

She was a trailblazer : the first woman of color to be elected district attorney of San Francisco and attorney general of California . She stood for all the things that the man in the White House did not , and against all the things that he did .\nShe raised a jaw-dropping $ 1.5m in her first day .

And look how that turned out .\n\u201c In her 2010 campaign for attorney general , in the primary , I was told personally , by very influential electeds , that they did not think she could win , \u201d said Brian Brokaw , a Sacramento-based Democratic consultant who managed Harris \u2019 campaign during her 2010 run for California attorney general . \u201c She proved everybody wrong . \u201d\n\u201c She thrives when her back is against the wall , \u201d Brokaw added . \u201c It \u2019 s like fuel for her . \u201d\nThroughout the first six months of the campaign , Harris \u2019 supporters had maintained : wait for the debates .\nShe \u2019 ll take command of the stage in the same way she stole the spotlight while questioning Trump appointees , they promised . She \u2019 ll display that keep-them-on-their-toes moxie that kept everyone listening on their toes .\n\u201c When those debates come , she is going to kill it , \u201d her longtime friend Amelia Ashley-Ward said in May .\nAt the 27 June Democratic debate , Harris brought on the fire even before the first commercial break . The stage had devolved into a chaos of candidates shouting at each other when Harris entered the fray : \u201c America does not want to witness a food fight , they want to know how we \u2019 re going to put food on their table . \u201d\n\u201c She was prosecuting , \u201d Latterman said . \u201c Of course the line was preplanned , but it was very well-played because she was literally standing between two men yelling at each other , right over her face . \u201d\nAnd then Harris went for the jugular . \u201c As the only black person on this stage , I would like to speak on the issue of race , \u201d she said , before turning her attention to Biden .\n\u201c I do not believe you are a racist , \u201d she continued , and then took him to task for his relationship with segregationist senators and his record of not supporting desegregation bussing efforts that directly benefited children like Harris .\n\u201c There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools , and she was bussed to school every day , \u201d Harris said to Biden . \u201c That little girl was me . \u201d\nWithin hours of that line , her website was selling T-shirts with the face of \u201c that little girl \u201d splashed on the front .\nHarris \u2019 questions and interjections had been among her biggest strengths in her three years in the Senate . Her exchanges with the the supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh over the Russia investigation and abortion rights led to memes of her skeptical face circulating around social media . Video of the 1 May Senate judiciary committee hearing in which she flusters attorney general William Barr over the Mueller report has notched millions of views .\n\u201c Every time she has one of those judiciary committee moments , her social media and her donations spike , \u201d said Dan Schnur , a professor of political communications at UC Berkeley . \u201c She \u2019 s a very talented prosecutor , and a very tough questioner , and Democratic primary voters are going to cheer whenever they see someone beating up on a Trump appointee . \u201d\nThe context behind the cheers is clear : if this is what she can do to a Trump appointee , what could she do to Trump himself ? And , for many Democratic voters , kicking Donald Trump out of the White House is ultimately what the election is about .\n\u201c She is someone whose toughness can \u2019 t ever be questioned , \u201d Brokaw said . \u201c People who are supporting her know she would not shy away from a fight against Trump , and I think a lot of people are picturing the two of them on a debate stage together . \u201d\nAt a Harris town hall viewing party in Rancho Cordova , California , earlier this year , the question of which candidate was most likely to beat Trump was on everyone \u2019 s mind .\n\u201c She \u2019 s great in public hearings , \u201d said Etta , a retired singer and legal assistant who asked to be identified only by her first name , over iced tea and brownies . \u201c Trump will not be able to cut her in pieces . There \u2019 s no way . \u201d\nIn Oakland , the Harris town hall viewing parties fill to capacity within hours . But in the small , conservative town in central California , the five attendees , all but one of them of retirement age , were excited they had found other \u201c people who are interested in Kamala . \u201d\n\u201c She is unflappable when she \u2019 s speaking , \u201d added Barbara . \u201c That \u2019 s something that we really need . I always trust her that she \u2019 s going to say the right thing , she \u2019 s going to lay it out clearly , and not stumble on her words .\nThe question now is if the anticipation of a Trump v Harris showdown will be enough to ease some of the criticism and overcome some of the challenges the California senator has faced in recent months .\nShe has a natural constituency among women of color , a crucial constituent in the Democratic race to the White House , but she needs to get better at telling her personal story to those voters , said Aimee Allison , the founder of She the People . Her attack at the debate and the Essence Conference was a start \u2013 \u201c Talking about her own experiences was part of the most powerful part with her exchange with Biden , \u201d Allison said \u2013 but she must do more .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not just that because you \u2019 re a woman of color , you \u2019 re going to appeal . That \u2019 s not the case for Tulsi Gabbard , for example , \u201d Allison said . \u201c But if you \u2019 re a woman of color who can speak with vulnerability , authenticity and power , that will make you stand out . \u201d\nWho is running for president ? The full list of 2020 Democratic candidates Read more\nIn tapping into that vulnerability , however , her prosecutorial experience gets viewed through a different lens . In the age of Black Lives Matter and broadening support for criminal justice reform , someone who has worked within the system her entire career can \u2019 t exactly reinvent herself as someone now fighting against it . Harris describes herself as a \u201c progressive prosecutor \u201d , but has a track record endorsing policies now considered racist and ineffective as district attorney and attorney general . \u201c Kamala Harris is a cop , \u201d some of her critics on the left have argued , pointing at some of her decisions on issues including sex work , police reform , prosecutors \u2019 misconduct , prisoners \u2019 rights and truancy .\nJust last week , amid the celebrations over her debate performance , The Appeal , a not-for-profit media outlet focused on criminal justice reform , highlighted the wrongful conviction of Jamal Trulove under Harris \u2019 tenure as district attorney . San Francisco ultimately agreed to pay Trulove $ 13.1m after a federal civil jury found that the police had coerced a witness into identifying him as the suspect . Trulove , an actor who is gaining recognition following his role in the film The Last Black Man in San Francisco , tweeted , \u201c That Black man was me ! \u201d \u2013 a glib reference to one of Harris \u2019 one-liners in the debate .\n\u201c Every candidate \u2019 s record is going to be scrutinized in this race , \u201d her campaign adviser shrugged . \u201c This is not a walk in the park . This is the competition to be leader of the free world . Everybody \u2019 s record should be scrutinized . \u201d\nOthers have questioned Harris \u2019 hesitancy to clarify her position on more divisive policy questions in the first months of the campaign . After the CNN town hall in April , political pundits pilloried Harris for continually answering , \u201c I think we should have that conversation. \u201d They criticized her for taking too cautious a stance , for being too deliberate , too guarded .\nEven Etta , one of the women at the Rancho Cordova watch party , was quick to pipe in with a snarky aside . \u201c Oh , cop-out answer ! \u201d she hollered , when Harris punted .\nHarris faced a similar criticism last week , when her answers on whether she \u2019 d support federally-mandated bussing appeared to change . Her team later explained that it was a question of nuance , not yes or no \u2013 she supported the federally-mandated bussing that allowed \u201c that little girl \u201d to go to elementary school in 1970 , but understands that times are different now .\nShe came out on the technical side of right in this fight , but dinged nonetheless . She was scathed even more for her position on eliminating private health insurance , an issue she had already walked back but raised her hand in favor of during the debate . She later had to clarify that she misinterpreted the question .\n\u201c Where is she politically ? , \u201d asked Latterman , the San Francisco-based political consultant . \u201c She seems to be moving to the left . More exposure is going to expose more of what her politics are , and I think to some extent , she \u2019 s still trying to figure that out on a national level . \u201d\nKirsten Gillibrand : can the # MeToo senator become Madam President ? Read more\n\u201c She is not one to make rash or hasty decisions , \u201d conceded Brokaw , her former campaign manager . He sees that as working in her favor , however . \u201c Voters , having been through almost [ three ] years of a president who is beyond reckless , are looking for someone who is both bold and deliberate in her way of acting and thinking , \u201d he said .\nHarris \u2019 supporters in San Francisco argue that given the chance , she will beat Trump .\nAfter all , this is the woman who faced off with an incumbent district attorney from a storied San Francisco family , and won . This is the woman who remained steadfast for three weeks after the 2010 attorney general election while the state tallied up mail-in and provisional ballots , and won by a margin of 50,000 votes .\n\u201c I was for her from the very beginning and I will continue to support her because I know that her heart is right , \u201d Ashley-Ward said . \u201c People are drawn to her . When they see her on TV , taking on these powerful men who think they can do anything , say anything and get away with anything , people are impressed with that because I think 98 % of Americans wouldn \u2019 t take on these guys . She \u2019 s not afraid . \u201d",

Trulove, an actor who is gaining recognition following his role in the film The Last Black Man in San Francisco, tweeted, \u201cThat Black man was me!\u201d \u2013 a glib reference to one of Harris\u2019 one-liners in the debate.\n\n\u201cEvery candidate\u2019s record is going to be scrutinized in this race,\u201d her campaign adviser shrugged. \u201cThis is not a walk in the park. This is the competition to be leader of the free world. Everybody\u2019s record should be scrutinized.\u201d\n\nOthers have questioned Harris\u2019 hesitancy to clarify her position on more divisive policy questions in the first months of the campaign. After the CNN town hall in April, political pundits pilloried Harris for continually answering, \u201cI think we should have that conversation.\u201d They criticized her for taking too cautious a stance, for being too deliberate, too guarded.\n\nEven Etta, one of the women at the Rancho Cordova watch party, was quick to pipe in with a snarky aside. \u201cOh, cop-out answer!\u201d she hollered, when Harris punted.\n\nHarris faced a similar criticism last week, when her answers on whether she\u2019d support federally-mandated bussing appeared to change. Her team later explained that it was a question of nuance, not yes or no \u2013 she supported the federally-mandated bussing that allowed \u201cthat little girl\u201d to go to elementary school in 1970, but understands that times are different now.\n\nShe came out on the technical side of right in this fight, but dinged nonetheless. She was scathed even more for her position on eliminating private health insurance, an issue she had already walked back but raised her hand in favor of during the debate. She later had to clarify that she misinterpreted the question.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Civil rights leader Al Sharpton escorts Kamala Harris past media and well wishers as they arrive at Sylvia\u2019s Restaurant in the Harlem neighborhood of New York, 21 February 2019.

More exposure is going to expose more of what her politics are, and I think to some extent, she\u2019s still trying to figure that out on a national level.\u201d\n\nKirsten Gillibrand: can the #MeToo senator become Madam President?

He sees that as working in her favor, however. \u201cVoters, having been through almost [three] years of a president who is beyond reckless, are looking for someone who is both bold and deliberate in her way of acting and thinking,\u201d he said.\n\nHarris\u2019 supporters in San Francisco argue that given the chance, she will beat Trump.\n\nAfter all, this is the woman who faced off with an incumbent district attorney from a storied San Francisco family, and won. This is the woman who remained steadfast for three weeks after the 2010 attorney general election while the state tallied up mail-in and provisional ballots, and won by a margin of 50,000 votes.\n\n\u201cI was for her from the very beginning and I will continue to support her because I know that her heart is right,\u201d Ashley-Ward said. \u201cPeople are drawn to her. When they see her on TV, taking on these powerful men who think they can do anything, say anything and get away with anything, people are impressed with that because I think 98% of Americans wouldn\u2019t take on these guys. She\u2019s not afraid.\u201d",
