But we \u2019 re going to hold him to his word . \u201d\nThe president delivered the remarks at the same community college where Bill Clinton gave a campaign speech in 2010 and urged voters to give Democrats two more years to fix the nation \u2019 s economy .\n\u201c The Democrats are saying something like this : \u2018 We found a big hole that we did not dig . We didn \u2019 t get it filled in 21 months , but at least we quit digging , \u2019 \u201d Mr. Clinton said at the time . \u201d \u2018 Give us two more years .
