Why would anyone within Trump 's upper echelon leak this detail and intentionally draw blood from their just-announced teammate ? And who would be in a position to know this information , but also have an incentive to run off and gossip to CNN that Trump supposedly came thisclose to dropping Pence and heading in another direction ? Here 's Bash 's tweet , which is making the rounds :\nScoop : @ realDonaldTrump was so unsure about @ mike_pence that around midnight last night he asked top aides if he could get out of it \u2014 Dana Bash ( @ DanaBashCNN ) July 15 , 2016\nBaseless speculation : Perhaps this was the work of someone plugged into Trumpworld , but whose loyalties lie with one of the other spurned VP finalists .

Others ' grapes are more distinctly sour :\nChristie discussing Pence on MSNBC : `` You 'd have to ask him why he endorsed Ted Cruz at the time that he did . I do n't know . '' \u2014 Alan Rappeport ( @ arappeport ) July 14 , 2016\nSources tell NBC News that Donald Trump was watching news coverage from his Beverly Hills home Thursday and was described as surprised and `` irritated '' that news organizations were identifying Pence as his choice early in the day . Those sources said that by mid-afternoon , after the initial news reports , he had still `` not informed '' the other two men on his final list -former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie -- that a final decision had been reached . Trump spoke to Gov . Christie after 4:00pm in what was described as a `` tense '' conversation where a Pence pick was discussed but a final decision was not communicated .\nRegardless of how the network Trump loves to berate came to possess this nugget , its provenance and the motives behind it should be met with some skepticism . Meanwhile , conservatives are mostly applauding the addition to Pence to the ticket ; he 's being hailed as a strong fiscal conservative and a pro-life champion who fought against government bailouts before it was popular . The acclaim is not universal , however . Some fiscal hawks are reminding people of the Indiana governor 's decision to expand Medicaid under Obamacare in his state , for which the White House praised him this week . And a sizable contingent of social conservatives , including this high-profile Trump backer , do n't appear to have gotten over what they see as Pence 's betrayal on last year 's hysterical uproar over a religious freedom law .

What 's striking about this clip is that it highlights three issues : The RFRA controversy , Planned Parenthood , and immigration . From watching the video , you 'd never know that Pence reversed course and insisted upon changes to the religious liberty bill he 'd signed , which closely mirrored a federal law passed almost unanimously by Congress and signed by President Clinton in the 1990 's .
