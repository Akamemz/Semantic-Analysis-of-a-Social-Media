In which there was a specific recounting of the Democratic Party \u2019 s construction as the Party of Race . A party that was built on the idea of racism .\nAmong the hard facts of party history cited were these :\nTwenty Democratic Party platforms from 1868-1948 that either supported segregation outright or were silent on the subject .\nThe use of the Ku Klux Klan , which , according to Columbia University historian Eric Foner , became \u201c a military force serving the interests of the Democratic Party. \u201d University of North Carolina historian Allen Trelease described the Klan as the \u201c terrorist arm of the Democratic Party . \u201d\nThe Democratic Party opposed the 13th , 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution . The 13th banned slavery . The 14th effectively overturned the infamous 1857 Dred Scott decision ( made by Democratic pro-slavery Supreme Court justices ) by guaranteeing due process and equal protection to former slaves . The 15th gave black Americans the right to vote .\nAnd so it went as the Democratic Party built itself politically on a culture of racism that is now once again overflowing in this sudden drive of 21st century leftists to deny the original identity politics that created them \u2014 and which is still the nuclear core of their ideological energy .\nAll of which raises the obvious question . If the statues birthed by Democratic Party orthodoxy must come down \u2014 and there is now a call to remove statues of prominent Democratic members of the House or Senate from the US Capitol building \u2014 should the political party that gave birth to those statues in the first place be the exception to the First Amendment \u2014 and banned and outlawed outright ?\nMy answer ? Of course not . The First Amendment should protect even a party built by racism and racists .

Then at the very least the party must be held accountable for its legacy .\nWhat does that mean at its logical conclusion ? Should President Franklin Roosevelt \u2019 s statue on the Washington Mall be ripped out ? FDR was the president who embodied the Democratic Party in the 1930s and 1940s and well beyond after his death . He was also the president who appointed Ku Klux Klansman and Alabama Senator Hugo Black to the Supreme Court .

The rumors and statements to the contrary are wrong .\nJustice Black would later go on to author Korematsu v. United States \u2014 the infamous Supreme Court decision that imprisoned Japanese-Americans in internment camps . Will FDR \u2019 s Hyde Park home and presidential library now be burned to the ground ?\nOr perhaps the focus should be on demolishing the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington ?
