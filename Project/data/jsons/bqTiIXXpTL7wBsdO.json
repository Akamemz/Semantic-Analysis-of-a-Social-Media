    "content": "Hillary Rodham Clinton admitted in a news conference Tuesday that it was a mistake to use a personal email account to conduct State Department business , but denied any wrongdoing even as she acknowledged that she no longer has thousands of emails she deemed private .\n\u201c It would have been better had I used a second email account , \u201d Clinton said , saying she had decided in 2008 before becoming secretary of state to use only one account \u201c for convenience. \u201d \u201c Looking back , it would have been smarter to use two devices , \u201d she said , insisting that she had sent all \u201c work-related \u201d emails to the State Department and hailing the department \u2019 s decision , announced Tuesday , to make them available online .\nAt the same time , Clinton said she believed she had complied with State Department rules at the time and had not been under any obligation to use an official government email account .\n\u201c I believe I have met all of my responsibilities . The server will remain private , \u201d Clinton said .\nBut Clinton vociferously defended her decision not to share personal details of her life , such as wedding planning , yoga lessons and decisions about her mother \u2019 s funeral . \u201c In the end , I decided not to keep my private emails , \u201d Clinton said .\nAsked whether she had been briefed on security concerns about her email setup , Clinton refused to answer directly , but volunteered that she had sent no classified emails and that there had been no security breeches of her private server .\nThroughout the brief question-and-answer session at the United Nations headquarters in Manhattan , Clinton repeatedly deflected another key question asked by several reporters : Just how , and in what way , might this episode affect her plans to run for president in 2016 .\nClinton was responding to reports last week that she relied exclusively on a private email address during her four years as secretary of state , rather than an official account where the messages would likely have become part of her agency \u2019 s historical records . The Associated Press later reported that the emails were channeled through a private server registered to her suburban New York residence , to channel her messages .\nMeanwhile , the White House acknowledged Monday that President Barack Obama traded emails with Clinton on her private account but was said he unaware how the account was set up or that messages were not being saved in a federal archive .\n\u201c The president , as I think many people expected , did over the course of his first several years in office trade emails with his secretary of state , \u201d said press secretary Josh Earnest . \u201c I would not describe the number of emails as large , but they did have the occasion to email each other . \u201d\nObama told CBS in an interview Saturday that he \u2019 d learned of Clinton \u2019 s use of a private e-mail address and server \u201c through news reports. \u201d However , Earnest conceded Monday that Obama knew Clinton was communicating from a private e-mail account , but was unaware of how that mail was handled or that Clinton did not have an official \u201c state.gov \u201d account .\n\u201c Yes , the president was aware of her email address , \u201d Earnest said . \u201c He was not aware of the details of how that email address and that server had been set up or how Secretary Clinton and her team were planning to comply with the Federal Records Act . \u201d\nThe pressure on Clinton has ratcheted up as critics , including some congressional Democrats , have called on her to publicly address the reports .\nIn December , Clinton sent 50,000 pages of emails from the private account to the State Department at its request . The agency recently turned over 900 pages of emails from Clinton \u2019 s account to a House committee investigating the Benghazi attacks in 2012 .\nBut critics have argued that Clinton \u2019 s handling of the issue as left her and her staff totally in control of screening emails and deciding which ones are responsive to government requests .\nBoth the White House and the State Department brushed aside suggestions from that panel \u2019 s chairman , Rep. Trey Gowdy ( R-S.C. ) , that his panel may not have received all Libya-related emails . Gowdy said Clinton produced no emails from a time period when she traveled to Libya and was photographed using her BlackBerry .\n\u201c Maybe she was using her BlackBerry to read the news , \u201d Earnest said . \u201c You can use your Blackberry for other things other than email , right ? \u201d\nState spokeswoman Jen Psaki took a similar tack , arguing that there was nothing suspicious about any gaps in the e-mail record .\n\u201c I wasn \u2019 t on that trip [ but ] I \u2019 ve been on trips with the current secretary where there are communications issues , where you really don \u2019 t send emails , \u201d the spokeswoman said .\nEarnest also said the White House had allowed the State Department to manage its own response to the latest House Benghazi inquiry .\n\u201c I would hazard a guess that if the White House were intimately involved in that kind of effort to review email and make determinations about what should be provided to Congress that [ Gowdy would ] be complaining about that on national television as well , \u201d the press secretary added .\nThe White House suggested Monday that concerns were misplaced about the process Clinton used to produce her emails after the State Department requested them in October .\nBut Earnest did not come down squarely for or against proposals that a neutral party verify that all work-related e-mails have been produced . Clinton allies suggested Sunday that she would be open to such a review .\n\u201c I haven \u2019 t heard anybody or seen anybody present any evidence to indicate that [ Clinton \u2019 s aides ] didn \u2019 t do what they said they did , \u201d Earnest declared . \u201c If Secretary Clinton \u2019 s team decides that they want to go to greater lengths than they already have that ultimately is a decision for them to make . \u201d\nThe fact that Obama corresponded with Clinton via a private server stoked fears that the arrangement increased the risks that either of them could have been hacked or that messages between them could have been intercepted more readily than communications between two \u201c .gov \u201d email accounts .\nHowever , cybersecurity experts said that was not necessarily the case , since communications between government e-mail servers handling unclassified information are not always encrypted or directly connected .\n\u201c There is no top-level , [ Office of Management and Budget ] -driven , thou-shalt-run a common-network-with-a-common-backbone , which is what we were trying to get years ago , but could just never do it , \u201d said one expert who worked on cybersecurity issues in the George W. Bush White House and asked not to be named . E-mails \u201c could go directly from one to another , but that depends on those two [ agencies \u2019 technology leaders \u2019 ] getting together and engineering some kind of cross-connect . \u201d\nThe former official said that proposals over the last decade to create a government-only network went by the wayside .\n\u201c The grand idea of connecting the entire federal government on fiber that \u2019 s only for the government \u2013 that \u2019 s about as practical as building a highway system that \u2019 s just for the government . Way too expensive to install , maintain and operate . So then you fall back on , okay , we \u2019 ll use commercial fiber , \u201d the official said .\nThe White House declined to comment Monday on whether Obama \u2019 s communication with Clinton through her private address posed any security risks or if those risks had been mitigated in some fashion .\n\u201c One of the security precautions we take around the president \u2019 s email is we don \u2019 t talk about it very [ much ] publicly , \u201d Earnest said , while acknowledging that policy had been breached somewhat in recent days .\nAt the State Department , Psaki said there was no indication that the content of Clinton \u2019 s e-mail account was compromised , although she changed her address in 2011 after a hacker obtained it and posted it online .\n\u201d We don \u2019 t have any reason to believe that \u201d outsiders gained access to her account , \u201d the spokeswoman said . \u201c Obviously her email wasn \u2019 t hacked . \u201d\nClinton \u2019 s expected effort to tackle questions at a press conference about her e-mail use poses risks for the former secretary , who is expected to officially announce her 2016 campaign for the White House in the next month or so . For one , she is out of practice \u2014 and hasn \u2019 t interacted much with the press since she left the State Department in 2013 .\nOne person close to the Clintons told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that whatever she says \u201c you guys are going to just say it raises more questions than it answers \u201d \u2014 but the person added , \u201c it \u2019 s something she needs to do . \u201d\nOn March 4 , Clinton announced on Twitter that she would turn over emails to the State Department for vetting and eventual public release . \u201c I want the public to see my email .
