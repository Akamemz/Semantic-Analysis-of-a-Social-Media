    "content": "Did the FBI verify the Trump dossier ? It \u2019 s a question that then-Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe refused to answer . The dossier is the piece of political opposition research compiled by former MI6 spook Christopher Steele that the Clinton campaign and the Democrats bankrolled . The intention was to find dirt on Trump . It was reportedly used as credible evidence to secure a FISA spy warrant on Carter Page , who briefly served as a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign . This FISA warrant was renewed at least three times from 2016 up until 2017 . Was it verified ? Given these glaring errors in the document itself , probably not . In fact , these errors could easily have been debunked by a simple Google search . First , let 's go to why this whole affair\u2014Spygate\u2014just got worse for the FBI/DOJ . Well , there \u2019 s a new actor involved now , the State Department , because officials there seem to have known that the Trump dossier was a biased document compiled for political purposes days before the FISA warrant was issued for Page . Steele was quite adamant that the contents of this document had to be known prior to Election Day 2016 in order the race . John Solomon at The Hill has more :\nDeputy Assistant Secretary of State Kathleen Kavalec \u2019 s written account of her Oct. 11 , 2016 , meeting with FBI informant Christopher Steele shows the Hillary Clinton campaign-funded British intelligence operative admitted that his research was political and facing an Election Day deadline . And that confession occurred 10 days before the FBI used Steele \u2019 s now-discredited dossier to justify securing a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA warrant to surveil former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page and the campaign \u2019 s ties to Russia .

Huber , which pretty much shows that it \u2019 s a safe bet that no verification process was taken at the FBI . Some of the sources in the dossier claim there was a Russian consulate in Miami , which served as a base for hacking operations . At the time , there was no Russian consulate in Miami . It was in Tampa and in the same building as the Commerce Department . This source also said the infamous pee tapes with Trump and escorts existed . They don \u2019 t .\nThe point is , which this thread makes clear , is that the FBI should \u2019 ve known this document \u2019 s authenticity was suspect when this source cited areas where Russian interests were being carried out that didn \u2019 t exist .
