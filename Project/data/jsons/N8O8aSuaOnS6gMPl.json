    "content": "Lena Dunham recently sparked an online frenzy by tweeting about something that doesn \u2019 t seem particularly controversial : birth control . Her tweet \u201c I need birth control because I have endometriosis and it helps manage pain . Why do you ? \u201d went viral . And at first I couldn \u2019 t figure out why .\nHaven \u2019 t we all known since the contraception mandate debate began that there are a \u201c few \u201d women who \u201c occasionally \u201d use contraception for reasons other than delaying , or avoiding , motherhood ? Sandra Fluke , for instance , name-checked some of these women during the congressional testimony that turned her into a conservative target and then a feminist rock star .\nBut conversations with friends following Dunham \u2019 s twitter-confession helped me realize why the tweet struck a chord : Many women use birth control for reasons other than pregnancy , and we just haven \u2019 t heard from them much because those reasons are usually embarrassing . As a result , women rarely discuss other reasons for using birth control among themselves , let alone boyfriends or husbands , and certainly not in public political discourse .\nIn the years since the contraception debate first exploded , the media narrative has remained largely the same : Women rely on birth control to prevent pregnancy , and a handful of women who have more exotic health woes need contraception for something else . They are rarities , so the thinking goes , and if they really and truly need birth control for health reasons they will find some way to get it covered , regardless of how religious their employers are .\nHowever , after chatting with a few friends who , like me , had relied on birth control at one time or another for reasons beyond pregnancy prevention , I decided to email 10 other women and ask the awkward question : Have any of you taken birth control for reasons that had nothing to do with preventing pregnancy ? Only two women wrote back to say pregnancy prevention was the primary reason they had used birth control throughout their lives . The eight others wrote back with stories about a variety of health conditions that caused them to take some form of contraception .\nOne Texas based woman said her menstrual flow was so heavy as a young woman her doctor prescribed birth control so she would not become anemic . A woman named Deborah wrote back and said she is currently using an IUD , one of the forms of birth control at the heart of the Hobby Lobby dispute , for the same reason . ( An ob-gyn quoted by The New York Times in 2008 cited IUDs as one of the best methods for treating heavy menstrual bleeding . )\nThree women said they had severe acne and the doctors tried birth control pills as a last resort . Another woman said she is currently using it to battle polycystic ovaries . Others mentioned severe premenstrual symptoms\u2014the kind that can \u2019 t be cured by popping a Tylenol .\nWhile 10 women do not constitute a comprehensive survey , the responses are striking nonetheless . Furthermore , a 2011 analysis by the nonprofit Guttmacher Institute found that 14 percent of women use contraception exclusively for something other than pregnancy prevention . In fact , many of these women have never had sexual intercourse .\nAnd the same data found that only 42 percent of respondents use the pill exclusively for pregnancy prevention , meaning that for nearly 60 percent of women , preventing pregnancy is only one reason they take contraception . Making this number more noteworthy is that some of the contraceptive-using women I emailed made a point to note that they are not currently sexually active .\nWhy does that matter ? Because , in a study , they may technically fall into the category of someone who has used contraception for pregnancy prevention and other reasons , even though right now the reasons they take birth control have nothing to do with pregnancy prevention .\nAnd there are a host of other reasons women take birth control that have come up in previous conversations I \u2019 ve had , but would be unlikely to emerge in an article on public policy . For instance , some women use it not only to curb premenstrual symptoms , but also to control when they menstruate . So if a woman has a job that will be particularly demanding and require more physical exertion during a certain time of the month , she can use her birth control pills to ensure that she doesn \u2019 t get her period at a moment when it could really inhibit her performance . That not only benefits her , but her employer as well .\nRolling your eyes ? Then consider this . In 2013 , Taiwan passed an amendment to its Gender Equality Act allotting women three paid days of menstrual leave each year . Which seems like a better economic move for employers : Having women miss work because of preventable symptoms , or covering medication that can alleviate the symptoms ?\nBut even raising the role of birth control in treating menstrual symptoms publicly can be politically fraught for some women . After all , there are already thousands of jokes out there about women and PMS . And there is already the perception among some men that , if we need meds to help us function once a month because of mother nature , then we really are the weaker sex .\nThis may be one reason that some of the women I reached out to , some of whom are in media , have never mentioned their own non-pregnancy-related birth control needs on the record\u2014even when they have addressed the topic publicly . Only two women I talked to , in fact , were comfortable with me using their names in this piece .\nWhile women may not want to have a candid conversation about pregnancy prevention with a boss , even fewer want to have a candid conversation about menstruating , or endometriosis or acne for that matter .
