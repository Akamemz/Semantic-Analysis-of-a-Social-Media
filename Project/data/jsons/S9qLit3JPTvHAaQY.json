    "content": "President Trump fended off criticism Monday that he is going soft on China \u2019 s unfair trade practice after he moved to cancel sanctions against a cheating Chinese company out of concern for its workers , action that prompted Democrats to mock the president for trying to \u201c make China great again . \u201d\nThe president made the startling reversal on ZTE Corp. , China \u2019 s second-largest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment , as U.S. and Chinese negotiators prepared to meet Tuesday in Washington for a second round of trade talks .\nAfter Mr. Trump said he wants to help ZTE \u201c get back into business , fast , \u201d Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said he would explore quickly \u201c alternative remedies \u201d to a seven-year ban against the company for trade violations .\nSen. Marco Rubio , Florida Republican , said the problem with ZTE \u201c isn \u2019 t jobs & trade , it \u2019 s national security & espionage . \u201d\n\u201c Any telecomm firm in # China can be forced to act as tool of Chinese espionage without any court order or any other review process . We are crazy to allow them to operate in U.S. without tighter restrictions , \u201d Mr. Rubio tweeted .\nU.S. intelligence officials told Congress this year that Americans should avoid products by ZTE and its Chinese rival Huawei because of cybersecurity concerns . The Pentagon two weeks ago banned the sale of both companies \u2019 phones on U.S. military bases , saying they \u201c may pose an unacceptable risk to Department \u2019 s personnel , information and mission . \u201d\nSEE ALSO : Rep. Adam Schiff : Chinese deal linked to Trump properties violates emoluments clause\nMr. Ross said the administration \u2019 s ban on U.S. firms selling their products to ZTE , which shipped goods illegally to Iran and North Korea , \u201c essentially caused them to cease operations . \u201d\n\u201c It also wouldn \u2019 t surprise me that they would bring up the ZTE [ in trade talks ] , but our position has been that that \u2019 s an enforcement action separate from trade , \u201d he said at the National Press Club .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s tweet that the U.S. ban on ZTE had caused \u201c too many jobs in China lost \u201d prompted a wave of criticism from lawmakers and U.S. business and labor groups accusing him of backing off a campaign promise to get tough with Beijing . Several lawmakers said Mr. Trump was sending the wrong signal on Chinese espionage .\n\u201c One of the few areas where the president and I agreed , and I was vocally supportive , was his approach towards China , \u201d said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer , New York Democrat . \u201c But even here he is backing off , and his policy is now designed to achieve one goal : make China great again . \u201d\nScott Paul , president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing , called Mr. Trump \u2019 s comments about lost Chinese jobs \u201c alarming \u201d and \u201c indefensible . \u201d\n\u201c In the middle of a trade dispute , the president is publicly offering a major concession to China that could potentially harm national security , \u201d Mr. Paul said . \u201c This is a company that has broken trade embargoes with Iran and North Korea and generated legitimate security concerns . Meanwhile , Beijing has yet to agree to end any unfair trade practice or make any meaningful reform . \u201d\nLate Monday , the president appeared to address the criticism by tweeting that ZTE \u201c buys a big percentage of individual parts from U.S. companies . \u201d\n\u201c This is also reflective of the larger trade deal we are negotiating with China and my personal relationship with [ Chinese ] President Xi , \u201d Mr. Trump said . ZTE reportedly purchased about $ 2 billion worth of parts last year from U.S. suppliers .\nThe White House said Chinese leaders have been pushing administration officials to ease up on the punishment for ZTE .\n\u201c This is part of a very complex relationship between the United States and China that involves economic issues , national security issues , \u201d said White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah . \u201c It \u2019 s an issue of high concern for China that \u2019 s been raised with the U.S. government and with our administration at various levels . \u201d\nHe said Mr. Trump asked the commerce secretary \u201c to look into it , consistent with applicable laws and regulations . \u201d\nWhen Mr. Ross announced the sanctions against ZTE last month , he called the company \u2019 s actions \u201c egregious \u201d and said officials had misled the U.S. about punishing employees responsible for the illegal sales to Iran and North Korea . ZTE earlier paid $ 1.19 billion in penalties for its actions .\nDuring the 2016 campaign , Mr. Trump repeatedly vowed to get tough with China \u2019 s unfair trade practices and to label Beijing as a currency manipulator .
