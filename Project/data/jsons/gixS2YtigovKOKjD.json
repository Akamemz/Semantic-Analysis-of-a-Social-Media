They \u2019 d unstop the dam of dysfunction and get stuff done .\nWith the new year about to begin , the verdict is in : 2015 was one of the most productive years on Capitol Hill since divided government set in five years ago .

Much credit goes to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell ( R ) of Kentucky for opening up the legislative process \u2013 and to Democrats for taking part as a cooperative minority , Mr. Grumet says .\nAmericans may not yet have noticed . In December , they gave Congress an abysmally low approval rating of 13 percent , according to Gallup .
