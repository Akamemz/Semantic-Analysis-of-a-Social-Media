    "content_original": "Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Friday that his country\u2019s deputy prime minister, Taro Aso, and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence have begun to \u201ccreate a new framework for a dialogue.\u201d\n\nWASHINGTON\u2014Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Friday that his country\u2019s deputy prime minister, Taro Aso, and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence have begun to \u201ccreate a new framework for a dialogue,\u201d suggesting that Tokyo has agreed to follow U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s call for more bilateral deals.\n\nMr. Abe\u2019s comments came in response to a question at a press conference about whether it was a mistake for Mr. Trump to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement. Mr. Abe was careful not to criticize Mr. Trump\u2019s decision\u2014he was standing next to the U.S. leader during the press conference\u2014and he said the U.S. and Japan were going to have meetings and discussions in the next few days about how to further boost cooperation.\n\nMr. Abe said that even though the U.S. had withdrawn from TPP, Japan remained committed to the goal of a \u201cfree trade regime in the region.\u201d The two leaders agreed that the economic dialogue between their deputies, Messrs. Pence and Aso, will cover three broad areas: coordinating fiscal and monetary policies; infrastructure investments, energy issues and cybersecurity; and bilateral trade, according to a senior official in a briefing with reporters. He added that there was no specific request from Mr. Trump. to initiate talks on a new bilateral trade agreement as part of the dialogue, following the U.S. withdrawal from the TPP. While Mr. Abe had long pushed for the completion of the regional trade agreement, he had hinted in recent weeks that Tokyo could be open to discussing a bilateral pact with the U.S. if requested by the Trump administration, a move that would face considerable domestic opposition in Japan. Highlighting Japan\u2019s willingness to take part in Mr. Trump\u2019s plans to invest heavily in U.S. infrastructure, Mr. Abe touched on high-speed railway projects being studied in some U.S. cities using Japanese technology. A train that runs on Japan\u2019s magnetic levitation, or maglev, system could travel between Washington and New York in about an hour, Mr. Abe told Mr. Trump, according to the Japanese official. Tokyo has funded an ongoing early-stage study to build the first leg of such a railway system between Washington and Baltimore.
