    "content": "In January , 2012 , Jair Bolsonaro , who was then a retired military officer and colorful but not politically relevant far-right congressman , was caught fishing illegally in a federally protected marine-wildlife reserve . Bolsonaro\u2014wearing a white , Speedo-like bathing suit\u2014was discovered in a small , inflatable boat inside the Tamoios Ecological Station , an area with a half-mile radius that serves as a refuge for penguins , seals , whales , and dolphins in the state of Rio de Janeiro . An agent with the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources ( IBAMA ) issued Bolsonaro a ticket for ten thousand reais , or roughly twenty-five hundred dollars . The following year , Bolsonaro introduced a bill in the legislature that would have barred guards with IBAMA and other environmental agencies from carrying guns , although he was otherwise a longtime defender of gun-ownership rights in Brazil . Later that year , Bolsonaro filed to get legal permission for him\u2014and him alone\u2014to fish in the Tamoios reserve . Ultimately , the fine was dismissed , the bill went nowhere in congress , and the courts decided it would be a bad idea to grant one lawmaker special permission to fish in a sanctuary .\nLast year , Bolsonaro was elected the President of Brazil , after running a nationalistic campaign that echoed , in many ways , the politics of Donald Trump . A climate-change skeptic , Bolsonaro argued that more land in the Amazon rainforest should be opened for farming , mining , and logging . Under his leadership , IBAMA \u2019 s budget has been cut by twenty-four per cent . Bolsonaro has also repeatedly threatened to transform the Tamoios reserve into a Brazilian Canc\u00fan , brimming with tourist hotels . The agent who wrote him the ticket for illegal fishing , back in 2012 , was fired from a senior government position . And Bolsonaro has installed opponents of environmental regulations in offices throughout his new administration .\nThis week , Bolsonaro \u2019 s disdain for environmental-protection measures attracted global attention when he initially rejected an offer of twenty million dollars in international aid to help fight forest fires burning in the Amazon . The proposed funding was one of the few concrete achievements to come out of the annual G-7 summit of the world \u2019 s largest democracies . The French President , Emmanuel Macron , who hosted the meeting in the resort town of Biarritz , insisted that countering the fires should be a top priority . At first , Bolsonaro rejected the aid offer , citing an ongoing feud with Macron in which the two leaders have exchanged insults .
