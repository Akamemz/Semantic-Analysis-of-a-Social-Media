    "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014The Supreme Court will hear three cases concerning whether gay and transgender people are protected from discrimination on the job , marking the first major LGBT rights issue to reach the court since its 2015 opinion legalizing same-sex marriage .\nLower courts have differed sharply on whether the 1964 Civil Rights Act , which prohibits sex discrimination , necessarily covers sexual orientation or gender identity . Congress , unlike some two dozen states , hasn \u2019 t explicitly added those classifications to federal antidiscrimination laws .\nThe court \u2019 s calendar all but ensures decisions will come in the late spring or early summer of 2020 , injecting a significant social issue\u2014and likely the makeup of the Supreme Court itself\u2014into the presidential election season .\nWith four liberal justices expected to read LGBT-rights claims more broadly , the focus will be on the court \u2019 s conservative wing , recently bolstered by two Trump appointees vetted by the president \u2019 s social-conservative allies .\nThat places the spotlight squarely on Justice Brett Kavanaugh , whose predecessor , Justice Anthony Kennedy , led a closely divided court through a series of landmark opinions culminating with the constitutional recognition of same-sex marriage . Justice Kavanaugh , 54 years old , once clerked for Justice Kennedy , who enthusiastically promoted the younger jurist \u2019 s career .\nJustice Kavanaugh didn \u2019 t face such matters during his years as a judge on a lower court , but conservatives have tended to interpret antidiscrimination laws narrowly , typically resolving ambiguities in employers \u2019 favor .\nImportant as the issues are across the political spectrum , the Supreme Court has appeared in no hurry to confront them in recent years . All three appeals were filed last year and lingered on the court \u2019 s agenda for months beyond the typical case . At the end , the justices may have had little choice , as lower courts have issued conflicting decisions .\nTwo of the court \u2019 s new cases involve gay people who allege they were fired because of their sexual orientation .\nIn one , the New York-based Second U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals overruled its own precedents to allow the late Donald Zarda , a skydiving instructor , to sue his former employer . Mr. Zarda said he sometimes told female customers he was gay to ease their potential discomfort in being strapped together with a man for a tandem dive . One client alleged Mr. Zarda touched her inappropriately and disclosed his sexual orientation as a way to excuse his behavior , a claim he denied . Mr. Zarda was fired in 2010 and died in an accident in 2014 .\nChief Judge Robert Katzmann wrote that the Zarda estate should be permitted to pursue its lawsuit . \u201c Sexual orientation discrimination is predicated on assumptions about how persons of a certain sex can or should be , \u201d he wrote . Because it \u201c is motivated by an employer \u2019 s opposition to romantic association between particular sexes , \u201d it qualifies as \u201c discrimination based on the employee \u2019 s own sex . \u201d\nThe second case comes from the Atlanta-based 11th Circuit , which rejected discrimination claims by a gay man fired from his job as child-welfare services coordinator for the juvenile court system in Clayton County , Ga. Gerald Lynn Bostock alleged his sexual orientation , as well as his participation in a gay recreational softball league , led to his termination .\nLast year , a three-judge panel issued a brief unsigned opinion based on a footnote from a 1979 decision by an earlier court stating that \u201c discharge for homosexuality is not prohibited. \u201d That footnote , in turn , relied on an earlier opinion siding with an insurance company that in 1969 turned down a male job applicant because of his \u201c effeminate characteristics . \u201d\nThe employers in both the New York and Georgia cases deny they fired the workers because they were gay , but argue that Title VII\u2014the employment provision of the Civil Rights Act that prohibits discrimination based on \u201c race , color , religion , sex , or national origin \u201d \u2014doesn \u2019 t address sexual orientation .\nThe cases also highlight a reversal in the federal government \u2019 s view of gay rights .
