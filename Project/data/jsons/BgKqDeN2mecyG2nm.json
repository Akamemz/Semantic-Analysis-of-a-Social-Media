The cuts are unlikely to be embraced by Congress .\nFor example , the administration is seeking an 8 percent cut to USDA \u2019 s budget over current funding levels . Trump \u2019 s plan would cut the Commerce Department by 37 percent , the Education Department by 8 percent , the Energy Department by 8 percent , the Department of Housing and Urban Development by 15 percent , and the Department of Health and Human Services by 9 percent .\nThe administration is also seeking a 13 percent cut to the Interior Department , a 2 percent cut to the Justice Department , an 11 percent cut to the Labor Department , a nearly 21 percent cut to the State Department and a 13 percent cut to the Department of Transportation . The EPA \u2019 s budget would see a nearly 27 percent chop , the Army Corps of Engineers would see a 22 percent reduction and the Small Business Administration would see an 11 percent decrease .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 NEWSLETTERS \u2588\u2588\u2588 Playbook Sign up today to receive the # 1-rated newsletter in politics .
