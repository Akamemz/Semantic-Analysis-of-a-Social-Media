    "content": "President Obama has vowed to pursue an activist agenda in his final year in office on everything from gun control to climate change , but he \u2019 s likely to be limited in his ambitions by poor relations with Congress , a desire not to step on would-be Democratic successor Hillary Clinton \u2019 s toes and national security challenges beyond his control .\nThe president will outline his plans in the State of the Union address on Jan. 12 , but his prospects for moving significant legislation in Congress in 2016 are slim . Other than a bipartisan criminal-justice reform bill and possible action on a free trade deal with Pacific Rim nations , there are no other major initiatives by a lame-duck president in an election year that are likely to succeed .\nThat means much of Mr. Obama \u2019 s agenda , from environmental regulations to the highly anticipated action on guns to the slow-motion closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention center , will come through executive action , a go-it-alone strategy that he has employed for most of his second term .\n\u201c Obama will stress executive action ; it \u2019 s the only thing he can do , \u201d said Charles Lipson , a political science professor at the University of Chicago . \u201c But he \u2019 s constrained in a second way : He \u2019 s got a member of his own party \u201d \u2014 Mrs. Clinton \u2014 \u201c who after the primaries will try to run to the center . \u201d\nThe president , who knows that a Clinton presidency is the most likely way to preserve his legacy in areas such as health care and climate change , will try to do no harm to her campaign .\n\u201c Given that Hillary is going to be the nominee unless she \u2019 s indicted , she can count on President Obama not trying to undermine her position , \u201d Mr. Lipson said .\nThere are two decisions looming outside the purview of the White House that could seriously complicate the president \u2019 s final year \u2014 a Pentagon inspector general \u2019 s investigation into whether military aides \u201c scrubbed \u201d intelligence reports to give Mr. Obama an overly rosy view of the fight against the Islamic State and a Supreme Court ruling on the future of affirmative action . It \u2019 s not known when the watchdog \u2019 s probe of the Defense Department will conclude ; the high court ruling is expected by the end of June .\nPublicly and behind closed doors , Mr. Obama is reminding aides that it \u2019 s the final half of the \u201c fourth quarter \u201d of his presidency , and he still feels an urgency to push his progressive agenda .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve never been more optimistic about a year ahead than I am right now , \u201d Mr. Obama said in his final news conference of the year . \u201c In 2016 I \u2019 m going to leave it out all on the field . \u201d\nBut as he enters his last year in office , Mr. Obama seems to be in a rut as far as his ability to rally Americans to support his proposals .\nWhile pundits have been talking about \u201c Obama fatigue \u201d for years , recent polls are bearing out the notion that the public has grown weary of the president . An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll this month found 73 percent of respondents want the next president to pursue a \u201c different approach \u201d from Mr. Obama , while only 25 percent want to follow a similar course .\nWhile the unemployment rate has dropped to 5 percent , the lowest of Mr. Obama \u2019 s presidency , people don \u2019 t feel reassured about the economy or their personal financial security . A national survey by the Pew Research Center last week found that Americans are less optimistic about how the economy will perform over the next year , with only 20 percent expecting conditions to improve . A year ago , the same poll found that 31 percent of respondents expected the economy to get better .\nPew researchers found that attitudes about the economy today are similar to January 2008 , near the end of George W. Bush \u2019 s presidency , a few months before the financial crisis hit .\nForeign policy and national security , often the focal points of second-term presidents , don \u2019 t look promising for Mr. Obama \u2019 s legacy as he heads into 2016 . The terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino , California , have renewed criticism of Mr. Obama \u2019 s handling of the Islamic State and placed national security ahead as the top concern of Americans in polls , ahead of the economy .\nWhile the president has repeatedly told the public about steps to beef up the military coalition fighting the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq , he also is trying to lower expectations about keeping the homeland completely safe , saying the extremists \u2019 use of social media and \u201c lone wolf \u201d attacks make it more difficult for authorities to prevent attacks .\nIn an interview last week with NPR , Mr. Obama said the Islamic State \u201c is not an organization that can destroy the United States . \u201d\n\u201c This is not a huge industrial power that can pose great risks to us institutionally or in a systematic way , \u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201c The most damage they can do , though , is if they start changing how we live and what our values are , and part of my message over the next 14 months or 13 months that I remain in office is to just make sure that we remember who we are and make sure that our resilience , our values , our unity are maintained . If we do that , then [ Islamic State ] will be defeated . \u201d\nMr. Lipson said a terrorist attack is the \u201c wild card \u201d for Mr. Obama \u2019 s final year in office .\n\u201c If there are any successful large-scale terrorist attacks then I think the president \u2019 s position is deeply eroded , \u201d he said .\nHe included the possibility of high-profile crimes by illegal immigrants in so-called \u201c sanctuary cities \u201d as another crisis that would undermine Mr. Obama \u2019 s authority in particular and Democrats \u2019 standing in general .\n\u201c Anything that goes wrong there , the Republicans will try to pin the tail on the Democratic donkey for failing in its fundamental duty to protect the public , \u201d Mr. Lipson said .\nMr. Obama also is still pressing to close the Guantanamo Bay terrorist detention facility in Cuba , whether by executive action or through a slower process of releasing prisoners to countries willing to accept them . The administration is preparing for one of the largest transfers of detainees since 2007 , action that could reduce the prisoner population to as low as 90 by the end of January .\nThere are 107 detainees still being held at Guantanamo , of whom 48 have been approved for release , according to the American Civil Liberties Union .\nLawmakers in both parties have consistently blocked Mr. Obama \u2019 s plans to close the facility and transfer the remaining detainees to prisons on the mainland U.S .\nIn Congress , one of the few prospects for action in 2016 is the bipartisan proposal on criminal-justice reform , which would reduce the length of mandatory minimum sentences and limit them to serious drug felonies and violent crimes .\nThe Senate bill would ban solitary confinement for juveniles , and it would grant judges more flexibility on sentences for a range of crimes . The measure also would support re-entry programs in federal prisons aimed at reducing recidivism .\nMr. Obama has been ramping up his efforts at granting clemency to prisoners convicted of drug crimes , many under sentencing guidelines developed in the 1980s in response to the popularity of crack cocaine . On Dec. 18 Mr. Obama commuted the sentences of 91 federal prison inmates , bringing the total during his presidency to 184 , the most since the administration of Lyndon B.
