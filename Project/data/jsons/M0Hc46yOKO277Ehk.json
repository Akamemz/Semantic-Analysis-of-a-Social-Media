    "content": "Last year , as 2015 debuted , I published , \u201c 15 ways to improve your life. \u201d The tradition continues this year , with the addition of number 16 . I \u2019 ve also added bits and pieces to some of the 15 items from last year , just to keep you on your toes .\nNew Year \u2019 s resolutions often lose their power so quickly and completely that they have become clich\u00e9 . But there are real , easily achieved ways to positively impact your life beginning January 1 .\nHere \u2019 s your cheat sheet of 16 for 2016 . They aren \u2019 t in any particular order , so you can pick any one to start with .\nIf you complete just five , you \u2019 ll notice a demonstrable improvement in your existence . But if you get through half of them , you could remake your life .\n1 . Try to recall one dream you had as a kid \u2014 whether it was being a poet or a rock drummer or a multimillionaire stock trader \u2014 and take just a single step in that direction . So often , the ideas we had as children were good ones , and we abandoned them out of fear . The step in the direction of your childhood dream can be very modest \u2014 signing up for a symposium on poetry , scheduling a single drum lesson , buying a DVD on stock trading . Even just telling two people about your quiet dream can move it forward . Frozen dreams have a way of thawing out rapidly when you warm them just a tiny bit .\n2 . Think of your life story , going all the way back to infancy , as an autobiographical book that you can hold in your hands . Now , imagine which page or paragraph you are tempted to tear out and remove from the story . That page or paragraph might be the one that makes you feel profoundly sad or powerless or guilty or ashamed . Next , share it with someone who knows you well but has never heard about that event or phase in your life . Being willing to disclose the events in life we want to turn a blind eye to takes away the power those events have over us .\n3 . Give a meaningful gift to a friend of yours on a random day \u2014 not his birthday or her anniversary or Christmas . Giving gifts on those days is fine , but that isn \u2019 t the same as an unexpected , unscheduled gift . Those are the ones that feel riskier to give and have more power to bond you to others who receive them . And that \u2019 s because they \u2019 re real and independent expressions of friendship , affection , admiration or love .\n4 . Send handwritten notes to three people you admire most in the world , no matter how powerful or famous , tell them sincerely exactly why you admire them and ask to meet for 10 minutes . There \u2019 s a real chance one of them will take you up on the offer . And that one meeting could change you , because great energy is contagious and being in the company of it can stay with you .\n5 . Give some amount ( no matter how small ) to the charity you care most about . Giving is a miracle , because it helps others while also telling your unconscious mind that yours is a life of abundance , not scarcity . And that invites more treasures into your existence . I suggest using this link to donate ( since I co-founded the company ) .\n6 . Stop telling yourself you love people just because you grew up with them . This is a big one , but a really important one . Did your parents and siblings earn your love by unconditionally loving you as a child ? If so , great . But if you \u2019 ve been wishing that had been the case and have felt unwilling to let the dream of having had unconditionally loving parents or siblings slip away , then loosen your grip . If the people you grew up with weren \u2019 t focused on helping you stay true to yourself , then admit it to yourself . You might stop unconsciously recruiting people just like them into your life .\n7 . Schedule an initial psychotherapy session . Psychotherapy is the gold standard way to begin to get to know yourself more deeply . In a world of distractions and depersonalization , it remains the technique most reliably focused on restoring your connection to your true self . Hopefully , that first session will convince you of the power of psychotherapy to change your life , and you \u2019 ll schedule more . No one with the financial ability to be in psychotherapy should deny himself or herself that transformational opportunity .\n8 . Get angry about something unfair , say so out loud and don \u2019 t stand for it . Anger gets a really bad rap in our culture ; it \u2019 s accused of everything from destroying people spiritually to causing heart attacks . But suppressed anger can be more toxic . When you \u2019 re offended by something you hear about in the news or you see unfolding in your personal life , try saying so , in no uncertain terms , when you \u2019 re asked about it \u2014 or maybe even if you aren \u2019 t . For those of you who have been living lives of quiet frustration , letting yourselves be very direct and very mad about something that sincerely outrages you can start to crack the shell that has your most powerful self inside it .\n9 . Take two minutes to think about life as a labyrinth . Mazes are built to frustrate people and get them lost . They \u2019 re full of dead ends designed to make people give up and call for helicopters to pluck them out . Not so with labyrinths . Labyrinths may wind this way and that way . They may take you far from where you thought you were heading . But they always , always lead to the center . And that \u2019 s what life is like . Keep walking , keep your faith and life will take you where you are supposed to go . The turn toward the center could be just a few steps away , when you least expect it .\n10 . Try praying , at least once . If you haven \u2019 t prayed ever or haven \u2019 t prayed lately , you \u2019 ll discover that the act of praying for what you care deeply about has the effect of reminding you what that thing or those things really are . It also has the effect of reminding you that there is a great power in the universe that you are a part of . There \u2019 s something interesting about praying ; even people who say they don \u2019 t believe in God are loathe to pray for the opposite of what they really want . How come ? Is it because that , underneath all that cynicism , they actually do believe ?\n11 . Read `` Franny and Zooey '' by J.D . Salinger , `` The War of Art '' by Steven Pressfield , \u201c Self Creation \u201d by the great psychologist George Weinberg ( used copies available online ) or `` Blue Dog '' by George Rodrigue ( or , even better , all four ) . These four volumes have the power to transform people , and I keep handing them out to patients and friends ( along with \u2014 please forgive the narcissism \u2014 my book , `` Living the Truth '' ) . If you \u2019 re really short on time or intention , just read the Afterword to a later edition of \u201c Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance , \u201d by Robert Pirsig .\n12 . Buy one piece of art . It doesn \u2019 t need to be expensive . It just needs to appeal to you . Why ? Because art is the antidote to our sometimes sterile , technologically driven culture . It makes humanity go viral in a way that YouTube can \u2019 t . It also confirms your connection to things that can \u2019 t be measured \u2014 like your personal vision of beauty . A good alternative is to create a piece of art . Just be sure to buy yourself the proper brushes or paints or glue or wood to create it . That will be a signal to yourself that you value what you are manifesting .\n13 . Watch the movie `` Miracle , '' with Kurt Russell . This film about the 1980 U.S. Olympic men \u2019 s hockey team defeating Russia \u2019 s team is so good , it can convince you to take on the next great challenge in your life . I don \u2019 t know anyone who has watched it and been unaffected by it . Also watch the closing argument by Paul Newman at the end of the film `` The Verdict , '' the scene of Sylvester Stallone and Talia Shire on the beach in `` Rocky III '' and the monologue by Al Pacino toward the end of the film `` The Scent of a Woman . '' They can help make you a better person . No kidding .\n14 . Tell your romantic partner one thing you would find exciting that you have not yet told that person . In my experience as a therapist , I \u2019 ve found that people can remain strangers to one another , in terms of passion , even after 10 or 20 years of marriage . We keep sexual secrets . Let one out . You can write it down and pass it to your partner as a note , like we did back in grade school , before cell phones . You can text it using a confidential messaging app like Wickr . See what happens . Take the risk .\n15 . Stand up for someone else . You \u2019 ll have the opportunity in 2016 . I promise . Maybe in your home . Maybe in your neighborhood . Maybe at work . Maybe online . Defending someone will reassure that person and empower you .\n16 . Take 16 minutes to pretend that you are speaking to yourself , from the heart , as though you are your own ideal parent . You can do this out loud , if you have the stage presence , or silently . An ideal parent is empathetic , but honest in assessing his child and giving that child advice . Sit yourself down , get very quiet and , then , tell yourself\u2014with the same care you would summon for a son or daughter\u2014two things you really admire about yourself and one very limiting , very disappointing thing about yourself you really wish you would try to change , because it could limit the whole rest of your life . That one thing should be so searingly on-target and so necessary that it has the power to make you angry , make you anxious , bring you to tears or bring you to your knees . Focusing about twice as long ( say , 10 minutes ) on the admirable qualities is something you \u2019 d do for your kid , to take the sting out of the next 6 minutes , so do that for yourself . And keep in mind that 16 minutes is a long time . You \u2019 ll be tempted to avoid it or shorten it . But , you shouldn \u2019 t .\nSo , there are your 16 keys to making 2016 a transformational year . I give them to you with the certain knowledge that you still have , inside you , all the wonderful potential you did the very first day you were born . You haven \u2019 t lost one bit of it . It \u2019 s all there , just waiting for you to discover it .\nDon \u2019 t delay . Start on the list January 1 , and by this time next year , God willing , you \u2019 ll be ready for the 17 steps for 2017 . Like is life that : a never-ending process of self-improvement .",
