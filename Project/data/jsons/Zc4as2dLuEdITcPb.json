    "content": "Anyone lucky enough to have visited the Okavango Delta in the southern African nation of Botswana will recall the comforting and oddly familiar sensation of looking out from the shelter of a stand of trees at the panorama of wildlife\u2014from elephants and African wild dogs to lilac-breasted rollers\u2014moving across the lush surrounding floodplains . That sense of familiarity may run deeper than we imagine , a new study suggests\u2014back to a time when early modern humans also wandered there .\nThe study , appearing Monday in the journal Nature , uses genetic , archaeological , linguistic and climatic evidence to argue that the ancestral homeland of everyone alive today was in northern Botswana\u2014not in East Africa , as previously thought . Based on mitochondrial DNA , passed down from mother to daughter , the paper \u2019 s co-authors argue that we are all descended from a small community of Khoisan hunter-gatherers who lived 200,000 years ago in vast wetlands encompassing Botswana \u2019 s Okavango Delta and the Makgadikgadi regions .\nMuch of that place is now a dry salt pan\u2014and inhabited by modern Khoisan people , sometimes called Bushmen . But back then , it was a vast wetland covering an area the size of Switzerland . The community that lived there was unusually stable , thriving almost unchanged for 70,000 years in a habitat closely resembling the modern Okavango Delta , according to senior author Vanessa M. Hayes , a geneticist at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research in Australia .\nThe new study looks at the mitogenomes , or mitochondrial genomes , of 1,217 individuals from multiple southern African ethnic identities , and focuses on a \u201c rare deep-rooting \u201d lineage called L0 , or L zero . It \u2019 s the oldest known mitochondrial lineage , passed down intact from mother to daughter across the generations , though mutations can sometimes occur and may be associated with important evolutionary changes . Hayes became interested in that lineage as a result of her work with the South African Genome Project , which found evidence of L0 ancestry distributed across southern Africa .

The co-authors of the Nature paper identify and date changes in the L0 lineage .

During the initial 70,000 years of stable habitation , says co-author Axel Timmermann , a climate scientist at Pusan National University in South Korea , migration was probably constrained by harsh , dry conditions in the surrounding landscape . But about 130,000 years ago , a period of increased rainfall opened a green corridor for migrations to the northeast . Then , about 110,000 years ago , drying conditions within the homeland and opening of a green corridor to the southwest led to further migrations down to the southern tip of Africa .
