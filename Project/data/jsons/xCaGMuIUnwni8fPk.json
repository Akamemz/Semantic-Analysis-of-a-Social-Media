People have told wrenching tales of not being able to afford treatment for PTSD after surviving a mass shooting , losing their home , and their boyfriend killing himself after being kicked off Medicaid , as the candidate offers sympathy and encouragement . At times , Sanders has cut himself off during a talk or ditched a planned speech to segue into a conversation with voters .\n\u201c How do you do well in school if you can \u2019 t hear what your professors are saying ? \u201d Sanders said at one event after a 19-year-old college student discussed having to pay more than $ 5,000 for a hearing aid . \u201c And this is a story we hear a hundred times . ''\nThe emphasis on intimate , personal interactions with voters is a departure from the early days of Sanders \u2019 2020 campaign , when he often spoke uninterrupted for long periods of time at large rallies .

It is truly a conversation . \u201d\nThough Sanders began holding smaller town halls and events months ago , his aides said he started making them more participatory at the beginning of August . The new format was on display during his 10-stop , three-day swing in Iowa last week . For instance , he was delivering his stump speech for about 15 minutes at a rally at his campaign office in Sioux City , Iowa \u2014 and then stopped .\n\u201c Let me take a break here and ask some of you a question , \u201d he said . \u201c I want people to tell me , if they could , tell me what they \u2019 re paying for health care right now .
