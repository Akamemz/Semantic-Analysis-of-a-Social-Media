    "content": "These are dark times at the Federal Election Commission , which has now gone two months without enough commissioners to enforce federal campaign finance laws .\nThat \u2019 s because U.S. senators and President Donald Trump have failed to strike an agreement to fill any of three vacancies on the six-member commission that needs a quorum of at least four warm bodies to conduct most any high-level business .\nThe agency therefore can \u2019 t pass new rules , pursue investigations , issue fines , even hold formal public meetings .\nWhat does this mean for political candidates , the body politic and U.S. elections in general ?\nA lot , it turns out \u2014 little of it good .\n\u201c The situation encourages chaos , and it encourages corruption , \u201d said former Rep. Zach Wamp , R-Tenn. \u201c Dysfunction is not the American way , and this is a national disgrace . \u201d\nHere \u2019 s what \u2019 s specifically being lost as the FEC zombie-walks into the teeth of Election 2020 :\nPUBLIC NOT WELCOME : Since Sept. 1 , the FEC has canceled four of its public meetings.That \u2019 s on top of three public meetings the agency canceled earlier this year , including two in January because of the partial federal government shutdown . If the FEC can \u2019 t muster a quorum by mid-December , the commission will all but certainly axe another four scheduled public meetings meetings .\nTRUMP GETS REPRIEVE : In June , the \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported that Trump \u2019 s re-election campaign has repeatedly refused to pay public safety bills sent by the municipal governments of cities that have hosted the president \u2019 s campaign rallies . While debate rages over whether the campaign is legally obligated to pay them , federal law appears quite clear that it should at least be reporting these bills as \u201c disputed debt \u201d on its periodic campaign finance disclosures .\nOn Oct. 28 , Rep. Bill Pascrell , D-N.J. , sent a letter to the FEC demanding the agency open an investigation into Trump \u2019 s campaign for failing to disclose disputed debts . So long as the FEC lacks a quorum of commissioners , agency staff can begin work on such an investigation but commissioners themselves can \u2019 t take votes and finish it . The FEC \u2019 s state of affairs is particularly upsetting because Trump is hurting cities and should be held to account , Pascrell said by phone .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a cheap stunt . Horrendous , \u201d the congressman said . \u201c Trump could pay . His campaign has lots of money . These cities should not be taken for granted . Cities are grasping for every dollar for their budgets . \u201d\nINVESTIGATIONS JEOPARDIZED : As of May 1 , the FEC was grappling with a backlog of 289 cases on its enforcement docket . Of those , several dozen contained elements that already had surpassed a five-year statute of limitations or would by May 1 , 2020 , the FEC acknowledged in a letter earlier this year to the U.S. House \u2019 s Committee on House Administration .\nThe FEC didn \u2019 t immediately respond to a question about how large the backlog is today . But it almost certainly has grown since May . And numerous cases are fated , in part or in full , to surpass the statute of limitations \u2014 and therefore , expire , without justice being served .\nIn this regard , the FEC \u2019 s lack of a quorum \u201c is going to exacerbate an already existing problem , \u201d said former Republican FEC Chairman Lee Goodman , now a partner at the law firm Wiley Rein LLP .\nSeveral of the cases on which the FEC hasn \u2019 t acted involve America First Action , a pro-Trump super PAC mired in the Ukraine scandal congressional Democrats are investigating as part of their Trump impeachment inquiry .\nWhen the FEC eventually regains a quorum , its case workload will be massive , warned former Republican FEC Chairman Michael Toner .\n\u201c It \u2019 s quite reasonable to assume that some of the more marginal cases will just be dismissed without action , \u201d Toner said .\nDemocratic presidential candidate Montana Gov . Steve Bullock speaks during the Climate Forum at Georgetown University , Friday , Sept. 20 , 2019 , in Washington . ( AP/Jose Luis Magana )\nNO BULLOCK BUCKS ? Democratic presidential candidate Steve Bullock , the governor of Montana and an outspoken campaign finance reformer , wants access to public presidential matching funds \u2014 an increasingly obsolete reserve nevertheless flush with cash ( more than $ 393 million as of June 30 ) and still available to White House hopefuls who agree to certain fundraising limits .\nOne problem : the FEC must vote on candidates \u2019 requests to access these matching funds . No commissioner quorum ? No vote . Bullock plans to soon file a formal presidential matching fund petition with the FEC , campaign spokeswoman Galia Slayen confirmed , but will \u201c keep options open \u201d if the agency can \u2019 t act . Such options could theoretically include filing a federal lawsuit or petitioning the U.S. Treasury directly .\nRepublican Sen. John McCain \u2019 s thirst for presidential matching funds during his 2008 presidential campaign was a key reason lawmakers and the White House ended the FEC \u2019 s only other extended loss of a quorum \u2014 one that lasted six months .\nFormer Republican FEC Commissioner David Mason , who along with Weintraub were the only two commissioners working during the FEC \u2019 s six-month quorum loss in 2008 , said he \u2019 s not surprised history is repeating itself .\n\u201c Sooner or later , this was bound to happen \u2026 the underlying problem is a political problem and the degree of political division , \u201d Mason said .\nBYPASS SURGERY : Political actors may considering giving up on the FEC as an arbiter of their election law-related complaints . Instead , they may seek relief in federal courts . Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , a nonprofit watchdog organization , indicated as much in a Sept. 16 lawsuit against the FEC .\nCREW alleges that a super PAC supporting the 2016 election of now-former Missouri Gov . Eric Greitens illegally concealed the identities of its funders and that the FEC has been too slow to investigate .\nIf the \u201c FEC proves unwilling or incapable of further action \u201d on CREW \u2019 s initial complaint to the FEC \u2014 read : doesn \u2019 t have enough commissioners to function \u2014 CREW may attempt to pursue its complaint in court . \u201c It \u2019 s an avenue that \u2019 s open , \u201d senior counsel Stuart McPhail confirmed .\nOur investigations .

Among them : the nonprofit Government Accountability Institute , led by conservative author Peter Schweizer . The group \u201c seeks affirmation \u201d from the FEC that it is a \u201c qualified journalistic entity \u201d and is exempt from placing political disclaimers on its published work or disclosing its work as a political contribution .\nIn an email on Sept. 11 to FEC attorney Joanna Waldstreicher , institute attorney Larry Levy granted the agency an extension in issuing an advisory opinion , in recognition that the commission \u201c currently doesn \u2019 t have a quorum and thus can \u2019 t author an advisory opinion. \u201d Two other requests are in similar straits .\nINTERNAL ACRIMONY : Never the best of friends , Democratic Chairwoman Ellen Weintraub and Republican Vice Chairwoman Caroline Hunter \u2014 two of the three remaining FEC commissioners \u2014 are antagonizing one another as much as ever .\nEllen Weintraub , chair of the Federal Election Commission . ( IVN News / Creative Commons )\nWeintraub in September published an epic Twitter thread trolling Hunter over the disputed publication of a weekly FEC activity digest , which was slated to note Weintraub \u2019 s effort to combat foreign influence in U.S. elections .\nHunter , for her part , penned a Politico op-ed on Oct. 22 accusing Weintraub of numerous misdeeds , including \u201c using her official position to drag the FEC into political debates in which it does not belong , to promote herself and her personal views of what the law should be , and to mislead the public. \u201d The op-ed followed a formal request by Rep. Rodney Davis , R-Ill. \u2014 articulating similar complaints to those of Hunter \u2014 for the FEC inspector general \u2019 s office to investigate Weintraub for \u201c potential violations of federal ethics regulations . \u201d\nAnd when Hunter officially assumed the FEC \u2019 s vice chairmanship this week to replace Republican Matthew Petersen , whose resignation on Sept. 1 triggered the agency \u2019 s quorum loss in the first place , Weintraub noted the occasion on Oct. 29 , tweeting thusly : \u201c Congratulations to my colleague , Caroline Hunter , on her election as Vice Chair of the @ FEC for the remainder of 2019 ! \u201d\nSo , what \u2019 s next for the hobbled FEC \u2014 a bipartisan commission where no more than three of the six commissioners may identify with any one political party ?\nHunter has straight up called on Congress to kick her out of office \u2014 along with her two other colleagues .\n\u201c Congress and the president should take a hard look at replacing all three remaining members of the FEC , myself included , and starting fresh with a slate of six new commissioners . No one would blame them if they did , \u201d Hunter wrote .\nWeintraub , who has publicly expressed no such desire and did not respond to interview requests this week , joins Hunter and independent Commissioner Steven Walther in collectively serving 29 years past their six-year terms .\nBut Senate Republicans say they want to appoint a slate of six new commissioners .
