    "content": "The presidential elections of 2016 have several unique characteristics that defy common wisdom about political practices in 21st century America .\nClearly the established political machinery \u2013 party elites and their corporate backers -have ( in part ) lost control of the nomination process and confront \u2018 unwanted \u2019 candidates who are campaigning with programs and pronouncements that polarize the electorate .\nBut there are other more specific factors , which have energized the electorate and speak to recent US history . These portend and reflect a realignment of US politics .\nIn this essay , we will outline these changes and their larger consequences for the future of American politics .\nWe will examine how these factors affect each of the two major parties .\nThe \u2018 rise and decline \u2019 of President Obama has seriously dented the appeal of \u2018 identity politics \u2019 \u2013 the idea that ethnic , race and gender-rooted \u2018 identities \u2019 can modify the power of finance capital ( Wall Street ) , the militarists , the Zionists and \u2018 police-state \u2019 officials . Clearly manifest voter disenchantment with \u2018 identity politics \u2019 has opened the door for class politics , of a specific kind .\nCandidate Bernie Sanders appeals directly to the class interests of workers and salaried employees . But the \u2018 class issue \u2019 arises within the context of an electoral polarization and , as such , it does not reflect a true \u2018 class polarization \u2019 , or rising class struggle in the streets , factories or offices .\nIn fact , the electoral \u2018 class \u2019 polarization is a reflection of the recent major trade union defeats in Michigan , Wisconsin and Ohio . The trade union confederation ( AFL-CIO ) has almost disappeared as a social and political factor , representing only 7 % of private sector workers . Working class voters are well aware that top trade union leaders , who receive an average of $ 500,000-a-year in salaries and benefits , are deeply ensconced in the Democratic Party elite . While individual workers and local unions are active supporters of the Sanders campaign , they do so as members of an amorphous multi-class electoral movement and not as a unified \u2018 workers bloc \u2019 .\nThe Sanders electoral movement has not grown out of a national social movement : The peace movement is virtually moribund ; the civil rights movements are weak , fragmented and localized ; the \u2018 Black Lives Matter \u2019 movement has peaked and declined while the \u2018 Occupy Wall Street Movement \u2019 is a distant memory .\nIn other words , these recent movements , at best , provide some activists and some impetus for the Sanders electoral campaign . Their presence highlights a few of the issues that the Sanders electoral movement promotes in its campaign .\nIn fact , the Sanders electoral movement does not \u2018 grow out \u2019 of existing , ongoing mass movements as much as it fills the political vacuum resulting from their demise . The electoral insurgency reflects the defeats of trade union officials allied with incumbent Democratic politicians as well as the limitation of the \u2018 direct action \u2019 tactics of the \u2018 Black Lives Matter \u2019 and \u2018 Occupy \u2019 movements .\nSince the Sanders electoral movement does not directly and immediately challenge capitalist profits and public budget allocations it has not been subject to state repression . Repressive authorities calculate that this \u2018 buzz \u2019 of electoral activity will last only a few months and then recede into the Democratic Party or voter apathy . Moreover , they are constrained by the fact that tens of millions of Sanders supporters are involved in all the states and not concentrated in any region .\nThe Sanders electoral movement aggregates hundreds of thousands of micro-local struggles and allows expression of the disaffection of millions with class grievances , at no risk or cost ( as in loss of job or police repression ) to the participants . This is in stark contrast to repression at the workplace or in the urban streets .\nThe electoral polarization reflects horizontal ( class ) and vertical ( intra-capitalist ) social polarizations .\nBelow the elite 10 % and especially among the young middle class , political polarization favors the Sanders electoral movement . Trade union bosses , the Black Congressional Caucus members and the Latino establishment all embrace the anointed choice of the political elite of the Democratic Party : Hilary Clinton . Whereas , young Latinos , working women and rank and file trade unionists support the insurgent electoral movement . Significant sectors of the African American population , who have failed to advance ( and have actually regressed ) under Democratic President Obama or have seen police repression expand under the \u2018 First Black President \u2019 , are turning to the insurgent Sanders campaign . Millions of Latinos , disenchanted with their leaders who are tied to the Democratic elite and have done nothing to prevent the massive deportations under Obama , are a potential base of support for \u2018 Bernie \u2019 .\nHowever , the most dynamic social sector in the Sanders electoral movement are students , who are excited by his program of free higher education and the end of post-graduation debt peonage .\nThe malaise of these sectors finds its expression in the \u2018 respectable revolt of the middle class \u2019 : a voters \u2019 rebellion , which has temporarily shifted the axis of political debate within the Democratic Party to the left .\nThe Sanders electoral movement raises fundamental issues of class inequality and racial injustice in the legal , police and economic system . It highlights the oligarchical nature of the political system \u2013 even as the Sanders-led movement attempts to use the rules of the system against its owners . These attempts have not been very successful within the Democratic Party apparatus , where the Party bosses have already allocated hundreds of \u2018 non-elected \u2019 so-called \u2018 mega-delegates \u2019 to Clinton \u2013 despite Sander \u2019 s successes in the early primaries .\nThe very strength of the electoral movement has a strategic weakness : it is in the nature of electoral movements to coalesce for elections and to dissolve after the vote .\nThe Sanders leadership has made no effort to build a mass national social movement that can continue the class and social struggles during and after the elections . In fact , Sanders \u2019 pledge to support the established leadership of the Democratic Party if he losses the nomination to Clinton will lead to a profound disillusionment of his supporters and break-up of the electoral movement . The post-convention scenario , especially in the event of \u2018 super-delegates \u2019 crowning Clinton despite a Sanders popular victory at the individual primaries , will be very disruptive .\nThe Trump electoral campaign has many of the features of a Latin American nationalist-populist movement . Like the Argentine Peronist movement , it combines protectionist , nationalist economic measures that appeal to small and medium size manufacturers and displaced industrial workers with populist right-wing \u2018 great nation chauvinism \u2019 .\nThis is reflected in Trumps \u2019 attacks on \u2018 globalization \u2019 \u2013 a proxy for Peronist \u2018 anti-imperialism \u2019 .\nTrump \u2019 s attack on the Muslim minority in the US is a thinly veiled embrace of rightwing clerical fascism .\nWhere Peron campaigned against \u2018 financial oligarchies \u2019 and the invasion of \u2018 foreign ideologies \u2019 , Trump scorns the \u2018 elites \u2019 and denounces the \u2018 invasion \u2019 of Mexican immigrants .\nTrump \u2019 s appeal is rooted in the deep amorphous anger of the downwardly mobile middle class , which has no ideology . . . but plenty of resentment at its declining status , crumbling stability and drug-afflicted families ( Witness the overtly expressed concerns of white voters in the recent New Hampshire primary ) .\nTrump projects personal power to workers who bridle under impotent trade unions , disorganized civic groups , and marginalized local business associations , all unable to counter the pillage , power and large-scale corruption of the financial swindlers who rotate between Washington and Wall Street with total impunity .\nThese \u2018 populist \u2019 classes get vicarious thrills from the spectacle of Trump snapping and slapping career politicians and economic elites alike , even as he parades his capitalist success .\nThey prize his symbolic defiance of the political elite as he flaunts his own capitalist elite credentials .\nFor many of his suburban backers he is the \u2018 Great Moralizer \u2019 , who in his excess zeal , occasionally , commits \u2018 pardonable \u2019 gaffes out of zealous exuberance \u2013 a crude \u2018 Oliver Cromwell \u2019 for the 21st Century .\nIndeed , there also may be a less overt ethno-religious appeal to Trump \u2019 s campaign : His white-Anglo-Saxon Protestant identity appeals to these same voters in the face of their apparent marginalization . These \u2018 Trumpistas \u2019 are not blind to the fact that not a single WASP judge sits on the Supreme Court and there are few , if any , WASPs among the top economic officials in Treasury , Commerce , or the Fed ( Lew , Fischer , Yellen , Greenspan , Bernacke , Cohen , Pritzker etc. ) . While Trump is not up-front about his identity \u2013 it eases his voter appeal .\nAmong WASP voters , who quietly resent the \u2018 Wall Street \u2019 bailouts and the perceived privileged position of Catholics , Jews and African-Americans in the Obama Administration , Trump \u2019 s direct , public condemnation of President Bush for deliberately misleading the nation into invading Iraq ( and the implication of treason ) , has been a big plus .\nTrump \u2019 s national-populist appeal is matched by his bellicose militarism and thuggish authoritarianism . His public embrace of torture and police state controls ( to \u2018 fight terrorism \u2019 ) appeals to the pro- military right . On the other hand , his friendly overtures to Russian President Putin ( \u2018 one tough guy willing to face another \u2019 ) and his support to end the Cuban embargo appeals to trade-minded business elites . His calls to withdraw US troops from Europe and Asia appeals to \u2018 fortress America \u2019 voters , while his calls to \u2018 carpet bomb \u2019 ISIS appeals to the nuclear extremists . Interestingly , Trump \u2019 s support for Social Security and Medicare , as well as his call for medical coverage for the indigent and his open acknowledgement of Planned Parenthood \u2019 s vital services to poor women , appeals to older citizens , compassionate conservatives and independents .\nTrump \u2019 s left-right amalgam : Protectionist and pro-business appeals , his anti-Wall Street and pro-industrial capitalism proposals , his defense of US workers and attacks on Latino workers and Muslim immigrants have broken the traditional boundaries between popular and rightwing politics of the Republican Party .\n\u2018 Trumpism \u2019 is not a coherent ideology , but a volatile mix of \u2018 improvised positions \u2019 , adapted to appeal to marginalized workers , resentful middle classes ( marginalized WASPs ) and , above all , to those who feel unrepresented by Wall Street Republicans and liberal Democratic politicians based on identity politics ( black , Hispanic , women and Jews ) .\nTrump \u2019 s movement is based on a cult of the personality : it has enormous capacity to convoke mass meetings without mass organization or a coherent social ideology .\nIts fundamental strength is its spontaneity , novelty and hostile focus on strategic elites .\nIts strategic weakness is the lack of an organization that can be sustained after the electoral process . There are few \u2018 Trumpista \u2019 cadres and militants among his adoring fans . If Trump loses ( or is cheated out of the nomination by a \u2018 unity \u2019 candidate \u2019 trotted out by the Party elite ) his organization will dissipate and fragment . If Trump wins the Republican nomination he will draw support from Wall Street , especially if faced with a Sanders Democratic candidacy . If he wins the general election and becomes President , he will seek to strengthen executive power and move toward a \u2018 Bonapartist \u2019 presidency .\nThe rise of a social democratic movement within the Democratic Party and the rise of a sui generis national-populist rightist movement in the Republican Party reflect the fragmented electorate and deep vertical and horizontal fissures characterizing the US ethno-class structure . Commentators grossly oversimplify when they reduce the revolt to incoherent expressions of \u2018 anger \u2019 .\nThe shattering of the established elite \u2019 s control is a product of deeply experienced class and ethnic resentments , of former privileged groups experiencing declining mobility , of local businesspeople experiencing bankruptcy due to \u2018 globalization \u2019 ( imperialism ) and of citizens resentment at the power of finance capital ( the banks ) and its overwhelming control of Washington .\nThe electoral revolts on the left and right may dissipate but they will have planted the seeds of a democratic transformation or of a nationalist-reactionary revival .",
