Not so much .\nThe latest CNN/ORC International poll laid out a stark \u201c enthusiasm gap \u201d between the two parties : Thirty-six percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said they were \u201c very enthusiastic \u201d about voting for president next year , compared with just 19 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents .\nSimilarly , a recent survey by Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg found Republicans , especially older white conservatives , were significantly more interested in the 2016 elections than Democrats and their key demographic groups . Seventy-one percent of likely GOP voters rated their interest in the elections as a \u201c 10 \u201d on a 1-to-10 scale , compared with 58 percent of Democratic voters who said the same .\nIt would seem Republicans are energized and poised to swamp the polls after eight years of President Barack Obama . But Democrats say there \u2019 s no cause for alarm .\n\u201c Sitting here in almost-January-2016 , any diagnostic on enthusiasm or motivation is really useless , \u201d said John Anzalone , one of the pollsters working for Hillary Clinton \u2019 s presidential campaign .\nThe GOP , Democrats assert , has a far more competitive race for the nomination compared to Clinton , who is a strong favorite to win the Democratic nod . Between that and the Donald Trump phenomenon , the Republican race is more captivating \u2014 as evidenced by both poll numbers and television ratings for the five GOP debates , which have consistently drawn larger audiences than the Democratic debates .\n\u201c It is more interesting , \u201d said Democratic pollster Jef Pollock . \u201c If you want to ask me \u2014 a person who \u2019 s never voted for a Republican in my entire life \u2014 of course it \u2019 s more interesting . \u201d\nThe greater Republican enthusiasm , according to pollsters in both parties , is driven largely by longstanding antipathy toward Clinton and Obama \u2014 and also the noisy spectacle of the GOP race . These Democrats are n't worried that their voters aren \u2019 t yet enthusiastic about Clinton \u2019 s candidacy , arguing that they will be fired up to defeat the GOP nominee next fall .\n\u201c While it \u2019 s still quite early , we have seen consistently that support for Hillary Clinton climbs when she is pitted against named Republicans , \u201d said Page Gardner , president and founder of Women \u2019 s Voices , Women Vote Action Fund , a nonprofit that worked with Greenberg on his survey . \u201c So we would expect increased enthusiasm for Clinton \u2014 assuming she is the Democratic nominee \u2014 once the Republicans have picked their candidate . \u201d\n\u201c As much as we want our politics to be all positive , \u201d GOP pollster Jon McHenry agreed , \u201c what drives turnout to a great extent is just being pissed off at somebody . \u201d\nFor now , enthusiasm among Democrats lags that if Republicans , more closely resembling the run-up to Obama \u2019 s 2012 reelection \u2014 when he didn \u2019 t face a primary challenge \u2014 than the record-setting 2008 primary between Obama and Clinton .\nIn an October 2011 CNN poll , 21 percent of Democrats said they were \u201c very enthusiastic \u201d about the coming election , while 38 percent of Republicans said the same .\nCompare that to June 2007 \u2014 the best-available analog in CNN \u2019 s limited trend lines \u2014 when 28 percent of Democrats were \u201c very enthusiastic , \u201d compared with 27 percent of Republicans .\nClinton \u2014 as a result of her front-runner status and her close ties to the current administration \u2014 is functioning as the incumbent , pollsters in both parties said . That makes Democrats less concerned about the lack of a current tide of enthusiasm for her candidacy .\n\u201c On my side , I \u2019 ve got an incumbent with a nagging primary challenge , \u201d said Pollock , the Democratic pollster . \u201c It \u2019 s more like 2012 than it is like 2008 . \u201d\nRepublicans mostly agreed that their current enthusiasm gap is unlikely to hold until the general election \u2014 but also cautioned that Democrats may never be truly pumped for Clinton \u2019 s candidacy .\n\u201c If you \u2019 re the Democrats , and you \u2019 re looking at the combination of Hillary \u2019 s age and the fact she makes a lot of unforced errors and the fact she \u2019 s been around since the early \u2019 90s \u2014 that \u2019 s not exactly the hope and change you \u2019 re looking for , \u201d said Republican pollster Glen Bolger .\n\u201c There \u2019 s always some question of how much enthusiasm there is after eight years for more of the same , even if it \u2019 s a bit different , \u201d Bolger added , pointing to the difficulty of a party winning a third consecutive time before a usually restless electorate .\nThe CNN trend lines hint at this possibility .
