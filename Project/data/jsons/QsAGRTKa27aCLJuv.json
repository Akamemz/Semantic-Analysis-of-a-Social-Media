Voters in November approved a ballot initiative that says the state\u2019s constitution does not protect abortion rights. That cleared the way for state lawmakers to pass new abortion restrictions for the first time in nearly 15 years. Republican state Rep. Rick Womick already has filed bills requiring mandatory ultrasounds and a three-day waiting period for an abortion.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Poll: Romney leads GOP contenders)\n\nSome activists want Tennessee to focus on restrictions that a court struck down in 2000 but could now be permissible.
