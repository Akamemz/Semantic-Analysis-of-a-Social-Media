    "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President Trump bucked most of his top national-security advisers by abandoning retaliatory strikes in Iran on Thursday . In private conversations Friday , Mr. Trump reveled in his judgment , certain about his decision to call off the attacks while speaking of his administration as if removed from the center of it .\n\u201c These people want to push us into a war , and it \u2019 s so disgusting , \u201d Mr. Trump told one confidant about his own inner circle of advisers . \u201c We don \u2019 t need any more wars . \u201d\nIn these conversations , Mr. Trump bemoaned the costs of a drone shot down by Iran\u2014about $ 130 million before research and development\u2014but told people the dollar figure would resonate less with U.S. voters than the potential casualties . The president has said estimates provided to him showed as many as 150 people could have been killed . He noted to confidants that each one of those Iranians had families , which would mean that hundreds more would be affected .\nShare Your Thoughts How should the Trump administration react to Iran \u2019 s downing of a drone over the Gulf of Oman ? Join the conversation below .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t want to kill 150 Iranians , \u201d he told reporters on Saturday , adding that he has Iranian friends back home in New York . \u201c I don \u2019 t want to kill 150 of anything or anybody , unless it \u2019 s absolutely necessary . \u201d\nOn Saturday , Mr. Trump backed a new course of action : another round of sanctions on Tehran to be formally announced on Monday , though he didn \u2019 t offer any additional detail . The administration \u2019 s current package of sanctions against Iran has pushed the country \u2019 s economy into a multiyear contraction and increased tensions in the region . But the measures have yet to persuade Tehran to open negotiations with Mr. Trump , who is seeking an agreement to curb Iran \u2019 s nuclear ambitions .\nWhile many of Mr. Trump \u2019 s top advisers backed a more aggressive set of strike options , Marine Gen. Joe Dunford , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , struck a more wary note , which had an outsize influence on the president .\nMr. Trump himself Saturday publicly described the conflict within his own team that remained a sore spot for some involved . He praised Gen. Dunford for counseling caution , while singling out his past disagreements with his hawkish national-security adviser John Bolton , who was the driving force behind the proposed strikes .\nMr. Trump described Gen. Dunford , who officials said has developed a personal rapport with the president , as a \u201c terrific man and a terrific general. \u201d He raised Mr. Bolton \u2019 s support for the Iraq war during President George W. Bush \u2019 s administration , saying it was a big mistake .\n\u201c John Bolton is doing a good job , but he takes generally a tough posture , \u201d Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House . \u201c The only one that matters is me . \u201d\nThe president is known for seeking a range of opinions , and he did that again amid rising tensions with Iran , even reaching out to Fox News host Tucker Carlson , according to people familiar with those conversations . Mr. Carlson has opposed military intervention in Iran on his prime-time television show .\nMr. Trump said he wants a certain amount of division within his team as he makes a decision , and suggested he was proud about how that reflected on him .\n\u201c Everybody was saying I \u2019 m a warmonger , and now they \u2019 re saying I \u2019 m a dove , \u201d Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House . \u201c And I \u2019 m neither , if you want to know the truth . I \u2019 m a man with common sense . \u201d\nBut members of Mr. Trump \u2019 s team weren \u2019 t as pleased with the president about the internal schism , which appeared to strain the fragile alliance within this group at yet another period of transition , according to administration officials . It was unclear whether the division within the team\u2014which includes Mr. Trump \u2019 s third national-security adviser , second secretary of state and third official in charge of the Defense Department\u2014would heal or continue to fester .\nAs an illustration of the behind-the-scenes squabbling Saturday , one administration official said the Pentagon thwarted agreed-upon plans in Iran by using backchannels to provide Mr. Trump with inaccurate estimates of casualties . This official said a Pentagon attorney sent the estimate to the White House Counsel \u2019 s Office , which gave it to the president .\nBut another administration official dismissed the accusations as sour grapes . One official said the number of 150 casualties was generated at the White House , not the Pentagon , which routinely uses a \u201c collateral damage assessment \u201d of its own with any significant military operation . But the military \u2019 s range of options didn \u2019 t include a number that high , two officials said .\nSpokesmen for the White House and Pentagon declined to comment .\n\u201c As senior military adviser to the president , Gen. Dunford did provide his military advice on Iran , \u201d said Col. Pat Ryder , a spokesman for Gen. Dunford . \u201c However , I have nothing further to provide in regards to President Trump \u2019 s comments . As a matter of policy , we do not discuss deliberations . \u201d\nMr. Trump , for his part , acknowledged that the estimate came from attorneys , but ultimately was delivered to him by a general . Asked whether it was Gen. Dunford , the Pentagon \u2019 s top military officer , President Trump declined to say directly , responding : \u201c I had a long talk with Dunford . He \u2019 s a great gentleman . \u201d\nThe attack on a U.S. drone was just the latest in a series of provocative actions from Tehran and prompted a national-security team meeting Thursday morning\u2014a breakfast in the White House\u2014at Mr. Bolton \u2019 s request .\nThe breakfast is a weekly meeting for Mr. Bolton , Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan . On Thursday , it also included Gen.
