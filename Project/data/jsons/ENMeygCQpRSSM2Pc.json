    "content": "The ninth GOP debate featured the top six remaining candidates for the party \u2019 s presidential nomination . They repeated several false and misleading claims , and made some new ones , too .\n\u2022 Sen. Ted Cruz claimed that \u201c we have 80 years of precedent of not confirming Supreme Court justices in an election year. \u201d That \u2019 s wrong . Justice Anthony Kennedy was confirmed in 1988 , an election year .\n\u2022 Businessman Donald Trump called Cruz the \u201c single biggest liar \u201d for saying Trump \u201c supports federal taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood. \u201d But Trump did leave open the possibility of funding some aspects before later saying he wouldn \u2019 t support funding as long as the group performed abortions .\n\u2022 Sen. Marco Rubio said that illegal immigration \u201c is worse today than it was three years ago , which is worse than it was five years ago. \u201d The estimated number of immigrants in the country illegally has remained stable over that time .\n\u2022 Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson attributed a quote to Joseph Stalin that experts say didn \u2019 t come from the Soviet dictator .\n\u2022 Trump falsely claimed that a failed eminent domain case to benefit a Trump casino project in 1998 \u201c wasn \u2019 t for a parking lot. \u201d It was .\n\u2022 Former Florida governor Jeb Bush conflated two Trump quotes in claiming Trump called Sen. John McCain a \u201c loser because he was a P.O.W. \u201d Trump said he was a loser , because he lost the 2008 presidential election .\n\u2022 Trump claimed that the nation \u2019 s economy \u201c didn \u2019 t grow \u201d in the last quarter . It did grow , by a small amount .\n\u2022 Trump repeated his claim that he is a self-funded candidate . Not entirely . His money makes up 66 % of his campaign \u2019 s money through the end of 2015 . The rest comes from individual donors .\nAnd there were several other repeated claims we \u2019 ve fact-checked before on jobs , taxes , immigration and regulation .\nThe debate was held in Greenville , S.C. , and moderated by John Dickerson of CBS News . Participating were : former Florida governor Jeb Bush , retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson , Texas Sen. Ted Cruz , Ohio Gov . John Kasich , Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and businessman Donald Trump . It was the first Republican debate since New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie and former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina ended their presidential campaigns .\nDickerson asked the candidates if , given the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia , President Obama should use his constitutional authority to name a replacement justice this year .\nCruz claimed that \u201c we have 80 years of precedent of not confirming Supreme Court justices in an election year. \u201d That \u2019 s wrong .\nPresident Ronald Reagan nominated Justice Anthony Kennedy to the high court on Nov. 30 , 1987 , and Kennedy was confirmed by the Senate on Feb. 3 , 1988 , by a vote of 97-0 . That was the same year that George H.W . Bush was elected to succeed Reagan as president .\nKennedy was actually Reagan \u2019 s third nominee to replace retiring Justice Lewis Powell . Robert Bork , who Reagan nominated on July 1 , 1987 , was rejected by a vote of 42-58 on Oct. 23 , 1987 . And Douglas Ginsburg withdrew his name from consideration in early November 1987 , after acknowledging that he had smoked marijuana several times .\nWhen Dickerson pointed out that Kennedy was confirmed in 1988 , Cruz said , \u201c No , Kennedy was confirmed in \u2019 87. \u201d But Dickerson was right and Cruz was wrong .\nThat also makes Rubio \u2019 s claim that \u201c it has been over 80 years since a lame duck president has appointed a Supreme Court justice \u201d problematic .\nIf Rubio considers Obama to be a \u201c lame duck president , \u201d meaning his time as president will soon be over , the same could be said of Reagan , who nominated a replacement justice well into his second and final term as president .\nWhen Cruz said Trump \u201c supports federal taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood , \u201d Trump responded that Cruz was the \u201c single biggest liar. \u201d Trump said in August that he didn \u2019 t support funding abortions performed by Planned Parenthood but he left open the possibility of funding other aspects of the group \u2019 s work on women \u2019 s health .\nIn early September , however , Trump said , \u201c I wouldn \u2019 t do any funding as long as they are performing abortions . \u201d\nHere \u2019 s part of the disagreement between the two candidates in the debate :\nTrump : Where did I support ? Cruz : You supported it when we were battling over defunding Planned Parenthood . You went on\u2026 Trump : That \u2019 s a lot of lies . Cruz : You said , \u201c Planned Parenthood does wonderful things and we should not defund it. \u201d Trump : It does do wonderful things but not as it relates to abortion . Cruz : So I \u2019 ll tell you what\u2026 Trump : Excuse me . Excuse me , there are wonderful things having to do with women \u2019 s health . Cruz : You see you and I\u2026 Trump : But not when it comes to abortion .\nIn an Aug. 11 , 2015 , interview with CNN \u2019 s Chris Cuomo , Trump said , \u201c Well , the biggest problem I have with Planned Parenthood is the abortion situation . It \u2019 s like an abortion factory frankly . You can \u2019 t have it and it shouldn \u2019 t be funding and that should not be funded by the government . I feel strongly about that . \u201d\nHe went on to say , \u201c What I would do is look at the individual things that they do and maybe some of the things are good , I know a lot of things are bad . But certainly the abortion aspect of it should not be funded by government . \u201d\nCuomo followed up , asking , \u201c So you would take a look at it before you defund it . That \u2019 s what is being asked for right now . Many in your party are doing the opposite . They are saying defund it and then look at it . You \u2019 d say look at it first . \u201d\nTrump responded : \u201c I would look at the good aspects of it . I would also look as I \u2019 m sure they do some things properly and good and good for women . I would look at that . I would look at other aspects also , but we have to take care of women . We have to absolutely take care of women . The abortion aspect of Planned Parenthood should not be funded . \u201d\nSo , Trump did not say he supported cutting off all federal funding to Planned Parenthood , as other Republicans , including Cruz , have done . He did say that abortions performed by Planned Parenthood shouldn \u2019 t be funded . ( For the record , federal funding for abortion is restricted by the Hyde Amendment to only abortion cases involving rape , incest or endangerment to the life of the mother . )\nBut , as CNN wrote in a headline on the Trump interview , he has waffled on this issue . A week earlier , on Aug. 4 , 2015 , radio host Hugh Hewitt asked whether Trump would support shutting down the government in an attempt to cut off federal funding to Planned Parenthood . Trump responded : \u201c I would . \u201d\nTrump has made other conflicting statements . Also on Aug. 11 , in an interview with Fox News when asked whether taxpayers should give Planned Parenthood a penny since it performs abortions , Trump said that abortion services was a small part of what the group did and that it provided important services to women ( starting at the 5:50 mark ) .\nTrump , Aug. 11 , Fox News : Let \u2019 s say there \u2019 s two Planned Parenthoods in a way . You have it as an abortion clinic . Now that \u2019 s actually a fairly small part of what they do , but it \u2019 s a brutal part and I \u2019 m totally against it and I wouldn \u2019 t do that . They also however service women . \u2026 We have to help women . A lot of women are helped . We have to look at the positives , also , for Planned Parenthood .\nTrump left open the possibility of cutting off funding unless the group stops performing abortions , saying , \u201c Maybe unless they stop with the abortions , we don \u2019 t do the funding for the stuff that we want . There are many ways you can do that . \u201d\nBut then in another Fox News interview on Sept. 8 with Bill O \u2019 Reilly , Trump took a harder line and denied that he supported funding the group : \u201c No , I mean a lot of people say it \u2019 s an abortion clinic . I \u2019 m opposed to that . And I wouldn \u2019 t do any funding as long as they are performing abortions . And they are performing abortions . So I would be opposed to funding \u2014 I would be totally opposed to funding , \u201d Trump said .\nRubio said that illegal immigration \u201c is worse today than it was three years ago , which is worse than it was five years ago. \u201d It has remained pretty flat in that time .\nThere were 11.3 million people living in the U.S. illegally in 2014 . That \u2019 s the most recent estimate from the Pew Research Center . That is lower than the 11.5 million the center estimated were living in the U.S. illegally three years earlier in 2011 , and the same as the 11.3 million in 2009 .\nOverall , \u201c [ t ] his population has remained essentially stable for five years after nearly two decades of changes , \u201d Pew said in its July 2015 report .\nIn his closing statement , Carson attributed a quote to Joseph Stalin that experts say didn \u2019 t come from the Soviet dictator .\n\u201c Joseph Stalin said if you want to bring America down you , have to undermine three things : our spiritual life , our patriotism and our morality , \u201d Carson said . \u201c We , the people , can stop that decline , starting right here in South Carolina . \u201d\nThe Internet myth-busters at Snopes.com looked into the quote when it made the rounds as a Facebook meme ( the exact quote attributed to Stalin then was , \u201c America is like a healthy body and its resistance is threefold : its patriotism , its morality , and its spiritual life . If we can undermine these three areas , America will collapse from within. \u201d ) . Snopes searched collections of Stalin \u2019 s speeches , writings , interviews and other statements and was unable to turn up any reference to that quote . Snopes also noted that none of the numerous citations on the Internet referenced a verifiable source for the quote .\nAfter the debate , we reached out to David Brandenberger , an associate professor of history and international studies at the University of Richmond , who has written extensively about Stalin , and he told us the quote is bogus .\n\u201c Indeed , the only thing more remarkable than Carson quoting Stalin at the debate was that he attributed to him a made-up quotation , \u201d Brandenberger told us via email . \u201c Of course , Stalin is often credited with apocryphal statements ( \u2018 Death is the solution to all problems . No man \u2013 no problem , \u2019 etc . ) , but that doesn \u2019 t excuse Carson tonight . \u201d\nStanford history professor Norman Naimark , who holds the Robert and Florence McDonnell Chair in East European History and wrote \u201c Stalin \u2019 s Genocides , \u201d told us he has never heard of that quote from Stalin either . \u201c I suspect Carson made it up , but I don \u2019 t know for sure , \u201d Naimark told us .\nTrump and Bush once again argued over New Jersey \u2019 s failed attempts to use eminent domain to benefit a Trump casino project in Atlantic City . But , in defending himself , Trump misrepresented the case .\nTrump falsely claimed that the eminent domain case \u201c wasn \u2019 t for a parking lot , \u201d but rather for \u201c a very large tower \u201d that would \u201c employ thousands. \u201d But the eminent domain case was for a parking lot . A \u201c very large tower \u201d was not part of the condemnation proceedings , but there was a proposed hotel renovation that would have been accomplished through a private sale .\nTrump : When Jeb had said , \u201c You used eminent domain privately for a parking lot. \u201d It wasn \u2019 t for a parking lot . The state of New Jersey \u2014 too bad Chris Christie is not here , he could tell you \u2014 the state of New Jersey went to build a very large tower that was going to employ thousands of people . I mean , it was going to really do a big job in terms of economic development .\nHere are the facts , as we have reported once before : The state Casino Reinvestment Development Authority attempted to condemn three parcels of land in Atlantic City as part of a $ 28.6 million hotel project proposed by Trump Plaza Associates . The properties were owned separately by three families with the last names Banin , Coking and Sabatini .\nHere \u2019 s how a state court judge , in ruling against the state and Trump in 1998 , described Trump \u2019 s proposal and the three properties that the state wanted to condemn to complete it :\nCasino Reinvestment Development Authority v. Banin , July 20 , 1998 : Trump \u2019 s project called for the redevelopment of the city block abutting the boardwalk between the Trump Plaza Hotel-Casino and Caesars Hotel-Casino . The block was located in the Corridor Area which was an area previously identified by CRDA for redevelopment . The site was occupied by the former Holiday Inn Hotel , the rusting steel structure of the aborted Penthouse Hotel-Casino project , some undeveloped lots and a few private residences and small businesses . Included within the site were the properties of defendants Banin , Coking and Sabatini . Trump \u2019 s project proposed creation of a 361-room hotel by rehabilitation of the Holiday Inn building ; removal of the dilapidated Penthouse steel structure ; construction of surface parking and a driveway bisecting the block from Missouri Avenue to the entrance of the Trump Plaza Hotel ; and creation of a park or privately-owned landscaped area along Pacific Avenue . The project also called for construction of a two-story porte-cochere at the Trump Plaza entrance spanning Columbia Place , the public street between Trump Plaza and the site , as well as linkage of the renovated hotel to Trump Plaza by way of a sky bridge over Columbia Place near the Boardwalk .\nSuperior Court Judge Richard Williams wrote in his opinion that the \u201c parcels in the area proposed for the driveway , surface parking , and the landscaped park area were held by other owners . Because Trump had previously been unable to acquire these privately-owned parcels , CRDA was requested to use its power of eminent domain for their acquisition . \u201d\nWilliams wrote that under Trump \u2019 s plan \u201c Coking \u2019 s property [ would ] be blacktopped and used for surface parking and Banin and Sabatini \u2019 s properties would be planted with grass and used for a park or green space . \u201d\nIt was Vera Coking who was featured in a Cruz ad attacking Trump for seeking to bulldoze Coking \u2019 s home \u201c for a limousine parking lot for his casino. \u201d As the Philadelphia Inquirerreported in 1998 , Trump proposed \u201c a limousine waiting area \u201d on Coking \u2019 s property .\nSo , while Trump can make the argument that his project would have created jobs , he can not say that the eminent domain case \u201c wasn \u2019 t for a parking lot. \u201d It was for a parking lot and public park to complete the project .\nIn a pointed exchange , Bush claimed Trump once called Sen. John McCain a \u201c loser because he was a P.O.W. \u201d Trump called McCain a loser , but not because he was a prisoner of war . He called him a \u201c loser \u201d because he lost the 2008 presidential election to Barack Obama .\nIn the debate , Bush said , \u201c And , it \u2019 s really weak to call John McCain a loser because he was a P.O.W . \u201d\n\u201c I never called him \u2014 I don \u2019 t call him , \u201d Trump responded .\n\u201c That is outrageous , \u201d Bush continued . \u201c The guy \u2019 s an American hero . \u201d\nThere are two Trump quotes in question here . And Bush was conflating them .\nAt the Family Leadership Summit in Ames , Iowa , in July , Trump said of McCain , \u201c He \u2019 s not a war hero . He was a war hero because he was captured . I like people who weren \u2019 t captured. \u201d In comments to the media after his speech , Trump seemed to walk that back a bit , saying , \u201c If somebody \u2019 s a prisoner , I consider them a war hero . \u201d\nIn the same speech , Trump also took a shot at McCain for losing the 2008 presidential race to Barack Obama .\n\u201c He lost , \u201d Trump said . \u201c He let us down . I never liked him as much after that because I don \u2019 t like losers . \u201d\nTrump claimed that the nation \u2019 s economy \u201c didn \u2019 t grow \u201d in the last quarter . It did grow , although fourth-quarter growth was weak .\nTrump : We have an economy that last quarter , GDP didn \u2019 t grow . It was flat . We have to make our economy grow again .\nIn a Jan. 29 press release , the Bureau of Economic Analysis said the nation \u2019 s gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 0.7 % in the fourth quarter of 2015 . For the year , the U.S. economy grew by 2.4 % \u2014 the same as 2014 , BEA said .\nTrump repeated his claim that he is a \u201c self-funder \u201d when it comes to funding his campaign . Not completely , he isn \u2019 t .\nTrump \u2019 s presidential campaign received $ 19.4 million in 2015 , according to Trump \u2019 s year-end filing with the Federal Election Commission in January . Trump loaned his campaign $ 12.6 million of that amount , and he made additional in-kind contributions of $ 219,000 . So , nearly 66 % of the campaign \u2019 s money has come from Trump . The other 34 % , or $ 6.5 million , has come from individual donors .\nWe should also note that since Trump has loaned that money to his campaign , rather than donating it , he could potentially get it back . The individual donations that the campaign has received are enough to cover about half of the campaign \u2019 s $ 12.4 million in spending as of Dec. 31 , 2015 .\nGroundhog Day was less than two weeks ago , but watching the Republican debate felt a bit like that for us at FactCheck.org \u2014 we have seen many of the same misleading claims crop up again and again . Here are some of the repeat claims we heard :\n\u2022 Cruz : \u201c The business flat tax that is in my tax plan is not a VAT [ Value-Added Tax ] . A VAT in Europe is a sales tax. \u201d As we wrote when this came up during the sixth Republican debate , the nonpartisan , business-funded Tax Foundation has described the Cruz proposal as a \u201c subtraction method value-added tax , \u201d and the conservative National Review also describes it as a VAT .\n\u2022 Bush : \u201c The Cato Institute , which grades governors based on their spending , rank [ Kasich ] right at the bottom. \u201d We wrote about this recently after ads from the pro-Bush super PAC Right to Rise cited Cato Institute \u2019 s 2014 \u201c Fiscal Policy Report Card on America \u2019 s Governors , \u201d in which it gave Kasich an overall \u201c D \u201d rating and rated him worst among all governors on spending . We noted that the rating is based on data about Ohio \u2019 s general revenue fund spending , but the nonpartisan group that published the data warned that the figures for Ohio were skewed , for state comparison purposes , due to accounting methods employed by the state for Medicaid expenditures .\n\u2022 Bush : \u201c We led the nation in job growth seven out of eight years \u201d when he was governor of Florida . Bush has twisted jobs data a few different ways during the campaign , and this time his campaign says he is referring to the total number of jobs created in the last seven years of his governorship . As we noted last June , Florida gained more net jobs than any other state , regardless of size , in three of the eight years Bush was governor . But when it comes to the rate of job growth \u2014 which factors in the size of the state \u2019 s job market \u2013 Florida ranked fifth over the entire eight years of Bush \u2019 s two terms .\n\u2022 Cruz : \u201c Marco [ Rubio ] went on Univision in Spanish and said he would not rescind President Obama \u2019 s illegal executive amnesty on his first day in office. \u201d As we explained when Cruz made a similar charge on two Sunday talk shows on Jan. 31 , Rubio said he wouldn \u2019 t immediately revoke Obama \u2019 s 2012 order protecting so-called \u201c Dreamers \u201d \u2014 young people brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents \u2014 though he said it would have to end \u201c at some point. \u201d But Rubio has said he would revoke Obama \u2019 s 2014 executive action that protects as many as 5 million adults from deportation .\n\u2022 Rubio : \u201c And here is the truth , Ted Cruz supported legalizing people that were in this country illegally. \u201d We \u2019 ve covered this one repeatedly , as it has come up in multiple debates . We covered the issue in detail after the fifth Republican debate , and the gist of it is that Cruz offered an amendment to a Senate immigration bill to strip it of a path to citizenship \u2014 although it would have left open the possibility of legalization . Cruz spoke many times in favor of his amendment , advocating its passage , but Cruz \u2019 s campaign says that was a political bluff to show that the real aim of the bill \u2019 s supporters was a path to citizenship , and that he never actually supported legalization .\n\u2022 Carson : \u201c You know , when you consider how much regulations cost us each year , you know ? $ 2 trillion dollars per family , $ 24,000 per family. \u201d We last wrote about this when then Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry said in February 2015 that the cost of government regulation \u201c hits American families for $ 15,000 a year. \u201d That figure comes from a conservative group \u2019 s admitted \u201c back-of-the-envelope \u201d calculation of estimated regulatory costs that does not include any potential savings . The Competitive Enterprise Institute has released a newer version of the report cited by Perry , but the same shortcomings apply .\n\u2022 Rubio : \u201c Well , first of all , I think amnesty is the forgiveness of a wrongdoing without consequence and that \u2014 I \u2019 ve never supported that. \u201d We wrote about Rubio \u2019 s evolution on immigration , as well as his evolving definition of amnesty back in 2013 . In that story , we noted that in 2011 , Rubio derided an \u201c earned path to citizenship \u201d as another word for \u201c amnesty . \u201d\n\u2022 Kasich : \u201c We have grown the number of jobs by 400,000 private-sector jobs since I \u2019 ve been governor. \u201d As we wrote when Kasich made a similar boast in the seventh GOP debate , Ohio has , in fact , gained 400,700 private-sector jobs under Kasich . Still , Ohio \u2019 s private-sector job growth rate of 9.3 % during Kasich \u2019 s tenure lags behind the national private-sector growth rate of 11.7 % .\nRubio challenges Cruz on immigration , says he does n't speak Spanish",

It\u2019s like an abortion factory frankly. You can\u2019t have it and it shouldn\u2019t be funding and that should not be funded by the government. I feel strongly about that.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say, \u201cWhat I would do is look at the individual things that they do and maybe some of the things are good, I know a lot of things are bad. But certainly the abortion aspect of it should not be funded by government.\u201d\n\nCuomo followed up, asking, \u201cSo you would take a look at it before you defund it. That\u2019s what is being asked for right now. Many in your party are doing the opposite. They are saying defund it and then look at it. You\u2019d say look at it first.\u201d\n\nTrump responded: \u201cI would look at the good aspects of it. I would also look as I\u2019m sure they do some things properly and good and good for women. I would look at that. I would look at other aspects also, but we have to take care of women. We have to absolutely take care of women. The abortion aspect of Planned Parenthood should not be funded.\u201d\n\nSo, Trump did not say he supported cutting off all federal funding to Planned Parenthood, as other Republicans, including Cruz, have done. He did say that abortions performed by Planned Parenthood shouldn\u2019t be funded. (For the record, federal funding for abortion is restricted by the Hyde Amendment to only abortion cases involving rape, incest or endangerment to the life of the mother.)\n\nBut, as CNN wrote in a headline on the Trump interview, he has waffled on this issue. A week earlier, on Aug. 4, 2015, radio host Hugh Hewitt asked whether Trump would support shutting down the government in an attempt to cut off federal funding to Planned Parenthood. Trump responded: \u201cI would.\u201d\n\nTrump has made other conflicting statements. Also on Aug. 11, in an interview with Fox News when asked whether taxpayers should give Planned Parenthood a penny since it performs abortions, Trump said that abortion services was a small part of what the group did and that it provided important services to women (starting at the 5:50 mark).\n\nTrump, Aug. 11, Fox News: Let\u2019s say there\u2019s two Planned Parenthoods in a way. You have it as an abortion clinic. Now that\u2019s actually a fairly small part of what they do, but it\u2019s a brutal part and I\u2019m totally against it and I wouldn\u2019t do that. They also however service women. \u2026 We have to help women. A lot of women are helped. We have to look at the positives, also, for Planned Parenthood.\n\nTrump left open the possibility of cutting off funding unless the group stops performing abortions, saying, \u201cMaybe unless they stop with the abortions, we don\u2019t do the funding for the stuff that we want. There are many ways you can do that.\u201d\n\nBut then in another Fox News interview on Sept. 8 with Bill O\u2019Reilly, Trump took a harder line and denied that he supported funding the group: \u201cNo, I mean a lot of people say it\u2019s an abortion clinic. I\u2019m opposed to that. And I wouldn\u2019t do any funding as long as they are performing abortions. And they are performing abortions. So I would be opposed to funding \u2014 I would be totally opposed to funding,\u201d Trump said.\n\nRubio Wrong on Illegal Immigration\n\nRubio said that illegal immigration \u201cis worse today than it was three years ago, which is worse than it was five years ago.\u201d It has remained pretty flat in that time.\n\nThere were 11.3 million people living in the U.S. illegally in 2014. That\u2019s the most recent estimate from the Pew Research Center. That is lower than the 11.5 million the center estimated were living in the U.S. illegally three years earlier in 2011, and the same as the 11.3 million in 2009.\n\nOverall, \u201c[t]his population has remained essentially stable for five years after nearly two decades of changes,\u201d Pew said in its July 2015 report.\n\nStalin Didn\u2019t Say That\n\nIn his closing statement, Carson attributed a quote to Joseph Stalin that experts say didn\u2019t come from the Soviet dictator.\n\n\u201cJoseph Stalin said if you want to bring America down you, have to undermine three things: our spiritual life, our patriotism and our morality,\u201d Carson said. \u201cWe, the people, can stop that decline, starting right here in South Carolina.\u201d\n\nThe Internet myth-busters at Snopes.com looked into the quote when it made the rounds as a Facebook meme (the exact quote attributed to Stalin then was, \u201cAmerica is like a healthy body and its resistance is threefold: its patriotism, its morality, and its spiritual life. If we can undermine these three areas, America will collapse from within.\u201d). Snopes searched collections of Stalin\u2019s speeches, writings, interviews and other statements and was unable to turn up any reference to that quote. Snopes also noted that none of the numerous citations on the Internet referenced a verifiable source for the quote.\n\nAfter the debate, we reached out to David Brandenberger, an associate professor of history and international studies at the University of Richmond, who has written extensively about Stalin, and he told us the quote is bogus.\n\n\u201cIndeed, the only thing more remarkable than Carson quoting Stalin at the debate was that he attributed to him a made-up quotation,\u201d Brandenberger told us via email. \u201cOf course, Stalin is often credited with apocryphal statements (\u2018Death is the solution to all problems. No man \u2013 no problem,\u2019 etc.), but that doesn\u2019t excuse Carson tonight.\u201d\n\nStanford history professor Norman Naimark, who holds the Robert and Florence McDonnell Chair in East European History and wrote \u201cStalin\u2019s Genocides,\u201d told us he has never heard of that quote from Stalin either. \u201cI suspect Carson made it up, but I don\u2019t know for sure,\u201d Naimark told us.\n\nTrump/Bush on Eminent Domain\n\nTrump and Bush once again argued over New Jersey\u2019s failed attempts to use eminent domain to benefit a Trump casino project in Atlantic City. But, in defending himself, Trump misrepresented the case.\n\nTrump falsely claimed that the eminent domain case \u201cwasn\u2019t for a parking lot,\u201d but rather for \u201ca very large tower\u201d that would \u201cemploy thousands.\u201d But the eminent domain case was for a parking lot. A \u201cvery large tower\u201d was not part of the condemnation proceedings, but there was a proposed hotel renovation that would have been accomplished through a private sale.\n\nTrump: When Jeb had said, \u201cYou used eminent domain privately for a parking lot.\u201d It wasn\u2019t for a parking lot. The state of New Jersey \u2014 too bad Chris Christie is not here, he could tell you \u2014 the state of New Jersey went to build a very large tower that was going to employ thousands of people. I mean, it was going to really do a big job in terms of economic development.\n\nHere are the facts, as we have reported once before: The state Casino Reinvestment Development Authority attempted to condemn three parcels of land in Atlantic City as part of a $28.6 million hotel project proposed by Trump Plaza Associates. The properties were owned separately by three families with the last names Banin, Coking and Sabatini.\n\nHere\u2019s how a state court judge, in ruling against the state and Trump in 1998, described Trump\u2019s proposal and the three properties that the state wanted to condemn to complete it:\n\nCasino Reinvestment Development Authority v. Banin, July 20, 1998: Trump\u2019s project called for the redevelopment of the city block abutting the boardwalk between the Trump Plaza Hotel-Casino and Caesars Hotel-Casino. The block was located in the Corridor Area which was an area previously identified by CRDA for redevelopment. The site was occupied by the former Holiday Inn Hotel, the rusting steel structure of the aborted Penthouse Hotel-Casino project, some undeveloped lots and a few private residences and small businesses. Included within the site were the properties of defendants Banin, Coking and Sabatini. Trump\u2019s project proposed creation of a 361-room hotel by rehabilitation of the Holiday Inn building; removal of the dilapidated Penthouse steel structure; construction of surface parking and a driveway bisecting the block from Missouri Avenue to the entrance of the Trump Plaza Hotel; and creation of a park or privately-owned landscaped area along Pacific Avenue. The project also called for construction of a two-story porte-cochere at the Trump Plaza entrance spanning Columbia Place, the public street between Trump Plaza and the site, as well as linkage of the renovated hotel to Trump Plaza by way of a sky bridge over Columbia Place near the Boardwalk.\n\nSuperior Court Judge Richard Williams wrote in his opinion that the \u201cparcels in the area proposed for the driveway, surface parking, and the landscaped park area were held by other owners. Because Trump had previously been unable to acquire these privately-owned parcels, CRDA was requested to use its power of eminent domain for their acquisition.\u201d\n\nWilliams wrote that under Trump\u2019s plan \u201cCoking\u2019s property [would] be blacktopped and used for surface parking and Banin and Sabatini\u2019s properties would be planted with grass and used for a park or green space.\u201d\n\nIt was Vera Coking who was featured in a Cruz ad attacking Trump for seeking to bulldoze Coking\u2019s home \u201cfor a limousine parking lot for his casino.\u201d As the Philadelphia Inquirerreported in 1998, Trump proposed \u201ca limousine waiting area\u201d on Coking\u2019s property.\n\nSo, while Trump can make the argument that his project would have created jobs, he cannot say that the eminent domain case \u201cwasn\u2019t for a parking lot.\u201d It was for a parking lot and public park to complete the project.\n\nDid Trump Call McCain a \u2018Loser\u2019?\n\nIn a pointed exchange, Bush claimed Trump once called Sen. John McCain a \u201closer because he was a P.O.W.\u201d Trump called McCain a loser, but not because he was a prisoner of war. He called him a \u201closer\u201d because he lost the 2008 presidential election to Barack Obama.\n\nIn the debate, Bush said, \u201cAnd, it\u2019s really weak to call John McCain a loser because he was a P.O.W.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never called him \u2014 I don\u2019t call him,\u201d Trump responded.\n\n\u201cThat is outrageous,\u201d Bush continued. \u201cThe guy\u2019s an American hero.\u201d\n\nThere are two Trump quotes in question here. And Bush was conflating them.\n\nAt the Family Leadership Summit in Ames, Iowa, in July, Trump said of McCain, \u201cHe\u2019s not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d In comments to the media after his speech, Trump seemed to walk that back a bit, saying, \u201cIf somebody\u2019s a prisoner, I consider them a war hero.\u201d\n\nIn the same speech, Trump also took a shot at McCain for losing the 2008 presidential race to Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cHe lost,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe let us down. I never liked him as much after that because I don\u2019t like losers.\u201d\n\nGDP Growth\n\nTrump claimed that the nation\u2019s economy \u201cdidn\u2019t grow\u201d in the last quarter. It did grow, although fourth-quarter growth was weak.\n\nTrump: We have an economy that last quarter, GDP didn\u2019t grow. It was flat. We have to make our economy grow again.\n\nIn a Jan. 29 press release, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said the nation\u2019s gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 0.7% in the fourth quarter of 2015. For the year, the U.S. economy grew by 2.4% \u2014 the same as 2014, BEA said.\n\nNot Entirely Self-Funded\n\nTrump repeated his claim that he is a \u201cself-funder\u201d when it comes to funding his campaign. Not completely, he isn\u2019t.\n\nTrump\u2019s presidential campaign received $19.4 million in 2015, according to Trump\u2019s year-end filing with the Federal Election Commission in January. Trump loaned his campaign $12.6 million of that amount, and he made additional in-kind contributions of $219,000. So, nearly 66% of the campaign\u2019s money has come from Trump. The other 34%, or $6.5 million, has come from individual donors.\n\nWe should also note that since Trump has loaned that money to his campaign, rather than donating it, he could potentially get it back. The individual donations that the campaign has received are enough to cover about half of the campaign\u2019s $12.4 million in spending as of Dec. 31, 2015.\n\nIt\u2019s Groundhog Day All Over Again\n\nGroundhog Day was less than two weeks ago, but watching the Republican debate felt a bit like that for us at FactCheck.org \u2014 we have seen many of the same misleading claims crop up again and again. Here are some of the repeat claims we heard:\n\n\u2022 Cruz: \u201cThe business flat tax that is in my tax plan is not a VAT [Value-Added Tax]. A VAT in Europe is a sales tax.\u201d As we wrote when this came up during the sixth Republican debate, the nonpartisan, business-funded Tax Foundation has described the Cruz proposal as a \u201csubtraction method value-added tax,\u201d and the conservative National Review also describes it as a VAT.\n\n\u2022 Bush: \u201cThe Cato Institute, which grades governors based on their spending, rank [Kasich] right at the bottom.\u201d We wrote about this recently after ads from the pro-Bush super PAC Right to Rise cited Cato Institute\u2019s 2014 \u201cFiscal Policy Report Card on America\u2019s Governors,\u201d in which it gave Kasich an overall \u201cD\u201d rating and rated him worst among all governors on spending. We noted that the rating is based on data about Ohio\u2019s general revenue fund spending, but the nonpartisan group that published the data warned that the figures for Ohio were skewed, for state comparison purposes, due to accounting methods employed by the state for Medicaid expenditures.\n\n\u2022 Bush: \u201cWe led the nation in job growth seven out of eight years\u201d when he was governor of Florida. Bush has twisted jobs data a few different ways during the campaign, and this time his campaign says he is referring to the total number of jobs created in the last seven years of his governorship. As we noted last June, Florida gained more net jobs than any other state, regardless of size, in three of the eight years Bush was governor. But when it comes to the rate of job growth \u2014 which factors in the size of the state\u2019s job market \u2013 Florida ranked fifth over the entire eight years of Bush\u2019s two terms.\n\n\u2022 Cruz: \u201cMarco [Rubio] went on Univision in Spanish and said he would not rescind President Obama\u2019s illegal executive amnesty on his first day in office.\u201d As we explained when Cruz made a similar charge on two Sunday talk shows on Jan. 31, Rubio said he wouldn\u2019t immediately revoke Obama\u2019s 2012 order protecting so-called \u201cDreamers\u201d \u2014 young people brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents \u2014 though he said it would have to end \u201cat some point.\u201d But Rubio has said he would revoke Obama\u2019s 2014 executive action that protects as many as 5 million adults from deportation.\n\n\u2022 Rubio: \u201cAnd here is the truth, Ted Cruz supported legalizing people that were in this country illegally.\u201d We\u2019ve covered this one repeatedly, as it has come up in multiple debates. We covered the issue in detail after the fifth Republican debate, and the gist of it is that Cruz offered an amendment to a Senate immigration bill to strip it of a path to citizenship \u2014 although it would have left open the possibility of legalization. Cruz spoke many times in favor of his amendment, advocating its passage, but Cruz\u2019s campaign says that was a political bluff to show that the real aim of the bill\u2019s supporters was a path to citizenship, and that he never actually supported legalization.\n\n\u2022 Carson: \u201cYou know, when you consider how much regulations cost us each year, you know? $2 trillion dollars per family, $24,000 per family.\u201d We last wrote about this when then Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry said in February 2015 that the cost of government regulation \u201chits American families for $15,000 a year.\u201d That figure comes from a conservative group\u2019s admitted \u201cback-of-the-envelope\u201d calculation of estimated regulatory costs that does not include any potential savings. The Competitive Enterprise Institute has released a newer version of the report cited by Perry, but the same shortcomings apply.\n\n\u2022 Rubio: \u201cWell, first of all, I think amnesty is the forgiveness of a wrongdoing without consequence and that \u2014 I\u2019ve never supported that.\u201d We wrote about Rubio\u2019s evolution on immigration, as well as his evolving definition of amnesty back in 2013. In that story, we noted that in 2011, Rubio derided an \u201cearned path to citizenship\u201d as another word for \u201camnesty.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Kasich: \u201cWe have grown the number of jobs by 400,000 private-sector jobs since I\u2019ve been governor.\u201d As we wrote when Kasich made a similar boast in the seventh GOP debate, Ohio has, in fact, gained 400,700 private-sector jobs under Kasich. Still, Ohio\u2019s private-sector job growth rate of 9.3% during Kasich\u2019s tenure lags behind the national private-sector growth rate of 11.7%.\n\nFor a full list of sources, see FactCheck.org.\n\nMore coverage of the GOP debate:\n\nTop takeaways from the South Carolina GOP debate\n\nNinth GOP debate: Highlights from South Carolina\n\nGOP hopefuls at debate react to Scalia death\n\nRubio challenges Cruz on immigration, says he doesn't speak Spanish\n\nTrump, Jeb Bush clash over George W.
