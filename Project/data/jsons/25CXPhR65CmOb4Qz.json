''\nAlthough she was the only member of her immediate family not to run for Congress , Roberts considered her role as a journalist and political analyst as her way of giving back .\n`` I do feel strongly that informing the voters about what 's going on , trying to explain it in ways that people can understand , and putting the issues out there is a form of participation , '' Roberts told KET .\nPolitical journalist George Will , who worked with Roberts on ABC 's This Week , said Roberts was not just born to the political class but was a natural inhabitant .\n`` She liked people on both sides of the aisle and had friends on both sides of the aisle , '' Will told NPR . `` If you do n't like the game of politics , I do n't see how you write about it well , '' he said . `` She liked the game of politics and she understood that it was a game .

She was also a regular fill-in anchor for Ted Koppel on Nightline . From 1992 to 2002 , Roberts co-anchored ABC News ' Sunday morning show This Week alongside Sam Donaldson .\nWill said that although Washington is a `` town of short leases , '' with people constantly coming and going , Roberts represented the permanent Washington , a kind of figure who was constant through decades of political change : `` The Washington not often denounced by people who denounce Washington because they do n't know it exists , '' Will said . `` Cokie represented the durable , ongoing Washington that is a custodian of the manners of the city and the sociability of the city that makes it really function .
