    "content": "Most Democrats in the House of Representatives joined every Republican to prevent a vote on impeaching President Donald Trump Wednesday .\nUsing a procedural tactic known as a privileged resolution , Rep. Al Green ( D-TX ) forced the House to take action on articles of impeachment \u2014 something Democratic leaders opposed .\nBut the House did not directly vote on whether Trump should be impeached . The vote was instead about whether Green \u2019 s impeachment resolution should be set aside ( \u201c tabled \u201d ) , as leaders of both parties wanted .\nA \u201c yea \u201d vote meant shelving impeachment for now ( though not necessarily forever ) . A \u201c no \u201d vote would have meant keeping Green \u2019 s resolution on the House floor and proceeding to an actual vote on impeaching Trump .\nAs expected , though , Republicans and most Democrats came together to vote \u201c yes , \u201d tabling the measure , 332-95 . The overall split in the Democratic Party : 137 voted to table and 95 voted against doing so .\nGreen \u2019 s move was a response to Trump \u2019 s racist tweets from Sunday , when the president wrote that \u201c \u2018 Progressive \u2019 Democrat Congresswomen \u201d who came from \u201c corrupt \u201d countries should \u201c go back \u201d where they came from . The tweet appeared to refer to Reps. Ilhan Omar ( D-MN ) , Rashida Tlaib ( D-MI ) , Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D-NY ) , and Ayanna Pressley ( D-MA ) .\nBut even the dozens of Democrats who have spent months calling for Trump \u2019 s impeachment aren \u2019 t necessarily on board with Green \u2019 s tactics here . Politico \u2019 s Kyle Cheney and Andrew Desiderio reported that some of these Democrats feared Green \u2019 s \u201c rogue move \u201d would end up flopping and hurting their overall effort to build support . Meanwhile , as \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Ella Nilsen has been tracking , a lot of Democrats are more comfortable calling for an \u201c impeachment inquiry \u201d than straight-up impeachment .\nOrdinarily , House leadership has tight control over what actually gets to the floor to be voted on by the whole chamber . But there are a few rarely used exceptions to this ( such as a discharge petition , where a majority of the House \u2019 s members can force a floor vote on something stuck in committee ) .\nAnother exception is what \u2019 s known as raising a \u201c question of privilege. \u201d As Megan Lynch wrote in a Congressional Research Service report , this is \u201c a formal declaration by a Member of the House asserting that a situation has arisen affecting \u2018 the rights of the House collectively , its safety , dignity and the integrity of its proceedings. \u2019 \u201d ( It \u2019 s often referred to in shorthand as a \u201c privileged motion \u201d or \u201c privileged resolution . \u201d )\nBasically , this is a special measure that takes priority over everything else the House can do ( except a motion to adjourn ) . Once it is raised by a member ( and ruled valid by the speaker ) , floor action must occur on it within two legislative days .\nImpeachment resolutions can be pushed to the floor through a question of privilege , according to ample past precedent . During George W. Bush \u2019 s presidency , then-Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D-OH ) used this tactic for impeachment articles against Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney . During Obama \u2019 s presidency , Rep. Jim Jordan ( R-OH ) used it for pushing impeachment of then-IRS Commissioner John Koskinen .\nThere is , however , a catch : This tactic can not force an up-or-down vote on the impeachment articles themselves .\nThat \u2019 s because what generally happens in response is that a motion to table \u2014 that is , to kill \u2014 the privileged motion \u2014 is brought . That vote is the first one to happen , and it usually succeeds . ( This can also be done with a measure to refer the privileged motion to a committee . )\nGreen has already done this twice \u2014 under Republican control\nThis is actually the third time Green has forced a procedural vote on impeaching Trump , though it \u2019 s the first since Democrats took over the House .\nIn 2017 , Green argued after the violence at the \u201c Unite the Right \u201d rally in Charlottesville , Virginia , that Trump should be impeached for his \u201c record of inciting white supremacy , sexism , bigotry , hatred , xenophobia , race-baiting , and racism . \u201d\nTrump saying there were \u201c very fine people \u201d among white supremacist protesters in Charlottesville\nTrump \u2019 s travel ban , which Green said incited \u201c hate and hostility \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s criticism of NFL players who knelt during the national anthem\nTrump casting \u201c contempt on Puerto Rican citizens \u201d after Hurricane Maria\nThen in December 2017 , Green used the privileged motion tactic to force his impeachment articles to the floor of the Republican-controlled House .\nThe GOP responded with a motion to table , which easily carried .
