And then he delivered the line that raised eyebrows across the political universe and incensed his top competitor for the Democratic presidential nomination .\n\u201c I think Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that , you know , Richard Nixon did not and in a way that Bill Clinton did not . \u201d\nThen-Senator Obama was , in essence , offering himself up as the Democratic answer to President Reagan , someone who sensed Americans \u2019 readiness for a new direction and then \u201c put us on a fundamentally different path , \u201d as Obama put it .\nNow , 6-1/2 years into Obama \u2019 s presidency , the outlines of his legacy are clear : a major health reform that has added millions to insurance rolls , a recovering economy , Wall Street reform , a national right to same-sex marriage , diplomatic relations with Cuba , a nuclear deal with Iran , enhanced workers ' rights , and aggressive new rules to combat climate change .\nAdd to that the rise of the Islamic State group and expanded use of drones to kill terror suspects overseas , two more legacy items that are less points of pride than challenges Obama will hand his successor .\nThen there \u2019 s the racial turmoil of the past few years , and the national conversation it has sparked \u2013 a conversation that Obama , as the first black US president , has been uniquely positioned to participate in and often lead . That moment in June when he sang \u201c Amazing Grace \u201d at the funeral of the Rev . Clementa Pinckney will go down as a transcendent moment in his presidency .\nThe idea , in early 2008 , that Obama wasn \u2019 t offering himself as \u201c a singular figure \u201d now seems disingenuous , at least on racial matters . Almost by definition , the first African-American president is a transformative president .\nYet Obama is also defying some of the paralyzing pitfalls of a second term \u2013 at least so far . As recently as a year ago , he was shunned by members of his own party going into the midterm elections . He was considered a radioactive presence on the campaign trail , and pundits were calling him one of the weakest presidents in the postwar era .\nNow , suddenly , he \u2019 s cutting nuclear deals , ending decades of animosity with Caribbean communists , forging far-reaching trade pacts , and soothing the nation on the crucible of race .\nWhile many people virulently oppose most of these initiatives , no one can accuse him of succumbing to lame-duck status . Even though Republicans control both houses of Congress , Obama has put them on the defensive , forcing them to try to muster veto-proof majorities and go to court to block his initiatives .\nAll of which raises the deeper question of whether Obama will go down in history as a transformational , Reaganesque leader who has changed the overall direction of the nation . For now , it might be premature to anoint him into the kingdom of Gipper-Dem .\n\u201c Will Obama become the poster child of the Democratic left , the way Reagan has become the Republican poster child , especially for conservatives ? \u201d says presidential historian Robert Dallek . \u201c That might be the case . But it so depends on what comes next . \u201d\nJust as Reagan was succeeded by a member of his own party \u2013 his vice president , George H.W . Bush , who continued his policies , albeit under the banner of \u201c kinder and gentler \u201d \u2013 so , too , does the scope of Obama \u2019 s legacy depend on the election of a Democrat in 2016 . Start with the fact that the next president is likely to nominate one or more Supreme Court justices .\nThen comes Obama \u2019 s aggressive use of executive power . It has allowed him to defer deportation for some undocumented immigrants , enact sweeping new climate-change rules , and go bold on foreign policy . The downside , for Obama , is that the next president could undo his actions , though as then-senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer told The Huffington Post last year , \u201c in politics , it \u2019 s possible to deny people things . It \u2019 s almost impossible to take things away from them . \u201d\nState-led court challenges , too , could thwart his immigration and climate-change initiatives .\nIn 2016 , most important to Democrats \u2019 prospects of holding onto the White House is the economy . Obama took office amid a full-blown economic crisis , passed the biggest stimulus bill in history , and has presided over a slow but steady recovery . Unemployment has been cut nearly in half \u2013 from 10 percent in late 2009 to 5.1 percent today . The stock market has roughly doubled under Obama , even with the recent drop . Economic growth has been middling , but at least it \u2019 s in positive territory .\nHow much credit Obama deserves is a matter of great debate . Conservatives say his policies have impeded the recovery , and they point with alarm to the federal government \u2019 s spiraling debt , now more than $ 18 trillion .\nBut for Obama and his team , winning a second term meant owning the bragging rights of an improved economy \u2013 and a chance to change the paradigm from the Reagan-era economic policies of less government and lower taxes .\n\u201c We have been battling that conception , and Democrats were forced to play on that field for a very long time , \u201d Mr. Pfeiffer said in December . \u201c We want to change the field . \u201d\nIn his State of the Union address last January , a liberated Obama \u2013 now past his last midterm election \u2013 declared that \u201c the shadow of crisis \u201d had passed and laid out a bold ( and expensive ) domestic agenda aimed at boosting the middle class . He called for free community college tuition , tax cuts for working families , guaranteed paid sick leave and maternity leave , and higher taxes on the wealthy and large financial institutions .\nWith Congress firmly in Republican hands for the rest of his presidency , Obama wasn \u2019 t laying out actionable proposals , he was being the anti-Reagan . He was \u201c changing the field \u201d \u2013 and setting the stage for the 2016 presidential race .\nImagine if candidate Obama had praised Reagan in a debate with Sen. John McCain , Obama \u2019 s Republican opponent in 2008 .\n\u201c I knew Ronald Reagan .... Senator , you \u2019 re no Ronald Reagan , \u201d Senator McCain could have said , echoing one of the all-time best debate put-downs in American history .\n\u201c Obama as the Democrats \u2019 Reagan \u201d didn \u2019 t become part of his campaign rhetoric . But soon after taking office in 2009 , Obama came back to the theme of \u201c transformative presidencies \u201d in a private dinner with historians . Reagan came up , as did the Roosevelts , Woodrow Wilson , and Harry Truman , according to a participant .\nMore recently , Obama invoked Reagan \u2019 s name when he took to the Rose Garden to tout the preliminary deal with Iran aimed at preventing the country from obtaining a nuclear weapon .\n\u201c The American people remember that at the height of the cold war , presidents like Nixon and Reagan struck historic arms-\ncontrol agreements with the Soviet Union , a far more dangerous adversary , \u201d the president said in April .\n\u201c When a liberal invokes Ronald Reagan \u2019 s name to defend a specific policy , it is almost certain to be a policy Reagan would never have defended , \u201d writes Tom Nichols , a professor of national security affairs at the US Naval War College , in a column in The National Interest .\nObama \u2019 s Iran deal isn \u2019 t analogous to Reagan \u2019 s Soviet deal , Professor Nichols argues , because the Soviet Union was enfeebled economically , and had given up its ideology , which Iran has not . And , he says , the verification regime the Soviets agreed to was substantially stricter than the Iran deal .\nThat analysis addresses a specific policy matter . But the larger question of whether Obama becomes the Democrats \u2019 Reagan may take years , or even decades , to answer . Obama would have to embody what it means to be a Democrat and help define and shape Democratic politics for a generation , says Andra Gillespie , a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta .\n\u201c That \u2019 s the extent of being the standard , \u201d says Professor Gillespie . \u201c And I \u2019 m not sure , when people define the politics of this era , that Obama will stand out as the singular figurehead , in the way Republicans hold Reagan in that high regard . \u201d\nOne issue is how Obama positioned himself within the Democratic Party from the beginning . When he ran for president , he wasn \u2019 t a \u201c movement \u201d candidate in the way Reagan was . Obama saw himself as \u201c an individual phenomenon , above partisan politics , \u201d says Robert Borosage , cofounder of the liberal group Campaign for America \u2019 s Future .\nAs president , Obama has balanced the progressive and moderate wings of the Democratic Party , leading to criticism from the left that he hasn \u2019 t gone far enough . The party \u2019 s liberal standard-bearer is Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D ) of Massachusetts . In the presidential race , Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I ) of Vermont , a self-described social democrat , is the liberal darling .\nBut the favorite to win the Democratic nod is former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton . She comes out of her husband \u2019 s centrist Democratic tradition but has tacked to the left in her second run for the presidency \u2013 a reflection of the times . Since 1992 , the year Bill Clinton won the White House , the portion of Americans who self-identify as \u201c liberal \u201d has risen seven percentage points to a record 24 percent , according to Gallup .\nIf Mrs. Clinton wins the presidency on a \u201c progressive , inequality agenda , and makes the argument for public investment , then we \u2019 ll see Obama as the beginning of a progressive era , \u201d says Mr. Borosage . \u201c But if she tacks back to the center , we will know that we haven \u2019 t entered into a different world . \u201d\nHere \u2019 s another test in the great Obama-versus-Reagan smack down : Has Obama created a majority coalition that elects other people ? And has he created a language and a philosophy about government that represents a transformation from the conservative era ?\nIn presidential election years , at least , Obama has forged a majority coalition . Just as Reagan pulled Christian conservatives into Republican politics and turned working-class voters into Reagan Democrats , Obama has presided over the creation of the so-called rising American electorate \u2013 young voters , people of color , and single women . If they turn out in big enough numbers next year , they can elect a Democratic successor .\nOn the question of governing philosophy , Obama is on shakier ground . Reagan represented a sharp departure from New Deal-Great Society policies with his turn toward smaller government and lower taxes . Obama came in seeking to revitalize progressivism , but he also cast himself as a post-partisan leader and seemed determined , especially after Democrats lost control of the House , to cut deals with Republicans . Talk of entitlement reform , including cuts to benefits , frustrated liberals .\nReagan frustrated his own political base at times as well by raising taxes more than once and opting to address the annual antiabortion march by telephone , not in person . But conservatives knew on a fundamental level that he was with them .\n\u201c If you \u2019 re going to be a transformative president , you \u2019 ve got to set a course and stay with it and convince Americans about it , \u201d says Borosage . \u201c If you \u2019 re twisting and turning , Americans get lost . \u201d\nReagan \u2019 s embrace of supply-side economics \u2013 lower taxes , smaller government \u2013 coupled with increased military spending came to be known as Reaganomics . Nobody today is talking about \u201c Obamanomics \u201d for a reason .\nEven on the stunning rise of public support for same-sex marriage in recent years , Obama wasn \u2019 t leading the crusade . He now speaks of gay marriage as a civil right , but announced his support only in 2012 .\nObama is not alone as a president who \u201c led from behind \u201d on a major social issue . President Wilson signed women \u2019 s suffrage into law , but wasn \u2019 t at the forefront of the movement . Ditto Presidents John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson on civil rights .\n\u201c Historically , very few presidents have been leaders on social issues , \u201d says Tom Cronin , a presidential scholar at Colorado College . \u201c We elect presidents and congresses that are slow to embrace change . \u201d\nAs soon as Obama won reelection , the speculation began . Would the \u201c second-term curse \u201d bite ? Second terms , after all , are when scandals burst forth \u2013 Watergate , Iran-contra , Monica Lewinsky . The big , first-term initiatives have played out , and the four-year slide into lame-duckery kicks in .\nThe second half of this analysis is false . Scandals do hit in the second term ( often from seeds planted in the first ) , but in the cases of Reagan and Clinton , they didn \u2019 t prevent second-term accomplishments . Reagan secured an arms-control treaty with the Soviet Union , immigration reform , and tax reform all in his second term . Clinton signed the Balanced Budget Act , achieved peace in Northern Ireland , and facilitated the Dayton Peace Accords on former Yugoslavia .\nA major scandal also doesn \u2019 t mean death in the polls . Reagan recovered after Iran-contra and left office with a 63 percent job approval rating , according to Gallup . Clinton survived impeachment and left office with the highest approval rating of any US president since the advent of polling , at 66 percent in a Gallup survey .\nObama took office at 66 percent approval , but drifted down to earth , only rising above 50 percent long enough to win reelection . His average job approval score for the duration of his presidency to date \u2013 47 percent in Gallup polls \u2013 is below the average for US presidents . But he is governing in times of intense partisan polarization and high unease about the future of the nation . Stagnant wages and the threat of Islamic State are top concerns .\nOne of Obama \u2019 s roughest patches in office came just four months into his second term . Questions about the government \u2019 s response to the Sept. 11 , 2012 , attacks on the US mission in Benghazi , Libya , dogged the administration . The Internal Revenue Service admitted to targeting conservative groups for extra scrutiny . The Justice Department was caught secretly accessing reporters \u2019 phone records .\nTwo years later , Obama has never seemed more confident as president .\n\u201c I finally know what I \u2019 m doing ? \u201d he quipped to \u201c Daily Show \u201d host Jon Stewart , who ticked off recent accomplishments , including hard-fought congressional passage of \u201c fast track \u201d trade authority and the negotiation of the Iran deal .\n\u201c I tell you , there \u2019 s no doubt that you get better as you go along , \u201d Obama added . Obama has also made clear that he \u2019 s been playing the \u201c long game \u201d from the start , and counted on winning two terms .\n\u201c A lot of the work that we did early starts bearing fruit later , \u201d he told Mr. Stewart . \u201c And it just so happened over the last couple of months , that people are seeing some of the work that we started way back when I first came in . \u201d\nMuch remains on Obama \u2019 s presidential \u201c bucket list. \u201d His campaign pledge to close the US prison camp at Guant\u00e1namo Bay , Cuba , remains unfulfilled . The administration has pledged to submit a plan to Congress after the August recess .\nAn initiative with rare bipartisan , bicameral support \u2013 and therefore , potential for success \u2013 is reform of the criminal-justice system , an issue of particular importance in the black community . Planned legislation would narrow mandatory minimum prison sentences for drug crimes and divert nonviolent first-time offenders to probation and treatment . This initiative is key to Obama \u2019 s legacy as the first African-American president . So is his recently announced plan to tackle racial desegregation in the suburbs .\nThe United Nations-sponsored climate conference in Paris in December is another legacy item . As the president told Stewart , he hopes to get China and India on board with a binding , global agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .\nThe administration has promised an up-or-down decision on the controversial Keystone XL pipeline before Obama leaves office . But other agenda items \u2013 comprehensive immigration reform , gun control , a higher federal minimum wage , universal pre-K , free community college tuition \u2013 require congressional approval , and are going nowhere .\nThen there \u2019 s the question of Obama \u2019 s post-presidency . Unlike Reagan , Obama will be a young ex-president . And he has certainly promised big things , including continued devotion to his My Brother \u2019 s Keeper initiative , which aims to help boys and young men of color lead productive lives . Africa , particularly his father \u2019 s native Kenya , promises to be a special focus , too .\nThere are also signs that Obama \u2019 s nonprofit grass-roots organization , Organizing for Action \u2013 which promotes the president \u2019 s policies and trains community organizers \u2013 will endure after he leaves office , says Sidney Milkis , a political scientist at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville , who has studied OFA .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox . By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy\nProfessor Milkis cites the group \u2019 s continued fundraising and suggests OFA could be instrumental in cementing the president \u2019 s legacy after he leaves office . \u201c With 30 million e-mails , they amplify his voice and give him a presence in communities , \u201d he says .\nThe idea of Obama going back to his roots as a community organizer may not be all that far-fetched . That , plus staying active in My Brother \u2019 s Keeper ( and making high-priced speeches ) could make for a full life after the White House . \u201c With his organization and relative youth , Obama could have a post-presidency that might be as significant in some ways as his presidency , \u201d says Robert C. Smith , a political scientist at San Francisco State University .",

He now speaks of gay marriage as a civil right, but announced his support only in 2012.\n\nObama is not alone as a president who \u201cled from behind\u201d on a major social issue. President Wilson signed women\u2019s suffrage into law, but wasn\u2019t at the forefront of the movement. Ditto Presidents John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson on civil rights.\n\n\u201cHistorically, very few presidents have been leaders on social issues,\u201d says Tom Cronin, a presidential scholar at Colorado College. \u201cWe elect presidents and congresses that are slow to embrace change.\u201d\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nAs soon as Obama won reelection, the speculation began. Would the \u201csecond-term curse\u201d bite? Second terms, after all, are when scandals burst forth \u2013 Watergate, Iran-contra, Monica Lewinsky. The big, first-term initiatives have played out, and the four-year slide into lame-duckery kicks in.\n\nThe second half of this analysis is false. Scandals do hit in the second term (often from seeds planted in the first), but in the cases of Reagan and Clinton, they didn\u2019t prevent second-term accomplishments. Reagan secured an arms-control treaty with the Soviet Union, immigration reform, and tax reform all in his second term. Clinton signed the Balanced Budget Act, achieved peace in Northern Ireland, and facilitated the Dayton Peace Accords on former Yugoslavia.\n\nA major scandal also doesn\u2019t mean death in the polls. Reagan recovered after Iran-contra and left office with a 63 percent job approval rating, according to Gallup. Clinton survived impeachment and left office with the highest approval rating of any US president since the advent of polling, at 66 percent in a Gallup survey.\n\nObama took office at 66 percent approval, but drifted down to earth, only rising above 50 percent long enough to win reelection. His average job approval score for the duration of his presidency to date \u2013 47 percent in Gallup polls \u2013 is below the average for US presidents. But he is governing in times of intense partisan polarization and high unease about the future of the nation. Stagnant wages and the threat of Islamic State are top concerns.\n\nOne of Obama\u2019s roughest patches in office came just four months into his second term. Questions about the government\u2019s response to the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks on the US mission in Benghazi, Libya, dogged the administration. The Internal Revenue Service admitted to targeting conservative groups for extra scrutiny. The Justice Department was caught secretly accessing reporters\u2019 phone records.\n\nTwo years later, Obama has never seemed more confident as president.\n\n\u201cI finally know what I\u2019m doing?\u201d he quipped to \u201cDaily Show\u201d host Jon Stewart, who ticked off recent accomplishments, including hard-fought congressional passage of \u201cfast track\u201d trade authority and the negotiation of the Iran deal.\n\n\u201cI tell you, there\u2019s no doubt that you get better as you go along,\u201d Obama added. Obama has also made clear that he\u2019s been playing the \u201clong game\u201d from the start, and counted on winning two terms.\n\n\u201cA lot of the work that we did early starts bearing fruit later,\u201d he told Mr. Stewart. \u201cAnd it just so happened over the last couple of months, that people are seeing some of the work that we started way back when I first came in.\u201d\n\nMuch remains on Obama\u2019s presidential \u201cbucket list.\u201d His campaign pledge to close the US prison camp at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, remains unfulfilled. The administration has pledged to submit a plan to Congress after the August recess.\n\nAn initiative with rare bipartisan, bicameral support \u2013 and therefore, potential for success \u2013 is reform of the criminal-justice system, an issue of particular importance in the black community. Planned legislation would narrow mandatory minimum prison sentences for drug crimes and divert nonviolent first-time offenders to probation and treatment. This initiative is key to Obama\u2019s legacy as the first African-American president. So is his recently announced plan to tackle racial desegregation in the suburbs.\n\nThe United Nations-sponsored climate conference in Paris in December is another legacy item. As the president told Stewart, he hopes to get China and India on board with a binding, global agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe administration has promised an up-or-down decision on the controversial Keystone XL pipeline before Obama leaves office. But other agenda items \u2013 comprehensive immigration reform, gun control, a higher federal minimum wage, universal pre-K, free community college tuition \u2013 require congressional approval, and are going nowhere.\n\nThen there\u2019s the question of Obama\u2019s post-presidency. Unlike Reagan, Obama will be a young ex-president. And he has certainly promised big things, including continued devotion to his My Brother\u2019s Keeper initiative, which aims to help boys and young men of color lead productive lives. Africa, particularly his father\u2019s native Kenya, promises to be a special focus, too.\n\nThere are also signs that Obama\u2019s nonprofit grass-roots organization, Organizing for Action \u2013 which promotes the president\u2019s policies and trains community organizers \u2013 will endure after he leaves office, says Sidney Milkis, a political scientist at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, who has studied OFA.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy\n\nProfessor Milkis cites the group\u2019s continued fundraising and suggests OFA could be instrumental in cementing the president\u2019s legacy after he leaves office. \u201cWith 30 million e-mails, they amplify his voice and give him a presence in communities,\u201d he says.\n\nThe idea of Obama going back to his roots as a community organizer may not be all that far-fetched. That, plus staying active in My Brother\u2019s Keeper (and making high-priced speeches) could make for a full life after the White House. \u201cWith his organization and relative youth, Obama could have a post-presidency that might be as significant in some ways as his presidency,\u201d says Robert C. Smith, a political scientist at San Francisco State University.",
