President Trump \u2019 s transportation secretary , Elaine Chao , and her husband , Senator Mitch McConnell , are being accused of having profited from their commercial ties to Beijing . In 2004 , the two had a net worth of about $ 3.1 million , according to public disclosures . Three years later , the range was $ 3.1 million to $ 12.7 million . The next year , their net worth rocketed to $ 7.3 million to $ 33.1 million .\nWhat changed ? In 2008 , Ms. Chao \u2019 s father , James Chao , gave the couple a \u201c gift \u201d of $ 5 million to $ 25 million ( politicians are required to report money in ranges , not exact amounts ) . Certainly , their wealth has continued to grow .\nMr. Chao \u2019 s generosity was made possible by the fortune he has amassed through his shipping company , Foremost Group , which has thrived in large part because of its close ties with the Chinese government . In late 1993 , Mr. Chao and his son-in-law , Mr. McConnell , traveled to China as guests of the state-owned shipyard conglomerate and military contractor , China State Shipbuilding Corporation . There they met with an old classmate of Mr. Chao \u2019 s , the former Chinese president Jiang Zemin .\nMr. McConnell \u2019 s once hard-line condemnations of China softened in the years to follow . For example , as The New Republic has noted , Mr. McConnell went from telling University of Louisville students that America would never forget Tiananmen Square , in the late 1980s , to hosting the Chinese ambassador at the same school several years later , even as the ambassador publicly defended the regime \u2019 s suppression of the Falun Gong .\nAll along , the Chaos continued to gain influence . Mr. McConnell \u2019 s sister-in-law , Angela Chao , and James Chao sat on the board of the holding company for China State Shipbuilding . While Elaine Chao was secretary of labor under George W.
