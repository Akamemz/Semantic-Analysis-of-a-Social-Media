The state Department of Health declined to specify details of the violations it had found .\nThe HHS Office for Civil Rights enforces federal laws banning discrimination in the provision of medical care and investigates violations of patient privacy rights .\n\u201c The allegations against Lovelace Women \u2019 s Hospital are very serious , \u201d said New Mexico Department of Health Secretary Kathyleen Kunkel . The department \u201c continues to be concerned that individuals will not access the medical care they need and are entitled to due to fear or mistrust . \u201d\nThe state and federal actions were announced after an investigation by New Mexico In Depth and \u2588\u2588\u2588 found that Lovelace had a secret policy of designating Native American women as under investigation for coronavirus based on their appearance and a list of ZIP codes , regardless of their symptoms . The ZIP code list , known informally as the \u201c Pueblos List , \u201d a reference to New Mexico \u2019 s 19 Pueblo tribes , contained ZIP codes that corresponded with tribal reservations , some of which have suffered high rates of COVID-19 outbreaks . Other tribes on the list , however , have had few cases . Ethicists have described the practice as a case of racial profiling .\nThe decision to elevate the investigation comes as hospital workers told New Mexico In Depth and \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the hospital appeared to hide documents and discourage cooperation with state investigators .\nHospital employees said documents were removed from nursing stations , including COVID-19 screening and treatment protocols . In one internal communication viewed by the news organizations , a hospital official reminded workers that they did not need to talk to the investigators and provided a short script as a sample response .\n\u201c They told us that DOH might be calling to ask us questions about the policy , and they told us we don \u2019 t have to talk to them , \u201d one clinician said . \u201c They suggested we could just not answer the phone . \u201d\nKunkel , the state \u2019 s highest-ranking public health official , said such an instruction would be a potential violation of the hospital \u2019 s operating agreement with CMS , as would removing documents with relevant information from inspectors \u2019 review . She promised the Health Department would assist federal investigators in any ongoing reviews .\nIt was not clear on Monday whether state inspectors obtained access to any documents employees said had been moved . The state \u2019 s report to CMS was not immediately released , and a state official did not immediately confirm that the hospital had given investigators all of the documents they sought . Once the hospital is notified of the findings , it will have 14 days to respond .\nA photo of the ZIP code list , known informally as the \u201c Pueblos List. \u201d ( Obtained by \u2588\u2588\u2588 and New Mexico In Depth .

She acknowledged that the hospital had screened people based on whether they lived in \u201c geographic hot spots , \u201d among other risk criteria .
