He would reply to us , and we would have to reply to his reply . There \u2019 s no end to that . It will be quite enough for us to announce that Kautsky is a traitor to the working class , and everyone will understand everything . \u201d\nThat has been the modus operandi of the left for decades . It doesn \u2019 t respond to arguments with arguments but with stigmatizing names designed to end debate . As the communications arm of the left , the media conforms perfectly to Lenin \u2019 s method . Instead of rebutting the arguments of conservatives , it has found it easier to brand them as \u201c enemies \u201d of science , women , minorities , the poor , and so on .\nWhenever editors say that they refuse to acknowledge \u201c two sides \u201d on such matters as \u201c marriage equality \u201d or Darwinism or climate change , they are paying homage to Lenin \u2019 s devious politics by shorthand . They pay homage to it whenever they substitute their opinions of the news for actual reporting of the news . Even the squabbling among journalists recently over whether or not to suspend \u201c conventional reporting \u201d in Trump \u2019 s case , or whether front-page stories should declare his misstatements \u201c lies , \u201d is a tacit acknowledgment of that politics . With Lenin , the Christiane Amanpours have no use for the peskiness of precise responses . Just call Trump a \u201c liar , \u201d their attitude goes , and \u201c everyone will understand everything . \u201d\nBut that demagogic shorthand only works as long as Republican politicians defer to it . For years journalists opined self-servingly under the guise of objectivity and got away it because Republicans were too afraid to shatter that illusion of objectivity . They permitted the media to serve as the arbiter of what qualifies as \u201c mainstream , \u201d \u201c extremist , \u201d \u201c racist , \u201d and so forth , and made sure to stay within the media-determined parameters of any discussion .\nDonald Trump has blown up that absurd arrangement and is beating the media at its own game . He labels reporters in the same way that they label him . He upends their dishonest framing of debates by treating them as what they are , liberal partisans . His exchange last week with April Ryan , a correspondent for the American Urban Radio Network , captured that perfectly . She asked him a loaded question not as a neutral reporter but as a water-carrier for the Congressional Black Caucus . So he treated her that way . \u201c I \u2019 ll tell you what , do you want to set up the meeting ? \u201d the president said to her , after she asked if he would meet with the CBC . \u201c Do you want to set up the meeting ? Are they friends of yours ? \u201d Of course , they are friends of hers and she was trying to score a partisan point for them . Had Trump not deconstructed that for the audience , her question might have done him damage . Instead , it fell flat and looked unserious .\nReporters are thrown by a president who questions them as aggressively as they question him . And they resent that he refuses to accept as \u201c facts \u201d what is nothing more than their biased interpretation of the facts .\nEverything they accuse Trump of is on display in their own coverage . One can only laugh at the eruptions of prissy sanctimony over Trump \u2019 s tweet calling reporters an \u201c enemy of the people , \u201d given the invective in which they have indulged over the last year . Having called him a despot and worse , who are they to scold anyone on intemperate language ?\nFrom ill-mannered reporters come lectures on manners . From partisans come demands for non-partisanship . Almost all of the complaints of the press can be boiled down to one demand : that its conservative targets unilaterally disarm . We fight , you surrender \u2014 that is the media \u2019 s idea of civility .\nSo expect the squeals of the media to grow in proportion to Trump \u2019 s exposure of its fraudulence . Bret Stephens and company can pompously say that Trump is an opponent of \u201c objectivity itself. \u201d But all that means is that he rejects their phony claims of objectivity and impedes their partisan wishes .
