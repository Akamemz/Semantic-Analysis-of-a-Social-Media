The moderation wasn \u2019 t great ; it took far too long to bring up the violence recently perpetrated against journalists and protesters by Trump supporters \u2014 and , shit you not , the Trump campaign itself . And absolutely nothing happened that \u2019 s likely to change an outcome which , much like death , seems more inevitable every day .\nBut listen : You don \u2019 t want to hear about the entire debate . You either chose to do something else \u2014 or worse still , you watched it for yourself . And as the current patriarch of the heirs of Drumpf said himself Thursday night , \u201c we \u2019 ve had enough of the debates \u201d already . So I \u2019 m going to spare you a play-by-play . And I \u2019 m definitely not going to tell you who \u201c won , \u201d because , really , why the hell do journalists try to do that ?\nHere \u2019 s what I \u2019 ll do instead . I \u2019 m going to focus on the one part of the debate that , in the grand scheme of things , as best I can tell \u2014 which , to be clear , is very little \u2014 matters the most . It was early , and it was ugly , and it was exactly the kind of exhibition of political cynicism and religious bigotry that President Obama calls \u201c the source of a lot of destructive acts. \u201d I \u2019 m talking about the \u201c debate \u201d over what Donald Trump said about Muslims ( all 1.6 billion of \u2018 em ) Wednesday night .\nThe quote , for those of you who were lucky enough to miss that , too :\nI think Islam hates us . There \u2019 s something there that \u2014 there \u2019 s a tremendous hatred there . There \u2019 s a tremendous hatred . We have to get to the bottom of it . There \u2019 s an unbelievable hatred of us\u2026 . [ W ] e have to be very vigilant , we have to be very careful and we can \u2019 t allow people coming into this country who have this hatred of the United States , and of people who are not Muslim .\nNeedless to say , when a genuflecting Anderson Cooper ( CNN again ! ) offered Trump a chance to at least say he was only referring to those who believed in a \u201c radical \u201d interpretation of Islam \u2014 which is still problematic for someone who wants to be president , but whatever \u2014 the Donald declined . \u201c It \u2019 s very hard to separate \u201d radicals from the nearly 1.6 billion others , he answered .\nAnyway , that was the topic on Thursday night . But when CNN tossed another softball in Trump \u2019 s direction and gave him another chance to walk it back ( are we going to ask him every single day now ? ) , Trump didn \u2019 t just reject the offer . He went from arguing that it was difficult to tell the difference between a violent jihadist and an 8-year-old child to arguing that \u201c a lot of them \u201d are full of \u201c tremendous hatred \u201d :\nI will tell you there 's something going on that maybe you do n't know about , maybe a lot of other people do n't know about , but there 's tremendous hatred \u2026 And I will stick with exactly what I said to Anderson Cooper . I like to solve problems . We have a serious , serious problem of hate \u2026 We have large portions of a group of people \u2014 Islam \u2014 large portions want to use very , very harsh means .\nIn response , Little Marco offered a tepid critique , saying that Trump didn \u2019 t get that \u201c presidents ca n't just say anything they want. \u201d Rubio added that he wasn \u2019 t \u201c interested in being politically correct , \u201d but that there were pragmatic reasons not to dehumanize 1.6 billion people . That \u2019 s better , I guess ; but as the Intercept \u2019 s Murtaza Hussain tweeted :\nWhy was this the most important moment of the debate ? Because this wasn \u2019 t just about Trump , though he certainly was the driver . It was about the entire Republican Party , and about the millions of Americans who continue to support it . All over the country \u2014 and all over the world \u2014 people are watching . There are millions of people whose perception of the United States is not set in stone just yet .\nAnd this is the country we show them . I can \u2019 t blame them if they choose to turn away .",
