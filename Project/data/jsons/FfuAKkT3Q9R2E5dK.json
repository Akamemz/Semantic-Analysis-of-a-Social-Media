''\nBut he did not go as far as he had on the campaign trail in 2008 .

When asked Friday if the president would take steps to curb gun violence in the form of gun safety laws after the Aurora shootings , White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said , `` The president believes that we need to take common-sense measures that protect Second Amendment rights of Americans , while ensuring that those who should not have guns under existing law do not get them . ''\n`` There has been progress in that regard in terms of improving the volume of quality of information in background check , but I have nothing new , '' Carney added .\nIn July 2011 , Carney said the president directed Attorney General Eric Holder and state leaders to identify measures that would improve safety and protect Second Amendment rights .\n`` We expect to have some more specific announcements in the near future , '' Carney said . But no announcements have been issued .\nGun rights continue to divide Americans . A Pew survey released in April showed 49 % of Americans found it more important to protect the rights of Americans to own guns , while 45 % said it was more important to control gun ownership . The figures shifted when broken down by party ideology , race and sex . Twenty-seven percent of Democrats said it is more important to protect gun rights , while 72 % of Republicans said the same . Sixty percent of men found it more important to protect gun rights and 39 % of women found it more important to protect the rights of Americans to own guns .\nDivides also exist among campaign contributions , according to filings with the Federal Elections Commission , which show an influx of cash disproportionately geared toward Republican candidates .\nIn the 2012 cycle , presumptive Republican presidential Mitt Romney has received $ 126,440 from gun rights groups , compared to Obama 's $ 2,300 . That trend is consistent with the 2008 cycle , when Sen. John McCain collected $ 483,711 in such contributions and Obama received $ 25,987 .",
