''\nKavanaugh was sworn in as a justice Saturday evening in Washington after an extraordinarily fraught nomination that sparked angry protests , nail-biting votes and a national reckoning about sexual assault allegations and who should be believed . Kavanaugh staunchly denied the allegations , but nearly all Senate Democrats voted against his confirmation .\nThe final vote took place Saturday afternoon as the president was flying to Kansas aboard Air Force One , and he invited traveling reporters to his private office to watch the climactic roll call , which was interrupted several times by protesters in the Senate galleries before Capitol Police removed them .\nWhen it was official , Trump delivered a double thumbs-up from his desk . Several aides applauded .\n`` Very , very good , '' Trump said . `` Very happy about it . Great decision . I very much appreciate those 50 great votes and I think he 's going to go down as a totally brilliant Supreme Court Justice for many years . ''\nTrump , throughout the day , insisted Kavanagh would not be tainted by the sexual assault allegations from Christine Blasey Ford and others that nearly tanked his nomination . Trump said he was `` 100 percent '' certain Kavanaugh was innocent .\n`` I have no doubt , '' Trump said , telling reporters that he had chosen Kavanaugh , in part , because `` there 's nobody with a squeaky-clean past like Brett Kavanaugh . '' He said the FBI had done seven background investigations and argued that , had there been an issue , it would have surfaced sooner .\n`` If there was even a scintilla of something wrong \u2014 he was a very big judge for many years on what they call the second highest court \u2014 that would have come out loud and clear , '' he said .\nThroughout the day , Trump also kept his focus on the opposition , saying Kavanaugh had withstood a `` horrible , horrible attack '' that `` nobody should have to go through . ''\nHe continued lashing out at Democrats when he rallied supporters in Topeka , telling them `` radical Democrats '' have become `` an angry , left-wing mob '' and `` too dangerous and too extreme to govern . '' He urged Kansas voters to send Republicans to Congress .\n`` You do n't hand matches to an arsonist and you do n't give power to an angry left-wing mob . And that 's what they 've become , '' he said .\nKavanaugh 's nomination sparked protest across the Capitol , which continued Saturday .

''\nAsked by reporters aboard Air Force One what message he had for women across the country who feel the nomination sends a message that their allegations of sexual assault are n't believed , Trump disagreed with the premise , saying women `` were outraged at what happened to Brett Kavanaugh '' and `` were in many ways stronger than the men in his favor . ''\n`` We have a lot of women that are extremely happy \u2014 a tremendous number \u2014 because they 're thinking of their sons , they 're thinking of their husbands and their brothers and their uncles and others and women are , I think , extremely happy , '' he added .\nTrump has repeatedly sided with men accused of sexual misconduct and has warned of the dangers false accusations pose to men \u2014 even though research has shown false accusations to be extremely rare .\nPointing to television footage of protesters outside the Capitol , he said their numbers paled in comparison to the thousands of supporters awaiting him in Kansas .\n`` The crowd in front of the U.S. Supreme Court is tiny , looks like about 200 people ( & most are onlookers ) - that would n't even fill the first couple of rows of our Kansas Rally , or any of our Rallies for that matter !
