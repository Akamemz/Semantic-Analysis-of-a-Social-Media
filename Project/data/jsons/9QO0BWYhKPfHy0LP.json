    "content": "The U.S. intelligence community and the Pentagon have quietly agreed on the outlines of an offensive cyberattack that the United States would unleash if Russia electronically interferes with the 2018 midterm election on Nov. 6 , according to current and former senior U.S. officials who are familiar with the plan .\nIn preparation for its potential use , U.S. military hackers have been given the go-ahead to gain access to Russian cybersystems that they feel is needed to let the plan unfold quickly , the officials said .\nThe effort constitutes one of the first major cyberbattle plans organized under a new government policy enabling potential offensive operations to proceed more quickly once the parameters have been worked out in advance and agreed among key agencies .\nWhile U.S. national-security officials have so far reported only intermittent efforts by Russian sources to compromise political organizations and campaigns , they have been worried\u2014in the aftermath of Russia \u2019 s digital contact with U.S. election systems in 2016\u2014that Moscow might unleash more aggressive interference in the hours before voting begins , while the polls are open , or when the votes are being tabulated .\nThe existence of such a plan means that America is more fully integrating offensive cyberattacks into its overall military planning systems , a move likely to make cybercombat more likely and eventually more commonplace , sometimes without first gaining specific presidential approval . Cyberattacks are now on a more obvious path , in short , to becoming a regular currency of warfare .\nThe plan for retaliation against Russia is one of the first to be organized since President Donald Trump signed an executive order in August that simplifies and shortens the review for such operations . It has the effect\u2014according to those familiar with the process\u2014of giving the Pentagon additional prerogatives to prepare for strikes . It also preemptively addresses traditional intelligence community concerns that cyberattacks will compromise ongoing or future intelligence-gathering by exposing U.S. data collection operations .\nThe officials declined to provide details about what the United States will do in response to Russian interference in the election . But administration officials have made clear that the trigger for a broader response would have to be something more than \u201c malign influence ... trying to sway peoples \u2019 opinion or the way people might vote , \u201d as a senior administration official put it on a call with reporters on Oct. 31 organized by the White House . \u201c This is something that has happened since the dawn of the republic . \u201d\nSocial-media influence operations , widely used by Russia in 2016 and again over the past two years , were the focus of an indictment by the Justice Department of Russian national Elena Alekseevna Khusyaynova unveiled Oct. 19 , in which she was charged with conspiring with others against the United States .\nThe senior official clarified that it would be direct interference\u2014efforts to tamper with voting registration and recording votes\u2014that would bring \u201c swift and severe action. \u201d The reason , the official said , is \u201c that fundamentally wrecks the natural process that we have established in this country. \u201d That official didn \u2019 t describe what the U.S. action would be .\nIn 2016 Russian hackers tried to break into the election systems of at least 21 states , although some were not notified by Washington until September 2017 . In at least one state , Illinois , Russian hackers managed to gain access to voter registration data , although state officials said that none of the information was altered . Several other state systems were rumored to have been breached , although none have publicly confirmed it .\nOfficials say the new Trump cyberoperations order , National Security Presidential Memorandum 13 ( NSPM 13 ) , is designed to allow Defense Secretary James Mattis and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats to approve retaliatory strikes without the approval of others in the government , and in certain cases without White House approval .\nIt replaces an Obama-era executive order that required more extensive review before cyberweapons could be used offensively , called Presidential Policy Directive 20 ( PPD 20 ) . That order was classified but became public when former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked it in 2013 , as part of a broader effort by him to expose the scale of American cyberspying .\nOne of the key , unpublicized consequences of the new directive is that military planners can prepare for cyberstrikes\u2014as called for in interagency agreements in advance\u2014by gaining access to the computer systems of potential targets well before any order has been given to attack , or even before a foreign attack has occurred , the officials said . That access is meant to pave the way for deploying malware\u2014packages of compromising computer instructions\u2014swiftly inside foreign networks and servers , when a decision is made to proceed .\n\u201c The trigger for retaliation would have to be something more than \u2018 trying to sway peoples \u2019 opinion or the way people might vote. \u2019 It 's direct interference\u2014efforts to tamper with voting registration and recording votes\u2014that would bring \u2018 swift and severe action . \u2019 \u201d\nAccording to the officials \u2019 accounts , military planners in the past were sometimes held back by the intelligence community from hacking into foreign networks for fear of compromising access that spies considered useful for collecting information , particularly when it was uncertain whether any offensive operation would eventually be approved . With only a small number of skilled military hackers available , they were also hesitant to invest time in gaining access to systems not explicitly part of an approved strike .\nObama \u2019 s order allowed for emergency defensive actions by the heads of U.S. agencies , but required a much more protracted process for the premeditated deployment of cyberweapons . Major attacks had to be directly approved by the president , while other smaller operations required the signoff of three committees including a policy coordination committee , the National Security Council \u2019 s Deputies Committee and the Principals Committee , which military officials complained included agencies without a direct connection to the issues associated with cyberattacks .\n\u201c The Department of Defense ( DoD ) would get frustrated when Transportation , or another agency , would weigh in on things they wanted to do , \u201d a former national security official who worked for both Democratic and Republican presidents said . \u201c If DoD wanted to have access and be ready , they were hamstrung . \u201d\nOne of the U.S. officials used an analogy to describe the new approach : Spy agencies , the official said , sometimes try to place an agent in a service position at a facility run by an adversary . That agent \u2019 s assignment would be to learn access codes , map the facility and conduct wide surveillance of its operations , copy sets of keys , and perhaps unlock doors . That information and access would allow the intelligence agency , in theory , to sneak a bomb into the facility when it wants to .\nThis is what the military is now authorized to do after an interagency agreement has been reached that a particular major threat exists that might warrant a swift and effective cyberresponse , the officials said . It essentially is meant to ensure that U.S. cyberwarriors can quickly drop off weapons when needed . \u201c You don \u2019 t need to pre-position something if you have the right access , \u201d said one of the officials .\nWhile some officials and cyberexperts have said that certain offensive cyberoperations risk violating international law , because of the possibility they might cause collateral damage and harm civilians outside target networks , government lawyers have approved the new approach after deciding that letting the military hack into a foreign system is not an act of war , so long as a cyberweapon hasn \u2019 t yet been emplaced and the specific system being targeted isn \u2019 t actually destroyed .\nWhile declining to discuss specifics about the new directive or any potential cyberoperations , Grant Schneider , a senior director for cybersecurity at the National Security Council , said in an interview after an appearance at a public event that advance military planning would help speed up cyber-responses . \u201c It allows for agencies to start making plans sooner , start identifying potential targets sooner , and start being able to have impacts sooner , \u201d he said .\nNSPM 13 , which remains classified , was the backbone of Trump \u2019 s new National Cyber Strategy , a mostly unclassified public document which was released in September .\nThat strategy was rolled out with descriptions from National Security Adviser John Bolton of a more aggressive use of cyberweapons , consistent with his general foreign-policy stance since taking the job in April . At that time officials declined to provide any specifics on how the new policy would make cyber-response faster , or cut down on red tape , but claimed it would do both .\nDuring a press conference on September 20 to roll out the new cyberstrategy , Bolton said that \u201c for any nation that \u2019 s taking cyberactivity against the United States , they should expect , and this is part of creating structures of deterrence , so that it 's publicly known as well , we will respond offensively as well as defensively. \u201d During a speech on Oct. 31 , he said the United States was \u201c right now undertaking offensive cyberoperations \u201d to safeguard the election , without detailing what those are .\nAccording to sources , the new executive order , NSPM 13 , is designed around the idea of pre-approved Concepts of Operation\u2014one of the first of which is the plan to act against Russia if key red lines are crossed . The concepts set the types of targets and the boundaries for types of action through coordination between agencies .\nIt doesn \u2019 t require a full meeting of Cabinet officials and can exclude some of the decision makers who were part of the PPD 20 process . Most of the coordination will take place between the Office of the Director of National Intelligence , the Pentagon , and the Department of Homeland Security , according to sources .\n\u201c The concept is that you would approve a category of activities against a defined adversary , that would be pre-approved by the appropriate people , within some left-and-right bounds , \u201d one of the officials said . Once a concept is approved , an agency can scout a target and gain access , and sometimes might go ahead and take action with limited notice to other coordinating agencies .\nWhile several Obama-era officials said that the new approach sounded like a step in the right direction , others cautioned that a procedure providing earlier approval with fewer consulting officials could mean that larger concerns about an offensive cyberoperation won \u2019 t be heard .\n\u201c We \u2019 re in a really deep deterrence hole to Russia right now .
