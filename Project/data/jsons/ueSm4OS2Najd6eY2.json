    "content": "He asked the Supreme Court to acknowledge his First Amendment rights , and it did\nAn average guy , provoked enough , can accomplish things that are above average .\nMark Janus is such a guy . Provoked by what he believed was a bald violation of his First Amendment rights , he took action to see them protected . And he prevailed . Big time , as an average guy might say .\nHis name , italicized , will live on now in legal textbooks and amicus curiae footnotes , will be cited at length in law-school seminars and oral arguments , will be uttered with contempt in union headquarters , with respect in conservative gatherings . And it will be classified under \u201c landmark. \u201d Maybe even give birth to a phrase , \u201c Janus rights . \u201d\nLast June , in Mark Janus v. American Federation of State , County , and Municipal Employees , Council 31 , commonly known as Janus v. AFSCME , the United States Supreme Court ruled 5\u20134 that public-sector unions may not automatically enroll workers as members and collect fees from them . Janus was a loss for labor . A big loss . And it was a major \u2014 even surprising , and far-reaching \u2014 victory for conservatives and First Amendment champions .\nMark Janus describes himself as \u201c just an average guy , a middle-class person who goes to work every day. \u201d And work is where this saga of jurisprudence , of constitutional rights , of modern-day politics and union power , all begins . A lifelong resident of Springfield , Ill. , Janus , a down-to-earth civic-minded citizen ( he is an Eagle Scout ) , graduated in 1975 from Illinois College , a business-administration major whose career path meandered . He worked for his dad \u2019 s beauty-supply company and then at the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs , where his duties centered on economic-development small-business loans .\nJanus soon returned to the private sector , as an accountant for a printing company and then in his own spiral-binding business , which he eventually sold . Then followed an encore as a government employee .\nAnd it was there , working as a child-support specialist for the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services , that the worm turned . Central to all that happened in this saga is this fact : Employee Janus was not a member of the office \u2019 s overseeing union , Local 2600 of AFSCME .\nSo Janus was surprised \u201c when I got my first paycheck , \u201d he tells \u2588\u2588\u2588 . It was unlike his first job with Illinois \u2014 \u201c This time I saw a deduction for union dues. \u201d It happened automatically . \u201c During the normal intake process when I started working , no one in HR said anything about unions , about having to pay fees or dues . And I never joined the union. \u201d He inquired of his colleagues : What gives ? \u201c I was told \u2018 Everyone had to pay in some manner \u2019 and \u2018 It \u2019 s just mandatory. \u2019 At the time I thought \u2014 that \u2019 s just the way it is . I have no choice . \u201d\nThe absence of choice was the rule . The reason : In its Abood v. Detroit Board of Education decision ( 1977 ) , the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that teachers who objected to being forced by state law to pay fees to a union that engaged in political activities they opposed nonetheless had an obligation to pay , and as a condition of employment .\nThe Court \u2019 s decision affirmed the situation in which Mark Janus found himself years later : In many non-right-to-work states , a public-sector union may operate on behalf of all employees , whether union members or not , and , if it does , nonmembers pay \u201c agency fees \u201d through paycheck deductions . All that cash is then used to bankroll the union \u2019 s activities related to , as the Court wrote in Abood , \u201c collective bargaining , contract administration , and grievance adjustment purposes . \u201d\nBut : What about the free-speech complaints of the Abood plaintiffs ? Through the agency fees , their money was underwriting advocacy for politics they disdained . The Court , ruling that there was a legitimate First Amendment point here , enacted what it thought was a reasonable compromise , stating that the Constitution relieved the plaintiffs from being assessed that slice of \u201c charges , dues , or assessments \u201d related to a union \u2019 s political activities .\nAs compromises go , Abood \u2019 s was destined for failure : Unstated , and never emerging over the decades , was any formula for truly quantifying the percentage of a union \u2019 s political activity and then reimbursing nonmembers for it . There were also unanswered , sticky questions . Who does the slicing ? What size should the slice be ? Who says what is or isn \u2019 t political activity ? Abood offered no workable way to untangle the rat \u2019 s nest of money , union activities , and free speech .\nMark Janus was 24 years old when Abood was decided . More than 30 years after the decision was handed down , the way to offset compulsory union fees to account for objectionable political speech remained unsettled . Now in his second Illinois-government job , Janus found every pay period repeating an injustice : \u201c As time went on , I saw more and more of this money going to AFSCME . For all intents and purposes , it was a political organization. \u201d Janus could not shake his irritation as he connected the dots of complicity between his union-collected fees , the state political power structure , and the fiscal straits of Illinois .\nNot this one . Says Janus , who had no partisan affiliation , \u201c I didn \u2019 t see my union working totally for the good of Illinois government . For years it supported candidates who put Illinois into its current budget and pension crisis . Government unions have pushed for government spending that made the state \u2019 s fiscal situation worse . How is that good for the people of the state ? Or , for that matter , for my fellow union members who face the threat of layoffs or their pension funds someday running dry ? \u201d\nUnless he opted for unemployment , Janus was essentially a co-conspirator through his paycheck , dunned every month . \u201c I felt I was totally powerless and in a way violated . Here was all this money coming out of my check month after month , and the union was not paying any attention to my beliefs . \u201d\nNor was the union providing information : \u201c I did talk to my union steward about this but always received such a nebulous response. \u201d Janus said he pressed to learn how the union was spending the fees and dues : \u201c There was no real breakdown . I asked around , \u2018 Where is this all going ? \u2019 And the answer was \u2018 Well , we really can \u2019 t tell you. \u2019 There was a total lack of transparency . \u201d\nHis mounting frustration , though , wasn \u2019 t centered on a pilfered paycheck . It focused on his First Amendment rights . \u201c Our Bill of Rights is crystal clear on the topic , \u201d he wrote in an op-ed for the Springfield State Journal-Register in September 2017 . \u201c The First Amendment guarantees freedom of speech and freedom of association . I should not be forced into association with a union that claims to represent my interests when it really doesn \u2019 t . \u201d\nThe average guy had had enough . In 2015 , Janus got in touch with the Illinois-based Liberty Justice Center , a respected public-interest litigation group that fights for free speech and other rights . He had decided to seek legal redress through the courts . \u201c I found out about the people at Liberty Justice Center . I learned about how they had fought for this cause . So we started a dialogue , and over the process we determined that we would file a case , that we would sue AFSCME . \u201d\nSo would the state \u2019 s new Republican governor . Bruce Rauner , who won election in 2014 in part by campaigning against union excesses , issued an executive order to halt the collection of \u201c agency fees \u201d from non\u2013union members and then filed a federal lawsuit against AFSCME and other unions to have the Illinois law mandating \u201c fair share contract provisions \u201d tossed out for violating First Amendment rights . This was precisely Janus \u2019 s beef . Rauner \u2019 s suit was an ideal vehicle for him .\nTogether with two other state employees , Marie Quigley and Brian Trygg , Janus joined as a plaintiff to Rauner \u2019 s suit . A federal judge then ruled that the governor lacked standing , leaving the trio , which became an uno when Quigley opted out and Trygg was deemed to have a conflict .\nWithin months , Janus was the sole plaintiff in what had turned into a major federal case , albeit one with welcome competition in that category . In July 2015 , the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case of Rebecca Friedrichs , an elementary-school teacher who sued the California Teachers Association on similar grounds . A victory in Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association would likely satisfy Janus \u2019 s objectives . Oral argument was heard in January 2016 . Conservatives got hopeful . Unions got scared .\nAnd then Justice Antonin Scalia died . So too did the Friedrichs suit , when a divided court , in a 4\u20134 tie , put an end to the teacher \u2019 s campaign .\nThat made Janus the leading federal case to redress the violation of government workers \u2019 First Amendment rights . Would the Supreme Court hear it ? In late 2017 , cert was granted , and the next February the Court held oral argument . With Justice Neil Gorsuch having replaced Scalia , hopes reemerged that the Court might overturn not only the state statute but also the unworkable Abood precedent . That was precisely the request made by Janus \u2019 s counsel , led by William Messenger of the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation , when the Court agreed to hear the case in late 2017 :\nAbood is offensive to the First Amendment . It permits the government to compel employees to subsidize an advocacy group \u2019 s political activity : namely , speaking to the government to influence governmental policies . . . . Abood is inconsistent with this Court \u2019 s precedents that subject instances of compelled speech and association to heightened constitutional scrutiny ; Abood \u2019 s framework is unworkable and does not protect employee rights ; and no reliance interests justify retaining Abood . The Court should abandon Abood and instead follow its precedents that subject compelled speech and association to heightened First Amendment scrutiny .\nThat , and more , happened : The Alito-written Janus ruling the Court issued on June 27 , 2018 , was broader and deeper than many had anticipated .\nVincent Vernuccio , a senior fellow at Mackinac Center for Public Policy and a labor-policy expert , describes Janus as \u201c a tremendous victory \u201d and says that \u201c the size of the victory was a big surprise to most followers of the Court. \u201d Because of the Friedrichs vote in 2016 , they felt reasonably sure that in Janus \u201c the Court was going to uphold the First Amendment rights of public employees. \u201d However , \u201c Alito went further and said that all public employees must opt in to their union \u201d if they want to belong to it , rather than being automatically enrolled and allowed to opt out .\nThis \u201c affirmative consent \u201d requirement \u201c breaks new ground , \u201d Vernuccio says . It \u2019 s unambiguous . Now a government employee must , essentially , tell an employer , \u201c Yes , I want to pay dues or agency fees \u201d before funds can be deducted from his pay . The days of automatic withholding ended along with Abood . The unions \u2019 reliable money spigot was reliable no longer . The Janus decision could impoverish unions if \u201c affirmative consent \u201d in practice severely reduces the revenue they collect from dues . The political consequences are immense .\nUnions are fighting the efforts by conservative groups to inform government employees \u2014 both union members and nonmembers \u2014 of their new Janus rights . Indeed , AFSCME and other government-employee unions , including the powerful Service Employees International Union ( SEIU ) , were reacting even before Janus was handed down . For unions , the Friedrichs decision had been at best a temporary win : Donald Trump \u2019 s election , and Gorsuch \u2019 s nomination and confirmation , meant that a defeat of some kind , and likely sooner rather than later , was in the offing .\nIn Connecticut , where government unions are considered the most powerful special interest , the Yankee Institute for Public Policy is directly informing workers of their Janus rights . \u201c We genuinely believe in workers \u2019 rights \u2014 each individual worker should have the right to choose the arrangement that suits him or her best , \u201d says Yankee president Carol Platt Liebau . \u201c If it means being part of a government union , fine . But if the government unions aren \u2019 t serving their members well \u2014 and many are not \u2014 those workers should be aware of their rights . They should know that they don \u2019 t have to hand over a significant portion of their paychecks to an organization that may not be looking out for them and [ in which ] , in most cases , they didn \u2019 t have any voice in choosing their representative . \u201d\nThe pushback \u2014 in the offices of government workers and in the statehouse \u2014 has been fierce . Despite the Janus ruling , AFSCME Council 4 is denying government employees in Connecticut their opt-out , never mind seeking their affirmative consent . Among the unions \u2019 denial tactics are setting limited windows during which opt-outs can be requested .\nAnd then there is intimidation . \u201c Employees have shared stories with us that illustrate why they are hesitant to ask their HR , payroll department , or union representative about their Janus rights , \u201d Liebau adds . \u201c After these employees raised a question or asked to resign from their union , they found themselves singled out on proclamations posted to bulletin boards in their workplace . Often union reps share the names of workers who have left the union . \u201d\nElsewhere , there is evidence \u2014 numerical , not anecdotal \u2014 that conservative efforts to inform workers are having an impact .\nFreedom Foundation , with offices in Washington State , California , and Oregon , has quarterbacked campaigns to apprise workers of their Janus rights . In February , Oregon officials reported that SEIU-represented employees declined from 21,666 to 16,108 from June through the end of December . Twenty-six percent of Oregon state workers represented by SEIU 503 no longer pay dues . A fluke ? No . The Oregon School Employees Association , representing 22,000 non-teacher school workers , has seen a dramatic 31 percent drop in dues-paying members in the eight months since Janus was decided .\nThe union pushback is determined , widespread , and influential in many state legislatures , where , says Maxford Nelsen , Freedom Foundation \u2019 s director of labor policy , government unions have strong allies . \u201c What we \u2019 re seeing on the West Coast is an effort in state legislatures to shield unions from the effects of Janus and the loss of membership . It \u2019 s really being taken to extremes . For example , there is legislation introduced in Oregon that would require direct taxpayer funding of unions . That shows the lengths and depths to which legislatures will go to prop up this special interest . \u201d\nNelsen has been focused on a Washington State bill that would maximize union-dues collection and shield unions from liabilities , including criminal , in their attempts to counter Janus . \u201c This bill would protect labor unions , making them completely exempt from liability related to union-dues collections . If this bill became law , unions could use any methods , even illegal , to collect dues and fees , but employees would be prevented from seeking redress before court or state agencies . A union or its representative could break state law \u2014 someone could engage in , say , a criminal act of forgery of an employee opt-in form . \u201d\nAFSCME has particular contempt for Freedom Foundation . In a nuance-free video , Don \u2019 t Fall for the Freedom Foundation \u2019 s Lies , AFSCME president Lee Saunders charges that \u201c a whole network of shadowy groups funded by CEOs and billionaires is trying to scam us . . . . Don \u2019 t be fooled : The Freedom Foundation doesn \u2019 t fight for our freedom ; it stands for the freedom of corporations to rig the economy in their own favor. \u201d He gives AFSCME members their orders : \u201c If they contact you , report it at once . . . . If you get one of their emails , delete it . If they call you , hang up . If they come to your door , slam it in their faces . \u201d\nAnother AFSCME bogeyman is State Policy Network , the collective of right-of-center state think tanks dedicated to personal freedom . Even before the Court ruled , AFSCME launched a campaign to deride SPN \u2019 s efforts to promote Janus through the legal system . On its website , AFSCME described SPN as purveying \u201c misinformation to workers \u201d and pushing its \u201c agenda through the courts . The latest example of that agenda is the Janus case. \u201d The \u201c billionaires and corporate CEOs \u201d behind Janus \u201c have been trying to smash \u201d the freedom of workers \u201c to join together in strong unions and build strength through numbers . \u201d\nSo it goes . And so it will continue to go . \u201c Janus , as significant and as important as it was , \u201d says Nelsen , is just a first step . \u201c If the only thing that ever happens on this front is the Janus decision , then there won \u2019 t be much change. \u201d He predicts years of court and legislative actions to defend workers \u2019 First Amendment rights . \u201c We need to make sure that the principles acknowledged in the ruling are enacted . There \u2019 s a lot of follow-up work to do . \u201d\nAs for the man whose name will live on in italics , Mark Janus , union members at his former job threw a party when he left . They didn \u2019 t invite him . Working now for Liberty Justice Center , Janus plans to be in on the follow-up , no matter the lumps . He \u2019 s taken plenty and expects plenty more : \u201c There are a lot of people on the other side , on social media , looking at me like a pariah . Like I am backed by Big Money and Dark Money people . \u201d\n\u201c Initially I was na\u00efve about the reaction , \u201d he admits . \u201c But now , I am meeting union people who come up to me and who are telling me their stories , stories that are totally unbelievable about how they are treated . How their unions totally ignore them and are not responsive. \u201d ( And he will receive the Whittaker Chambers Award for political courage at the 2019 \u2588\u2588\u2588 Institute Ideas Summit in Washington , D.C . )\nWhich inspires him to carry on . \u201c The bottom-line goal here is to free government workers from being forced to financially support government unions . . . . This case has not been about ending collective bargaining , or ending unions or the rights of unions . It \u2019 s been about giving workers a choice . \u201d\nIf only the union had given this average guy that in the first place .\nThis article appears as \u201c The Freedom of the Average Guy \u201d in the March 25 , 2019 , print edition of \u2588\u2588\u2588 .",

Provoked by what he believed was a bald violation of his First Amendment rights, he took action to see them protected. And he prevailed. Big time, as an average guy might say.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHis name, italicized, will live on now in legal textbooks and amicus curiae footnotes, will be cited at length in law-school seminars and oral arguments, will be uttered with contempt in union headquarters, with respect in conservative gatherings. And it will be classified under \u201clandmark.\u201d Maybe even give birth to a phrase, \u201cJanus rights.\u201d\n\nLast June, in Mark Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, Council 31, commonly known as Janus v. AFSCME, the United States Supreme Court ruled 5\u20134 that public-sector unions may not automatically enroll workers as members and collect fees from them. Janus was a loss for labor. A big loss. And it was a major \u2014 even surprising, and far-reaching \u2014 victory for conservatives and First Amendment champions.\n\nMark Janus describes himself as \u201cjust an average guy, a middle-class person who goes to work every day.\u201d And work is where this saga of jurisprudence, of constitutional rights, of modern-day politics and union power, all begins. A lifelong resident of Springfield, Ill., Janus, a down-to-earth civic-minded citizen (he is an Eagle Scout), graduated in 1975 from Illinois College, a business-administration major whose career path meandered. He worked for his dad\u2019s beauty-supply company and then at the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs, where his duties centered on economic-development small-business loans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanus soon returned to the private sector, as an accountant for a printing company and then in his own spiral-binding business, which he eventually sold.

Central to all that happened in this saga is this fact: Employee Janus was not a member of the office\u2019s overseeing union, Local 2600 of AFSCME.\n\nSo Janus was surprised \u201cwhen I got my first paycheck,\u201d he tells National Review. It was unlike his first job with Illinois \u2014 \u201cThis time I saw a deduction for union dues.\u201d It happened automatically. \u201cDuring the normal intake process when I started working, no one in HR said anything about unions, about having to pay fees or dues.

All that cash is then used to bankroll the union\u2019s activities related to, as the Court wrote in Abood, \u201ccollective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment purposes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut: What about the free-speech complaints of the Abood plaintiffs? Through the agency fees, their money was underwriting advocacy for politics they disdained. The Court, ruling that there was a legitimate First Amendment point here, enacted what it thought was a reasonable compromise, stating that the Constitution relieved the plaintiffs from being assessed that slice of \u201ccharges, dues, or assessments\u201d related to a union\u2019s political activities.\n\nAs compromises go, Abood\u2019s was destined for failure: Unstated, and never emerging over the decades, was any formula for truly quantifying the percentage of a union\u2019s political activity and then reimbursing nonmembers for it. There were also unanswered, sticky questions. Who does the slicing? What size should the slice be? Who says what is or isn\u2019t political activity? Abood offered no workable way to untangle the rat\u2019s nest of money, union activities, and free speech.\n\nMark Janus was 24 years old when Abood was decided. More than 30 years after the decision was handed down, the way to offset compulsory union fees to account for objectionable political speech remained unsettled. Now in his second Illinois-government job, Janus found every pay period repeating an injustice: \u201cAs time went on, I saw more and more of this money going to AFSCME.

Simply stew?\n\nNot this one. Says Janus, who had no partisan affiliation, \u201cI didn\u2019t see my union working totally for the good of Illinois government. For years it supported candidates who put Illinois into its current budget and pension crisis. Government unions have pushed for government spending that made the state\u2019s fiscal situation worse. How is that good for the people of the state?

It focused on his First Amendment rights. \u201cOur Bill of Rights is crystal clear on the topic,\u201d he wrote in an op-ed for the Springfield State Journal-Register in September 2017. \u201cThe First Amendment guarantees freedom of speech and freedom of association. I should not be forced into association with a union that claims to represent my interests when it really doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe average guy had had enough. In 2015, Janus got in touch with the Illinois-based Liberty Justice Center, a respected public-interest litigation group that fights for free speech and other rights. He had decided to seek legal redress through the courts. \u201cI found out about the people at Liberty Justice Center. I learned about how they had fought for this cause. So we started a dialogue, and over the process we determined that we would file a case, that we would sue AFSCME.\u201d\n\nSo would the state\u2019s new Republican governor. Bruce Rauner, who won election in 2014 in part by campaigning against union excesses, issued an executive order to halt the collection of \u201cagency fees\u201d from non\u2013union members and then filed a federal lawsuit against AFSCME and other unions to have the Illinois law mandating \u201cfair share contract provisions\u201d tossed out for violating First Amendment rights. This was precisely Janus\u2019s beef. Rauner\u2019s suit was an ideal vehicle for him.\n\nTogether with two other state employees, Marie Quigley and Brian Trygg, Janus joined as a plaintiff to Rauner\u2019s suit. A federal judge then ruled that the governor lacked standing, leaving the trio, which became an uno when Quigley opted out and Trygg was deemed to have a conflict.\n\nWithin months, Janus was the sole plaintiff in what had turned into a major federal case, albeit one with welcome competition in that category. In July 2015, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case of Rebecca Friedrichs, an elementary-school teacher who sued the California Teachers Association on similar grounds. A victory in Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association would likely satisfy Janus\u2019s objectives. Oral argument was heard in January 2016. Conservatives got hopeful. Unions got scared.\n\nAnd then Justice Antonin Scalia died. So too did the Friedrichs suit, when a divided court, in a 4\u20134 tie, put an end to the teacher\u2019s campaign.\n\nThat made Janus the leading federal case to redress the violation of government workers\u2019 First Amendment rights. Would the Supreme Court hear it? In late 2017, cert was granted, and the next February the Court held oral argument. With Justice Neil Gorsuch having replaced Scalia, hopes reemerged that the Court might overturn not only the state statute but also the unworkable Abood precedent. That was precisely the request made by Janus\u2019s counsel, led by William Messenger of the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, when the Court agreed to hear the case in late 2017:\n\nAbood is offensive to the First Amendment. It permits the government to compel employees to subsidize an advocacy group\u2019s political activity: namely, speaking to the government to influence governmental policies. . . . Abood is inconsistent with this Court\u2019s precedents that subject instances of compelled speech and association to heightened constitutional scrutiny; Abood\u2019s framework is unworkable and does not protect employee rights; and no reliance interests justify retaining Abood. The Court should abandon Abood and instead follow its precedents that subject compelled speech and association to heightened First Amendment scrutiny.\n\nThat, and more, happened: The Alito-written Janus ruling the Court issued on June 27, 2018, was broader and deeper than many had anticipated.\n\nVincent Vernuccio, a senior fellow at Mackinac Center for Public Policy and a labor-policy expert, describes Janus as \u201ca tremendous victory\u201d and says that \u201cthe size of the victory was a big surprise to most followers of the Court.\u201d Because of the Friedrichs vote in 2016, they felt reasonably sure that in Janus \u201cthe Court was going to uphold the First Amendment rights of public employees.\u201d However, \u201cAlito went further and said that all public employees must opt in to their union\u201d if they want to belong to it, rather than being automatically enrolled and allowed to opt out.\n\nThis \u201caffirmative consent\u201d requirement \u201cbreaks new ground,\u201d Vernuccio says. It\u2019s unambiguous. Now a government employee must, essentially, tell an employer, \u201cYes, I want to pay dues or agency fees\u201d before funds can be deducted from his pay. The days of automatic withholding ended along with Abood. The unions\u2019 reliable money spigot was reliable no longer. The Janus decision could impoverish unions if \u201caffirmative consent\u201d in practice severely reduces the revenue they collect from dues. The political consequences are immense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnions are fighting the efforts by conservative groups to inform government employees \u2014 both union members and nonmembers \u2014 of their new Janus rights. Indeed, AFSCME and other government-employee unions, including the powerful Service Employees International Union (SEIU), were reacting even before Janus was handed down. For unions, the Friedrichs decision had been at best a temporary win: Donald Trump\u2019s election, and Gorsuch\u2019s nomination and confirmation, meant that a defeat of some kind, and likely sooner rather than later, was in the offing.\n\nIn Connecticut, where government unions are considered the most powerful special interest, the Yankee Institute for Public Policy is directly informing workers of their Janus rights. \u201cWe genuinely believe in workers\u2019 rights \u2014 each individual worker should have the right to choose the arrangement that suits him or her best,\u201d says Yankee president Carol Platt Liebau. \u201cIf it means being part of a government union, fine. But if the government unions aren\u2019t serving their members well \u2014 and many are not \u2014 those workers should be aware of their rights. They should know that they don\u2019t have to hand over a significant portion of their paychecks to an organization that may not be looking out for them and [in which], in most cases, they didn\u2019t have any voice in choosing their representative.\u201d\n\nThe pushback \u2014 in the offices of government workers and in the statehouse \u2014 has been fierce. Despite the Janus ruling, AFSCME Council 4 is denying government employees in Connecticut their opt-out, never mind seeking their affirmative consent. Among the unions\u2019 denial tactics are setting limited windows during which opt-outs can be requested.\n\nAnd then there is intimidation. \u201cEmployees have shared stories with us that illustrate why they are hesitant to ask their HR, payroll department, or union representative about their Janus rights,\u201d Liebau adds. \u201cAfter these employees raised a question or asked to resign from their union, they found themselves singled out on proclamations posted to bulletin boards in their workplace. Often union reps share the names of workers who have left the union.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, there is evidence \u2014 numerical, not anecdotal \u2014 that conservative efforts to inform workers are having an impact.\n\nFreedom Foundation, with offices in Washington State, California, and Oregon, has quarterbacked campaigns to apprise workers of their Janus rights. In February, Oregon officials reported that SEIU-represented employees declined from 21,666 to 16,108 from June through the end of December. Twenty-six percent of Oregon state workers represented by SEIU 503 no longer pay dues. A fluke? No. The Oregon School Employees Association, representing 22,000 non-teacher school workers, has seen a dramatic 31 percent drop in dues-paying members in the eight months since Janus was decided.\n\nThe union pushback is determined, widespread, and influential in many state legislatures, where, says Maxford Nelsen, Freedom Foundation\u2019s director of labor policy, government unions have strong allies. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing on the West Coast is an effort in state legislatures to shield unions from the effects of Janus and the loss of membership. It\u2019s really being taken to extremes. For example, there is legislation introduced in Oregon that would require direct taxpayer funding of unions. That shows the lengths and depths to which legislatures will go to prop up this special interest.\u201d\n\nNelsen has been focused on a Washington State bill that would maximize union-dues collection and shield unions from liabilities, including criminal, in their attempts to counter Janus. \u201cThis bill would protect labor unions, making them completely exempt from liability related to union-dues collections. If this bill became law, unions could use any methods, even illegal, to collect dues and fees, but employees would be prevented from seeking redress before court or state agencies. A union or its representative could break state law \u2014 someone could engage in, say, a criminal act of forgery of an employee opt-in form.\u201d\n\nAFSCME has particular contempt for Freedom Foundation. In a nuance-free video, Don\u2019t Fall for the Freedom Foundation\u2019s Lies, AFSCME president Lee Saunders charges that \u201ca whole network of shadowy groups funded by CEOs and billionaires is trying to scam us. . . . Don\u2019t be fooled: The Freedom Foundation doesn\u2019t fight for our freedom; it stands for the freedom of corporations to rig the economy in their own favor.\u201d He gives AFSCME members their orders: \u201cIf they contact you, report it at once. . . . If you get one of their emails, delete it. If they call you, hang up. If they come to your door, slam it in their faces.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother AFSCME bogeyman is State Policy Network, the collective of right-of-center state think tanks dedicated to personal freedom. Even before the Court ruled, AFSCME launched a campaign to deride SPN\u2019s efforts to promote Janus through the legal system. On its website, AFSCME described SPN as purveying \u201cmisinformation to workers\u201d and pushing its \u201cagenda through the courts. The latest example of that agenda is the Janus case.\u201d The \u201cbillionaires and corporate CEOs\u201d behind Janus \u201chave been trying to smash\u201d the freedom of workers \u201cto join together in strong unions and build strength through numbers.\u201d\n\nSo it goes. And so it will continue to go. \u201cJanus, as significant and as important as it was,\u201d says Nelsen, is just a first step. \u201cIf the only thing that ever happens on this front is the Janus decision, then there won\u2019t be much change.\u201d He predicts years of court and legislative actions to defend workers\u2019 First Amendment rights. \u201cWe need to make sure that the principles acknowledged in the ruling are enacted. There\u2019s a lot of follow-up work to do.\u201d\n\nAs for the man whose name will live on in italics, Mark Janus, union members at his former job threw a party when he left. They didn\u2019t invite him. Working now for Liberty Justice Center, Janus plans to be in on the follow-up, no matter the lumps. He\u2019s taken plenty and expects plenty more: \u201cThere are a lot of people on the other side, on social media, looking at me like a pariah. Like I am backed by Big Money and Dark Money people.\u201d\n\n\u201cInitially I was na\u00efve about the reaction,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut now, I am meeting union people who come up to me and who are telling me their stories, stories that are totally unbelievable about how they are treated. How their unions totally ignore them and are not responsive.\u201d (And he will receive the Whittaker Chambers Award for political courage at the 2019 National Review Institute Ideas Summit in Washington, D.C.)\n\nWhich inspires him to carry on. \u201cThe bottom-line goal here is to free government workers from being forced to financially support government unions. . . . This case has not been about ending collective bargaining, or ending unions or the rights of unions. It\u2019s been about giving workers a choice.\u201d\n\nIf only the union had given this average guy that in the first place.\n\nThis article appears as \u201cThe Freedom of the Average Guy\u201d in the March 25, 2019, print edition of National Review.",
