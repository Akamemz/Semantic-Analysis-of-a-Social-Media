At around 4:30 am on Saturday , an Iranian drone entered Israeli territory from Syria .

Middle East security experts , like the Royal United Services Institute \u2019 s Shashank Joshi , noted this Israeli aerial attack was quite big compared to previous ones .\nFor comparison , Israel used 8 F16s plus 5 F15s during the attack on Osirak in 1981 . 4 F16s and 4 F15s reportedly used during the strike against Syria 's reactor in 2007. https : //t.co/W9Sh9SYUyi \u2014 Shashank Joshi ( @ shashj ) February 10 , 2018\nSyria didn \u2019 t take kindly to that , however , and it launched anti-aircraft missiles into the sky \u2014 an Israeli official confirmed that the munitions hit one of Israel \u2019 s F-16s . Both of the Israeli pilots in the plane are safe , but one is severely injured due to \u201c an emergency evacuation , \u201d according to the Israeli military . Later on Saturday , the Washington Post reported that the Israeli military launched a \u201c large scale attack \u201d after one of its jets \u201c crashed under Syrian antiaircraft fire . \u201d\nOn Saturday night , the White House put out a statement condemning Syrian hostility and affirming its support for Israel : \u201c Israel is a staunch ally of the United States , and we support its right to defend itself from the Iranian-backed Syrian and militia forces in southern Syria . We call on Iran and its allies to cease provocative actions and work toward regional peace . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s the first time in years , perhaps since the 1980s , that enemy weaponry brought down an Israeli jet .

If true , it would be Israel \u2019 s first direct military confrontation with Iran across the Golan Heights , a demilitarized zone between Israel and Syria .\nIsraeli officials say this situation started because of Iran . \u201c Iran is dragging the region into an adventure in which it doesn \u2019 t know how it will end , \u201d Brig .

That \u2019 s the location of a suspected Syrian facility that produces chemical weapons .\nWe \u2019 ve seen something like this before .
