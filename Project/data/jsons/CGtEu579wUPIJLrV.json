    "content": "Kara is 39 and a half weeks pregnant\u2014and suddenly she \u2019 s rethinking her entire birth plan .\nShe always planned on delivering her baby at the hospital , as she \u2019 d done with her previous two children . She loves her midwife , who collaborates with obstetricians at the hospital near her house in Montgomery County , Maryland . ( Kara did n't want to use her last name because she discusses her health history . )\nBut then she learned that her doula wouldn \u2019 t be able to be with her during the birth , because the hospital would be limiting visitors to one support person during labor and delivery as a result of the coronavirus pandemic . Kara worried that her husband would be banned next . Around the country , hospitals are putting stringent guidelines in place for childbirth ; in New York , several hospitals banned partners entirely . Midwives in New York sharply criticized the move , which they feared could lead to more parents giving birth at home against medical advice . New York Governor Andrew Cuomo overruled the ban via executive order , allowing one support person per birth . Hospitals in the San Francisco Bay Area are also limiting pregnant people to one support person .\nKara \u2019 s hospital is also asking parents in labor to wait outside until they \u2019 ve been screened for COVID-19 , she said . Some doctors are recommending inductions , even before the parent \u2019 s due date , so they can deliver before hospitals are overwhelmed . And , under new guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , parents who test positive for the virus should be separated from their newborns at the hospital .\n\u201c It 's become a procedure , like , get in , get the baby out and get out , \u201d she said . \u201c And I understand why they have to do that , but it is nerve-wracking for me . \u201d\nAnd so , full-term , ready to pop at any moment , she started exploring other options .\nBefore the coronavirus pandemic , a little more than 1 percent of parents delivered their babies at home . But in the face of widespread limitations on hospital births , as well as fears of parents and newborns alike potentially contracting the virus , birth workers said they have seen a spike in interest in home birth . One birth worker in Delaware said she has seen a sevenfold increase in requests\u2014including one from a woman in New Jersey , who said she wasn \u2019 t allowed to switch to a home-birth midwife because she was already full-term . And Google searches for home birth are the highest they 've been in more than five years .\n\u201c There is a comfort , I think , to being in a hospital just in case something does go wrong , \u201d Kara said . \u201c But now with all the stuff that 's in the hospital that could potentially go wrong\u2026 do the benefits outweigh the negatives ? \u201d\nKara decided to speak with a certified nurse midwife\u2014just like the midwife who would have delivered her at the hospital , but one who does home births . If the midwife had any concerns about Kara \u2019 s medical history or switching providers at this late stage , she said , she would unquestionably continue with the hospital plan .\nAlthough labor and delivery wards are usually separate from the emergency rooms and intensive care units where COVID-19 patients are treated , some parents are worried that other people could arrive in the labor and delivery ward with unknown cases\u2014or that health workers could unknowingly have the virus and pass it on to parents or children .\nBut every parent \u2588\u2588\u2588 spoke to was more scared that their support people\u2014partners , family members , and doulas\u2014could be barred from the delivery room than they were about getting the virus . And they \u2019 re worried about developing complications after the birth in a time when some hospitals are discharging patients much earlier than usual , according to news reports and doulas who spoke with \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\n\u201c We 've had a lot of families that are trying to change their options for birth support , \u201d said Heather Delaney , owner and CEO of Maryland State Doulas .\nDelaney said many families have been asking for doula support and advice\u2014should they cancel their baby shower ? Is there anyone who can help them take care of a baby during the postpartum period ? And then the big question : Should I stick to my plans for a hospital birth ?\nHome birth isn \u2019 t the right choice for everyone . For people like Kara , with low-risk pregnancies , uneventful health histories , and previous births that went smoothly , it can be an option when attended by a certified midwife . But those with high-risk pregnancies need to deliver at the hospital . And if complications develop at home , birthing parents need to be transferred to medical care as quickly as possible\u2014which could involve going through an emergency room full of possible COVID-19 patients .\nAnnalise Hume was 40 weeks when she decided to switch to a home birth . She lives in New Jersey , and she wasn \u2019 t able to find a midwife who could deliver in her own home because she was already full-term . Instead , she made plans to give birth at a friend \u2019 s home in Pennsylvania , attended by a certified midwife . But the morning after making all of these plans , her water broke\u2014and she saw meconium , or stool , in the amniotic fluid . That put her and the baby in the high-risk category , so she quickly switched back to the hospital plan . Her baby arrived safely , and he \u2019 s now home with his parents .\n\u201c I know that 's what , in this situation , needed to happen , \u201d she said . \u201c I 'm not gon na play the what-if game because it just does n't help . \u201d\nThere are both benefits and risks to birthing at home , even with a certified midwife , according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ( ACOG ) . In a 2017 report , the ACOG Committee on Obstetric Practice highlighted the fact that high-quality data on home versus hospital birth is limited .\nSome studies , though , show that planned home birth has fewer interventions , like induction and Caesarean section , as well as less tearing and a lower risk of the pregnant person developing a fatal infection , the ACOG committee found . But , compared to hospital birth , it comes with a \u201c more than twofold increased risk of perinatal death \u201d \u2014one to two infant deaths per 1,000 births\u2014and a \u201c threefold increased risk of neonatal seizures or serious neurologic dysfunction \u201d \u2014about one per 2,000 births , they warned .\n\u201c Those are concerning numbers to me , \u201d said Linda Genen , a neonatologist in New York .\n\u201c As a neonatologist , I 've definitely seen when things do n't go well in a home birth , \u201d she said . When it comes to resuscitating a baby or providing other critical care , she said , \u201c seconds matter . \u201d\n\u201c Waiting and getting transported [ to a hospital ] could be devastating , \u201d she said .\nGenen also pointed out that hospital nurses can offer some support in the absence of a partner or doula . \u201c You really do have a lot of support by the actual health care staff who understand even more how scary this can be , \u201d she said . When she gave birth to both of her children , Genen said , the nurses were the ones telling her when to breathe and when to push , while her husband stood by the bedside . \u201c I do n't begrudge him\u2014it was more about the experience\u2014but it really was my nurses who were the ones who helped me through the process , \u201d she said .\nBut the parents \u2588\u2588\u2588 spoke with were nervous that nurses would only check in every half an hour or so during labor , and that health workers may be even busier than usual because of the virus .\nMany of them consider the support of their partners and doulas just as important as the medical check-ins . Kara said having her husband there is an important part of her psychological support , \u201c because a lot of childbirth is mental , \u201d she said . And for her , doulas are \u201c worth their weight in gold , \u201d she said , comparing them to an offensive coordinator in a football game .\nErica Gardner was 36 weeks along when she heard the news that some local hospitals in the Washington , D.C. , area were only allowing one support person ; she worried that soon they would ban all visitors .\n\u201c Without a husband or partner , without a doula , you really are in the room alone , \u201d Gardner said . \u201c Except on the 30-minute marks when the nurse comes to check , and then when you 're ready to push [ and the midwife or obstetrician comes in ] . I just do n't think I could handle being alone during labor like that . \u201d\nHer parents , who are at high risk for COVID-19 , realized that they weren \u2019 t able to travel across several states to help watch their two-year-old grandson during and after the delivery . Faced with no childcare and diminishing labor support , Erica and her husband decided to switch to home birth .\nShe \u2019 s worried about changing the plan so late in the game . \u201c The choice is kind of the best of the worst two choices , \u201d she said . She loves her provider at the hospital . But , she said , this was the only way they could keep everyone together\u2014her husband , her son , her doula , and the new midwife .\nNot everyone is totally changing their birth plan ; others are just tweaking it a little . Vered Asta \u2019 s pregnancy is high-risk , because she developed HELLP Syndrome , a life-threatening complication , with her first , so she knew home birth wasn \u2019 t in the cards for her .\nInstead , the Maryland resident is planning for her doula to offer virtual support through Zoom video conferencing . And she \u2019 s also hoping to get as much postpartum support as possible . At hospitals , she said , \u201c they 're trying to get women in and out , which I have mixed feelings about . \u201d\n\u201c Of course there 's less exposure to germs if you get out quickly , \u201d she said . \u201c But because I developed HELLP syndrome six hours [ after my first birth ] , it 's also a little bit scary to think that I could be heading home and then something could happen . \u201d\nHer parents have already joined her family at home in self-quarantine to help support them after the delivery .\nFor her clients with later births\u2014as far off as September\u2014Delaney compares the birth planning process to packing sandbags for an imminent hurricane . Clients are asking what they should do if their providers \u2019 offices and their local hospitals are hit hard by the pandemic in coming months . Some hospitals in California are already closing their labor and delivery units in order to free up more room for COVID-19 patients .\nThose planning to deliver at hospitals that might later convert to COVID-only care would benefit from having physical copies of their records in the event of a transfer , Delaney said . \u201c No matter when you 're due , get a copy of your health records. \u201d For those switching to home birth , certified midwives aren \u2019 t able to care for patients without knowing their health history , she added .\nHowever , there simply aren \u2019 t enough certified midwives with experience assisting home births to meet the growing demand . Some midwives in the D.C. area are forming impromptu cooperatives to support each other , acting as backups during prenatal visits and labor . \u201c Home birth midwives can not take the same influx as a hospital , \u201d Delaney said .\nShe worries about parents who become fixated on home birth , even when they \u2019 re not able to find a certified midwife to assist them . Completely unassisted birth , or \u201c free birth , \u201d can have devastating outcomes .\n\u201c Free birth is something that does terrify the bejesus out of me , \u201d Delaney said . She \u2019 s had potential clients ask about it recently , and she immediately steers them toward hospitals or home-birth midwives .\n\u201c When you 're not trained , you do n't know what to look for\u2014it could tragically turn , \u201d she said .\nFor years , the United States has had the worst maternal mortality rate in the developed world\u2014and it is even worse for families of color . Some health workers are concerned that this pandemic will only make these outcomes worse .\nIt could also spur lasting changes to the way Americans give birth . For instance , patients and doulas told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that some insurance plans are now completely or mostly covering home births , which they rarely did before .\nAnn Grauer , former president of Doulas of North America ( DONA ) , said this pandemic is revealing longstanding weaknesses in hospitals , where workers are already stretched thin and delivery wards were already frequently near capacity .\n\u201c They have been operating on a shoestring for a very long time , \u201d Grauer said . \u201c And the only reason it has n't completely crashed and burned is we did n't have anything massive happen . \u201d\nNow , the coronavirus is making her seriously question the role hospitals should play in low-risk births . \u201c I have really come to believe that we made a massive mistake by allowing birth to take place primarily in a hospital . And this virus , this pandemic , is showing us why that is a problem , \u201d she said .\n\u201c If the vast majority of our births took place even in a hospital-related birthing center , and then [ we ] brought them into hospital if there was a medical need , we would n't be running into this , \u201d she said , talking about both the need to limit visitors and the possible spread of the coronavirus within hospitals .\nGenen , the neonatologist , also brought up the idea of birthing centers linked to hospitals . \u201c You have a home birth setting , and you 're right there and there are people who can quickly tend to you and the baby\u2014wonderful , \u201d she said .\n\u201c I am a huge fan of midwives and doulas , but I would love to see them practicing in partnership with experienced OBs in a hospital setting , so that everything is there for the just-in-case episode . \u201d\nAccording to one study , integrating midwives into the health system has the best outcomes for both parents and babies .
