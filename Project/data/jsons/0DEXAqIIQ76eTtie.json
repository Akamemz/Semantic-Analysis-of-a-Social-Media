Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz took more shots at Trump in Fox News ' debate -- and through it all , the billionaire businessman seemed to relish standing center stage , defending himself against foes and moderators while showing his mettle to supporters .\nAll three were happy to deflect efforts to drag them into sustained policy discussions and kept things personal . Ohio Gov . John Kasich was content to stand to the side and watch it all .\nMinutes into the debate , Trump was boasting about the size of his penis .\nClearly annoyed that Rubio had joked days ago about the size of Trump 's hands -- suggesting , as Trump put it , that `` if they 're small , something else might be small '' -- the Republican front-runner made a claim seldom heard during a presidential debate .\n`` I guarantee you , there 's no problem . I guarantee you , '' he said .\nIt was a PG-13 start to a two-hour food fight that parents would n't have wanted their kids to watch .\nEarly on , as Rubio pressed Trump for more policy details , the two gave each other nicknames . `` Do n't worry about it , Little Marco , '' Trump said , to which Rubio responded , `` Let 's hear it , Big Donald . ''\nTrump said Florida would n't elect Rubio dogcatcher after all of his missed Senate votes . Cruz gave Trump instructions on letting go of his anger : `` Donald , learn not to interrupt , it 's not complicated . Count to 10 , Donald . Count to 10 . Count to 10 . ''\nLater , when Cruz told Trump to `` breathe , '' Rubio jumped in and joked that the two were doing yoga .\n`` I really hope that we do n't see yoga on this stage , '' Cruz answered .\nAnd then Rubio pointed to Trump , who 'd just admitted his flexibility on policies , and said : `` Well he 's very flexible , so you never know . ''\nThe Republican candidates put on a show -- but not the type they 'd like to play for a general election audience . CNN analyst Amanda Carpenter called it `` embarrassing . '' And pollster Frank Luntz tweeted that 22 of 25 participants in the focus group he led Thursday night predicted the debate would hurt the GOP 's chances in November . `` This has to stop . Seriously , '' he tweeted .\nIt seemed as if Fox News had grown tired of Trump 's opponents ' inability to knock him down -- so the moderators decided to do it themselves .\nChris Wallace had a real-time fact check queued up when Trump asserted he 'd cut $ 500 billion in spending -- pointing out that his strategies , eliminating the Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency ( which Trump called the Department of Environmental Protection ) , would save just a fraction of that amount .\nWhen Trump tried to claim he 'd close the gap by negotiating better drug prices through Medicare , a constant talking point of his , Wallace had a second graphic already prepped pointing out that , too , would n't get Trump even close to eliminating the deficit .

We do n't negotiate . ''\nMegyn Kelly took her shot later on , setting up three clips of Trump taking one policy position and then , days later , taking the opposite position .\nTrump was unmoored , insisting he had logical explanations about his reversals on Syrian refugees , the war in Afghanistan and more -- and that by the way , it does n't matter much anyway .\n`` You have to have a certain degree of flexibility , '' he said .\nTed Cruz needs Trump 's momentum to ebb as much as anyone , but he did n't spend much of the night on the attack . For the most part , Cruz stood aside and watched Rubio and Trump rip each other to shreds , and then turned to the audience and threw up his hands .\n`` Megyn , let me just ask the voters at home : Is this the debate you want playing out in the general election ?
