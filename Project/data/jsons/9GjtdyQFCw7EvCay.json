Democrats made several efforts to obtain Trump 's returns while in the minority , only to be rejected by House Republicans .\nTrump would likely seek to stall those requests with legal challenges , and it remains unclear whether Democrats could publicly release his tax returns even if they obtained them for investigative purposes .\nBefore a rally in Indiana on Monday , Trump brushed off the threat . `` I do n't care , '' he said . `` They can do whatever they want , and I can do whatever I want . ''\nRep. Jerry Nadler , the Democrat who was projected to win New York 's 10th congressional district , warned Trump in a tweet his administration would be `` held accountable .
