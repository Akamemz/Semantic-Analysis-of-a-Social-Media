    "content": "Getty CONGRESS House GOP obsessed with Boehner 's future The speaker 's allies believe he 's being blackmailed by hardliners .\nSpeaker John Boehner says he \u2019 s not worried about his political future , but the Ohio Republican \u2019 s fate has become an overwhelming obsession of House Republicans . His backers believe Boehner is being \u201c blackmailed \u201d by conservative hard-liners into supporting a government shutdown . His critics insist they just want their leader to do the right thing .\nThe latest flash point for Boehner is the controversy over federal funding for Planned Parenthood . Hard-line conservative Republicans want Boehner to do whatever it takes to shut off funding for the group , even if it means a shutdown . They \u2019 re vowing to vote against any spending bill that allows such funding to continue .\nThe warning to Boehner is obvious : The speaker can either do what they want on Planned Parenthood , or they \u2019 ll force a vote to replace him .\nYet to hear Boehner \u2019 s friends and supporters tell it , the Ohio Republican is essentially being threatened into supporting a shutdown with no realistic plan on how to win the fight , which they liken to a repeat of the 2013 government closure over Obamacare . These GOP insiders say Boehner has no intention of provoking a showdown with President Barack Obama and Democrats that can result only in a Republican defeat . In the view of many in leadership , including Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) , it \u2019 s a battle that needs to take place on something other than a must-pass government funding bill .\nThe disagreement shows just how bad the situation is for Boehner right now . Every piece of legislation that Republican leaders put on the floor , or even think about putting up for a vote , is viewed through the prism of whether it will trigger an effort by conservative hard-liners to replace Boehner . The Ohio Republican \u2019 s allies and leadership aides believe there could be a showdown on whether Boehner can remain as speaker in the next few weeks .\n\u201c My position has been this month will be telling with what \u2019 s going to happen , \u201d said Rep. Ra\u00fal Labrador ( R-Idaho ) , among the most vocal members of the House Freedom Caucus , a hotbed of anti-Boehner opposition . \u201c If we \u2019 re going to do business as usual , it is going to be very difficult for me to continue with the same leadership that we have now . \u201d\nTwenty-five Republicans voted against Boehner for speaker back in January , and Rep. Mark Meadows ( R-N.C. ) reignited the debate when he proposed a motion to \u201c vacate the chair \u201d in late July , essentially calling a vote on whether Boehner should continue as speaker . Those close to Boehner say they expect Meadows or another hard-liner to offer the motion again in coming weeks , depending on what happens with Planned Parenthood . Or it could be offered when Boehner moves to increase the federal debt later this fall or early next year . Or any other time . The shoe is going to drop , these members say , it \u2019 s just a matter of time .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a fuse burning , and things are going to blow up soon , \u201d added a GOP lawmaker close to Republican leaders . \u201c It \u2019 s not if it will blow up . The only question is when . \u201d\nBoehner and other House GOP leaders are holding a Republican Conference meeting on Wednesday where they will discuss the Planned Parenthood issue , the latest in a series of \u201c listening sessions \u201d that leadership has convened on the topic . Boehner and his top lieutenants have already floated holding a separate vote on Planned Parenthood while several House committees continue to investigate the organization \u2019 s activities . They are pushing alternative legislation offered by Rep. Diane Black ( R-Tenn. ) to impose a \u201c moratorium \u201d on any federal funds going to Planned Parenthood for one year . The Black bill is set to be voted on later this week , although Senate Democrats are expected to prevent it from being taken up in that chamber .\nBoehner aides also said no decision will be made on a continuing resolution to fund the government past the Sept. 30 deadline until House Republicans agree on how to handle Planned Parenthood . McConnell told \u2588\u2588\u2588 last week that he wants to see a CR passed that funds the government until early December , and a similar target date has been floated among House leadership .\n\u201c It \u2019 s clear we need to let the pressure build up a little bit more , and we \u2019 re not there yet , \u201d said a GOP leadership aide close to the issue .\nA vote over whether Boehner should remain speaker is not an easy one for many members , and Boehner is aware of the problem for his rank and file back home . Boehner is also unpopular with the right-wing media and outside conservative groups , which see him as an outdated relic of the Republican establishment that needs to be replaced .\nYet the reality is that Boehner \u2014 who is still personally popular with the vast majority of members \u2014 may be the only Republican who can handle the competing pressures within the GOP Conference . Any realistic replacement \u2014 such as Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( R-Calif. ) or Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan ( R-Wis. ) \u2014 would not have any more political latitude to operate than Boehner has had .\nThere are also some Republicans who see the Boehner controversy as an unnecessary distraction that interferes with their broader effort to rein in Obama \u2019 s agenda , such as the president \u2019 s so-far successful push to enact the nuclear deal with Iran .\n\u201c The American people are tired of all of the conference infighting .
