Barber \u2019 s piece relied heavily on a statistic used by the White House , comparing the median salaries of all men working full-time for a full year to their female counterparts . The NRCC used the same math with Barber \u2019 s congressional staff , calculating the disparity for the 10 employees working in his office last year full-time for the entire year The NRCC says that using the White House formula , it found that the Tucson Democrat is not paying his female staffers as much as their male counterparts . Barber is paying women roughly $ 8,950 a year less than their male counterparts , said NRCC Regional Political Director Annie Kelly .\nSo here you have an NRCC-funded \u201c news \u201d website excerpting an Arizona Daily Star article reporting on the NRCC \u2019 s attacks on Barber .
