Trump sprays insults with abandon , mocking everything from his critics \u2019 intelligence to their popularity to their ethics to their plastic surgery , but those who engage with the president of the United States on his own level make themselves look smaller and meaner , and they are never able to go as low for as long as Trump .\n\u201c Of course one could say that Trump is at fault , \u201d York writes . Yes , one could . York doesn \u2019 t so much reject that possibility as rule it out as a category error . Unlike most people , whose behavior is bounded by shame and thus amenable to criticism , Trump is truly shameless , and thus criticizing his behavior is useless . \u201c Trump is Trump , \u201d York writes . \u201c He does what he does . \u201d\nYork has a point . Trump takes such glee in conflict , and cares so little for standards of decency or compassion , that his assailants often diminish themselves by betraying their own values out of desperation . But this isn \u2019 t just true of Trump \u2019 s assailants . It is true of all of us . To consistently engage with Trump is to be diminished by him . And we have all been diminished by his presidency .\nWe are diminished when our president lies , and even more so when we begin taking his habitual lying for granted . The New York Times published a comprehensive list of falsehoods Trump told since taking office and found it wasn \u2019 t until March that Trump went a full day without saying something flatly untrue . The absence of public dishonesty , for Trump , is usually driven by an absence of opportunity to be publicly dishonest . \u201c On days without an untrue statement , he is often absent from Twitter , vacationing at Mar-a-Lago in Florida , or busy golfing , \u201d the Times found .\nWe are diminished when our president uses cyberbullying as a communications strategy , spending his mornings picking childish fights on Twitter and coming up with insulting nicknames for his enemies . It is impossible to imagine the firestorm that would have followed Barack Obama or Bill Clinton mocking a television anchor \u2019 s plastic surgery . But in this White House , press officers justify the president \u2019 s insults by saying he \u201c fights fire with fire. \u201d The president is teaching our children that bullies win so long as they never , ever back down .\nWe are diminished when our president spends his time and energy \u2014 and thus the nation \u2019 s time and energy \u2014 on the wrong issues . At Axios , Mike Allen notes Trump has tweeted the words \u201c opioid \u201d or \u201c opioids \u201d just once \u2014 but \u201c loser \u201d 234 times , and \u201c dumb \u201d or \u201c dummy \u201d 222 times . Political capital is finite , and our future is harmed when it is squandered .\nWe are diminished when the president knows nothing about the issues he faces , and does not try to learn more .
