On Friday at noon , Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts will swear in Donald Trump as the country \u2019 s 45th president . On Wednesday , in his last press conference as president , Obama defended his decision to commute the sentence of Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning , and condemned the Israeli occupation . He also warned Trump that he will not stay silent if Obama sees what he called the nation \u2019 s core values at risk .\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : But there \u2019 s a difference between that normal functioning of politics and certain issues or certain moments where I think our core values may be at stake . I put in that category if I saw systematic discrimination being ratified in some fashion . I put in that category explicit or functional obstacles to people being able to vote , to exercise their franchise . I put in that category institutional efforts to silence dissent or the press . And for me , at least , I would put in that category efforts to round up kids who have grown up here and , for all practical purposes , are American kids , and send them someplace else , when they love this country . They are our kids \u2019 friends and their classmates and are now entering into community colleges or , in some cases , serving in our military . The notion that we would just arbitrarily , or because of politics , punish those kids , when they didn \u2019 t do anything wrong themselves , I think , would be something that would merit me speaking out . It doesn \u2019 t mean that I would get on the ballot anywhere .\nAMY GOODMAN : We begin today \u2019 s show looking back at Obama \u2019 s legacy and what lies ahead with the new administration . We \u2019 re joined by two guests . Here in New York , Rashid Khalidi , the Edward Said professor of Arab studies at Columbia University , author of several books , his most recent , Brokers of Deceit : How the U.S. Has Undermined Peace in the Middle East . And at Princeton University , we \u2019 re joined by Eddie Glaude , chair of the Department of African American Studies . He \u2019 s author of a number of books , most recently , Democracy in Black : How Race Still Enslaves the American Soul , which is just out in paperback .\nProfessor Glaude , let \u2019 s begin with you . Your assessment of President Obama \u2019 s message in this last news conference , in the last 48 hours that he was president , holding it in the press pool room\u2014something that has been threatened , to say the least , in the last few days with the Trump administration saying they were thinking of moving the press somewhere nearby ?\nEDDIE GLAUDE : Well , I think it was important for the president to kind of identify the threat that Donald Trump poses to the fourth estate . He did it in his own unique and , of course , centrist way , but the idea of calling attention to the fact that a free and independent press may very well be under siege as Donald Trump enters the White House , I think , is an important\u2014was an important\u2014an important gesture . I would\u2014you know , I would want to caution , though , that the way in which the president made the point , he , of course , wasn \u2019 t attentive to the corporate dimensions of the press , that in some ways the so-called free press has been compromised by big money , by its own pursuit of profits . And so , it \u2019 s a critique that only goes so far .\nAnd then I think to kind of point his attention or point our attention or direct our attention to the question of Israel and Palestine , the issues around the DREAMers , issues around race or continued inequality , the issues around LGBTQ\u2014right ? \u2014communities , I think , was important as a way of , in some ways , framing his own presidency over and against what is to come . But I have this fear , though , Sister Amy , that he \u2019 s positioning himself as , in some ways , the voice of a kind of resistance post his presidency . And I worry about that because of\u2014because of his containing and limiting voice , you know , because President Obama , at the end of the day , is just simply a centrist liberal .\nAMY GOODMAN : During his press conference , President Obama criticized the voting restrictions in place in the United States .\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : We are the only country in the advanced world that makes it harder to vote rather than easier . And that dates back . There is a\u2014there is an ugly history to that , that we should not be shy about talking about .\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : Yes , I \u2019 m talking about voting rights . The reason that we are the only country among advanced democracies that makes it harder to vote is\u2014it traces directly back to Jim Crow and the legacy of slavery , and it became sort of acceptable to restrict the franchise .\nAMY GOODMAN : President Obama dismissed the idea of voting fraud as fake news .\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : This whole notion of election\u2014or , voting fraud , this is something that has constantly been disproved . This\u2014this is fake news , the notion that there are a whole bunch of people out there who are going out there and are not eligible to vote and want to vote . We have the opposite problem : We have a whole bunch of people who are eligible to vote who don \u2019 t vote .\nEDDIE GLAUDE : [ inaudible ] But again\u2014again , I think his analysis is limited . I mean , to the extent to which the question of voter fraud or voter suppression , tracing its origins back to Jim Crow and slavery , giving it\u2014giving attention to its racial underpinnings is right . But there \u2019 s a reluctance , though , to speak to voter suppression\u2014right ? \u2014the ways in which voter ID laws are directly targeting black communities , what happened in North Carolina , what happened in Wisconsin , what happens\u2014what tried to happen\u2014what Texas tried to do , what Pennsylvania attempted to do . And to speak specifically to the ways in which race , and particularly the way black and brown communities are targeted today , there \u2019 s a reluctance . So , in other words , you get this kind of general claim about an assault on voting rights , that we \u2019 re making it more difficult for people to vote , tracing it specifically to Jim Crow and the institution of slavery , but a reluctance to name specifically the ways in which Republicans across the country have targeted black and brown voters in very distinct ways . I mean , the court was very clear in North Carolina , what North Carolina Republicans were doing . And instead , at this point , instead of making that move\u2014and again , I want to begin by saying he \u2019 s right to give the historical backdrop to the question of trying to limit voting in the United States , but instead of kind of pointing our attention to what specifically is happening around race , and particularly with regards to people of color , today , he wants to say that people have the right to vote , but they don \u2019 t vote . Right ? So it \u2019 s a kind of , again , on the one hand and then on the other , without him really going to the core of the problem .\nAMY GOODMAN : President Obama also warned of the dangers of rising inequality .\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : I worry about inequality , because I think that if we are not investing in making sure everybody plays a role in this economy , the economy will not grow as fast , and I think it will also lead to further and further separation between us as Americans , and not just along racial lines . I mean , there are a whole bunch of folks who voted for the president-elect because they feel forgotten and disenfranchised . They feel as if they \u2019 re being looked down on . They feel as if their kids aren \u2019 t going to have the same opportunities as they did .\nAMY GOODMAN : Professor Eddie Glaude , if you could comment on what he \u2019 s saying and also where we have been and where we \u2019 re headed ?\nEDDIE GLAUDE : Well , look , it \u2019 s one thing for President Obama to point to increasing inequality in the country , and it \u2019 s another thing for us to look at his policies . When we look at over the last\u2014when we kind of assess the last eight years , what we \u2019 ve seen is that you \u2019 ve had a series of policies that really have benefited Wall Street and left Main Street behind . We have a policy that is , in some ways , fit\u2014it fits perfectly with the increasing financialization of our economy , that \u2019 s really tailored for the top 1 percent and top 0.01 percent . And there \u2019 s kind of modest gains for everyday , ordinary people working . Even if they tout job creation , we know , from one of my colleagues here at Princeton , that 95 percent of the jobs created over the last 15-plus years have been part-time and contractual work . So people are working harder and earning less . So , there \u2019 s one thing to point to inequality , but there \u2019 s another thing to kind of look to the policies that he has supported and pushed that \u2019 s produced inequality . That \u2019 s the first thing .\nAnd the second thing\u2014the second move that we have to kind of be very , very careful about is the way in which he always engages in this equivalency . Right ? We have to pay attention to the fact that there are some white voters out there who voted for Donald Trump who are catching hell . Of course there are white voters out there who have lost ground , who have suffered in this economy . But at the same time , we have to be mindful that 53 percent of black wealth over the last eight years has just simply been wiped off the planet . It \u2019 s gone . And it has a lot to do with housing policy , has a lot to do with his failure over the last eight years to really address the racialized dimensions of the housing crisis . And so , I really want us to say that he \u2019 s right to point to inequality , but I \u2019 m not sure he \u2019 s the right messenger to point to inequality , if that makes sense .\nNow , where do we\u2014where are we now , and where are we going ? Well , we have deepening racial inequality . We have deepening economic inequality . We have a neo-fascist who is about to be inaugurated . We have the billionaires and millionaires who are about to take over government . What we are in , in some ways , is a conjunctural moment where crisis opens up space for us to put forward a more progressive vision of what this country could and ought to be . So we need to prepare ourselves for day one , as Donald Trump ascends , and attack the policies that , in some ways , Barack Obama \u2019 s administration , Clintonism broadly , has made possible .",
