He popped off on the \u201c Jewish lobby \u201d and a gay Clinton nominee . His fellow Republicans will never forget the relish with which he lectured them on the flaws of the Iraq War \u2014 after he voted to authorize it .\nPolicy aside , Hagel \u2019 s bedeviled by his own abrasive personality . In a chamber known for back-patting and elbow-rubbing , the former Nebraska senator mostly rubbed people the wrong way . Now , on his path to the Pentagon , he has to hope that irritation doesn \u2019 t come back to bite him .\n\u201c He was respected as a colleague in the normal Senate tradition but was somewhat of a lone wolf and did not forge the deep personal relationships with his fellow Republicans that would translate into a ready reservoir of support for his nomination , \u201d said John Ullyot , a former Marine intelligence officer who was the spokesman for the Senate Armed Services Committee under Chairman John Warner from 2003 to 2007 . \u201c On top of that , his outspokenness and blunt criticism of several Republican priorities at a critical time , including Iraq and Iran , while sincere and heartfelt , have left him without a natural platform of enthusiasm for his confirmation . \u201d\nThose hurdles \u201c are not insurmountable , \u201d Ullyot added . \u201c But he starts the process with a long and uncharted road ahead . \u201d\nIn the past , a former senator could count on getting a gentleman \u2019 s confirmation vote from his old club . But Hagel can \u2019 t even count on a fellow Republican Cornhusker to give him a hand .\nOne vote that will be tough for Hagel to win : that of fellow Nebraska Republican Deb Fischer . Hagel crossed party lines to back Fischer \u2019 s Democratic opponent , former Sen. Bob Kerrey , in 2012 . Now , Fischer sits in judgment of Hagel as a freshman member of the Armed Services Committee , the panel that will handle his confirmation hearing .\nIn a statement released Monday , Fischer hinted at what could be the ultimate spectacle of a Hagel confirmation hearing : her chance to question him directly from behind the dais .\n\u201c I plan to closely review Senator Hagel \u2019 s record and look forward to meeting with him to discuss his views on America \u2019 s role in an increasingly dangerous world . As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , I will also have the opportunity to publicly question Senator Hagel during his confirmation hearing in the coming weeks , \u201d she said . \u201c This process will be thorough and fair , and I look forward to participating in it . \u201d\nPresident Barack Obama acknowledged Hagel \u2019 s rougher edges in praising his independence during a White House ceremony on Monday afternoon .\n\u201c In the Senate , I came to admire his courage and his judgment , his willingness to speak his mind , even if it wasn \u2019 t popular , even if it defied the conventional wisdom , and that \u2019 s exactly the spirit I want on my national security team \u2014 a recognition that when it comes to the defense of our country , we are not Democrats or Republicans , we are Americans , \u201d Obama said .\nOften , it wasn \u2019 t just Hagel \u2019 s thinking that proved unpopular . It was his way of doing business .\n\u201c Chuck always marched to his own drum when he was in the Senate . Even by Senate terms , he tended to be very much a freelancer . He ended up rubbing some people the wrong way by doing that , \u201d said former Sen. Judd Gregg ( R-N.H. ) , an early first-term Obama choice to lead the Commerce Department who withdrew because of policy differences .\nThe combination of raw nerves among his old colleagues and policy concerns among junior senators have cast doubt on Hagel \u2019 s confirmation process , which could prove to be the trickiest for a Pentagon pick since Texas Sen. John Tower was rejected , 47-53 , in 1989 . He was the last Cabinet nominee to lose a vote on the Senate floor , though others have since been withdrawn . A handful of Democratic senators , including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D-Nev. ) , threw their support to Hagel on Monday . But Obama and Hagel could count themselves lucky when a senator keeps his or her powder dry .\n\u201c Sen . Hagel is a war hero who served our country honorably and was prescient in his questioning of the Iraq War . But we must look at his entire public-service record in its totality in the upcoming confirmation hearings , \u201d said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand , a New York Democrat who is sometimes mentioned as a potential presidential candidate . \u201c Considering some of the statements Sen. Hagel has made and votes he has cast , particularly regarding Iran policy , tough questions must and will be asked to clarify his views before these hearings are complete . I look forward to a fair and thorough process . \u201d\nThough Hagel has apologized since his name first surfaced for the Pentagon gig , he once derided as \u201c openly and aggressively gay \u201d another presidential nominee : Ambassador James Hormel . Since the apology , he has gained the support of Barney Frank , the former Democratic Massachusetts congressman who is lobbying Gov . Deval Patrick for an appointment to temporarily fill Sen. John Kerry \u2019 s seat if he \u2019 s confirmed as secretary of state .\nFreshman Wisconsin Democrat Tammy Baldwin , the first openly gay member of the Senate , told MSNBC on Monday that she still has questions about Hagel \u2019 s views , particularly now that the \u201c don \u2019 t ask , don \u2019 t tell \u201d policy regarding gays and lesbians in the military has been repealed .\n\u201c I do want to speak with him , particularly about his comments 14 years ago , to see if his apology is sincere and sufficient , \u201d Baldwin said on MSNBC \u2019 s \u201c Andrea Mitchell Reports. \u201d \u201c I want to hear how he \u2019 s evolved on this issue in the last 14 years . \u201d\nAnd while Hagel \u2019 s record reflects some support for Israel , he has come under fire for opposing certain sanctions on Iran and referring to the \u201c Jewish lobby \u201d \u2014 rather than the pro-Israel lobby \u2014 in an interview for a controversial book about the influence of pro-Israel forces in Washington .\n\u201c This is an in-your-face nomination by the president to all of us who are supportive of Israel , \u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-S.C. ) said on CNN on Sunday , when it was already clear that Obama would tap Hagel .\nHagel told the Lincoln Journal Star on Monday that his record has been \u201c completely distorted \u201d by his critics and that he has shown \u201c unequivocal , total support for Israel . \u201d\nReid released a comparatively tepid endorsement of Hagel , and several Democrats released statements making clear that they were not ready to endorse the president \u2019 s pick for the top national security position in his administration .\nThe reaction to Hagel \u2019 s nomination was like the night to the day of Kerry \u2019 s selection to run the State Department late last month .\n\u201c I am surprised and disappointed President Obama has chosen to move forward with Sen. Hagel \u2019 s nomination given the significant concerns that both Democrats and Republicans in the Senate have expressed about Sen.
