    "content": "The range of predicted future warming is enormous \u2014 apocalyptism is unwarranted .\nThe epithet \u201c climate denier , \u201d intended to invoke Holocaust denial , has always been tasteless and inapt . Climate change is not like the Holocaust , nor is questioning the accuracy and predictive power of a scientific model like questioning the historical fact of a genocide that murdered 6 million Jews . But climate activists delighted in defining their opposition this way , with help from prominent figures such as Barack Obama , who in 2014 used Twitter to condemn \u201c climate change deniers \u201d and promote a website , run by Organizing for Action ( formerly Obama for America ) , that featured large black-and-white pictures of then\u2013House speaker John Boehner and Senator Marco Rubio atop a green \u201c Climate Change Deniers \u201d banner . \u201c On climate , \u201d asked the site \u2019 s headline , \u201c whose side are you on ? \u201d\nFor a while , this seemed to work . Framing the climate debate as one between noble keepers of the scientific flame and people akin to Nazis gave the former group license to say almost anything . To the casual observer , even the most egregious exaggeration about climate science could seem reasonable compared with its outright rejection . Thus , Obama \u2019 s assertion in his 2015 State of the Union address that \u201c no challenge \u2014 no challenge \u2014 poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change \u201d became widely accepted . When Senator Bernie Sanders warned during a presidential debate that \u201c the scientific community is telling us that if we do not address the global crisis of climate change . . . the planet that we \u2019 re going to be leaving our kids and our grandchildren may well not be habitable , \u201d he was not laughed off the stage .\nOften , the politicians and pundits targeted with the \u201c denier \u201d label did deserve blame . Ignoring the best available scientific research \u2014 an obvious starting point in any other policy debate \u2014 was irresponsible or dishonest . Their arguments rarely emerged from any valuable scientific insight , but usually from a fear that acknowledging the scientific basis of climate change would mean accepting radical and costly responses . This was doubly counterproductive : Not only did it grant by default a mainstream foothold to outlandishly overblown climate fears , but also it sidelined and undermined more important and compelling policy-based objections to the activist agenda .\nAnd then a funny thing happened : \u201c Denial \u201d gave way to those more reasoned arguments . Perhaps the accumulation of scientific evidence changed minds . Perhaps it was only the political reality that sank in . Regardless , opponents of aggressive climate policy mostly stopped questioning whether the climate was warming and whether human activity played a role \u2014 the two points of agreement that define the famous \u201c 97 percent consensus \u201d of climate scientists \u2014 and started explaining why that consensus did not justify costly and ineffective policies .\nThis shift in focus from the basic science of climate change to its public-policy implications has been a disaster for climate activists , exposing the flabbiness at the core of their position . Softened by years of punching down at their opponents \u2019 worst arguments , they became addicted to asserting that \u201c science says so , \u201d and they are now lost when it doesn \u2019 t .\nWhen Sanders , back in the Senate , questioned Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt during the latter \u2019 s confirmation hearing to lead the Environmental Protection Agency , it was the interrogator who couldn \u2019 t keep his facts straight . Pruitt asserted that \u201c the climate is changing , and human activity contributes to that in some manner , \u201d explaining that he had inserted the caveat ( \u201c in some manner \u201d ) because \u201c the ability to measure , with precision , the degree of human activity \u2019 s impact on the climate is subject to more debate. \u201d Pressed by Sanders , he stated again : \u201c The climate is changing , and human activity impacts that . \u201d\nPruitt wanted to discuss \u201c the job of the [ EPA ] administrator , \u201d which he noted was \u201c to carry out the statutes passed by [ Congress ] . \u201d He also agreed that the \u201c EPA has a very important role at regulating the emission of CO2. \u201d But Sanders was determined to show that Pruitt rejected the scientific consensus , even if this meant falsifying the contents of that consensus .\nFraming the climate debate as one between noble keepers of the scientific flame and people akin to Nazis gave the former group license to say almost anything .\nSanders claimed that \u201c 97 percent of the scientists who wrote articles in peer-reviewed journals believe that human activity is the fundamental reason we are seeing climate change. \u201d That is wrong . A survey-of-surveys published last year in Environmental Research Letters reported that prior surveys had found 78 percent of scientists agreeing that \u201c the cause of global warming over the past 150 years was mostly human , \u201d 82 percent agreeing that \u201c human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures , \u201d and 85 percent agreeing that \u201c anthropogenic greenhouse gases are the dominant driver of recent global warming. \u201d Of course , even among those expressing agreement about the \u201c significant \u201d or \u201c dominant \u201d human role , debate would presumably have emerged about whether natural factors accounted for 0 , 10 , 25 , or 50 percent .\nSanders also claimed that \u201c 97 percent of scientists who have written articles for peer-reviewed journals have concluded that climate change is real , it is caused by human activity , and it is already causing devastating problems in our country and around the world. \u201d As to the devastating problems , this also is false . He said \u201c the vast majority of scientists are telling us that if we do not get our act together and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel , there is a real question as to the quality of the planet that we are going to be leaving our children and our grandchildren. \u201d Also untrue .\nIn fact , scientists and economists hold widely varying views on the costs that climate change has caused and will cause . Surveys of scientists rarely address social consequences or policy implications . When President Obama tweeted that \u201c Ninety-seven percent of scientists agree : # climate change is real , man-made and dangerous , \u201d even Salon had to acknowledge he was wrong to say \u201c dangerous. \u201d Only half of the economists surveyed by NYU \u2019 s Institute for Policy Integrity in 2015 believed \u201c immediate and drastic action is necessary \u201d on climate change ; only 56 percent said that \u201c if nothing is done to limit climate change in the future \u201d it would be a \u201c very serious \u201d problem for the United States ; only 41 percent believed \u201c climate change is already having a negative effect on the global economy . \u201d\nBut the New York Times had categorized the Pruitt nomination under the heading climate change denial , albeit without any support . So when Pruitt testified , Times reporter Coral Davenport tweeted , \u201c # Pruitt on # climate : \u2018 Science tells us climate is changing \u2019 but says extent of human role is up for debate . False. \u201d In her accompanying story , she reported that Pruitt \u2019 s views were \u201c not consistent with the scientific consensus \u201d as reflected by the U.N. \u2019 s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .\nOnly half of the economists surveyed by NYU \u2019 s Institute for Policy Integrity in 2015 believed \u2018 immediate and drastic action is necessary \u2019 on climate change .\nWhat does the IPCC actually say ? While it is \u201c extremely likely that human activities caused more than half of the observed increase in [ temperature ] from 1951 to 2010 , \u201d the attribution for the approximately 0.6\u00b0C of warming requires wide ranges that are \u201c likely \u201d to be accurate : between 0.5 and 1.3\u00b0C for greenhouse gases , between \u2013 0.6 and + 0.1\u00b0C for other human activity , and between \u2013 0.1 and + 0.1\u00b0C apiece for natural causes and internal variability . For the slower warming observed during the period from 1998 to 2012 , the IPCC could offer only low to medium confidence in its explanation .\nSo Pruitt \u2019 s comments were not \u201c False. \u201d Indeed , in a later story Davenport \u2019 s colleague Justin Gillis acknowledged that Pruitt \u2019 s position was \u201c almost axiomatically true. \u201d But , Gillis argued , it remained problematic because\nanybody who did not know better might come away thinking there is room to doubt whether humans are the main cause of global warming . Mr. Pruitt did not actually say that , of course .. . . Mr. Pruitt and the other Trump nominees labored to avoid overt denial while signaling to their allies that there is enough doubt to justify inaction on emissions or even rolling back steps the Obama administration took .\nThis is the crux of the matter . Statements about climate change are no longer being policed for their accuracy , but rather for the degree to which they help or harm the activist agenda . The Atlantic explains that \u201c the new climate denial is like the old climate denial \u201d because \u201c both are excuses for inaction. \u201d Why didn \u2019 t Sanders ask Pruitt the obvious follow-ups : \u201c Do you see that lack of precision as relevant to the policy choices facing us ? \u201d or \u201c Of course , science is always subject to imprecision , but do you believe we should take action to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions ? \u201d Sanders didn \u2019 t ask these questions because he had no interest in discussing climate policy , where his own ideas make no sense ( including , for instance , banning nuclear power and \u201c bringing climate deniers to justice \u201d ) . His position rests on the fiction that scientists unanimously agree , and that is where he must make his stand .\nPruitt \u2019 s emphasis on the difficulty of measuring , \u201c with precision , the degree of human activity \u2019 s impact \u201d also crosses a red line for activists , because the precision with which climate models can describe what is happening links directly to the precision with which they can describe what will happen . If scientists do not know exactly how the climate system is behaving now , we might accord less weight to their projections into the distant future .\nThe precision with which climate models can describe what is happening links directly to the precision with which they can describe what will happen .\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson hit that tripwire in his own confirmation hearing when he said : \u201c The increase in the greenhouse-gas concentrations in the atmosphere are [ sic ] having an effect ; our ability to predict that effect is very limited. \u201d Professor Katharine Hayhoe mocked the claim , suggesting that perhaps it would have been correct in the 1800s . \u201c In 2017 ? Not so much. \u201d Professor Michael Mann called it \u201c indefensible. \u201d In the Guardian , Dana Nuccitelli concluded , \u201c Functionally [ Tillerson ] might not be very different than a Secretary of State who outright denies climate change. \u201d Mashable \u2019 s Andrew Freedman warned that Tillerson , Pruitt , and fellow Trump nominee Rick Perry had \u201c moved from outright climate denial to a more subtle , insidious and risky form . \u201d\nBut as the IPCC emphasizes , the range for future projections remains enormous . The central question is \u201c climate sensitivity \u201d \u2014 the amount of warming that accompanies a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere . As of its Fifth Assessment Report in 2013 , the IPCC could estimate only that this sensitivity is somewhere between 1.5 and 4.5\u00b0C . Nor is science narrowing that range . The 2013 assessment actually widened it on the low end , from a 2.0\u20134.5\u00b0C range in the prior assessment . And remember , for any specific level of warming , forecasts vary widely on the subsequent environmental and economic implications .\nAt least one might assume that reasonable minds could be allowed to differ on the ultimate question of how well society is likely to cope with the effects of climate change \u2014 a political , social , and economic question several degrees removed from anything resembling a scientific consensus . Not so . I addressed these issues in a recent Foreign Affairs essay , in which I called the IPCC \u201c the gold-standard summary , \u201d cited it repeatedly , and adopted its estimate that temperatures could rise by 3 to 4\u00b0C this century . My essay further embraced the Obama administration \u2019 s \u201c Social Cost of Carbon \u201d analysis and adopted its high-case model for economic cost . But the essay argued that the likely impact of all this was \u201c manageable \u201d rather than \u201c catastrophic. \u201d Mann decried it as \u201c # Koch climate denial propaganda. \u201d Eric Holthaus , meteorologist and host of the podcast Our Warm Regards , called it \u201c a master class in modern climate denial . \u201d\nThe scope of viewpoints that constitute \u201c denial \u201d is rapidly expanding to swallow all opposition to favored climate policies . In Scientific American , blogger Peter Dykstra declared \u201c grudgingly admitting the problem while scrambling to avoid addressing it \u201d to be a form of climate denial . Writing in Rolling Stone , Bill McKibben pathetically attempted to introduce the term \u201c Renewables Denial \u201d ( \u201c at least as ugly and insidious as its twin sister , Climate Denial \u201d ) to describe skepticism that wind and solar power can meet the world \u2019 s energy needs anytime soon .\nAt stake are the boundaries of debate in our democratic society , on an issue that the self-appointed enforcers insist is the most important one facing us . The ad hominem \u201c denier \u201d criticism places arguments and their purveyors beyond the pale , unworthy of response . Appealing to a purported \u201c 97 percent consensus \u201d asserts that the question has been scientifically answered and policymakers have no business debating it . Such rhetorical techniques are wildly inappropriate where science is in fact , by its own admission , not settled , and especially where science is but one input to a difficult policy question .\nScience is but one input to a difficult policy question .\nFortunately , this nonsense is unsustainable . The Times tried letting people speak for themselves , introducing quotes from twelve of Trump \u2019 s Cabinet nominees with the summary : \u201c Most of the people President-elect Donald J. Trump has chosen for the top tiers of his administration have expressed doubt that climate change is caused by human activity. \u201d But anyone who actually read the quotes discovered that most of them raised no issues with climate science at all .\nIn early March , Davenport tried calling Trump appointees \u201c skeptics , \u201d rather than \u201c deniers. \u201d But Gillis summarized her story , headlined \u201c EPA Head Stacks Agency with Climate Change Skeptics , \u201d in a tweet as \u201c Top posts at EPA are being stocked with climate-change denialists. \u201d He then acknowledged that the conflicting word choices were no accident and that the Times \u201c can not seem to achieve internal consistency about what word to use , despite best efforts. \u201d That was awkward , though not as awkward as Professor Michael Mann \u2019 s testimony before the House Science Committee later that month : \u201c I don \u2019 t believe I called anybody here a denier , \u201d he asserted , \u201c yet that \u2019 s been stated over and over again . So I \u2019 ve been misrepresented quite a bit today. \u201d To which Professor Judith Curry , sitting just to his right , responded , \u201c It \u2019 s in your written testimony. \u201d Sure enough , on page 6 , Mann referred to \u201c climate science denier Judith Curry , \u201d even averring , \u201c I use the term carefully . \u201d\nActivists , so eager to bar the gates to the public square and keep their opponents out , have instead locked themselves in . If everyone agrees with the 97 percent consensus , and that consensus does not dictate any particular policy outcome , they have nothing else to say . Perhaps this is for the best . If the extremists from both sides become sufficiently marginalized , a reasoned policy debate might emerge about the real risks of climate change and the cost-effective responses . This would require the media to admit that their \u201c denier \u201d terminology has lost all meaning and to attend equally to the scientifically unsupported statements from both sides .\nIt would also require a consistent , scientifically accurate message from the White House . The president should clean up the embarrassing ambiguity and vacuity in his own views . And his administration should make clear that it works from mainstream scientific conclusions . EPA Administrator Pruitt confused matters greatly with comments to CNBC last month that went beyond his testimony about \u201c precision \u201d and \u201c debate \u201d and suggested that human activity was not the primary cause of recent warming . Pruitt had no basis for taking that position , nor does he gain anything from it ; even Fox News confronted him . Conversely , an accurate statement of the science would only strengthen his position in defending the policies he seeks to implement . The more he focuses discussion on costs and benefits of EPA actions , the more reasonable he will seem \u2014 and the more reasonable he will be .\nFor now , though , navigating the climate debate will require translating the phrase \u201c climate denier \u201d to mean \u201c anyone unsympathetic to the most aggressive activists \u2019 claims. \u201d This apparently includes anyone who acknowledges meaningful uncertainty in climate models , adopts a less-than-catastrophic outlook about the consequences of future warming , or opposes any facet of the activist policy agenda . The activists will be identifiable as the small group continuing to shout \u201c Denier ! \u201d The \u201c deniers \u201d will be identifiable as everyone else .\n\u2014 Oren Cass is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute .

And remember, for any specific level of warming, forecasts vary widely on the subsequent environmental and economic implications.\n\nAt least one might assume that reasonable minds could be allowed to differ on the ultimate question of how well society is likely to cope with the effects of climate change \u2014 a political, social, and economic question several degrees removed from anything resembling a scientific consensus. Not so. I addressed these issues in a recent Foreign Affairs essay, in which I called the IPCC \u201cthe gold-standard summary,\u201d cited it repeatedly, and adopted its estimate that temperatures could rise by 3 to 4\u00b0C this century. My essay further embraced the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cSocial Cost of Carbon\u201d analysis and adopted its high-case model for economic cost. But the essay argued that the likely impact of all this was \u201cmanageable\u201d rather than \u201ccatastrophic.\u201d Mann decried it as \u201c#Koch climate denial propaganda.\u201d Eric Holthaus, meteorologist and host of the podcast Our Warm Regards, called it \u201ca master class in modern climate denial.\u201d\n\nThe scope of viewpoints that constitute \u201cdenial\u201d is rapidly expanding to swallow all opposition to favored climate policies. In Scientific American, blogger Peter Dykstra declared \u201cgrudgingly admitting the problem while scrambling to avoid addressing it\u201d to be a form of climate denial. Writing in Rolling Stone, Bill McKibben pathetically attempted to introduce the term \u201cRenewables Denial\u201d (\u201cat least as ugly and insidious as its twin sister, Climate Denial\u201d) to describe skepticism that wind and solar power can meet the world\u2019s energy needs anytime soon.\n\nAt stake are the boundaries of debate in our democratic society, on an issue that the self-appointed enforcers insist is the most important one facing us. The ad hominem \u201cdenier\u201d criticism places arguments and their purveyors beyond the pale, unworthy of response. Appealing to a purported \u201c97 percent consensus\u201d asserts that the question has been scientifically answered and policymakers have no business debating it. Such rhetorical techniques are wildly inappropriate where science is in fact, by its own admission, not settled, and especially where science is but one input to a difficult policy question.\n\nScience is but one input to a difficult policy question.\n\nFortunately, this nonsense is unsustainable. The Times tried letting people speak for themselves, introducing quotes from twelve of Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees with the summary: \u201cMost of the people President-elect Donald J. Trump has chosen for the top tiers of his administration have expressed doubt that climate change is caused by human activity.\u201d But anyone who actually read the quotes discovered that most of them raised no issues with climate science at all.\n\nIn early March, Davenport tried calling Trump appointees \u201cskeptics,\u201d rather than \u201cdeniers.\u201d But Gillis summarized her story, headlined \u201cEPA Head Stacks Agency with Climate Change Skeptics,\u201d in a tweet as \u201cTop posts at EPA are being stocked with climate-change denialists.\u201d He then acknowledged that the conflicting word choices were no accident and that the Times \u201ccannot seem to achieve internal consistency about what word to use, despite best efforts.\u201d That was awkward, though not as awkward as Professor Michael Mann\u2019s testimony before the House Science Committee later that month: \u201cI don\u2019t believe I called anybody here a denier,\u201d he asserted, \u201cyet that\u2019s been stated over and over again. So I\u2019ve been misrepresented quite a bit today.\u201d To which Professor Judith Curry, sitting just to his right, responded, \u201cIt\u2019s in your written testimony.\u201d Sure enough, on page 6, Mann referred to \u201cclimate science denier Judith Curry,\u201d even averring, \u201cI use the term carefully.\u201d\n\nActivists, so eager to bar the gates to the public square and keep their opponents out, have instead locked themselves in. If everyone agrees with the 97 percent consensus, and that consensus does not dictate any particular policy outcome, they have nothing else to say. Perhaps this is for the best. If the extremists from both sides become sufficiently marginalized, a reasoned policy debate might emerge about the real risks of climate change and the cost-effective responses. This would require the media to admit that their \u201cdenier\u201d terminology has lost all meaning and to attend equally to the scientifically unsupported statements from both sides.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt would also require a consistent, scientifically accurate message from the White House. The president should clean up the embarrassing ambiguity and vacuity in his own views. And his administration should make clear that it works from mainstream scientific conclusions. EPA Administrator Pruitt confused matters greatly with comments to CNBC last month that went beyond his testimony about \u201cprecision\u201d and \u201cdebate\u201d and suggested that human activity was not the primary cause of recent warming. Pruitt had no basis for taking that position, nor does he gain anything from it; even Fox News confronted him. Conversely, an accurate statement of the science would only strengthen his position in defending the policies he seeks to implement. The more he focuses discussion on costs and benefits of EPA actions, the more reasonable he will seem \u2014 and the more reasonable he will be.\n\nFor now, though, navigating the climate debate will require translating the phrase \u201cclimate denier\u201d to mean \u201canyone unsympathetic to the most aggressive activists\u2019 claims.\u201d This apparently includes anyone who acknowledges meaningful uncertainty in climate models, adopts a less-than-catastrophic outlook about the consequences of future warming, or opposes any facet of the activist policy agenda. The activists will be identifiable as the small group continuing to shout \u201cDenier!\u201d The \u201cdeniers\u201d will be identifiable as everyone else.\n\n\u2014 Oren Cass is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.
