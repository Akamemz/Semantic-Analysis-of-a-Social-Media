    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) President Donald Trump declared Sunday morning that ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was dead after a US military raid in northwest Syria over the weekend .\nThe President said a US special operations forces mission went after the ISIS leader and there were no US deaths during the operation .\nSeveral ISIS fighters and companions of Baghdadi were killed , including two women wearing suicide vests and three children . Trump would not provide a specific number of casualties , only describing those targeted on scene as `` more dead than alive . '' Eleven children were moved out of the house and are uninjured , the President said .\nThe death of Baghdadi marks the culmination of a years-long hunt to find one of the most wanted terrorists in the world and the man who declared a so-called Islamic caliphate in Iraq and Syria in 2014 . But it also comes as the US military is pulling back in Syria , a move analysts warn could allow for an ISIS resurgence\nBut Trump insisted Baghdadi 's demise had nothing to do with the US 's recent decision to pull out of northern Syria . `` No , the pullout had nothing to do with this . In fact we found this out at a very similar time , '' Trump said . `` No , we 're after these leaders , and we have others in site .

( AP Photo/Ghaith Alsayed )\nTrump said Baghdadi was chased to the end of a dead end tunnel by dogs ,\nbringing three children with him . At the end of the tunnel , he detonated a suicide vest , killing himself and the children with him .\nThe President said `` immediate '' and `` totally positive '' test results proved it was Baghdadi , saying a lab technician on the scene of the raid confirmed the ISIS leader 's death .\n`` He died like a dog . He died like a coward . The world is now a much safer place , '' Trump said .\nTrump described the situation , saying the ISIS leader `` spent his last moments in utter fear , in total panic and dread , terrified of the American forces bearing down on him . ''\nThe President said US forces obtained `` highly sensitive material and information from the raid , much having to do with ISIS \u2014 origins , future plans , things that we very much want . ''\nTrump told reporters Baghdadi was under surveillance for a couple of weeks and that two to three planned missions were scrapped before the successful one was launched .\nThe US flew over certain Russian airspace during the mission , he said .\nThe President said he watched the operation from the White House Situation Room beginning at 5 p.m . The mission , he said , began shortly thereafter and went on for about two hours . He was accompanied by Vice President Mike Pence , National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien , Secretary of Defense Mark Esper , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff U.S. Army General Mark A. Milley , and Brig . Gen. Marcus Evans , Deputy Director for Special Operations , according to Assistant to the President Dan Scavino .\nCIA Director Gina Haspel did play a role in the operation on Saturday , according to a source familiar with the matter . She would have been monitoring from CIA headquarters and in touch with the Situation Room , similar to how then-CIA Director Leon Panetta was positioned during the Osama bin Laden operation .\nActing Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire was not in the Situation Room either , but an ODNI spokesperson said Maguire was `` fully aware and engaged in the planning . For the operation itself , he was out of town due to a pre-arranged engagement but watched with the CENTCOM commander . ''\n`` Last night was a great night for United States and for the world , '' the President said . He described in sometimes brutal terms how al-Baghdadi died .\nHe said the leader , `` spent his last moments in utter fear ... terrified of the American forces bearing down on him . '' He described Baghdadi as , `` crying , whimpering , screaming , and bringing three kids with him . To die . Certain death . ''\nBaghdadi 's body may be disposed at sea , a source familiar with the matter told CNN . O'Brien told NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' Sunday that he expected the US to follow the same protocol as Bin Laden , who was killed in a 2011 raid in Pakistan by US Navy SEALs and was buried at sea .\nBaghdadi 's body , O'Brien said , `` will be disposed of properly . '' When asked if the US would follow the same protocol as Bin Laden , O'Brien said , `` I would expect that to be the case . ''\nThe President said he informed a few members of Congress of the raid ahead of his announcement , including Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham , who sits on the Foreign Relations Committee , and Republican Sen. Richard Burr , who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee . Trump said he did not inform key Democrats , including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer . Trump said a leak of the raid could have cost American lives .\nPelosi 's office confirmed to CNN 's Manu Raju there was no notice given ahead of the raid to it .\n`` This month , the House passed a joint resolution on an overwhelmingly bipartisan 354-60 basis which rejects President Trump 's green-lighting of Turkish aggression into Syria against our Kurdish partners , and calls on him to present a clear strategy to defeat ISIS , '' Pelosi said in a statement issued Sunday . `` The House must be briefed on this raid , which the Russians but not top Congressional Leadership were notified of in advance , and on the Administration 's overall strategy in the region . Our military and allies deserve strong , smart and strategic leadership from Washington . ''\nSchumer said at an unrelated press conference in New York City Sunday that he learned about Baghdadi 's death by seeing it on television .\n`` I did n't know . I saw it on TV , '' Schumer said . When asked for his reaction to the news , Schumer added , `` My reaction ? Look , it 's great that we 've gotten al-Baghdadi and killed him . He 's a dangerous man , an evil man . The fight against ISIS has to continue . ''\nTrump said it was a `` very dangerous mission , '' regarding flying in and flying out . He thanked Russia , Turkey , Syria , Iraq and Syrian Kurds for helping in the mission .\nBut the Russian military on Sunday questioned the official US account of the raid , saying it was not aware of any US military operations in the region .\nDuring the mission , he said , US service members were met with local gunfire , which was eliminated .\nJUST WATCHED Trump announces ISIS leader al-Baghdadi is dead Replay More Videos ...
