    "content": "Conservatives have not owned the GOP for a long time . This election has forced them to see it .\nRepublicans have always un\u00adderstood that their party \u2019 s tent is home to different factions . But they have long tended to perceive these factions\u2014the grassroots base , the business Right , the conservative movement , and the governing-party establishment\u2014as deeply united by a way of thinking , and not just by transactional relationships .\nFor two decades and more after the end of the Reagan era , Republicans implicitly thought of this coalition in terms we might roughly describe as \u201c The Four Modes of Phil Gramm. \u201d Gramm , the former senator from Texas , was an ideal full-spectrum-conservative Republican . He was a homespun populist pouring his common sense like ice-cold water over liberal eggheads . He was a libertarian economics professor who believed in markets because he could do math . He was a wonk-intellectual deeply conversant in the vocabulary of modern conservatism . And he was a prudent politician who could cut a deal . So Gramm could be fully at home among the grassroots activists , the businesspeople , the conservative thinkers , and the politicians , but in every case he was a purist conservative of a particular sort .\nIn their rhetoric , but also in their genuine self-understanding , many Repub\u00adlican activists and elected officials as\u00adsumed that most people in these different factions roughly fit that description , too . This has never been quite true ; it has grown less true over time , and it simply is no longer true in the wake of this momentous election .\nThe most significant implication of the party \u2019 s self-misunderstanding was a misimpression of the nature of its grassroots voters . Republican politicians thought of the base of the party as a steadfastly conservative voting bloc that would rebel against any departures from the GOP \u2019 s longstanding agenda and would be dissatisfied with party leaders to the extent they were not sufficiently aggressive in its pursuit . The war be\u00adtween the Tea Party and the establishment in the Obama years was fought on this premise .\nBut Donald Trump \u2019 s campaign , even before he won the election , demonstrated that this understanding of the Right \u2019 s grassroots\u2014the understanding on which the work of various tea-party activist groups , the House Freedom Caucus , and Senator Ted Cruz \u2019 s presidential campaign , as well as the responses to these from establishment Republicans , were based\u2014was in error in some important ways , and in any case is no longer operative . Trump showed that much of the base of the party was driven far more by resentment of elitist arrogance , by a rejection of globalism , and by economic and cultural insecurity than by a commitment to conservative economic or political principles . And he thereby also made the base of the party even more traditionally populist .\nThis is surely part of the reason why most members of the House Freedom Caucus and many prominent conservative talk-radio hosts didn \u2019 t stand athwart Trump \u2019 s candidacy in the primaries , even though he showed contempt for much of what they have always championed . Trump demonstrated that the people they claimed to represent were not quite who they had imagined they were .\nHe made this explicit soon after clinch\u00ading the nomination . \u201c This is called the Republican party , it \u2019 s not called the Conservative party , \u201d Trump said in an interview in May . It was an extraordinary thing for a Republican presidential contender to say . And it was also true and important , and recognizing it would be a very good thing for both Republicans and conservatives .\nFor conservatives , in particular , ceasing to imagine that we own the Re\u00adpublican coalition , and therefore ceasing to expect it to simply follow our lead , would be a spur to sharpen , strengthen , and modernize our ideas so that they are more attractive and a better fit to contemporary problems . Understanding the need to persuade our fellow Republicans ( and not just business leaders but populist middle- and working-class voters ) that our ideas would address their concerns and priorities would strengthen our ability to persuade others , too . And it would help Republicans reinforce gains built up in a protest election that would be hard to sustain without substantive policy accomplishments .\nBut coalitions shape their members , and so just as conservatives might hope to channel the energies of the populist Right and restrain its excesses , sharing the party with a populist voter base might in turn reshape conservatism . In\u00addeed , in some important ways it has already done that over the past decade and more . And just as Republicans have failed to take note of the actual character of their coalition , conservatives too have not sufficiently acknowledged how our movement has changed .\nJust as Republicans have failed to take note of the actual character of their coalition , conservatives too have not sufficiently acknowledged how our movement has changed .\nAmerican conservatism has always been a collection of varied groups and schools of thought united , in broad terms , by a general view of the world . That view usually involves a low opinion of man \u2019 s character and rationality , combined with a high opinion of his dignity and rights ; a resulting skepticism about power that tends to point toward greater confidence in mediating institutions and decentralized decision-making than in consolidated expertise and social engineering ; and an overarching belief that the world is a dangerous place and maintaining order takes real work . These general views explain the attachment con\u00adservatives have to the American Constitution\u2014which is rooted in some similar premises\u2014and to the Western tradition beyond .\nBut as foundations for a coalition , these general views can add up in different ways under different circumstances . Since the 1970s , conservatives have tended to think of them as adding up to a coalition modeled on a three-legged stool . The legs have been muscular ( originally anti-Communist ) internationalism , social conservatism , and supply-side economics . Different conservatives emphasized these differently , with some really belonging to just one faction and only tolerating the others for practical ends . But the three routinely worked together .\nAnd as happens in coalitions , the three elements all tended to shape one another over time . The internationalists made social conservatives tougher and less na\u00efve about the world , and made the supply-siders more committed to freedom along with wealth . The social conservatives made the hawks more idealistic and made many of the supply-siders pro-life and otherwise traditionalist . The supply-siders made the internationalists smarter critics of Communism and made the social conservatives friendlier to growth and wealth .\nThe result , for a time , was a better-rounded and more effective coalition\u2014one with a particular kind of argument for freedom at its core . And that coalition also helped shape the Republican party in recent decades in its battles with the Democrats , who have been shaped by their own different , if no less powerful , understanding of freedom .\nThat conservative coalition was well formed to offer attractive solutions to the problems of the late 1970s and the 1980s , but with time it has grown in\u00adcreasingly detached from American circumstances and priorities . One of the things we see more clearly in light of this year is that the familiar conservative coalition has for some time already been gradually transforming into a related but different coalition . The precise shape of that emerging coalition remains unclear , but it is a little easier after this momentous election to speculate about its gen\u00aderal outlines .\nRather than muscular internationalism , social conservatism , and supply-side economics , the three legs of the stool of the conservative coalition in the coming years seem more likely to be , broadly speaking , American nationalism , religious communitarianism , and market economics .

The supply-siders are be\u00adlievers in free markets , they just tend to emphasize growth at the margins more than using markets as tools of problem-solving . The social conservatives share the worldview of religious communitarians , if not always the same political instincts . There are many similarities , but this also stands to be a different conservatism in some important ways .\nIt is , for one thing , an ideological coalition that evinces a yearning for solidarity as much as a hunger for freedom .
