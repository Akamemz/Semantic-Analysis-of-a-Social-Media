    "content": "For the past month and a half , the US and much of the world has been consumed by a terrifying question : Is America going to war with Iran ?\nIt \u2019 s an understandable question . The Trump administration says an Iranian strike on Americans in the Middle East remains \u201c imminent \u201d and has blamed Tehran for attacks on oil tankers in a vital waterway . Iran , meanwhile , has told its proxies to prepare for war and indicated it may stop abiding by the 2015 nuclear deal within just a matter of days ( though it hasn \u2019 t said that it plans to pursue a nuclear weapon ) .\nThose developments , combined with the rise of Iran hawks in the administration like National Security Adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , have led to widespread fear that some sort of conflict between Washington and Tehran is imminent .\nHere \u2019 s the good news : Right now it seems fairly unlikely that a full-blown war is on the horizon \u2014 even though a limited strike was considered this week \u2014 mostly because President Donald Trump and American allies don \u2019 t want one . Nor does Iran , it seems .\nBut the situation is still very tense , and the room for error and miscalculation on both sides remains high .\nSo what exactly is going on ? How did we get here ? Why did this escalation happen so suddenly ? And what would a conflict with Iran even look like , anyway ?\nDon \u2019 t worry , we \u2019 ve got you covered . What follows are answers to some of the most pressing questions about the latest US-Iran standoff ; hopefully they \u2019 ll allow you to breathe just a little easier .\nThe current crisis started on May 5 , when National Security Adviser John Bolton announced the US was deploying an aircraft carrier and bomber planes to the Persian Gulf in response to \u201c a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings \u201d of threats from Iran .\nThis move , Bolton said , was meant \u201c to send a clear and unmistakable message to the Iranian regime that any attack on United States interests or on those of our allies will be met with unrelenting force. \u201d He said that the US \u201c is not seeking war with the Iranian regime , \u201d but added , \u201c we are fully prepared to respond to any attack , whether by proxy , the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , or regular Iranian forces . \u201d\nAt the time , it was unclear exactly what that intelligence said , but reports over the following days provided a bit more clarity . Iran apparently intended to target US troops in Iraq and Syria , or even use drones against Americans in a key waterway near Yemen . There was also information that Iran put cruise missiles on ships , heightening fears that it might attack US Navy vessels with them .\nThe severity of the intelligence remains in dispute , and some say Bolton and others have inflated the threat . What isn \u2019 t in dispute is that America \u2019 s response dramatically raised the tension between the two countries \u2014 and a series of subsequent events only made things worse .\nOn May 8 , three days after Bolton \u2019 s statement , Iranian President Hassan Rouhani announced that his country would no longer comply with parts of the 2015 nuclear deal if European signatories to the deal didn \u2019 t provide Iran with financial relief within 60 days .\nSpecifically , Rouhani said Iran would start stockpiling extra low-enriched uranium and heavy water , the kind used in nuclear reactors that could be used to produce a nuclear weapon , and would enrich uranium to previously banned levels .\nAll those actions remain banned by the agreement , which Iran , as well as some European powers , Russia , and China , is still party to . But Tehran \u2019 s decision , which it telegraphed days in advance , came exactly one year after Trump ended the US \u2019 s commitment to the accord .\nRouhani made sure all of that wasn \u2019 t an escalation . \u201c The path we have chosen today is not the path of war , \u201d he said , \u201c it is the path of diplomacy . \u201d\nStill , that set the stage for a potential confrontation : The Trump administration doesn \u2019 t want Iran to get a nuclear weapon , and while Rouhani \u2019 s announcement still wouldn \u2019 t put Tehran anywhere near obtaining the bomb , it inched a little closer . And with the threat of a military fight hanging over it all , the chance for miscalculation grew .\nBut it didn \u2019 t stop there . A few days later , four oil tankers were damaged in attacks near the Strait of Hormuz , a vital waterway aggressively patrolled by Iran through which a third of the world \u2019 s liquefied natural gas and almost 20 percent of the world \u2019 s oil production flows .\nTwo of the oil tankers belonged to Saudi Arabia and one belonged to the United Arab Emirates \u2014 both staunch enemies of Iran and friends to the US . ( The fourth was owned by a Norwegian company . ) United Nations ambassadors from the UAE , Saudi Arabia , and Norway said two weeks ago that the damages came after a country used divers to place mines on the large ships . The diplomats didn \u2019 t specifically name Iran as the culprit , but the US had already blamed Tehran for the sabotage .\nIran denied any involvement . But one day after the suspected attack , Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen launched an assault on a Saudi oil pipeline . And one of Iran \u2019 s top military leaders reportedly told militias in Iraq to prepare for a war , prompting the US to remove some staff from the embassy in Baghdad and its consulate in Erbil last month .\nThen , last week , two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman \u2014 just east of the Strait of Hormuz \u2014 were damaged in suspected attacks . The Trump administration said Iran was responsible .\nThat was followed by an Iranian official on Monday saying his country would stockpile enough low-enriched uranium that it would blow through the limits imposed in the 2015 nuclear deal , the same one the US withdrew from last year . The US soon after responded y saying it would send 1,000 more troops to the Middle East to counter Iran .\nAnd then on Wednesday night or Thursday morning ( the timing is still unclear ) , Iran shot down a US military drone ( no one was hurt ) . That \u2019 s by far the biggest provocation yet in the weeks-long standoff , and could cause the tensions to skyrocket .\nTrump authorized a limited strike on Iran to retaliate for the downing , but suddenly reversed himself , he said on Friday morning , worried that potentially killing Iranians wouldn \u2019 t be a proportionate response .\n.... proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone . I am in no hurry , our Military is rebuilt , new , and ready to go , by far the best in the world . Sanctions are biting & more added last night . Iran can NEVER have Nuclear Weapons , not against the USA , and not against the WORLD ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) June 21 , 2019\nPut together , it \u2019 s a fraught , delicate , and dangerous situation that could spiral out of control if not carefully managed by both countries . Worries of a larger war are widespread , and it \u2019 s not clear how the US and Iran will walk back from the brink .\nThe US and Iran have been at odds for decades . Since a 1979 revolution in Iran that overthrew the American-backed and installed leader , both countries have held aggressive stances toward the other .\nOver the years , Iranian-backed groups have fought and attacked US forces , leaving hundreds of American troops dead in total . The US has also launched assaults of its own , including a devastating cyberattack , a naval campaign to sink Iranian ships , and mistakenly downing an Iranian commercial airliner .\nIn other words , US-Iran relations have always teetered on a knife \u2019 s edge , and it takes just a little push to make an ever-present dilemma much worse . In this case , three recent \u201c pushes \u201d in particular sparked the current standoff .\nFirst , the US withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal last year , reimposing sanctions on the country and compelling European allies to stop importing Iranian oil . That has started to tank Iran \u2019 s economy .\nSecond is how the intelligence and military actions have been perceived over the past few weeks . According to the Wall Street Journal , Iran may have feared an American attack was imminent and is taking action to dissuade the US from doing so .\nThat view would make sense , according to some Iran experts . \u201c To counterattack in response to pressure is a standard part of the Iranian playbook , \u201d Suzanne Maloney , an Iran expert at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington , tweeted on May 6 .\nMisperception and miscalculation are always worrisome in situations like this . One wrong move by the US , for example , could lead Iran to think war is afoot , thereby compelling Tehran to make aggressive countermoves or even launch assaults of its own . The same is true if Tehran startles Washington with some action , leading the White House to authorize a strike .\nWhich takes us to the third \u201c push \u201d : the Iran hawks in the Trump administration who are itching for a fight .\nJohn Bolton , Trump \u2019 s top national security aide , has long argued for regime change in Iran and advocated for bombing the country to stop it from obtaining a nuclear weapon . Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has also pushed the US to confront the Iranian regime .\nIn May 2018 , he gave a speech outlining 12 ways the clerical government must change \u2014 including stopping its support for proxy groups and halting its missile program \u2014 before the US lifts any financial and diplomatic pressure off Tehran .\nTogether , they have made the Trump administration a lot more antagonistic toward the Islamic Republic . It \u2019 s a stark difference from when Trump was flanked by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson . While they both expressed deep distrust of Iran , they didn \u2019 t make maximalist demands or threaten conflict so brazenly .\nIt \u2019 s important to note that Trump says he doesn \u2019 t want a war with Iran , but the problem is that he \u2019 s effectively outsourced his Iran policy to the hawks . That means that at a time when cooler heads should prevail , there aren \u2019 t many cool heads to be found .\n\u201c Moments like these are when institutions should matter : leadership at the cabinet level , a serious policy-making process , intelligence standards , professional ethics . All those have been eroded by the Trump administration , \u201d Maloney tweeted .\n3 ) Wait , why do Bolton and Pompeo hate Iran so much ?\nIt \u2019 s hard to find two more anti-Iran figures in Washington than the national security adviser and the secretary of state .\nLet \u2019 s start with Bolton : The longtime Republican official and operative rarely has found an authoritarian regime he hasn \u2019 t wanted to punish in some way , but Iran seems to hold a special place in his heart .\nIn 2015 , he wrote an op-ed for the New York Times making the case that the US should bomb Iran to keep it from getting a nuclear weapon . \u201c Iran will not negotiate away its nuclear program , \u201d Bolton wrote , slamming the Obama administration \u2019 s efforts to strike a diplomatic agreement with Tehran . \u201c The inconvenient truth is that only military action ... can accomplish what is required . Time is terribly short , but a strike can still succeed . \u201d\nAnd in 2017 , just eight months before becoming Trump \u2019 s third national security adviser , Bolton gave a paid speech to an Iranian exile group that wants to overthrow the country \u2019 s leadership .\nClearly , he agrees with them : \u201c The declared policy of the United States should be the overthrow of the mullahs \u2019 regime in Tehran , \u201d he said . \u201c The behavior and the objectives of the regime are not going to change and , therefore , the only solution is to change the regime itself . \u201d\n\u201c Before 2019 , we here will celebrate in Tehran , \u201d he concluded . Well , it \u2019 s 2019 now , so perhaps Bolton hopes to make up for lost time .\nWhere Bolton \u2019 s animus seems driven by Cold War-era thinking , Pompeo \u2019 s seems to come from something much deeper .\nThe nation \u2019 s chief diplomat has made no secret of his evangelical Christian faith , which he admits guides his policy views . That holds true for world affairs , where his religious beliefs have partly led him to offer unqualified support for Israel , a key American ally \u2014 and for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who sees Iran as an existential threat to his country .\nDuring a March 20 visit to Jerusalem , for example , Pompeo and Netanyahu both vowed to continue their joint pressure on Iran . Five days later , the secretary gave a speech to the pro-Israel lobby group American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) to show his support for the US ally and disdain for Iran .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve enacted the strongest pressure campaign in history against Iran and its proxies , and they are feeling the pain , \u201d Pompeo said to applause . He added : \u201c Anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism , and any nation that espouses anti-Zionism , like Iran , must be confronted . We must defend the rightful homeland of the Jewish people . \u201d\nPompeo , then , has expressly linked America \u2019 s combative stance against Iran to support for Israel . While he has also said Iran deserves pushback for its pursuit of a nuclear program and its support for terrorists and dictators like Bashar al-Assad in Syria , it \u2019 s clear Pompeo views Iran as a threat to a country important to his Christian faith .\nWhich means Bolton and Pompeo are unlikely to tamp down growing tensions with Iran . If anything , they will want to escalate matters now that they have the chance .\nBreathe easy : It doesn \u2019 t look like the US will go to war with Iran anytime soon , although that possibility can \u2019 t be fully counted out . But there are three main reasons for optimism ( or just not outright pessimism ) .\nFirst some experts say the US military deployments to the Middle East aren \u2019 t so out of the ordinary .\nSure , the US moved an anti-missile battery to the region last month , but it removed four of them months earlier , Ilan Goldenberg , an Iran expert at the Center for a New American Security in Washington , tweeted on May 11 . He added that the aircraft carrier sent to the Middle East to deter an Iranian attack was previously scheduled to be in the region .\n\u201c So what is actually happening ? Someone in the administration has decided to dramatically increase the media posture of the US government around these deployments to apply pressure on Iran , \u201d Goldenberg continued . The reason for the exaggeration , though , is not entirely clear .\nSecond , Trump doesn \u2019 t seem to want a war with Iran . He campaigned on not getting the US further involved in wars abroad , particularly in the Middle East . While Trump is no dove on Iran and seems to relish the US-led pressure on it , he \u2019 s not aching for a fight like some around him . He reportedly told his acting Pentagon chief in May that he doesn \u2019 t want to get into a skirmish with Iran right now .\nAnd when Trump was asked on May 16 if the US was going to war Iran , he simply responded : \u201c Hope not . \u201d\nReporter : `` Mr. President , are we going to war with Iran ? ''\nPresident Trump : `` Hope not . '' pic.twitter.com/bdFeWHZr3M \u2014 MSNBC ( @ MSNBC ) May 16 , 2019\nThird , it actually seems like tensions may be fairly low in the grand scheme of things . For example , Pompeo is leaning on European allies to compel Iran to \u201c de-escalate \u201d the tensions , the New York Times reported in May . It \u2019 s unclear if he \u2019 s doing this under Trump \u2019 s orders or if he \u2019 s decided to tamp down his typical hawkish Iran policies for the time being .\nHowever , the recent attacks on oil tankers , Iran \u2019 s statement that it won \u2019 t abide by a crucial part of the nuclear deal , and the downing of the drone means problems might mount in the days ahead .\nIran made a very big mistake ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) June 20 , 2019\nStill , the US-Iran standoff isn \u2019 t quite as dire as it seems and may settle down . That \u2019 s not guaranteed , of course , as there \u2019 s always room for error . But for now , it doesn \u2019 t look like the US and Iran are going to war .\n5 ) If the US did decide to go to war with Iran , what would be the rationale ?\nBased on the Trump administration \u2019 s statements and past US policy , America might choose to go to war for three reasons : 1 ) Iran gets close to obtaining a nuclear weapon , 2 ) the US decides to overthrow the regime , or 3 ) Iran launches a massive attack on Americans requiring an even bigger response in return .\nLet \u2019 s start with the nuclear issue . US policy in this and previous administrations is that Iran should not have a nuclear weapon . That \u2019 s why President Barack Obama signed the Iran nuclear deal \u2014 to delay Tehran \u2019 s path to the bomb . Trump pulled out of the deal for a variety of reasons , but one was that he claimed it made Iran \u2019 s ability to get a nuke more likely , even though most experts disagree .\nAs of today , Iran is still far away from having a reliable nuclear arsenal at its disposal \u2014 and it has never officially said it is even seeking the bomb in the first place . But if it starts to move seriously in that direction , one could imagine folks like Bolton and Netanyahu pushing for a military strike on its nuclear facilities . As a sign of Israel \u2019 s seriousness on this issue , it has reportedly even killed nuclear scientists working for the Iranian regime .\nBut what would that actually accomplish in the long run ? Would we be able to stop Iran from ever getting a bomb if it really wanted to ?\n\u201c We can probably destroy the existing program \u201d with limited strikes , Richard Nephew , an architect of the Iran nuclear deal , told me last month . But \u201c we can not prevent Iran from reconstituting that program . So we would then have to either attack again in the future to deal with a reconstituted nuclear program or acquiesce to Iran having a nuclear weapon . \u201d\nAttacking Iran , he added , could actually compel the country to pursue the bomb in earnest in order to deter more US strikes .\nOkay , so what about starting a war to overthrow the regime ? That \u2019 s even less likely to happen , as it would take a colossal military effort . Right now the administration is reportedly considering sending 6,000 more troops to the gulf region , far below what would be required to carry out a major war against Iran .\nThat \u2019 s a far cry from previous considerations . In May administration weighed one plan which included sending 120,000 US troops to the Middle East \u2014 a plan Trump denied was ever in the works . Colin Kahl , who oversaw the Pentagon \u2019 s Iran planning from 2009 to 2011 , tweeted on May 13 that the US would only deploy that many service members if regime change was the goal , although he noted it \u2019 s still too small of a force for a full-scale invasion .\nBy comparison , the US sent around 150,000 troops in the initial phase of the 2003 invasion of Iraq \u2014 and Iran is a much bigger country than Iraq .\nIf the White House aims to remove Iran \u2019 s leadership permanently , then , it would need to launch an invasion on a scale even bigger than the one in Iraq \u2014 starting what would be one of the most horrific wars in recent memory and leading to hundreds of thousands dead .\nIt \u2019 s hard to imagine Trump would find much love for a full-scale war . \u201c Almost nobody would support an Iraq-like ground invasion for regime change under current circumstances , \u201d Eric Brewer , who worked on Iran in Trump \u2019 s National Security Council , told me last month . \u201c It \u2019 s hard to over-emphasize how costly such a conflict would be . \u201d\nFinally , war could break out if Iran were to attack American forces . Iran \u2019 s military leadership does have its troops and proxies on high alert , but that doesn \u2019 t mean Tehran plans to imminently attack Americans .\nThe Islamic Republic is almost certainly aware that any action that puts US troops , diplomats , or private citizens in mortal danger will provide Trump advisers like Bolton or Pompeo with the ammunition needed to push harder for war .\nThe pressure will also be on Trump to respond in kind \u2014 if not more forcefully \u2014 if Iran kills Americans during this tense time . That pressure actually already exists , with some saying the attacks on two oil tankers last week requires a US military response .\nNEW : @ SenTomCotton says , \u201c unprovoked attacks on commercial shipping warrant a retaliatory military strike against the Islamic Republic of Iran. \u201d pic.twitter.com/tNacjTY7xv \u2014 Face The Nation ( @ FaceTheNation ) June 16 , 2019\nThat therefore incentivizes Tehran not to make overly provocative moves right now .\nLuckily , then , none of these main pathways to war seem particularly open . And while it \u2019 s unlikely they will be , that \u2019 s not a certainty either .\nThat really comes down to what the US wants to accomplish , experts say . As noted above , war could take the form of targeted US military strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities , or it could look like a full-scale invasion of Iran by the US .\nBut it \u2019 s worth noting that there are lower-level ways the US and Iran could fight each other .\nFor example , the US could launch cyberattacks on Iran \u2019 s infrastructure and power grid , a plan the military has already named \u201c Nitro Zeus. \u201d The Obama administration used this method to bring down part of Iran \u2019 s nuclear program . However , Iran has cyber capabilities of its own that it could use to target important American companies or even the government .\nWhat \u2019 s more , Iran \u2019 s proxies across the Middle East could target Americans in Iraq , Syria , or elsewhere in the Middle East . Perhaps worried about that possibility , the US removed staff from two of its missions in Iraq last month .\nImportantly , Iran doesn \u2019 t have nuclear weapons , so the worst attack imaginable is off the table . Still , it \u2019 s possible that Tehran could use its growing missile program to target American ships and troops in the area .\nIt therefore wouldn \u2019 t take a full-on fight for things to get really , really bad between the US and Iran pretty quickly . Let \u2019 s hope we don \u2019 t find out .\n7 ) Does anyone outside the US want an Iran war ?\nMainly no , but there are some out there who do .\nIsrael , which in the past has advocated for strikes on Iran , is actively trying to stay out of the fray . The main reason is that a major war with Tehran would certainly involve Israel , most likely pitting it against Hezbollah , Iran \u2019 s ally and proxy in Lebanon .\nAxios reported in May that Netanyahu has told his top defense and intelligence leadership that his country should \u201c make every effort not to get dragged into the escalation in the Gulf and would not interfere directly in the situation. \u201d So Israel , along with the United Arab Emirates , has backed off its openly hawkish Iran stances so as not to spark a war right now .\nRussia and European countries , especially those still party to the Iran nuclear deal , are also working as go-betweens to end the standoff . Experts also say that European nations worry greatly about millions of refugees streaming into the continent if a war with Iran breaks out , which would put immense pressure on governments already dealing with the fallout of the Syrian refugee crisis .\nThat \u2019 s bad news for Bolton and others who might want a full-on war with Iran . For the US to be successful , it will need political and military support from Israel and Europeans . Without them , the US would struggle to have the international legitimacy and help it needs not only to win the fight but also to deal with the immense fallout .\nBut the US does have some support for a fight . Most of it comes from Saudi Arabia , which has been locked in a decades-long cold war of sorts with Iran for control in the Middle East . Arab News , a Riyadh-aligned newspaper , called for the US to launch a \u201c surgical strike \u201d on Iran in May .\nThat said , Riyadh doesn \u2019 t seem to want a war right now . Saudi Foreign Affairs Minister Adel al-Jubeir told reporters last month that \u201c the kingdom of Saudi Arabia does not want war in the region and does not strive for that. \u201d He added : \u201c if the other side chooses war , the kingdom will fight this with all force and determination and it will defend itself , its citizens and its interests . \u201d\nStill , it seems that if the US decided to launch a war with Iran , it would mostly do so alone . That must surely give even those itching for a fight in the Trump administration some pause .\n8 ) This feels like the runup to the Iraq War . Is it similar ?\nNot really , no . \u201c There are valid concerns that some in the administration are casting intelligence in a certain light to further their goals of regime change , but I think there are more differences than similarities to Iraq , \u201d says Brewer , who is now at the Center for a New American Security in Washington .\nIn the runup to the Iraq War , George W. Bush \u2019 s administration made a clear and repeated case that Saddam Hussein , the country \u2019 s brutal dictator , had weapons of mass destruction . The problem is that it was based on cherry-picked intelligence that proved not to be credible , leading the US to launch a war based on faulty information and a misleading public pitch .\n\u201c There was a serious , coordinated effort by the Bush administration \u2014 via major speeches , interviews , etc . \u2014 to lay out its case for war . None of that appears to be happening now , \u201d Brewer told me .\nStill , there \u2019 s a good reason some compare the current Iran moment to the previous Iraq one . You have a Republican administration , featuring some of the same figures who pushed the US to war in Iraq ( namely , Bolton ) , saying it has intelligence showing an imminent threat against Americans .\nSo let \u2019 s be clear about what we actually know \u2014 that is , what reports say the US has found :\nIran had plans to target US troops in Iraq and Syria , and a top Iranian military leader told the nation \u2019 s proxies to prepare for war .\nIran has placed missiles on ships that it could use to attack the US Navy , and could use drones against Americans in a key waterway near Yemen .\nThe US military released video the US claims shows Iranians removing an unexploded limpet mine from the side of one of the oil tankers attacked last week .\nExperts are mostly unanimous in believing that intelligence like this exists and is credible . Where they differ is on just how much it clearly shows a new level of Iranian aggression .\nPhillip Smyth , an Iran expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , told me in May that major threats from Tehran \u2019 s proxies have continued since early 2018 . \u201c There have been maneuvers in the past that sent a signal to the Americans \u201d of a worsening regional situation , he said .\nBut he noted that just because there are indications that an attack could happen doesn \u2019 t mean an Iranian proxy will launch one soon . \u201c These guys are very smart and very patient with how they plan and execute , \u201d he said .\nOthers , like Brookings \u2019 s Maloney , have said that people shouldn \u2019 t assume the intelligence is bogus , mainly because Iran would likely retaliate forcefully to the Trump administration \u2019 s antagonism .\nWhat gives many pause , though , is that there seems to be a difference in what the US and its allies glean from the intelligence . For example , a top British military official involved in the coalition fight against ISIS in Iraq told Pentagon reporters last month that the threats weren \u2019 t extraordinary .\nMeanwhile , senators from both parties in Congress have been briefed on the Iran intelligence \u2014 and both came away with completely different reads .\nAfter a May briefing with National Security Adviser John Bolton on Monday , administration ally Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R-SC ) tweeted , \u201c It is clear that over the last several weeks Iran has attacked pipelines and ships of other nations and created threat streams against American interests in Iraq . ... If the Iranian threats against American personnel and interests are activated we must deliver an overwhelming military response . \u201d\nMeanwhile Sen. Chris Murphy ( D-CT ) , an outspoken critic of Trump \u2019 s foreign policy and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , also tweeted his take . \u201c I \u2018 m listening to Republicans twist the Iran intel to make it sound like Iran is taking unprovoked , offensive measures against the US and our allies . Like it just came out of nowhere , \u201d he said . \u201c I \u2019 ve read the intel too . And let me be clear : That \u2019 s not what the intel says . \u201d\nUS defense and intelligence officials familiar with the information wouldn \u2019 t provide me with any more information than is already public .\nBut what makes all this different from the Iraq War is that both Congress and the press are refusing to take the administration \u2019 s claims at face value , and instead are pushing the Trump administration to back up those claims with actual proof .\n9 ) Does the US-Iran standoff have anything to do with oil ?\nPretty much anytime talk of America going to war in the Middle East comes up , people wonder if it \u2019 s merely a quest to control more oil . That \u2019 s fair to an extent , as the US and other world powers have launched wars to take charge of energy sources .\nThat \u2019 s not really the case here . What the US does care about , though , is ensuring that vessels are allowed to sail freely through the Strait of Hormuz , a crucial maritime passage aggressively patrolled by Iran where a third of the world \u2019 s liquefied natural gas and almost 20 percent of the world \u2019 s oil production flows . When US-Iran tensions spike , Iran typically threatens to shut down the strait .\nDoing so would send the global energy market into a tailspin and cause a worldwide crisis .\nBut Iran doesn \u2019 t usually follow through with its bluster , surely aware of the fury it would face from the United States and others . So when news of the mystery attacks on oil tankers surfaced twice in two months , it raised worries that Tehran may have found a way to send a message .\n\u201c By signaling that this supply is not safe and can be disrupted , Tehran is letting the world know it has escalation options , \u201d Behnam Ben Taleblu , an Iran expert at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies , told me last month .\nBut while the continued supply of cheap oil is definitely important to the US , it \u2019 s not really the reason some in the Trump administration are pushing for an Iran fight today . That really comes down to this : Bolton , Pompeo , and others want regime change in Iran , and are using intelligence that shows Tehran doing provocative things to advocate for a more combative stance .\nBut Trump is still the boss , and so far he \u2019 s expressed no real appetite for war with Iran . Which means that a major , bloody conflict remains an unlikely possibility \u2014 at least for now .\nOn this episode of \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Worldly podcast , Zack Beauchamp and Alex Ward break down the past few weeks of worrying news about Iran .",
    "content_original": "For the past month and a half, the US and much of the world has been consumed by a terrifying question: Is America going to war with Iran?\n\nIt\u2019s an understandable question. The Trump administration says an Iranian strike on Americans in the Middle East remains \u201cimminent\u201d and has blamed Tehran for attacks on oil tankers in a vital waterway. Iran, meanwhile, has told its proxies to prepare for war and indicated it may stop abiding by the 2015 nuclear deal within just a matter of days (though it hasn\u2019t said that it plans to pursue a nuclear weapon).\n\nThose developments, combined with the rise of Iran hawks in the administration like National Security Adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have led to widespread fear that some sort of conflict between Washington and Tehran is imminent.\n\nHere\u2019s the good news: Right now it seems fairly unlikely that a full-blown war is on the horizon \u2014 even though a limited strike was considered this week \u2014 mostly because President Donald Trump and American allies don\u2019t want one. Nor does Iran, it seems.\n\nBut the situation is still very tense, and the room for error and miscalculation on both sides remains high.\n\nSo what exactly is going on? How did we get here? Why did this escalation happen so suddenly? And what would a conflict with Iran even look like, anyway?\n\nDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve got you covered. What follows are answers to some of the most pressing questions about the latest US-Iran standoff; hopefully they\u2019ll allow you to breathe just a little easier.\n\n1) What is actually going on?\n\nThe current crisis started on May 5, when National Security Adviser John Bolton announced the US was deploying an aircraft carrier and bomber planes to the Persian Gulf in response to \u201ca number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings\u201d of threats from Iran.\n\nThis move, Bolton said, was meant \u201cto send a clear and unmistakable message to the Iranian regime that any attack on United States interests or on those of our allies will be met with unrelenting force.\u201d He said that the US \u201cis not seeking war with the Iranian regime,\u201d but added, \u201cwe are fully prepared to respond to any attack, whether by proxy, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or regular Iranian forces.\u201d\n\nAt the time, it was unclear exactly what that intelligence said, but reports over the following days provided a bit more clarity. Iran apparently intended to target US troops in Iraq and Syria, or even use drones against Americans in a key waterway near Yemen. There was also information that Iran put cruise missiles on ships, heightening fears that it might attack US Navy vessels with them.\n\nThe severity of the intelligence remains in dispute, and some say Bolton and others have inflated the threat. What isn\u2019t in dispute is that America\u2019s response dramatically raised the tension between the two countries \u2014 and a series of subsequent events only made things worse.\n\nOn May 8, three days after Bolton\u2019s statement, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani announced that his country would no longer comply with parts of the 2015 nuclear deal if European signatories to the deal didn\u2019t provide Iran with financial relief within 60 days.\n\nSpecifically, Rouhani said Iran would start stockpiling extra low-enriched uranium and heavy water, the kind used in nuclear reactors that could be used to produce a nuclear weapon, and would enrich uranium to previously banned levels.\n\nAll those actions remain banned by the agreement, which Iran, as well as some European powers, Russia, and China, is still party to. But Tehran\u2019s decision, which it telegraphed days in advance, came exactly one year after Trump ended the US\u2019s commitment to the accord.\n\nRouhani made sure all of that wasn\u2019t an escalation. \u201cThe path we have chosen today is not the path of war,\u201d he said, \u201cit is the path of diplomacy.\u201d\n\nStill, that set the stage for a potential confrontation: The Trump administration doesn\u2019t want Iran to get a nuclear weapon, and while Rouhani\u2019s announcement still wouldn\u2019t put Tehran anywhere near obtaining the bomb, it inched a little closer. And with the threat of a military fight hanging over it all, the chance for miscalculation grew.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t stop there. A few days later, four oil tankers were damaged in attacks near the Strait of Hormuz, a vital waterway aggressively patrolled by Iran through which a third of the world\u2019s liquefied natural gas and almost 20 percent of the world\u2019s oil production flows.\n\nTwo of the oil tankers belonged to Saudi Arabia and one belonged to the United Arab Emirates \u2014 both staunch enemies of Iran and friends to the US. (The fourth was owned by a Norwegian company.) United Nations ambassadors from the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Norway said two weeks ago that the damages came after a country used divers to place mines on the large ships. The diplomats didn\u2019t specifically name Iran as the culprit, but the US had already blamed Tehran for the sabotage.\n\nIran denied any involvement. But one day after the suspected attack, Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen launched an assault on a Saudi oil pipeline. And one of Iran\u2019s top military leaders reportedly told militias in Iraq to prepare for a war, prompting the US to remove some staff from the embassy in Baghdad and its consulate in Erbil last month.\n\nThen, last week, two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman \u2014 just east of the Strait of Hormuz \u2014 were damaged in suspected attacks. The Trump administration said Iran was responsible.\n\nThat was followed by an Iranian official on Monday saying his country would stockpile enough low-enriched uranium that it would blow through the limits imposed in the 2015 nuclear deal, the same one the US withdrew from last year. The US soon after responded y saying it would send 1,000 more troops to the Middle East to counter Iran.\n\nAnd then on Wednesday night or Thursday morning (the timing is still unclear), Iran shot down a US military drone (no one was hurt). That\u2019s by far the biggest provocation yet in the weeks-long standoff, and could cause the tensions to skyrocket.\n\nTrump authorized a limited strike on Iran to retaliate for the downing, but suddenly reversed himself, he said on Friday morning, worried that potentially killing Iranians wouldn\u2019t be a proportionate response.\n\n....proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone. I am in no hurry, our Military is rebuilt, new, and ready to go, by far the best in the world. Sanctions are biting & more added last night. Iran can NEVER have Nuclear Weapons, not against the USA, and not against the WORLD! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 21, 2019\n\nPut together, it\u2019s a fraught, delicate, and dangerous situation that could spiral out of control if not carefully managed by both countries. Worries of a larger war are widespread, and it\u2019s not clear how the US and Iran will walk back from the brink.\n\n2) Why is all of this happening right now?\n\nThe US and Iran have been at odds for decades. Since a 1979 revolution in Iran that overthrew the American-backed and installed leader, both countries have held aggressive stances toward the other.\n\nOver the years, Iranian-backed groups have fought and attacked US forces, leaving hundreds of American troops dead in total. The US has also launched assaults of its own, including a devastating cyberattack, a naval campaign to sink Iranian ships, and mistakenly downing an Iranian commercial airliner.\n\nIn other words, US-Iran relations have always teetered on a knife\u2019s edge, and it takes just a little push to make an ever-present dilemma much worse. In this case, three recent \u201cpushes\u201d in particular sparked the current standoff.\n\nFirst, the US withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal last year, reimposing sanctions on the country and compelling European allies to stop importing Iranian oil. That has started to tank Iran\u2019s economy.\n\nSecond is how the intelligence and military actions have been perceived over the past few weeks. According to the Wall Street Journal, Iran may have feared an American attack was imminent and is taking action to dissuade the US from doing so.\n\nThat view would make sense, according to some Iran experts. \u201cTo counterattack in response to pressure is a standard part of the Iranian playbook,\u201d Suzanne Maloney, an Iran expert at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington, tweeted on May 6.\n\nMisperception and miscalculation are always worrisome in situations like this. One wrong move by the US, for example, could lead Iran to think war is afoot, thereby compelling Tehran to make aggressive countermoves or even launch assaults of its own. The same is true if Tehran startles Washington with some action, leading the White House to authorize a strike.\n\nWhich takes us to the third \u201cpush\u201d: the Iran hawks in the Trump administration who are itching for a fight.\n\nJohn Bolton, Trump\u2019s top national security aide, has long argued for regime change in Iran and advocated for bombing the country to stop it from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has also pushed the US to confront the Iranian regime.\n\nIn May 2018, he gave a speech outlining 12 ways the clerical government must change \u2014 including stopping its support for proxy groups and halting its missile program \u2014 before the US lifts any financial and diplomatic pressure off Tehran.\n\nTogether, they have made the Trump administration a lot more antagonistic toward the Islamic Republic. It\u2019s a stark difference from when Trump was flanked by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. While they both expressed deep distrust of Iran, they didn\u2019t make maximalist demands or threaten conflict so brazenly.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Trump says he doesn\u2019t want a war with Iran, but the problem is that he\u2019s effectively outsourced his Iran policy to the hawks. That means that at a time when cooler heads should prevail, there aren\u2019t many cool heads to be found.\n\n\u201cMoments like these are when institutions should matter: leadership at the cabinet level, a serious policy-making process, intelligence standards, professional ethics. All those have been eroded by the Trump administration,\u201d Maloney tweeted.\n\n3) Wait, why do Bolton and Pompeo hate Iran so much?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to find two more anti-Iran figures in Washington than the national security adviser and the secretary of state.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Bolton: The longtime Republican official and operative rarely has found an authoritarian regime he hasn\u2019t wanted to punish in some way, but Iran seems to hold a special place in his heart.\n\nIn 2015, he wrote an op-ed for the New York Times making the case that the US should bomb Iran to keep it from getting a nuclear weapon. \u201cIran will not negotiate away its nuclear program,\u201d Bolton wrote, slamming the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to strike a diplomatic agreement with Tehran. \u201cThe inconvenient truth is that only military action ... can accomplish what is required. Time is terribly short, but a strike can still succeed.\u201d\n\nAnd in 2017, just eight months before becoming Trump\u2019s third national security adviser, Bolton gave a paid speech to an Iranian exile group that wants to overthrow the country\u2019s leadership.\n\nClearly, he agrees with them: \u201cThe declared policy of the United States should be the overthrow of the mullahs\u2019 regime in Tehran,\u201d he said. \u201cThe behavior and the objectives of the regime are not going to change and, therefore, the only solution is to change the regime itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore 2019, we here will celebrate in Tehran,\u201d he concluded. Well, it\u2019s 2019 now, so perhaps Bolton hopes to make up for lost time.\n\nWhere Bolton\u2019s animus seems driven by Cold War-era thinking, Pompeo\u2019s seems to come from something much deeper.\n\nThe nation\u2019s chief diplomat has made no secret of his evangelical Christian faith, which he admits guides his policy views. That holds true for world affairs, where his religious beliefs have partly led him to offer unqualified support for Israel, a key American ally \u2014 and for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who sees Iran as an existential threat to his country.\n\nDuring a March 20 visit to Jerusalem, for example, Pompeo and Netanyahu both vowed to continue their joint pressure on Iran. Five days later, the secretary gave a speech to the pro-Israel lobby group American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) to show his support for the US ally and disdain for Iran.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve enacted the strongest pressure campaign in history against Iran and its proxies, and they are feeling the pain,\u201d Pompeo said to applause. He added: \u201cAnti-Zionism is anti-Semitism, and any nation that espouses anti-Zionism, like Iran, must be confronted. We must defend the rightful homeland of the Jewish people.\u201d\n\nPompeo, then, has expressly linked America\u2019s combative stance against Iran to support for Israel. While he has also said Iran deserves pushback for its pursuit of a nuclear program and its support for terrorists and dictators like Bashar al-Assad in Syria, it\u2019s clear Pompeo views Iran as a threat to a country important to his Christian faith.\n\nWhich means Bolton and Pompeo are unlikely to tamp down growing tensions with Iran. If anything, they will want to escalate matters now that they have the chance.\n\n4) Are the US and Iran going to war?\n\nBreathe easy: It doesn\u2019t look like the US will go to war with Iran anytime soon, although that possibility can\u2019t be fully counted out. But there are three main reasons for optimism (or just not outright pessimism).\n\nFirst some experts say the US military deployments to the Middle East aren\u2019t so out of the ordinary.\n\nSure, the US moved an anti-missile battery to the region last month, but it removed four of them months earlier, Ilan Goldenberg, an Iran expert at the Center for a New American Security in Washington, tweeted on May 11. He added that the aircraft carrier sent to the Middle East to deter an Iranian attack was previously scheduled to be in the region.\n\n\u201cSo what is actually happening? Someone in the administration has decided to dramatically increase the media posture of the US government around these deployments to apply pressure on Iran,\u201d Goldenberg continued. The reason for the exaggeration, though, is not entirely clear.\n\nSecond, Trump doesn\u2019t seem to want a war with Iran. He campaigned on not getting the US further involved in wars abroad, particularly in the Middle East. While Trump is no dove on Iran and seems to relish the US-led pressure on it, he\u2019s not aching for a fight like some around him. He reportedly told his acting Pentagon chief in May that he doesn\u2019t want to get into a skirmish with Iran right now.\n\nAnd when Trump was asked on May 16 if the US was going to war Iran, he simply responded: \u201cHope not.\u201d\n\nReporter: \"Mr. President, are we going to war with Iran?\"\n\n\n\nPresident Trump: \"Hope not.\" pic.twitter.com/bdFeWHZr3M \u2014 MSNBC (@MSNBC) May 16, 2019\n\nThird, it actually seems like tensions may be fairly low in the grand scheme of things. For example, Pompeo is leaning on European allies to compel Iran to \u201cde-escalate\u201d the tensions, the New York Times reported in May. It\u2019s unclear if he\u2019s doing this under Trump\u2019s orders or if he\u2019s decided to tamp down his typical hawkish Iran policies for the time being.\n\nHowever, the recent attacks on oil tankers, Iran\u2019s statement that it won\u2019t abide by a crucial part of the nuclear deal, and the downing of the drone means problems might mount in the days ahead.\n\nIran made a very big mistake! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 20, 2019\n\nStill, the US-Iran standoff isn\u2019t quite as dire as it seems and may settle down. That\u2019s not guaranteed, of course, as there\u2019s always room for error. But for now, it doesn\u2019t look like the US and Iran are going to war.\n\n5) If the US did decide to go to war with Iran, what would be the rationale?\n\nBased on the Trump administration\u2019s statements and past US policy, America might choose to go to war for three reasons: 1) Iran gets close to obtaining a nuclear weapon, 2) the US decides to overthrow the regime, or 3) Iran launches a massive attack on Americans requiring an even bigger response in return.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the nuclear issue. US policy in this and previous administrations is that Iran should not have a nuclear weapon. That\u2019s why President Barack Obama signed the Iran nuclear deal \u2014 to delay Tehran\u2019s path to the bomb. Trump pulled out of the deal for a variety of reasons, but one was that he claimed it made Iran\u2019s ability to get a nuke more likely, even though most experts disagree.\n\nAs of today, Iran is still far away from having a reliable nuclear arsenal at its disposal \u2014 and it has never officially said it is even seeking the bomb in the first place. But if it starts to move seriously in that direction, one could imagine folks like Bolton and Netanyahu pushing for a military strike on its nuclear facilities. As a sign of Israel\u2019s seriousness on this issue, it has reportedly even killed nuclear scientists working for the Iranian regime.\n\nBut what would that actually accomplish in the long run? Would we be able to stop Iran from ever getting a bomb if it really wanted to?\n\n\u201cWe can probably destroy the existing program\u201d with limited strikes, Richard Nephew, an architect of the Iran nuclear deal, told me last month. But \u201cwe cannot prevent Iran from reconstituting that program. So we would then have to either attack again in the future to deal with a reconstituted nuclear program or acquiesce to Iran having a nuclear weapon.\u201d\n\nAttacking Iran, he added, could actually compel the country to pursue the bomb in earnest in order to deter more US strikes.\n\nOkay, so what about starting a war to overthrow the regime? That\u2019s even less likely to happen, as it would take a colossal military effort. Right now the administration is reportedly considering sending 6,000 more troops to the gulf region, far below what would be required to carry out a major war against Iran.\n\nThat\u2019s a far cry from previous considerations. In May administration weighed one plan which included sending 120,000 US troops to the Middle East \u2014 a plan Trump denied was ever in the works. Colin Kahl, who oversaw the Pentagon\u2019s Iran planning from 2009 to 2011, tweeted on May 13 that the US would only deploy that many service members if regime change was the goal, although he noted it\u2019s still too small of a force for a full-scale invasion.\n\nBy comparison, the US sent around 150,000 troops in the initial phase of the 2003 invasion of Iraq \u2014 and Iran is a much bigger country than Iraq.\n\nIf the White House aims to remove Iran\u2019s leadership permanently, then, it would need to launch an invasion on a scale even bigger than the one in Iraq \u2014 starting what would be one of the most horrific wars in recent memory and leading to hundreds of thousands dead.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine Trump would find much love for a full-scale war. \u201cAlmost nobody would support an Iraq-like ground invasion for regime change under current circumstances,\u201d Eric Brewer, who worked on Iran in Trump\u2019s National Security Council, told me last month. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to over-emphasize how costly such a conflict would be.\u201d\n\nFinally, war could break out if Iran were to attack American forces. Iran\u2019s military leadership does have its troops and proxies on high alert, but that doesn\u2019t mean Tehran plans to imminently attack Americans.\n\nThe Islamic Republic is almost certainly aware that any action that puts US troops, diplomats, or private citizens in mortal danger will provide Trump advisers like Bolton or Pompeo with the ammunition needed to push harder for war.\n\nThe pressure will also be on Trump to respond in kind \u2014 if not more forcefully \u2014 if Iran kills Americans during this tense time. That pressure actually already exists, with some saying the attacks on two oil tankers last week requires a US military response.\n\nNEW: @SenTomCotton says, \u201cunprovoked attacks on commercial shipping warrant a retaliatory military strike against the Islamic Republic of Iran.\u201d pic.twitter.com/tNacjTY7xv \u2014 Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) June 16, 2019\n\nThat therefore incentivizes Tehran not to make overly provocative moves right now.\n\nLuckily, then, none of these main pathways to war seem particularly open. And while it\u2019s unlikely they will be, that\u2019s not a certainty either.\n\n6) What would a war with Iran look like?\n\nThat really comes down to what the US wants to accomplish, experts say. As noted above, war could take the form of targeted US military strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities, or it could look like a full-scale invasion of Iran by the US.\n\nBut it\u2019s worth noting that there are lower-level ways the US and Iran could fight each other.\n\nFor example, the US could launch cyberattacks on Iran\u2019s infrastructure and power grid, a plan the military has already named \u201cNitro Zeus.\u201d The Obama administration used this method to bring down part of Iran\u2019s nuclear program. However, Iran has cyber capabilities of its own that it could use to target important American companies or even the government.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Iran\u2019s proxies across the Middle East could target Americans in Iraq, Syria, or elsewhere in the Middle East. Perhaps worried about that possibility, the US removed staff from two of its missions in Iraq last month.\n\nImportantly, Iran doesn\u2019t have nuclear weapons, so the worst attack imaginable is off the table. Still, it\u2019s possible that Tehran could use its growing missile program to target American ships and troops in the area.\n\nIt therefore wouldn\u2019t take a full-on fight for things to get really, really bad between the US and Iran pretty quickly. Let\u2019s hope we don\u2019t find out.\n\n7) Does anyone outside the US want an Iran war?\n\nMainly no, but there are some out there who do.\n\nIsrael, which in the past has advocated for strikes on Iran, is actively trying to stay out of the fray. The main reason is that a major war with Tehran would certainly involve Israel, most likely pitting it against Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s ally and proxy in Lebanon.\n\nAxios reported in May that Netanyahu has told his top defense and intelligence leadership that his country should \u201cmake every effort not to get dragged into the escalation in the Gulf and would not interfere directly in the situation.\u201d So Israel, along with the United Arab Emirates, has backed off its openly hawkish Iran stances so as not to spark a war right now.\n\nRussia and European countries, especially those still party to the Iran nuclear deal, are also working as go-betweens to end the standoff. Experts also say that European nations worry greatly about millions of refugees streaming into the continent if a war with Iran breaks out, which would put immense pressure on governments already dealing with the fallout of the Syrian refugee crisis.\n\nThat\u2019s bad news for Bolton and others who might want a full-on war with Iran. For the US to be successful, it will need political and military support from Israel and Europeans. Without them, the US would struggle to have the international legitimacy and help it needs not only to win the fight but also to deal with the immense fallout.\n\nBut the US does have some support for a fight. Most of it comes from Saudi Arabia, which has been locked in a decades-long cold war of sorts with Iran for control in the Middle East. Arab News, a Riyadh-aligned newspaper, called for the US to launch a \u201csurgical strike\u201d on Iran in May.\n\nThat said, Riyadh doesn\u2019t seem to want a war right now. Saudi Foreign Affairs Minister Adel al-Jubeir told reporters last month that \u201cthe kingdom of Saudi Arabia does not want war in the region and does not strive for that.\u201d He added: \u201cif the other side chooses war, the kingdom will fight this with all force and determination and it will defend itself, its citizens and its interests.\u201d\n\nStill, it seems that if the US decided to launch a war with Iran, it would mostly do so alone. That must surely give even those itching for a fight in the Trump administration some pause.\n\n8) This feels like the runup to the Iraq War. Is it similar?\n\nNot really, no. \u201cThere are valid concerns that some in the administration are casting intelligence in a certain light to further their goals of regime change, but I think there are more differences than similarities to Iraq,\u201d says Brewer, who is now at the Center for a New American Security in Washington.\n\nIn the runup to the Iraq War, George W. Bush\u2019s administration made a clear and repeated case that Saddam Hussein, the country\u2019s brutal dictator, had weapons of mass destruction. The problem is that it was based on cherry-picked intelligence that proved not to be credible, leading the US to launch a war based on faulty information and a misleading public pitch.\n\n\u201cThere was a serious, coordinated effort by the Bush administration \u2014 via major speeches, interviews, etc. \u2014 to lay out its case for war. None of that appears to be happening now,\u201d Brewer told me.\n\nStill, there\u2019s a good reason some compare the current Iran moment to the previous Iraq one. You have a Republican administration, featuring some of the same figures who pushed the US to war in Iraq (namely, Bolton), saying it has intelligence showing an imminent threat against Americans.\n\nSo let\u2019s be clear about what we actually know \u2014 that is, what reports say the US has found:\n\nIran had plans to target US troops in Iraq and Syria, and a top Iranian military leader told the nation\u2019s proxies to prepare for war.\n\nIran has placed missiles on ships that it could use to attack the US Navy, and could use drones against Americans in a key waterway near Yemen.\n\nThe US military released video the US claims shows Iranians removing an unexploded limpet mine from the side of one of the oil tankers attacked last week.\n\nExperts are mostly unanimous in believing that intelligence like this exists and is credible. Where they differ is on just how much it clearly shows a new level of Iranian aggression.\n\nPhillip Smyth, an Iran expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told me in May that major threats from Tehran\u2019s proxies have continued since early 2018. \u201cThere have been maneuvers in the past that sent a signal to the Americans\u201d of a worsening regional situation, he said.\n\nBut he noted that just because there are indications that an attack could happen doesn\u2019t mean an Iranian proxy will launch one soon. \u201cThese guys are very smart and very patient with how they plan and execute,\u201d he said.\n\nOthers, like Brookings\u2019s Maloney, have said that people shouldn\u2019t assume the intelligence is bogus, mainly because Iran would likely retaliate forcefully to the Trump administration\u2019s antagonism.\n\nWhat gives many pause, though, is that there seems to be a difference in what the US and its allies glean from the intelligence. For example, a top British military official involved in the coalition fight against ISIS in Iraq told Pentagon reporters last month that the threats weren\u2019t extraordinary.\n\nMeanwhile, senators from both parties in Congress have been briefed on the Iran intelligence \u2014 and both came away with completely different reads.\n\nAfter a May briefing with National Security Adviser John Bolton on Monday, administration ally Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) tweeted, \u201cIt is clear that over the last several weeks Iran has attacked pipelines and ships of other nations and created threat streams against American interests in Iraq. ... If the Iranian threats against American personnel and interests are activated we must deliver an overwhelming military response.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT), an outspoken critic of Trump\u2019s foreign policy and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also tweeted his take. \u201cI\u2018m listening to Republicans twist the Iran intel to make it sound like Iran is taking unprovoked, offensive measures against the US and our allies. Like it just came out of nowhere,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve read the intel too. And let me be clear: That\u2019s not what the intel says.\u201d\n\nUS defense and intelligence officials familiar with the information wouldn\u2019t provide me with any more information than is already public.\n\nBut what makes all this different from the Iraq War is that both Congress and the press are refusing to take the administration\u2019s claims at face value, and instead are pushing the Trump administration to back up those claims with actual proof.\n\n9) Does the US-Iran standoff have anything to do with oil?\n\nPretty much anytime talk of America going to war in the Middle East comes up, people wonder if it\u2019s merely a quest to control more oil. That\u2019s fair to an extent, as the US and other world powers have launched wars to take charge of energy sources.\n\nThat\u2019s not really the case here. What the US does care about, though, is ensuring that vessels are allowed to sail freely through the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial maritime passage aggressively patrolled by Iran where a third of the world\u2019s liquefied natural gas and almost 20 percent of the world\u2019s oil production flows. When US-Iran tensions spike, Iran typically threatens to shut down the strait.\n\nDoing so would send the global energy market into a tailspin and cause a worldwide crisis.\n\nBut Iran doesn\u2019t usually follow through with its bluster, surely aware of the fury it would face from the United States and others. So when news of the mystery attacks on oil tankers surfaced twice in two months, it raised worries that Tehran may have found a way to send a message.\n\n\u201cBy signaling that this supply is not safe and can be disrupted, Tehran is letting the world know it has escalation options,\u201d Behnam Ben Taleblu, an Iran expert at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, told me last month.\n\nBut while the continued supply of cheap oil is definitely important to the US, it\u2019s not really the reason some in the Trump administration are pushing for an Iran fight today. That really comes down to this: Bolton, Pompeo, and others want regime change in Iran, and are using intelligence that shows Tehran doing provocative things to advocate for a more combative stance.\n\nBut Trump is still the boss, and so far he\u2019s expressed no real appetite for war with Iran. Which means that a major, bloody conflict remains an unlikely possibility \u2014 at least for now.\n\nListen to this\n\nOn this episode of Vox\u2019s Worldly podcast, Zack Beauchamp and Alex Ward break down the past few weeks of worrying news about Iran.",
