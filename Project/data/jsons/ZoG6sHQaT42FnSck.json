    "content": "Anyone who brings up immigration at the Thanksgiving dinner table probably is n't looking to have their mind changed . A tremendous recent news story that brings up enduring questions of race and identity in America ? Not exactly the stuff of cool , reasoned debate . But that does n't mean you ca n't have a good conversation about it : here 's how to turn potential shouting matches into thoughtful discussions .\nResponse : Let 's take these issues one at a time . First of all , you can try to challenge you father-in-law 's use of `` illegal alien '' if you think your father-in-law is the sort of person who 'd stop using it if he found out it was n't actually the official legal term \u2014 but you might want to let it slide .\nSecond of all , what President Obama announced last week is n't actually legalization of anyone . What Obama is extending to some 4.3 million more unauthorized immigrants is a three-year grant of protection from deportation \u2014 called `` deferred action '' \u2014 with a work permit that 's valid for the same time . It does n't change them from being unauthorized immigrants , and it can easily be reversed or revoked .\nThat 's important , because the president simply does n't have the power to turn unauthorized immigrants into legal ones . But the executive branch does have the power to decide who should and should n't be deported , and it has the power to decide to give some form of temporary protection to unauthorized immigrants in the second category . For better or worse , the Immigration and Nationality Act gives a ton of power to the executive branch on immigration issues . That 's why even many conservative legal scholars agree that what Obama 's doing is legal and constitutional \u2014 even if they personally do n't agree with it .\nIf your father-in-law thinks it 's inappropriate to protect millions of people from deportation , you might want to ask him how much effort he thinks the government should be putting into deporting them . Deporting 11 million people would cost hundreds of billions of dollars \u2014 does he think that 's worthwhile ? Currently , there 's enough money to deport about 400,000 people a year \u2014 should those slots be reserved for criminals instead of parents of US citizens ? Is it important to him that every unauthorized immigrant feel that deportation is a constant threat ? What would satisfy him ?\nResponse : The question to ask here is , `` How do you define \u2018 secure ' ? ''\nBoth Democrats and Republicans have been trying to come up with metrics to define `` border security '' for more than a decade . But nothing they 've come up with has been satisfying . If you 're apprehending more immigrants , does that mean you 're doing a better job \u2014 or just that more people are coming over ? If you can see immigrants crossing the border , but ca n't physically apprehend them , is that an improvement ?\nYou ca n't totally seal the border . There are plenty of things and people who need to move back and forth : truckloads of goods , people who live on one side of the border but work on the other , people who are legally allowed to come into the US . And some people who come into the US without papers are actually following the law \u2014 if they 're coming to seek asylum , for example .\nUntil people can agree on a good definition of `` border security , '' it 's not going to be possible for Congress to come up with a bill that would actually fix the problem .\nResponse : You probably want to clarify that Obama 's new executive action does n't apply to anyone who 's coming in the future . The unauthorized immigrants who will be eligible for deferred action fall into the following groups : they are immigrants who came to the US before 2010 , and came when they were 15 or younger ; or they are immigrants who came to the US before 2010 , whose children are US citizens or green-card holders . In fact , the Obama administration ( which has already put a lot of effort into deporting people who are apprehended at the border ) has a new set of priorities for who will be deported \u2014 which could put future border crossers in even more danger .\nWhen most critics of the administration 's plan ask this question , they do n't mean that future unauthorized immigrants will actually be eligible for protection . They mean that the hope of future protection will be enough to make people want to come to the US illegally who would n't come otherwise .\nThis sounds logical , but is it actually the case ? Tell your cousin what happened after the 1986 Reagan `` amnesty '' \u2014 which also raised concerns that it would inspire future unauthorized migration . It does n't appear that it did so . Instead , the wave of unauthorized migration to the US peaked from 1996 \u2014 when a law passed that made it much harder to `` get legal '' if you were an unauthorized immigrant \u2014 to 2006 or so .\nExperts agree that the biggest pull for migrants , authorized or otherwise , is the state of the US economy ( compared to the economies in their home countries ) . That 's not something immigration policy can control \u2014 and besides , it would be foolish to tank the US economy just to deter unauthorized migration . But the wave after the 1996 law suggests that people want to be with their families \u2014 and if they ca n't cross the border back and forth to see their families , they 'll bring their families here . If that 's true , all Obama did last week is extend protection from deportation to people who would be here regardless .\nYour cousin might not be persuaded . So ask her : what would it take for her to go somewhere without papers ? Would she be willing to risk it for the chance of protection from deportation , 20 or 30 years down the road ? Would she do it for family ? For a job ? To flee persecution ?\nResponse : This is definitely a possibility ! For better or worse , the flip side of President Obama 's broad authority to choose who should be protected from deportation is that President Ted Cruz ( for example ) would have the authority to come into office in 2017 , scrap everything Obama 's done , and start over .\nThat 's going to be a problem in getting people to apply for the new protection-from-deportation program \u2014 which they have to do if they 're going to actually get protected , or get work permits . Is someone who 's lived in fear of the government for years really going to hand over all her personal information \u2014 information that could be used to deport her \u2014 in exchange for a few years of protection ?\nJust stripping protections from unauthorized immigrants is n't the same as ordering them deported , of course . Hypothetical President Cruz would still have to decide if it was worth spending limited deportation funds on parents of US citizens , simply because he had their information , instead of convicted criminals or new border crossers . ( You might want to bring your father-in-law into this conversation : how would he make that choice ? )\nBut this is a serious question for immigrants themselves \u2014 and for both political parties . Should Democrats be emphasizing the threat of a President Cruz , so that Latinos will turn out to vote in 2016 ? Or should they be emphasizing the safety of the program so that more immigrants will sign up now ? And should Republicans be openly threatening to use this information against immigrants if their party wins the presidency \u2014 or is that an immoral line to cross ?",
