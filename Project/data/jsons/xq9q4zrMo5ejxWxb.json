    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) On the fifth anniversary of Osama bin Laden 's death , President Barack Obama sharply defended his targeted approached to fighting terror -- and said the next president would most likely follow his lead rather than his predecessor 's .\n`` The kinds of Special Forces and intelligence-gathering that we saw in the bin Laden raid is going to be , more often than not , the tool of choice for a president in dealing with that kind of threat , '' he said .\n`` The ideology has not been extinguished , '' Obama acknowledged in an exclusive interview with CNN 's Peter Bergen on Monday night . `` The world is still dangerous . In many ways , the Middle East is in a more chaotic situation . ''\nBut -- without directly referring to President George W. Bush 's decisions to send U.S. troops into Afghanistan and then Iraq -- Obama said such large-scale operations , which continue to reverberate in the current presidential race , would only make the fight against extremism harder .\nObama said the idea of `` sending 100,000 troops to invade every country where an organization like this appears going be counterproductive and , in some ways , feeds the kinds of ideology that we 're fighting . ''\nObama offered the assessment as part of three hours of conversations Bergen had with the President and his top circle about details of the raid that killed bin Laden for the Anderson Cooper 360 special `` 'We Got Him , ' Obama , Bin Laden and the War on Terror . ''\nWhile Obama spoke with confidence of the decision to launch the raid despite the odds being `` probably 50/50 '' that that the U.S. was correct that the target in the Abbottabad , Pakistan , compound it was tracking was bin Laden , he did speak about the difficulty in making wrenching decisions , especially with the expanded use of drones during his presidency .\nUnmanned aircraft have become an invaluable tool in areas tough to reach with U.S. soldiers , Obama said . Within the first two years of his presidency , though , Obama said he felt the legal architecture and control systems in place to use them were n't enough .\n`` It became so easy to use them without thinking through all the ramifications , '' he said . `` What we 've tried to do is make sure that we are accountable at the highest levels for how we 're using Predators . ''\nThe standard is of `` near certainty '' that the target is an active terrorist threat and that civilian casualties are being avoided , the President said .\n`` Having said that , you always lose sleep because you know there 's always the possibility in a kinetic action that somebody who should n't be killed is killed , '' he said .\nJUST WATCHED President Obama on the order to kill Osama bin Laden Replay More Videos ...

''\nStill , Obama said that he did n't consider aborting the mission , even when it started with a downed helicopter .\n`` My initial concern there was extraction . That if something happened to the helicopter that we could make sure that we got our guys out , '' he said , pointing to the backup helicopters that had been prepared as part of their `` plan B .
