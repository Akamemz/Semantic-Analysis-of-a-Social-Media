Whether you \u2019 re asking it to slow down for selfish reasons or to speed up for someone else , it doesn \u2019 t make a difference . Time is relentless and uncaring ; it does not listen and it will not stop .\nBut even though it is ultimately an egalitarian ruler , wreaking havoc on the old , young , good and bad alike , Time seems to hold a special grudge against Loretta Lynch , the woman who , after an unprecedented delay , was finally sworn in on Monday as the 83rd attorney general in the history of the United States .\nThe first indication that Time has it in for Lynch was also the most obvious : the Senate \u2019 s 167-day-long dawdle . But while it was obviously wrong to make the first African-American woman ever nominated for the post wait so absurdly long to be confirmed ( only two of Lynch 's 82 predecessors waited longer ) , I \u2019 m hesitant to throw the fault entirely on Time \u2019 s shoulders . The attack was launched by Republicans , after all ; Time was merely their weapon .\nBut the second piece of evidence that Time may be holding a particular grudge against the attorney general was more palpable : the riots that convulsed Baltimore this weekend and paralyzed the city on Monday . Because although Lynch obviously had nothing to do with the disorder , the riots ' fires show with blinding clarity that Lynch \u2019 s first goal \u2014 which is \u201c improving police morale , \u201d according to the Times \u2014 is entirely premature . The wanton destruction of property can not be legitimated ; but simply criticizing anarchy and praising law enforcement wo n't bring the mayhem to an end . And it wo n't provide justice .\nIn many ways , the chaos in Baltimore is just the latest iteration of one of America \u2019 s saddest and longest-running stories . It is another example of what Martin Luther King once called \u201c the language of the unheard. \u201d King was speaking then of the riots that traumatized much of the country during the summer of 1966 . But the social ills he described as kindling for the riot \u2019 s fire \u2014 poverty , police brutality and malign neglect \u2014 are , despite the nearly 49 years that followed , still powerful forces in America today .\nFor this particular moment , though , it \u2019 s Baltimore Police Department 's documented history of lawless violence that 's been identified as the riots ' inspiration . Protestors and rioters \u2014 who , it \u2019 s worth noting , are usually not the same \u2014 cite as their catalyst the death of Freddie Gray , a 25-year-old African-American man and Baltimorean . On April 12 , Gray was arrested by officers from the BPD . When police detained Gray and put him in a van for transportation , he was walking ; by the time the trip was over , he had a broken neck . He died on April 19th .\nNo one yet knows for sure exactly what happened to Gray during that trip and in that van . There are reports that he was taken out at one point and beaten , but an autopsy showed no injuries except for those to his spinal cord and neck . The BPD has already admitted that its officers did not provide Gray with the necessary medical care . But the main question \u2014 Why was he able to run from the police in the morning , but struggling to breathe by nightfall ? \u2014 has gone unanswered , though an increasing number suspect the widespread , grotesque practice of giving \u201c a rough ride \u201d is to blame .\nYet the fact that such a thing could happen , and only become a major story after the activism of peaceful protesters ( and the destructive hijacking of violent rioters ) , is exactly the problem . The fact that the BPD \u2019 s reputation is such that many Baltimoreans heard Gray \u2019 s story with weary outrage rather than shock or indignation is exactly the problem . The fact that the BPD rank-and-file evidently feels so comfortable with extralegal brutality , and are so accustomed to wielding it , that demands for accountability has left them panicking \u2014 that , too , is exactly the problem .\nI \u2019 m quite certain that , at least to some extent , Attorney General Lynch would agree . But that \u2019 s why it \u2019 s so unfortunate that news of her interest in \u201c finding common ground between law enforcement and minority communities \u201d came when it did .
