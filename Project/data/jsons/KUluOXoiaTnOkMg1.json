In parkour there was this whole philosophical movement , no joke , about building yourself as a stronger , better individual . One of the sayings that I think very well displays the philosophy behind pretty much everything I do , it goes like this : To be strong to be useful . To be strong to serve . There was a moment in my life when I decided that I am a person that is for progress\u2014for good and against evil .\n`` It 's not just about being able to run fast , or jump obstacles , or jump from big heights . It 's also that sometimes you can not just run away . Maybe there 's someone with you , like your girlfriend or a kid that needs protection , and they can not run away , because they 're not as fast as you . What are you gon na do ? You 're gon na fight .\n`` When I started shooting , I thought , Hey , I can handle this . It 's a better weapon than my fists . This works on bigger distances , can stop a threat even without actually engaging them\u2014just by showing it\u2014and stuff like that .\n`` I heard that kung fu should be translated as\u2014how do you say it in English ? \u2014'the way of the work , ' 'the way of the labor . ' Basically it means the way of someone who works hard toward the goal that 's maybe not very achievable , but the way itself is the purpose . It 's always about getting better . It 's always about being safer , being a better person . And really , shooting is just another martial art for me . It 's just my kung fu . It is a discipline .\n`` I know there 's a danger always to it . I know sometimes people are not very responsible . But that 's the case with really every aspect of life . ''\n`` My favorite type of shooting is bench shooting , where you set up your rifle with a bipod or a filled sandbag or something\u2014basically keep it stationary with very fine adjustments while you 're holding it\u2014to shoot long ranges . Think , colloquially , sniping . I want a little piece of paper or a small steel gong about 100\u2013500 yards away from me and just put holes in that paper and make the steel ping a lot . For me it 's a nice place to focus . To sit , be introspective , almost zen out , get into myself , and just enjoy doing something on my own .\n`` One of the rifles I do not yet own is an AR-15-pattern rifle . The wonderful young lady I live with is averse to me building or buying an AR-15-pattern rifle because of its recent demonization in mass media .\n`` My first giant sticking point is that everyone says the AR [ stands for ] 'assault rifle ' and the 15 does n't mean anything . Well , if I hit you with a book , that is an assault book . If I hit you with a car , it 's an assault car . Assaulting is simply the matter of attacking somebody . AR is ArmaLite , the company that originally came up with the pattern adapted from Eugene Stoner 's M16 military rifle . It is just another rifle . If you put the exact same mechanism into a wooden stock , people go , 'Oh , it 's just a hunting rifle . That 's fine . ' Well , no . It fires the same exact way . It holds just as many bullets . ''\n`` It 'd be easy for me to be like , 'Oh , nobody needs a concealed-carry [ permit ] , ' because I live in this bougie apartment right across the street from the police station that 's mostly secure .

His language was old-school , and I ca n't repeat it verbatim , but it was basically : Any attempt to disarm the working-class needs to be obstructed by force . It 's always funny when people say the left wants to take away guns . It 's like , well , no , it 's not the left that wants to take away guns . It 's Democrats .
