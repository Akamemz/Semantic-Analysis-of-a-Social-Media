He 's playing members of the American public for suckers : He gets a free ride to the White House , and all we get is a lousy hat . ''\nRomney said that `` dishonesty is Donald Trump 's hallmark , '' pointing to his `` bullying , the greed , the showing off , the misogyny , the absurd third-grade theatrics . ''\nThere 's irony in Romney 's speech : Just four years ago , he courted Trump 's endorsement -- even after Trump had led the `` birther '' controversy against President Barack Obama , insisting that Obama release his birth certificate to prove he is an American citizen .\n`` He was begging for my endorsement . I could have said , 'Mitt , drop to your knees ' -- he would have dropped to his knees , '' he said .\nHe said of 2012 : `` That was a race , I have to say , folks , that should have been won ... I do n't know what happened to him . He disappeared . He disappeared . And I was n't happy about it , I 'll be honest , because I am not a fan of Barack Obama , because I backed Mitt Romney -- I backed Mitt Romney . You can see how loyal he is . ''\nHe said Romney thought about running again in 2016 , but `` chickened out . ''\nRomney tweeted after his own speech but before Trump 's that had the New York businessman made similar statements about the KKK and others in 2012 , he would not have accepted the endorsement .\n`` If Trump had said 4 years ago the things he says today about the KKK , Muslims , Mexicans , disabled , I would NOT have accepted his endorsement .
