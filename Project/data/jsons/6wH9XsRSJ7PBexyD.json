Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) September 6 , 2019\nActing Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke set a timeline for DACA \u2019 s termination in September 2017 . In a memo explaining her decision , Duke said then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions told DHS that the program is unlawful . She further noted that a coalition of states was threatening to sue the federal government over DACA in view of the 5th Circuit \u2019 s DAPA decision .\nDuke \u2019 s memo prompted a flurry of litigation . Federal trial judges in California , New York , and Washington , D.C. , blocked the order on a nationwide basis . Neither the plaintiffs nor the lower courts believe Trump lacks the power to terminate DACA . Instead , the challengers say Duke \u2019 s memo is \u201c arbitrary and capricious \u201d under the Administrative Procedure Act ( APA ) and must be set aside .\nThe APA requires that the government provide clear , reasoned explanations for new policy . The plaintiffs argue Duke \u2019 s memo is a \u201c superficial explanation \u201d that \u201c fails to explain the Acting Secretary \u2019 s reasoning , \u201d and thus violates the APA . The challengers say a second memo former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen issued on DACA \u2019 s termination in June 2018 is similarly deficient .\n\u201c It is truly remarkable that a Cabinet-level officer would offer such a cursory explanation for a decision that affects hundreds of thousands of lives and reverses a longstanding and carefully-reasoned government position , \u201d the plaintiffs told the high court in legal briefs . \u201c The APA requires more . \u201d\nThe Trump administration argues its decision to cancel DACA is not subject to APA arbitrary and capricious review in court . That \u2019 s because the APA doesn \u2019 t apply to actions \u201c committed to agency discretion by law. \u201d Rescinding a non-enforcement policy like DACA is a \u201c quintessential \u201d example of agency discretion , the government said in legal filings , much like a prosecutor \u2019 s decision to pursue or decline indictments . The government \u2019 s discretion is especially powerful in the immigration area , the administration adds .\nJustice Samuel Alito seemed to agree with those propositions . He compared the DACA dispute to a case involving a hypothetical Justice Department decision not to prosecute cases of cocaine possession below certain amounts . Ted Olson , a lawyer challenging DACA \u2019 s termination , agreed Alito \u2019 s cocaine example could not be challenged in court .\n\u201c Well , what \u2019 s the difference ? \u201d Alito shot back . Justice Neil Gorsuch expressed similar doubts .\nEven if its decision can be reviewed in court , the administration says the Duke and Nielsen memos give ample grounds for ending DACA that the courts must accept . The left-leaning justices were particularly dubious of that claim , saying those materials did not address real-world consequences in a meaningful way . Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointedly accused the government of blaming the law to dodge political heat .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a whole lot of reliance interests that weren \u2019 t looked at , including the current president telling DACA-eligible people that they were safe under him and that he would find a way to keep them here , \u201d Sotomayor told Solicitor General Noel Francisco .\n\u201c Where is all of this really considered and weighed ? \u201d she added . \u201c Where is the political decision made clearly , that this is not about the law , this is about our choice to destroy lives . \u201d\n\u201c We own this , \u201d Francisco said in reply . ( RELATED : Supreme Court Hears Aaaarguments Over Blackbeard \u2019 s Pirate Wreck )\nJustice Stephen Breyer referenced numerous amicus ( or \u201c friend of the court \u201d ) briefs from businesses , labor unions , and religious organizations describing the benefits DACA recipients provide their organizations .
