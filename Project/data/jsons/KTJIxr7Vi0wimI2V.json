    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) President Barack Obama made a feisty pitch for economic populism in his penultimate State of the Union Tuesday night , touting the improving economy on his watch and making the case that government has a role in ensuring equal opportunity for all .\nObama began his speech at 9:10 p.m. in front of a joint session of the House and Senate , declaring that `` the shadow of crisis has passed , and the state of the union is strong . ''\n`` At this moment -- with a growing economy , shrinking deficits , bustling industry , and booming energy production -- we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth , '' he said .\n`` It 's now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next fifteen years , and for decades to come , '' he said . `` Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well ? Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort ? ''\nObama argued that a raft of new policy proposals \u2014 which include an ambitious plan to raise taxes on wealthy Americans and financial institutions to pay for progressive priorities \u2014 favor the middle class , and that `` middle-class economics works . ''\nAnd he laid down the gauntlet to Republicans : They 'll `` continue to work , as long as politics do n't get in the way . ''\nIt 's a defiant speech for the President , now freed from the shackles of vulnerable red-state Democrats up for re-election and looking to burnish his legacy in his final two years .\nInstead of granting Republicans their wish for a realistic compromiser-in-chief chastened by a midterm election drubbing , Obama is attempting to set the terms of an economic debate that could continue into the 2016 race to replace him in the Oval Office .\nHe called for cooperation , reprising the theme that there is n't a `` red America '' or `` blue America '' from the 2004 Democratic National Convention speech that shot Obama into stardom . And he flashed a renewed confidence , going off-script after touting the improving economy to say , `` This is good news , people '' -- and followed it with a wink .\nLater , when Obama said he had no campaigns left to run and some Republicans sarcastically clapped , the President shot back : `` I know , 'cause I won both of them . ''\nAt the heart of his message is a Robin Hood-style plan to raise taxes on wealthy Americans ' investments and financial institutions and use that money to foot the bill for free community college tuition and new tax credits for child care and two-worker households .\nThat proposal stands next to no chance of clearing Congress . But -- along with campaign-style events and interviews with YouTube stars touting his initiatives both before and after the speech -- Democrats hope Obama 's decision to play up the parties ' philosophical differences will remind Republicans who now control both the House and the Senate of the political force they could n't overcome in 2008 and 2012 .\nRepublicans , though , see a President in denial -- one who has n't learned anything from the shellacking that cost his party the Senate in November ; whose veto threats and tax-and-spend proposals are a lame duck flailing as his influence fades .\nThe President 's `` proposals are so out of touch you have to ask if there is any point to the speech , '' Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus tweeted .\nFreshman Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst delivered the GOP 's response , calling on Obama to `` cooperate '' with congressional leaders to advance new trade pacts and overhaul the tax code .\nBut she also said now that her party controls both the House and the Senate , changes are coming -- and she hit Obama 's signature health care law while doing it .\n`` Americans have been hurting , but when we demanded solutions , too often Washington responded with the same stale mindset that led to failed policies like Obamacare , '' Ernst said . `` It 's a mindset that gave us political talking points , not serious solutions . ''\nObama 's 2012 Republican opponent , Mitt Romney -- who is considering a 2016 run for the White House -- called the speech `` disappointing . ''\nRomney said Obama `` is more interested in politics than in leadership . More intent on winning elections than on winning progress , he ignores the fact that the country has elected a Congress that favors smaller government and lower taxes . ''\nBut Hillary Clinton , the leading 2016 Democratic contender , praised Obama 's speech , tweeting that the President `` pointed [ the ] way to an economy that works for all . Now we need to step up and deliver for the middle class . ''\nJUST WATCHED Obama pitches community college plan Replay More Videos ...

Paying most of the price would be couples earning more than $ 500,000 , who would see their capital gains rate jump from 23.8 % to 28 % .

But we will succeed , '' he said . `` And tonight , I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL . ''\nCYBERSECURITY : The President asked Congress to approve legislation that would allow government and businesses to work together more closely to thwart online attacks -- a proposal that could win the support of the GOP-led Congress .\n`` No foreign nation , no hacker , should be able to shut down our networks , steal our trade secrets , or invade the privacy of American families , especially our kids , '' Obama said . `` We are making sure our government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats , just as we have done to combat terrorism .

''\nIRAN : The White House had extended the deadline for its negotiations with Iran to end the country 's nuclear program , but lawmakers have said they 've run out of patience with the Iranian regime and want to impose new sanctions . Obama urged them to wait\n`` There are no guarantees that negotiations will succeed , and I keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran . But new sanctions passed by this Congress , at this moment in time , will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails -- alienating America from its allies ; and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again , '' he said . `` It does n't make sense . That is why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress . ''\nFREE TRADE : Obama risked angering his own base by asking lawmakers to hand him authority to fast-track Pacific Rim and European Union trade deals through Congress with limited debate and no amendments -- a power seen as crucial to finalizing those negotiations with foreign leaders . He posited the trade deals as an opportunity to combat China 's growing influence in Asia .\n`` Why would we let that happen ? We should write those rules . We should level the playing field . That 's why I 'm asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers , with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that are n't just free , but fair , '' he said .\nAnd in a move to acknowledge liberal criticism , Obama said : `` Look , I 'm the first one to admit that past trade deals have n't always lived up to the hype , and that 's why we 've gone after countries that break the rules at our expense . But 95 % of the world 's customers live outside our borders , and we ca n't close ourselves off from those opportunities .

''\nINTERNET ACCESS : In an in-the-weeds regulatory proposal that could result in much-faster Internet access for many cities and states , Obama is calling on the Federal Communications Commission to override 19 states ' laws against municipalities setting up their own broadband infrastructure .\n`` I intend to protect a free and open Internet , extend its reach to every classroom , and every community , and help folks build the fastest networks , so that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world , '' Obama said .",
