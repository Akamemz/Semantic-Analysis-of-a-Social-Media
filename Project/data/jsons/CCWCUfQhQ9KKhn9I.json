What\u2019s going on?\n\nSeveral news organizations have gotten their hands on leaked documents that have to deal with offshore accounts, tax havens and policies being influenced by some Trump associates and cabinet members.\n\nAnd we\u2019re talking big numbers.\n\nTo start:\n\nThe 7 million internal documents, dubbed \u201cthe Paradise Papers,\u201d were handed over to German publication S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung by Appleby, a Bermuda-based law firm, and shared by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in partnership with others news outlets, including the Guardian, BBC and The New York Times.

Like the Panama Papers, the Paradise Papers revolve around the issue of offshore entities set up by members of the global elite. The Paradise Papers reportedly pinpoint over 120 politicians and royal leaders around the world who have connections to offshore finance, according to NBC News.\n\nThe global elite\u2026 so not just the GOPe?\n\nOf those connected to our current administration, the top of the list would be Wilbur Ross, Trump\u2019s Commerce Secretary.\n\nRoss apparently has some business ventures in common with the son-in-law of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Commerce Department now says Ross has recused himself from any dealings that relate to transoceanic shipping, and also has reached out to ethics officials, in order to assure his moves are ethical.\n\nSo who else is named in the documents known as the Paradise Papers?\n\nThe president\u2019s chief economic adviser Gary Cohn has held leading roles in 22 separate entities for Goldman Sachs in Bermuda between 2002 and 2006, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also directed a company in Bermuda in 1997, according to The Guardian. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman and House and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson are also mentioned in the leaked documents, according to The Guardian.\n\nBen Carson, too?\n\nNone of this is to suggest that what they\u2019re doing is illegal. If nothing else, these documents are an inside look at how the very rich are able to secure their assets offshore, where they\u2019ll be free from American laws on taxation.\n\nAnd it\u2019s all legal.\n\nWith Ross, the problem isn\u2019t with the holdings he divested, but with the ones he held on to, then wasn\u2019t forthcoming about during his confirmation hearing.\n\nSome lawmakers who sat in on Ross\u2019 confirmation hearing are saying they\u2019d be a bit less willing to have been so accepting of him, had they known about Ross\u2019 connection to the Kremlin through his holdings.\n\nFrom NBC News:\n\nIn his letter to the ethics official of the Commerce Department, Ross created two lists: those entities and interests he planned to get rid of and those he intended to keep.
