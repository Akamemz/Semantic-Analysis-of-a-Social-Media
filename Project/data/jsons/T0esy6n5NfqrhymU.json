Rapidly going from in-person voting to exclusively mail-in ballots is likely to disenfranchise some voters . At the very least , a state would need to engage in a fairly robust publicity and outreach campaign to pull this off . And more realistically , it would need to plan for some in-person voting , perhaps through a reduced footprint of sites , with expanded early-voting hours and public-health precautions\u2026 \u201c None of this is cheap . Furthermore , the states , which are already facing huge public safety costs amid declining tax revenues , are limited in their ability to borrow and will need help from Washington\u2026 The legislation sets aside $ 500 billion for bailouts for airlines and companies deemed to be of national security importance . Certainly , safe and fair elections are a matter of urgent national security as well. \u201d Editorial Board , USA Today\n\u201c [ The Supreme Court decision is ] the opening salvo in what is likely to be a seven-month long series of legal battles about how the 2020 elections will be accomplished with Covid-19 disrupting the voting process . So it \u2019 s highly unfortunate that the justices split along partisan lines in this first case , a case with relatively low stakes . The nation badly needs the court to avoid a scenario reminiscent of the 2000 Bush v. Gore case , in which the justices were perceived to have decided the election for Bush along roughly ideological lines\u2026 \u201c Given the likely effects of the pandemic on that election , there exists a substantial likelihood that both political parties will be poised to question the fairness of the election results . The only way to avoid a potentially serious legitimacy crisis is not to rely on the Supreme Court to resolve it . States need to put electoral processes in place early so that the rules are clear in advance . And we should avoid the temptation , however powerful , to expect the courts to tweak those rules to make them more \u2018 fair , \u2019 as measured by our own lights. \u201d Noah Feldman , Bloomberg\nRegarding the Supreme Court decision , \u201c In the main body of the opinion , you would never learn that a deadly pandemic even existed , let alone that it was the driving motivation of the district court \u2019 s decision . This is cowardly . If you want to make a case that the law is the law and it needs to be followed even in the middle of a destructive plague , then go ahead . But at the very least , you need to have the integrity to make the case . You need to be willing to say forthrightly that legal technicalities need to be followed even if they will either ( a ) deprive thousands of people of their votes or ( b ) drive them to the polls , where they run the risk of contracting a deadly disease. \u201d Kevin Drum , Mother Jones\n\u201c The motivations of [ the Republican legislators ] require little speculation . The marquee race in Wisconsin on Tuesday was not the Democratic presidential primary but the retention election for a highly conservative state Supreme Court justice , a race in which Wisconsin Republicans have a large stake . Before Tuesday \u2019 s election , Republican state lawmakers had already imposed an extremely gerrymandered legislative district map on Wisconsin , mandated strict voter-ID requirements and stripped powers from Mr. Evers\u2026 \u201c Forcing voters to make a potentially deadly decision about whether to show up , thereby discouraging turnout , was yet another move in their bare-knuckle fight to hold on to power , even at the expense of democracy. \u201d Editorial Board , Washington Post\n\u201c Evers tried to move the date to June 9 , first by calling a special legislative session this weekend and then through executive order on Monday night . Both times , he was overruled by Wisconsin Republicans in the state legislature and the state Supreme Court . Republican leaders in the state legislature gaveled out of the weekend special session almost immediately after it was convened\u2026 \u201c Many voters who had requested absentee ballots had yet to receive them as of Monday evening , meaning that people probably wouldn \u2019 t be able to postmark them by the required Tuesday , April 7 , deadline . According to the Wisconsin Elections Commission , roughly 408,000 absentee ballots still hadn \u2019 t been returned across the state as of Tuesday morning\u2026 Absentee ballots in Wisconsin also require a witness to sign the ballot , a requirement that \u2019 s incredibly limiting during the current public health crisis , where people are being advised to stay away from others\u2026 \u201c The handling of Tuesday \u2019 s primary is expected to hurt specific subsets of voters disproportionately , including black voters , older voters , and voters with disabilities. \u201d Ella Nilsen and Li Zhou , Vox\nThe right is critical of both parties in Wisconsin for not delaying the election and supports the Supreme Court \u2019 s decision .\nThe right is critical of both parties in Wisconsin for not delaying the election and supports the Supreme Court \u2019 s decision .\n\u201c Rather than come together in an emergency , the scorched-earth politics of the last ten years \u2014 initiated by a legislative walkout and a union-backed futile recall election \u2014 rendered the state government incapable of the simple task of delaying the primary by a few weeks\u2026\n\u201c Evers has been all over the place on this point rather than demonstrating any real leadership on it . However , the Republican-controlled legislature hasn \u2019 t fared much better . They could have passed a delay when they were finally called into special session over the weekend , but chose not to act instead . Evers \u2019 flip-flopping didn \u2019 t give them much political cover for delaying the primary , but they probably didn \u2019 t need much political cover for it , either . Voters who have to go out and stand in line today are likely to say a pox on both houses as a result , irony fully intended . And they would not be wrong . \u201d\n\u201c Why did Evers , a Democrat , wait until April 3 , just days before the polls would open , to call a legislative session to postpone the election ? Of course , struggles with absentee ballot requests overwhelming the system , and poll volunteers withdrawing over health concerns surely held the governor and district judge \u2019 s feet to the flame . But with a global health crisis that had been ramping up for months and other states taking early measures to postpone their elections , is it possible the last-minute decisions regarding the Wisconsin election were actually the result of poor leadership and planning rather than of GOP-fueled partisanship within the Supreme Court ? \u2026\n\u201c While much of this saga could have been avoided absent obvious blunders in the Dairy State , this coronavirus-prompted mess certainly could have serious implications not only for other state primaries and even the upcoming Democratic National Convention , but even for the general election this fall . If we can learn anything from Wisconsin about coronavirus and election panics , maybe it \u2019 s that it \u2019 s time to start thinking about November . \u201d\n\u201c We might beat COVID-19 by fall . But if we don \u2019 t , what happens to our November election ? Two principles are paramount . The election must be held . And people who want to vote must be able to do so without fear of infection and without worsening the pandemic . To uphold those principles , we must expand no-excuse absentee voting and make drive-through voting possible\u2026\n\u201c These changes will neither clearly help one party at the other \u2019 s expense , nor increase voter fraud . The No . 1 group that votes by mail now are the elderly , who tend to vote Republican . As the elderly are also the group most affected by COVID-19 , voting by mail might help them the most . On the other hand , increased turnout is typically good for Democrats , who benefit from greater youth and minority votes\u2026\n\u201c The truth is that no one knows whom expanded absentee voting and drive-through voting would favor in November 2020 . That should make it easier to set aside our partisan identities and do what is right for democracy . So long as the change is a one-off , which can be written into state and federal legislation , it should overcome partisan bickering . \u201d\nUnder the ruling overturned by the Supreme Court , \u201c absentee ballots were eligible to be counted regardless of when they were mailed in or otherwise delivered , as long as they came in by the April 13 deadline .
