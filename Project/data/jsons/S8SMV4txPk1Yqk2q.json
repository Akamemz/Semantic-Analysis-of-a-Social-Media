Her fear of unscripted moments has hindered her ability to connect emotionally with voters . She 's an unnatural politician whose penchant for moderation is a vulnerability in this political climate .\nTo be fair , Clinton has been on the ugly end of Republican attacks for decades \u2013 a little guardedness is pardonable . But a play-it-safe approach seemed unnecessarily risky against an omnipresent juggernaut like Trump . The Republican nominee 's campaign depends upon free media . In many ways , what Trump says or does with his airtime is irrelevant \u2013 the point is to be seen and heard . He can lie and distort with impunity ; his supporters do n't care and he dominates headlines all the same .\nWith that in mind , I suggested Clinton 's plan to lay low and let surrogates do her bidding was a bad idea , and that she ought to steal the spotlight from Trump whenever and wherever she can . The same , I reasoned , was true for Democrats and down-ballot races .\nDemocrats still should n't take anything for granted , but I no longer believe there 's any reason to compete with Trump for airtime . If we 've learned anything in the last couple of weeks , it 's that Trump will never morph into a sane , pragmatic candidate . He was never going to conform to political norms , but one assumed he would tone it down a bit as we approached November . Instead , he 's quadruple downed on his racist comments about a Mexican-American judge and , more recently , accused President Obama of being a Muslim Manchurian candidate who may or may not be complicit in the recent terror attacks in Orlando .\nNow that Trump is speaking to a general electorate , he 's paying a higher price for his racist drivel . Indeed , the latest NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll finds Hillary Clinton now leading Donald Trump nationally by eight points ( 49 percent to 41 percent ) . This gap will grow as Democrats unify and the Republican nominee continues unraveling in public . Even the political press is challenging Trump in ways that appear to have stunted his momentum .\nAccording to a Politico report , Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid is now encouraging Democratic senate candidates to sit back and watch Trump discredit himself and everyone associated with him , including GOP candidates who 've endorsed him . It 's a time-tested strategy : When your enemy is imploding , let him . And that 's what Democrats are doing .\nCalling it a \u201c shock and blah campaign , \u201d Politico reporter Burgess Everett writes : \u201c The blah comes from the Democratic candidates themselves ... They 're intentionally playing it safe and boring , figuring their elections will mostly be a referendum on Trump and that animosity toward the real estate magnate will put them over the top in key swing states . \u201d\nTo the extent that Democrats are attacking at all , they 're keeping it simple .
