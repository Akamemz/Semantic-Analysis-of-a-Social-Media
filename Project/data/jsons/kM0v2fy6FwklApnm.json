    "content": "The death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia doesn \u2019 t merely mark a tragedy for Constitutional philosophy \u2013 it may mark the death of American Constitutionalism as a whole .\nScalia \u2019 s philosophy of jurisprudence is well-known and shaped two generations of conservative thinkers : the Constitution ought to be interpreted according to its original meaning . This shouldn \u2019 t have been a groundbreaking notion given that most legislation is interpreted according to those rules , but because leftist jurists have spent a century chiseling away at the meaning of the Constitution based on their personal political beliefs , Scalia \u2019 s reinvigoration of traditional interpretive methodologies made him a historic figure . Scalia \u2019 s brilliant , passionate writing style made him author of some of the most famous dissents in Supreme Court history , and channeled the modern conservative frustration with the continuing abandonment of the Constitution .\nScalia \u2019 s jurisprudence also reminded conservatives that there is no substitute for proven Constitutional originalism . Most conservatives ignored that when they greenlit the appointment of cipher John Roberts for Chief Justice of the Supreme Court , a point I made when he was appointed . But Scalia provided a consistent reminder that Constitutional philosophy matters . It isn \u2019 t just a game of doing whatever you want politically . Constitutional jurisprudence is about recognizing the limits of the federal government \u2013 and recognizing the limits of the politicization of the Court itself .\nIn the end , Scalia \u2019 s death could mark the end of the Constitution itself . That \u2019 s because the current Supreme Court rested , until Scalia \u2019 s death , on the vague , confused , indeterminate philosophy of Justice Anthony Kennedy , who apparently decides cases on the basis of whether he has a solid bowel movement that morning . That means that half the time , the Constitution has a shot , as in Citizens United ; the other half of the time , the Constitution drains away into the mists of Kennedy \u2019 s magical social justice thinking , as in Obergefell .\nUnlike Kennedy , Scalia represented a consistent vote for a Constitution beyond modern progressive power politics . But with his death , President Obama now has the power to appoint a fifth justice to join hard-left social engineers Elena Kagan , Sonia Sotomayor , Stephen Breyer , and Ruth Bader Ginsburg . If the Republican Senate allows President Obama to select Scalia \u2019 s successor , the left will have a complete monopoly on the Supreme Court . Within the next few years , Citizens United will be overturned , restoring limits on free speech ; the Supreme Court will render the Second Amendment meaningless by reinterpreting the right to bear arms as a non-personal right ; freedom of religion will be made subservient to same-sex marriage and abortion priorities ; the death penalty will be ruled unconstitutional ; unions will be allowed to continue confiscating the dollars of people who disagree with them politically ; redistricting along leftist lines will return . Scalia ensured that the Supreme Court wasn \u2019 t a transformative institution ; now it will become the chief tool in the left \u2019 s arsenal .\nIt \u2019 s a sad commentary on the state of conservative politics that the only thing standing between the United States and the death of its founding document was a brilliant 79-year-old jurist .
