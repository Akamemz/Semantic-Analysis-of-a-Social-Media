    "content": "National attention has focused on a handful of young , left-wing first-time members of Congress elected to safe seats . But realistically , the future of the House lies with a larger group of Democrats who eked out narrow wins in newly purple districts .\n\u201c Most of the freshmen come from swing districts , \u201d said Rep. Tom Malinowski ( D-NJ ) , who beat four-term incumbent Republican Leonard Lance by 5 points in 2018 . \u201c We come from places where voters want us to focus on getting things done that can actually be achieved . \u201d\nRep. Katie Hill ( D-CA ) , who defeated GOP Rep. Steve Knight in a Los Angeles district long held by Republicans , says she is a \u201c pragmatic progressive. \u201d Rep. Abigail Spanberger ( D-VA ) , the former CIA agent who defeated Tea Party stalwart Dave Brat , calls it \u201c passionate pragmatism . \u201d\nWhatever you call it , these members are less interested in a 70 percent top tax rate or a Green New Deal than they are in passing targeted fixes to protect the Affordable Care Act and lower the cost of health care , promoting renewable energy , and maybe looking for an infrastructure deal to fix crumbling roads and boost rural broadband to speed up slow internet in their districts . They \u2019 re happy to discuss the more ambitious policy ideas animating the left , like Medicare-for-all , but they still have serious reservations .\nA dozen interviews in the first weeks of the new Congress reveal that one of the biggest limiting factors for any future progressive legislative agenda will be what these Democrats from the swing districts are willing to talk about .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a number of us who are really , really passionate about the reasons why we \u2019 re here . But through a real pragmatic lens , \u201d Spanberger told \u2588\u2588\u2588 in a recent interview . \u201c Voters trusted us , went outside their normal voting patterns , so we have a tremendous obligation . \u201d\nModerate first-term Democrats want to fix Obamacare before they think about Medicare-for-all\nBen McAdams , the former Salt Lake County mayor who was elected by one of the most conservative Democratic-held districts in a squeaker , is a Medicare-for-all skeptic . People should have a little skin in the game , he said . If health care is free , then people might use more health care , which drives up costs . He wants moderate voices to have a place in the debate , saying : \u201c Congress should be a free market of ideas . \u201d\nRep. Katie Porter ( D-CA ) , who narrowly defeated Mimi Walters , is an exception in this red-to-blue cohort , an ardent Medicare-for-all supporter and Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D-MA ) disciple . Rep. Dean Phillips ( D-MN ) , on the other hand , doesn \u2019 t think Medicare-for-all should be the starting point of the health care debate .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think there are many Republicans that wouldn \u2019 t agree with the outcome of access to high-quality care at affordable prices , \u201d Phillips said . Phillips said his first priority is to shore up the ACA , but he is open to new ideas for expanding health care , like a Medicare buy-in .\n\u201c I \u2019 m trying to find a way to build bridges to conservative thinking , which demands competition and freedom to choose , \u201d he said . \u201c So have a public option ! Give people the freedom to choose . \u201d\nMany first-term Democrats are loyal to the health care law we already have , like Lauren Underwood , a former Health and Human Services official under Obama , who trounced Illinois Republican Randy Hultgren by running on saving the Affordable Care Act .\n\u201c I came here on a mission to help fix our health care system , \u201d Underwood said . She \u2019 s urging a funding injection to increase competition in the ACA \u2019 s markets and , as a former nurse , she wants to focus on building out America \u2019 s health care workforce .\nWhat about a Green New Deal ? a reporter asked her . Underwood shrugged .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t know that much about it , \u201d she said . \u201c I \u2019 ve just seen hashtags . \u201d\nThe moderate freshmen are trying to bring back \u201c Infrastructure Week \u201d\nWhile \u201c infrastructure week \u201d has become a joke in Washington , many first-term Democrats are achingly serious about it .\n\u201c We have a tunnel we need to dig , \u201d said Malinowski , referring to Trump blocking the funding for the Gateway Tunnel between New York and New Jersey . \u201c Before we build any walls , we want to focus on some bridges and tunnels in New Jersey . \u201d\nFrom bumper-to-bumper traffic on New Jersey roads to aging water infrastructure leaching chemicals into the water in Michigan to need for rural broadband in districts around the country , there are real projects Democrats want to see funded .\n\u201c Our aging infrastructure is starting to affect the health of our children , our families , and the ability to grow our economy , \u201d Rep. Mikie Sherrill ( D-NJ ) , a rising Democratic star in a suburban district that had been held by Republicans since the mid-1980s , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nHill is hoping to get funding for environmental clean-ups . Her district is bordered by the Santa Susana Field Laboratory , the site of nuclear and rocket testing for decades before it ended last decade . The area has dealt with serious contamination , which has seeped into the surrounding lands represented by Hill . Cancer rates are high there . It \u2019 s a big mess and she hopes to find more funding to ramp up and finish the clean-up efforts .\nRep. Joe Cunningham , the Democrat who pulled off a surprise win of former Rep. Mark Sanford \u2019 s seat in Charleston , South Carolina , has already introduced his first bill to institute a 10-year ban offshore drilling on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts .\n\u201c Our district is the area from Charleston all the way down to Hilton Head , and so our beaches , our estuaries and marshes , they \u2019 re our pride and joy , \u201d Cunningham told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c We \u2019 re going to fight this thing tooth and nail from every angle and make sure there \u2019 s never a drop of oil on our beaches . \u201d\nCleaning up corruption is one unifying theme for the freshman class\nOne unifying front among Democratic first-term House members , from the centrists in swing districts to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , is cleaning up Washington . Many of them campaigned on that promise . House Democratic leadership is pushing a sweeping anti-corruption and voting rights plan , and first-term Democrats across the political spectrum want to see it passed .\nComing from districts more evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans , though , these first-term members tend to be less preoccupied with Trump himself and instead emphasize the need to fix the systematic problems they see in politics today .\n\u201c First and foremost is anti-corruption through and through , \u201d Rep. Max Rose ( D-NY ) , an outspoken new Congress member who represents Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c We \u2019 ve got to change the way this town operates . \u201d\nMany new Democratic House members say corruption should the first thing on the agenda . They believe it \u2019 s a necessary first step before they address any of the party \u2019 s other policy priorities .\n\u201c You \u2019 ve got all these issues \u2014 health care , income inequality , immigration . Real reform can not happen unless we deal with the underlying issue , \u201d Hill told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c People don \u2019 t have a voice and big corporations are buying access . \u201d\nThey know the Senate won \u2019 t take up the bill \u2014 they \u2019 re new to Congress , not naive \u2014 but they want to demonstrate they tried to do something .\n\u201c It \u2019 s easier as a first-time candidate on the campaign trail to say things in Washington are broken , [ but ] you can only say that once , \u201d Spanberger said .\nIt \u2019 s hard to be a new Congress member and get things done \u2014 but this class doesn \u2019 t lack for ambition\nThese Democrats are elbowing their way into the conversations that matter . Underwood , who sits on the influential House Democratic steering committee that set \u2019 s the party \u2019 s agenda in the House , blanched at the possibility of her colleagues being relegated to less influential positions .\n\u201c Certainly it \u2019 s not like these freshmen come in , and it \u2019 s like , \u2018 Okay , here \u2019 s your seat at the leadership table , \u2019 \u201d Rose said .
