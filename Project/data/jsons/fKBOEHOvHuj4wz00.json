Perhaps , but what about the risks to Americans ? From the outbreak \u2019 s start , Frieden has predicted that patients infected with Ebola will fly to the U.S. and seek care in hospitals here .\nWhether -- or how many -- Americans die of Ebola will depend on what hospitals do when travelers carrying the disease arrive in the emergency room . Frieden claims hospitals are well prepared . The truth is , some are but many are not .\nCities like Dallas and New York are home to enclaves of Liberians and other West African newcomers , making it all the more likely that visitors from West Africa could be headed there .\nIn Dallas , the infected traveler , Thomas Eric Duncan , went to the emergency room on Sept. 25.He told one nurse he had just come from Liberia , but that critical fact was ignored , and he was sent home with antibiotics instead of being put into isolation and tested .\nThe hospital \u2019 s epidemiologist , Dr. Edward Goodman claims \u201c we have had a plan in place for some time now for a patient presenting with possible Ebola. \u201d Not a very good plan , obviously .

The emergency staff who originally treated him and the three ambulance personnel are now under observation for Ebola .\nThe infection control mistakes at Texas Presbyterian are reminiscent of what ended up killing44 people in Toronto when SARS ( severe acute respiratory syndrome ) struck therein March , 2003 .\nA patient who had unknowingly picked up the virus from an Asian traveler went to a Toronto hospital for help and was left sitting in a crowded emergency room for 16 hours , infecting others , before the staff realized he might have SARS and isolated him .\nIn contrast , when a SARS-infected traveler sought care at a Vancouver hospital with rigorous infection control , he was isolated within five minutes , and not one other person there contracted the disease.One hospital averted an outbreak .
