    "content": "DES MOINES , Iowa \u2014 Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz were n't the only candidates in Iowa this weekend , but they might as well have been .\nBeginning with their Friday night appearances here at the Family Leader Forum \u2014 an audition of sorts before the influential Christian conservative group and its leader , Bob Vander Plaats \u2014 the outline of their looming showdown began to take shape . And Iowa Republicans , including the 2,000 people in attendance at the event , began taking a much closer look at a rivalry that could determine the outcome of the Feb. 1 caucuses .\nAt the outset of a five-day Rubio swing across Iowa , his longest yet , the two Cuban-American , first-term senators were n't on equal footing : Rubio has n't spent nearly as much time in the state as Cruz . There \u2019 s also a perception that the Rubio campaign \u2019 s organization isn \u2019 t up to snuff \u2014 or at least by comparison with the Texas senator \u2019 s robust network of support . According to the most recent Iowa poll , Cruz has surged to second place here , behind only Donald Trump and with roughly twice as much support as Rubio , who now occupies fourth place .\nBut the Florida senator \u2019 s strong performances in the first four national debates have won over major donors and piqued interest from rank-and-file Republicans just as Cruz \u2019 s campaign is hitting its stride here , 70 days ahead of the caucuses .\n\u201c Once Trump and [ Ben ] Carson \u2019 s descent becomes more rapid , it \u2019 s Cruz \u2019 s to lose , \u201d said Douglas Gross , who was Mitt Romney \u2019 s Iowa finance chairman four years ago and has yet to settle on a 2016 candidate . \u201c He has the best opportunity , and if he can get a good share of the Christian conservatives and the tea party , that should be enough to win right there .\n\u201c His only real competition is Rubio , whose challenge is to take some of the evangelical right and become the mainstream candidate for the establishment Republicans , \u201d Gross said .\nThe expectation that Trump and Carson are near the apex of their support \u2014 or will soon be in eclipse \u2014 is fueling interest in Rubio and Cruz , both of whom are vying to be safe harbors for evangelical and tea party voters .\n\u201c Trump \u2019 s out there in the front , but he \u2019 s not presidential . He \u2019 s not going to make it . So it \u2019 s shifting . Ted Cruz has been more available , and he has quite a following , especially the younger generation . And he comes here regularly , '' said Greg Crawford of Des Moines , who , along with his wife , Julie , listened to seven GOP presidential hopefuls for three hours Friday . `` But there is a lot of interest in seeing more of Rubio , because we 've all seen in the debates how smart he is and how he can be inspiring . Everyone is starting to sense it coming down to those two . ''\nIf Cruz secures Vander Plaats ' endorsement before the end of the year , he \u2019 ll have assembled a formidable roster of Iowa \u2019 s Christian conservative influencers , having already won the backing of Congressman Steve King and scores of conservative pastors .\n\u201c If you go to my church on Saturday , every car will have a Cruz sticker on it , \u201d said Matt Wells , a Cruz volunteer from Iowa City who attended the Family Leader Forum on Friday night . \u201c Marco \u2019 s not been in the state that much . \u201d\nWhile Cruz holds the edge with Christian conservatives , Rubio is working diligently to peel some of his support away .

While Cruz may have the advantage with evangelicals , Rubio believes he \u2019 ll be able to draw support from across the primary electorate , from governance-minded establishment conservatives to tea party-oriented fiscal conservatives .\nBoth Cruz and Rubio are selling electability \u2014 though it is also a point of demarcation between them . In his closing statement on stage Friday night , Cruz made a point of arguing that the way to win the general election is to nominate a true conservative who inspires the party \u2019 s base to show up , blaming the GOP \u2019 s past losses on establishment candidates who had lukewarm support from the base .\nRubio rarely speaks to voters so explicitly about his own electability as a charismatic , young Hispanic conservative .
