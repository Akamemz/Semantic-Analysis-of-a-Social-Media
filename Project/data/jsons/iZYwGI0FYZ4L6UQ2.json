The chain ends with Band urging Abedin , \u201c better if you call him . Now preferable . This is very important . \u201d\nThere \u2019 s no evidence showing what Clinton \u2019 s aides did with the request , although Abedin appears eager to help Band , referring him quickly to the Lebanese ambassador . And it \u2019 s possible that Chagoury was trying to help the U.S. , as one former Obama administration official noted , by alerting the ambassador to a threat in Lebanon . `\nEither way , the foundation was seeking special access for a donor \u2014 itself a violation of the spirit , if not the letter , of the pledge Clinton and top foundation officials had signed , according to several ethicists .\n\u201c For the duration of my appointment as Secretary if I am confirmed , I will not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter involving specific parties in which The William J. Clinton Foundation ( or the Clinton Global Initiative ) is a party or represents a party , unless I am first authorized to participate , \u201d Clinton wrote in a Jan. 5 , 2009 , letter to State Department Designated Agency Ethics Official James H.

Clinton lawyer David Kendall signed a separate Jan. 5 , 2009 , letter outlining \u201c voluntary steps ... President Clinton intends to take to assist Senator Clinton to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest with her duties as Secretary of State . \u201d\nMeredith McGehee , policy director for the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center , said that the actual language of the pledge is \u201c not surprisingly , very lawyerly \u2026 [ and ] there is an argument to be made that Clinton herself has not violated what was in the pledge . \u201d\n\u201c Whether she or her aides have violated the spirit of the pledge \u2026 yeah , of course they have , \u201d McGehee said . \u201c The notion of continuing contact between the Clinton Foundation and the State Department \u2014 that was not supposed to happen . \u201d\nA Washington-based spokesman for Chagoury , said in a statement to The New York Times on Wednesday that Chagoury had been seeking to contact someone in the State Department to offer his perspective on the coming elections in Lebanon .

The State Department was forced to turn over the emails to Judicial Watch , a conservative watchdog group , in a Freedom of Information Act case .\nThe newly released emails became immediate fodder for Donald Trump \u2019 s campaign and other critics , who \u2019 ve charged the Clintons with using the foundation as a vehicle to peddle influence and employ top aides between campaigns while reaping positive headlines for its charitable work .\n\u201c It \u2019 s called pay for play , \u201d Trump said at a rally Wednesday . \u201c And some of these [ revelations ] were really , really bad and illegal .
