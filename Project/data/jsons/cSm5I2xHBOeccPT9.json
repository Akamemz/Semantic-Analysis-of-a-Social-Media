''\nFormer Congressional Budget Office Director Doug Holtz-Eakin says there 's no evidence to support the president 's claim .\n`` You can do the math , '' he says . `` Most of the policies in his claim could spend more , cover more things , provide more visits and charge less . '' But , he concludes , `` the arithmetic just does not work . ''\nObama \u2019 s remarks last month were an effort to deflect criticism for having earlier promised that people could keep their plans and doctors no matter what .\n`` Most people , he said , `` will be able to buy better plans for the same price or even cheaper than what they 've gotten before . ''\nA few days after that promise , the president appeared to downgrade the pledge somewhat , saying only that `` there 's a good chance that they 'll be able to buy better insurance at lower cost . ''\nThe promise that `` most people '' would be better off is sharply disputed by many , including a number of individuals experiencing sticker shock , including those with pre-existing conditions .\nThey include Tom Gialanella of Seattle , who had a policy that was renewed for years even after he had cancer -- not the kind of sub-standard policy the president likes to criticize .\nBut he says his new policy under ObamaCare `` went from $ 891 a month to $ 1,437 a month and also my deductibles all doubled . ''\nAndrew Leonard recently told \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 Greta Van Susteren that he `` would get the terrible , terrible plan with the $ 6,000 deductible . '' As far as the premiums are concerned , he said , `` I 'll pay $ 1,200 dollars a year for that and I 'll be less insured than I am today . ''\nAnalysts say those whose policies are canceled will get new coverage , but not at lower prices .\n`` What we 're seeing is that the new ObamaCare plans typically have higher deductibles than the old plans did , '' says Roy , along with `` a narrower choice of doctors and hospitals and yet higher premiums . ''\nDavid Hogberg of the National Center for Public Policy Research adds , '' It 's very easy for a bronze plan to have a deductible ( with ) total out of pocket costs that are $ 6,000 . ''\nThat , of course , means the individual does n't get a dollar of benefits until he or she has exceeded $ 6,000 in expenditures , much more than many young people spend on medical care .\nRosemary Gibson of the Hastings Center and author of `` The Battle Over Health Care '' points to a Nov. 14 letter from one of the top officials implementing the law that concedes subsidies wo n't help everyone .\nShe describes it as `` a letter from Gary Cohen to state health insurance commissioners saying while many people still have subsidies , there will still be some people who will be paying more than they were paying . ''\nIn fact , one insurance plan that asked not to be identified analyzed its pool of 375,000 people and found that , even after subsidies , only 10 percent would actually see a decrease in costs , while one third would face significant rate increases as a result of ObamaCare .",
