But they are tight in lots of places .\nDemocrats have repeatedly transformed special elections in what are otherwise safe GOP districts into dogfights over the past year and a half . There was no reason the contest in Ohio should have been tight . Former Rep. Pat Tiberi , R-Ohio , long held the district .\nPrior to that , Ohio Gov . John Kasich represented the district in Washington . But then again , Democrats have repeatedly put into play historically Republican districts in special elections .\nConsider contests in Kansas , Georgia , Montana and South Carolina . Democrats came close to winning them all \u2013 but didn \u2019 t . Democrats finally won a special election on GOP turf in late March . Rep. Conor Lamb , D-Pa. , emerged victorious \u2013 but barely .\nIn other words , Democrats are making things close lots of places that shouldn \u2019 t be close . That bodes well in the midterms as Democrats need to flip 23 seats to claim control of the House . But Democrats can not continue to repeatedly make races close and lose . That \u2019 s certainly not a recipe for victory in the House .\nConsider this comment from Rep. Ben Ray Lujan , D-N.M. , chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ( DCCC ) : \u201c That this race is too close to call speaks volumes about Danny O \u2019 Connor \u2019 s strength and Republicans \u2019 expensive , failed playbook . With twice as many registered Republicans as Democrats , this district should have been a slam dunk for the GOP , and the fact that we are still counting ballots is an ominous sign for their prospects in November . \u201d\nThe \u201c moral victories \u201d like those last year in Kansas , Georgia , Montana and South Carolina mean nothing . Democrats need to steal seats in districts which Republicans historically owned . And Democrats keep coming up short with the exception of Lamb \u2019 s victory .\nSpecial elections sometimes serve as a bellwether for the general election . But they stand alone as a snapshot in time . We don \u2019 t really know how engaged voters were in the Ohio special election in the dog days of August .\nThe \u201c moral victories \u201d like those last year in Kansas , Georgia , Montana and South Carolina mean nothing . Democrats need to steal seats in districts which Republicans historically owned . And Democrats keep coming up short with the exception of Lamb \u2019 s victory . \u2014 Chad Pergram\nWhether the state certifies Republican Troy Balderson as the victor or Democrat Danny O \u2019 Connor the outcome of an isolated contest .\nThat won \u2019 t be the case in the fall . There \u2019 s a big gubernatorial contest in Ohio . Sen. Sherrod Brown , D-Ohio , faces Rep. Jim Renacci , R-Ohio , in the Senate race . Results of those battles will significantly influence who wins the full , two-year House term in November .\nAlso , Ohio officials may not call the race for days or even weeks .\nThat doesn \u2019 t matter . The seat \u2019 s been vacant since Tiberi quit in the winter . The seat will just remain open for a little longer . The House isn \u2019 t formally in session again until September 4 . The House wasn \u2019 t going to swear-in the victor until then at the earliest .\nConsider the results of several counties in the district . The district consumes the northern part of Franklin County , Ohio . That county is home to Columbus and is the largest county in the state .\nDemocrats continue to do well on solid Democratic soil and increasingly dominate the suburbs . O \u2019 Connor ran up the scoreboard in Franklin County . But here \u2019 s the problem for Democrats and O \u2019 Connor : Delaware County immediately to the north of Franklin County is quintessentially suburban . It \u2019 s one thing for a Democrat to win the close-in suburbs of Columbus . It \u2019 s another for Democrats to expand their reach further to the exurbs like Delaware County .\nDemocrats must really perform well in areas like Delaware County to have a shot of winning the House . Consider pundits who view Rep. Barbara Comstock , R-Va. , as a target for a loss this fall .\nComstock represents a district in the distant suburbs of Washington , DC . The district then turns very rural ( kind of like Ohio \u2019 s 12th ) . Democrats need to extend their reach to the distant suburbs in order to get somewhere this fall .\nThen , look at Muskingum and Morrow Counties in Ohio . Both are rural . O \u2019 Connor wasn \u2019 t going to win there . The question then becomes how well O \u2019 Connor might perform in Muskingum and Morrow in an effort to offset the inherit Balderson advantage . O \u2019 Connor preliminarily bested percentages from Hillary Clinton in those counties in the 2016 presidential election . But for O \u2019 Connor to knock out Balderson means the Democrat needs to win just a few more votes in rural parts of the district .\nThis is something Democrats need in districts across the board this fall if there is to be any chance of a \u201c blue wave. \u201d Democrats appear to show more traction in these regions .
