Sessions said leaders want to start meeting as soon as the Senate returns October 28. The conference committee has until December 13 to come up with an agreement.\n\nHours after the bitter shutdown fight ended, the four top leaders on the House and Senate budget committees walked out of a meeting -- each wearing a smile and sounding notably warmer than weeks past.\n\n\"We want to look for ways to find common ground,\" said House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin. \"Our goal is to do good for the American people.\"\n\nThe others echoed the \"common ground\" theme.\n\n\"We believe there is common ground in showing the American people that Congress can work,\" said Senate Budget Chairman Patty Murray, D-Washington.\n\nThe examples of common ground were broad goals: a stronger economy, more jobs, a smaller deficit. The vast differences over how to accomplish those things were not mentioned, but have stymied Congress for years, including the high-profile and failed \"super committee in 2011.\n\nWhy would this group succeed?\n\n\"The super committee's goals were much larger,\" said Murray, who co-chaired the panel. \"(Our challenge) is to have a reconciliation between the House budget and the Senate budget.\"\n\nIn other words, the super committee aimed to come up with a long-term \"big deal\" for a decade or more. This budget conference committee could tackle some long-term items such as entitlement reform, but Murray said for now they mostly hope to outline spending and revenue for the next year or two.\n\nStill, the differences are wide as the conference committee tries to develop its blueprint for spending.\n\nThe Democratic Senate budget would spend at higher levels. The Republican House budget would cut more and significantly rework Medicare. Adding to the sense of contrast, Ryan and Sessions were among the Republicans who voted \"no\" Wednesday for the shutdown deal that Murray had championed.\n\nAt a later news conference, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi seemed to express skepticism. \"Senator Sessions and Paul Ryan did not vote for the bill last night.

I know that he's not going to vote for mine,\" she said. \"We are going to find the common ground between our two budgets that we both can vote on.\"\n\nThe conference committee marks a return to so-called \"regular order,\" the more normal operating procedures in Congress. But \"regular order\" has been highly irregular in recent years. The last successful budget conference committee was in 2009.\n\nThat truth came out for just a moment Thursday.\n\n\"There's a number of things I know we can agree on,\" Sessions started. Then he seemed to rethink and dilute his optimism, \" I don't want to raise expectations (beyond) reality, but I think there are things we could do.\"",
