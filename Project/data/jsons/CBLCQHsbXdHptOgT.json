    "content": "Donald Trump , Jr. cruised into the Thanksgiving weekend on the heels of an enormous literary triumph . His opus Triggered had spent two solid weeks on the top of The New York Times non-fiction best seller list . Junior \u2019 s run ended this week when he was knocked off by A Warning . But despite this displacement , Triggered represents a triumph for the young scribe , who has now accomplished something on his own . His father \u2019 s namesake is , finally , not a failson .\nWhat \u2019 s a failson ( pronounced exactly like it looks , just a combination of \u201c fail \u201d and \u201c son \u201d ) ? He is an upper- ( or upper-middle ) class incompetent who is protected by familial wealth from the consequences of his actions . The term seems to have been coined by one Will Menaker of the podcast Chapo Trap House , as documented in The New Yorker in this 2016 article .\nOne is not born a failson . Nor does one simply inherit the status of failson . No\u2014failson status is earned through a display of equal parts incompetence , stupidity , and arrogance . And until his book , no person in America\u2014or maybe even the world , so bursting at the seams with louche heirs and dissolute royals with no throne to sit their pampered arses on\u2014illustrated all the facets of a failson better than Junior .\nBut wait ! Those pesky Federal Election Commission disclosers show that the Republican National Committee spent $ 94,000 on copies of Junior \u2019 s literary debut . The New York Times \u2019 Nick Confessore notes that \u201c new FEC disclosures show a single large RNC payment of $ 94,800 to Books-a-Million in October , a few days before Triggered was released . An RNC spokesman confirmed that the expenditure was connected to their promotion of Don Trump Jr. 's book . \u201d\nSo this means that junior is actually still a failson . In fact , one might say there is no greater expression of failson-ness than needing Daddy \u2019 s party \u2019 s political arm to bulk-buy your book .\nThe New York Times denotes such bulk sales with an asterisk to let readers know that the sales were not organic . Junior , never one to be deterred by facts , immediately declared that this was part of a larger Times conspiracy against him . \u201c I guess that \u2019 s their way of exerting a little bit of revenge by putting an asterisk without getting into the details , \u201d he sniffed . Yes Junior , The New York Times bulk purchasing policy is actually a conspiracy against you , the president \u2019 s large adult failson .\nAnother interesting failson protection that Junior enjoys is a free pass on all his alleged crimes . He was deemed in essence too stupid to collude by Robert Mueller . Harry Sandick , a former federal prosecutor , told Bloomberg News , \u201c For a willful violation , you must know that what you are doing violates some known legal duty. \u201d Since Junior didn \u2019 t understand the law , he was given a pass on knowingly breaking it .\nBut Junior is not alone in his failson status . Never in American history have we had an administration so chockablock full of failsons . The Trump administration boasts a panoply of failsons unrivaled since the days of King George .\nJared Kushner is the failson in chief , arguably worse than Junior . After crushing a newspaper and overpaying for the aptly named 666 Fifth Avenue , the failson-in-law decided to take a crack at governmenting . He was tasked with peace in the Middle East and also renegotiating NAFTA , handling the opioid crisis , modernizing the Veterans Administration , spearheading criminal justice reform , and WhatsApp messaging with Saudi Arabian failson Mohammed bin Salman .\nBut when those things proved too complicated for the young polymath , his father-in-law decided to refocus him on the important things , like why Matt Drudge was mad at him , tasking Ivanka \u2019 s husband to \u201c look into it \u201d and find out why Drudge has forsaken him . More recently , Jared was asked by his father-in-law to take another crack at building the wall .\nBut Jared is just one of many White House failsons . Eric Trump is , of course , another . Not as notorious as his dimwitted siblings , Eric is the one of the Trump litter who seems the most interested in running the family \u2019 s mediocre hotel business . Though Eric always enjoys doing a segment on Fox News , where he dishes out really hot takes like his assessment that \u201c Democrats weren \u2019 t even people. \u201d Eric is also extremely bad at Twitter . On Thanksgiving Day , he tweeted a picture of a red hat emblazoned with the acronym LOPA for \u201c Leave Our President Alone , \u201d which caused the internet to erupt in mockery of the young Hapsburg .\nFinally , the president \u2019 s free lawyer has a failson , Andrew , who works for the administration earning $ 90,000 a year . His chief responsibility seem to be largely \u201c having a nice time. \u201d But lest you think this is a nepotism hire , Rudy assured The Atlantic \u2019 s Elaina Plott , \u201c Now , did he know him in the first place because he was the mayor \u2019 s son ? Sure , but they also had a relationship independent of me. \u201d That relationship , according to a source who knows about it , includes many rounds of golf over the years .
