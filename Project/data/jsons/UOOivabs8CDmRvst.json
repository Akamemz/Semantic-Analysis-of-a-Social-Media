''\nKavanaugh \u2019 s nomination was embroiled in a controversy that gripped the nation after multiple women made sexual assault allegations originating from his time in high school and college . The most prominent allegation was from California professor Christine Blasey Ford , who said that Kavanaugh assaulted her at a high school party . That allegation resulted in a high-stakes Senate Judiciary hearing last week where both Ford and Kavanaugh testified .\nDemocrats said the allegations were credible and deserved a full investigation , while Republicans accused Democrats of using uncorroborated allegations to scuttle or delay the nomination -- leading to a stream of angry flashpoints between lawmakers .

Sen. Orrin Hatch , R-Utah , told protesters chasing him to \u201c grow up \u201d while Sen.

''\n`` The ideals of justice that have served our nation for so long are on display , '' he said , calling the last two weeks a `` disgraceful spectacle . ''\nBut Democrats had pointed to not only the sexual assault allegations , which they described \u201d but also questions about Kavanaugh \u2019 s temperament during the hearing last week and whether he had lied about his drinking during high school and college , and what certain references in his high school yearbook meant . They also sought to paint him as a justice that would swing the court deeply to the right .\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-NY , accused him of being evasive in his answers during his confirmation hearings on key topics .
