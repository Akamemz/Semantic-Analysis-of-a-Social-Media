Experts in Italy urged intensified efforts to identify new victims and trace their contacts . And France , which hasn \u2019 t yet eased its lockdown , has already worked up a \u201c reconfinement plan \u201d in the event of a new wave .\n\u201c There will be a second wave , but the problem is to which extent . Is it a small wave or a big wave ? It \u2019 s too early to say , \u201d said Olivier Schwartz , head of the virus unit at France \u2019 s Pasteur Institute .\nIn the U.S. , with about half of the states easing their shutdowns to get their economies restarted and cellphone data showing that people are becoming restless and increasingly leaving home , public health authorities are worried .\nMany states have not put in place the robust testing that experts believe is necessary to detect and contain new outbreaks . And many governors have pressed ahead before their states met one of the key benchmarks in the Trump administration \u2019 s guidelines for reopening -- a 14-day downward trajectory in new illnesses and infections .\n\u201c If we relax these measures without having the proper public health safeguards in place , we can expect many more cases and , unfortunately , more deaths , \u201d said Josh Michaud , associate director of global health policy with the Kaiser Family Foundation in Washington .\nCases have continued to rise steadily in places such as Iowa and Missouri since the governors began reopening , while new infections have yo-yoed in Georgia , Tennessee and Texas .\nLipkin said he is most worried about two things : the reopening of bars , where people crowd together and lose their inhibitions , and large gatherings such as sporting events , concerts and plays .

We risk complacency and accepting the preventable deaths of 2,000 Americans each day , \u201d epidemiologist Caitlin Rivers , a professor at Johns Hopkins , told a House subcommittee in Washington .\nPresident Donald Trump , who has pressed hard to ease the restrictions that have throttled the economy and thrown more than 30 million Americans out of work , pulled back Wednesday on White House plans revealed a day earlier to wind down the coronavirus task force .\nHe tweeted that the task force will continue meeting indefinitely with a \u201c focus on SAFETY & OPENING UP OUR COUNTRY AGAIN . \u201d\nUnderscoring those economic concerns , the European Union predicted the worst recession in its quarter-century history .
