Biden and his campaign have adamantly denied Reade \u2019 s accusations .\nFord \u2019 s accusation against Kavanaugh , which earned support from virtually every high-profile Democrat , lacked that level of corroboration . There \u2019 s no evidence that Ford and Kavanaugh ever met in high school \u2014 the time of the alleged assault \u2014 and her primary corroborating witness , Leland Keyser , ultimately said she didn \u2019 t have confidence in Ford \u2019 s account .\nOther than Keyser \u2019 s account , the biggest piece of corroborating evidence Ford had against Kavanaugh was the result of discussions nearly 30 years after the alleged assault was said to have taken place .\nNotes from therapy sessions Ford and her husband had in 2012 and 2013 show that she discussed an alleged high school assault , though she didn \u2019 t name the alleged perpetrator .
