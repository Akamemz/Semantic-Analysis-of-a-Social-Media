Even if they do, the issues of police violence and civil unrest are likely to be at the center of the upcoming presidential election, which is less than five months away.\n\nThe two candidates have taken drastically different approaches in their responses to the protests. President Trump has repeatedly called on authorities to \u201cdominate\u201d demonstrators, going so far as to suggest invoking his authority to deploy the U.S. military in American cities. \u201cI am your president of law and order,\u201d Trump said in an address last week before leaving the White House to walk to a nearby church in an area that had recently been cleared of peaceful protesters by police and the National Guard.\n\nPresumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden has attempted to strike a more unifying tone, while speaking out about the need to address \u201csystemic racism\u201d in the country.
