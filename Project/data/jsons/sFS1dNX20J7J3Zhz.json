As the turkey was carved , they shared thoughts of their families .\n`` I wish I could be home with my family and friends , but , I mean , I am surrounded by nothing but awesome people , so it is good , '' U.S. soldier Vanessa Gann said .\nIn Kabul , soldiers and service members with the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) sang carols and lit candles during a service on Christmas Eve at the U.S.-led coalition base .\nFor some soldiers , this is hardly the first Christmas away from home . But it should be one of the last in Kabul , with NATO forces expected to mostly withdraw by 2014 . The U.S. and allied nations are trying to turn over the country to Afghan-led security forces .\nMore On This ... Holiday revelers celebrate Christmas around the world\nAs troops rung in the holiday , and soon the new year , Christians from around the world flocked to Manger Square in Bethlehem on Tuesday to celebrate the birth of Jesus in the ancient West Bank town where he was born .\nOthers traveled to Vatican City , where Pope Benedict XVI delivered his traditional `` Urbi et Orbi '' speech -- Latin for `` to the city and the world '' -- from the central balcony of St. Peter 's Basilica to thousands of pilgrims , tourists and Romans gathered in the piazza below .\nBenedict wished Christmas peace to the world , decrying the slaughter of the `` defenseless '' in Syria and urging Israelis and Palestinians to find the courage to negotiate .\nHe also encouraged Arab spring nations , especially Egypt , to build just and respectful societies and prayed that China 's new leaders respect religion , a reference to persecution Chinese Roman Catholics have at times endured under communism .\nOvercast skies and a cold wind did n't dampen the spirits of worshippers who came dressed in holiday finery and the traditional attire of foreign lands to mark the holy day in this biblical West Bank town . Bells pealed and long lines formed inside the fourth-century Church of the Nativity complex as Christian faithful waited eagerly to see the grotto that is Jesus ' traditional birthplace .\nThe cavernous church was unable to hold all the worshippers who had hoped to celebrate Christmas Day Mass inside . A loudspeaker outside the church broadcast the service to the hundreds in the square who could not pack inside .\nTourists in the square posed for pictures as vendors hawked olive wood rosaries , nativity scenes , corn on the cob , roasted nuts , tea and coffee .\nAn official from the Palestinian tourism ministry predicted 10,000 foreigners would visit Bethlehem on Christmas Day and said 15,000 visited on Christmas Eve -- up 20 percent from a year earlier . The official , Rula Maia ' a , attributed the rise in part to the Church of the Nativity 's classification earlier this year as a U.N. World Heritage Site .\nOn Christmas Eve , the pope presided over Mass in St. Peter 's Basilica . The service began at 10 p.m. local time , or 4 p.m . ET . The midnight start time was changed at the Vatican years ago to let the pontiff rest before a Christmas Day speech to be delivered from the basilica 's central balcony .\nIn his homily , Benedict cited the Gospel account of Mary and Joseph finding no room at an inn and ending up in a stable which sheltered the baby Jesus . He urged people to reflect upon what they find time for in their busy , technology-driven lives .\n`` The great moral question of our attitude toward the homeless , toward refugees and migrants takes on a deeper dimension : Do we really have room for God when he seeks to enter under our roof ? Do we have time and space for him ? '' the pope said .\n`` The faster we can move , the more efficient our time-saving appliances become , the less time we have . And God ? The question of God never seems urgent , '' Benedict lamented .\nThe pope worried that `` we are so 'full ' of ourselves that there is no room left for God . '' He added , `` that means there is no room for others either -- for children , for the poor , for the stranger . ''\nThe pontiff also prayed that Israelis and Palestinians live in peace and freedom , and asked the faithful to pray for strife-torn Syria as well as Lebanon and Iraq .\nIn Bethlehem , the Palestinian hosts were hopeful after a recent vote in favor of statehood in the United Nations , though the vote did little to bring them closer to independence .\nIn his annual pre-Christmas homily , the top Roman Catholic cleric in the Holy Land , Latin Patriarch Fouad Twal , said this year 's festivities were doubly joyful .\n`` The path ( to statehood ) remains long , and will require a united effort , '' said Twal , a Palestinian citizen of Jordan , at the patriarchate 's headquarters in Jerusalem 's Old City .\nThen he set off in a procession for the West Bank city of Bethlehem , Jesus ' traditional birthplace . Twal had to enter the biblical town through a massive metal gate in the barrier of towering concrete slabs Israel built between Jerusalem and Bethlehem during a wave of Palestinian suicide bombings in the last decade . The Israeli military , which controls the crossing , said it significantly eased restrictions for the Christmas season .\nIsrael , backed by the United States , opposed the statehood bid , saying it was a Palestinian ploy to bypass negotiations . Talks stalled four years ago .\nHundreds of people greeted Twal in Manger Square , outside the Church of Nativity . The mood was festive under sunny skies , with children dressed in holiday finery or in Santa costumes , and marching bands playing in the streets .\nAfter nightfall on Monday , a packed Manger Square , resplendent with strings of lights , decorations and a 17-meter Christmas tree , took on a festival atmosphere .\nA choral group from the Baptist Church in Jerusalem performed carols on one side of the square , handing out sheets of lyrics and encouraging others to sing along with songs such as `` We Wish You A Merry Christmas . ''\nFestivities led up to the Midnight Mass at St. Catherine 's Church , next to the fourth-century Church of the Nativity , built over the grotto where tradition says Jesus was born .\nAudra Kasparian , 45 , from Salt Lake City , Utah , called her visit to Bethlehem `` a life event to cherish forever . It is one of those events that is great to be a part of . ''\nChristmas is the high point of the year in Bethlehem , which , like the rest of the West Bank , is struggling to recover from the economic hard times that followed the violent Palestinian uprising against Israel that broke out in late 2000 .\nTourists and pilgrims who were scared away by the fighting have been returning in larger numbers . Last year 's Christmas Eve celebration produced the highest turnout in more than a decade , with some 100,000 visitors , including foreign workers and Arab Christians from Israel .\nThe Israeli Tourism Ministry predicted a 25 percent drop from that level this year , following last month 's clash between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza , which put a chill on tourist arrivals . Foreign tourists heading to Bethlehem must pass through Israel or the Israel-controlled border crossing into the West Bank from Jordan .\nOutside the town 's quaint Manger Square , Bethlehem is a drab , sprawling town with a dwindling Christian base .\nOverall , there are only about 50,000 Christians in the West Bank , less than 3 percent of the population , the result of a lower birthrate and increased emigration . Bethlehem 's Christians make up only a third of the town 's residents , down from 75 percent a few decades ago .\nElias Joha , a 44-year-old Christian who runs a souvenir store , said even with the U.N. recognition , this year 's celebrations were sad for him .

Many Muslims took part in celebration Monday as well .\nIn Iraq , Christians gathered for services with tight security , including at Baghdad 's Our Lady of Salvation church , the scene of a brutal October 2010 attack that killed more than 50 worshippers and wounded scores more .\nEarlier this month , Cardinal Leonardo Sandri , who is responsible for the Vatican 's outreach to the Middle East 's Catholic communities , traveled to Iraq and presided over a Mass to rededicate the church following renovations . In his homily , he remembered those who were killed and expressed hope that `` the tears shed in this sacred place become the good seed of communion and witness and bear much fruit , '' according to an account by Vatican Radio .\nThe exact number of Christians remaining in Iraq is not known , but it has fallen sharply from as many as 1.4 million before the U.S.-led invasion nearly a decade ago to about 400,000 to 600,000 , according community leaders cited by the U.S. State Department .",
