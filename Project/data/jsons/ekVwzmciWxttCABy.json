Awful in terms of the sheer number of dead , but also awful in terms of the reluctance from the very beginning to deliver an accurate death count . That the disaster turned out to be deadlier even than Hurricane Katrina is shocking , and the fact that it took the government until this week to finally acknowledge that fact is an entirely separate shock .\nAnd it \u2019 s a reminder that while Trump \u2019 s time in office has shown that the macroeconomy can remain remarkably robust in the face of a president who has no idea what he \u2019 s doing , there are other aspects of national affairs where this is not the case .\nTrump is a president who can \u2019 t even properly execute a relatively simple presidential task like leading the national mourning for the late Sen. John McCain in an appropriate way . Faced with something genuinely difficult like a strong hurricane hitting an island whose electrical infrastructure was already in rocky shape , he just totally failed with catastrophic consequences .\nTrump \u2019 s instinct from Day 1 has been to simply turn the island \u2019 s devastation into another front in culture-war politics , a strategy that has helped keep his political career alive despite his lack of substantive command of the job .\nThe rest of us just have to pray for good luck .\nThat Trump spends an almost inhuman amount of time watching cable television is something we now all take for granted as part of the background noise of our lives . What \u2019 s often forgotten is the role that Trump \u2019 s preference for television over proper briefings played in creating the crisis .\nBut back in 2017 , Hurricanes Harvey and Irma were massive cable television events that dominated coverage on all the networks . Hurricane Maria , by contrast , was relatively invisible on cable , according to reporting from Dhrumil Mehta at FiveThirtyEight .\n\u201c People on TV news shows spoke significantly fewer sentences about Hurricane Maria than about Hurricanes Harvey and Irma , \u201d he writes , and \u201c the spike in conversation about Puerto Rico right as the hurricane hit was also much smaller than the spike in mentions of Texas and Florida . \u201d\nCable producers surely had their reasons for this . But something anyone in the media could tell you is that cable producers \u2019 news judgment is not an infallible guide to the substantive importance of various stories . In particular , a broad range of issues \u2014 potentially including natural disasters in outlying US territories \u2014 have an asymmetrical quality to them . If handled appropriately , most people won \u2019 t care that much ; but if botched , it eventually becomes a big deal .\nThis is why presidents have traditionally relied upon staff and the massive information-gathering capabilities of the American government for information rather than letting television set the agenda . Trump has a different philosophy , however , and spent the post-storm Saturday glued to his television and letting the hosts of Fox & Friends drag him into an ill-advised Twitter spat with NBA star Steph Curry and various NFL players .\n`` Fox & Friends '' covered this story at 8:24am .

Since most Americans are white \u2014 and since white people are overrepresented among voters , and white voters are further overrepresented in the congressional map \u2014 this political argument over racism arguably helps Trump politically , and thus solved the political downside to having botched the response to a huge disaster .\nNow , nearly a year later , Trump just insists that everything is fine , as if the sheer force of denial can make problems go away .\nIn the intervening months , we \u2019 ve seen the botched implementation of the cruel family separation policy , a tariff war with China that has no clear goals , a weird international crisis related to Montenegro \u2019 s NATO membership , an inability to get the White House flags flown at half-staff to recognize the death of a war hero senator , and dozens of other examples of an administration that simply isn \u2019 t up to doing the job it was hired to do .\nTo a perhaps surprising extent , it turns out that the basic machinery of the American government continues to more or less function under these circumstances , and with some reasonable people tapped to run the Federal Reserve , the national economy manages to keep chugging along nicely as well .\nBut things happen in life \u2014 sometimes very bad things \u2014 that test a president \u2019 s mettle , and we saw in Puerto Rico that Trump isn \u2019 t up to the test .
