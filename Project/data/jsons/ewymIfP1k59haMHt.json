''\n`` That 's why 98 percent of humanity have said we do n't use these .

''\nWhen asked by PBS about Syrian President Bashar al-Assad 's claim that the U.S. is lying about his use of chemical weapons , Obama said there can be no diplomatic solution if the Syrian president keeps make statements that are `` untrue . ''\n`` I think that if we can come up with a mechanism to get these under control , verify and enforce that they are not being used , then we should do everything we can to pursue that , '' Obama said . `` But ... that 's not going to happen if Assad thinks that he can lie his way through this and eventually the world forgets the images of those children who were gassed . ''\nObama also sought to tamp down the specter of a threat from Assad for the United States to `` expect every action '' in retaliation for potential military strikes in Syria .\n`` Mr. Assad does n't have a lot of capability . He has capability relative to children , he has capability relative to an opposition that is still getting itself organized and are not professional trained fighters , '' Obama said . `` He does n't have a credible means to threaten the United States . ''\nHowever , Obama said it was possible for Iran and Hezbollah to launch `` asymmetrical strikes , '' but dismissed them as nothing more than `` the kinds of threats that we are dealing with around the world . ''\nHe told NBC that he had yet to decide how he would proceed if Congress voted against authorizing force .\nIn light of the upcoming anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks , Obama said the date brings heightened security , but he cautioned that `` we 're not going to be able to protect ourselves 100 percent of the time against every threat '' and that the key was to be prepared without over-reacting .",
