    "content": "The fight against COVID-19 is being waged on many fronts . Mr. Mignosa is fighting to keep his community and his workforce whole . His day is a window into what that looks like in an American town in a pandemic .\nBut these are not normal times , not when shoppers are panic-buying , employees are calling in sick , and suppliers are struggling to keep up . \u201c Will our food keep showing up ? \u201d the customers ask him , politely , from a safe distance .\nMr. Mignosa likes to know his customers , his competitors , and just about everything about the grocery business . He \u2019 s in constant motion on the shop floor and in the storeroom , working long days . In normal times , that workload keeps him busy .\nMaybe you have a local store , not a national chain , where you buy some , if not all , of your groceries . You probably know some of the staff by now , perhaps the store manager too , if he \u2019 s anything like Mark Mignosa , who runs a bustling grocery south of Boston .\nThe grocer gets up at 5 a.m. , and washes his hands .\nIn the dark he dresses , eats something , tries \u201c to clear [ his ] mind , \u201d and opens his email . He begins .\nOn another day , in other times , this is when he would have looked at numbers \u2013 order sizes maybe , sales by hour , prior-year traffic . He would have been planning , imagining innovations , thinking hard about customer demands and employee needs and competitor strategies . He would have been thinking hard about how he might make his store better , as he loves to do .\nThe grocer \u2019 s name is Mark Mignosa . And right now his grocery store \u2013 Fruit Center Marketplace , in Hingham , Massachusetts \u2013 could be almost any grocery store in locked-down America , and his story almost any grocer \u2019 s story . Except that his store isn \u2019 t any store .\nAnd like anybody , I need it to keep getting me food .\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Mark Mignosa , co-owner and president of the Fruit Center Marketplace , an independently owned grocery store , poses in front of the fully stocked produce aisle in his store on March 25 , 2020 , in Hingham , Massachusetts . Grocery stores are considered essential businesses during the coronavirus crisis .\nBy 6:30 a.m. , after the emailing from home about health department updates , tactical questions from managers , and the day \u2019 s \u201c directives \u201d ( \u201c Even more handwashing ! \u201d ) , he \u2019 s in the Fruit Center \u2019 s aisles . \u201c And from the moment you hit the store , you \u2019 re on , \u201d he says . The doors will open at 7 , instead of 8 , for a newly added hour restricted to \u201c 60-and-over \u201d shoppers , and away the day will race .\nAgenda : Get enough goods on the emptying shelves , keep customers safe and calm , keep employees healthy and committed , and keep himself from getting sick . Ready , set , go .\nMr. Mignosa knows what I \u2019 m thinking , because he knows everybody \u2019 s thinking it . Will our food keep showing up ?\nSometime in the past few weeks , as coronavirus cases and social lockdowns spread , Mr. Mignosa watched Americans decide they could no longer trust groceries to be available when they needed them . Hence the hoarding . Almost half the stores responding to a national Progressive Grocer poll likened their customers to frantic prospectors in a river running out of gold . The Fruit Center was no exception ; foot traffic rose between 100 % and 200 % , and average checkout tallies doubled . Business still remains at \u201c holiday levels , \u201d says Mr. Mignosa , which is hard to manage in the best of times , and brutally hard when the \u201c holiday \u201d refuses to end .\nOf course his customers , like shoppers everywhere , have questions : How can we expect the food system to keep working when it seems like most people don \u2019 t go to work ? Will we ever actually see toilet paper again ?\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Customers shop at the Fruit Center Marketplace during the coronavirus crisis , on March 25 , 2020 , in Hingham , Massachusetts . The store is limiting the number of people allowed inside at one time to allow for social distancing .\nAccording to supply chain analysts and grocery industry insiders \u2013 as well as Mr. Mignosa \u2019 s own instincts and experience \u2013 the answers are easy :\nYes , there will be toilet paper ; in fact there were a few rolls yesterday . ( \u201c Fred found some from an industrial paper distributor . The crew we have , they \u2019 re veterans . They can find things. \u201d ) It sold out . More \u2019 s coming .\nAnd yes , the U.S. food supply chain will keep getting us food . Just not everything we \u2019 re used to .\nThe Fruit Center and its sister location in nearby Milton \u2013 both co-owned and co-managed by Mr. Mignosa and his brother , Michael \u2013 are about half the size of average supermarkets but still need deliveries from 30 distributors and some 200 vendors . Supply isn \u2019 t perfect , Mr. Mignosa says . \u201c But honestly , I \u2019 m impressed by the product flow . \u201d\nThe morning goes both fast and slow . Fast because of so much work , \u201c and with very short staff . We \u2019 re down a few people in every department. \u201d Employees have begged off due to illness , or discomfort with the exposure , or the need to care for others at home . ( \u201c Which is absolutely understandable , and what you expect , \u201d Mr. Mignosa says . \u201c We need people to do what \u2019 s right for them . \u201d )\nSlow because it \u2019 s just a few weeks since the national emergency declaration and already you can see the accumulating weariness among the staff \u2013 the wish for the days to hurry up and the bad dream to be over . Massachusetts is among the worst-hit states so far , with more than 5,700 confirmed cases of COVID-19 .\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Liam Carey stocks produce at the Fruit Center Marketplace during the coronavirus crisis , on March 25 , 2020 , in Hingham , Massachusetts . He says he is happy to still have a job .\nIn the store , Mr. Mignosa likes to move \u2013 constantly circulating with short quick steps . When he stops to talk , his torso tilts forward a little , as though to catch any words that might fall between you . He \u2019 s the kind of boss who wears the same outfit the clerks and stockers do . If there \u2019 s a sudden need for baggers at the checkout , he \u2019 s the kind of boss who bags .\nBefore all this , says Mr. Mignosa , \u201c everything about our days was completely different . The whole focus would have been customer service , quality , freshness , the personal development '' of employees . ( The Fruit Center has 300 . )\nThen there \u2019 s the scramble to keep up with orders and find new sources of must-have items . Cleaning goods and paper products remain hard to get , along with backroom store supplies like bathroom soaps and sanitizers , and sometimes deli meats and water , \u201c like before a storm. \u201d The other day there wasn \u2019 t any canola oil or dried black beans . \u201c A lot of comfort food is going on , \u201d Mr. Mignosa says .\nMeanwhile , the store \u2019 s processes and tactics are changed almost daily . The salad bar is closed . The soup table is closed . To facilitate safe social distancing , the store is metered now ; 50 or 60 shoppers are allowed in ; after that it 's one in , one out . Plastic glass barriers have been erected at checkouts , and hourly wages have been hiked $ 2 ( as has become increasingly common industrywide ) . In front of the fish counter and deli counter and checkout stations , there \u2019 s blue tape on the floor to keep people at a distance . There are signs up .\nBy lunchtime Mr. Mignosa has no idea how many times he has washed his hands . Nor how many conversations he has had \u2013 with staffers , with customers . \u201c All centered on the same issue. \u201d Sometimes it feels like the conversations are all he does .\n\u201c We \u2019 re all a little frightened , because we \u2019 re all on the front line . I don \u2019 t even want to say that because I don \u2019 t want to scare anybody , but it \u2019 s the truth. \u201d In Italy , an infected grocery clerk has died ; the news reports are everywhere .\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Signs at the Rocky Neck Fish counter instruct customers to stay behind a line at the Fruit Center Marketplace during the coronavirus crisis , on March 25 , 2020 , in Hingham , Massachusetts .\nSo he circulates and he talks . \u201c It \u2019 s the time you have with every individual that matters . They need it , they \u2019 re sacrificing so much , they \u2019 re such pros , \u201d says Mr. Mignosa . He tries to reach everybody . \u201c Could be three minutes , 10 minutes . Could be a couple people , could be one at a time . \u201d\nCustomers , too , seem hungry to talk . All day they ask Mr. Mignosa and his Fruit Center colleagues , \u201c How are you ? You guys doing OK ? \u201d The questions are repeated so often that one might imagine they grow stale when there \u2019 s so much work to do . \u201c No ! \u201d Mr. Mignosa says . \u201c No , no , we need people to ask us that . We need to ask them how they \u2019 re doing , too . With customers there \u2019 s more of a connection now than ever \u2013 because we \u2019 re all going through this together . It helps everyone .\nAfternoon . Mr. Mignosa is in the parking lot , where there are too many cars . He \u2019 s traffic-copping , smiling \u2013 directing people in his simultaneously decisive and self-effacing way .\nOutside the main door , shoppers are lined up in the manner we \u2019 ve all now learned \u2013 spread out like fence posts that got abandoned before the actual fencing went up .\nI recognize some of them by sight if not name ; 20 years of patronage among others just as loyal will do that . They seem calm . I ask them how they \u2019 re doing .\nOne couple \u2013 Christine and Alden \u2013 tell me , \u201c This is nice. \u201d Nice ?\n\u201c Yeah , I feel better here , \u201d explains Christine . \u201c I mean this is our store . At home , the news \u2013 it can seem like nothing is working . Anywhere . And the isolation ... \u201d She looks around ; the sky is gray but it \u2019 s not too cold .\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Customers leave with their purchases from the Fruit Center Marketplace .\n\u201c Well , normal-ish , \u201d Alden revises . He changes the subject . \u201c I seriously want to thank these guys for their service . Is that weird ? \u201d I say I know what he means .\nInside the store a fully masked customer at the checkout waves his arm to indicate his filled cart and gives me a muffled , \u201c This is great , \u201d the skin around his eyes crinkling with a smile you can \u2019 t see . Meanwhile people keep floating slowly through the aisles , nodding to one another as they calculate just what 6 feet looks like . There \u2019 s still no toilet paper . \u201c Or flour or chicken stock , \u201d Mr. Mignosa says . It troubles him .\nIt isn \u2019 t normal , though . The shelves may look serene but the duck \u2019 s feet are windmilling frantically below the surface , just as they are behind the scenes at other supermarkets and food distributors and loading docks across the country . Mr. Mignosa can \u2019 t get his staff to leave on time . \u201c It \u2019 s overwhelming , the amount of load coming in [ for restocking ] , \u201d he tells me . The store closes at 6 p.m. instead of its previous 8 p.m. to allocate hours for sanitizing and stock handling , but there \u2019 s still not enough time to get the work done , \u201c and they don \u2019 t wan na leave . \u201d\nMr. Mignosa adds , \u201c I keep insisting it \u2019 s important to leave . You have to get rest . You have to take care of yourselves . \u201d\nSometime between 5:30 and 6 p.m. , he goes home . He has been at the store for 11 hours .\nMaybe you feel about some store that \u2019 s local to you the way I feel about the Fruit Center . Especially now .\nOn occasion over the past two decades I feared for it , as a Whole Foods and a Trader Joe \u2019 s and a Fresh Market came to town ( joining two other supermarkets already here ) . But the Fruit Center just kept getting better , and thrived . It \u2019 s the kind of store where if you ask a stocker for the location of the capers , he doesn \u2019 t tell you or point ; he drops what he \u2019 s doing and takes you to them , no matter how many aisles away .\nThe store is good , is the thing . Flagrantly competent , delightful to be in , easy to count on . You can count on it without even thinking about it . You can take it for granted .\nOver the phone , I tell Mr. Mignosa about the customers who wanted to thank him and his people for their service , and I hear him exhale .\n\u201c You know , \u201d he says , \u201c we get a lot of that now . Seems ridiculous but I almost feel like a first responder , or a fireman , whatever . It \u2019 s not like we \u2019 re depended on for survival or anything . \u201d\nYet you kind of are , I remind him , because : food .\n\u201c People are so grateful . It keeps you going . And when we get that support , in an email or a conversation , we immediately try to blast it around the store to everyone . It \u2019 s like : This is it . This is why . We can do this . \u201d\nAnd of course , I know they can . I know they will . It \u2019 s a grocery store , but right about now it feels a little heroic .\nMr. Mignosa is home for the night , his phone on ( \u201c always \u201d ) but his computer off . He and his wife have three kids \u2013 two in college and a high school freshman \u2013 and now the whole family is back together in the lockdown . \u201c My family \u2019 s great ; they \u2019 re very balanced , \u201d he says , his voice making it sound as though \u201c balanced \u201d might be the hardest and most precious thing in the world . \u201c It \u2019 s a good reset for me . \u201d\nSo , he resets . Does he worry about how long he and his crew can keep going ? \u201c No . I \u2019 m just not at that point ; I don \u2019 t think about that . Nothing past tomorrow matters .\n\u201c There \u2019 s no doubt that we can keep this going for our community . \u201d\nSo tomorrow , like today , he \u2019 ll do the best thing he can think to do , which is to do his job as well as he can do it .\nBut first , he needs some rest . So he \u2019 ll go to bed .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox . By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy",

Mr. Mignosa can\u2019t get his staff to leave on time. \u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming, the amount of load coming in [for restocking],\u201d he tells me. The store closes at 6 p.m. instead of its previous 8 p.m. to allocate hours for sanitizing and stock handling, but there\u2019s still not enough time to get the work done, \u201cand they don\u2019t wanna leave.\u201d\n\nMr. Mignosa adds, \u201cI keep insisting it\u2019s important to leave. You have to get rest. You have to take care of yourselves.\u201d\n\nDoes Mr. Mignosa take his own advice?\n\nSometime between 5:30 and 6 p.m., he goes home.

It\u2019s the kind of store where if you ask a stocker for the location of the capers, he doesn\u2019t tell you or point; he drops what he\u2019s doing and takes you to them, no matter how many aisles away.\n\nThe store is good, is the thing. Flagrantly competent, delightful to be in, easy to count on. You can count on it without even thinking about it. You can take it for granted.\n\nOver the phone, I tell Mr. Mignosa about the customers who wanted to thank him and his people for their service, and I hear him exhale.\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d he says, \u201cwe get a lot of that now. Seems ridiculous but I almost feel like a first responder, or a fireman, whatever. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re depended on for survival or anything.\u201d\n\nYet you kind of are, I remind him, because: food.\n\n\u201cPeople are so grateful. It keeps you going. And when we get that support, in an email or a conversation, we immediately try to blast it around the store to everyone. It\u2019s like: This is it. This is why. We can do this.\u201d\n\nAnd of course, I know they can. I know they will. It\u2019s a grocery store, but right about now it feels a little heroic.\n\nMr. Mignosa is home for the night, his phone on (\u201calways\u201d) but his computer off. He and his wife have three kids \u2013 two in college and a high school freshman \u2013 and now the whole family is back together in the lockdown. \u201cMy family\u2019s great; they\u2019re very balanced,\u201d he says, his voice making it sound as though \u201cbalanced\u201d might be the hardest and most precious thing in the world. \u201cIt\u2019s a good reset for me.\u201d\n\nSo, he resets. Does he worry about how long he and his crew can keep going? \u201cNo. I\u2019m just not at that point; I don\u2019t think about that. Nothing past tomorrow matters.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that we can keep this going for our community.\u201d\n\nSo tomorrow, like today, he\u2019ll do the best thing he can think to do, which is to do his job as well as he can do it.\n\nBut first, he needs some rest. So he\u2019ll go to bed.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.
