    "content_original": "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nLeading up to the Brexit vote, I, like so many others, was sure Britain would vote to remain in the European Union. I was certain the endless pummeling by experts, the endless fear-mongering, would all pay off like it did for the Scottish referendum.\n\nI was wrong, and happily so.\n\nThe Leave campaign received 52 percent of the vote, while Remain garnered 48 percent. The UK has voted to leave the European Union.\n\nAnd you know what? Britons did the right thing.\n\nDemocracy is tricky. It relies on a proper balance between elite consensus and populist outcomes. You can't have a direct democracy, and the majority of people is not a body qualified enough to make most decisions that a government makes. That's why you need a ruling elite.\n\nMost of the time, this ruling elite is a good thing. But sometimes a ruling elite can go bad. It can close in on itself. It can become ideological. It can grow its own set of values and mores distinct from those of the people it is supposed to serve. In that case, the elite and the people become adversaries.\n\nThis is the disease of democracies, and it had infected Britain.\n\nFor decades, British and European elites have stuck up their nose at the rest of the British people. The argument for Brexit was always an argument about national sovereignty expressed democratically through a parliament. The British people have fought for literally 800 years to get a sovereign parliament. They fought kings, they fought popes, they fought Hitler, all to have a sovereign parliament.\n\nThis kind of disease needs to be treated, because the longer it endures, the sicker a democracy becomes.
