    "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Former Vice President Joe Biden opened his presidential campaign Thursday by pointing to a \u201c battle for the soul of this nation , \u201d in what may be the last major addition to a sprawling lineup of Democratic candidates competing to challenge President Trump in 2020 .\nMr. Biden \u2019 s entry means the Democratic contest is largely set , putting the former vice president into a scramble for the nomination against a diverse field of candidates who have been competing and raising money for months . The contest already is revolving around who is most likely to unseat Mr. Trump , with primary voters debating how far left a winning nominee might go .\nMr. Biden made his long-awaited announcement in an online video , casting Mr. Trump \u2019 s comments praising \u201c both sides \u201d after the 2017 violence in Charlottesville , Va.\u2014where hundreds of white nationalists staged a protest against the planned removal of a Confederate statue that led to street fighting and left one woman dead\u2014as a national emergency that demanded a change in leadership .\n\u201c I believe history will look back on four years of this president and all he embraces as an aberrant moment in time , \u201d Mr. Biden said in the video , posted nearly 32 years after he began his first presidential campaign in June 1987 . \u201c But if we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House , he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation , who we are , and I can not stand by and watch that happen . \u201d\nAfter Mr. Biden \u2019 s announcement , Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter , \u201c Welcome to the race Sleepy Joe , \u201d and suggested he lacked the intelligence to win the primary .\nSpeaking with Fox News \u2019 Sean Hannity on Thursday night , Mr. Trump , referring to Mr. Biden \u2019 s comment about the country \u2019 s \u201c soul , \u201d said there had been \u201c tremendous division \u201d during the Obama administration and added : \u201c We actually have great spirit right now . \u201d\nMr. Biden enters the campaign with a reservoir of goodwill among Democrats after eight years as Mr. Obama \u2019 s vice president and 36 years of service as a U.S. senator from Delaware . Early polls have shown him as a leading contender for the nomination , helped by his broad name recognition .\nWho \u2019 s Running in 2020 The 2020 Democratic presidential primary is the party \u2019 s biggest and most diverse in modern history . Meet the candidates .\nMr. Biden nonetheless will face a number of hurdles at the start of his campaign . His Democratic rivals have had a head start on fundraising for several months . His centrist Democratic politics\u2014supportive of the Affordable Care Act and the Paris Agreement on climate change , for example\u2014may not sit well with some liberal activists in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire . These voters champion Medicare for All and the Green New Deal , a far-ranging effort to reshape the U.S. economy within 10 years to release net-zero carbon emissions .\nJustice Democrats , an advocacy group that backed Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York , said it would oppose Mr. Biden \u2019 s candidacy : \u201c The old guard of the Democratic Party failed to stop Trump , and they can \u2019 t be counted on to lead the fight against his divide-and-conquer politics today . \u201d\nIn recent weeks , Mr. Biden has faced allegations from seven women that he inappropriately touched them or made close contact . Mr. Biden , who is known for his tendency to touch people , didn \u2019 t apologize but said that he would be \u201c more mindful and respectful of people \u2019 s personal space . \u201d\nIf elected , Mr. Biden would be the oldest person to enter the White House . He is currently 76 years old , four years older than Mr. Trump and a year younger than Democratic rival Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont .\nOn his first day , Mr. Biden picked up endorsements from a handful of senators , including Sens . Tom Carper and Chris Coons from his home state of Delaware , Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Doug Jones of Alabama .\nHis supporters , meanwhile , sought to create a show of force in fundraising , mindful of Mr. Biden \u2019 s need for a strong start . \u201c There \u2019 s been a huge amount of activity , \u201d said Steve Westly , a former California state controller who is raising money for Mr. Biden \u2019 s campaign , though he provided no specifics . \u201c Fundamentally , people believe in Joe Biden , and fundamentally , people believe the United States is in a very serious position and they need someone experienced for the job . \u201d\nMr. Biden attended a private fundraiser in Philadelphia on Thursday that was organized by former Pennsylvania Gov . Ed Rendell and several longtime supporters .\nMr. Biden is chasing rivals who have made headway in fundraising , particularly among donors who give in small amounts : Mr. Sanders has taken an early lead , amassing more than $ 18 million during the quarter ended in late March , while Sen.
