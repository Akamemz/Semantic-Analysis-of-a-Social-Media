    "content": "Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson has emerged as a leading Republican presidential candidate in Iowa and is closing in on frontrunner Donald Trump in the state that hosts the first 2016 nomination balloting contest .\nThe latest Bloomberg Politics/Des Moines Register Iowa Poll shows billionaire Trump with the support of 23 percent of likely Republican caucus participants , followed by Carson at 18 percent . When first and second choices are combined , Carson is tied with Trump .\nTrump finds himself in a vastly better position than when the previous Iowa Poll was taken . He has become a credible presidential candidate to many likely Republican caucus-goers . The real estate mogul is rated favorably by 61 percent and unfavorably by 35 percent , an almost complete reversal since the Iowa Poll in May . He finds his highest ratings among those planning to attend the caucuses for the first time ( 69 percent ) and limited-government Tea Party activists ( 73 percent ) . Just 29 percent say they could never vote for him , a number cut in half since May .\nAlthough he is n't generating the headlines enjoyed by Trump , Carson has quietly built a dedicated network of supporters in Iowa . During the past month , he also aired more ads than any other presidential candidate in Iowa . Carson has the highest favorability rating among Republican candidates , with 79 percent of likely GOP caucus-goers seeing him positively .\nThose glowing views of Carson , who has a compelling life story and is seeking to become the nation 's second black president , could make it hard for Trump or other rivals to attack him as the campaign heats up this fall . Christian conservatives , who represent nearly 40 percent of likely caucus participants in the poll , may be starting to coalesce around the former director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins .\nThe poll displays the political benefit , at least for now , of not being part of the Republican establishment . When their totals are combined , Trump and Carson -- two men without any elected experience -- are backed by more than 4 in 10 likely caucus participants . Add in former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina , who also has never held elective office , and Texas Senator Ted Cruz , who is running an explicitly anti- establishment campaign , and the total reaches 54 percent of the likely electorate .\n`` Trump and Carson , one bombastic and the other sometimes soft-spoken , could hardly be more different in their outward presentations , '' said J. Ann Selzer , president of West Des Moines-based Selzer & Co. , which conducted the poll . `` Yet they 're both finding traction because they do n't seem like politicians and there 's a strong demand for that right now . ''\nWisconsin Governor Scott Walker , the previous Iowa frontrunner , has been hurt the most by the Trump and Carson summer surges and is now backed by just 8 percent of likely caucus-goers , less than half what he recorded in the last Iowa Poll in late May . Cruz , who will need to cut into Carson 's support among social conservatives if he 's to advance in Iowa , is tied with Walker at 8 percent .\nJeb Bush , who continues to face major headwinds in Iowa , scored below Walker and Cruz . The former Florida governor is backed by just 6 percent , has one of the highest unfavorable ratings among the 17 Republican candidates tested , and has the support of just 16 percent of those who consider themselves business-oriented establishment Republicans , the group most central to his brand .\nBush 's fellow Floridian , Senator Marco Rubio , is also backed by 6 percent . He 's closely followed by Fiorina , who is supported by 5 percent after her strong showing in the Aug. 6 debate .\nIn the 2008 and 2012 Republican caucuses , Christian conservatives broke late in the race and helped determine the outcome in Iowa . While some of their leaders have expressed skepticism about the potential to unify behind one candidate in such a crowded race , there 's an opening for that . More than three-quarters of Christian conservatives in the poll say they could be convinced to back someone other than their first or second choice , if they could be assured that another Christian conservative would win .\nAt the moment , Carson is leading with voters in that bloc at 23 percent , followed by Trump at 16 percent and Cruz and Walker tied at third . If his competitors can successfully raise questions about Trump 's credentials as a Christian conservative , they could potentially peel off some of the front-runner 's support .\nOne major unknown for the caucuses is the size of the electorate , which has been around 120,000 on the Republican side for the past two Iowa caucuses . One of Trump 's campaign goals is to get thousands of new people to vote , a move that helped Barack Obama score an upset on the Democratic side in 2008 .\nFirst-time caucus-goers are clearly an important part of Trump 's Iowa base . Among those who say they 'll be attending for the first time , Trump is ahead of Carson , 28 percent to 20 percent .\nFor now , the poll suggests about a fifth of those attending the Feb. 1 precinct meetings will be doing so for the first time . That 's comparable to four years ago , when 24 percent said that on the Republican side in an October 2011 Iowa Poll .\nTrump 's supporters in Iowa a have a higher level of trust in their candidate than others in the field to make the right decisions , if he makes it to the White House . Among all Republicans likely to attend the caucuses , 41 percent want their candidate to be clear about the specific policies they would address if elected , while 57 percent trust their candidate to figure it out once elected .\nFor Trump , nearly two-thirds of his supporters trust him to figure out the right decisions once in office . That 's in keeping with a claim he made to reporters Aug. 15 , shortly after landing by helicopter outside the Iowa State Fair , saying it 's mostly the media that cares about policy papers and positions .\nAmong most of the subgroups measured in the poll , Trump has the advantage , although Carson beats him or comes close with several . Carson has an 11-percentage-point advantage over Trump among seniors and 7-percentage-point-point edge among Christian conservatives .\n`` I 'm sick and tired of the political class , '' said Lisa Pilch , 54 , a middle school physical education teacher leaning toward Carson who lives in Springville , Iowa . `` I just like his tone and think he 's someone who could pull us together , rather than the polarization we have right now . He has a lot of wisdom , even if he does n't have political savviness . ''\nWhile Carson is doing slightly better than Trump among women , the billionaire has the advantage among men , 28 percent to 17 percent .\n`` He 's got a no-nonsense approach , '' said Patrick Messmore , 32 , a construction equipment sales manager who lives near Grundy Center and plans to back Trump . `` His history as a businessman is potentially a good change for our country , so that we do n't just have another life-time politician taking over as president . ''\nIn some ways , Messmore sees Trump as an antidote to Bush . `` I 'm not OK with another Bush presidency , '' he said . `` We 've had two of them now and I do n't see that there will be enough of a different approach than his dad or brother had . It \u2019 s just not something I 'm interested in . ''\nThe poll shows Walker and Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky , especially , are n't performing anywhere close to earlier expectations .\nPaul , who was backed by just 4 percent , was perceived a year ago to have an advantage in Iowa , given the third-place finish in the 2012 caucuses recorded by his father , former Representative Ron Paul of Texas . In October , his favorable rating outweighed his unfavorable by nearly 3-to-1 .\n`` Whatever advantage he had has eroded , '' Selzer said . `` Now , more Iowa caucus-goers have negative than positive feelings about him . ''\nFor Walker , who has been in a slump since his lackluster debate performance , the poll is certain to further reduce expectations around his performance in Iowa , which had grown to the point where anything short of a win would have been viewed as a loss . One upside for him in the poll : Besides Carson , he 's the only candidate to exceed 70 percent in favorability .\nIowa Republicans are showing little interest in re-runs . Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee , who won the 2008 Iowa Republican caucuses , is at 4 percent . He 's followed at 2 percent by candidates who are governors , Chris Christie of New Jersey , Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and John Kasich of Ohio .\nFormer Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania , who narrowly beat eventual nominee Mitt Romney in the 2012 caucuses , is backed by just 1 percent , the same level of support recorded by former Texas Governor Rick Perry , who is also struggling in his second White House bid even amid heavy spending in Iowa on the part of a super political action committee backing him .\nSenator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina , former New York Governor George Pataki and former Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore all recorded support of less than 1 percent .\nThe survey , taken Aug. 23-26 , included 400 likely Republican caucus participants . On the full sample , it has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points .\nBesides the nearly the nearly 40 percent of likely Republican caucus-goers who say Christian conservative is the best way to identify them , `` business-oriented establishment Republicans '' and Tea Party activists are roughly tied as the next largest groups , at 22 percent and 21 percent . Those who feel they are most closely aligned with the `` liberty movement , '' a bloc associated with Paul , represent only about 8 percent .\nTo offer another assessment of candidate strength -- something difficult to divine in such a crowded field -- Selzer created an index built on multiple measures in the poll . The index takes into account first and second choices , as well as a question that was asked on whether respondents could ever -- or would never -- support each candidate they didn \u2019 t name as their first or second pick . First choices were given double weight , while \u201c ever support \u201d was given a half weighting .\nUsing that system , Carson is narrowly ahead of Trump , 75 to 73 . Walker comes next at 55 , followed by Cruz at 53 and Rubio at 50 . The index and never/ever question also show some of the candidates could struggle to expand their support . Nearly half of likely Republican caucus participants , 48 percent , say they could never support Christie . For Paul , it 's 43 percent and for Bush it 's 39 percent .",
