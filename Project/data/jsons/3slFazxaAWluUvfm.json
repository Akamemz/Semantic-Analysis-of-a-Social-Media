    "content": "The real story about John Brennan \u2019 s security clearance is not that he lost it under a Republican president but that he once got one . One of the peculiar footnotes of Brennan \u2019 s history is that he obtained a position in Bill Casey \u2019 s CIA after having supported the Soviet-backed American Communist Party at the height of the Cold War . Had Casey conducted the polygraph test in which Brennan admitted to voting for Soviet proxy Gus Hall in 1976 , Casey would have tossed him out of the office . Casey hated communists . Whoever hired Brennan must have been a Deep State holdover from the Carter years .\nAll of Brennan \u2019 s propaganda about \u201c Trump-Russian collusion \u201d is just sour grapes over the loss of his preferred candidate , Hillary , for whom he was desperately auditioning by launching an unfounded investigation into her opponent , and a remnant of his pro-Soviet nostalgia . Brennan \u2019 s much-vaunted \u201c conscience \u201d was pricked not by Soviet leaders who slaughtered their own people and enslaved hapless nations but by a Russian leader who \u2014 brace yourselves \u2014 isn \u2019 t keen on postmodern Western propaganda in favor of gay rights . Brennan prided himself on his \u201c commitment \u201d to alternative lifestyles and would pad down the halls of the CIA in a \u201c rainbow lanyard , \u201d as Bill Gertz once reported . Putin \u2019 s refusal to hold \u201c gay pride \u201d parades in Moscow infuriated Brennan . He also didn \u2019 t care for Putin \u2019 s unsentimental approach to Islamic terrorism . Brennan defined jihad as \u201c self-improvement \u201d and lobbied Obama to embrace the fanatics of the Muslim Brotherhood . Brennan got his wish when the Obama-backed Morsi rose to power in Egypt and wrecked it .\nMichael Flynn thought that Brennan was a PC jackass of the first order , in thrall to the Muslims with whom he had traveled to Mecca during his stint as station chief in Saudi Arabia . Brennan got his revenge on Flynn by unleashing on him Stefan Halper , the vaguely pro-Republican oaf and Cambridge con man the Obama administration hired to spy on Trumpworld . Halper reported to his friends in British intelligence that Flynn in 2014 had been seen at a Cambridge University forum fraternizing with a Russian historian . That morsel of half-baked gossip was then fed to Brennan . In 2015 , the British and presumably Halper kept bird-dogging Flynn . Part of Brennan \u2019 s \u201c Trump-Russian collusion \u201d fetish feeds off his hatred for Flynn , who had criticized the Obama administration for pursuing a pointlessly anachronistic course against Putin . Islamic terrorism , not Russian nationalism , threatened the vital national interests of America , argued Flynn . Brennan stewed over this disagreement and exacted his revenge on Flynn through Justice Department official Sally Yates , a Democratic hack who had joined the anti-Trump ring in the Obama administration along with her subordinate Bruce Ohr and fellow saboteur Peter Strzok .\nThe only criticism that Trump deserves for yanking Brennan \u2019 s security clearance is its delay . He should have done it on day one . Brennan was a security risk from the start \u2014 an anti-American radical of staggering proportions who should never have been permitted within a hundred-mile radius of Langley . Putin , Trump once said , is \u201c laughing his ass off \u201d at the mayhem dolts like Brennan have caused . Putin is also no doubt laughing at the spectacle of a former communist rising to the top of the CIA , then conducting in his retirement an attempted coup against a patriotic president on the claimed grounds that he is insufficiently hostile to Mother Russia .\nLike the execrable Peter Strzok , with whom he conspired to \u201c stop \u201d candidate Trump , Brennan sputters about Trump as a \u201c Russian asset. \u201d But if anyone qualifies as a useful idiot for the Russians , it is Brennan . At the most critical moments in the Cold War , he was rooting for the Reds . He has gone from demanding \u201c d\u00e9tente \u201d to forbidding it , from raging about \u201c McCarthyism \u201d to impersonating it . Brennan never grew up . In his youth , he clamored for the overthrow of an American president ; nothing has changed in his dotage . He is still vowing to sabotage an American president , and indulges the adolescent delusion that he somehow speaks for the proletariat , insisting that it will \u201c defeat \u201d Trump .\nSamantha Powers , another lefty drip in Obama \u2019 s anti-Trump ring , warned Trump that he shouldn \u2019 t risk the wrath of Brennan .
