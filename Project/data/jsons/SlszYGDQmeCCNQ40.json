    "content": "Republicans have expanded their advantage in the final days of the midterm campaign and now hold an 11-point lead among likely voters on the question of which party should control Congress , a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Annenberg survey finds .\nSome 52 % of likely voters in the survey said they wanted the election to produce a Republican-led Congress , while 41 % favored Democratic control .\nA week earlier , Republicans had held a narrower , 5-point lead on the question in the Journal/NBC/Annenberg survey .\n`` The Democrats , who badly need some momentum , find little comfort in these results some ten days out from the election , '' said pollster Peter D. Hart , who helped conduct the survey . `` The thread holding things together for them is both more slender and now even frayed . ''\nBy historical measures , an 11-point lead on the question of which party should control Congress is large . Republicans held a seven-point lead on the question at this point in the 2010 election in a Journal/NBC survey , which used a different method to determine which voters were most likely to cast ballots . Republicans went on that year to make big gains in the Senate and to retake the majority in the House .\nIn the new survey , Republicans also led on the `` congressional control '' question among registered voters , a broader group than likely voters , with 46 % favoring GOP leadership and 42 % favoring Democratic control . The GOP lead had been two percentage points a week earlier .\n`` The GOP appears to be solidifying its lead , '' said Mr. Hart .\nThe midterm battle for control of the Senate will hinge on state-by-state dynamics in about a dozen closely contested races , where Democrats hope intensive campaigning has built a climate more favorable to their candidates than national polls suggest .\nStill , the Journal/NBC/Annenberg survey points to a national political climate that continues to favor Republicans . Coming amid fears of Ebola , the U.S. war on Islamic State terrorists and intensified campaigning just ahead of the election , the survey found that recent events had taken a toll on both parties but had hurt Democrats more .\nAsked whether the events of the past few weeks made them feel more or less favorably toward the parties , 53 % said it made them less favorable toward Democrats ; 40 % said they were less favorable toward Republicans .\nThe poll underscored that anti-Obama sentiment remains strong , but also that President Barack Obama is n't central to the election for a plurality of likely voters .\nAsked whether their votes for Congress would be a signal of support or opposition to Mr. Obama , 13 % said it signaled support , while 22 % said it signaled opposition . Some 34 % said it was not a signal either way .\nAt the same time , voters registered strong dissatisfaction with Mr. Obama 's response to the militant group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , also known as ISIS . Among likely voters , 57 % disapproved of his handling of the situation , while 40 % approved .\nMost of those who disapproved -- some 87 % -- said they believed Mr. Obama 's response was not aggressive enough . Only 9 % said they disapproved because they thought the U.S. response was too aggressive .\nThe poll , conducted Oct. 17-23 with the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania , has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points for registered voters and plus or minus 4.1 percentage points for likely voters .",
