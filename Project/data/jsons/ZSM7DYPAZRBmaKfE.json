On Friday morning , Trump responded to the North \u2019 s twin statements with yet another bellicose tweet : \u201c Kim Jong Un of North Korea , who is obviously a madman who does n't mind starving or killing his people , will be tested like never before ! \u201d\nNow , this isn \u2019 t the first time that Washington and Pyongyang have lobbed insults at each other during the Trump administration \u2014 far from it . But North Korea experts say the current round of threats is riskier than previous episodes .\n\u201c We 've never seen anything like it , \u201d Jenny Town , assistant director of Johns Hopkins University \u2019 s US-Korea Institute , says of Kim \u2019 s statement . \u201c I would not take this as bluster but would expect action . What action exactly is unclear , but I would expect it to be severe . \u201d\nThe highly unusual nature of the Kim statement , together with the highly specific nature of the atmospheric nuclear test threat , suggests that the country may really be gearing up to do something provocative . And experts say that as long as Trump insists on handling the North with angry rhetoric like his Friday morning tweet , rather than working to calm tensions , the situation is likely to keep escalating . It \u2019 s gotten to the point where the risk of actual war is , according to the Arms Control Association \u2019 s Kingston Reif , \u201c unacceptably high . \u201d\n\u201c The cycle of the threats and counter-threats has entered an even more dangerous phase , \u201d Reif explains . \u201c We have two volatile leaders with nuclear weapons making it personal and further digging in with their reckless rhetoric . \u201d\nWhat makes this Kim threat different from his previous ones\nNorth Korea makes threats against the US all the time without sparking this kind of reaction from experts . Just a week ago , for example , Pyongyang issued a statement threatening to \u201c annihilate the US imperialist aggressors \u201d and \u201c reduce the US mainland into ashes and darkness , \u201d adding that the US should \u201c be beaten to death with a stick fit for a rabid dog . \u201d\nYet this statement wasn \u2019 t greeted with the same level of concern among experts as the North \u2019 s Thursday night statements .\nThere are two reasons for that . The first is the source of the comments . Usually , North Korea \u2019 s threats are issued through official press outlets , like the Korean Central News Agency ( KCNA ) or the Rodong Sinmun newspaper . Kim Jong Un does not personally sign them , and he definitely doesn \u2019 t read them on state-run TV . The sheer rarity of a personal statement by the country \u2019 s dictator makes the statement a sign that the North is taking the current situation extremely seriously .\n\u201c The fact that it is written as if a personal memo from Kim Jong Un to President Trump is unprecedented and worth pause , \u201d Town explains . \u201c It 's clear that Kim feels justified in his actions and is insulted at the tone that Trump uses when he speaks of Kim . \u201d\nSecond , experts say the hydrogen bomb test threat is unique and particularly worrying . Typically , North Korea tests its nuclear weapons in an underground bunker at its Punggye-ri facility . Doing so contains the radioactive fallout and limits the risk of accidentally harming anyone . By contrast , detonating a bomb in the atmosphere over the Pacific Ocean , as the North Korean foreign minister threatened , could spread fallout far and wide .\nIn 1963 , the US and the Soviet Union agreed to cease atmospheric tests because the fallout couldn \u2019 t necessarily be contained . The last atmospheric test was conducted by China in 1980 . The North conducting one , even far away from populated areas , would be its most serious provocation yet .\n\u201c If [ Kim Jong Un ] did an atmospheric test , that would be a big , big problem , \u201d Mira Rapp-Hooper , a scholar at Yale University Law School who studies North Korea , tells me . \u201c [ Any ] president would feel compelled to respond in some way . \u201d\nThese two problems feed each other . Kim \u2019 s sense of personal slight could lead him to follow through on the atmospheric test , potentially leading to a response from Trump that brings us even closer to war .\n\u201c A personal statement from Kim certainly takes things to a whole new level , and if the North follows through on its apparent threat to test conduct an atmospheric nuclear test , we will be in very dangerous territory , \u201d says Laura Rosenberger , the National Security Council director for Korea and China in the Obama administration .\n\u201c This is not a game , and these are not just words , \u201d she adds .\nNone of this means that war is likely in the near future . Kim may very well not follow through on his threat to test a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific , and if he does , the American military and political response might well be more restrained than experts fear .\nBut the fact that we \u2019 re even worrying about this suggests that the Trump administration \u2019 s emerging strategy to deal with North Korea \u2014 fiery rhetoric coupled with a push for harsher economic sanctions \u2014 isn \u2019 t working very well .\nThe consensus among North Korea experts is that Pyongyang wants nuclear weapons to deter an American invasion . Threats , like Trump \u2019 s vow back in August to respond to North Korean threats against the US with \u201c fire and fury like the world has never seen , \u201d only cause it to feel more insecure . When it feels insecure , it lashes out \u2014 demonstrating its own strength in order to signal to Washington that an invasion would be far too costly .\nThe two sides are essentially caught in a cycle of escalation that could theoretically escalate into outright conflict \u2014 even though neither side actually wants a war .\nThe current situation \u201c is a continuation of the one that started with the \u2018 fire and fury comments , \u2019 \u201d Jeffrey Lewis , an expert on North Korea at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies , tells me .\nThe threat to test a bomb over the Pacific , specifically , is an example of this cycle in action . It \u2019 s the clearest way yet for the North to signal its own strength .\nThe test \u201c never would have been a consideration for [ the North Korean ] regime if Trump administration had n't embarked on a policy of continuous rhetorical escalation , \u201d Barry Pavel , a defense expert at the Atlantic Council , tweeted .\nThe solution to all of this , the experts say , is very simple : The Trump administration needs to stop unnecessarily antagonizing North Korea and instead start coming up with a strategy for managing the threat it poses .\n\u201c It is still a crisis of our own making , \u201d Lewis says . \u201c We can stop it any time by shutting the president up and working to deescalate the situation . \u201d",
