Two weeks later , Nevada \u2019 s governor ordered all the casinos to close , and Mr. Jennings had no choice but to suspend operations .\n\u201c We kind of hit the ground running on the Strip , but there was no Strip to get running on , \u201d he says , ruefully .\nFor Alyson Arnold of Warwick , Rhode Island , the problem was postponements . A ceremony officiant , specializing in outdoor weddings , she was preparing to conduct 60 weddings in 2020 , her best year ever . But in early March , as concerns grew about travel , the postponements began rolling in : two in March , three in April . Of the five ceremonies scheduled in May , two are already being rescheduled .\nOne of the worst things ? The uncertainty . \u201c Everyone \u2019 s sitting on the edge of their seat waiting for what will happen , \u201d she says .\nThree weeks ago , these workers had jobs . Suddenly they don \u2019 t . The threat of the coronavirus hit the economy like a tempest out of nowhere . And just as storms typically wreak more havoc on trailer parks than ritzy suburbs , this one appears to have hit the most vulnerable workers first . But there \u2019 s more : Because \u201c social distancing \u201d is the essence of the virus response , jobs rooted in social contacts face some of the biggest disruptions .\nThose , like Mr. Jennings , in the experiential marketing industry , staffing booths at conventions or handing out branded memorabilia at sporting events , quickly lost gigs when the first restrictions on huge crowds were put in place . Self-employed people reliant on private gatherings , like Ms. Arnold , were next .\nNow , the forced closure of nonessential businesses in many parts of the United States has pushed huge numbers of full-time employees \u2013 often in low-paid service industries \u2013 onto the unemployment rolls .\nDennis Roberson , a divorced father of four , can chuckle about his last paycheck from the Wormhole \u2013 a bar and music venue in Savannah , Georgia , that like other nonessential businesses in town was forced to close . The check got torn in half by accident . When he went to cash it Monday , it got a little surreal .\nThere was a long queue outside the bank . That was a new one . It was \u201c one in , one out , \u201d he says . Still , the check cleared . Its amount : $ 195 . \u201c I realized that \u2019 s all I have for the foreseeable future , \u201d he says . \u201c Pretty wild . \u201d\nRichard Mertens Jesus Morales , who lost his job at The Drake hotel , stands in front of his home in Chicago .\nNow , he has arrived at Forsyth Park , sporting a knit cap , sunglasses , and a white beard , after biking to Domino \u2019 s to pick up a free pizza from a promotion . He sits down under a tree to eat , puts his ear buds in , and closes his eyes .\nIt \u2019 s not yet clear how many Americans have been laid off . Last week , the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that a record 3.3 million workers filed a first-time claim for unemployment \u2013 more than four times the previous record set in 1982 . This week 's Thursday report set another new record , 6.6 million more for a two-week total near 10 million .\nOn Wednesday , payroll firm ADP \u2019 s research institute released a report showing that as early as mid-March , sectors such as retail and wholesale trade , transportation , construction , and administrative support services ( including temp work ) were starting to shed thousands of workers .\n\u201c Much bigger job losses are coming , \u201d warns Mark Zandi , chief economist of Moody \u2019 s Analytics . Some 56 % of U.S. counties , representing 80 % of the nation \u2019 s GDP , are in some form of lockdown , he says , although many employees continue to work from home . In all , about a quarter of the economy is shut down , he estimates , so he expects the unemployment rate to hit 10 % to 13 % this month .\nThat would be as bad or worse than at the height of the Great Recession . Some economists expect even higher levels of unemployment . The data also suggest that workers in some of the lowest-paid occupations were among the first to be laid off . \u201c Low and low-middle income households are being hit hardest by the crisis , \u201d Mr. Zandi says .\nIn Massachusetts , one of the top five states reporting first-time jobless claims last week , the biggest surge came in the health-care and social assistance sector . These workers run the gamut . Nearly half of them are home health aides , delivering care to the home-bound and earning nationally an average $ 24,000 a year . The rest are licensed nurses ( earning twice as much ) and medical and health services managers ( earning four times as much ) . Last week , more than 18,000 of them filed for unemployment in Massachusetts , up from 440 the week before , a mind-bending 4,000 % increase .\n\u201c Over 37 million U.S. jobs may be vulnerable to potential layoffs in the short term , \u201d conclude researchers at Cornell University \u2019 s law school . That \u2019 s assuming that the current crisis does not result in wider-spread , long-term layoffs . Of those 37 million nonsupervisory jobs , all but 2 million are low-quality , low-paid ones paying less than $ 28,000 a year , as measured by the researchers \u2019 U.S . Private Sector Job Quality Index . The biggest group , more than a quarter of those at risk : workers in restaurants and other food-service positions .\nIn the Lake Michigan shoreline community of South Haven , Michigan , Dolly Harris has been a server at downtown \u2019 s Phoenix Street Caf\u00e9 for 19 years . She and her co-workers were laid off March 16 , as Gov . Gretchen Whitmer called on restaurants and bars to close except for takeout or deliveries . Now Ms. Harris will be relying on Social Security and unemployment benefits to help make ends meet . She was able to complete the online process of applying for unemployment after a few frustrating hours of system freeze-ups . As of March 29 , she still did not know how much she will be receiving , but expects to learn this week .\nFinances aren \u2019 t the main concern for Ms. Harris . The virus is top of mind , particularly because her husband has been diagnosed with a pulmonary disease that makes breathing difficult . \u201c I \u2019 m afraid to go out and do something in public , \u201d Ms. Harris says . \u201c I thought about working a job at Meijer [ a regional supermarket ] , but I really don \u2019 t want to bring anything home like the virus . \u201d\nThe distinguishing feature of the current downturn is its speed . \u201c It was like bing , bang , boom ! Next day , no restaurants ! \u201d says Joe Ryal , a bartender at a restaurant on Chicago \u2019 s North Side . \u201c We \u2019 re all unprepared . \u201d\nCourtesy of Kristen Kloostra Kristen Kloostra , a massage therapist , yoga instructor , and small business owner in Wisconsin Dells , Wisconsin , had to shut down her business and has no other source of income . Her situation exemplifies how jobs that normally involve close proximity among people are heavily at risk in the coronavirus emergency .\nRetail workers face similar shocks . This week , a slew of chains announced extended closures and furloughs , including Macy \u2019 s ( a majority of its 125,000 employees ) and JCPenney ( many of its 85,000 workers ) .\nAnd the sudden brake-pedal on economic activity isn \u2019 t affecting low-paid occupations alone .\n\u201c I \u2019 m 100 % commission based . When they issue a stay-at-home order , they made us part of that , \u201d says Eric , a commercial realtor in the southwest part of Michigan who declined to have his last name published . Because of the long lag time between showing a property and closing a sale , \u201c the impact if you \u2019 re not working can be severe . ... When you have three months where you can \u2019 t show any properties , that \u2019 s more like eight or nine months where you \u2019 re not making money . \u201d\nHow long the virus threat and its economic repercussions will last is a burning question for many of the newly unemployed .\n\u201c To be honest , it \u2019 s been pretty scary , \u201d says Ashley D. , a bartender at a major national restaurant chain outlet in Oakland County , Michigan . \u201c I \u2019 m hopeful life will be back to normal in a few months , but even if this did all quickly resolve or improve , I \u2019 m afraid it would take a lot of time for people to feel comfortable coming back , both employees and guests . I know I \u2019 m leery about coming back right away . \u201d\n\u201c We are confident , we are thinking hopefully , that business will come back , \u201d says Jes\u00fas Morales , who worked conventions , banquets , and private meetings for 33 years at the Drake , one of Chicago \u2019 s fanciest hotels , serving the wealthy and occasionally the famous , including Bill Clinton , George W. Bush , and Princess Diana . ( Noticing his name tag , she told him she was delighted to be served by a man named Jesus , he recalls . )\nWhen tips were generous , he could bring home more than $ 1,000 a week . Now , as he relies on unemployment payments to cover his bills , he worries about when the hotel business and other activity will recover .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think it will come back as strong as before . I think it \u2019 s going to take a while , \u201d he says .\nAccording to Mr. Zandi , the economist , it will take three to four years to get back to something resembling full employment .\nSome help is on the way to ease the adjustment . Congress \u2019 s new $ 2.2 trillion Coronavirus Aid , Relief , and Economic Security ( CARES ) Act authorizes $ 1,200 for adults and $ 500 for children in low- and middle-income families . Checks are expected to go out over the next three weeks . Unemployment benefits also get a boost over the next four months : extra money and extra weeks of eligibility . Crucially , for many of the newly jobless gig workers and self-employed , the guidelines have been loosened so they qualify for the first time .\nMs. Arnold , the wedding officiant in Rhode Island , was able to sign up online on Monday . Mr. Jennings , the Las Vegas handbill entrepreneur , has had too many gigs to file online and so far has only gotten a busy signal when calling in to the unemployment office .\nIn the meantime , he \u2019 s serving as spokesman for the Help the Gig Economy \u2013 Coronavirus Income Relief fund , a GoFundMe campaign aimed at helping 100 experiential marketing workers , who often travel from state to state to work conventions and other events . The sponsors aim to raise $ 50,000 in 100 days . As of Wednesday , they \u2019 d raised more than $ 5,400 and helped 12 of the more than 600 people who have applied for aid .\n\u201c It \u2019 s been very grassroots , \u201d Mr. Jennings says . \u201c Most of our donations are people within the industry kicking in 20 bucks . \u201d\nA similar spirit is taking place in Chicago as workers in the food industry rally to help each other . On a warm spring day , the newly jobless Mr. Ryal has just emerged from the Big Star restaurant , which is giving away free food to workers in the service industry from 5 to 7 p.m \u2013 a scene repeated at other venues around the city .\n\u201c I \u2019 ll be able to survive , \u201d says Mr. Ryal , holding a brown paper bag of groceries and a Styrofoam container holding a serving of carne asada . \u201c We \u2019 re leaning on other people . \u201d\nBack in Savannah , Forsyth Park is nearly empty due to the stay-at-home order .\n\u201c I \u2019 m the captain of my own ship \u2013 and it \u2019 s not moving at the moment , \u201d says Mr. Roberson , the now-unemployed father . \u201c Still , my plan for now is just to ride the waves to where they are going to take me . \u201d\nHe looks down at the pizza box .
