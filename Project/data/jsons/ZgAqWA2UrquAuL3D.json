Candidates still need to have all of the other pieces of the puzzle : charisma , connection to voters , good ideas , a good campaign operation , \u201d says Sheila Krumholz of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics .\nStill , the road to elected office is littered with self-financing candidates who lost . Since Texas billionaire Ross Perot ran in 1992 , a half-dozen presidential candidates have contributed more than $ 1 million to their races . Only Mr. Trump was victorious .\nMr. Bloomberg \u2019 s ads are ubiquitous in major states like California , where other leading Democratic candidates will appear at a televised debate tonight . His positioning as a moderate is a tough sell to party faithful , despite his focus on gun control and climate change . But some political analysts say it \u2019 s too soon to rule him out , given the possibility that key rivals might stumble in early primary elections .\nMichael Bloomberg isn \u2019 t just a billionaire candidate . He \u2019 s also a record-setting one . In his recently announced bid for the Democratic presidential nomination , Mr. Bloomberg \u2019 s ad spending of more than $ 100 million is already nearly twice the personal funds that Donald Trump spent on his entire 2016 campaign .\nMichael Bloomberg , the last-minute entrant to the Democratic presidential primary , won \u2019 t appear on the debate stage in Los Angeles on Thursday . But he \u2019 s all over California , Texas , and other Super Tuesday states , where viewers can see him in an unprecedented ad campaign that outspends all of his party competitors \u2013 combined .\nThe ads are everywhere , clustered around game shows like \u201c Jeopardy , \u201d news and late-night talk programs , soap operas , and football . They underscore an unconventional campaign that is skipping the \u201c first four \u201d states to concentrate instead on the delegate-rich ones that follow in March . They also highlight in big green dollar signs the record-breaking sums that this multi-billionaire is pouring into his self-financed campaign , raising the question of whether an election can be \u201c bought . \u201d\nActually , there \u2019 s widespread agreement on that one . From the Bloomberg campaign itself to political savants and the track record of history , the acknowledged truth is that , while money sure can help , it is no guarantee of victory . Not even close . The road to elected office is littered with failed campaigns of the super wealthy .\n\u201c Money is never enough on its own . Candidates still need to have all of the other pieces of the puzzle : charisma , connection to voters , good ideas , a good campaign operation , \u201d says Sheila Krumholz , executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics , which tracks money in elections .\nOn the other hand , unlimited resources are a \u201c big plus , \u201d says Ms. Krumholz . They will allow Mr. Bloomberg , the former mayor of New York , to fund an extensive field operation and give him an \u201c immediate surge \u201d in his ability to get his message out and introduce himself to voters .\nThat surge is reflected in opinion polls , where the Real Clear Politics average has the self-made businessman and philanthropist at 5 % support among Democrats nationally . That \u2019 s fifth place behind Joe Biden , Bernie Sanders , Elizabeth Warren , and Pete Buttigieg . Interestingly , the other self-made billionaire in the race , Tom Steyer , is stuck at less than 2 % .\nStill , Mr. Bloomberg has a track record of success and a Super Tuesday oriented strategy that some political analysts say could prove viable if key rivals stumble .\nForbes calculates Mr. Bloomberg \u2019 s wealth at $ 55.7 billion , one of the richest people on the planet . His spending on ads so far \u2013 more than $ 100 million , according to Advertising Analytics \u2013 is nearly twice the personal funds that Donald Trump spent on his 2016 campaign . ( President Trump \u2019 s tally was $ 66.1 million , according to the Center for Responsive Politics , but he also benefited from billions of dollars \u2019 worth of media attention , so-called earned media . )\nMatt Mackowiak , a GOP consultant in Texas , where Mr. Bloomberg has campaigned and is also advertising in expensive media markets , says it \u2019 s entirely possible the latecomer could double or triple what he \u2019 s spent so far on the primary , and put out $ 1 billion or $ 2 billion for a general election . \u201c We \u2019 ve never seen funding at that level . \u201d\nBut warning signs for such a candidacy abound . Voters tend to be highly suspicious of money in politics , says Garry South , a longtime Democratic consultant in California . \u201c They kind of resent rich candidates who pop out of nowhere and spend unlimited amounts of money . \u201d\nSince Texas billionaire Ross Perot funded most of his losing presidential bid in 1992 , a half-dozen presidential candidates have contributed more than $ 1 million to their races . Only Mr. Trump was victorious .\nCalifornia is itself a showcase for failed self-funded candidates seeking executive office . An exception is Republican celebrity Arnold Schwarzenegger , the former governor who tossed $ 5 million of his own money into a recall election that was a special circumstance \u2013 involving no primary and 135 names on the ballot .\nMr. South questions whether Mr. Bloomberg can build the necessary field operation in California or generate enough enthusiasm among base voters . The billionaire governed New York for three terms as a Republican and only registered as a Democrat last year . He was strongly supported by his GOP predecessor , Rudolph Giuliani \u2013 now the Democrats \u2019 villain \u2013 and has donated to Republican candidates . His \u201c stop and frisk \u201d policy as mayor angered Democrats , though he recently said he was wrong and apologized .\nAnd then there \u2019 s the mere fact of his wealth \u2013 at a time when candidates like Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders are railing against millionaires and billionaires .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s very difficult for a candidate like Bloomberg to set up a real ground organization in California , \u201d Mr. South says . \u201c You have to do it with Democrat activists . You can \u2019 t do it with rent-a-maids . And there \u2019 s no reason for Democratic activists to be interested in his candidacy . \u201d\nThe Bloomberg campaign is well aware that history is not on its side when it comes to self-funding campaigns .\n\u201c Overwhelmingly , they lose , \u201d admits Marc LaVorgna , a spokesman for the campaign . But , he counters , Mr. Bloomberg is an \u201c outlier \u201d who has proved he can win \u201c again and again in the largest progressive city in the country , in New York City , and can govern extremely effectively , with high marks from New Yorkers , who are frankly tough graders . \u201d\nMr. Bloomberg \u2019 s entry into the race less than a month ago precludes a run in the early states of Iowa , New Hampshire , Nevada , and South Carolina . Instead , his unorthodox strategy is to simultaneously and immediately run two parallel campaigns . One is a primary effort that targets states in March and April where Democratic competitors are not presently focused , but which hold more than 65 % of the delegates needed to win the nomination . The other is a general election campaign in battleground states where President Trump \u201c has had a free run , \u201d says Mr. LaVorgna .\nUnlimited resources allow the campaign to go head-to-head with President Trump on digital advertising , and to widely distribute Mr. Bloomberg \u2019 s story as an entrepreneur ( he made his money on the \u201c Bloomberg terminal \u201d used by investors worldwide ) , a mayor , and a philanthropist . His ads portray him as a doer who has won battles with the gun lobby , coal , and tobacco \u2013 and who can beat President Trump .\nIn his campaign talks , he addresses his wealth head-on , saying he plows most of the profits from his business into his causes and was a self-made man who grew up in a Boston suburb where the most his dad ever earned was $ 6,000 in a year .\nAmid the focus on Mr. Bloomberg \u2019 s eye-popping ad buys , his spending paints a much broader picture . His \u201c Everytown for Gun Safety \u201d initiative has connected him with activists all over the country . Last year he spent extensively on electing House Democrats , and this cycle is putting up to $ 20 million into a voter registration drive , primarily aimed at minority voters .\nSupport for a mayoral training program at Harvard University has graduated a nationwide network of mayors who know him , including Michael Tubbs , the progressive African American known for testing \u201c universal basic income \u201d in Stockton , California .\nLast week , Mayor Tubbs endorsed Mr. Bloomberg during a visit to the Golden State in which the New Yorker also talked with former Gov . Jerry Brown at a climate event in San Francisco . The popular former governor did not endorse him , but the two launched a climate initiative together in 2017 .\nAnalysts call Mr. Bloomberg \u2019 s unusual campaign a long shot that can only work if no clear front-runner emerges before Super Tuesday , which is March 3 .
