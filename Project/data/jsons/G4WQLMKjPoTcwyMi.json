Ahead of his reelection , President Obama did not want to forgo this largely California- and Manhattan-based set \u2019 s sweet cash monies by green-lighting the project onto which pharisaic environmentalist groups have symbolically foisted all of their climate-change hopes ( and only they know why ) , and that campaign-minded motivation hardly holds any less true going into the midterms or even 2016 .\nSteyer specifically took it upon himself to create a self-funded , serial ad campaign of ultra-lame , ultra-deceitful TV spots to try and convince the masses that the Keystone XL pipeline somehow isn \u2019 t in America \u2019 s best interest ( a feat of misinformation on which even WaPo \u2019 s fact checker called him out with four Pinocchios ) , but he \u2019 s really looking to throw his weight around in the midterms by expanding his super PAC into the climate-change equivalent of Michael Bloomberg \u2019 s single-issue Mayors Against Illegal Guns . Via the NYT :\nThe donor , Tom Steyer , a Democrat who founded one of the world \u2019 s most successful hedge funds , burst onto the national political scene during last year \u2019 s elections , when he spent $ 11 million to help elect Terry McAuliffe governor of Virginia and millions more intervening in a Democratic congressional primary in Massachusetts . Now he is rallying other deep-pocketed donors , seeking to build a war chest that would make his political organization , NextGen Climate Action , among the largest outside groups in the country , similar in scale to the conservative political network overseen by Charles and David Koch . In early February , Mr. Steyer gathered two dozen of the country \u2019 s leading liberal donors and environmental philanthropists to his 1,800-acre ranch in Pescadero , Calif. \u2014 which raises prime grass-fed beef \u2014 to ask them to join his efforts . People involved in the discussions say Mr. Steyer is seeking to raise $ 50 million from other donors to match $ 50 million of his own . \u2026\nSo that \u2019 ll be at least $ 100 million for an all-climate-change , all-the-time approach to various midterm campaigns , but will he content himself with attacking Republicans , or also wield his operation against non-true-believing Democrats , too ? Unclear , but I can think of at least one senator for whom that kind of attention would be most annoying :\nThe new fund-raising push seeks to tap into the booming fortunes of Silicon Valley , where many donors rank climate change as their top political issue .
