    "content": "The constant sniping from staff could ultimately force Trump to dump his long-valued fixer , as he has done with former personal lawyer Michael Cohen and countless other ousted officials , like ex-Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former chief strategist Steve Bannon .\n\u201c Rudy Giuliani needs to stop talking , \u201d said a former campaign official who remains close to Trump \u2019 s team .\nGiuliani has been Trump \u2019 s attack dog since he was hired as an unpaid personal attorney April 2018 . But the president \u2019 s personal lawyer has now found himself at the center of an unfolding controversy over the president \u2019 s attempts to get the Ukrainian president to open an investigation into Biden and his son , Hunter .\nTo numerous Trump advisers , though , the appearances have hurt more than they \u2019 ve helped the president .\n\u201c Rudy right now needs to focus on himself and not Ukraine , \u201d said an outside Trump adviser .\nFor now , Trump is sticking with Giuliani , or \u201c My Rudy , \u201d as Giuliani said the president sometimes calls him . \u201c Nothing has changed on that , \u201d said Giuliani \u2019 s own attorney , Jon Sale . Trump plans to keep using Giuliani on everything but Ukraine matters because they know he \u2019 s a witness if this goes to impeachment , according to a source familiar with the legal team \u2019 s strategy .\nTrump said late Friday he did n't know if Giuliani was still his attorney . \u201c I have n't spoken to Rudy , \u201d he said . \u201c I spoke to him yesterday , briefly . He 's a very good attorney and he has been my attorney . \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 m not a puppy \u2014 I know what I \u2019 m doing , \u201d he said . If he didn \u2019 t represent Trump , Giuliani added , \u201c they would let him be a punching bag . \u201d\nIn a text on Saturday morning , Giuliani replied to the two most pressing questions he \u2019 s facing . \u201c No knowledge of any probe . Still President \u2019 s counsel in same way as before\u2026no change , \u201d he wrote .\nIn a Saturday morning tweet , Trump wrote : `` So now they are after the legendary \u201c crime buster \u201d and greatest Mayor in the history of NYC , Rudy Giuliani . He may seem a little rough around the edges sometimes , but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer . ''\nAt least one Republican suggested Giuliani would not leave even if Trump wanted him to . Either way , Giuliani is not going away , given his central role in the budding Ukraine controversy .\nGiuliani fed Trump the information that largely led the president in a phone call to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky . The former New York mayor had spent months trying to make contact with Ukrainian officials to collect evidence and convince them that they should be looking at Hunter Biden \u2019 s work for a Ukrainian gas company and Joe Biden \u2019 s Obama-era efforts to have a Ukrainian prosecutor removed over corruption concerns . There is no public evidence that either Joe or Hunter Biden broke any laws .\nHouse Democrats launched their impeachment inquiry after Trump \u2019 s request was revealed , spurring Giuliani to blanket the airwaves with his bulldog defenses of the president . Democrats have also subpoenaed Giuliani for documents and testimony related to his Ukraine activities , setting off a battle that \u2019 s likely to drag on for weeks .\nDon Goldberg , who helped respond to congressional investigations in the Clinton White House , said Giuliani shouldn \u2019 t be helping Trump when he \u2019 s facing his own problems .\n\u201c It \u2019 s so messed up , \u201d he said . \u201c You \u2019 d think a president would want to have competent counsel if you \u2019 re talking about fighting for your political life . We \u2019 re so far not seeing that with the caliber he \u2019 s been using . \u201d\nGiuliani suggested in an interview this week that his television appearances could be reduced now that Trump \u2019 s legal team is expanding .\nSome also speculated that the recent addition of former Rep. Trey Gowdy ( R-S.C. ) to the Trump impeachment legal team was an attempt to reduce Giuliani \u2019 s appearances on the airwaves .\nAlthough Gowdy \u2014 who led the congressional investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \u2019 s response to in the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attacks \u2014 won \u2019 t start as a Trump attorney until January , he could appear as a surrogate on television in the meantime .\nDemocrats initially launched an investigation into Trump on Sept. 24 after learning about his call with Zelensky .\nOn Sept. 19 , he denied he asked Ukraine to investigate the Bidens , only to admit it 30 seconds later .\nOn Sept. 24 , he blew up at radio host Christopher Hahn during a joint television appearance , calling him a \u201c moron \u201d and an \u201c idiot . \u201d\nOn Oct. 6 , he yelled at TV host Howard Kurtz , putting his fingers to his lips to shush him in the middle of the interview .\nAnd in a series of phone interviews , Giuliani described himself both as a \u201c hero \u201d and the real \u201c whistleblower \u201d in the Ukraine saga , questioning why anyone would praise the person who initially raised concerns about Trump \u2019 s call .\n\u201c If I get killed now , you won \u2019 t get the rest of the story , \u201d he warned \u2588\u2588\u2588 last month .\nMichael Gerhardt , a University of North Carolina law professor who has written books on impeachment , said Giuliani \u2019 s primary legal role is to appear on television .\n\u201c That \u2019 s helping facilitate the political arguments the president is making , \u201d he said . \u201c But at some point , if impeachment gets any traction , you \u2019 re going to need somebody that can speak more clearly and more powerfully with respect to the different points of the impeachment articles that may be drafted and ratified . \u201d\nGiuliani said he and Jay Sekulow , another Trump attorney , are still working for Trump because they successfully represented Trump during Mueller \u2019 s investigation into whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election .\n\u201c Jay and I got us through the last one , not the peanut gallery , \u201d Giuliani said . \u201c The president has made his views quite well known . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s not the first time prominent Republicans have complained to Trump about Giuliani . But those same allies say the situation has grown dire since the House opened its impeachment inquiry .\n\u201c I think he \u2019 s massively hurting , \u201d said a person close to the Trump campaign . \u201c His TV appearances are so confused and contradictory , he \u2019 s creating an impression of internal chaos . \u201d\n\u201c He \u2019 s inarticulate , \u201d said a Republican who speaks to the president . \u201c Rudy hurts the president with inconsistent , confusing messages . \u201d\nOne former senior administration official described it this way when asked what Trump \u2019 s strategy against impeachment should be : \u201c Hopefully Rudy will be on the space shuttle . \u201d\n\u201c As long as Giuliani is doing battle with the president \u2019 s perceived critics and opponents , that \u2019 s what matters to the president , \u201d said Republican strategist Kevin Madden , who worked for Mitt Romney \u2019 s 2012 presidential campaign . \u201c The efficiency of the performance is n't as important as the willingness to do battle . \u201d\nTrump admires Giuliani \u2019 s brand , his loyalty and his Trump-like style , according to people familiar with their relationship . He has both political and legal experience at the national level , and has known the president for decades .\n\u201c They have a brotherly relationship , \u201d said a second Republican who speaks to the president . \u201c He likes his combative style . \u201d\nGiuliani \u2019 s reputation soared after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , when he was dubbed \u201c America \u2019 s Mayor. \u201d These days , he \u2019 s regularly mocked on late-night shows and \u201c Saturday Night Live. \u201d His favorable ratings dipped to their lowest point in 2018 since Gallup began their polling on him in 2004 .\nStill , Trump supporters credit him with helping the president survive the Mueller investigation \u2014 and now exposing the Biden allegations .\nAt the White House Friday , senior aide Stephen Miller forcefully defended Giuliani . \u201c You should all be grateful Rudy Giuliani is helping to shine a light on the endemic corruption that occurred while Joe Biden was vice president , \u201d he told reporters , alluding to unsubstantiated claims that Biden got a Ukrainian prosecutor fired to protect his son .\nRepublican strategist John Feehery said Trump loves what he is doing . \u201c If this were any other president , Rudy would be a disaster , \u201d he said . \u201c There is a method to the madness .
