    "content": "U.S. Health Care Expenditures in 2019 Under current law , the government estimates that the U.S. will spend about one-sixth of G.D.P . on health care this year , with those costs divided between the federal government , individuals , employers and state governments . This estimate , from an economist close to the Bernie Sanders 2016 campaign , estimates the largest savings from converting to Medicare for all . This estimate assumes that Medicare for all will pay all medical providers the same amounts Medicare pays now . That decision means it would lower total health spending , but its author thinks the real system would have to pay higher prices . This estimate assumes that Medicare for all would need to pay all medical providers higher rates than Medicare pays them now . The Urban Institute estimate includes a limit on how many more doctors \u2019 visits people will be able to make . Even so , it projects a substantial increase in spending under Medicare for all . Even without including all the costs for long-term care , which some Medicare for all proposals include , this estimate still finds that Medicare for all would cost substantially more than the current system .\nHow much would a \u201c Medicare for all \u201d plan , like the kind endorsed by the Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren , change health spending in the United States ?\nSome advocates have said costs would actually be lower because of gains in efficiency and scale , while critics have predicted huge increases .\nWe asked a handful of economists and think tanks with a range of perspectives to estimate total American health care expenditures in 2019 under such a plan . The chart at the top of this page shows the estimates , both in composition and in total cost .\nIn all of these estimates , patients and private insurers would spend far less , and the federal government would pay far more . But the overall changes are also important , and they \u2019 re larger than they may look . Even the difference between the most expensive estimate and the second-most expensive estimate was larger than the budget of most federal agencies .\nEstimates of U.S. health care expenditures under Medicare for all in 2019 , as a share of G.D.P .\nThe big differences in the estimates of experts reflect the challenge of forecasting a change of this magnitude ; it would be the largest domestic policy change in a generation .\nThe proposals themselves are vague on crucial points . More broadly , any Medicare for all system would be influenced by the decisions and actions of parties concerned \u2014 patients , health care providers and political actors \u2014 in complex , hard-to-predict ways . But seeing the range of responses , and the things that all the experts agree on , can give us some ideas about what Medicare for all could mean for the country \u2019 s budget and economy .\nGerald Friedman , a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts , Amherst , whose estimates were frequently cited by the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign in 2016 .\nCharles Blahous , a senior research strategist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University , and a former trustee of Medicare and Social Security .\nAnalysts at the RAND Corporation , a global policy research group that has estimated the effects of several single-payer health care proposals .\nKenneth E. Thorpe , the chairman of the health policy department at Emory University , who helped Vermont estimate the costs of a single-payer proposal there in 2006 .\nAnalysts at the Urban Institute , a Washington policy research group that frequently estimates the effects of health policy changes .\nRight now , individuals and employers pay insurance premiums ; people pay cash co-payments for drugs ; and state governments pay a share of Medicaid costs . In a system like one introduced as a bill by Mr. Sanders or another from Representative Pramila Jayapal and the Congressional Progressive Caucus , nearly all of that would be replaced by federal spending . That \u2019 s why some experts describe such a system as single-payer . ( Other Democrats who are supporting coverage expansion through Medicare have offered more modest proposals that would preserve some out-of-pocket spending and a role for private insurance . )\nThe economists made their calculations using different assumptions and methods , and you can read more about those methods at the bottom of this article .\nThese two estimates , for example , from the Mercatus Center and the Urban Institute , differ by about $ 730 billion per year , roughly 3 percent of G.D.P . The two groups don \u2019 t often agree on public policy \u2014 Mercatus tends to be more right-leaning and Urban more left-leaning .\nEstimates of U.S. health care expenditures in 2019 under a Medicare for all system\nThe biggest difference between the Mercatus estimate and the Urban one is related to how much the new system would pay doctors , hospitals and other medical providers for health services . Mr. Friedman \u2019 s estimate , the least expensive of the group , assumed that the government could achieve the largest cost savings on both prescription drugs and administrative spending .\nHow much would doctors and hospitals and other providers be paid ?\nPay too little , and you risk hospital closings and unhappy health care providers . Pay too much , and the system will become far more expensive . Small differences add up . Estimated increase in Medicare payment rates paid to medical providers friedman blahous thorpe urban rand 6 % 0 % 5 % 7 % 9 %\nIn our current system , doctors , hospitals and other health care providers are paid by a number of insurers , and those insurers all pay them slightly different prices . In general , private insurance pays medical providers more than Medicare does . Under a Medicare for all system , Medicare would pick up all the bills . Paying the same prices that Medicare pays now would mean an effective pay cut for medical providers who currently see a lot of patients with private insurance .\nFor a Medicare for all system to save money , it needs to reduce the health care industry \u2019 s income somewhat . But if rates are too low , hospitals already facing financial difficulties could be put out of business .\nNeither Mr. Sanders \u2019 s legislation nor the Jayapal House bill specify what the Medicare for all system would pay , but they say that Medicare would establish budgets and payment rates . So our estimators offered their best guess of what they thought such a plan might do .\nMr. Thorpe said he picked a number higher than current Medicare prices for hospitals , because he thought anything lower would be unsustainable . Mr. Blahous said he constructed his starting estimate at precisely Medicare rates , though he thought the real number would most likely be higher . He also reran his calculations with a more generous assumption : At 111 percent of Medicare , around the average amount all health insurers pay medical providers now , the total shot up by hundreds of billions of dollars , about an additional 1.5 percent of G.D.P .\nBy negotiating directly on behalf of all Americans , instead of having individual insurance companies and plans bargain separately , the government should be able to pay lower drug prices . Estimated reduction in drug spending friedman blahous thorpe urban rand 31 % 12 % 4 % 20 % 11 %\nPatients in the United States pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs . That \u2019 s partly a result of a fractured system in which different payers negotiate separately for drug benefits . But it also reflects national preferences : An effective negotiator needs to be able to say no , and American patients tend to want access to the widest array of cutting-edge drugs , even if it means paying more .\nA Medicare for all system would have more leverage with the drug industry because it could bargain for the whole country \u2019 s drug supply at once . But politics would still be a constraint . A system willing to pay for fewer drugs could probably get bigger discounts than one that wanted to preserve the current set of choices . That would mean , though , that some patients would be denied the medications they want .\nAll of our economists thought a Medicare for all system could negotiate lower prices than the current ones . But they differed in their assessments of how cutthroat a negotiator Medicare would be . Mr. Friedman thought Medicare for all could reduce drug spending by nearly a third . The Urban team said the savings would be at least 20 percent . The other researchers imagined more modest reductions .\nHow much more would people use the health care system ?\nBy expanding coverage to the uninsured , adding new benefits and wiping out cost sharing , Medicare for all would encourage more Americans to seek health care services . Estimated increase in use of health care friedman blahous thorpe urban rand 7 % 11 % 15 % \u2014 8 %\nMedicare for all would give insurance to around 28 million Americans who don \u2019 t have it now . And evidence shows that people use more health services when they \u2019 re insured . That change alone would increase the bill for the program .\nOther changes to Medicare for all would also tend to increase health care spending . Some proposals would eliminate nearly all co-payments and deductibles . Evidence shows that people tend to go to the doctor more when there \u2019 s no such cost sharing . The proposed plans would also add medical benefits not typically covered by health insurance , such as dental care , hearing aids and optometry services , which would increase their use .\nThe economists differ somewhat in how much they think people would increase their use of medical services . ( Because of the way the Urban Institute team \u2019 s estimate was calculated , it couldn \u2019 t easily provide a number for this question . )\nRight now , the health care system is complicated , with lots of different payers and ways to negotiate prices and bill for services . A single payment system could save some money by simplifying all that . Estimated administrative costs as a share of all spending friedman blahous thorpe urban rand 2 % \u2014 6 % 6 % 5 %\nThe complexity of the American system means that administrative costs can often be high . Insurance companies spend on negotiations , claims review , marketing and sometimes shareholder returns . One key possible advantage of a Medicare for all system would be to strip away some of those overhead costs .\nBut estimating possible savings in management and administration is not easy . Medicare currently has a much lower administrative cost share than other forms of insurance , but it also covers sicker people , distorting such comparisons . Certain administrative functions , like fraud detection , can have a substantial return on investment .\nThe economists all said administrative costs would be lower under Medicare for all , but they differed on how much . Those differences amount to percentage points on top of the differing estimates of medical spending . On this question , there was rough agreement among our estimators that administrative costs would be no higher than 6 percent of medical costs , a number similar to the administrative costs that large employers spend on their health plans . Mr. Blahous said a 6 percent estimate would probably apply to populations currently covered under private insurance , but did not calculate an overall rate .\nAll of these estimates looked at the potential health care bill under a Sanders-style Medicare for all plan . In some estimates , the country would not pay more for health care , but there would still be a drastic shift in who is doing the paying . Individuals and their employers now pay nearly half of the total cost of medical care , but that percentage would fall close to zero , and the percentage paid by the federal government would rise to compensate . Even under Mr. Blahous \u2019 s lower estimate , which assumes a reduction in overall health care spending , federal spending on health care would still increase by 10 percent of G.D.P. , or more than triple what the government spends on the military .\nHow that transfer takes place is one of the least well explained parts of the reform proposals . Taxation is the most obvious way to collect that extra revenue , but so far none of the current Medicare for all proposals have included a detailed tax plan . Even if total medical spending stayed flat over all , some taxpayers could come out ahead and pay less ; others could find themselves paying more .\nRaising revenue would require broad tax increases that are likely to be partly borne by the middle class , potentially impeding passage . Advocates , including Mr. Sanders , tend to favor funding the program with payroll taxes .\nFor some people , any increase in federal taxes might be more than offset by reductions in their spending on premiums , co-payments , deductibles and state taxes . There is evidence to suggest that premium savings by employers would also be returned to workers in the form of higher salaries . But , depending on the details , other groups could end up paying more in tax increases than they save in those reductions .\nAfter Mr. Sanders \u2019 s presidential campaign released a tax proposal in 2016 , the Urban Institute tried to calculate the effects on different groups . But it found that the proposed taxes would pay for only about half of the increased federal bill . That means that a real financing proposal would probably need to raise a lot more in taxes . How those are spread across the population would change who would be better or worse off under Medicare for all .",
