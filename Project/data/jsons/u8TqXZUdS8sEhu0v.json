    "content": "Even as Americans struggle with the changes required by health care reform , an international survey released last week by the Commonwealth Fund , a research organization , shows why change is so necessary .\nThe report found that by virtually all measures of cost , access to care and ease of dealing with insurance problems , Americans fared poorly compared with people in other advanced countries . The survey covered 20,000 adults in the United States and 10 other industrial nations \u2014 Australia , Canada , France , Germany , the Netherlands , New Zealand , Norway , Sweden , Switzerland and Britain , all of which put in place universal or near-universal health coverage decades ago . The United States spends far more than any of these countries on a per capita basis and as a percent of the national economy .\nFor that , it gets meager results . Some 37 percent of American adults went without recommended care , did not see a doctor when sick or failed to fill prescriptions in the past year because of costs , compared with 4 percent in Britain and 6 percent in Sweden . Nearly a quarter of American adults could not pay medical bills or had serious problems paying them compared with less than 13 percent in France and 7 percent or less in five other countries . Even Americans who were insured for the entire year were more likely than adults abroad to forgo care because of costs , an indication of how skimpy some insurance policies are .\nWhen Americans got sick , they had to wait longer than people in most of the other countries to get help . Fewer than half were able to get same-day or next-day appointments with a doctor or nurse ; one in four had to wait six days or longer . ( Only Canada fared worse on both counts . ) But Americans got quicker access to specialists than adults in all but two other countries .",
