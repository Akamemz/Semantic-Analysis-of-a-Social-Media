In any case , the headline expressed a view of Castro that many people have , all over the world : Castro as defier of the yanqui colossus and its imperialism . But that is a U.S.-centric view . Oddly , Cubans tend to view Castro as their dictator .\nOr former dictator , or , now , late dictator . Their current dictator is the younger Castro brother , Ra\u00fal .\nThe Castros and their compadres fought their revolution in the 1950s and triumphed on New Year \u2019 s Day 1959 .

And they had been promised one .\nYet the Castros , Che Guevara , and that gang quickly turned the island into something all too familiar in the world : a one-party dictatorship with a gulag . People streamed out of the country , if they were able . One of them was Juanita Castro , who had fought alongside her brothers .\nExplaining her defection , she said , \u201c I could not remain indifferent to what is happening in my country .
