    "content": "President Donald Trump recently slammed the World Health Organization ( WHO ) for how it has handled the coronavirus pandemic , pointing out that the agency had `` literally called every shot wrong . '' He 's right about that . But then , so did officials at every level of government , starting with Trump himself .\nIf there is any \u2588\u2588\u2588 for the WHO to exist , it is to alert the world to burgeoning health threats . The WHO 's director-general , Tedros Adhanom , did the opposite . He ignored early signals that this virus was spreading , assuring everyone that China , which had lobbied aggressively for him to head the WHO , had everything under control . He rejected Taiwan 's pleas in mid-January to declare a `` public health emergency of international concerns '' after it witnessed an alarming rise of disease clusters among visitors from the mainland .\nNor did Tedros hit the alarm button after the WHO conducted its own fact-finding mission to China at the end of January . Instead he declared that the Chinese had `` rolled out perhaps the most ambitious , agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history , '' thus `` creating a stronger first line of defense '' for the global community . He reached this remarkably inaccurate conclusion by swallowing Beijing 's official tally for COVID-19 case and mortality rates . British analysts estimate that those may have undercounted the actual numbers by a factor of anywhere from 15 to 40 .\nObscenely , Tedros even complimented China 's leadership for the `` transparency it had demonstrated '' \u2014after the government had arrested researchers for telling their international peers about the growing threat .
