Some of us hear it, and some of us don\u2019t. Mr. Obama doesn\u2019t want to be a wartime leader \u2014 Washington at Valley Forge, Lincoln at Fort Sumter, Roosevelt at Pearl Harbor \u2014 but there he is, like it or not. Everyone, friend and foe, knows he doesn\u2019t like it, and that makes him a leader who can\u2019t lead.\n\nNo president wants to go to war. Lincoln tried amelioration, promising not to interfere with slavery, but other causes of war prevailed. FDR stayed out of the war in Europe longer than he should have, since it was clear that decency and civilization were at stake, and only Pearl Harbor pushed him closer to the inevitable. Even then Hitler jumped first. Wars kill people and break things, and nobody sees that with the clarity of a president.\n\nBut a president must see the enemy for who and what he is when the first blows fall. Reluctance and reticence must retreat in the face of reality. Delay quickly becomes disaster. \u201cThe buck,\u201d as Harry S. Truman said of his desk in the Oval Office, \u201cstops here.\u201d Regret it as he will, President Obama is a wartime president with all the realities and responsibilities of a wartime president.\n\nNo one has set out the dilemma for both the president and the country more succinctly than Tom Cotton, the freshman senator (a Republican, if that matters) from Arkansas. \u201cPresident Obama is a wartime president who doesn\u2019t seem to realize it,\u201d he said after listening to the president on Sunday night. \u201cFourteen Americans were slaughtered by Islamic terrorists, but the president is dangerously detached from reality, lecturing us about political correctness and ineffective gun control.\n\n\u201cRadical Islamic jihadists are not contained and are advancing on every front \u2014 killing innocent civilians from California to Paris to Mali, blowing an airplane out of the sky in Egypt, and inflaming the entire Middle East from Tehran.
