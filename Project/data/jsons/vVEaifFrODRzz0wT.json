    "content": "One of the biggest points that former Special Counsel Robert Mueller made during his House testimony on Wednesday was about Russian election interference : He warned that it was a major problem in 2016 and emphasized that it could be just as bad in 2020 .\n\u201c Over the course of my career , I \u2019 ve seen a number of challenges to our democracy , \u201d Mueller said . \u201c The Russian government \u2019 s effort to interfere in our election is among the most serious . \u201d\nShortly following Mueller \u2019 s appearance in the House on Wednesday , Sens . Mark Warner ( D-VA ) , Ron Wyden ( D-OR ) and Richard Blumenthal ( D-CT ) sought to leverage his testimony and urged a vote on a package of election security bills , including the FIRE Act , which would require all political campaigns to report contact from a foreign government to the FBI . Each bill they proposed was quickly shut down by Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith ( R-MS ) .\nThis is , of course , not the first time Republicans have blocked Democratic efforts to put stronger election security restrictions in place as the 2020 election rapidly approaches . While the upper chamber has actually passed two somewhat related bills in recent weeks \u2014 one which prevents anyone convicted of election meddling to obtain a visa and another that deems hacking into an election a federal crime \u2014 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has strongly opposed the consideration of other bills on the subject .\nSen. Roy Blunt ( R-MO ) , chair of the Senate Rules Committee , which oversees aspects of election administration , laid out McConnell \u2019 s opposition during a hearing earlier this year . \u201c I think the majority leader just is of the view that this debate reaches no conclusion , \u201d Blunt said , noting that he didn \u2019 t see the point in considering any election security bills in committee if they simply weren \u2019 t going to go anywhere .\nMcConnell \u2019 s decision is likely driven by a few factors : He \u2019 s acknowledging President Donald Trump \u2019 s aversion to the subject \u2014 which the president sees as too closely tied to questions about the outcome of the 2016 election \u2014 and he \u2019 s maintaining concerns he \u2019 s long held about getting the federal government too involved in states \u2019 efforts .\nBlunt has previously also tried to shift the blame to House Democrats , explaining that the \u201c extreme \u201d nature of HR 1 \u2014 a sweeping anti-corruption bill championed by Democrats that contains tenets on election security \u2014 made it even less likely that McConnell would consider such measures . In an interview with McClatchy in April , Blunt noted that his party was concerned Democrats would use an election security bill to introduce additional amendments addressing issues raised in HR 1 , such as voting rights .\nMcConnell \u2019 s unwillingness to tackle election security isn \u2019 t just sending a political message , however ; it also has massive consequences .\nAs a result of this inaction , the US Senate \u2014 which allocated $ 380 million in election security funds last year \u2014 is now effectively promoting a do-nothing approach to a subject that Mueller and countless national security officials have raised as a serious threat that requires additional action . While US intelligence agencies and other bodies are doing what they can to bolster American defenses before the 2020 election , Republican leadership appears content to sit idly by despite numerous warnings about the need for more resources to prevent potential breaches .\n\u201c They are doing it as we sit here , \u201d Mueller said regarding Russian interference efforts on Wednesday . \u201c And they expect to do it again during the next campaign . \u201d\nAs Sen.

James Lankford ( R-OK ) . \u201c He called Republicans about the bill , didn \u2019 t want them to do it . And McConnell also didn \u2019 t want the bill to move forward .
