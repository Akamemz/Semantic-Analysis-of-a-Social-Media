Dianne Feinstein , California Democrat and her party \u2019 s ranking member on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , flatly stated that she believes terrorist cells are hiding in Europe and the U.S. , waiting to be activated and carry out attacks similar to the ones that claimed 17 lives in France last week .\n\u201c I think there are sleeper cells not only in France but certainly in other countries and , yes , in our own , \u201d she told CNN . \u201c This calls for vigilance . \u2026 Hopefully , we can be more active in terms of doing those things which enable us to find terrorists , see who they \u2019 re communicating with and to track that . \u201d\nMrs. Feinstein and Obama administration officials did not elaborate on how many suspected terrorists are in the country , nor did they discuss details of any terrorist plot .\nDespite the apparent lack of specific threats , polling data show the American people are deeply worried about a strike in the U.S .\nA Rasmussen poll released Sunday shows that 65 percent of Americans believe it is at least somewhat likely that an attack \u201c on those critical of Islam \u201d in the U.S. will occur over the next year . Just 26 percent said such an attack is not likely , the survey shows .\nThe poll was released just days after a string of terrorist attacks shook France . The violence began Wednesday with a mass shooting at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo , where 12 people were killed .\nAt least 1 million people \u2014 including more than 40 world leaders such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2014 marched in Paris on Sunday to honor the victims of last week \u2019 s attacks and to rally for unity and freedom of expression .\nThe U.S. sent only its ambassador to France , Jane Hartley .

He appeared on at least four Sunday morning political television shows in an attempt to reassure the American public that the administration is doing all it can to counter extremism .\nThe White House also announced that Mr. Obama would host an anti-extremism summit Feb. 18 . The gathering will focus on efforts to stop the radicalization of Americans by terrorist groups such as al Qaeda and the Islamic State , and ways to combat terrorist recruiting efforts .\nIn the meantime , Mr. Holder said the federal government is keeping a close eye on individuals who may be part of the sleeper cells Mrs. Feinstein is warning about .\n\u201c We are constantly evaluating where we stand with regards to those people who we have suspicions about . We have a universe of people who we focus on using legitimate means and keep track of them , \u201d Mr. Holder said on NBC \u2019 s \u201c Meet the Press. \u201d \u201c The American people should feel secure in what it is we do . \u2026 We are doing , as I said , the best we can . \u201d\nBut lawmakers believe more must be done in the wake of the attacks in France , which started when brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi stormed the Charlie Hebdo offices . The men targeted the paper because it published cartoons mocking Muhammad , Islam \u2019 s prophet . Al Qaeda \u2019 s branch in Yemen said it directed the attack .\nA day later , another terrorist , Amedy Coulibaly , killed a police officer and then took hostages inside a kosher market before police raided the building . Over the weekend , video emerged of Coulibaly pledging allegiance to the Islamic State .\nThe Kouachi brothers reportedly had weapons training in Yemen and were still able to travel back to France and carry out attacks . American lawmakers fear foreign fighters , after receiving training in Yemen or elsewhere , could travel to the U.S. and unleash violence .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve had thousands of these Western travelers that have become foreign fighters in Iraq , Syria and Yemen that pose a threat and a risk of returning to where they came from and to do the same thing we saw in Paris , \u201d Rep. Michael T.
