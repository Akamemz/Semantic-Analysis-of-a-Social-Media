'' he said in his speech at the 50th anniversary of the Bloody Sunday march in Selma , perhaps the most important of his presidency . `` What greater form of patriotism is there than the belief that America is not yet finished , that we are strong enough to be self-critical , that each successive generation can look upon our imperfections and decide that it is in our power to remake this nation to more closely align with our highest ideals ? ''\nAnd then there 's the second theme . Like any president , Obama is required to speak on sad , mournful occasions as well as celebrations and anniversaries . We ask the president to bind up the nation 's wounds , to bring us all together , to make meaning out of tragedy , and create hope with his eloquence . Obama has had to give that kind of speech again and again , and Tuesday he gave another , in a ceremony in Dallas honoring the five officers killed there last week . In speeches like this one , he 's more likely to return to his other great theme , that not only are we less divided than we might appear , but that our divisions can be bridged if only we allow ourselves to understand one another .\nThis was the theme of the speech Obama gave at the Democratic convention in 2004 \u2014 the one that , it is no exaggeration to say , enabled him to become president four years later .
