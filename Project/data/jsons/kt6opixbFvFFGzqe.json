Obamacare D-Day now a soft launch\nFor months all eyes have been on October 1 \u2014 the first day people can sign up for Obamacare .\nBut as that day approaches , many people working on the nuts and bolts of the health law are tamping down any expectations of a sign-up stampede .\nNot everyone will enroll immediately . And that , they say , is the way they want it .\nGiven all the worries that web sites could crash , call centers could be overwhelmed , and the federal government \u2019 s data hub could falter as it checks eligibility and subsidies , they \u2019 d rather see a slow buildup during an open enrollment season that runs through March .\n\u201c October 1 will be an important day to raise awareness , but it is the first day of a six-month public education effort , \u201d said Tara McGuinness , a senior White House communications adviser working on rollout of the health law .\nBut given the politics of Obamacare , expect a rush to judgment .\nRepublican opponents are going to want to declare the controversial legislation a failure , and the sooner the better . Either tepid enrollment or technical glitches will advance their argument that the law is doomed to fail . They see the White House as playing a game of lowered expectations rather than \u2018 fessing up to the failures .\n\u201c If I were HHS or CMS or whoever \u2019 s calling the shots over there , or the White House , I would think that would be a natural thing to do , \u201d said Sen. Pat Roberts ( R-Kan. ) , one of the skeptics . \u201c Part of me believes this is Thelma and Louise about 10 miles from the Grand Canyon . \u201d\nDemocrats -from President Barack Obama on down - say that hiccups are to be expected when the switch is flipped on the new state exchanges . It \u2019 s an intricate system that requires several complex government technology systems to successfully talk to each other \u2014 and to the consumer . A modest start to enrollment may reduce any start-up strain .\n\u201c There are going to be some glitches . No doubt about it , \u201d Obama said at a news conference last month . \u201c There are going to be things where we say , you know what ? We should have thought of that earlier , or this would work a little bit better or this needs an adjustment . \u201d\nAnd it could all get even more complicated if Congress doesn \u2019 t figure out how to avoid a government shutdown . That wold be because of the ongoing fight about Obamacare - and it could start the same day enrollment does , Oct. 1 .\nThe administration hopes to keep the glitches minimal-and to have time to repair them before Obamacare \u2019 s public image is further hurt . Alan Weil , executive director of the National Academy for State Health Policy , says \u201c no one gets hurt \u201d if a problem springs up in October and is fixed in November .\n\u201c October 1 is an important day but no one actually gets coverage until January 1 , \u201d Weil said . \u201c No one \u2019 s life changes on October 1 . \u201d\nDemocratic supporters of the law say that 2014 enrollment shouldn \u2019 t be measured until open enrollment ends in late March .
