    "content": "With support from Democratic Gov . Roy Cooper and the Republican-controlled legislature , North Carolina on Thursday passed what supporters brandished as a \u201c repeal \u201d of HB2 , the state \u2019 s anti-LGBTQ law . But LGBTQ advocates are furious , arguing that the deal falls far short of the full repeal they were hoping for .\nTo understand why , let \u2019 s back up . HB2 had two major parts : It overturned and banned local statutes that protect LGBTQ people from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity . And it prohibited transgender people from using bathrooms and locker rooms that align with their gender identity in schools and government buildings \u2014 due to a baseless myth that letting trans people use the bathroom or locker room for their gender identity would lead to men posing as trans to sexually harass and assault women in women \u2019 s facilities .\nThe deal does get rid of the latter : It makes it so state and local agencies in North Carolina can no longer regulate access to bathrooms or locker rooms , effectively ending the ban on trans people using the bathroom or locker room for their gender identity .\nBut the deal does not fully repeal the other part of HB2 . It does seem to let nondiscrimination laws passed by local governments before HB2 kick back into effect . But it also continues to prohibit local governments from passing nondiscrimination laws until December 1 , 2020 , so cities like Charlotte over the next three years still won \u2019 t be able to pass a new law that bans discrimination against LGBTQ people . And the deal permanently prevents all government agencies in North Carolina , from local to state , from setting up trans-friendly bathroom or locker room policies , since they \u2019 ll no longer be allowed to regulate access to these facilities .\nSince North Carolina has no statewide nondiscrimination laws protecting LGBTQ people , it will continue to be legal across much of the state for an employer to fire someone , a landlord to evict someone , and a business to kick someone out or engage in other kinds of discrimination solely because of the person \u2019 s sexual orientation or gender identity .\nIn fact , under the deal , private businesses will still be allowed to deny trans people the bathroom for their gender identity \u2014 and local governments will be powerless to stop them .\nThe deal is moving forward , but LGBTQ advocates are furious\nStill , the deal moved forward . On Thursday , the state House and Senate passed the deal , and Cooper signed it into law .
