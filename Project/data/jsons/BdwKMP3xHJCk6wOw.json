Al Franken Alan ( Al ) Stuart FrankenTake Trump literally and seriously in Minnesota Ninth woman accuses Al Franken of inappropriate contact Al Franken to host SiriusXM radio show MORE ( D-Minn. ) became the first current lawmaker to be accused of sexual misconduct last week when a Los Angeles radio news anchor said that he had forcibly kissed and groped her during a USO tour in 2006 .\nBut perhaps tellingly , the woman who came forward with the allegations , Leeann Tweeden , is not a member of the Capitol Hill community .\nIn the House and Senate , lawmakers and staffers alike say sexual harassment is a common problem that makes Congress no different from other industries roiled in recent weeks by documented cases of harassment and even assault .\nYet in a workplace where relationships are transactional and staff are expected to put their bosses first , victims have not put names forward .\n\u201c I think there \u2019 s a great reluctance to finger a member because there \u2019 s this fear that one \u2019 s career in the Capitol will be over if you come out , \u201d said Rep. Jackie Speier ( D-Calif. ) , who as a staffer experienced harassment on Capitol Hill in the 1970s .\n\u201c There \u2019 s an extra burden for a staffer to come forward on Capitol Hill right now if they \u2019 re still working in the building . \u201d\nSimilar pressures and fears kept accusations about Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein , comedian Louis C.K . and others under wraps for years . But since the Weinstein news broke , barriers seem to have come down .\nIn Congress , however , staffers and lawmakers with stories to tell seem uniquely reluctant to identify their harassers . It \u2019 s worth noting that women only make up about 20 percent of Congress , where seats are still mostly held by white men .\nRep.

She added that another current male lawmaker , who she has since learned to avoid , tried to proposition her .\nShe did not name either men , telling The Associated Press that \u201c I just don \u2019 t think it would be helpful \u201d to name the harasser who still serves in Congress .\nSpeier testified before the House Administration Committee that two current lawmakers of both parties have been accused of sexual harassment .\nShe similarly declined to name either lawmaker , citing one victim bound by a nondisclosure agreement and another who does not want to go public \u2014 an echo of the agreements used by Weinstein to hide his behavior .\nRep.

They \u2019 re expected to cater to their bosses \u2019 every need and put the team over themselves , whether that team is their employing office , political party or the institution itself .\nTravis Moore , the founder of TechCongress and former legislative director to ex-House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry Waxman ( D-Calif. ) , put it this way : \u201c You \u2019 re no longer Travis Moore . You \u2019 re Team Waxman . \u201d\nMoore recently spearheaded a letter signed by more than 1,500 former Hill staffers urging lawmakers to reform sexual harassment prevention policies . He specifically limited it to former staffers because of the political constraints on people who currently work in congressional offices .\nLike Hollywood and the media , Congress remains a male-dominated workplace where women frequently find it hard to be taken as seriously .\nWomen often want to appear tough and might laugh off inappropriate behavior . Or they question themselves whether interactions that made them uncomfortable quite meet the legal definition of sexual harassment .\n\u201c It \u2019 s still in many ways a man \u2019 s world and women kind of are always aware of trying to be sure that they \u2019 re taken seriously and treated equally , \u201d said Kristin Nicholson , the director of the Government Affairs Institute and former chief of staff to Rep.
