Ted Cruz won an upset victory over Donald Trump , with a state-of-the-art turnout operation that overcame the less-organized billionaire \u2019 s strength as a showman and lead in the polls . But together , their combined vote count \u2013 52 percent \u2013 represented a win for outsiders who reject the status quo in Washington .\nIn the Democratic race , former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton barely eked out a victory over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , a self-described democratic socialist . And as the prohibitive favorite among party regulars at the start of the campaign , Mrs. Clinton was deeply wounded by her inability to fend off Senator Sanders , allowing the populist outsider to declare a \u201c moral victory . \u201d\n\u201c Given the conventional wisdom going in , and if turnout was as high as it now seems , @ HillaryClinton may have done well to escape with a tie , \u201d tweeted David Axelrod , former political adviser to President Obama .\nThe way Democratic caucuses are run here , raw vote totals aren \u2019 t reported , just the number of county convention delegates won . The state Democratic Party declared Clinton the winner early Tuesday morning by 4/10ths of a percent , the closest Iowa Democratic caucus outcome in history .\nThe results of both caucuses showed a restive population , angry about stagnant middle-class wages , fearful over national security , and frustrated by Washington \u2019 s inability to break through gridlock .\nThat anger and frustration have been captured most pungently by Mr. Trump , a true outsider running in his first political campaign and relying on his considerable skill as a reality TV star to attract media and voter attention . But Trump went long on showmanship , staging big flashy rallies around the country , and short on the technology , data , and \u201c boots on the ground \u201d needed to get voters to turn out in sufficient numbers to win .\nSuddenly , the man who campaigned on being a \u201c winner , \u201d based on polls and crowds , is now a loser . Cruz won 27.7 percent to Trump \u2019 s 24.3 percent \u2013 not a blowout by any means , but a loss is a loss .\nIowa State Sen. Brad Zaun , who endorsed Trump , said the billionaire \u2019 s fame made it difficult for him to campaign as a conventional candidate . Cruz , for example , visited all of Iowa \u2019 s 99 counties , appearing in coffee shops and community centers .\n\u201c Trump visited the four corners of Iowa , but it wasn \u2019 t realistic to do all 99 counties , because there weren \u2019 t enough venues large enough to accommodate his crowds , \u201d said Mr. Zaun , in an interview outside Trump \u2019 s post-caucus event .\nIn his speech to supporters Monday night , Trump won praise for his gracious remarks as he congratulated Cruz . But now the real estate magnate heads into the next contest , the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 9 , needing a comeback victory to get his winning narrative back on track .\nTrump leads in New Hampshire with an average of 33 percent of the vote , well ahead of the rest of the pack . But post-Iowa , it \u2019 s not clear how likely Republican primary voters will react to the bursting of the Trump bubble . Before Iowa , some analysts predicted a profound impact .\n\u201c If Cruz wins Iowa , for New Hampshire it will be like taking a deck of cards and throwing them in the air , \u201d said New Hampshire pollster Dick Bennett , head of American Research Group , last week . \u201c Trump \u2019 s whole campaign is predicated on being a winner . \u201d\nAnother winner Monday in Iowa was Sen. Marco Rubio ( R ) of Florida , who beat expectations with a solid third-place showing of 23 percent \u2013 well ahead of his pre-caucus average in the polls of 17 percent . The rest of the large GOP field scored in single digits .\nBut the playing field in New Hampshire will be considerably different . Cruz \u2019 s extensive outreach to evangelicals played well with Iowa Republicans , but in New Hampshire , the religiously minded are a much smaller audience .\nIt may make sense for Cruz to skip New Hampshire and focus on South Carolina and the Southern states of Super Tuesday ( March 1 ) , some analysts suggest . But Cruz , seeking to show that his Iowa success isn \u2019 t just proof that he \u2019 s a good niche candidate , like the last two winners of the Iowa caucuses , may opt to play hard in the Granite State . His pitch isn \u2019 t just to the faithful ; it \u2019 s also as a rock-solid conservative known for his aversion to compromise .\nIf Cruz does fight hard in New Hampshire , he will face not only Trump \u2019 s big early lead , but also stiff competition from candidates who mostly gave Iowa a pass and have focused hard on a GOP electorate in New Hampshire that is more establishment-friendly .
