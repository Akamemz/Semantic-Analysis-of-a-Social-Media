    "content": "A new report from the Solar Foundation has found that the solar industry added jobs almost 20 times faster than the national average last year , adding over 31,000 jobs in the sector between Nov. 2013 and Nov. 2014 . In the last five years , the number of people employed in the solar industry also grew by 87 percent , from 93,000 jobs to 173,807 .\nAlmost 90 percent of jobs added in the sector were in installation , meaning that more and more Americans are opting for the power source , thanks to falling prices and various financing options .\n`` That has made it a no-brainer for a lot of people to go solar , '' said Andrea Luecke , executive director of the Solar Foundation , in an interview with the Washington Post . `` If you can get solar installed on your roof for zero down and pay less than what you 're currently paying your utility and not have to worry about maintenance , it 's a pretty easy sell . ''\nAccording to the report , the solar installation sector beat out the oil and gas pipeline construction industry and the crude oil and natural gas extraction industry in 2014 , creating almost 50 percent more jobs than those industries did . The report also expects solar jobs to continue to grow in 2015 , predicting that more than 36,000 jobs will be added over the next 12 months .
