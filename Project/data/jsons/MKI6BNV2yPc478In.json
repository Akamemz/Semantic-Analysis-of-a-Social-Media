He brought a lot of bad things and sectarianism wars here . ''\nBut the celebration was cut short Friday evening by a stabbing attack against demonstrators reportedly carried out by veiled men \u2013 an ominous sign for Iraq \u2019 s murky future . Indeed , the drone strike has infuriated the Baghdad government \u2013 not only blindsiding them but embarrassing them by signifying what little control they have over their sovereignty .\n\u201c Things are moving very fast , but the leaders want the U.S. troops out now , \u201d one high-ranking official who was not authorized to speak on the record told Fox News . \u201c The U.S. was only authorized to be in Iraq with the government \u2019 s approval for a specific purpose \u2013 to fight ISIS . This was a violation of that agreement . \u201d\nIraqi Prime Minister Abdul Mahdi concurred that the strike breached the conditions of U.S. military presence in Iraq and \u201c should be met with legislation that safeguards Iraq \u2019 s security and sovereignty .\n\u201c This is reckless . We want President Trump to study the consequences for killing Soleimani , \u201d Sameera Abdullah , 33 , contended . \u201c We want reckless , irresponsible acts taken away from Iraq . \u201d\nThe Iran-backed militias that spawned in Iraq , known as the Popular Mobilization Forces ( PMF ) , have been quick to threaten prompt revenge on U.S. personnel and interests . Slaughtered alongside Soleimani at the airport was his close confidante Abu Mahdi al-Mohandas , the deputy head of the PMF .\n\u201c [ We ] will not wait to be targeted in this country or others , we will not wait for the Iraqi government to take retaliation for this killing , \u201d said Hashim Ahmed , a member of the PMF branch known as the Islamic Resistance . \u201c The resistance will respond very soon by attacking U.S. presence by missiles . \u201d\nKhakis al Khazali , leader of the PMF outfit Righteous League , underscored that their fighters have been called \u201c to be ready \u201d and warned that the presence of U.S. and Israel elements would be eliminated . Others warned that PMF top-brass were discussing an imminent attack on the U.S embassy in nearby Beirut .\n\u201c It won \u2019 t be a conventional war like 2003 , \u201d one former Iraqi official contended . \u201c They are just going to keep escalating through the occasional proxies and drone strikes . Older U.S. administrations understood the balance Iraq wanted to achieve by having relations with both Iran and the United States . However , [ the ] Trump administration wants Iraq to pick one side only . \u201d\nThe U.S embassy in Baghdad immediately urged all American citizens to leave the country , and foreign oil company employees were moved to the southern city of Basra for hasty evacuation .\nAccording to multiple U.S. defense officials and experts , preparations are well underway to shore up American security in the region , including tactical air defenses . The U.S. military has also made clear it will preemptively target Iranian-backed forces if there are any signs of further assaults on U.S. bases and interests .\nPentagon officials announced Friday that they would be sending nearly 3,000 more troops from the 82nd Airborne Division to the region in \u201c a response force to threats throughout the region. \u201d An additional 100 U.S. Marines have also been dispatched from Kuwait .\nThe uptick in hostilities comes less than a week after the Iranian-backed militia Kata \u2019 ib Hezbollah launched a rocket attack in the oil-rich city of Kirkuk , killing an American contractor . Pro-Iran militia members also attempted to swarm the heavily-fortified U.S. embassy this week , ratcheting up pressure on all sides .\n\u201c Basically , you have anywhere between 50,000 and 100,000 militiamen with combat training and heavy weapons , \u201d another Middle East weapons tracker , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , said of the PMF militias .\nThe Baghdad government was forced to officially recognize the PMF , despite being largely endorsed and weaponized by Tehran , as a component of their Armed Forces during the operation to defeat ISIS . Iraqis routinely refer to them as \u201c street fighters \u201d who adhere to few rules and regulations on the battleground . While the U.S. refused to work directly with them , PMF units were able to obtain American heavy weapons and equipment . Several militia leaders also told Fox News that PMF fighters joined operations they were prohibited from simply by trading a uniform with an Iraqi soldier or policeman .\nWhile disruption orchestrated by the PMF fighters may be more swift , other analysts on the ground predict Tehran will take its time devising a more calculated response .\n\u201c The direct action on Soleimani has taken everyone by surprise , especially the Iranians . Their response directly or by proxy is unlikely to happen soon as they need a new leader to orchestrate it and will pause for thought , \u201d one Western intelligence expert based in the region said . \u201c People are waiting to see how this plays out . \u201d\nMoreover , the head of the Iranian National Security Committee , Mojtaba Dhul-Nur , warned that \u201c 36 American bases are under our fire \u201d and boasted , \u201c It is easy for us to deal a heavy blow . This crime will not pass easily . \u201d\nAccording to terrorism-monitoring channel Jihadoscope , regime sympathizers have been quick to launch a Twitter campaign entitled \u201c al intiqam al Qassim , \u201d which means \u201c hard revenge , \u201d and functions as a play on words for the slain general .\n\u201c Iran will launch its proportionate response through its proxy militias . If it can , Iran will most probably target U.S. military assets in Iraq , Syria or Afghanistan , or attempt assassinations on high-profile U.S. government officials , \u201d cautioned defense expert John Wood . \u201c In the meantime , there will be a ratcheting up of Iranian cyberattacks on any and all U.S. interests that it has found vulnerable , especially those related to the U.S. government . \u201d\nIRAN PREPARES FOR CYBERWAR AMID RISING TENSIONS , BOASTS THOUSANDS OF CYBERBATTALIONS\nJeff Bardin , the chief intelligence officer at cybersecurity firm Treadstone 71 , told Fox News that almost immediately after Soleimani 's death , Iranian hackers began infiltrating U.S. city websites , searching for susceptibilities . By Friday afternoon , dozens of U.S. sites were hacked with the same image of the late Soleimani \u2019 s face against a black background and the phrase \u201c down with America . \u201d\n\u201c The killing of Soleimani is very different from previous U.S. strikes . This wasn \u2019 t a terrorist leader . The U.S. just took out a key government official in Iran . That is going to demand a government-level response from Iran , \u201d said Karim Hijazi , the founder and CEO of private cyber and intelligence firm Prevailion . \u201c A cyber-attack is the fastest and most effective way for the Iranian government to respond , while also diminishing the risk of provoking a conventional U.S. military attack . \u201d\nHijazi stressed that Iran \u2019 s cyber operations have already infiltrated many of America 's critical infrastructure systems , including oil/gas , the electric grid and water supply . The whole idea behind such infiltration is to establish backdoors in these systems and then activate them when needed \u2014 such as during a time of war .\n\u201c For the Iranians , this attack is likely viewed as just that , so I would expect they will be awakening these dormant infiltrations in order to carry out significant attacks on U.S. assets . They are probably looking at easily accessible water systems , and electric utilities in weather vulnerable regions , \u201d Hijazi continued . \u201c Iran has two dominant threat groups that could carry out these attacks , and they should be feared . They are APT33 and APT34 . They have the capability to carry out sophisticated attacks against well-defended systems . Iran also has a lot of experience and technical capability when it comes to attacking ICS ( industrial control systems ) , given their own preeminence in the oil industry . \u201d\nFurther north in the semi-autonomous Kurdish Regional Government , a sense of exultation was also shared \u2013 but with a muted response from the leadership , who still need to maintain diplomatic ties with their often aggressive neighbor .\nInside Iran , the mood has been mixed . Dozens gathered to recite Koranic verses , draped in robes of mourning , inside Soleimani 's hometown of Kerman . Others celebrated quietly in the safety of their homes . Morning prayers broadcast on state television featured worshippers bursting into tears and chanting \u201c death to America , \u201d according to footage obtained by the Middle East Research Institute .\n\u201c Some people are very happy ; some people are very sad . There is no middle , \u201d one Tehran-based artist said . \u201c But ultimately , people are waiting on the decision of the regime \u2013 whether we will go to war or not . \u201d",
