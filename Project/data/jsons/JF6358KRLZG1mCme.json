    "content": "The Supreme Court \u2019 s recent same-sex marriage ruling left many conservative Christians steamed , with some calling for new constitutional amendments and others urging resistance against America \u2019 s new legal reality .\nBut many leaders on the religious right accepted defeat quietly , embraced their new underdog status , and began coalescing around an invigorated crusade for \u201c religious liberty , \u201d with a strategy modeled on the very social movement that just beat them in court : gay-marriage advocates .\n\u201c Same-sex marriage has been the looming cultural issue of the moment , \u201d said Phillip Bethancourt , executive vice president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission , an offshoot of the right-leaning Southern Baptist Convention . \u201c Religious liberty issues are the next horizon . \u201d\nThe religious right rose to prominence in American politics in the 1980s , under the banner of Jerry Falwell \u2019 s now-defunct \u201c Moral Majority. \u201d But now , Bethancourt said , conservative Christians have become a \u201c moral minority \u201d living in a \u201c post-Bible belt \u201d America that discriminates against them .\nJustice Samuel Alito employed similar rhetoric in his same-sex marriage dissent , warning that Justice Anthony Kennedy \u2019 s sweeping decision will be \u201c used to vilify Americans who are unwilling to assent to the new orthodoxy. \u201d Justice Clarence Thomas agreed , writing in his own dissent that the ruling could have \u201c potentially ruinous consequences for religious liberty . \u201d\n\u201c It seems like the oppressor is now taking on the mentality of the oppressed , \u201d said Brandan Robertson , a self-described evangelical who supports same-sex marriage .\nA number of Republican presidential candidates have echoed those arguments following the high court \u2019 s decision .\nLouisiana Gov . Bobby Jindal told Fox News that \u201c already Christian businesses are facing discrimination if they don \u2019 t want to participate in wedding ceremonies that violate their sincerely held beliefs. \u201d Former Arkansas Gov . Mike Huckabee similarly warned in a USA Today op-ed of businesses \u201c economically terrorized \u201d for their beliefs and the ruling \u2019 s coming \u201c collision with the First Amendment guarantee of religious liberty . \u201d\nSimilar worries about the plight of religious dissenters surfaced sporadically before the court \u2019 s decision \u2014 mostly in states with gay marriage and LGBT anti-discrimination laws or occasionally on a national scale , in reference to debates over abortion and contraception . But now , longtime evangelical leader Gary Bauer said , there \u2019 s widespread consensus among conservatives that \u201c the next battlefield is protecting religious liberty , \u201d with a particular emphasis on Americans whose religious beliefs prevent them from partaking in same-sex marriage ceremonies .\nIn the wake of the court \u2019 s decision , the religious right has already begun pushing new religious freedom laws and executive orders in state governments specifically targeted at preventing state agencies from penalizing businesses and individuals who refuse to participate in gay weddings .\nKansas Gov . Sam Brownback became the first Republican politician to take action , issuing an executive order Tuesday that forbids the state government from penalizing any religious leader or organization that refuses to participate in a same-sex marriage . In a statement accompanying the order , he cited a need to \u201c protect against any infringement \u201d of the \u201c right to worship according to \u2018 dictates of conscience \u2019 . \u201d\nUnlike Indiana or Arkansas \u2019 controversial religious freedom bills , which drew fire nationally for broad language that potentially extended to lawsuits between private individuals and businesses , Brownback \u2019 s order specifically dealt with government penalties for those who refuse to recognize gay-wedding ceremonies . The order made direct reference to Obergefell v. Hodges , the Supreme Court \u2019 s gay marriage decision , as an \u201c imposition \u201d that \u201c poses potential infringements on the civil right of religious liberty . \u201d\nAnd in Congress , more than 100 members have followed suit by cosponsoring the First Amendment Defense Act , which would prevent the federal government from revoking the tax-exempt status of religious organizations that do not recognize same-sex marriages . The bill speaks to fears fueled by President Obama \u2019 s own solicitor general , Donald Verrilli , who said during Obergefell \u2019 s oral arguments that non-cooperative religious organizations \u2019 tax-exempt status is \u201c certainly going to be an issue \u201d for the court in the future .\nA number of religious conservatives told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the key to winning these upcoming legislative and legal battles will be employing tactics refined by the same-sex marriage movement that recently defeated them .\n\u201c [ LGBT activists ] did a good job of making the stories of peoples \u2019 lives front and center and saying , \u2018 Look at how these people are affected , \u2019 \u201d said Travis Weber of the Family Research Council . Groups like Freedom to Marry and the Human Rights Campaign used social media to promote popular gay and lesbian celebrities \u2019 viewpoints and encouraged Americans to look to their LGBT neighbors asking for acceptance .\nConservatives should follow suit , Weber said , by highlighting the stories of religious individuals he said had been \u201c demonized , \u201d pointing to businesses like Sweet Cakes by Melissa , an Oregon bakery that was fined $ 135,000 for refusing to bake a wedding wake for a lesbian couple , or the Odgaard family , who shut down their Iowa bistro after a legal battle over their refusal to host a same-sex wedding . These cases , he believes , can serve as the same sort of compelling hook that Justice Kennedy used by putting James Obergefell \u2019 s heartfelt story of losing his husband at the beginning of his decision .\nAnother cue conservative Christians are taking from their Obergefell defeat : Don \u2019 t focus too heavily on gay and lesbian peoples \u2019 sex lives . Instead , focus on religious liberty issues that have nothing to do with the bedroom .\n\u201c When sexual liberty and religious liberty are at odds with each other , in our culture , oftentimes sexual liberty prevails , \u201d Bethancourt said , noting that the same-sex marriage movement was ultimately successful in highlighting families seeking parental rights and access to loved ones in the hospital .\nBethancourt \u2019 s group wrote an amicus brief for the Supreme Court on behalf of a young Muslim woman who was denied a job at Abercrombie and Fitch on the presumption that she would not take off her head scarf during work . The case , he noted , was a clear-cut issue of religious liberty without an alienating sexual component , and it also allowed his movement to partner with other religious groups so that religious liberty arguments were no longer tethered to a particular denomination .\n\u201c People of faith have to stand together , they have to look out for each other , \u201d Bethancourt said .\nAnd there \u2019 s another lesson for religious conservatives : Build a diverse coalition . Bethancourt noted that progressive groups , from the NAACP to the ACLU , successfully expanded the base of support for marriage equality outside of traditional LGBT advocates .\nBut no matter how the Christian right evangelizes and markets itself , many same-sex marriage advocates see it as nothing more than bigotry in sheep \u2019 s clothing .\nThe religious right has employed the \u201c language of apocalyptic impending doom \u201d because \u201c religious leaders realize they \u2019 re losing their base , \u201d said Robertson , who characterized the right \u2019 s narrative as : \u201c We \u2019 ve lost our position of influence in our country , we \u2019 re now a minority , and [ thus ] persecution is coming . \u201d\n\u201c LGBT activists [ were ] saying , \u2018 Treat us the same as everyone else \u2019 for a long period of time , and conservative Christians are [ now ] saying , \u2018 What we want is a carve out so we are exempt from parts of civil law , \u2019 \u201d said Clyde Wilcox , a professor at Georgetown University who wrote \u201c Onward Christian Soldiers : The Christian Right in American Politics . \u201d\nWhether the Christian right succeeds in securing new protections depends largely on how much the American public buys into their stories of persecution , said Michael Moreland , a former White House aide to George W. Bush .\n\u201c Each side is trying to lay claim to the language of discrimination , \u201d which he said is \u201c a very powerful tool \u201d in American politics because it \u2019 s \u201c deeply shaped by the civil rights movement . \u201d\n\u201c Everyone \u2019 s kind of waiting now to see how this plays out . It could play out as race discrimination did , where understandably you had a national consensus come together very quickly about the intolerability of racial segregation , \u201d he said . \u201c Or it could end up being like abortion , where you have a constitutional right but a lot of exemptions , \u201d earned through legal and political fights by a still formidable pro-life movement .\n\u201c A very narrowly crafted religious protections argument can be very successful , \u201d Wilcox said , but overreach like in Indiana will push the public away . \u201c Conservatives need to watch out . \u201d",
