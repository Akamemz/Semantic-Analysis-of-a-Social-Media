His financial ties to Turkish government interests , which paid him $ 530,000 in a lobbying deal that he failed to disclose during the campaign , are also under scrutiny by federal investigators .\nOne major concern for Obama administration officials was the subject of conversations between Flynn and Kislyak that took place shortly after President Barack Obama slapped new sanctions on Russia for meddling in the election .

The US has applied sanctions on Russia since 2014 for its actions in Ukraine .\nFlynn 's calls with Kislyak in December have received the most attention , but his relationship with the Russian ambassador goes back four years .\nHe first met Kislyak in June 2013 during an official trip to Russia , according to The Washington Post .

Trump urged then-FBI Director James Comey in February to drop the bureau 's investigation into Flynn and `` let this go , '' according to a memo Comey wrote at the time . The conversation , first reported by The New York Times earlier this week , has opened the President up to charges from critics of obstruction of justice .\nTrump 's obvious bond with Flynn , like his relationship with Attorney General Jeff Sessions and other top advisers , appears rooted in the fact that they supported his then-longshot presidential campaign last year at a time when most Republicans were ostracizing him .",
