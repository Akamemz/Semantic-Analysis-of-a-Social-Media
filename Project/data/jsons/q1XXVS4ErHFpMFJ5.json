The worst campaigns of 2014\n\nThe 2014 election is being driven by sweeping national forces \u2014 an unpopular president, a shaky economy and, increasingly, national security.\n\nYet for candidates, the fundamentals of running a strong campaign matter as much as ever. And this year, some campaigns are turning out to be doozies \u2014 of the worst variety.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFrom repeated gaffes to destabilizing staff shakeups to unearthed skeletons from the past, all that and more is here in POLITICO\u2019s look at the worst campaigns of 2014:\n\nBruce Braley\n\nIt\u2019s hard to think of a candidate who\u2019s made as many high-profile gaffes as Braley, a Democratic congressman and Iowa Senate hopeful.\n\nIn a radio interview last year, Braley complained about the impact the government shutdown was having on the House gym. \u201cThere\u2019s hardly anybody working down there. There\u2019s no towel service, we\u2019re doing our own laundry down there.\u201d\n\nIn a video of him speaking to a gathering of trial lawyers in Texas, Braley described Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, whom Iowans have elected to the Senate six times, as \u201ca farmer from Iowa who never went to law school, never practiced law.\u201d Braley was warning the group that Grassley is poised to become chairman of the Judiciary Committee if Republicans win the Senate.\n\nFinally, while marching in a parade in July, Braley was caught on video appearing to say that he\u2019s a farmer \u2014 even though there\u2019s no evidence to suggest he is. (Braley\u2019s campaign says he made the remark after mishearing what a parade-goer was asking him.)\n\nBraley has also had to deal with a series of unflattering stories detailing a nasty dispute between his wife and a neighbor whose chickens invaded the Braleys\u2019 yard.\n\nIt\u2019s all given Republicans ammunition to brand Braley as out of touch.

Tom Harkin has held for three decades, in essentially a tied race.\n\nEric Cantor\n\nCantor\u2019s blowout primary loss to an obscure college professor, Dave Brat, came as a complete shock to just about everyone.\n\nBut in retrospect, maybe it shouldn\u2019t have.\n\nFrom start to finish, Cantor ran a lackadaisical, messy campaign. He ignored key conservative groups that ultimately threw their support to Brat, lost his control over the local Republican Party machinery and spent little time campaigning in the district.
