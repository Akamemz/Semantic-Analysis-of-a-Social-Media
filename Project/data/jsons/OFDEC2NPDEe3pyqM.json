It came on a street in Ferguson , Mo. , as she stood next to a petrified eighth-grader .\n`` I was afraid of sounding like an angry black woman at the White House , '' says Packnett , one of several young civil rights activists in the meeting . `` But I needed the president to know what middle-schoolers faced in their neighborhood . ''\nSo she spoke up \u2014 sustained , she says , on this and other recent occasions by words of Martin Luther King Jr. : `` Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere . ''\nThat 's from Letter from Birmingham Jail , written at a time when King , facing defeat in his desegregation campaign , risked sending the civil rights movement 's children out against police dogs and fire hoses . The nation was stunned ; the bet paid off .\nMartin Luther King Day 2015 coincides with the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act and the release of Selma , a film about King 's perilous march in support of the bill . The holiday also comes after months of protests around the nation over police killings of black men in Ferguson , Mo. , New York City and elsewhere .\nThe protest movement that formed after the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner , summed up by the hashtag # BlackLivesMatter , includes a new generation of young civil rights activists .\nOne is Packnett , 30 , a St. Louis education administrator who helped organize Ferguson protests and sits on a commission appointed by Missouri Gov . Jay Nixon to address social and economic conditions highlighted by protests .\nHer parents were preachers who made the 1987 civil rights movement documentary Eyes on the Prize required viewing for their kids . When Packnett went to college , she majored in African-American history and learned more of the story .\nThe Rev . Martin Luther King Jr. waves to the crowd gathered at the Lincoln Memorial for his `` I Have a Dream '' speech during the March on Washington on Aug. 28 , 1963 .\nHer generation came up after creation of the King federal holiday . They listened to recordings of King 's speeches and recited the words . They watched his march on Washington . They marveled at how he stood up to segregationist brutes like Bull Connor and Jim Clark , and to the men in the Oval Office . They rolled their eyes at his dark suit , white shirt and tie .\nThese young civil rights activists are n't like traditional leaders and do n't see themselves as such . They have more in common with the Occupy movement than with the NAACP or King 's Southern Christian Leadership Conference .\nThey generally respect and sometimes revere King . But most do n't see him as a model to be copied or his movement as a template \u2014 not the oratory , the top-down organization or the on-your-sleeve Christianity . They take some things from their illustrious predecessor , and leave others .\nRasheen Aldridge , far left , listens to President Obama , far right , at the conclusion of a meeting with New York Mayor Bill de Blasio , second from left , Philadelphia Police Department Commissioner Charles Ramsey and other elected officials on Dec. 1 , 2014 , in Washington .\nPhillip Agnew , 29 , director of the Florida-based Dream Defenders , a group founded after the shooting death of Trayvon Martin , an unarmed black teenager . Agnew , like Packnett , attended the White House civil rights summit in December .\nRasheen Aldridge , 20 , a St. Louis fast food worker and member of Missouri 's Ferguson Commission . He also attended the White House conference , which came three days after a confrontation with police at a demonstration for which he was charged with assault .\nDeRay McKesson , 29 , a Minneapolis schools human relations executive who went to Ferguson after Brown 's death in August and , via social media , became a prolific and influential commenter on police brutality and civil rights . His Twitter following has increased from 900 to 63,000 .\nCarmen Perez , 37 , an activist prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of singer Harry Belafonte , who helped form Justice League NYC , which organized protests after a grand jury failed to indict a police officer in Garner 's chokehold death . It 's co-hosting a # Dream4Justice march Monday , with King 's face on its Web page .\nThere 's the Rev . William Barber II , 50 , president of the North Carolina NAACP . He helped start `` Moral Mondays '' demonstrations to protest state policies in areas such as Medicaid , abortion and voting rights , the minimum wage , public education and criminal justice reform , at which hundreds have been arrested .\nAnd there 's 23-year-old Wazi Maret Davis of Oakland , who came up with the idea for `` Black Brunch , '' wherein protesters enter a restaurant unannounced , recite the names of people killed by police and ask diners to stand in support .\n\u201c This ai n't your grandparents ' civil rights movement. \u201d Tef Poe , rapper\nBut the times have produced no one to compare to King , a peerless orator , skillful diplomat , shrewd strategist , original thinker , tenacious negotiator , international celebrity and Nobel Peace laureate whose tactics ranged from litigation to boycott to civil disobedience .\nHe was 26 when he led the Montgomery bus boycott , and 34 when he delivered his `` I Have a Dream '' speech .\n`` There 's no one iconic leader now , '' says Peniel Joseph , director of Tufts University 's Center for the Study of Race and Democracy . `` Instead you have thousands of young people who brought other people into the street . They 're Millennials ( born around the turn of the century or in the two previous decades ) . They did n't come through a conventional civil rights organization . ''\nAs the rapper Tef Poe put it at a St. Louis rally : `` This ai n't your grandparents ' civil rights movement . ''\nAnd this MLK Day will be different , too . In years past , the holiday has been observed in Philadelphia with a day of service . This year , there also will be a march to protest policing , including the `` stop and frisk '' tactic that allegedly targets young black men .\nTo the Rev . Mark Tyler , 48 , a march organizer who says he was tear-gassed in Ferguson , protest fits the occasion : `` King was not killed because of his charity work . He was killed because of his challenge to the status quo . ''\nBut how relevant is King when protests are spontaneous and leaders are anonymous , when agendas are vague or non-existent , when all have a voice through Twitter , when planning may not go beyond the next rally ?\nDemonstrators , including Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. , stream over an Alabama River bridge at the city limits of Selma , Ala. , on March 10 , 1965 .\nThat depends which King you 're talking about ; the new activists see many with whom to identify .\nThe radical . This `` late '' King \u2014 in the period after the one depicted in Selma \u2013 opposed the Vietnam War , moved against de facto segregation outside the South and was planning a `` Poor People 's Campaign '' of massive civil disobedience in Washington to protest economic inequality .\nThe diplomat . His ability to forge coalitions is specially prized now , when the difference between a successful protest and a bust depends on mobilizing not just the members of one group , but also many disparate ones .\nThe provocateur . Packnett says King 's willingness to confront , coerce and consequently enrage opponents has been downplayed , and King often made to seem like a passive dreamer `` singing Kumbaya . ''\nThe internationalist . His ability to elicit support from abroad \u2013 and shame Americans with segregation 's inherent contradictions -- resonates with Agnew , who recently traveled to Palestine with other activists .\nThe grass roots activist . Despite his national reputation and focus , King seized on local issues and worked through local leaders , such as the Rev . Fred Shuttlesworth in Birmingham . `` King 's style was local campaigns with national impact , '' says Agnew . `` That 's what we 're seeing with Ferguson and New York . ''\nThe believer . He did n't lose sight of what was right because of expedience or politics \u2014 especially partisan politics , which many activists see as a trap . McKesson says King 's strength through many trials stemmed from `` a calmness that was founded in rectitude . ''\nIn addition to these identities , the new activists also admire some of King 's qualities .\nCourage . Activists today know they could have been killed in King 's day , and King himself was arrested about 30 times . Justin Hansford , a St. Louis University Law School professor , was arrested while serving as a legal adviser at a protest in a Walmart last year . He had never seen the inside of a jail cell , `` even on a field trip . ''\nIndependence . King refused to kowtow in the Oval Office . He ignored President Kennedy 's opposition to the March on Washington in 1963 , and broke with President Johnson in 1967 to oppose the Vietnam War .\nFortitude . King persisted despite death threats , jailings , FBI wiretaps and delays \u2014 the civil rights bill sat in Congress for years . `` He did n't worry about time , '' says Aldridge , who tends to . `` He thought time was on his side , because he was in the right . ' '' \u200b\nThere are ways in which King seems less instructive these days .\nSocial media have lessened the need for a single great voice . `` The message can be bigger , quicker , faster , '' says Agnew , and can assemble a crowd in hours instead of days or weeks . `` We still need brilliant communicators , but they can be artists , musicians , writers . ''\nDream Defenders Executive Director Phillip Agnew , left , listens as Florida Gov . Rick Scott speaks in the Capitol in Tallahassee , Fla. , in July 2013 .\nAgnew and his allies also see an advantage in many leaders rather than one . It 's harder to cripple a movement by cutting off its head , as many believe happened when King was assassinated in 1968 . `` You ca n't kill all of us , '' says Hansford .\nAnother advantage to the new model : `` If you did n't relate to King , you did n't relate to the movement , '' says McKesson . `` Now , if you do n't relate to me on Twitter , you can relate to the movement through someone else . ''\nWhat 's more , the activists see King 's movement as one that discriminated against women and prized hierarchy over spontaneity . Ideas came from the top down , not bottom up .\nAnd despite King 's ties to grass-roots activists , he essentially parachuted into places such as Birmingham to lend his voice and prestige at key moments . Some on the ground resentfully called him `` de Lawd . ''\nBut some critics compare the new movement unfavorably to King 's .\n\u201c [ T ] he generation before us ...
