That \u2019 s the workmanlike , sexy Bible salesman uniform of \u201c Mayor Pete , \u201d candidate for president and ( at the time of writing ) maybe-perhaps-looking-likely winner of the Iowa caucuses .\nWhether or not Pete Buttigieg is finally counted as the winner in Iowa\u2014if so it would make him the first LGBTQ candidate to win a state contest in a presidential primary\u2014and whatever you think of him ( and LGBTQ voters are not one uniform bloc of support ; many support other candidates ) , what he is doing as a gay man is of history-making note .\nHe is running for president against a notably homophobic president and administration , and\u2014right now , in his bit of the contest\u2014he \u2019 s winning , rising , and creating a memorable public silhouette . We are so used to the well-practiced , perfectly correct argument of \u201c There \u2019 s more to Pete Buttigieg than being gay , \u201d that we can gloss over the monumental , very gay achievement of Pete Buttigieg .\nWherever his campaign goes from here , Iowa represents a pivotal moment in not just simple political terms , but also about what the prospect of a Buttigieg presidency means for and to LGBTQ America : It shows something about how far we have come , and how far we still have to go .\nIf you think America is just dandy with LGBTQ people , watch a stark and revealing video shot on Monday night , involving an Iowa caucus-goer shocked to discover\u2014 from a precinct captain named Nikki van den Heever\u2014that Buttigieg , the candidate she was set to support , was married to his male partner .\n\u201c Then I don \u2019 t want anybody like that in the White House , \u201d the woman says .\nThe exchange is fascinating , not just for the woman \u2019 s entrenched bigotry , but also van den Heever \u2019 s valiant , graceful patience and reasoned , sadly futile argument that why should it matter that Buttigieg is gay ; he \u2019 s the candidate the woman had gravitated to be cause of his policies and what he had been saying .\nThe woman is not to be moved . We hear old familiars about what the Bible says , and now that she knows Buttigieg is gay everything else goes \u201c straight down the toilet . \u201d\nShe is one voice . One of the most striking results of the Iowa Caucuses\u2014so far\u2014is the victory of Buttigieg in rural areas of the state . If the expectation was that an out-gay candidate for president could only win in metropolitan areas but not the countryside , Buttigieg just shattered that preconception .\nIf it \u2019 s a matter of long and tortured debate about how radical an LGBTQ person Buttigieg is or isn \u2019 t\u2014whether he is \u201c gay enough \u201d as once chewed over\u2014then perhaps it can be agreed he is currently taking one of the most radical , visible public stands as an LGBTQ person in this country .\nObserve his most recent stump speech , alluding to the validation his possible Iowa victory might offer to the young person wondering if \u201c he , she , or they \u201d belong in their own families . Gay enough for you ?\nLGBTQ people are tough on ourselves and tough on our peers . We come out and form identities in many challenging contexts . We argue outwards and inwards , and with each other fiercely . It \u2019 s how our movement has advanced .\n\u201c Under an administration that attacks LGBTQ rights , and trans people in particular , for many identity politics seem vital . Buttigieg , meanwhile , seems determined to traverse labels and divides\u2014even if he has yet to show how he can attract black voters , whose support he needs \u201d\nSo , to one kind of LGBTQ person , Buttigieg is a cheer-producing inspiration ; to another he is a well-educated , white , privileged gay man , palatable for the American mainstream , but not the radical and reforming candidate they see in Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders .\nYou might say it says a lot about social progress that the LGBTQ candidate doesn \u2018 t automatically get the LGBTQ vote ; that Buttigieg \u2018 s candidacy shows that LGBTQ voters are as varied , and as picky , as straight , and that they feel they can and should vote for a candidate for a bunch of reasons , not simply their shared LGBTQ identity .\nThe issue of LGBTQ rights in the election campaign is just as tricky . Democrat strategists worry about identity politics on the left , fracturing electability chances . But they also provide a galvanizing focus against an administration that attacks LGBTQ rights , and trans people in particular . Buttigieg , meanwhile , seems determined to traverse labels and divides\u2014even if he has yet to show how he can attract black voters , whose support he needs .\nButtigieg has been praised for making history , praised ( alongside his charismatic , witty husband Chasten ) for being not just public about his relationship but vocal too . Surely they both deserve credit for how they have done this . Buttigieg speaks not just about his love for Chasten , their commitment together , but also his sexuality and what it means to him ; his own journey to openness and self-acceptance .\nButtigieg also places these things in a wider context of family , faith , and community . This is where he has proven most radical and refreshing on a public stage ; he is not going to let the likes of the evangelical right co-opt faith for their own prejudiced ends . Buttigieg is a gay man of faith , and proud of it\u2014and brilliantly eloquent when speaking about it .\nAll those who complain he is not radical or queer enough should listen to Buttigieg speak about the many-shaded nature of his gay journey and identity . It \u2019 s a pretty radical story to launch into the mainstream , and it is clearly , honestly told . His life experiences transcend boundaries .\nThis plainness of tone may also explain elements of rural , conservative support . Imagine Buttigieg as a confounding Venn diagram , combining all kinds of social and cultural elements we are used to imagining in conflict .\n\u201c Buttigieg is a challenge\u2014and a bracing , welcome one at that\u2014for all kinds of conservative and liberal orthodoxies \u201d\nHis candidacy does not just challenge straight America , it also challenges LGBTQ America too , from the familiar boxes we put ourselves in to the familiar corners we have fought so hard from . Buttigieg is a challenge\u2014and a bracing , welcome one at that\u2014for all kinds of conservative and liberal orthodoxies .\nWhat does Buttigieg \u2019 s ascendancy in this Middle American state tell us about LGBTQ political and cultural progress ? What optimism and what , if any , caution should we extrapolate from it ? LGBTQ people are used to totemic moments\u2014the first same-sex kiss in a mainstream movie ; the first time a same-sex person achieved such and such\u2014and we celebrate them .\nAnd yet , we are also aware , and worry the public really isn \u2019 t aware , that these moments don \u2019 t mean legal equality . They don \u2019 t protect us\u2014particularly marginalized groups within our community , like trans women of color\u2014from violence and murder . Bigotry continues , legalized discrimination continues , no matter how big our Pride parades become .\nYes , we know that guy on your favorite show is gay , we know you love Drag Race . Great ! But right now , the Supreme Court is actually considering whether it should be OK , as the Trump administration is arguing , to fire someone simply on the grounds of their sexual orientation or gender identity .\nLGBTQ people are used to living in these weird weather systems\u2014 \u201c Yay Mayor Pete , the country is changing ! \u201d alongside \u201c Why are our rights not protected in this country ? \u201d These subjects are rarely covered on the mainstream news . Looking to Buttigieg , liberal America is congratulating itself on how far it has come , just as the country \u2019 s LGBTQ population knows it is under vicious legislative attack .\nIf you \u2019 re LGBTQ right now , and watching Buttigieg \u2019 s ascendency take shape , your heart may be leaping at the possibility . Can he , you wonder . Then you worry ; LGBTQ life in America in 2020 means\u2014alongside all the welcome progress\u2014a land of a multitude of anti-trans bills in state legislatures , which are not getting half the publicity of Mayor Pete ; a land of \u201c religious freedom \u201d bills and legal challenges that aim to diminish LGBTQ rights ; and a land under the rule President Donald Trump and his homophobic Vice President Mike Pence , doing all they can to marginalize and demonize LGBTQ people .\nMayor Pete \u2019 s progress stands in stark contrast to Trump and his compadres \u2019 sewage pipe of bigotry and prejudice .\nAnd so , LGBTQ people also worry , because\u2014even though it \u2019 s 2020 , and aren \u2019 t we beyond it ? \u2014what kind of homophobia and gay-baiting , overt and subliminal , will Buttigieg have to put up with if he eventually becomes the Democratic nominee ? Will that make him \u201c gay enough \u201d for his LGBTQ detractors ?\nMore prosaically , as the Iowa Caucus video above shows , the prejudice is out there , even if it can seem mostly buried and unspoken . It is ready to be activated by Trump and Pence and their evangelical and conservative supporters . The conflict on the video is conducted civilly , far more so than we are used to\u2014and what one can expect in the far more vicious atmosphere of a general election campaign .\nWe see van den Heever \u2019 s Christianity\u2014open-hearted and minded\u2014versus the woman \u2019 s , which is narrow and judgmental .
