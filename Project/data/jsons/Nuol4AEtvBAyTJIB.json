    "content": "In Monday \u2019 s presidential debate , Hillary Clinton wrapped up with some parting shots at Donald Trump for his degrading statements toward women . For Hillary , it was low-hanging fruit . If looking to smack-down Donald Trump for an offensive statement or two toward women , the options are vast , a veritable harvest of rich opportunities . Reach into the grab-bag and pick your poison .\nFor his part , Trump played the unlikely role of gentleman . Rather than excoriating his debate opponent \u2014 as he did freely , wantonly , brutally , to the likes of Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio \u2014 Trump this time chose not to jump into the gutter . As Ted Cruz had learned , and as Ted Cruz \u2019 s wife Heidi had learned , no one can sling it like Trump \u2014 anytime , anyplace .\nI suspected this might happen . In fact , I began writing about it here months ago , way back in February , predicting that the bad-boy would magically become nice-boy to Madame Hillary , when his opponent was no longer Cruz or Rubio . Now he \u2019 s suddenly playing nice ?\n\u201c I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary , to her family , \u201d said Trump near the end of the debate , \u201c and I said to myself , \u2018 I can \u2019 t do it . I just can \u2019 t do it . It \u2019 s inappropriate . It \u2019 s not nice . \u2019 \u201d\nInappropriate ? Not nice ? Since when does Donald Trump care about that ? He wasn \u2019 t nice to \u201c Lyin \u2019 Ted \u201d and his wife and his dad , to \u201c choking \u201d Marco , to \u201c ugly \u201d Carly , to \u201c loser \u201d Jeb , to that surrender-monkey John McCain , to WMD-lying George W. Bush , to Scott Walker , to Susana Martinez , to John Kasich , to Mitt Romney , and on and on . Now he \u2019 s a delightful chap to Hillary ? Where was this sense of measured restraint against our people ?\nI remember listening to Rush Limbaugh one day back in May , when Ted Cruz dropped out of the race after Indiana , followed by John Kasich . Donald Trump was thus the presumptive nominee , what I called a catastrophe for the future of the conservative movement . To accommodate Trump \u2019 s candidacy , Rush had taken a two-semester sabbatical from his chair at his School of Advanced Conservative Studies . He suddenly seemed unfazed and unconcerned about whether the Republican nominee was carrying a flag for conservatism , or even knew what it was .\nInstead , that sad afternoon in May , Rush was reveling in joy , savoring the Trump-Hillary spectacle to come . Rush said that he couldn \u2019 t wait to watch Trump destroy Hillary , rip her to shreds , blow her to smithereens , flatten her , finally see her get her comeuppance . This would be \u201c orgasmic \u201d to watch , assured Rush .\nWell , Rush , how did it feel on Monday night ? Were you satisfied ? Your guy dealt with Hillary with kid-gloves , not a stick of dynamite .\n\u201c I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary , to her family , and I said to myself , \u2018 I can \u2019 t do it . I just can \u2019 t do it . It \u2019 s inappropriate . It \u2019 s not nice . \u2019 \u201d\nClearly , this was a tactical shift by Trump and his campaign . It was an obvious attempt to change his tone for a larger audience , to try to salvage some semblance of the married-female vote . The fact that he spent a year laying waste to the reputations , characters , and political careers of the best and brightest in the future of the conservative movement and Republican Party was now a moot point , I guess . ( Oh , well . ) The Trump tornado took them down , but now the wolf retreated to the woods . The wolf was replaced Monday night by a kinder , gentler Trump , a lovable lamb \u2014 now that the target in the debate is Hillary .\nBut alas , I ask Mr. Trump : why not ? Why not blurt out something \u201c rough \u201d to Hillary and \u201c her family \u201d ? Why let Hillary and Bill off the hook ?\nThe public should be reminded just how bad the Clinton White House was in the 1990s . That \u2019 s clearly what Trump was thinking \u2014 namely , how Bill Clinton treated women , how Hillary either looked the other way , enabled her husband \u2019 s behavior , helped cover it up , or surely on occasion even joined the Carville cabal in smearing Bill \u2019 s ( rightful ) accusers . Bill had turned the White House into Animal House .\nSince Trump was unwilling to say it on Monday night , I \u2019 ll briefly summarize what I wrote here recently . I \u2019 ll remind everyone of what erupted on the national scene precisely this time 18 years ago , September 1998 , when explicit details were released regarding President Bill Clinton \u2019 s scandalous escapades with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky . They are sordid details that are painfully graphic but worth remembering .\n\u201c The first sexual encounter took place late in a day in which Mr. Clinton signed a \u2018 Family Week \u2019 proclamation , \u201d reported the New York Times in September 1998 . \u201c He saw Ms. Lewinsky working alone in an aide \u2019 s office , invited her into the Oval Office and began with a kiss . \u201d\nIt began there . Family Week at the Clinton White House .\nThe actual scandal had broken much earlier , at the start of the year . In January 1998 , word first broke that the 42nd president was guilty of a physical relationship with no less than a White House intern .\nOf course , Bill Clinton denied it categorically . He always did . On January 26 , 1998 , he stood before the press , bit his lip , and earnestly insisted , \u201c I did not have sexual relations with that woman , Miss Lewinsky . \u201d\nThe next day , Hillary Clinton stepped up to assume her well-rehearsed role of yet again protecting Bill from charges of unbecoming sexual conduct , as she had done in her infamous 60 Minutes appearance during the 1992 campaign , a crucial move in Bill \u2019 s path to securing the presidency . On January 27 , 1998 , she told NBC News that there was a \u201c vast right-wing conspiracy \u201d out to get her husband \u2014 one that included this august publication , The \u2588\u2588\u2588\nIt was classic Hillary Clinton . But this time , it didn \u2019 t work . This time , Bill \u2019 s bluff was called . The FBI did tests on semen stains on a blue dress worn by the college girl during one of her moments with the president in the Oval Office . The DNA matched . The evidence confirmed the presidential sexual act .\nBill Clinton could not fib his way out of that one .\nThe avalanche , however , was just beginning . In September 1998 , the Starr Report was released , accompanied by numerous media reports from reporters doing their own digging . Here is what was learned :\nThere had been 18 months of gifts and at least a half-dozen intimate encounters between Bill and Monica from 1995 to 1997 , including while the president of the United States was on the phone conducting the business of the state . One such moment occurred Easter Sunday 1996 . Another occurred with Bill using a favorite cigar on Monica as a sexual instrument . They transpired during the peak of Bill Clinton \u2019 s reelection campaign .\nThere was much more . The full details are outrageous . They are literally pornographic .\nTo this day , I \u2019 m flatly amazed that no one ever walked in on Bill and Monica . ( Someone must have . ) How did Bill get away with it ? Was POTUS locking the doors to keep out his staff while he had his way with his play-thing ? Where was the secret service ? The secretaries ? The maids ? The janitors ?\nAll of this was brazen , politically and personally . They smack of a man who was not new to this kind of thing .\nMillions of Americans learned this and still more . Monica laughingly told Barbara Walters about the \u201c phone sex \u201d she enjoyed with the commander-in-chief . She also told Barbara that her presidential boyfriend had confided in her that he \u201c might be alone in three years , \u201d referring to the prospects of Hillary dumping him .
