    "content": "Was Hillary Clinton just rusty in her interview with Diane Sawyer on Monday ? Still by Martin H. Simon/ABC\nIt \u2019 s not the empathy , it \u2019 s the honesty . Hillary Clinton told Diane Sawyer that she and her husband were \u201c dead broke \u201d when they left the White House . The remark caused something between a flap and a stir . It might even have qualified as a ruckus . The Republican National Committee said it showed that Clinton was \u201c out of touch \u201d ( the go-to charge in the age of the Great Recession and its aftermath ) . The next day , Good Morning America \u2019 s Robin Roberts asked whether Clinton had regrets about how she characterized her financial straits given that so many people are actually struggling . Clinton replied , \u201c Let me just clarify that I fully appreciate how hard life is for so many Americans today . It \u2019 s an issue that I \u2019 ve worked hard on and cared about my entire adult life . \u201d\nHillary Clinton , the once and future candidate , should hope that people see this as an issue of whether she empathizes with regular Americans . That kind of problem she could handle . The bigger challenge for her as a candidate is that this inartful statement could start the slow erosion of voters \u2019 opinions of Clinton \u2019 s honesty . That \u2019 s what happened in 2008 , and it \u2019 s a harder problem to fix , especially when you are engaged in a political enterprise where honesty is already as pliable as a chicken bone .\nIt is technically true that Clinton was broke when she came out of the White House . The Clintons had no cushion from a previous lucrative life in the private sector , and they had mountains of legal bills from their court fights . But the Clintons were not unlike the couple with the winning Powerball ticket : broke at the moment but with the promise of significant riches ahead . Clinton had signed an $ 8 million book deal ( for her previous book ) . Before leaving the White House they bought a $ 3 million Washington home and a nearly $ 2 million home in Chappaqua , New York . She and her husband have profited nicely from their experience in public service , mainly from public speaking and headlining big events . Would that we could all be struck dead with this kind of penury .\nDoes Clinton feel your pain ? If Hillary Clinton gets caught in the empathy trap , it \u2019 s her husband \u2019 s fault . He elevated fellow-feeling to the high place it now has in presidential campaign politics in his race against President George Bush in 1992 . It \u2019 s deadly to get caught out of touch , but Hillary Clinton has plenty of time to find her way to the right side of the economic empathy issue . She \u2019 s already been trying , talking about income inequality , student loan debt , and the middle-class squeeze .
