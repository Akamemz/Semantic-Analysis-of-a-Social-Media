    "content": "This week , the Supreme Court agreed to hear a lawsuit filed by conservative activists in Texas that could redefine the principle of \u201c one person , one vote \u201d as we know it . And if the Court sides with the plaintiffs , Republicans could stretch their already-historic majorities in the House and state legislatures even wider \u2014 the GOP would be helped just slightly in presidential elections .\nIs Congress \u2019 s job to represent people , or just voters ? Currently , all states are required to redraw their political boundaries based on the Census \u2019 s official count of total population every 10 years , which includes minors and noncitizen immigrants . But the Texas plaintiffs argue that states should be allowed to apportion seats based on where only U.S. citizens over 18 years of age live .\nIt seems like a minor detail , but it \u2019 s actually a major distinction . The decennial Census doesn \u2019 t track citizenship data , but the Census \u2019 s American Community Survey does . And although all 435 U.S. congressional districts have roughly equal total populations , the number of eligible voters and rates of actual participation can vary wildly from place to place .\nFor example , in Florida \u2019 s 11th District , home to the largely white retirement mecca of The Villages , 81 percent of all residents are adult citizens . But in California \u2019 s heavily Latino 34th District , anchored by downtown Los Angeles , only 41 percent of all residents are eligible to vote . The variations across districts in terms of actual turnout can be even more eye-popping . According to results compiled by Polidata for the Cook Political Report , Montana \u2019 s lone House district cast 483,932 votes for president in 2012 , more than four times the tally in Texas \u2019 s 29th District , 114,901 .\nA move toward counting only eligible voters , as logistically difficult as it may be , would drastically shift political power away from the urban environs with minorities and noncitizens , and toward whiter areas with larger native-born populations . That \u2019 s bad news for Democrats : Of the 50 congressional districts with the lowest shares of eligible voters , 41 are occupied by Democrats ( nearly all are Latino-majority seats ) . Meanwhile , of the 50 districts with the highest shares of eligible voters , 38 are represented by the GOP .\nMost legal scholars are skeptical that this case will change the way House seats and Electoral College votes are apportioned to states every 10 years ; after all , the Constitution pretty clearly references the role of the Census \u2019 s population count in this process .\nBut let \u2019 s lay out a hypothetical for a minute . What would happen if counts of voters rather than people were used for both reapportionment ( allotting seats among the states ) and redistricting ( drawing boundaries within states ) ? States with large Latino populations would be penalized . Based on the 2013 ACS data , California would lose six House seats , Texas would lose four and New York one , while a smattering of other states would each gain one seat .\nNext , the partisan implications : Which party would gain or lose those seats ? To arrive at an estimate , we calculated the percentage of eligible voters currently living in districts represented by Democrats and Republicans in each state and applied that percentage to the \u201c new \u201d seat total . For example , Republicans currently represent 25 of Texas \u2019 s 36 districts ( 69 percent ) , but an even higher share ( 73 percent ) of Texas \u2019 s eligible voters . If Texas lost four seats and only adult citizens were counted , the GOP seat edge might expand to 24-8 .\nIf we repeat this calculation across all states , a redistribution of representation based on eligible voters could result in a net gain of roughly eight seats for House Republicans , who are already sitting on a historically large majority of 245 seats .\nCURRENT SEATS HYPOTHETICAL STATE GOP DEM GOP DEM GOP GAIN Alabama 6 1 6 1 \u2013 Alaska 1 0 1 0 \u2013 Arizona 5 4 5 4 \u2013 Arkansas 4 0 4 0 \u2013 California 14 39 13 34 +4 Colorado 4 3 4 3 \u2013 Connecticut 0 5 0 5 \u2013 Delaware 0 1 0 1 \u2013 Florida 17 10 17 10 \u2013 Georgia 10 4 10 4 \u2013 Hawaii 0 2 0 2 \u2013 Idaho 2 0 2 0 \u2013 Illinois 8 10 8 10 \u2013 Indiana 7 2 7 2 \u2013 Iowa 3 1 4 1 +1 Kansas 4 0 4 0 \u2013 Kentucky 5 1 6 1 +1 Louisiana 5 1 6 1 +1 Maine 1 1 1 1 \u2013 Maryland 1 7 1 7 \u2013 Massachusetts 0 9 0 9 \u2013 Michigan 9 5 10 5 +1 Minnesota 3 5 3 5 \u2013 Mississippi 3 1 3 1 \u2013 Missouri 6 2 7 2 +1 Montana 1 0 2 0 +1 Nebraska 2 1 2 1 \u2013 Nevada 3 1 3 1 \u2013 New Hampshire 1 1 1 1 \u2013 New Jersey 6 6 6 6 \u2013 New Mexico 1 2 1 2 \u2013 New York 9 18 9 17 +1 North Carolina 10 3 11 3 +1 North Dakota 1 0 1 0 \u2013 Ohio 12 4 13 4 +1 Oklahoma 5 0 5 0 \u2013 Oregon 1 4 1 5 -1 Pennsylvania 13 5 14 5 +1 Rhode Island 0 2 0 2 \u2013 South Carolina 6 1 6 1 \u2013 South Dakota 1 0 1 0 \u2013 Tennessee 7 2 7 2 \u2013 Texas 25 11 24 8 +2 Utah 4 0 4 0 \u2013 Vermont 0 1 0 1 \u2013 Virginia 8 3 9 3 +1 Washington 4 6 4 6 \u2013 West Virginia 3 0 3 0 \u2013 Wisconsin 5 3 5 3 \u2013 Wyoming 1 0 1 0 \u2013 Total 247 188 255 180 +16\nWhat \u2019 s interesting , however , is that the possible shift would affect only the closest of presidential elections . If you were to replay the 2012 election under the new lines , President Obama would win 331 electoral votes , only one fewer than he actually did .\nHow is that possible , given that Republicans would pick up a number of House seats and the number of a state \u2019 s electoral votes is highly dependent on its number of House seats ?\nMany of the districts Republicans would gain are in states Obama won . Iowa , Michigan , Ohio , Pennsylvania and Virginia all went for Obama thanks to his strength in the cities , but they lean Republican on the congressional district level , in part because Republican voters are more evenly distributed throughout the state . Obama would have gained five electoral votes from these states thanks to eligible voter reappointment .\nIn an ironic twist , Republican presidential candidates would be hurt most in Texas . Even though the state is losing districts that have a lot of Hispanics and lean Democratic , the state overall is heavily Republican . Instead of contributing a pretty much guaranteed 38 electoral votes to a Republican presidential candidate , Texas would deliver only 34 electoral votes .\nThat doesn \u2019 t mean Republicans would completely strike out on the presidential level in reapportionment . Democrats would lose six electoral votes from California and one from New York . Republicans would gain in the fairly safe Republican states of Kentucky , Missouri and Montana , as well as the Republican-leaning state of North Carolina . But these changes are mostly canceled out by the aforementioned ones .\nRepublicans would , however , seem to have a better chance of winning the presidency in a very close election . If all states were shifted by 3.9 percentage points from their 2012 result to create a tie in the national vote , Democrats would still win 272 electoral votes under the current lines . For Republicans to win the Electoral College , it would take a shift of 5.4 percentage points nationally .\nUnder the reapportioned lines , a 3.9 percentage point shift from the 2012 result would create a tie in the Electoral College . Republicans would win all the states they did in 2012 plus Florida , Ohio and Virginia ( barely ) . In the event of an Electoral College tie , the House of Representatives , where Republicans hold a clear edge in House delegations by state , would decide the election . Hence , a Republican would be more likely to be elected president .\nDemocrats are privately confident that the Supreme Court will rule against the conservative plaintiffs , and they better be right if they want to maintain the position they have in House and presidential elections .\nUPDATE ( May 29 , 7:53 p.m. ) : Rick Hasen , an election law professor at the University of California , Irvine , pointed out that the original headline on this article gave the impression this case was likely to change the apportionment of House seats and Electoral College votes .
