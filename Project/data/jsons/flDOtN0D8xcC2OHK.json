    "content": "It \u2019 s been a year since teenage Swedish climate protester Greta Thunberg began her solitary school strike outside the Parliament building in Stockholm . The New Yorker \u2019 s Masha Gessen profiled her in October 2018 , and that \u2019 s when I first heard of her : her trademark braids framing a round face , her depression and Asperger \u2019 s diagnoses , how she \u2019 d convinced her opera-singer mom to stop flying and her family to go \u201c mostly \u201d vegan . Since last fall , she \u2019 s given several unrelenting speeches excoriating powerful adults ( at Davos , at the United Nations \u2019 COP24 climate talks , in the British Parliament ) , been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize , and fueled a new wave of teenage climate activism . She \u2019 s also become a major target of the global right wing\u2014a sign , perhaps , that what she \u2019 s doing is working .\nBut even as I \u2019 ve watched her rise , and felt personally inspired by her message , I haven \u2019 t been able to figure one thing out . Why has Thunberg been able to break through and become a catalyzing figure , when other young people have been pursuing climate activism ? Why was it Greta who had her face made into a 50-foot mural on the side of a building in Britain ? Why , for example , didn \u2019 t the plaintiffs in Juliana v. the United States , a 2015 lawsuit filed against the American government for its failure to ward off a future of climate chaos , become media darlings ? Is it because , as Thunberg \u2019 s critics continuously suggest , the left loves a victim\u2014especially ( I might add ) one who \u2019 s also an adorable Scandinavian in braids ? Or were we simply ready , in 2019 , to hear somebody be as blunt and urgent as we sometimes feel , about this huge problem we \u2019 ve been mostly ignoring ?\nShe neatly refuses to participate in a common dynamic around children \u2019 s environmental activism , where grown-ups respond to young environmentalists by condescending to them .\nFor one thing , Thunberg \u2019 s history with climate depression\u2014she has described these feelings as having been , at one point in time , debilitating\u2014is familiar to a lot of people . It \u2019 s a part of her story that the global right uses to discredit her ( saying she \u2019 s \u201c deeply disturbed \u201d ) . Yet this narrative of being paralyzed by climate fears , before discovering that activism could be an outlet for them , is one of the biggest sources of her appeal . If you are a person in the United States who is not yet directly affected by climate-stoked storms or fires or drought but who accepts the scientific consensus and follows the news , you have possibly experienced a pattern of climate anxiety that looks something like mine\u2014occasional four-hour panics when I think we are doomed fools living through the last good time , bracketed by longer periods when denial allows me to conduct the business of daily life . Perhaps because of her age , or perhaps because of the way her brain works , Thunberg doesn \u2019 t get those soothing periods of denial . She experiences only the intense dread . In her speeches , she channels that fact , recalling to sympathetic listeners the urgency of their own 3 a.m. fears . I think her approach is working on us because Thunberg \u2019 s climate depression isn \u2019 t an aberration\u2014it \u2019 s an increasingly common collective sentiment .\nAnother part of Thunberg \u2019 s appeal : She doesn \u2019 t allow adult leaders to buy her off with promises , sweet words , or decorations . She neatly refuses to participate in a common dynamic around children \u2019 s environmental activism , where grown-ups respond to young environmentalists by condescending to them\u2014poster contests , token inclusion in decision-making , TV shows and plastic toys aimed at \u201c nature-loving \u201d kids . Too easily , kids \u2019 environmental instincts seem to get diverted into small projects they can do to \u201c make a difference. \u201d Thunberg doesn \u2019 t allow for that . She also lives her life with a profound attention\u2014she refused a nomination for the Children \u2019 s Climate Prize , for example , because the finalists would have to travel by plane to the ceremony . These kinds of actions help demonstrate just how serious she is .\nThunberg wants big change . She \u2019 s not willing to be placated . And she \u2019 s found that her methodology works . \u201c I made them feel guilty , \u201d she said of her successful campaign to get her parents to quit flying and eating meat . ( \u201c It \u2019 s like you \u2019 ve killed 80 people ! \u201d she said to her mother once , when she came back from a gig in Japan . ) \u201c You say you love your children above all else , and yet you \u2019 re stealing their future before their very eyes , \u201d she said at the U.N. \u2019 s Climate Change Conference , in December of 2018 .\nMany of us have been conditioned to respond to a person like Thunberg , who lives a life of rigid adherence to her own morals , with annoyance . We deploy logic to excuse our behavior . Sure , flights are bad , it \u2019 s easy to think , but the planes are still flying ; me not buying a ticket isn \u2019 t going to help . Besides , anything I can do in my own life will change nothing , so long as governments and corporations aren \u2019 t on board with the cause . And yet , there \u2019 s a good argument to be made that living one \u2019 s values matters because doing so helps us remember to advocate for the kind of systemic change we need .\nIn my own life , the \u201c Greta effect \u201d has resulted in me finally eliminating meat from my family \u2019 s weekly household menu , after years of meaning to do so . We don \u2019 t have flight shaming in the United States , quite yet , but I don \u2019 t think I \u2019 m alone in beginning to suspect that our years of thoughtless tourism and guilt-free conference attendance may be drawing to a close . It \u2019 s impossible to say how much of this sea change may be attributable to Thunberg \u2019 s public refusal to fly , but her uncompromising approach aligns with the way that many of us are feeling .\nThis is one of the things that the right hates about Thunberg : She shames grown people\u2014for flying , for driving , for profiting off things that are undermining the planet \u2019 s future . The undercurrent of much conservative Greta hate is a feeling that authority is askew in this case : \u201c Why are adults listening to this nagging girl ? \u201d Part of that is misogyny . As Martin Gelin pointed out in the New Republic recently , researchers have found no small amount of woman-hating threaded through the backlash against climate activism . Environmentalism has long been culturally coded as feminine\u2014come back , Teddy Roosevelt ! \u2014and people reluctant to sacrifice their personal pleasures for climate stability may , when confronted by someone like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or Greta Thunberg , feel oppressively corrected .\nI \u2019 d add to this very true observation about gender dynamics the fact that teenage activism , especially the kind that calls adults on the carpet the way Thunberg \u2019 s does , triggers conservatives who tend to hold a stronger belief in a hierarchal family model . Why , these critics ask , should I listen to what a young person wants ? This feeling , blown up in scale , might be recognizable as the lack of consideration for future generations that allows deniers and delayers to mentally resist any action on climate . In contrast , on the left , many ( not all ) believe that parenting\u2014or , just living in a world with young people\u2014can also be about learning from these whippersnappers , being fueled by their enthusiasms , finding yourself reinvigorated by their fresh regard of things you \u2019 ve long known . In the story of Thunberg \u2019 s appeal to her parents , and the subsequent transformation of their lives , conservatives may see a relationship out of balance . I , on the other hand , recognize a family that feels both familiar and aspirational .\nThere \u2019 s one more timeworn conservative response to Thunberg \u2019 s activism : \u201c The parents , or some other professional adult activist , must be telling her what to say. \u201d This is an argument that , as I wrote last year when the right started saying the same about the Parkland kids , has been used against youth activism at least since children demonstrated with Martin Luther King Jr . It neatly sidesteps the social taboo on criticizing children in public by blaming their parents instead . In Thunberg \u2019 s case , concern trolls have professed themselves to be \u201c worried \u201d about her mental health , calling her a \u201c child sacrifice \u201d and a \u201c puppet. \u201d In fact , climate deniers have long argued that children shouldn \u2019 t be taught climate change because it scares them too much . ( One U.K. blog , Climate Lessons , has been collecting news stories of children being terrified after learning about climate change in schools since 2010 , and has , in the past year or so , been relentlessly focused on Thunberg . )\nI suspect that deniers and delayers don \u2019 t resist climate education and youth climate activism simply out of protectiveness toward children . Researchers from North Carolina State University found , in a study published this year , that educating middle school children about climate change led to increased concern on the issue from their parents . \u201c We \u2026 found that the results were most pronounced for three groups : conservative parents , parents of daughters , and fathers , \u201d one of the researchers said . Another added : \u201c [ Children ] seem to help people critically consider ways in which being concerned about climate change may be in line with their values . \u201d\nI think this is the real reason Thunberg \u2019 s message hits so hard , on both the right and left . She scares the right because it can see that we adults are taking her seriously . She transfixes the left because she helps activists focus on the misalignment between what we believe and what we do . \u201c Some people say that the climate crisis is something we have all created , but that is not true , \u201d Thunberg said at Davos , speaking to the wealthiest people in the world . \u201c Because if everyone is guilty then no one is to blame , and someone is to blame \u2026 I think many of you here today belong to that group of people. \u201d In 2019 , we were finally ready to hear that blunt message , and move forward .",
