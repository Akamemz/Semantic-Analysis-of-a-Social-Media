    "content": "The White House announced Friday that President Trump signed an Executive Grant of Clemency commuting the `` unjust sentence '' of Roger Stone , just days before the longtime political operative was slated to report to prison to serve more than three years for charges stemming from former Special Counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s investigation .\nIn a lengthy statement released late Friday , White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the president had made the decision to commute Stone 's sentence `` in light of the egregious facts and circumstances surrounding his unfair prosecution , arrest , and trial . ''\n\u201c Roger Stone is a victim of the Russia Hoax that the Left and its allies in the media perpetuated for years in an attempt to undermine the Trump Presidency , \u201d McEnany said in a statement Friday night . \u201c There was never any collusion between the Trump Campaign , or the Trump Administration , with Russia . Such collusion was never anything other than a fantasy of partisans unable to accept the result of the 2016 election . The collusion delusion spawned endless and farcical investigations , conducted at great taxpayer expense , looking for evidence that did not exist . \u201d\nMcEnany added that Mueller \u2019 s office \u201c resorted to process-based charges leveled at high-profile people in an attempt to manufacture the false impression of criminality lurking below the surface . \u201d\n\u201c These charges were the product of recklessness borne of frustration and malice , \u201d she said .\nMcEnany touted Stone \u2019 s career in politics , noting that he worked for nearly 50 years as a consultant for high-profile Republican politicians , including former President Ronald Reagan , Sen. Bob Dole and others , while noting that Stone is also known for `` his outspoken support for President Donald J. Trump and opposition to Hillary Clinton . ''\nMcEnany went on to blast Mueller \u2019 s prosecutors for the fashion in which they arrested Stone , noting he is a \u201c 67 year old man with numerous medical conditions , who had never been convicted of another crime , and that they used \u201c dozens of FBI agents with automatic weapons and tactical equipment , armored vehicles , and an amphibious unit to execute a pre-dawn raid of his home , where he was with his wife of many years . \u201d\nMcEnany went on to add that Stone would \u201c be put at serious medical risk in prison . \u201d\nStone was set to report to prison on July 14 to serve 40 months . He was sentenced in February to more than three years in prison after being convicted in November 2019 on seven counts of obstruction , witness tampering and making false statements to Congress . Stone , however , has appealed his conviction and continues to deny any wrongdoing .\n`` He has appealed his conviction and is seeking a new trial . He maintains his innocence and has stated that he expects to be fully exonerated by the justice system , '' McEnany said . `` Mr. Stone , like every American , deserves a fair trial and every opportunity to vindicate himself before the courts . \u201d\nShe added : \u201c The President does not wish to interfere with his efforts to do so . At this time , however , and particularly in light of the egregious facts and circumstances surrounding his unfair prosecution , arrest , and trial , the President has determined to commute his sentence . ''\n\u201c Roger Stone has already suffered greatly , \u201d she added . `` He was treated very unfairly , as were many others in this case . Roger Stone is now a free man ! \u201d\nIn a statement to Fox News , Stone 's attorney Grant Smith said : `` Mr. Stone is incredibly honored that President Trump used his awesome and unique power under the Constitution of the United States for this act of mercy . ''\nSmith added : `` Mr. and Mrs. Stone appreciate all the consideration the President gave to this matter . ''\nEarlier Friday , an appeals court denied Stone 's request to delay reporting for his sentence , saying he must report for prison on Tuesday .\n`` In sum , Stone is not legally eligible for further postponement of his reporting date under 18 U.S.C . \u00a7 3145 ( c ) , which is the only basis on which he seeks relief from this court . We therefore deny his motion , '' the court wrote in its order .\nEXCLUSIVE : ROGER STONE SAYS HE IS 'PRAYING ' FOR CLEMENCY FROM TRUMP , DAYS BEFORE HE IS SET TO REPORT TO PRISON\nTrump , for weeks , has signaled he could be open to granting Stone clemency \u2014 tweeting last month that Stone was \u201c a victim of a corrupt and illegal Witch Hunt , one which will go down as the greatest political crime in history . He can sleep well at night ! \u201d\nDuring an exclusive interview with Fox News this week , Stone said he was \u201c praying \u201d for Trump to intervene .\nWhen asked whether he \u2019 d prefer a pardon or a commutation of his sentence , Stone said \u201c either one obviously would have an effect , in my opinion , of saving my life . \u201d\nA presidential pardon completely absolves an individual of the crime he or she is found to have committed . A commutation lessens the punishment or eliminates jail time , but leaves the conviction standing .\n\u201c I have deep concerns about going to a prison where there absolutely is COVID virus , and , therefore , either one would have an effect of saving my life , '' Stone said .\nHe added : \u201c If I should be fortunate enough to get a commutation , I would continue to fight for vindication . \u201d\nAs of Thursday evening , Stone said he had not received any formal communication from the White House on a potential pardon or commutation of his sentence .\n`` I think I \u2019 ll be the last person to know , \u201d Stone told Fox News . \u201c He hates leaks , and he hates to be told what to do . I have instructed my lawyers not to contact the lawyers at the White House .\n\u201c The president , who I \u2019 ve known for 40 years , has an incredible sense of fairness . He is aware that the people trying to destroy Michael Flynn , now trying to destroy me , are the people trying to destroy him , '' Stone said .\nHe added : `` I certainly think it could happen . I \u2019 m not going to second-guess the president . \u201d\nSTONE SENTENCED TO MORE THAN 3 YEARS IN PRISON FOR LYING TO CONGRESS , WITNESS TAMPERING\nStone was not charged with any underlying crime of coordinating with Russia during the 2016 presidential election , though Mueller \u2019 s team investigated Stone over tweets claiming to have information about WikiLeaks document dumps prior to their release .\nWhen asked whether Stone felt WikiLeaks influenced the 2016 election , he said : \u201c Yes . All of it . \u201d\n\u201c My whole purpose in hyping Wikileaks on Twitter was to make sure the media didn \u2019 t sweep it under the rug , only because I was told it was politically significant , \u201d Stone said of his tweets in 2016 , which he said were \u201c not specific , \u201d and simply flagged that a WikiLeaks document dump \u201c would be big \u201d and was coming .\n\u201c I never discussed it with Trump . I have no idea what he thought about it , we never discussed it , \u201d Stone said . \u201c You have to understand something about Donald Trump\u2014when you talk to him on the phone , he talks and you listen . That \u2019 s kind of the way it works . \u201d\nWhen asked whether Stone had any regrets over his involvement in 2016 , he said no .\n\u201c I engaged in legitimate , perfectly legal political activity which Mueller \u2019 s corrupt investigation chose to criminalize , \u201d Stone said . \u201c I thought the results of the 2016 election were crucial . \u201d\nMeanwhile , earlier this week , Facebook announced it had removed a network of accounts on the platform and on Instagram allegedly linked to Stone .
