    "content": "Washington has a spending problem . It also has an \u201c explaining problem . \u201d\nIn fact , the latter may be a bigger issue . The explaining problem \u201d certainly helps illustrate last week \u2019 s Senate and House votes to prevent a government shutdown , suspend the debt ceiling and devote an immediate $ 15.25 billion for hurricane relief .\nAll noes came from GOP senators , but not before a failed effort by Sen. Rand Paul , R-Ky. , to offset the hurricane money with unspent foreign aid dollars . The Senate also neutered a plan by Sen. Ben Sasse , R-Neb. , to decouple the hurricane assistance from overall government funding and the debt-ceiling freeze .\nIt \u2019 s easy to characterize the bill as \u201c emergency hurricane aid legislation \u201d -- which it was . But in an impassioned speech shortly before the vote , Sasse described the bill as \u201c much clunkier and much less explicable or defensible to your or my constituents . \u201d\nCongress long ago designed the debt ceiling as a tool to harness spending . In other words , if you want to spend more , then lawmakers should be on record as voting to lift the debt limit .\nHowever , that principle became a problem when entitlement programs like Medicare , Medicaid and Social Security exploded . Congress long ago authorized all of those entitlements , which consume two-thirds of all federal spending and drive up the debt .\nCongress doesn \u2019 t vote at regular intervals to approve money for entitlements . Yet lawmakers must regularly cast ballots to increase the debt ceiling -- a threshold challenged by the growth of entitlement programs .\nThose phenomena don \u2019 t jibe . So lawmakers sweat nearly every year about taking what the casual observer would interpret as a vote to \u201c spend more . \u201d\nThat makes lifting the debt ceiling one of the most virulent votes a lawmaker can cast . However , a failure to increase the debt ceiling could spark a stock market crash or trigger a downgrade in the government \u2019 s credit rating .\nThat \u2019 s why presidential administrations and congressional leaders of both parties always hunt around for some method to latch a debt ceiling increase with something else . This time , convenient alibis boiled in the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Basin . So Congress had to approve emergency spending for hurricanes Harvey and Irma .\nOf course , not everyone would vote yea on such an amalgamated legislative package . But more than enough would . That perversely eases the blow of lifting the debt limit by \u2026 wait for it \u2026 spending more money .\n\u201c We \u2019 re going to use the hurricane as an excuse to hide from the truth , \u201d lectured Sasse on the Senate floor . \u201c We 're not going to have any conversation about the fact that we constantly spend more money than we have and we have to borrow to do it . \u201d\nThe Senate then approved the package 80-17 . Sasse and Paul were among the noes .\nAt the time , Irma was forecast to lash South Carolina with its torrents . Yet . Sen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , voted nay .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve got zero problem helping people with hurricanes , \u201d he said . \u201c I \u2019 ve got a real problem of legislating in a fashion that continues to put the military in a box . \u201d\nGraham was referring to the interim spending part of the combo bill that funds the government through December 8 . No quarter of the U.S. government bears a bigger hardship than the Pentagon when Congress only grants the services a few months of spending direction .\n\u201c This just puts us right back into the cauldron here , and we \u2019 re going to have another crisis in 90 days , \u201d Graham said . \u201c It was more of a protest vote than anything else . \u201d\nOr consider the approach taken by Sen. Joni Ernst , R-Iowa .\n\u201c Ernst Supports Relief for Hurricane Harvey Victims , Votes No on Debt Limit Increase , \u201d trumpeted a news release from her press shop .\nLike Graham , Ernst voted no on the legislative trifecta . The jerry-rigged bill forced lawmakers who voted nay to concoct oratorical contortions to explain why they favored hurricane assistance yet opposed the debt ceiling .\nErnst argued she backed the Sasse plan for a standalone hurricane aid package , But note that she didn \u2019 t even say she voted \u201c for \u201d Sasse \u2019 s effort , only \u201c supports . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s because there was never a straight , up-or-down vote on Sasse \u2019 s effort . The Senate voted only to table , or kill , Sasse \u2019 s motion to limit the bill to hurricane funding .\nSo with no direct vote , Ernst is stuck . She \u2019 s left saying she \u201c supports hurricane relief. \u201d However , the Senate did take a full-on roll call vote on the underlying legislation that funded the government , addressed the hurricanes and iced the debt ceiling . Therefore , Ernst \u2019 s statement indicates she \u201c votes no on debt limit increase . \u201d\nVoting no on the debt ceiling may sound great to fiscal conservatives . But others could flag Ernst \u2019 s vote against the hurricane money . Lawmakers and their wordsmiths convulse when forced to draft tortured statements to explain vote nuances .\nAnd remember that most of the reason behind lifting the debt ceiling isn \u2019 t because of a vote Ernst or any other senator cast . It \u2019 s mostly because entitlement programs are dialed-in on automatic pilot . The money flies out the door without a congressional check .\nThis sums up the quintessence of Washington \u2019 s gnarled \u201c explaining problem . \u201d\nOn Friday morning , Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney headed to Capitol Hill to appeal to House Republicans to support the plan .\nSomeone from Equifax could have made a better case for their cybersecurity protocols . Many Republicans found Mulvaney \u2019 s appearance particularly ironic . He formerly led the conservative House Freedom Caucus and repeatedly rejected debt limit hikes when he represented South Carolina in the House .\n\u201c We should have sold admission passes for the discussion . I heard it was a sight to behold to have Mick Mulvaney coming in arguing for a debt ceiling increase , \u201d scoffed Rep. Charlie Dent , R-Pa .\nDespite Mnuchin and Mulvaney \u2019 s entreaty , the House voted on the Senate-approved plan 316-90 . All 90 noes came from Republicans . Only 133 Republicans voted yea -- compared to 183 Democrats . Lawmakers from both parties again stated their abhorrence to lump issues together . But the defense from those who voted yes was that they had to do this .\nCongress could really curb the fiscal trajectory and neutralize debt ceiling crises if members adopted a \u201c budget \u201d that indeed tamed Medicare , Medicaid and Social Security spending .\nA congressional \u201c budget \u201d is different from appropriations bills , which were contained in the \u201c no government shutdown \u201d part of this package . Same for emergency disaster relief money . Budgets address all federal spending \u2013 including entitlements . And they \u2019 re not binding .\nBut here \u2019 s the problem : The Budget Act of 1974 compels the president to draft a budget model and submit it to Congress .

Presidential budgets are aspirational . The numbers don \u2019 t have to add up and rarely do . Same for those written on Capitol Hill . For years , Republicans designed \u201c budgets \u201d that purportedly steer federal spending on a path to \u201c balance \u201d over a period of years . They look great on paper .\nLawmakers who fancy themselves as fiscal hawks get the chance to \u201c explain \u201d why this is such a good idea .\nYet federal spending climbs .
