And Trump \u2019 s response to Friday \u2019 s horrific white supremacist terrorist attack in New Zealand that saw 49 Muslims murdered was coldly calculated to play to them , especially his refusal to use the term \u201c white supremacist terrorism . \u201d\nBut first there was to Trump \u2019 s reaction to the terrorist attack on Twitter where he spoke of standing , \u201c in solidarity with New Zealand \u201d and declaring , \u201c We love you New Zealand ! \u201d Great sentiment but where was the mention of Muslims , as in , \u201c I stand with the Muslim community today \u201d ? ! After all , the 49 victims were all Muslims killed in their place of worship because they were Muslim .\nThere \u2019 s no doubt Trump \u2019 s failure to say any kind words about Muslims was by design . Trump understands that would likely upset his base whom he has fed a diet of anti-Muslim hate , from declaring that \u201c Islam hates us \u201d to calling for a total ban on Muslims coming to this country , and his 2016 comment that takes on a different meaning after Friday \u2019 s terror attack : \u201c We 're having problems with the Muslims coming into this country\u2026You have to deal with the mosques , whether we like it or not . \u201d\nAnd then , Friday afternoon , it got worse . Responding to a question by an ABC reporter about whether he believed there was a growing threat of white nationalism worldwide , Trump responded , \u201c I don \u2019 t really , \u201d adding , \u201c I think it \u2019 s a small group of people that have very , very serious problems. \u201d Our own ears and eyes ( as well as statistics ) tells us that \u2019 s a lie . Again , this reaction is because Trump gets his base better than anyone .\nOf course , this is the same Trump who hammered Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign for not saying the phrase , \u201c radical Islamic Terrorism. \u201d As Trump declared then , \u201c Now , to solve a problem , you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name . She won \u2019 t say the name . \u201d\nBut repeating time and time again \u201c radical Islamic terrorism \u201d plays great with Trump \u2019 s base . After all 65 percent of 2016 GOP primary voters supported banning all Muslims from entering America . In contrast , if Trump slammed white supremacists , that would not excite them .\nI made that very point in my May 2017 article , months before Charlottesville , after two deadly attacks by self-professed white supremacists , one in Portland and the other in New York City . In fact , after the New York City attack by a self-avowed 28-year-old white supremacist who murdered a black man in the hopes of starting a race war , the murderer was even charged with terrorism by the Manhattan District Attorney .\nBut still Trump refused to use the phrase \u201c white supremacist terrorism. \u201d While Trump remained silent , white supremacists , however , did not . In response to that article , Trump-supporting white supremacists at the Neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website were so outraged that I would demand this of Trump , they fabricated tweets in my name claiming I was involved in the Manchester , England bombing that had occurred a few weeks before at an Ariana Grande concert . And then they urged their supporters to \u201c confront \u201d me , which they did in a barrage of death threats . ( I sued the New Nazi website in a lawsuit in federal court that is still pending . )\nAnd just three months later came Charlottesville , where MAGA hats littered the crowd as did white supremacists who in the past had praised Trump , such as former Klan Grand Wizard David Duke . And after yet another white supremacist terrorist attack on Trump \u2019 s watch , with the murder of Heather Heyer at that rally , Trump blamed \u201c both sides \u201d while still refusing to say the words , \u201c white supremacist terrorism . \u201d\n\u201c The gunman in New Zealand hailed Trump in his manifesto as ' a symbol of renewed white identity . ' \u201d\nAt this point , Trump lies somewhere between an apologist for white supremacist terrorism and a person who inspires people to commit such acts . While ultimately those who commit the violent acts are responsible for their crimes , we can \u2019 t ignore the connection between people who support Trump and white supremacist violence . For example , the gunman in New Zealand hailed Trump in his manifesto as \u201c a symbol of renewed white identity . \u201d\nAnd we have just recently seen two other groups of self-avowed white supremacist Trump supporters either be arrested to or sentenced to prison for plotting to kill Muslims in America , in attacks that would \u2019 ve looked like what we just saw in New Zealand . In January , four young white man were arrested plotting to kill Muslims in Islamberg , New York , a primarily African-American Muslim community about two hours north of New York City . One of the men arrested not only praised Trump but also white-supremacist images like Confederate statues while speaking of killing Muslims on social media , including children : \u201c Kids have been shown to be terrorists too and have killed our people .

And that should scare all Americans who oppose white supremacy .",
