Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders , commanded the stage , beating back attacks from moderates who were clamoring for attention to boost their low-polling campaigns . The dynamics will shift Wednesday , with former Vice President Joe Biden and California Sen. Kamala Harris at center stage and progressive agitators like New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Washington Gov . Jay Inslee on the stage 's outer edges trying to make their marks .\nBiden will be sandwiched between his two fiercest critics in the party 's 2020 Democratic primary field : Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker . The two black senators have both sharply criticized Biden over racial issues in recent weeks .\nHarris stole the show in the first debate when she went after Biden over his early-career opposition to federally mandated busing . Booker has said -- again and again -- that he plans to confront Biden over his role in the passage of the 1994 crime bill , which included policies that played a role in mass incarceration .\nOther candidates who desperately need breakout moments to lift themselves out of the low-single digits and into contention -- such as former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro , New York Sen.

In a statement after Biden released his criminal justice reform plan last week, Booker said, \"Joe Biden had more than 40 years to get this right.

One to watch: Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who has said Biden's proposals on climate change \"lack teeth.\" De Blasio also showed in the first debate that he is eager to interject -- particularly when he sees openings to lambast the private insurance industry, which Biden has argued in favor of keeping in place in a prominent role in his health care plan, which largely builds on Obamacare.\n\n2.
