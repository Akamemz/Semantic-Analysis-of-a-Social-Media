    "content": "The White House is reportedly considering fines and other trade penalties against China or any other country guilty of cyberattacks amid evidence of an unrelenting cyber espionage campaign linked to the Chinese government .\nThe Associated Press reported Wednesday that the actions are being considered as part of the Obama administration 's response to a report that claimed the Chinese Army is behind a series of cyberattacks on U.S. companies .\nOfficials familiar with the administration 's plans spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the threatened action .\nThe Chinese government denies being involved in the cyberattacks cited in a cybersecurity firm 's analysis of breaches that compromised more than 140 companies . On Wednesday , China 's Defense Ministry called the report deeply flawed .\nMandiant , a Virginia-based cybersecurity firm , released a torrent of details Monday that tied a secret Chinese military unit in Shanghai to years of cyberattacks against U.S. companies . Mandiant concluded that the breaches can be linked to the People 's Liberation Army 's Unit 61398 .\nMilitary experts believe the unit is part of the People 's Liberation Army 's cybercommand , which is under the direct authority of the General Staff Department , China 's version of the Joint Chiefs of Staff . As such , its activities would likely be authorized at the highest levels of China 's military .\nU.S. officials would not comment directly on the report Monday . But they said the U.S. is bulking up its cyber-defenses while stressing a new -- albeit controversial -- White House executive order aimed at improving the nation 's ability to defend against cyberattacks .\nState Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland and White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said U.S. officials have started a dialogue with the `` highest levels '' of the Chinese government , including with `` officials in the military . ''\n`` It is a major challenge for us in the national security arena , '' Carney said Monday , adding that it is known that foreign countries and companies `` swipe '' sensitive U.S. information .\nThe release of the Mandiant report , complete with details on three of the alleged hackers and photographs of one of the military unit 's buildings in Shanghai , makes public what U.S. authorities have said less publicly for years . But it also increases the pressure on the U.S. to take more forceful action against the Chinese for what experts say has been years of systematic espionage .\n`` If the Chinese government flew planes into our airspace , our planes would escort them away .
