    "content": "To most Americans , last week \u2019 s massacre at a holiday party in San Bernardino , Calif. , is emblematic of mass shootings in the United States today : violent , random , and perpetrated by radical individuals armed with assault weapons .\nYet many experts contend that such events are relatively rare in the broader scheme of gun violence in America . Indeed , the Monitor \u2019 s analysis of crowdsourced data from 2015 suggests that the savage incidents that often capture public imagination diverge from the reality of multiple shootings that take place across the nation every day .\nThat gap , some say , points to a culture that has developed a stratified sense of what kinds of violence merit attention .\n\u201c The way we talk about mass shootings , you \u2019 re almost creating two categories : shootings of people that matter a lot and shootings of people who don \u2019 t matter at all , \u201d says Eugene O \u2019 Donnell , a lecturer at the City University of New York \u2019 s John Jay College of Criminal Justice . \u201c There \u2019 s this hierarchy of victims , and we should categorically reject that . \u201d\nThe Monitor studied two online databases \u2013 Mass Shooting Tracker and the Gun Violence Archive \u2013 that employ perhaps the broadest popular definition of \u201c mass shootings \u201d : incidents that leave four or more people dead or wounded . Both sites rely on news reports and are unofficial , and are the source of expert dispute over what should constitute a mass shooting .\nStill , the two databases together provide a glimpse into that victim hierarchy , and help paint a portrait of the face of gun violence in the US today .\nBased on the definition the two sites use , and combining the incidents listed in each , there have been 367 mass shootings reported this year as of Dec. 7 . More than 100 involved only one death , and nearly 160 involved no fatalities at all . The incidents occurred in 47 states and 221 cities .\nUnlike San Bernardino , these cases rarely involved assault weapons or radicalized shooters , and many stemmed from trivial circumstances \u2013 such as arguments at bars or parties \u2013 that escalated into gunfights . Many of the wounded and killed were bystanders , and in many cases the shooter escaped , leaving police with few leads .\nSuch incidents rarely receive more than a few paragraphs and a follow-up story in a local news site or two . Take the case of Odell Branch , Sr. , a 77-year-old man killed in March . Mr . Branch was watching television in his Chicago home when a stray bullet from an outdoor shootout between rival gangs came in through his window , striking him in the head . The shooting injured three others , including Branch \u2019 s two great-grandchildren , who were in the room with him .\n`` He 's a Christian , he \u2019 s retired , a pillar of the neighborhood , \u201d one of Branch \u2019 s neighbors told the local ABC affiliate at the time . \u201c A good guy , always good guy , always trying to help . \u201d\nDetectives questioned a few \u201c persons of interest \u201d following the incident , but made no arrests .\nThe same is true of a children \u2019 s birthday party over Labor Day weekend . The celebration turned tragic when several men opened fire at the front yard of the Charlotte , N.C. , residence following the breaking of a pi\u00f1ata . By the time the shooting stopped , 7-year-old Kevin Antonio Calderon Rodas was dead and three others were wounded .\nLocals managed to raise more than $ 4,000 for Kevin \u2019 s funeral expenses , and police arrested nearly a hundred people following what turned out to be a particularly violent holiday weekend . But no one has answered for Kevin \u2019 s death , and the story went unnoticed by the rest of the nation .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a sad state of affairs in the city and our country when a 7-year-old boy can \u2019 t be free to celebrate a birthday party without being murdered , \u201d Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Deputy Chief Jeff Estes told The Associated Press .\nSome cases do receive more attention than others . The shooting that killed 15-year-old basketball star Armoni Sexton in Paterson , N.J. , in April , for instance , eventually earned coverage in The New York Times . Police even arrested local resident Gregory A. Oliver for the crime , charging him with one count of murder , two counts of attempted murder , and weapons possession .\nBut by and large such events remain only in the minds of neighbors , family , and friends . Despite receiving national coverage for its brutality , for instance , few remember Joseph Jesse Aldridge , the Missouri man who killed seven people , and then himself , after finding his mother dead of apparently natural causes . His door-to-door rampage , which took place in February , took out nearly 20 percent of the small , rural community of Tyrone .\nPart of the reason these events \u2013 and hundreds of others \u2013 remain unrecognized except by locals is the tendency of the public to feel like such incidents could never happen to them .\n\u201c When the event is familial [ or ] \u2026 gang-related , the public can , if you will , put that event at a distance and pretend they \u2019 re not somehow involved because the event involved a group of people of which the public is not a part , like a family or a gang . \u2018 Oh , I don \u2019 t have to worry about this , \u2019 \u201d says Garen Wintemute , director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California , Davis .\nOn the other hand , he says , the randomness of mass shootings such as San Bernardino tend to unsettle people and force them to consider the possibility that it could happen to them .\n\u201c There \u2019 s no connection between the shooter \u2019 s and the victims , which means anyone could be a victim .
