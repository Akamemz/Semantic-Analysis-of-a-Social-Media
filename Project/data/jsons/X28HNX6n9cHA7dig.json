    "content": "The Democrat leading the New Jersey Assembly \u2019 s probe into allegedly retaliatory lane closures on the world \u2019 s busiest bridge announced the issuance of 20 new subpoenas Wednesday . While Assemblyman Wisniewski declined to identify those being subpoenaed , state Sen. Loretta Weinberg told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the Senate \u2019 s parallel probe would be issuing subpoenas to two key Christie appointees : Port Authority chairman David Samson , and Christie \u2019 s authorities director Regina Egea , whom he \u2019 s tapped to be his next chief of staff . Weinberg , the Senate majority leader , blasted Samson and his fellow commissioners \u2019 approach to the scandal as \u201c disgraceful and disgusting. \u201d She called the governor \u2019 s self-defense at last week \u2019 s press conference \u201c absolutely not credible , \u201d and charged , \u201c They tried to change this into somehow it should make everybody else mad that Fort Lee had some kind of private roads to the George Washington Bridge -- which is a patent lie . \u201d\nChristie \u201c got a copy of a letter from me on Sept. 19 \u2013 [ to ] which I never received a reply , \u201d Sen. Weinberg told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . The governor , she argued , \u201c either did not tell the truth when he said he didn \u2019 t know about it , or he didn \u2019 t want to know. \u201d A condensed version of our conversation follows .\nNBC is reporting that the Christie reelection campaign is on the subpoena list . Can you confirm that ?\nNo , I can \u2019 t . What I can confirm is on the Senate side , that we will be subpoenaing documents from Mr. Samson , the chairperson of the Port Authority , from Commissioner Pat Schuber , a commissioner on the Port Authority , and from the governor \u2019 s new chief of staff [ to be ] , Regina Egea . I have not seen the rest of the subpoena list yet .\nWhat \u2019 s the reason that those particular individuals are being subpoenaed ?\nWell , in terms of Mr. Samson and Mr. Schuber , I \u2019 ve spent four months appearing before Port Authority meetings , bringing to their attention what went on here and asking them for an explanation .\nStarting Sept. 19 , when I wrote a letter to Commissioner Schuber , because he is somebody I voted [ to confirm ] \u2026 I reached out to him to try to find out what \u2019 s going on here . He called me and told me he would get to the bottom of it . I have yet to hear back . This is now Jan. 16 -- just about four months to the day .\nI \u2019 ve appeared before four Port Authority meetings , which Mr. Samson chaired . They all knew what was going \u2013 or let \u2019 s say , they all should have known . And I haven \u2019 t seen yet one iota of evidence that anybody asked to get to the bottom of it .\nSo I want to see what documents [ are ] right in Mr. Samson \u2019 s office that might pertain to this \u2026\nHopefully , we can reach out and Assemblyman Wisniewski and I will try to work together on this .\nRegarding Mr. Samson , the letter released to U.S. Sen. Rockefeller today by the Port Authority seems to put a lot of blame on Wildstein --\nYeah , in which they say that there was no traffic study ? That letter , you \u2019 re talking about ?\nYes . The letter today that seems to suggest Wildstein was the one daily in control of all of this --\nWell \u2013 [ laughs ] -- how about Nov. 25 , when Bill Baroni went before the Transportation Committee -- not under oath , not under subpoena -- and announced that there was a traffic study , and these were dedicated lanes ? Nobody looked into it ? Nobody asked him -- that is so outrageous . What have these people , who were in charge of the Port Authority , what have they been doing ? Other than apparently circling the wagons .\nIt is outrageous . Their employee , the deputy executive director of the Port Authority , appeared with charts and big red pens , to try to add credence to the coverup . And they did nothing from Nov. 25 , when he made up that whole story , and nobody said , \u201c There is no traffic study. \u201d Where were they ? Where were these commissioners ?\nNow , I \u2019 m sorry if I get a little bit exercised over this , but I \u2019 ve invested a tremendous amount of time trying to find out the truth , and the fact that these men sat there for four meetings and pretended to ignore me is infuriating .\nAnd back in October , I raised the issue : I went to a Port Authority meeting and I said if you \u2019 re not going to be forthcoming , I \u2019 m asking for subpoena power . Well , lo and behold , Jan. 16 , the Senate acted as well it should , and created our own special committee with subpoena power . Now they \u2019 re going to have to answer .\nTheir lack of accountability and oversight is disgraceful and disgusting . And these are the people who are in charge of millions of dollars ? And that I have to pay $ 13 in tolls every time I want to drive over the George Washington Bridge ?\nWho are you pointing the finger at here ? Are --\nI \u2019 m pointing the finger at all of the New Jersey commissioners . How could --\nNow they do a letter in answer to Sen. Rockefeller that there is no evidence that there was ever a traffic study . This is Jan. 16 .\nBill Baroni , the deputy executive director of the Port Authority , having been appointed by Gov . Chris Christie to that position , appeared before an Assembly Transportation Committee , not under oath , not as the result of a subpoena , but voluntarily , and stated that there was a traffic study , and that it was because there was this issue of unfairness , that Fort Lee had somehow had a private road to the George Washington bridge .\nThat was a coverup . I said it then , and I \u2019 m saying it again .\nAnd now , to have the Port Authority write a letter in response to Sen. Rockefeller that says , well , there \u2019 s no evidence of a traffic study anywhere \u2013 where have they been since Nov. 25 ?\n\u2026 And there are emails that were subpoenaed , that have been out there in the press , where Mr. Baroni was so full of himself , he was like , in essence \u2013 I \u2019 m paraphrasing here : What does Trenton think ? Did I do good ? And he gets an email back from Wildstein : You did good . And Baroni says : Just good ? You know , in other words , he wanted more praise for having appeared there .\nYou know , this is so revolting and so over the top \u2026 They put , for four days , thousands of people in jeopardy , and we still don \u2019 t know the answer of who ordered it and why .\nThen we have fast forward , Mr. Wildstein is going to , quote , \u201c resign \u201d with words of praise from the governor , and allowed to stay until Dec. 31 . What happened ? ...\nThe governor never asked Mr. Wildstein what went on here ? I mean , they -- the whole thing is so outlandish and the coverup \u2013 the coverup wasn \u2019 t even good .\nThis criticism you mentioned of the commissioners , does that apply to David Samson ? To Pat Foye ?\nMy criticism applies to David Samson , and every New Jersey commissioner on there .\nAnd these emails that were released , in which David Samson suggests that Foye is \u201c playing in traffic \u201d and \u201c stirring up trouble \u201d --\nYeah , as I said we \u2019 re going to [ subpoena ] Mr. Samson \u2019 s documents . And instead of saying [ that ] , how about finding from Patrick Foye what went on ? What processes weren \u2019 t followed ?\n\u2026 I wrote on Sept. 19 , copied to Samson and the governor , which they all ignored ... I went to a subcommittee meeting Oct. 7 , I asked all these questions , and nobody gave an answer . So I went back on Oct. 16 to the full Port Authority .\nI quoted Patrick Foye \u2019 s email . So nobody sitting up there -- all of those commissioners , who are in charge of our New York-New Jersey Port Authority , all of them sat there rolling their eyes , looking at each other -- you know , I know the people on there \u2026\nI know these people . And the fact that they sat there and that now , today , we are getting a document released that says there \u2019 s no evidence that there ever was a traffic study -- where were the commissioners ?\nThey bear as much responsibility in this as any other person . I have yet to see one document , I have yet to hear one voice from any of the aforementioned , saying , \u201c Could we please get to the bottom of this ? \u201d\nAnd all Mr. Samson did , rather than calling on Pat Foye , he was mad because he leaked an email that said that they might have even broken laws ? That \u2019 s what got him mad , because the email was released ?\n\u2026 We are going to subpoena all of David Samson \u2019 s documents pertaining to the Port Authority around this issue .\nGiven that Wildstein says , \u201c Samson helping us to retaliate , \u201d and given Samson \u2019 s apparent irritation with Foye , is it credible to you the idea that Samson was not in on this before it happened ?\nNo . Because I don \u2019 t know whether [ chairman ] Samson was in on it before it happened , but I do know that chairman Samson knew about my questions back on Sept. 19.And I know Commissioner Samson knew about my questions on Oct. 7 , on Oct. 16 , on Nov. 13 and on Dec. 4 .\nAll of those meetings I went to , and got up and spoke to each of these people personally and publicly -- and I have never heard a word back from one of them .\nSo I have to base a judgment on that that : They have been sorely lacking in their responsibility to the people I represent , and to the people that Gov . Christie represents too . And to put thousands of people in jeopardy and harm \u2019 s way , to cause little kindergarteners and first-graders to be late to their first day of school , to cause doctors to complain that they couldn \u2019 t get to their surgical practice , to -- all the anecdotes that we have heard -- and we have yet to hear from one commissioner in the Port Authority .\nSo while the four people around the governor , two of them resigned under pressure from the Port Authority , and two in the governor \u2019 s office were fired -- the governor appoints these commissioners , he nominates them , we vote , advise and consent \u2013 and the fact that all of these people around the governor , that the chairperson of the Port Authority is a close friend , a trusted adviser , and that chairman sat there while Bill Baroni came forth and gave testimony \u2013 again , not under oath , but gave testimony -- that was false , misleading and a lie , and nothing even nicer I can think of saying about it .\nWell , if David Samson can not produce one bit of paperwork or information that he in fact took his responsibility seriously here , I think that David Samson has to answer for that . And [ that \u2019 s ] hopefully what our Senate committee will get to .\nThe fact that Pat Foye \u2019 s email was forwarded to Regina Egea , the fact that Christie \u2019 s counsel was informed about this issue , what does that suggest about the governor \u2019 s relationship to this ?\nIt suggests to me that there \u2019 s a lot of people involved who in the least , if they didn \u2019 t know beforehand , at least knew enough about it to ask questions , to find out what went on . And they have absolutely shirked their responsibilities .\nHad they answered the question when I originally posed them , back in September , maybe you and I wouldn \u2019 t be talking right now . And [ said then ] , \u201c Well , there \u2019 s a rogue by the name of David Wildstein , he did this all by himself. \u201d [ But ] it wasn \u2019 t David Wildstein that sent the email . He received the email by Bridget Kelly that said time to create traffic . So you know , just the lack of good sense here is appalling .\nWhen Gov . Christie said in his press conference , \u201c We did n't even know about the existence of the email . I found that out for the first time at 8:50 yesterday morning , \u201d is that credible to you ?\nNo . It \u2019 s absolutely not credible . As I \u2019 ve said , if you didn \u2019 t know about it in advance , he got a copy of a letter from me on Sept. 19 \u2013 [ to ] which I never received a reply . So it \u2019 s not credible .\nIs it credible that he would have fired Bridget Kelly for lying to him , and he never asked her why ? Is it credible that as of Dec. 2 he was still standing in a press conference claiming that there were dedicated lanes in Fort Lee that \u201c sauced \u201d him ? They tried to change this into somehow it should make everybody else mad that Fort Lee had some kind of private roads to the George Washington Bridge , which is a patent lie . And Dec. 2 , he was still talking about it .\nSo tell me what these people are doing : Either they purposely went along with the lie , or they didn \u2019 t know it was a lie and they never bothered to check it out .\nChris Christie either did not tell the truth when he said he didn \u2019 t know about it , or he didn \u2019 t want to know . Either way , that \u2019 s an indictment of his managerial style or an indictment of his truthfulness . What was he doing between Sept. 13 when this took place , and his press conference of three or four days ago ?\nIs there a point at which the governor should resign ?\nI \u2019 m not going to predict that the governor should resign . I think we need to find a lot more out here .\nBut I think the governor has things to answer for .",
