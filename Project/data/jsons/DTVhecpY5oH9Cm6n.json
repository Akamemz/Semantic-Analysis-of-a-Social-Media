    "content": "We are not in a full-scale war . We are not in a recession or fighting a high unemployment rate . But the federal government is spending as if we were a teenager with a parent 's credit card . Trillion-dollar deficits are coming back soon , so this is the perfect moment to start talking about government austerity .\nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office , even before taking under consideration the budget impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the added spending from the budget deals , we are about three years away from the next $ 1 trillion deficit . Also , this year , the Department of the Treasury will inevitably have to borrow hundreds of billions of dollars to pile on top of our already eye-popping $ 20.6 trillion of gross debt , which is public debt plus the debt the federal government owes to other accounts , such as Social Security . That 's over 100 percent of our gross domestic product . It will also have to request yet another increase to its borrowing limit .\nStrikingly , President Donald Trump made zero mention of the debt or the growing deficits during his State of the Union address . However , he did n't fail to ask for new spending on infrastructure , another job training program to be added to the dozens of existing and inefficient ones , immigration enforcement , and a wall on the southern border . And he asked for more defense spending than he is currently allowed to have .\nThere was no mention of how we would pay for all of that stuff , and he even mentioned more tax cuts . ( Obamacare taxes , I am looking at you . ) For those reasons , it 's high time to ask that this administration and Congress make the federal budget lean again .\nAt this point , many of you may think I am delusional . Indeed , a look at budget numbers reveals that when Republicans are in control of Congress and the White House , special interests that feed at the teat of government have nothing to fear . Government continues to grow . You get some tax cuts and a few military operations but no spending cuts or reforms to the entitlement state . In fact , you may get a new entitlement program , such as Medicare Part D or paid family leave .\nNonetheless , it is worth trying to fight for fiscal responsibility by reminding elected officials that debt and deficits are n't good . They 're expensive . They slow the economy over time . They make it more difficult to respond to true emergencies . And they make it likelier that tax cuts will be undone in the future . They are also unfair to the future generations that will pay for them with lower growth , fewer jobs and higher taxes .\nThe great news is that if lawmakers decided to do the right thing , we would know what to do . There is not only a large amount of literature but also a consensus among economists about what fiscal adjustment packages are the most effective at reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio with the lowest level of short-term costs .\nFirst , based on past experiences in developing countries , we know that spending-based adjustments are more successful than tax-based adjustments at reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio . They also last longer .\nSecond , consolidations based on spending cuts are more effective if they focus on reforming entitlement programs . Spending-based adjustments , unlike tax-based ones , also lead to long-term growth .\nThird , spending-based packages can sometimes encourage economic growth in the short term . Tax-based ones never do .
