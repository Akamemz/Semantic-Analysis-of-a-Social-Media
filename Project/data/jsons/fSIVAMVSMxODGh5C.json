    "content": "Donald Trump has emerged as the front-runner for the GOP nomination by winning over roughly a third of Republicans in the early voting states and in preference polls , packing his rallies with men and women , evangelical Christians and military veterans , blue-collar workers and wealthy retirees .\nHis critics have argued for months he 'll never be able to grow that wide-but-only-so-deep coalition by clashing with Pope Francis , attacking former President George W. Bush and skipping debates like he did once in Iowa . His negatives , they say , are just too high .\nBut a new AP-GfK poll finds registered Republicans and GOP-leaning voters put Trump at the top of the still-unwieldy GOP field when it comes to which candidate fits best with their stand on the issues . They give Trump the best marks for competence and decisiveness .\nFar more Republicans than not say they 'd vote for Trump in the general election , and 86 percent of Republican voters think he can win in November \u2014 giving him a 15 percentage point advantage over his nearest rival .\nIf the number of Republican candidates shrinks as expected after Saturday 's primary in South Carolina , Tuesday 's Nevada caucuses and on Super Tuesday on March 1 , the Trump coalition , it would appear , has plenty of room to grow .\n`` He understands what the problems are and he conveys that in a way that attracts blacks , whites and Democrats and Jews and Christians and independents and a lot of conservatives and a lot of evangelicals , '' said Ed McMullen , a Trump co-chairman in South Carolina . `` When you really assess the base of who 's out there for Mr. Trump and why it 's there , it 's there because he 's got the message that they 're looking for . ''\nPredictions of Trump 's inevitable political demise have arrived almost daily since the brash real estate mogul jumped into the White House race . They came again after last weekend 's GOP debate , when Trump aggressively went after Bush as a president who failed to protect the country from terrorism . `` The World Trade Center came down during the reign of George Bush , '' he said . `` He kept us safe ? That is not safe . ''\nBarry Wynn , a national fundraising leader for Bush 's brother , Trump rival Jeb Bush , said the moment `` crystallized that if you 're for Trump , you 're still for Trump . ''\n`` But it also raised negatives among everybody else , '' he said . `` Eventually you have to pay for that . ''\nIndeed , only 42 percent of Republicans consider Trump likable and only 32 percent consider him compassionate . The AP-GfK poll found Trump and Jeb Bush are nearly tied as the candidates with the highest unfavorable ratings within their own party , with only 4 in 10 GOP voters seeing Trump in a positive light .\nBy comparison , Florida Sen. Marco Rubio leads the field in terms of favorability and likability . But he 's yet to come close to the top of the pack , perhaps because those same voters put `` likability '' at the bottom of their list of priorities , with just half of GOP respondents calling it important .\nCompetence and decisiveness , the measures on which Trump dominates , were important to more than 9 out of 10 Republican voters .\nJoan Brewer , a 70-year-old retiree from Garden City , South Carolina , is an evangelical Christian voter leaning toward casting her ballot on Saturday for Trump . She acknowledged `` that mouth may get him into trouble , '' but she may be willing to look past his penchant for controversy to get the leader she thinks the country needs .\n`` This country is in trouble , '' Brewer said . `` I want it to be Trump . We need it to be Trump . ''\nMcMullen rejected the impression that Trump 's supporters are only a bunch of `` lower-income , angry white men '' and `` rednecks , '' pointing to a series of campaign events in recent days at exclusive golf resorts and gated communities in South Carolina that attracted wealthy retirees and business leaders .\n`` The moment he started having events that brought 5,000 or 10,000 people in a room , you had African-Americans , you had independents , '' he said . `` I mean , it was always 50-50 men-women . ''\nWhile the AP-GfK poll suggests Trump can broaden his support to win the nomination , it also suggests his coalition has some limits .\nAmong all registered voters nationally , 6 in 10 say they have an unfavorable opinion of Trump and 54 percent say they would n't even consider voting for him in a general election . Perhaps most troubling for Trump is that he finishes at the bottom of the GOP field among Americans who are Hispanic , with just 16 percent viewing him favorably .\nThose numbers will almost surely have to improve for Trump to be a competitive general election candidate . Hispanic voters are expected to grow to close to 12 percent of the electorate in November .\nTrump 's most ardent backers , however , have faith he will expand his appeal .\n`` I do n't think he represents a particular side of the aisle , '' said Susan Simon , a resident of the Sun City retirement community in Bluffton , South Carolina , and a Democrat who intends to vote for Trump on Saturday . `` I hope he can get rid of that gridlock and get things accomplished and not fighting that it has to be a Republican win or a Democratic win . It should be a U.S.A . win .
