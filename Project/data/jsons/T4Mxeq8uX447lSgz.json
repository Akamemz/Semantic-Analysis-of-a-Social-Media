John McCain , Kelly Ayotte and John Thune , rescind their support for Trump . Republican leaders , including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Trump \u2019 s own running mate , Mike Pence , condemned the remarks .\nBut Trump remained defiant . After stating he will never drop out of the race , and slamming Republican defectors , he has sought to focus on accusations of sexual assault levied at Bill Clinton , who is not running for president .\nThe town hall style debate is moderated by ABC \u2019 s Martha Raddatz and CNN \u2019 s Anderson Cooper .\nRight from the start , the disdain the two nominees have for each other was apparent . As they entered the debate hall to applause , Clinton and Trump did not shake hands . Clinton merely nodded at Trump , who slowed when it became clear that she would not be extending her hand . Then they simply stood , somewhat awkwardly , a few feet apart , as the crowd applauded .\nWhen Trump was pressed by Anderson Cooper if he had actually done the things he claimed to do in a recently leaked audio \u2014 like groping women \u2019 s genitals without their consent \u2014 Trump responded : \u201c No , I have not . \u201d\nThe declaration came after Trump initially denied having said that he had demonstrated such behavior .\n\u201c No , I didn \u2019 t say that at all , \u201d Trump said in response to Cooper \u2019 s question about the tape . \u201c This was locker room talk . \u201d\n\u201c This is locker room talk , \u201d Trump repeated over and over .\nHe then began to list atrocities committed by ISIS , such as beheadings . He then pivoted back to the tape .\n\u201c Yes , I \u2019 m very embarrassed by it , I hate it , but it \u2019 s locker room talk , \u201d Trump said . \u201c I will knock the hell out of ISIS . \u201d\n\u201c I spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw , \u201d Clinton said in response to Trump \u2019 s comments . \u201c You know , with prior Republican nominees for president , I disagreed with them on politics , policies and principles , but I never quiet their fitness to serve . Donald Trump is different . \u201d\nShe then went on to note other groups Trump has targeted with vitriol .\n\u201c It 's not only women , \u201d Clinton said . \u201c Because he has also targeted immigrants , African-Americans , Latinos , people with disabilities , POWs , Muslims and so many others . So this is who Donald Trump is . \u201d\nIt did not take Trump long to invoke allegations of sexual assault against Bill Clinton , who is not running for president .\n\u201c Never anyone in the history of politics in the nation that has been so abusive to women , \u201d Trump said of Bill Clinton . \u201c Bill Clinton was abusive to women . \u201d\n\u201c Hillary Clinton attacked those same women viciously , four of them here tonight , \u201d Trump said . Trump invited four women to attend , including three who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault . The other was raped when she was 12 years-old by a man who was defended in court by a young Hillary Clinton .\n\u201c I think it 's disgraceful and she should be ashamed of herself if you want to know the truth , \u201d Trump said .\nClinton ignored Trump \u2019 s broadsides against her husband , who is not a candidate for president .\n\u201c First let me start by saying that so much of what he just said is not right , but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses , \u201d Clinton said . \u201c He gets to decide what he wants to talk about instead of answering people 's questions and laying out the plans that we think can make a better and a better country . That 's his choice . When I hear something like that , I am reminded of what my friend Michelle Obama advised us all . When they go low , you go high . \u201d\nShe went on to say that Trump never apologizes , including for his lie about the president \u2019 s birthplace .\nTrump shot back that Clinton is the one who should apologize for the birther lie , and then stated that Michelle Obama is not actually Clinton \u2019 s friend .\nHe said Barack Obama beat Clinton fairly in the 2008 Democratic primary , but that Clinton won by cheating during the primary in 2016 .

There has never been so many lies , so much exception . There has never been anything like it .
