Katie Hill , D-Calif. , who also serves as the liason to the Democratic leadership , additionally charged that the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) erred by blocking Fox News from hosting any Democratic primary debates , saying the move does n't do anything to `` help '' the growing partisan tensions .\nHill 's comments came as Cohen 's own lawyer , Lanny Davis , has sought to clarify Cohen 's statements before the House oversight panel , even as Davis insists Cohen tesified truthfully . Several Republicans have accused Cohen of perjury on a variety of matters , and on Thursday , House Oversight Committee Republicans referred Cohen to the DOJ for alleged perjury .\nBut a perjury referral by Democrats , who control the committee , would mark a major escalation for Cohen 's potential legal jeopardy . Fox News exclusively reported on Friday , citing two sources familiar with the matter , that Cohen met with staff for Adam Schiff , D-Calif. , for more than 10 hours before his testimony . In addition to his public remarks , Cohen has met with the House panel several times behind closed doors .\nEven as she seemingly acknowledged that Democrats `` ca n't go anywhere '' on impeaching President Trump at the moment , Hill indicated that Cummings had more than enough justification to request another criminal probe into Cohen , who has already pleaded guilty to lying to Congress in 2017 concerning the duration of negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow .\nSCHIFF STAFF WENT TO NEW YORK FOUR TIMES TO MEET WITH COHEN FOR MORE THAN 10 HOURS -- FOR TESTIMONY LASTING ONLY 7 HOURS , SOURCES SAY .
