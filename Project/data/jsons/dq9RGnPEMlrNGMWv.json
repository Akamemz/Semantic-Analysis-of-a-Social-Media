    "content": "If you look at polling data , there are a few issues on which Republican voters seem to have changed their beliefs since Donald Trump began his campaign for the presidency .\nIn 2015 , just 12 percent of Republicans held a favorable view of Russian President Vladimir Putin , according to Gallup . Now 32 percent of Republicans like him , the firm found in a February poll .\nOr take the issue of free trade : Historically , conservatives have been in favor of it . But from 2015 to 2017 , Republican support of free trade dropped from 56 percent in 2015 to just 36 percent in 2017 , according to Pew .\nIt \u2019 s easy to look at these changing poll numbers and see something blatantly hypocritical \u2014 that these Americans are knowingly giving in to Trump rhetoric praising Putin and belittling free trade , betraying their former ideals .\nBut new research from psychology suggests something else is probably going on : Many political beliefs are fickle , and people probably don \u2019 t realize it when they change their minds .\nMichael Wolfe , a memory and learning researcher at Grand Valley State University in Michigan , recently published an experiment in the Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology that found when people change their mind on a subject , they have a hard time recalling that they ever felt another way .\nIt \u2019 s an intriguing finding in part because it affirms that people think their beliefs are more stable than they actually are . Which means they may be less open to information that conflicts with their belief .\nIt \u2019 s also further evidence that despite what we may think , we don \u2019 t hold consistent ideological views . We tend to agree with whatever our leaders agree with , which is particularly worrying with Donald Trump as president , as I described in a recent story about how conservatives are realigning their views with his .\nWolfe ran the study on a sample of a few hundred college students , using as a topic the effectiveness of spanking as a disciplinary measure . This subject was chosen for a few reasons : It \u2019 s one that many people have an opinion on , but it \u2019 s not so partisan or political that people would be totally unwilling to change their beliefs . It \u2019 s also a topic on which it \u2019 s relativity easy to find evidence both for and against .\nFirst , Wolfe and his co-author asked the participants if they believed spanking is effective on a scale of 1 to 9 . A few months later , they brought the participants into the lab to read arguments for or against spanking . After the prompt , the students were asked to again rate their feelings about spanking . But here \u2019 s the key : They were also asked to recall what they first thought about spanking , several months back .\nOn average , the students changed their minds when they read an argument that was counter to their initial belief . But most didn \u2019 t remember . It was just easier to remember the text they \u2019 d just read than to think back on their past opinions .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t go in and grab a memory like opening up a word file or reading it off a tape , \u201d Wolfe explains . \u201c But rather , if you ask a person at a particular time to report their belief , they construct their belief at that moment based on a combination of things that are easily available to them at that time . \u201d\nMemories aren \u2019 t retrieved ; they \u2019 re constructed with cognitive shortcuts . And when memories are constructed , we can \u2019 t easily see the seams . We don \u2019 t notice that they \u2019 ve changed .\n\u201c When people try to remember a previous belief , information that \u2019 s available at a moment biases their ability to remember this old information , \u201d Wolfe says . \u201c They end up thinking their current belief is very similar to their previous belief . \u201d\nHere \u2019 s the key chart from the study . On the right , it shows that when a participant reads a text that counters what they initially believed , they \u2019 re around 2 points more likely on a 9-point scale to endorse it . Then look at the \u201c recollection \u201d scores . That \u2019 s their guess for what their original answer was . It \u2019 s much more similar to their post-reading answer than it is to the initial response .\nOther studies show we have a bias to believe that our past selves are more similar to our current selves than they actually are . People in romantic relationships that have gone sour tend to misremember the fact that they were ever happy with their partners . Our memories of the past are constructed with information available in our immediate present \u2014 and we often confuse immediacy and familiarity with truth . Just repeating a lie once can make it more accepted as truth .\nThere \u2019 s also this fun study , published in PLOS One in 2013 . In it , researchers gave participants an opinion poll to fill out , and then sneakily changed their answers . When they gave back the polls , the participants didn \u2019 t realize their answers had been changed . \u201c A full 92 percent of the participants accepted and endorsed our altered political survey score , \u201d the researchers concluded .\nThis has huge implications for how we interpret public opinion polls\nThere are some caveats to Wolfe \u2019 s experiment . First is that it was conducted on college students , who don \u2019 t necessarily generalize to the rest of the population . Second , this topic \u2014 meta-awareness of belief change \u2014 isn \u2019 t studied all that often , so some follow-up is needed .\nAnd third is that college students may not care all that much about spanking , can be easily swayed , and don \u2019 t care enough to recall anything else . We \u2019 d have better awareness if we changed our minds on a topic that is more deeply connected to our identity \u2014 like access to abortion or belief in climate change .\nBut that third point isn \u2019 t all that much of a caveat , if you consider how we generally think about wonky issues in politics \u2014 which is not all that often or all that deeply . As political scientist Gabriel Lenz finds in a forthcoming paper in the Journal of Politics , only about 20 to 40 percent of the public holds stable views on policy . Many of us just take cues from leaders , and our parties , in forming our opinions .\nIn this light , it \u2019 s not super surprising that so many more Republicans are now against the concept of free trade .\n\u201c A lot of people don \u2019 t know how the parties describe themselves , \u201d Lenz says . \u201c And when they learn my party \u2019 s conservative [ or is against free trade , etc . ] , they start saying they \u2019 re conservative too . ... It \u2019 s very hard to find instances where prior policy views seem to drive later voting or decisions . \u201d\nThe revelation of this , that our memories are tinged by how we feel in the present , paints public opinion polls in a new light .\nRecently , I reported on a public opinion poll that found 59 percent of respondents said we \u2019 re currently living through the lowest point in US history that they could remember . In the article , I didn \u2019 t consider the possibility that the participants were misremembering , that their immediate displeasure about the state of the country masked over any memory of worse times .\nThe lesson here : When people answer public opinion polls , they rely on mental shortcuts . They may replace a hard question ( \u201c How do I feel about international trade taxes ? \u201d ) with an easy question ( \u201c What team am I on , and how would they answer this question ? \u201d ) .\n\u201c These shortcuts can be political ideology ; it could be religiosity , deference to scientific authority , \u201d says Dominique Brossard , a psychologist who studies public opinion at the University of Wisconsin . \u201c People don \u2019 t see themselves as being irrational doing this . \u201d\nSo that big public opinion shift in Republicans I mentioned at the top of this piece ? It \u2019 s both meaningful and not . It \u2019 s not meaningful because the participants in the survey , to some extent , are just mirroring Trump \u2019 s priorities as a leader . But it is meaningful because politicians like Trump can use the public opinion poll as proof that there \u2019 s a groundswell of support for these issues . Likewise , it \u2019 s provocative to say now that it \u2019 s the lowest point in recent US history , according to a majority of Americans . But without a recording of how these people actually felt decades ago , we can \u2019 t know .",
