That war\u2014and the manner in which the United States left it behind in 2011\u2014shifted the balance of power in the region in Iran \u2019 s favor . Regional competition , of which Iran \u2019 s tension with Saudi Arabia is the main but not only dimension , exacerbated existing fault-lines , with support for extreme sectarian actors , including the Islamic State , turning local grievances over poor governance into proxy wars .\nNothing that happened in Iraq after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003 was pre-ordained ; different futures than the one unfolding today were possible . Recall that violence declined drastically during the 2007 U.S. troop surge , and that for the next couple of years both Iraq and the West felt that the country was going in the right direction . But the seeds of Iraq \u2019 s unravelling were sown in 2010 , when the United States did not uphold the election results and failed to broker the formation of a new Iraqi government . As an adviser to the top U.S. general in Iraq , I was a witness .\n\u201c My greatest fear , \u201d General Raymond Odierno , the then commanding general of U.S. forces in Iraq , told me in early 2010 , \u201c is that we stabilize Iraq , then hand it over to the Iranians in our rush to the exit . \u201d\nGeneral O ( as he is known ) , had recently watched the 2007 movie Charlie Wilson \u2019 s War , which recounts how U.S. interest in Afghanistan ceased once the mujahedeen defeated the Soviet Army in 1989 and drove them out . Now , he had a premonition that the same could happen in Iraq . \u201c I \u2019 ve invested too much here , \u201d he said , \u201c to simply walk away and let that happen . \u201d\nI had first met Odierno in 2003 , when he was the commanding general of the 4th Infantry Division responsible for the provinces of Salah al-Din , Diyala and Kirkuk in the early days of the Iraq War ; I had been the representative in Kirkuk of the Coalition Provisional Authority , the American-led transitional government that controlled Iraq after Hussein \u2019 s fall . Now , as his political adviser , I was helping General O ensure that the United States kept its focus on the mission in Iraq while drawing down U.S. forces .\nOdierno wanted U.S. engagement with Iraq to continue for years to come , but led by U.S. civilians , not the military . He believed that , in order to train Iraqi security forces and provide the psychological support needed to maintain a level of stability , 20,000 or so U.S. troops needed to stay in Iraq beyond 2011 , when all American troops were scheduled to be withdrawn . But the real engagement , General O believed , should be from the other instruments of national power , led by the U.S. embassy .\nEvery time a congressional delegation visited us in Baghdad , General O put up a slide showing why the United States should continue to invest in Iraq through the Strategic Framework Agreement that the two countries had signed in 2008 . General O knew that for the mission to succeed , there needed to be a political agreement between Iraqi leaders . Otherwise , all the security gains that the American troops had fought so hard for would not be sustainable . He took every opportunity to educate and communicate these complexities to the new Obama administration .\nFor six months , General O had tried hard to support the leadership of Chris Hill , the new American ambassador who had taken up his post in April 2009 . But Odierno had begun to despair . It was clear that Hill , though a career diplomat , lacked regional experience and was miscast in the role in Baghdad . In fact , he had not wanted the job , but Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had persuaded him to take it ; she admitted as much to General O , he told me , when he met her in early 2010 in Washington to discuss the dysfunction at the embassy . General O complained that Hill did not engage with Iraqis or with others in the diplomatic community\u2014his only focus appeared to be monitoring the activities of the U.S. military .\nIt was frightening how a person could so poison a place . Hill brought with him a small cabal who were new to Iraq and marginalized all those with experience in the country . The highly knowledgeable and well-regarded Arabist Robert Ford had cut short his tour as ambassador to Algeria to return to Iraq for a third tour and turned down another ambassadorship to stay on in Iraq and serve as Hill \u2019 s deputy . But Hill appeared not to want Ford \u2019 s advice on political issues and pressured him to depart the post early in 2010 . In his staff meetings , Hill made clear how much he disliked Iraq and Iraqis . Instead , he was focused on making the embassy \u201c normal \u201d like other U.S. embassies .

Since then , Iraqi politicians had become increasingly fearful of his authoritarian tendencies .
