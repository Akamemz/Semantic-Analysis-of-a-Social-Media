    "content": "Trump \u2019 s alt-right trolls have subjected me and my family to an unending torrent of abuse that I wouldn \u2019 t wish on anyone .\nI distinctly remember the first time I saw a picture of my then-seven-year-old daughter \u2019 s face in a gas chamber . It was the evening of September 17 , 2015 . I had just posted a short item to the Corner calling out notorious Trump ally Ann Coulter for aping the white-nationalist language and rhetoric of the so-called alt-right . Within minutes , the tweets came flooding in . My youngest daughter is African American , adopted from Ethiopia , and in alt-right circles that \u2019 s an unforgivable sin . It \u2019 s called \u201c race-cucking \u201d or \u201c raising the enemy . \u201d\nI saw images of my daughter \u2019 s face in gas chambers , with a smiling Trump in a Nazi uniform preparing to press a button and kill her . I saw her face photo-shopped into images of slaves . She was called a \u201c niglet \u201d and a \u201c dindu. \u201d The alt-right unleashed on my wife , Nancy , claiming that she had slept with black men while I was deployed to Iraq , and that I loved to watch while she had sex with \u201c black bucks. \u201d People sent her pornographic images of black men having sex with white women , with someone photoshopped to look like me , watching .\nWhen we both publicized some of the racist attacks \u2014 I in \u2588\u2588\u2588 and Nancy in the Washington Post \u2014 things took a far more ominous turn . Late the next evening \u2014 while Nancy was , fortunately , offline attending a veterans \u2019 charity event in D.C. \u2014 the darker quarters of the alt-right found her Patheos blog . Several different accounts began posting images and GIFs of extreme violence in her comments section .\nClick on a post and scroll down and you \u2019 ll see pictures of black men shooting other black men , close-up images of suicides , GIFs of grisly executions \u2014 the kinds of psyche-scarring things that one can \u2019 t \u201c unsee. \u201d Had I not deployed to Iraq and witnessed death up close , the images would have shocked me . I quickly got on the phone with Nancy , told her not to look at her website , and got busy deleting comments and blocking IP addresses , but in the meantime a few friends and neighbors had seen the posts .\nThe next Sunday , friends from church approached , expressing concern not just for our safety but for theirs as well . We live in a community where most of the streets have similar names , and it \u2019 s common for UPS drivers , FedEx deliveries , and friends to end up at the wrong house . They interpreted the images as threats , and they didn \u2019 t want anyone to drive into our neighborhood , looking for the Frenches , intent on turning image into reality .\nIt took days \u2014 and hundreds of IP blocks and Twitter reports \u2014 but things finally calmed down . The racist images slowed from a flood to a trickle , I relaxed a bit at night , and life returned , I thought , to normal . I was wrong . Our \u201c normal \u201d had changed . This wasn \u2019 t the beginning of the end of our troubles , but rather the end of the beginning .\nI share my family \u2019 s story not because we are unique or because our experience is all that extraordinary , but rather because it is depressingly , disturbingly ordinary this campaign season . The formula is simple : Criticize Trump \u2014 especially his connection to the alt-right \u2014 and the backlash will come .\nErick Erickson experienced his own ordeal more than a month before we did . After Erickson dis-invited Trump from his Red State gathering , angry Trump supporters showed up at his house . A grown man yelled at his children at a store , condemning their father for opposing Trump . Erickson wrote in the New York Times that his son is still fearful that Trump supporters will come back to their home .\nIn March , writer Bethany Mandel related her own experience . After tweeting about Trump \u2019 s anti-Semitic followers , she was called \u201c slimy Jewess \u201d and told that she \u201c deserves the oven. \u201d It got worse :\nNot only was the anti-Semitic deluge scary and graphic , it got personal . Trump fans began to \u201c dox \u201d me \u2014 a term for adversaries \u2019 attempt to ferret out private or identifying information online with malicious intent . My conversion to Judaism was used as a weapon against me , and I received death threats in my private Facebook mailbox , prompting me to file a police report .\nThe phenomenon got some attention in the spring , when the Daily Beast reported not just on Mandel \u2019 s experience but also on Erickson \u2019 s , Rick Wilson \u2019 s , and others \u2019 . It \u2019 s showing no signs of slowing down , either : Big names , small names , any names \u2014 if you attack Trump , no matter who you are , your life might just change .\nEarlier this month , Mi-Ai Parrish , president of the Arizona Republic , wrote a powerful response to the deluge of threats and bullying prompted by the paper \u2019 s endorsement of Hillary Clinton . An Anti-Defamation League report identified 800 journalists who \u2019 ve been targeted with anti-Semitic tweets , ten journalists ( including NR \u2019 s own Jonah Goldberg ) who \u2019 ve borne the brunt of the attacks , and one \u2014 my friend Ben Shapiro \u2014 who \u2019 s received a staggering amount of hate :\nThanks to the Academy and to my agent . pic.twitter.com/RylzL4ZxBv \u2014 Ben Shapiro ( @ benshapiro ) October 19 , 2016\nWhy Shapiro ? Because he represents the worst of all possible anti-Trumpers \u2014 he \u2019 s a Jewish man who turned on the twin pillars of the alt-right , Trump and Breitbart.com . Shapiro famously resigned from Breitbart when it refused to support reporter Michelle Fields after then\u2013Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski grabbed and pulled Fields in the press scrum at a Trump event .\nMore victims are coming forward . In a painful , vulnerable post , commentator Mickey White writes about how the alt-right came after her and her family , triggering a mental-health crisis . In the face of the abuse , she sought help , but help was slow to come :\nI reached out to people I thought I could trust and to this day I \u2019 m not sure if that was the right thing to do . At the time I was desperate though , as the trolling had increased from mere tweets , to DMs from very random famous accounts . Then e-mails went out to people suggesting that I might harm myself , even though I \u2019 d indicated nothing of the sort . Anyone who responded to me would also be shamed or harassed . I was advised that I was about to be swatted . I contacted my local sheriff and eventually the FBI . As all of this was happening , the people behind these accounts made an ominous threat towards a family member . My sister . The single most important person to me in the world . The fuse was lit .\nThe abuse is so common that I \u2019 ve lost count of other reporters and writers who \u2019 ve told me , often in confidence , of troubling late-night incidents at their homes , or of Tweets and other messages that went far beyond garden-variety Twitter trolling into disturbing threats and sometimes-horrifying images .\nAnd it never seems to stop . It certainly hasn \u2019 t stopped for us . This summer , my name leaked to the press after I spoke with Bill Kristol about the possibility of mounting an independent run for the White House . As expected , Trump fans reacted \u2014 this time with an assist from the mainstream media . Politico reporter Kevin Robillard tweeted an excerpt from an interview about my deployment to Iraq , making it seem ( wrongly ) as if I had prohibited my wife from emailing or speaking with other men while I was downrange :\nSo when David French was in Iraq , he would n't let his wife e-mail men or use Facebook . https : //t.co/F1tEOwE4sc pic.twitter.com/ZOOV52QXUN \u2014 Kevin Robillard ( @ Robillard ) May 31 , 2016\nOnline Trump world took that tweet and transformed it into a campaign of harassment directed against me and my wife that continues to this day \u2014 all of it sexually charged , all of it disturbing . My wife is a tough woman . She \u2019 s a survivor of sexual abuse and assault . The notion that she can no longer open her Twitter timeline without seeing men boasting about having sex with her while I was gone \u2014 or even while I \u2019 m home \u2014 is intolerable . It \u2019 s relentless , and it often gets under even her very thick skin .\nOf course , no story would be complete without a truly ominous threat . The moment we landed back at home after I declined to run for president , she turned on her phone to see an e-mail from a Trump fan , a veteran who informed her that he knew the business end of a gun and told her directly that she should shut her mouth or he \u2019 d take action .\nWe contacted law enforcement , she got her handgun-carry permit , and life returned to the new normal of daily Twitter harassment , until the day this month when an angry voice actually broke into a phone conversation between my wife and her elderly father , screaming about Trump and spewing profanities . My wife was on her iPhone . Her father was on a landline . That launched a brief , anxious search inside my father-in-law \u2019 s home for a potential intruder and yet another call to law enforcement .\nOnline hate has become so common that it \u2019 s almost a point of perverse pride among some pundits . If you don \u2019 t get hateful messages , you must not matter . If you let the hate bother you , then you must be weak . Indeed , in a world where \u201c feeding \u201d the trolls only makes them stronger , admitting that they \u2019 ve hurt you at all represents a victory for the worst of the worst . They relish your pain , and you don \u2019 t want them to relish anything .\nBut I \u2019 ll be honest : It \u2019 s miserable . There is nothing at all rewarding , enjoyable , or satisfying about seeing your beautiful young daughter called a \u201c niglet. \u201d There is nothing at all rewarding , enjoyable , or satisfying about seeing man after man after man brag in graphic terms that he has slept with your wife . It \u2019 s unsettling to have a phone call interrupted , watch images of murder flicker across your screen , and read threatening e-mails . It \u2019 s sobering to take your teenage kids out to the farm to make sure they \u2019 re both proficient with handguns in case an intruder comes when they \u2019 re home alone .\nThe misery is compounded when longtime friends and allies dismiss my experiences and the experiences of my colleagues as nothing more than the normal cost of public advocacy . It \u2019 s not . I have contributed to \u2588\u2588\u2588 for more than ten years now , and have been deeply involved in many of America \u2019 s most emotional culture-war battles for more than 20 . I \u2019 ve never experienced anything like this before .\nI have to laugh when people accuse me of opposing Trump because it somehow makes me rich , or because I \u2019 m currying favors with guests at the \u201c elite \u201d cocktail parties that I never actually attend . I oppose Trump not just because he \u2019 s an ignorant demagogue and a naked political opportunist , but also because bigotry and intimidation cling to his campaign . Every campaign attracts its share of fools , cranks , and crazies . But Trump \u2019 s candidacy has weaponized them . Every harassing tweet and every violent threat is like a voice whispering in my ear , telling me to do all that I can to oppose a movement that breeds and exploits such reckless hate .\nTwo weeks ago Nancy and I were enjoying lunch with friends after church . My son \u2019 s football coach asked if \u201c things had calmed down \u201d after the tumult of the summer . I grabbed my phone , said \u201c let \u2019 s see , \u201d and opened my Twitter mentions . I laughed at the first one , a standard profane rant calling me a traitor for opposing Trump , but when my wife looked , her face twisted up in shock . There they were , just below , more tweets from more men , aimed directly at her . She burst into tears .\nSo , no , things have not \u201c calmed down , \u201d and I \u2019 m always amused when people tell me that I belong to Never Trump because it makes me feel good about myself . There \u2019 s nothing that gives me pleasure about this election season . But if I can do anything to expose and oppose this latest debasement of our politics and culture , and to defend my wife and daughter , then at least I will have purpose .",
