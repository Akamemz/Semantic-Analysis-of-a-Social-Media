    "content": "The illegal immigrant caravan has turned into a real standoff in Mexico .\nThe U.S. government says it \u2019 s all full-up at the San Ysidro port of entry and can \u2019 t process the caravan participants . They \u2019 ll have to wait their turn \u2014 or give up and remain in Mexico , or head home to Central America .\nCaravan organizers , though , vow to outlast the U.S. government . They say they \u2019 re stunned American officials weren \u2019 t prepared to handle them , given that the caravan has made front page news for more than a month . But if it takes waiting in order to get in the asylum line , that \u2019 s what the caravan \u2019 s participants will do .\nAt the White House on Monday President Trump showed frustration with the situation , and seemed particularly peeved by photographs and video showing people associated with the caravan straddling the border fence in San Diego , taunting watchful U.S. authorities .\n\u201c We \u2019 re doing the best we can with it . But we have to have changes in Congress , \u201d Mr. Trump said at a press conference alongside the president of Nigeria where he lamented the people who were able to mount the current fence . \u201c We need a wall . \u201d\nThe caravan , which mustered in southern Mexico in late March , has been winding its way north in the weeks since . Made up chiefly of Hondurans , the participants say they \u2019 re fleeing poor conditions at home , including gang violence , and say they deserve asylum in the U.S .\nSEE ALSO : At least 30 illegals with ties to caravan arrested after jumping U.S. border\nThey arrived in Tijuana last week and on Sunday approached the San Ysidro port of entry into San Diego , the border \u2019 s busiest crossing , where they planned to formally ask to be admitted . U.S. officials , though , said they didn \u2019 t have the capacity to deal with the cases , and told the caravan it would have to wait \u2014 or leave .\n\u201c The number of inadmissible individuals we are able to process in a day varies based on the complexity of the cases , resources available , medical needs , translation requirements , holding/detention space , overall port volume and enforcement actions , \u201d Customs and Border Protection said in a statement late Monday . \u201c As in the past when we \u2019 ve had to limit the number of people we can bring in for processing at a given time , we expect that this will be a temporary situation . \u201d\n\u201c Despite attempts by the local police and immigration agencies to persuade the families to leave the plaza , the group of mothers and fathers voted last night to remain in the plaza right outside the port of entry , until CBP is willing to follow the law and process their requests , \u201d Pueblo Sin Fronteras , the organizer , announced on Facebook .\nThe group posted an email address and phone number for Sidney Aki , the port director for CBP , and urged supporters to send messages demanding action .\n\u201c CBP is the largest law enforcement agency in the country , and is able to detain , transport and incarcerate thousands of people in a day , but is pretending that they don \u2019 t have the \u2018 capacity \u2019 to accept 150 refugee parents and children whose arrival has been anticipated and communicated weeks in advance , \u201d Pueblo Sin Fronteras said .\nBorder agents said the caravan is playing it smart so far . If participants they had rushed the border , they could have been arrested for attempting to enter illegally .
