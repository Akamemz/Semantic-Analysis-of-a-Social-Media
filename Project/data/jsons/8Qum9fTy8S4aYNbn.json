    "content": "Is It 2016 Yet ? Moves By Hillary Clinton & Rand Paul Suggest Yes\nIf you have any interest in politics at all , you pretty much know two things . One , that the next presidential election , on Nov. 8 , 2016 , is only 1,324 days away . And two , you wo n't be surprised if people are focusing on it in March of 2013 .\nSometimes the speculation is silly , but sometimes it 's not . Judging from what we 've seen and heard from Hillary Clinton and Rand Paul , the speculation may be on target .\nThe two may be miles apart ideologically but they do have at least one thing in common : both have been talked about as White House contenders from the moment they began thinking about public office , probably because of their last name . `` Hillary for President '' boosters date back to at least 1992 , when her husband , then the governor of Arkansas , was running for president himself . But once his two terms were over , serious focus on Hillary began . The only First Lady ever in history to seek office , she was elected to the Senate in 2000 and considered running for president in 2004 . She declined , won re-election in '06 , and of course went for all the marbles in 2008 , losing to Barack Obama in a classic marathon battle for the Democratic nomination .\nRand Paul 's rise has been even more dramatic . A relative unknown when he announced for the Senate from Kentucky in 2010 \u2014 about all we knew was that he was an ophthalmologist and son of libertarian favorite Ron Paul \u2014 he upset Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell 's choice in the primary and then went on to win the seat in November . And with his father making one last presidential hurrah in 2012 before retiring from the House , many supporters of the dad seemed to quickly gravitate to the son .\nRand Paul 's timing could not be better . The party could n't get rid of Mitt Romney quickly enough ; he seemed to be old news the moment Obama claimed victory for a second term ( or at least after Karl Rove conceded Ohio ) . And his foreign policy views \u2014 the anti-foreign entanglements position that had long been described as `` isolationist '' and out-of-the-GOP mainstream , views that got his father attention , if not votes \u2014 are now being embraced by more and more Republicans , especially in the wake of the disastrous Iraq and Afghanistan experiences .\nSo when Rand Paul gets up in the Senate and gabs on for most of 13 hours questioning the constitutionality of the Obama administration 's drone program ( or more specifically , the legality of it being used on American targets in America ) , people stood up and took notice . When Paul spoke at the recent CPAC event and said it 's time to ease penalties for illegal drug use \u2014 a true libertarian position \u2014 he not only broke with the GOP 's longstanding lock-em-up philosophy but he also made a point of connecting with younger voters , a group that neither Romney nor 2008 nominee John McCain was successful at wooing .\nAnd then came his speech last Tuesday before the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce , in which he kind of ( but did n't really , or did he ? ) talked about a new pathway for the millions of people who are in the country illegally . I 'm still not convinced what he actually said , but the headlines everywhere said he `` offered '' a plan to solve the immigration problem . Regardless of its content , it led to countless stories about him in a position to run for president in 2016 .\nToo soon to be talking about him in those terms ? How about this : Was it too soon to talk about Obama running for president after his keynote speech at the 2004 Democratic convention \u2014 before he was even elected to the Senate ?\nMeanwhile , if there were any doubts about Hillary Clinton 's intentions for 2016 , they seemed to disappear last week when she appeared in a video for the Human Rights Campaign and announced that yes , she supports same-sex marriage .\nIf Rand Paul is ahead of his party on foreign policy and drug laws , Hillary Clinton seems to be trailing hers on gay marriage . It 's been a year since the president and vice president ( in reverse order ) announced their positions/evolving . Other possible Dem prez hopefuls , such as Maryland 's Martin O'Malley and New York 's Andrew Cuomo , also endorsed marriage equality last year . In fact , it seems like everyone in the party has come to that conclusion before she did .\nNow , in fairness , she was not about to spell out her views while she was secretary of state these past four years . But the video , which you can see here courtesy of YouTube , did have a `` do n't forget me '' feel to it .\nAnd so , the question everyone has been asking , quite legitimately , is what her announcement has to do with her calculations about 2016 \u2014 and whether she is playing catchup . Here 's the take of Politico 's Maggie Haberman , who called it a `` strong signal she 's very much thinking about her political future , even if a decision on 2016 is not for quite some time '' :\n`` Coming less than three months after she departed the State Department , Clinton 's move was about as surprising as a setting sun . Her party , not to mention her husband and daughter , was already on record as backing gay marriage . Three days earlier , Republican Sen . Rob Portman \u2014 last year a leading contender to be his party 's VP pick \u2014 said he was backing gay marriage after his college-age son came out two years ago . Clinton 's video , released through the Human Rights Campaign \u2014 which is run by longtime Clinton ally Chad Griffin \u2014 was clearly intended to be something of a low-key event . A week ahead of the U.S. Supreme Court hearing , arguments in a gay marriage-related case , the announcement was well-timed . But it also was almost an afterthought in the gay marriage debate that has gone on nationally . And it also opens the door for fresh questions to Clinton on issues of the day , such as immigration and gun control \u2014 not that she 'll need to offer an opinion on any of then until she 's ready . ''\nLest we forget : Hillary Clinton will be 69 years old in 2016 . And that would make her \u2014 were she to win \u2014 the oldest woman ever elected president of the U.S .\nAll of which leads us to another in our series of Political Junkie Fake Polls .\nPolitical Updates . I post periodic political updates during the week \u2014 some serious , some not \u2014 on Twitter . You can follow me at @ kenrudin . Meanwhile , here are some samplings from the mailbag :\nQ : Can Stephen Colbert 's sister win in South Carolina ? \u2014 Ellen Cohen , Philadelphia , Pa .\nA : South Carolina 's 1st Congressional District is solidly Republican ; Mitt Romney carried it by 18 percentage points last year over President Obama . It has n't elected a Democrat since 1978 . Having said that , it is obvious what gives Elizabeth Colbert-Busch a shot in the May 7 general election : the fact that Mark Sanford , should he win the April 2 GOP runoff , will be her opponent . There is something to be said about the politics of redemption , but there 's also something to be said about the politics of betrayal , and Colbert-Busch is hoping that she can make inroads with Republican women .\nIn last Tuesday 's 16-candidate GOP field , Sanford as expected came out on top , with 37 percent . Finishing second was Curtis Bostic , a former member of the Charleston County Council who had the support of many evangelical voters . Sanford will no doubt drown Bostic financially in the next eight days . But if an anti-Sanford sentiment is real and can unite behind Bostic , we could be looking at a close runoff .\nThe odds still say Sanford wins both the runoff and the special election .\nFor 30 years , until his death in December 1970 , the 1st CD was represented by L. Mendel Rivers , a Democrat and the powerful chairman of the House Armed Services Committee . For the decade after that , his successor was his godson , Mendel Davis . But when Davis retired in 1980 , the district turned Republican . Tommy Hartnett , a former Democrat , won the seat in 1980 and held it until 1986 , when he was narrowly defeated in a bid to become lt. gov . He was succeeded by Arthur Ravenel Jr. , a popular local figure who had spent decades building up the Charleston GOP .\nWhen Ravenel decided to run for governor in 1994 , a sizable field of Republican candidates got into the race to replace him . The favorite was Van Hipp , the former S.C. GOP party chair , who finished well on top in the initial primary , but nowhere near enough to win the nomination outright . The candidate who came in second was a real estate investor by the name of Mark Sanford , who ran as an outsider and beat Hipp in the runoff . Sanford said he would only serve three terms and kept to his promise , retiring in 2000 ( but not before becoming part of the group that attempted to oust Speaker Newt Gingrich in 1997 ) .\nHe was followed in the 1st by longtime state Rep. Henry Brown Jr. , a 65-year old businessman whose years in the state legislature were filled with instances of working across party lines . Running without major party opposition in both 2002 and 2004 , the national anti-Republican tide reached even into his district in 2006 . He fell under 60 percent of the vote that year , and in 2008 , running against a wealthy Democratic philanthropist who poured $ 700,000 of her own money into the race and portrayed Brown as out of touch , he was held to 52 percent .\nBrown retired in 2010 and was succeeded by Tim Scott , an African-American Republican who defeated the sons of Strom Thurmond and ex-Gov . Carroll Campbell for the GOP nod . Re-elected in 2012 , Scott was appointed to fill Jim DeMint 's vacated Senate seat in December , which is how we got to this year 's special election .\nQ : Where can I find Jack Pitney 's piece on Republican outreach efforts that you mentioned in the podcast ? \u2014 Joseph McInnis , Fukuoka , Japan\nQ : Neal Conan always mentions it on Talk of the Nation each week , but where can we see the infamous Wall of Shame ? \u2014 Loren Kirkpatrick , Nashville , Tenn .\nPolitical Junkie segment on Talk of the Nation .
