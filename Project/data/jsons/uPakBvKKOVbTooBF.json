Such gender stereotypes may have outlived whatever hinky usefulness they ever had , as stereotypes are wont to do , but beneath the sexual cosplay of Republican executive blue suits versus Democratic mom jeans ( which President Obama was accused of fancying by no less a fashion arbiter than Sarah Palin ) is a forked dynamic deeper than any policy differences or identity politics . Republicans are driven by anger ; Democrats , riven by anxiety . Anger stokes Republicans to lash out , their grievances , real and imaginary , kept at a raging boil by Fox News , Matt Drudge , radio talk-show hosts , and similar mayhem artists . Anxiety pincushions Democrats into a defensive crouch waiting for the ceiling to cave , their blood pressure spiking with every alarming headline in The New York Times , of which there is never a shortage .\nThe party apparatus exploits and exacerbates these fraidy- \u2019 crat jitters . Whenever something major looms\u2014an election , a State of the Union address , a major Senate vote , a gravitational ripple\u2014my e-mail box turns into a Wailing Wall of Democratic fund-raising messages bearing subject lines such as \u201c Worried , \u201d \u201c Be Afraid , \u201d \u201c Why Haven \u2019 t We Heard from You ? , \u201d \u201c All Hope Is Lost , \u201d and \u201c DOOMED , \u201d which isn \u2019 t how General Patton would have fired up the troops . The heebie-jeebie-ing is even worse on social media during the election cycle ; social media make everything worse if you open up the sluices , turning even stoics into headless chickens . A few years ago such Aunt Pittypat palpitations inspired a viral poster that showed President Obama making a bold gesture with the message EVERYONE CHILL THE FUCK OUT , I GOT THIS ! And yet , after nearly two terms of Obama \u2019 s unruffled , unrattled mastery of the long game , his confidence doesn \u2019 t seem to have energized Democrats en masse with a \u201c Forward march ! \u201d spirit . When Democrats contemplate their navel , they still see a panic button .\nNot all Democrats , naturally , otherwise the party would have gone the way of the Pony Express , political architect Karl Rove \u2019 s vision of a permanent Republican majority having come to pass . Yet there does seem to be an intestinal queasiness in the institutional identity that \u2019 s chronic and unworthy of its ancestors . When I was a stripling in the never dull 60s , Democrats didn \u2019 t quaver as if a wagon-train attack lurked around every bend . Activated by adversity , they appeared outgoing , future-striding , and firm-resolved : dashing John F. Kennedy , happy warrior Hubert H. Humphrey , steer-wrangling Lyndon Baines Johnson , and , radiating in the background , the chromo image of Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2014the greatest president , and perhaps the greatest figure , of the 20th century . The Republican adults in charge came across as somberly dour ( Richard Nixon ) or apocalyptically dire ( Barry Goldwater ) . The bloody morass of Vietnam , the urban riots and campus upheavals , the assassinations of J.F.K. , his brother Robert , and Martin Luther King Jr. , and the druggy saturnalia of the decade eroded the faith in liberal progress and took the bright shine off social engineering . When Nixon swept the board in his re-election victory of 1972 over George McGovern , winning 49 states , it was as if a dark visor had been lowered over the future for liberal Democrats , nothing ahead but charred landscape . Undone by hubris and thirsty vengeance , Nixon did the country a favor by befouling himself over Watergate , opening a respite of hope for Democrats ( the improbable success of Jimmy Carter in time for the bicentennial ) , only to have it smushed beneath the golden hammer of Ronald Reagan , with whose two-term presidency the Democrats are still reckoning .\nIt wasn \u2019 t only that Reagan was popular , racking up a second-term victory that equaled Nixon \u2019 s 49-state total and scored the highest electoral-college vote in history ( 525 out of a possible 538 ) , leaving liberals thunderstruck . It wasn \u2019 t only that he was the first pontiff of the unfettered free-market capitalism that has become the economic dogma of our time ( even if the actual record of his administration wouldn \u2019 t pass Ayn Rand \u2019 s inspection ) . Reagan \u2019 s dandiest trick was inverting the personae of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans , turning the character roles inside out . Optimistic , affable , rhetorically broad-gestured and bold-colored , a mega-dose of vitamin D , the former movie star opened a picture window on the majestic vista of \u201c Morning in America , \u201d where the skies were big and blue and the hills alive with the sound of jingle-jangle spurs . In political , media , and public awareness , perceptions turned topsy-turvy , placing Republicans high in the saddle and challenging the horizon while nit-picking , nay-saying Democrats clung to the status quo as if it were the schoolmarm \u2019 s apron strings . A gross caricature , but gross caricatures are what the Beltway press eats for brunch , and , apart from a leonine few , Democrats became gun-shy of proposing any F.D.R./L.B.J.-scaled domestic programs or making anything resembling dovish cries . The party lost labor muscle\u2014Reagan \u2019 s crackdown on the air-traffic controllers \u2019 union in 1981 , when his threat to fire more than 11,000 striking controllers carried the day , was a crippling defeat from which unions never recovered\u2014and shifted attention to knowledge workers , who didn \u2019 t have the same organizational strength and loyalty in the non-unionized , neoliberal economy . \u201c Though [ Michael Dukakis ] lost the [ 1988 ] election after being defamed in the infamous Willie Horton ad \u2026 , his platform won him a following among white-collar professionals in the metropolitan areas of the Sunbelt , West , and Northeast , \u201d historian and political analyst Lily Geismer wrote in the winter 2016 issue of Jacobin magazine . \u201c Four years later , the [ Democratic Leadership Council ] \u2019 s golden boy , Bill Clinton , placed high-tech growth and suburban professionals at the forefront of his policy vision in his own presidential bid. \u201d The \u201c triangulation \u201d strategy and small-ball initiatives ( school uniforms , etc . ) practiced and proposed by Clinton once he was in office weren \u2019 t just wily poker tricks but a recognition of the political realities of the post-Reagan era . Expansive , ebullient , and popular , Clinton was finely tuned to the public \u2019 s mood , sensed just how far to push . Fat lot of good it did him .
