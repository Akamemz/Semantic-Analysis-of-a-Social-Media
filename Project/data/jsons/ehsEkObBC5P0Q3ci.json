As Hamid stood up in silent protest , the supporters around her began to jeer and chant for her to `` get out , '' until Trump campaign officials and police officers interceded to eject her from the arena . One person accused her of having a bomb .\n`` There is hatred against us that is unbelievable , '' Trump said as Hamid was ejected . `` It 's their hatred , it 's not our hatred . ''\nNow , after receiving a king 's welcome in Saudi Arabia on Saturday and ambling from meeting to meeting with the region 's Muslim leaders on Sunday , he appears to be looking to reset relations with the Muslim world .\nTrump chose Saudi Arabia -- home to the world 's two holiest Muslim sites -- for his first overseas trip , in what his top aides have described as an overtly symbolic gesture .\nInstead , Trump let the pictures do the talking , and he almost certainly liked what they were saying .\nOn Sunday , he will deliver a speech to leaders of 50 Muslim countries to outline his vision for US-Muslim relations .\nBut beneath the pageantry and symbolism remains the sting that more than a billion Muslims around the world felt after American voters elected Trump -- a candidate who called for a `` total and complete shutdown of Muslims '' entering the United States , floated the idea of surveilling US mosques and warned that Muslim refugees represented a national security threat .\nJUST WATCHED Travel ban author writes Trump speech on Islam Replay More Videos ...

''\nA US official said the words `` radical Islamic terror '' are n't included in the current draft of Trump 's speech set to be delivered in Saudi Arabia on Sunday . The speech , however , is not in its final form and could change before Trump delivers his remarks .\nThe US official confirmed to CNN the speech will urge Muslim leaders to `` drive out the terrorists from your places of worship '' and cast the fight against radicalism as a battle of `` good and evil .
