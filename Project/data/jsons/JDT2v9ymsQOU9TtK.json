    "content": "In early 2015 , a man who runs a small technology company showed up at Trump Tower to collect $ 50,000 for having helped Michael Cohen , then Donald Trump \u2019 s personal lawyer , try to rig online polls in his boss \u2019 s favor before the presidential campaign .\nIn his Trump Organization office , Mr. Cohen surprised the man , John Gauger , by giving him both a blue Walmart bag containing between $ 12,000 and $ 13,000 in cash and , randomly , a boxing glove that Mr. Cohen said had been worn by a Brazilian mixed-martial arts fighter , Mr. Gauger said .\nMr. Cohen disputed that he handed over a bag of cash . \u201c All monies paid to Mr. Gauger were by check , \u201d he said , offering no further comment on his ties to the consultant .\nIn a tweet on Thursday , Mr. Cohen said Mr. Trump knew he was trying to have the polls rigged . \u201c What I did was at the direction of and for the sole benefit of [ Mr. Trump ] , \u201d Mr. Cohen wrote . \u201c I truly regret my blind loyalty to a man who doesn \u2019 t deserve it . \u201d\nMichael Cohen : Full Coverage Highlights from The Wall Street Journal on Trump 's former lawyer\nRudy Giuliani , a lawyer for Mr. Trump , said of Mr. Cohen \u2019 s tweet : \u201c My response will be a cleaned-up version of \u2018 Bullshit . \u2019 \u201d\n\u201c This is not true . The president did not know about this if it happened , \u201d Mr. Giuliani said in an interview .\nMr. Gauger owns RedFinch Solutions LLC and is chief information officer at Liberty University in Virginia , where Jerry Falwell Jr. , an evangelical leader and fervent Trump supporter , is president .\nMr. Gauger said he never got the rest of what he claimed he was owed . But Mr. Cohen in early 2017 still asked for\u2014and received\u2014a $ 50,000 reimbursement from Mr. Trump and his company for the work by RedFinch , according to a government document and a person familiar with the matter .\nThe reimbursement\u2014made on the sole basis of a handwritten note from Mr. Cohen and paid largely out of Mr. Trump \u2019 s personal account\u2014demonstrates the level of trust the lawyer once had within the Trump Organization , whose officials arranged the repayment .\nThe Trump Organization declined to comment . Mr. Giuliani said : \u201c The real takeaway from your story is , didn \u2019 t he steal $ 37,000 ? \u201d\nThe reimbursement was mentioned by federal prosecutors when they charged Mr. Cohen in August with eight felonies , including campaign-finance violations for arranging hush-money payments to an adult-film star and a Playboy model who allege Mr. Trump had extramarital sexual encounters with them .\nProsecutors wrote in a charging document that when Mr. Cohen asked Trump Organization executives for a $ 130,000 reimbursement for a hush payment he made to Stephanie Clifford , the porn actress known as Stormy Daniels , he also scrawled a handwritten note asking for $ 50,000 he said he spent on \u201c tech services \u201d to aid Mr. Trump \u2019 s campaign . Prosecutors didn \u2019 t name the company providing those services , but people familiar with the matter say it was RedFinch .\nMr. Cohen \u2019 s dealings with the company and Mr. Gauger haven \u2019 t previously been reported .\nMr. Cohen has pleaded guilty to campaign-finance violations , tax evasion , lying to Congress and other charges . He was sentenced last month to three years in prison . None of the charges were connected to his interactions with Mr. Gauger and RedFinch .\nThe episode further illustrates how the former self-described fixer for Mr. Trump , who incriminated the president in the hush payments , once operated in secret to advance his boss \u2019 s political fortunes . Mr. Cohen \u2019 s dealings involving Mr. Trump over the years , including during the 2016 presidential race , will be a focus of Mr. Cohen \u2019 s testimony at a Feb. 7 hearing before the House Oversight Committee .\nMr. Gauger \u2019 s lawyer , Charles E. James Jr. of the firm Williams Mullen , said federal investigators interviewed Mr. Gauger about his interactions over six years with Mr. Cohen , from their first meeting in 2012 until last April , when the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided Mr. Cohen \u2019 s home , office and hotel room .\nMr. Gauger , who recounted those dealings to The Wall Street Journal , said that though Mr. Cohen promised him lucrative work for the presidential campaign , his activities related to Mr. Trump consisted of trying unsuccessfully to manipulate two online polls in Mr. Trump \u2019 s favor .\nDuring the presidential race , Mr. Cohen also asked Mr. Gauger to create a Twitter account called @ WomenForCohen . The account , created in May 2016 and run by a female friend of Mr. Gauger , described Mr. Cohen as a \u201c sex symbol , \u201d praised his looks and character , and promoted his appearances and statements boosting Mr. Trump \u2019 s candidacy .\nWhen Mr. Cohen requested the $ 50,000 reimbursement for technology services , he didn \u2019 t tell Trump Organization executives what specific services were performed , and they didn \u2019 t ask , people familiar with the matter said .\nThe reimbursement he obtained for the deal with Ms. Clifford and the technology work was paid to him over the course of a year and characterized by the Trump Organization as legal fees , though it didn \u2019 t pertain to any legal work he performed at the time , prosecutors said . Overall , Mr. Cohen was paid $ 420,000 , mostly from Mr. Trump \u2019 s personal account , including $ 180,000 to reimburse him for Ms. Clifford and RedFinch , a $ 60,000 bonus , and another $ 180,000 to cover taxes he would owe because the money would be declared as income , according to prosecutors .\nRichard Hasen , an election-law expert and law professor at University of California , Irvine , said Mr. Cohen had an obligation to disclose the payment to RedFinch as an independent expenditure if it was for campaign-related work he didn \u2019 t discuss with the Trump campaign . Had he coordinated with the Trump camp , the campaign would have been required to report any unpaid-for work as an in-kind contribution .\nThe connection between Messrs. Trump and Cohen and Liberty University dates at least to 2012 , when Mr. Falwell invited Mr. Trump to give a speech and Mr. Cohen accompanied him . Soon after , Mr. Gauger was introduced to Mr. Cohen , helped him set up an Instagram account and gave him his cellphone number should he need more assistance , he said .\nOver the next several years , Mr. Cohen asked Mr. Gauger for help with services intended to elevate positive content in internet-search results for himself and for friends , Mr. Gauger said . While he didn \u2019 t pay for most of what Mr. Gauger did , Mr. Cohen often promised to connect RedFinch with executives at Mr. Trump \u2019 s hotel and golf-course businesses , though he never did , Mr. Gauger said .\nIn January 2014 , Mr. Cohen asked Mr. Gauger to help Mr. Trump score well in a CNBC online poll to identify the country \u2019 s top business leaders by writing a computer script to repeatedly vote for him . Mr. Gauger was unable to get Mr. Trump into the top 100 candidates . In February 2015 , as Mr. Trump prepared to enter the presidential race , Mr. Cohen asked him to do the same for a Drudge Report poll of potential Republican candidates , Mr. Gauger said . Mr. Trump ranked fifth , with about 24,000 votes , or 5 % of the total .\nAfter making the cash payment at Trump Tower , Mr. Cohen kept saying he would pay the balance of the $ 50,000 but never did , Mr. Gauger said . Mr. Cohen also promised to get RedFinch work for Mr. Trump \u2019 s campaign . He set up two phone calls for Mr. Gauger with campaign officials , who didn \u2019 t hire him , he said .\n\u201c Mr . Cohen promised but never was able to develop the business he predicted , \u201d said Mr. James , Mr. Gauger \u2019 s lawyer .\nMr. Cohen did give Mr. Gauger some other paying work . Early in 2016 , Mr. Cohen hired RedFinch to help create positive web content about the chief executive of CareOne Management LLC , a New Jersey assisted-living company that had given Mr. Cohen a consulting contract .\nMr. Cohen sent RedFinch checks totaling $ 50,000 for that work , Mr. Gauger said . Mr. Cohen collected $ 200,000 from CareOne but didn \u2019 t pay taxes on it , according to the charging document filed by federal prosecutors , who didn \u2019 t identify the assisted-living company by name . Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to evading taxes on that income . CareOne didn \u2019 t respond to a request for comment .\nMr. Cohen asked Mr. Gauger to create the @ WomenForCohen account , still active in 2019 , to elevate his profile .
