Does this brave new world of sharing clergy represent just a pragmatic solution to burdensome budgets ? Or is it part of a modest reinvention of American religion and its basic building block , the congregation ?\nOne thing is certain : The trend is growing . Some 44 % of the United Methodist Church \u2019 s 45,000 churches now share a pastor . In the United Church of Christ ( UCC ) , which includes Weld and Phillips among its 3,277 congregations , 11.1 % of churches share a pastor , up from 9.4 % in 2016 . Preliminary results from the not-yet-released 2018 National Congregations Study suggest the percentage of churches sharing pastors might be climbing across mainline Protestantism as a whole , according to NCS Director Mark Chaves of Duke University .\nThe main driver is money . Congregations that used to be able to afford full-time clergy can \u2019 t cover the costs of salary and benefits in a time of declining church attendance and lighter offering plates . In 2018 , fully 43 % of mainline churches already had no full-time clergy all to themselves , according to NCS preliminary data that suggest many work a second job , either religious or secular . The coronavirus-induced economic crisis of 2020 is apt to push that percentage even higher .\nSuch pressures are rekindling a shared ministry model that helped build America \u2019 s church landscape . Anglicans routinely shared clergy in Colonial days because trained priests were too scarce for every church to have its own , according to E. Brooks Holifield , author of \u201c God \u2019 s Ambassadors : A History of the Christian Clergy in America. \u201d One church might sponsor as many as nine chapels that a priest would visit occasionally to administer sacraments . As the frontier was settled , Methodists assigned preachers to circuits , or a string of churches that the horse-riding clerics would check on and feed with word and sacrament every few weeks .\nThe shared pastor model \u201c goes back a long way , but it \u2019 s coming back , \u201d says Mr. Holifield , a historian of American religion .\nWhile population shifts are helping to fuel the trend today , as it did back then , it now comes with a new twist . Mainline congregations are no longer sharing clergy in an ambitious bid to reach a growing country . Burdened with aging church buildings and other costly structures , they \u2019 re trying to scale back to a sustainable footprint , especially in small towns that are losing residents .\n\u201c It looks the same [ as in centuries past ] , but the underlying dynamics are different , \u201d Mr. Holifield says . \u201c In the early 19th century , the issue was rapid geographical expansion . In the 21st century , the issue is more one of contraction \u2013 having to cut back on things so that churches that once were able to afford a full-time pastor often now can not . \u201d\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Andrew Borden , pastor of two different Lutheran churches , eats a potluck supper with parishoners before a Wednesday eve- ning service at one of his venues , Bethel Lutheran Church in Auburn , Massachusetts .\nMoving to shared clergy means a church is reaching beyond its walls for new support , but to what end can vary widely . Depending on the setting , it can be a way to keep church doors open or launch an experimental format . No matter what the circumstances , it challenges pastors and congregants alike to set priorities and accept trade-offs .\nAll of that is on display in America \u2019 s most secular region , New England . From rural corners to urban downtowns , congregations are entering new stages of life with pastors who aren \u2019 t theirs alone . And they \u2019 re finding that means a lot more relationships come to bear on shaping their futures .\nInside a stone church off the main road in Newport , a congregation of 17 gathers for worship on a Saturday at 5 p.m. even though there \u2019 s no fixed furniture to sit on . The pews at Church of the Epiphany were removed , along with assumptions that every church needs a priest all to itself , as part of a relaunch of the congregation in 2017 .\nChancel and pulpit , once reserved for a choir and collared cleric , now go unused . Instead the Rev . Jay MacLeod \u2013 who also serves as rector of St. Andrew \u2019 s Episcopal Church in New London , New Hampshire \u2013 mills among the people , animatedly preaching to them in a partial circle of folding chairs before leading the congregation to the altar for Holy Communion .\nEpiphany hasn \u2019 t always had so many signs of fresh thinking and new life . The church had dwindled to about a dozen people before its part-time priest suddenly retired in 2015 after a family tragedy . The future was uncertain for this cash-strapped congregation in a town struggling with poverty .\n\u201c Epiphany had a choice to make , \u201d says Aaron Jenkyn , who coordinates outreach and pastoral care at Epiphany and St. Andrew \u2019 s . \u201c They had to decide if they were going to shut down , join with another church , or push through and make some big changes to the way that they were doing church . And they bravely chose to make big changes . \u201d\nTeaming up to share a priest with St. Andrew \u2019 s , a larger and more affluent parish , has been as significant as moving worship to Saturdays , renovating interior space , and launching two after-school enrichment programs . One reason : Congregations that share a priest qualify for grants that they otherwise couldn \u2019 t get , according to Tina Pickering , canon for ministry development in the Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire . With grant support , Epiphany is able to provide free music lessons and 4-H programming for neighborhood young people from low-income homes .\nThe church feels it \u2019 s getting a bargain . For $ 9,000 a year , it gets Mr. MacLeod sometimes after school for the music program , for pastoral support in times of crisis , and every Saturday for Mass . In winter , he officiates in ski pants because he \u2019 s just been atop Mount Sunapee serving Holy Communion to skiers . Nobody seems to mind the informality .\n\u201c We want to see this parish survive , \u201d says Epiphany member Gene Jannenga . \u201c The only way we \u2019 re going to be able to do it is to do what \u2019 s happening in other parts of this region \u201d by forging partnerships , including priest-sharing .\nThe arrangement seems to be working . Average weekend attendance has doubled since 2015 , to 24 . Once a month for worship , the congregation offers Messy Church , a popular casual , intergenerational format that drew 65 to Epiphany one Saturday in February .\nFor Mr. MacLeod \u2019 s part , hustling between churches can contribute to feeling emotionally and physically fatigued , he says . But working with young people in Newport is a highlight of his week . The ambitious schedule also fits his personality : A Rhodes scholar with three degrees , he enjoys being challenged .\nWhat makes the partnership tough at times is the long-standing class divide between St. Andrew \u2019 s and Epiphany .\n\u201c Prone to an inward-looking , country club ethos , St. Andrew \u2019 s needed to develop a stronger sense of its own vocation , \u201d Mr. MacLeod says in an email . \u201c St . Andrew \u2019 s supports ministries in Haiti , Honduras , the Middle East , and Navajoland as well as disadvantaged Boston youngsters , but supporting our neighboring parish in Newport has probably raised more eyebrows . I suspect most people are coming around . \u201d\nSharing a priest has helped bridge that gap , churchgoers say , because Mr. MacLeod \u2019 s two flocks rub elbows in ministry trenches . Dozens from St. Andrew \u2019 s volunteer at Epiphany \u2019 s programs for children , and they \u2019 re bringing insight back to New London . In January , for example , St. Andrew \u2019 s began hosting its own Messy Church once a month .\n\u201c At first it was very awkward \u201d to volunteer alongside folks from St. Andrew \u2019 s , says Linda Radford , an Epiphany member since 1965 and a Newport resident . \u201c I \u2019 ve always felt like New London was a little above us , and they might look down on us a little bit . I think that was difficult at first , but now I don \u2019 t feel that . \u201d\nKate Valleli has always belonged to a Lutheran church and wants the same for her three children . When she was growing up , her military family would find the flock in every community in which they lived . It kept them connected to their German Lutheran roots , to new friends , and to God .\nWhat makes the family tradition sustainable in central Massachusetts , where the Vallelis now live , is a pastor-sharing arrangement between two congregations that couldn \u2019 t afford a full-time clergyperson on their own .\nBecause Zion Lutheran in Worcester and Bethel Lutheran in Auburn have teamed up , the family takes part in youth programming at Bethel and urban outreach at Zion . The unifying factor is their pastor , Andrew Borden , who serves both churches under the auspices of Grace Ministries , a framework in which Zion and Bethel act as yoked congregations employing him together .\n\u201c If it were just this campus , there would be fewer and fewer outreach programs happening because of the demographics , \u201d with Zion \u2019 s aging makeup , Ms. Valleli says , as she serves shepherd \u2019 s pie at Zion \u2019 s neighborhood meals program for older people in Worcester . \u201c Pastor is trying to bridge that by bringing more able people from the other congregation to bring things alive here . \u201d\nStories like the Vallelis \u2019 affirm that the two churches offer more together than apart . It helps them survive the costs of maintaining multiple properties .\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Pastor Borden leads congregants during a Wednesday evening service at Bethel Lutheran Church .\nMr. Borden tries to be present wherever he \u2019 s needed and spreads himself thin at times . When he leads midweek worship in Lent , he scrambles from the altar over to play the piano . He oversees at least four buildings as reflected in the jangling key ring on his belt loop . When a tenant lease needs renegotiating , he gets involved . And when services are closely scheduled , he arranges for a lay leader to start things off so that he can arrive partway through the service , don vestments , and step in .\n\u201c I look at it as being one big parish with two geographical locations , \u201d Mr. Borden says . \u201c At one rehab facility , I might be visiting a person from one campus at 10 o \u2019 clock and see someone from the other campus there at 11 o \u2019 clock . For me , I don \u2019 t have to worry about \u2018 am I giving time here or am I giving time there \u2019 because it \u2019 s all a blend . I just go and do . \u201d\nThe pastor-sharing comes at a price , however , for people like Bill Toombs , a retired garbage collector . He used to attend Lenten suppers weekly at Zion , his neighborhood church . Those seasonal sessions still happen , but every other week they \u2019 re now at Bethel . That means he has to load his octogenarian mother-in-law and her wheelchair into a van for the 9-mile ride to Auburn if they want to take part .\nTime with the pastor can be hard to get , too , Mr. Toombs says . He likes to talk with Mr. Borden about common interests or changes in family life , but seldom gets a chance .\n\u201c He gets done here at quarter to 10 and he has to be down there at 10 o \u2019 clock , \u201d Mr. Toombs says at a lunch for neighborhood seniors at Zion . \u201c Sometimes you have something like a death in the family and want to talk to him , but he \u2019 s running out the door to the next church . \u201d\nMr. Borden has been trying to make the arrangement work since 2015 when Zion , where he \u2019 s been since 2007 , could no longer afford to pay him full time . Zion pays more of his salary than Bethel does , but Bethel has the larger and younger congregation . So which one gets him at prime hours on major holiday events like Christmas Eve ?\n\u201c There \u2019 s a really strong preference for \u2018 well , we need the early service [ at Zion ] because we have 30 people for dinner and it starts at 6 o \u2019 clock , \u2019 \u201d Ms. Valleli says . \u201c People are just rigid about \u2013 you can \u2019 t change that . But if we have a bigger congregation over there [ at Bethel ] and a bigger turnout , that \u2019 s where he \u2019 s going to be . \u201d\nSharing a pastor can mean revitalizing a congregation or helping one wind down . In Weld and Phillips , Ms. Tierney is doing both at the same time . Like many rural flocks , the Congregational church in tiny Weld ( pop . 419 ) has struggled at times to survive financially .\nA few years ago , parishioners were worshipping in the parsonage all winter so they wouldn \u2019 t have to heat the main church building . But having a shared pastor arrangement has helped free up funds , including for building expenses . The congregation now holds services in its classic white-steepled church building even on chilly winter days , with fleece blankets offered on pews for extra warmth .\nSwitching back to the traditional venue has helped attract relatively new members such as Tom Skolfield , who felt the church should meet in its meetinghouse . And having a pastor who specializes in tending to small congregations has been a bonus .\n\u201c She has the ability to make both churches feel like they are No . 1 , \u201d says church member Mike Pratt .\nAverage Sunday attendance at the Weld church has climbed from six in 2015 to about 25 now in cold weather months . In summer , attendance swells to between 30 and 50 on a typical Sunday . With a picturesque lake on one side and a popular state park on the other , Weld has benefited from its growing popularity with vacationers . They also tend to give generously .\nPhillips Congregational Church had hoped Ms. Tierney \u2019 s presence could bear new fruit , much as it has in Weld , but sharing a pastor \u2013 even a small-church specialist \u2013 didn \u2019 t lead to similar results .\n\u201c She came here to help us as a small church , but nothing seemed to make any difference here in this community , \u201d says Mary Dunham , a longtime church member . \u201c It didn \u2019 t increase our congregation at all . \u201d\nDespite having the same pastor , the churches are moving in opposite directions . That \u2019 s partly because they \u2019 re barely connected . They happen to contract with the same clergyperson but don \u2019 t coordinate compensation or expectations . As Congregationalists in the UCC , they rely more on local governance than do Lutherans or Episcopalians .\nAnother reason is location . Weld is more stable economically than Phillips , which has battled decline for decades . The Phillips church \u2019 s history of sharing pastors with other congregations dates to the 1970s , when the community was losing manufacturers . Despite sharing pastors with churches of the UCC and the United Methodist Church through the years , nothing has reversed the fortunes of Phillips Congregational Church or the town .\nAnn Hermes/Staff The Rev . Susan Tierney ( left ) shows her spring sash to members of the Phillips Congregational Church , a small congregation in Phillips , Maine , that has been struggling to attract followers .\n\u201c When I was a kid growing up , Phillips had everything you could ever think of \u2013 it was a booming community , \u201d says Paul Gardiner , the son of two workers at Phillips \u2019 long-closed Diamond Match factory . \u201c We had a hardware store , movie theater , doctors , dentists , lawyers , and all that stuff . They \u2019 ve all gone . \u201d\nAfter a career that \u2019 s included stints as a police officer , deputy sheriff , and fire chief in town , Mr. Gardiner now owns a lawn-care business and longs for a renewal of traditional values . \u201c Bunch of young kids don \u2019 t care about doing anything that the older people do , \u201d he says . \u201c How many young people bring their kids to church anymore ? \u201d\nIn March , Phillips Congregational entered yet another new phase . The church ended Ms. Tierney \u2019 s weekly sermons . Instead she will now visit once a month . During the pastor \u2019 s last time behind the pulpit on her regular schedule , two of the three members of the choir wept as they sang \u201c Keep Me Safe as the Storm Passes By . \u201d\n\u201c I feel like we didn \u2019 t do enough to inspire people to be here , \u201d says Ms. Dunham . \u201c I mean , God is the center of my life . I can \u2019 t go a day without Him . I get up early just so I can read and start my day with Him . I just wish other people could feel what that does for them . \u201d\nThe pastor , in her own way , offered reassurance to Ms. Dunham and her fellow parishioners in her sermon . \u201c Do not use this time to struggle to figure out our situation or try to understand what comes next , \u201d Ms. Tierney said . \u201c What I ask of you in this season of Lent is just to rest in hope and take in nourishment from God \u2019 s always-devoted love . \u201d\nAs churches increasingly share pastors , they \u2019 re entering what promises to be an extended transition \u2013 one that can be challenging for both clergy and congregants .\n\u201c The grief is over the loss of what once was and isn \u2019 t coming back , and [ the ] loss of identity , \u201d says Richard Simpson , canon to the ordinary in the Episcopal Diocese of Western Massachusetts . \u201c What makes this work [ of clergy-sharing ] hard is that the clergy themselves are going through it alongside the congregations they serve . \u201d\nWhat emerges from these partnerships runs the gamut from the daunting to the invigorating to the experimental . Sharing clergy brings new partners into the life of a congregation , not only a pastor but also congregants of a sister church . This means more experiences , new sensibilities , and transformed church cultures \u2013 all of which factor into decision-making .

Anglicans routinely shared clergy in Colonial days because trained priests were too scarce for every church to have its own, according to E.

Mainline congregations are no longer sharing clergy in an ambitious bid to reach a growing country.

The pews at Church of the Epiphany were removed, along with assumptions that every church needs a priest all to itself, as part of a relaunch of the congregation in 2017.\n\nChancel and pulpit, once reserved for a choir and collared cleric, now go unused.

The church had dwindled to about a dozen people before its part-time priest suddenly retired in 2015 after a family tragedy. The future was uncertain for this cash-strapped congregation in a town struggling with poverty.\n\n\u201cEpiphany had a choice to make,\u201d says Aaron Jenkyn, who coordinates outreach and pastoral care at Epiphany and St. Andrew\u2019s. \u201cThey had to decide if they were going to shut down, join with another church, or push through and make some big changes to the way that they were doing church. And they bravely chose to make big changes.\u201d\n\nTeaming up to share a priest with St. Andrew\u2019s, a larger and more affluent parish, has been as significant as moving worship to Saturdays, renovating interior space, and launching two after-school enrichment programs. One reason: Congregations that share a priest qualify for grants that they otherwise couldn\u2019t get, according to Tina Pickering, canon for ministry development in the Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire. With grant support, Epiphany is able to provide free music lessons and 4-H programming for neighborhood young people from low-income homes.\n\nThe church feels it\u2019s getting a bargain. For $9,000 a year, it gets Mr. MacLeod sometimes after school for the music program, for pastoral support in times of crisis, and every Saturday for Mass. In winter, he officiates in ski pants because he\u2019s just been atop Mount Sunapee serving Holy Communion to skiers. Nobody seems to mind the informality.\n\n\u201cWe want to see this parish survive,\u201d says Epiphany member Gene Jannenga. \u201cThe only way we\u2019re going to be able to do it is to do what\u2019s happening in other parts of this region\u201d by forging partnerships, including priest-sharing.\n\nThe arrangement seems to be working. Average weekend attendance has doubled since 2015, to 24. Once a month for worship, the congregation offers Messy Church, a popular casual, intergenerational format that drew 65 to Epiphany one Saturday in February.\n\nFor Mr. MacLeod\u2019s part, hustling between churches can contribute to feeling emotionally and physically fatigued, he says. But working with young people in Newport is a highlight of his week. The ambitious schedule also fits his personality: A Rhodes scholar with three degrees, he enjoys being challenged.\n\nWhat makes the partnership tough at times is the long-standing class divide between St. Andrew\u2019s and Epiphany.\n\n\u201cProne to an inward-looking, country club ethos, St. Andrew\u2019s needed to develop a stronger sense of its own vocation,\u201d Mr. MacLeod says in an email. \u201cSt. Andrew\u2019s supports ministries in Haiti, Honduras, the Middle East, and Navajoland as well as disadvantaged Boston youngsters, but supporting our neighboring parish in Newport has probably raised more eyebrows. I suspect most people are coming around.\u201d\n\nSharing a priest has helped bridge that gap, churchgoers say, because Mr. MacLeod\u2019s two flocks rub elbows in ministry trenches. Dozens from St. Andrew\u2019s volunteer at Epiphany\u2019s programs for children, and they\u2019re bringing insight back to New London. In January, for example, St. Andrew\u2019s began hosting its own Messy Church once a month.\n\n\u201cAt first it was very awkward\u201d to volunteer alongside folks from St. Andrew\u2019s, says Linda Radford, an Epiphany member since 1965 and a Newport resident. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt like New London was a little above us, and they might look down on us a little bit. I think that was difficult at first, but now I don\u2019t feel that.\u201d\n\n\u2018One big parish\u2019\n\nKate Valleli has always belonged to a Lutheran church and wants the same for her three children. When she was growing up, her military family would find the flock in every community in which they lived. It kept them connected to their German Lutheran roots, to new friends, and to God.\n\nWhat makes the family tradition sustainable in central Massachusetts, where the Vallelis now live, is a pastor-sharing arrangement between two congregations that couldn\u2019t afford a full-time clergyperson on their own.\n\nBecause Zion Lutheran in Worcester and Bethel Lutheran in Auburn have teamed up, the family takes part in youth programming at Bethel and urban outreach at Zion. The unifying factor is their pastor, Andrew Borden, who serves both churches under the auspices of Grace Ministries, a framework in which Zion and Bethel act as yoked congregations employing him together.\n\n\u201cIf it were just this campus, there would be fewer and fewer outreach programs happening because of the demographics,\u201d with Zion\u2019s aging makeup, Ms. Valleli says, as she serves shepherd\u2019s pie at Zion\u2019s neighborhood meals program for older people in Worcester. \u201cPastor is trying to bridge that by bringing more able people from the other congregation to bring things alive here.\u201d\n\nStories like the Vallelis\u2019 affirm that the two churches offer more together than apart. It helps them survive the costs of maintaining multiple properties.\n\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Pastor Borden leads congregants during a Wednesday evening service at Bethel Lutheran Church.\n\nMr. Borden tries to be present wherever he\u2019s needed and spreads himself thin at times. When he leads midweek worship in Lent, he scrambles from the altar over to play the piano. He oversees at least four buildings as reflected in the jangling key ring on his belt loop. When a tenant lease needs renegotiating, he gets involved. And when services are closely scheduled, he arranges for a lay leader to start things off so that he can arrive partway through the service, don vestments, and step in.\n\n\u201cI look at it as being one big parish with two geographical locations,\u201d Mr. Borden says. \u201cAt one rehab facility, I might be visiting a person from one campus at 10 o\u2019clock and see someone from the other campus there at 11 o\u2019clock. For me, I don\u2019t have to worry about \u2018am I giving time here or am I giving time there\u2019 because it\u2019s all a blend. I just go and do.\u201d\n\nThe pastor-sharing comes at a price, however, for people like Bill Toombs, a retired garbage collector. He used to attend Lenten suppers weekly at Zion, his neighborhood church. Those seasonal sessions still happen, but every other week they\u2019re now at Bethel. That means he has to load his octogenarian mother-in-law and her wheelchair into a van for the 9-mile ride to Auburn if they want to take part.\n\nTime with the pastor can be hard to get, too, Mr. Toombs says. He likes to talk with Mr. Borden about common interests or changes in family life, but seldom gets a chance.\n\n\u201cHe gets done here at quarter to 10 and he has to be down there at 10 o\u2019clock,\u201d Mr. Toombs says at a lunch for neighborhood seniors at Zion. \u201cSometimes you have something like a death in the family and want to talk to him, but he\u2019s running out the door to the next church.\u201d\n\nMr. Borden has been trying to make the arrangement work since 2015 when Zion, where he\u2019s been since 2007, could no longer afford to pay him full time. Zion pays more of his salary than Bethel does, but Bethel has the larger and younger congregation. So which one gets him at prime hours on major holiday events like Christmas Eve?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a really strong preference for \u2018well, we need the early service [at Zion] because we have 30 people for dinner and it starts at 6 o\u2019clock,\u2019\u201d Ms. Valleli says. \u201cPeople are just rigid about \u2013 you can\u2019t change that. But if we have a bigger congregation over there [at Bethel] and a bigger turnout, that\u2019s where he\u2019s going to be.\u201d\n\nSharing a pastor can mean revitalizing a congregation or helping one wind down. In Weld and Phillips, Ms. Tierney is doing both at the same time. Like many rural flocks, the Congregational church in tiny Weld (pop. 419) has struggled at times to survive financially.\n\nA few years ago, parishioners were worshipping in the parsonage all winter so they wouldn\u2019t have to heat the main church building. But having a shared pastor arrangement has helped free up funds, including for building expenses. The congregation now holds services in its classic white-steepled church building even on chilly winter days, with fleece blankets offered on pews for extra warmth.\n\nSwitching back to the traditional venue has helped attract relatively new members such as Tom Skolfield, who felt the church should meet in its meetinghouse. And having a pastor who specializes in tending to small congregations has been a bonus.\n\n\u201cShe has the ability to make both churches feel like they are No. 1,\u201d says church member Mike Pratt.\n\nAverage Sunday attendance at the Weld church has climbed from six in 2015 to about 25 now in cold weather months. In summer, attendance swells to between 30 and 50 on a typical Sunday. With a picturesque lake on one side and a popular state park on the other, Weld has benefited from its growing popularity with vacationers. They also tend to give generously.\n\nPhillips Congregational Church had hoped Ms. Tierney\u2019s presence could bear new fruit, much as it has in Weld, but sharing a pastor \u2013 even a small-church specialist \u2013 didn\u2019t lead to similar results.\n\n\u201cShe came here to help us as a small church, but nothing seemed to make any difference here in this community,\u201d says Mary Dunham, a longtime church member. \u201cIt didn\u2019t increase our congregation at all.\u201d\n\nDespite having the same pastor, the churches are moving in opposite directions. That\u2019s partly because they\u2019re barely connected. They happen to contract with the same clergyperson but don\u2019t coordinate compensation or expectations. As Congregationalists in the UCC, they rely more on local governance than do Lutherans or Episcopalians.\n\nAnother reason is location. Weld is more stable economically than Phillips, which has battled decline for decades. The Phillips church\u2019s history of sharing pastors with other congregations dates to the 1970s, when the community was losing manufacturers. Despite sharing pastors with churches of the UCC and the United Methodist Church through the years, nothing has reversed the fortunes of Phillips Congregational Church or the town.\n\nAnn Hermes/Staff The Rev. Susan Tierney (left) shows her spring sash to members of the Phillips Congregational Church, a small congregation in Phillips, Maine, that has been struggling to attract followers.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a kid growing up, Phillips had everything you could ever think of \u2013 it was a booming community,\u201d says Paul Gardiner, the son of two workers at Phillips\u2019 long-closed Diamond Match factory. \u201cWe had a hardware store, movie theater, doctors, dentists, lawyers, and all that stuff. They\u2019ve all gone.\u201d\n\nAfter a career that\u2019s included stints as a police officer, deputy sheriff, and fire chief in town, Mr. Gardiner now owns a lawn-care business and longs for a renewal of traditional values. \u201cBunch of young kids don\u2019t care about doing anything that the older people do,\u201d he says. \u201cHow many young people bring their kids to church anymore?\u201d\n\nIn March, Phillips Congregational entered yet another new phase. The church ended Ms. Tierney\u2019s weekly sermons. Instead she will now visit once a month. During the pastor\u2019s last time behind the pulpit on her regular schedule, two of the three members of the choir wept as they sang \u201cKeep Me Safe as the Storm Passes By.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like we didn\u2019t do enough to inspire people to be here,\u201d says Ms. Dunham. \u201cI mean, God is the center of my life. I can\u2019t go a day without Him. I get up early just so I can read and start my day with Him. I just wish other people could feel what that does for them.\u201d\n\nThe pastor, in her own way, offered reassurance to Ms. Dunham and her fellow parishioners in her sermon. \u201cDo not use this time to struggle to figure out our situation or try to understand what comes next,\u201d Ms. Tierney said. \u201cWhat I ask of you in this season of Lent is just to rest in hope and take in nourishment from God\u2019s always-devoted love.\u201d\n\nA culture transformed\n\nAs churches increasingly share pastors, they\u2019re entering what promises to be an extended transition \u2013 one that can be challenging for both clergy and congregants.\n\n\u201cThe grief is over the loss of what once was and isn\u2019t coming back, and [the] loss of identity,\u201d says Richard Simpson, canon to the ordinary in the Episcopal Diocese of Western Massachusetts. \u201cWhat makes this work [of clergy-sharing] hard is that the clergy themselves are going through it alongside the congregations they serve.\u201d\n\nWhat emerges from these partnerships runs the gamut from the daunting to the invigorating to the experimental. Sharing clergy brings new partners into the life of a congregation, not only a pastor but also congregants of a sister church. This means more experiences, new sensibilities, and transformed church cultures \u2013 all of which factor into decision-making. And with more influences come more ideas and possibilities.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.
