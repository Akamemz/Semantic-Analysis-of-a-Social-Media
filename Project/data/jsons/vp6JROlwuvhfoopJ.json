    "content": "In a major blow to state-by-state progressive efforts to effectively replace the Electoral College with a nationwide popular vote , a federal appeals court ruled on Tuesday that presidential electors in the Electoral College have the absolute right to vote for presidential candidates of their choice .\nDemocrats have increasingly sought to erase the Electoral College 's influence by promoting state laws that would force electors to vote for the national popular vote leader -- and those laws were now in jeopardy as a result of the court 's ruling , legal experts said .\nThe decision , however , also raised the prospect that electors could legally defect at the last minute , and decide the occupant of the White House on their own in dramatic fashion , weeks after Election Day .\nThe 10th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals held that the Colorado secretary of state violated the Constitution in 2016 when he removed an elector and nullified his vote because the elector refused to cast his ballot for Democrat Hillary Clinton , who received a plurality of the popular vote both nationally and in Colorado .\nThe rogue elector was part of an unsuccessful scheme to convince enough members of the Electoral College to unite behind an alternative candidate and deny Donald Trump the presidency .\nThe split decision by a three-judge panel on the Denver appeals court asserted : `` Article II and the Twelfth Amendment provide presidential electors the right to cast a vote for President and Vice President with discretion . And the state does not possess countervailing authority to remove an elector and to cancel his vote in response to the exercise of that Constitutional right . ''\nThe panel continued , `` The electoral college did not exist before ratification of the federal Constitution , and thus the states could reserve no rights related to it under the Tenth Amendment . Rather , the states possess only the rights expressly delegated to them in Article II and the Twelfth Amendment . ''\nThe appeals court reasoned that once electors show up at the Electoral College , they essentially become federal actors performing a `` federal function , '' independent of state control .\nProminent Democrats , including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York , have slammed the Electoral College in recent weeks , calling it a racist `` scam . ''\nAOC UNDER FIRE FOR CALLING ELECTORAL COLLEGE A RACIST 'SCAM '\n`` The Electoral College has a racial injustice breakdown , '' Ocasio-Cortez said on Instagram Monday . `` Due to severe racial disparities in certain states , the Electoral College effectively weighs white voters over voters of color , as opposed to a 'one person , one vote ' system where all our votes are counted equally . ''\nOrganized efforts to undermine the Electoral College have picked up steam this year . The so-called National Popular Vote interstate compact , which would commit states ' electors to the winner of the national vote , has been adopted by 16 jurisdictions , accounting for 196 electoral votes , including 15 states and the District of Columbia .\nHowever , the compact , by its terms , will only take effect if jurisdictions accounting for at least 270 of the 538 total votes available in the Electoral College also sign on .\nMore than two dozen states also have laws binding electors to the results of the popular vote in those states . But the actual penalties for so-called `` faithless electors '' are minimal and in many cases non-existent .\nThe Tuesday ruling could spell doom for a new Colorado law that effectively signed the state onto the national compact , by prohibiting states from forcing their electors to vote for either the national or state popular vote winner or leader . Other states that have signed onto the compact include Rhode Island , Vermont , Hawaii , Delaware , Maryland , Massachusetts , New Mexico , Washington , Connecticut , New Jersey , Illinois , California , and New York .\nAt the same time , Frank McNulty , an adviser to Protect Colorado 's Vote , which wants voters to overturn the law , cautioned that the ruling could also free electors to decide on their own to support the candidate with the most votes nationally -- or any candidate , for that matter .\nThe Electoral College system is established in the Constitution . When voters cast a ballot for president , they are actually choosing members of the Electoral College , called electors , who are pledged to that presidential candidate . The electors then choose the president . Electors are selected by state parties at nominating conventions , and generally consist of party leaders , activists , and other luminaries .\n`` It is a double-edge decision .
