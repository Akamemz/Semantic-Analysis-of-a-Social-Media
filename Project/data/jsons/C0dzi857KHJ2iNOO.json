Which is why no one was remotely surprised when , within the space of a few hours , Google announced that it had all been an enormous misunderstanding , that The Federalist would be given three days to clean up its act , that the recent sanctions , only threatened rather than imposed , had nothing to do with the content of any actual article that had appeared on the site but rather with the fact that it maintained an open comments platform . Meanwhile , NBC also claimed that , despite its own reporters \u2019 gleeful cheerleading on behalf of their \u201c collaboration \u201d with foreign research outfits , there had been no such collaboration at all , that Google had misrepresented its own actions to them , that contrary to previous reports ( its own ) , Google would not ban a website for something it had been accused of doing in material brought to Google \u2019 s attention by , well , NBC .
