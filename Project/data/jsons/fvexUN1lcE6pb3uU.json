    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) The telephone lines of Washington 's premiere hotels have been ringing since Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross announced plans to host high-level trade negotiations with his Chinese counterparts before the end of the month .\nDetails of the high-stakes trade talks between the world 's two economic superpowers are so thin that Washington trade advocacy groups have resorted to calling around town to ask whether blocs of rooms have been reserved for the Chinese delegation , which may include Chinese Vice Premier Liu He .\nSuch time-consuming efforts to glean any information on an expected third round of bilateral talks underscores the widespread uncertainty surrounding efforts to lay the groundwork for a trade deal between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping during their expected meeting at the G20 summit in Argentina at the end of November .\nWith a January 1 deadline to ratchet up US tariffs to 25 % on more than $ 200 billion in Chinese imports approaching , players in Washington are increasingly desperate for any sign of de-escalation , according to interviews with more than a half a dozen business executives , Wall Street analysts , lobbyists and industry groups , including some with close ties to the Trump administration .\n`` As any administration doubles down , particularly before a meeting like this , and when there are important issues at stake , everyone in town is trying to find out as much as they can , '' said Wendy Cutler , a managing director for the Asia Society and a former diplomat and negotiator for the Office of the US Trade Representative under President Barack Obama . `` What happened on that phone call ? Where 's the paper ? Do you have the paper ? If you ca n't give me the paper , what 's in the paper ? And if you ca n't tell me , can you tell me if this is in or out ? ''\nOn Friday , the American President offered a hint over how back-channel communications between the two economic superpowers are progressing , confirming reports that the Chinese had sent a preliminary offer -- which so far remains tightly held .\nTrump described it as a `` very complete list `` of 142 concessions on a variety of issues Washington has put to Beijing .\n`` It 's a lot of the things we 've asked , '' Trump told reporters in the Oval Office . `` But there are four or five things left off . ''\nTrump also revived his threat of imposing a third round of tariffs on $ 267 billion of goods , if necessary , but suggested he probably would n't need to take such a step , because `` China would like to make a deal . ''\nXi offered a reply in remarks at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in Papua New Guinea on Saturday , where he spoke of the need for global cooperation and international trade and said there was no issue that countries could n't work out `` through consultation . ''\n`` History has shown that confrontation , whether in the form of a cold war , a hot war or a trade war , will produce no winners , '' Xi said to applause .\nBut US Vice President Mike Pence , speaking after the Chinese leader , said while they had `` great respect for President Xi '' and China , there would be no backing down on the trade war with Beijing until it `` changes its ways . ''\n`` China has taken advantage of the United States for many , many years and those days are over , '' Pence said .\nThe upcoming Argentina meeting is the only scheduled opportunity for a direct t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate between Trump and Xi , though the two leaders exchanged direct visits in 2017 -- with Trump welcoming Xi at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida with a lavish banquet and a singing performance in Mandarin by his granddaughter Arabella .\nBut whatever is announced in Buenos Aires will invert the usual progress of trade negotiations , where leaders meet to formalize agreements already hashed out among lower-level aides . In the end , it 's likely to amount to a pledge by both presidents to end a tense year of damaging tit-for-tat tariffs between the world 's two largest trading partners .\n`` Any reduction in trade tensions would be welcomed , but we see it as a short-term truce , '' Michael Gapen , chief US economist at Barclays Investment Bank wrote in a note to clients .\nCasting a long shadow over the on-and-off negotiations between the two countries has been a shortage of trust by Chinese negotiators , who have wrestled with conflicting signals from the Trump administration on its trade policy and who to work with , and grappling with the reality that any deal with Trump is n't real until the President says it himself .\n`` They are more than a little gun-shy , '' said Craig Allen , president of the US-China Business Council , pointing to two previous failed attempts to broker a trade truce between the two countries .\nChina 's Liu met Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross twice earlier this year , including last May , when Beijing 's delegation left the room with the belief the two sides had reached a tentative pact , only to have Trump veto the deal .\n`` The Chinese thought they had an agreement with a Cabinet member , who was empowered and had authority from the President , '' said Allen . `` They found out , 'No , they did n't . ' ''\nThe Trump administration has been divided between free traders -- including those with Wall Street backgrounds like Mnuchin and White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow -- and hardliners like US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro , a former academic who has publicly broken with his colleagues on the China issue .\nNavarro last week gave a speech at a Washington think tank in which he warned that `` Wall Street '' was trying to meddle with Trump 's China crackdown . That prompted a retort from Kudlow , who in remarks to reporters on the White House driveway called Navarro 's comments `` unauthorized . ''\nFor those who closely follow the political theater within the White House , Navarro 's comments and Kudlow 's quick rebuttal were an indication that a deal might actually be in the offing , especially after a phone call last week between Liu and Mnuchin\nBut the President on Friday revived the threat of a third tranche of tariffs , which would effectively impose a penalty on nearly every item that American consumers buy , raising the stakes even higher of brokering a cease-fire . That does n't even account for any retaliatory action Beijing could unilaterally take against the US .\nA trade war would likely result in a faster rise in inflation and force the Federal Reserve to hike rates even more quickly to stamp out any signs of overheating .\n`` We have to take him seriously , '' said Allen . `` But if you do take him seriously , and I think it 's imperative that we do so , then the implications of that on US inflation are significant , particularly at the consumer price level . It would force Jay Powell to increase interest rates faster and higher . ''\nMore than 100 S & P companies have already pre-emptively telegraphed during the third quarter earnings calls the damage further tariffs would impose on the US economy . Some companies like Walmart , the country 's biggest retailer , have warned that prices on everyday goods like shampoo , detergents and paper goods like napkins will get more expensive for consumers .\nOn a recent call , Black and Decker Chief Executive James Lorree cautioned investors , `` I want to make it very clear that it 's not a doom-and-gloom story right now , and we do n't expect it to be in the fourth quarter , because the bulk of the tariff increases really do n't hit until January 1 . ''\nWhile so far much of the attention on the undo harm of the existing tariffs has fallen on China , political scientists and economists also warn there could be deeper ramifications for American corporations , if the Chinese opt to restrict American investment .
