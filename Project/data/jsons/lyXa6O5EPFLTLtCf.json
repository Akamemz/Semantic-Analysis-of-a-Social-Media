    "content": "How a drug became an object lesson in political tribalism .\nOn January 29 the Hubei Daily , a state-owned Chinese newspaper based in Wuhan , reported on a promising development . Teams of researchers associated with the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences and the Wuhan Institute of Virology had tested dozens of existing pharmaceuticals for possible efficacy against the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 . They had identified three antiviral drugs that seemed to inhibit the virus from reproducing or infecting other cells in a test tube .\nThe question of whether hydroxychloroquine is a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19 became a locus for political tribalism and polarization .\nWithin a week the highly regarded journal Cell Research published a peer-reviewed letter by researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology that reported on two of these in more detail : chloroquine , developed in the 1930s to treat malaria , and remdesivir , a newer drug developed for Ebola . Within days Chinese researchers announced new clinical studies to test these drugs in patients , along with another antimalarial drug , hydroxychloroquine , which is derived from chloroquine and is generally considered safer . The science has continued apace , and results of most of the clinical studies are still pending .\nIn the meantime , something strange happened . It started with a series of tweets . On March 11 an Australian entrepreneur living in China tweeted at a Bitcoin investor that chloroquine would \u201c keep most people out of hospital. \u201d That investor then co-authored and shared a document making the case for chloroquine . On March 16 Elon Musk began tweeting about chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine and shared that document . Two days later Tucker Carlson did a segment on Fox News discussing these drugs with one of the document \u2019 s co-authors . That same day , March 19 , President Trump gave a press conference in which he announced that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine had shown \u201c very , very encouraging \u201d early results . Since then , Trump has repeatedly touted hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 miracle drug .\nOver the following weeks , the question of whether hydroxychloroquine is a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19 became a locus for political tribalism and polarization . Trump supporters on social media share evidence , often anecdotal or clinical , that hydroxychloroquine is effective ; Trump \u2019 s critics share evidence that it is not and argue there are significant costs to promoting an unproven drug . Even traditional media has weighed in . The right-leaning Wall Street Journal published an opinion piece by doctors supporting the use of the drug ; the left-leaning Washington Post emphasized that there are warnings from medical experts about \u201c dangerous consequences \u201d of using it to treat COVID-19 .\nOf course , polarization is hardly a new phenomenon in the United States . Growing polarization over political values has bled into polarized beliefs about matters of fact , from the relative sizes of Trump and Obama \u2019 s inauguration crowds to what the U.S. unemployment rate actually is . And issues of both established and ongoing scientific research are not immune : just consider polarization over global climate change , evolutionary theory , and vaccine safety .\nWith the arrival of COVID-19 , new opportunities for polarization have emerged . Recent surveys have found a stark divide , with Democrats consistently expressing greater concern about the seriousness of COVID-19 , while Republicans are more likely to think it is exaggerated . More Democrats report taking precautions such as avoiding crowds and washing their hands . And these differences seem to extend to specific matters of fact , such as the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine .\nPundits and journalists who treat claims supporting hydroxychloroquine as akin to typical misinformation or even radical conspiracy theories are misdiagnosing the situation .\nYet with all this polarization , there is still something distinctive and puzzling about these disagreements over COVID-19 . Most notable cases of polarization over matters of fact have relatively mild day-to-day consequences . Nobody dies from skepticism about evolution . And while skepticism about global climate change or vaccines may ultimately cause significant harms , long time scales in the first case and herd immunity in the second help to protect non-believers from immediate consequences . Given that COVID-19 can kill within a matter of weeks , and that bad choices can put a person in immediate danger , one might think there would not be much room for tribalism . After all , we do not expect polarization over whether , say , drinking antifreeze\u2014or injecting disinfectants , for that matter\u2014is a good idea .\nWhy are we seeing the polarization over hydroxycholorquine , then , in spite of the serious consequences ? The explanation may lie in the kind of information available to the public about COVID-19 , which differs importantly from what we see in other cases of polarization about science . When it comes to the health effects of injecting disinfectants , there is no uncertainty about the massive risks . And for that reason , we don \u2019 t expect polarization to emerge , even if Trump suggests trying it . But even the best information about COVID-19 is in a state of constant flux . Scientists are publishing new articles every day , while old articles and claims are retracted or refuted . Norms of scientific publication , which usually dictate slower timeframes and more thorough peer review , have been relaxed by scientific communities desperately seeking solutions . And with readers clamoring for the latest virus news , journalists are on the hunt for new articles they can report on , sometimes pushing claims into prime time before they \u2019 ve been properly vetted .\nAll this means that there is a huge amount of information circulating that has some scientific legitimacy but that may be dramatically underdeveloped and more likely than normal scientific findings to be overturned . Claims about hydroxychloroquine fall into this category . Despite widely reported but hardly definitive recent studies , which Trump \u2019 s media critics have latched onto as evidence that hydroxychloroquine does not improve outcomes , the scientific jury is still out . We do not yet know whether hydroxychloroquine , remdesivir , or other possible treatments are effective for COVID-19 .\nThis legitimate uncertainty means that pundits and journalists who treat claims supporting hydroxychloroquine as akin to typical misinformation ( or radical conspiracy theories ) are misdiagnosing the situation . Trumpeting hydroxychloroquine is undoubtedly risky , both because current evidence is too mixed to support that claim and because it can lead to problems like drug hoarding . But sharing anecdotal accounts of the success of hydroxychloroquine in various clinical settings is not necessarily misinformation\u2014and neither is sharing information about failed clinical trials or shortages for patients who need the drug for other purposes . These are all pieces of evidence that should inform any reasonable person \u2019 s beliefs about hydroxychloroquine and COVID-19 .\nThis is not to say that nothing has gone badly wrong with the public discourse about the drug . Amidst a sea of uncertainty , people are deciding which way to swim by attending to social factors , rather than scientific ones .\nTelling one isolated truth , rather than the whole truth , can be just as bad as telling a falsehood . This is especially true for issues related to human health , where data is often messy .\nPart of the reason this happens is that facts can mislead when they are shared with incomplete context or without other relevant facts . Telling one isolated truth , rather than the whole truth , can be just as bad as telling a falsehood . This is especially true for issues related to human health , where data is often messy . Some COVID-19 patients who take hydroxychloroquine will recover ; some will die . What is difficult to determine is how many who recover would have recovered anyway , and how many who die after taking the drug would have died anyway . In the absence of high-quality studies , determining the proper context for any fact is exceptionally difficult , and even experts struggle to do it well .\nThe upshot is perhaps counterintuitive : people can wind up misinformed even in the absence of misinformation . Or maybe it is best to think of misinformation as a function of the whole ecology of information available\u2014how it is framed , who shares it , where it gets circulated , and so on\u2014not simply a matter of isolated claims being true or false , more justified or less .\nIn particular , people become misinformed because they tend to trust those they identify with , meaning they are more likely to listen to those who share their social and political identities . When public figures such as Donald Trump and Rush Limbaugh make claims about hydroxychloroquine , Republicans are more likely to be swayed , while Democrats are not . The two groups then start sharing different sorts of information about hydroxychloroquine , and stop trusting what they see from the other side .\nPeople also like to conform with those in their social networks . It is often psychologically uncomfortable to disagree with our closest friends and family members . But different clusters or cliques can end up conforming to different claims . Some people fit in by rolling their eyes about hydroxychloroquine , while others fit in by praising Trump for supporting it .\nThese social factors can lead to belief factions : groups of people who share a number of polarized beliefs . As philosophers of science , we \u2019 ve used models to argue that when these factions form , there need not be any underlying logic to the beliefs that get lumped together . Beliefs about the safety of gun ownership , for example , can start to correlate with beliefs about whether there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq . When this happens , beliefs can become signals of group membership\u2014even for something as dangerous as an emerging pandemic . One person might show which tribe they belong to by sewing their own face mask . Another by throwing a barbeque , despite stay at home orders .\nAnd yet another might signal group membership by posting a screed about hydroxychloroquine . There is nothing about hydroxychloroquine in particular that makes it a natural talking point for Republicans . It could just as easily have been remdesivir , or one of a half dozen other potential miracle drugs , that was picked up by Fox News , and then by Trump . The process by which Trump settled on hydroxychloroquine was essentially random\u2014and yet , once he began touting it , it became associated with political identity in just the way we have described .
