The story of Donald Trump and Russia comes down to this : a sitting president or his campaign is suspected of having coordinated with a foreign country to manipulate a US election . The story could not be bigger , and the stakes for Trump \u2013 and the country \u2013 could not be higher . What are the key questions ? Investigators are asking two basic questions : did Trump \u2019 s presidential campaign collude at any level with Russian operatives to sway the 2016 US presidential election ? And did Trump or others break the law to throw investigators off the trail ? What does the country think ? While a majority of the American public now believes that Russia tried to disrupt the US election , opinions about Trump campaign involvement tend to split along partisan lines : 73 % of Republicans , but only 13 % of Democrats , believe Trump did \u201c nothing wrong \u201d in his dealings with Russia and its president , Vladimir Putin . What are the implications for Trump ? The affair has the potential to eject Trump from office . Experienced legal observers believe that prosecutors are investigating whether Trump committed an obstruction of justice . Both Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton \u2013 the only presidents to face impeachment proceedings in the last century \u2013 were accused of obstruction of justice . But Trump \u2019 s fate is probably up to the voters . Even if strong evidence of wrongdoing by him or his cohort emerged , a Republican congressional majority would probably block any action to remove him from office . ( Such an action would be a historical rarity . ) What has happened so far ? Former foreign policy adviser George Papadopolous pleaded guilty to perjury over his contacts with Russians linked to the Kremlin , and the president \u2019 s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and another aide face charges of money laundering . When will the inquiry come to an end ? The investigations have an open timeline .\nMeanwhile , in a federal courthouse in central Washington , Trump \u2019 s former campaign manager , Paul Manafort , and a business associate , Rick Gates , pleaded not guilty to an indictment for money laundering , tax evasion , failure to register as agents for foreign interests and conspiracy to defraud the US government .\nA federal judge ordered Manafort and Gates to be confined at home and set bail at $ 10m for Manafort and $ 5m for Gates .\nThe indictments were the first issued by Robert Mueller since he was appointed special counsel in May , with broad powers to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election and possible collusion by members of the Trump campaign .\nAfter the indictment of Manafort and Gates was revealed on Monday morning , Trump tweeted : \u201c Sorry , but this is years ago , before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign . But why aren \u2019 t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus ? ? ? ? ? \u201d\nLater , the White House press secretary , Sarah Huckabee Sanders , played down the connection between the three men and the Trump campaign .

The charges , which Papadopoulos accepted as accurate as part of a guilty plea on 5 October , said Trump was present at a meeting of national security advisers where Papadopoulos boasted of his Russian connections and said he could help organise a meeting with Putin .\nThe charges state that the unnamed woman he was in contact with was not related to the Russian president .
