But the coronavirus pandemic \u2019 s impact on America \u2019 s higher education landscape will likely far outlast the next semester , or even year .\nOne of the most devastating consequences of the public health crisis and the accompanying economic downturn for colleges and their students could be the way in which it exacerbates the inequality already present in the system .
