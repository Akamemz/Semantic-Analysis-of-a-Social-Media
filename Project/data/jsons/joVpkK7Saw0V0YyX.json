    "content": "Democrats were thinking Saturday \u2019 s debate was doomed to be another slow affair . Some expected a straight-up snoozer . But never fear , Bernie Sanders and his lawsuit are here .\nBy effectively declaring war on the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton on Friday , Sanders cranked up the anticipation exponentially , ensuring that the debate stage will be as tense as it \u2019 s ever been on the Democratic side of 2016 while accusations fly about stolen data and Clinton \u2019 s relationship with the Democratic National Committee .\nAs Sanders plans to turn the evening \u2013 and the election \u2013 into a referendum on the party establishment , here \u2019 s what \u2588\u2588\u2588 will be watching for during the forum in New Hampshire :\nSanders will come out swinging . Clinton will punch back , maybe harder . That much is clear .\nThe underdog \u2019 s aides are open about the fact that Sanders sees his brawl \u2014 and lawsuit in federal court \u2014 with the DNC as an opportunity to fire up his loyal backers and to persuade any liberals who are still uncertain about Clinton . The front-runner has the DNC \u2019 s leadership \u2014 including chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz \u2014 in her pocket , Sanders will say , and their relationship endangers the integrity of the party .\nClinton , meanwhile , won \u2019 t shy from the fight : her allies are saying that the data stolen by Sanders staffers was worth millions of dollars , and members of her political team were genuinely shaken by the revelation on Friday . Look for the former secretary of state \u2014 backed by almost the entire Democratic establishment \u2014 to lay into Sanders and what her staff sees as his dishonesty , and his campaign \u2019 s theft . His team went way too far , she will likely say , and now the senator is trying to distract from that .\nIn other words , expect more real anger than we \u2019 ve seen so far on the left of the 2016 contest .\n2 .

But never fear, Bernie Sanders and his lawsuit are here.\n\nBy effectively declaring war on the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton on Friday, Sanders cranked up the anticipation exponentially, ensuring that the debate stage will be as tense as it\u2019s ever been on the Democratic side of 2016 while accusations fly about stolen data and Clinton\u2019s relationship with the Democratic National Committee.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAs Sanders plans to turn the evening \u2013 and the election \u2013 into a referendum on the party establishment, here\u2019s what POLITICO will be watching for during the forum in New Hampshire:\n\n1. Real. Life. Excitement.\n\nSanders will come out swinging. Clinton will punch back, maybe harder. That much is clear.\n\nThe underdog\u2019s aides are open about the fact that Sanders sees his brawl \u2014 and lawsuit in federal court \u2014 with the DNC as an opportunity to fire up his loyal backers and to persuade any liberals who are still uncertain about Clinton. The front-runner has the DNC\u2019s leadership \u2014 including chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz \u2014 in her pocket, Sanders will say, and their relationship endangers the integrity of the party.\n\nClinton, meanwhile, won\u2019t shy from the fight: her allies are saying that the data stolen by Sanders staffers was worth millions of dollars, and members of her political team were genuinely shaken by the revelation on Friday.

Saturday could provide her with a prime opportunity to expose his policy soft spots, figure her allies, since he has spent days with briefing books ahead of previous debates.\n\n3. ISIS ISIS ISIS ISIS. And some other foreign policy stuff.\n\nClinton has turned her foreign-policy experience into an \u2018adult in the room\u2019 strategy through a series of speeches and campaign communications, including a Friday op-ed in the local Union Leader newspaper and a Minneapolis terrorism speech on Wednesday.

Will anyone watch?\n\nDemocrats aligned with Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley have long been angry at the DNC and the networks about the debate schedule, which they say is designed to protect Clinton through low viewership. And this third debate, coming the Saturday night before Christmas, is a prime example, they\u2019ve said.\n\nWhile Sanders\u2019 attempt to ignite a fire under his base on Friday could goose the numbers, most party leaders are still skeptical that the event will move the ball demonstrably unless any one candidate makes a howling error.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one [New Hampshire] debate and that one is happening on probably the biggest shopping weekend of the year,\u201d complained O\u2019Malley\u2019s state director John Bivona. \u201cThe most common phrase we hear from our supporters when we tell them to tune in is, \u2018Why is the debate on a Saturday night?\u2019\"\n\nPlus, people around the candidates are wondering how they\u2019re supposed to respond to the arrows slung at them by Republicans on Wednesday during their own prime-time debate that drew 18 million viewers.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats should have been more skillful.
