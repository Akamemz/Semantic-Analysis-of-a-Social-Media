    "content": "Toward the end of our meeting with President Obama , one of us asked whether the Iran nuclear deal might change the future of that country 's poisonously anti-American politics , and Obama drifted from the technical and political details he 'd otherwise focused on into something of a more reflective tone .\n`` I just don \u2019 t know , '' he said , leaning back a bit in his chair for the first time since he 'd arrived . `` When Nixon went to China , Mao was still in power . He had no idea how that was going to play out .\n`` He didn \u2019 t know that Deng Xiaoping would suddenly come in and decide that it doesn \u2019 t matter what color the cat is as long as it catches mice , and the next thing you know you \u2019 ve got this state capitalism on the march , '' Obama said , paraphrasing the famous aphorism by Mao 's successor that capitalistic policies were acceptable if they helped China . `` You couldn \u2019 t anticipate that . ''\nIt was surprising to hear Obama , normally more restrained in how he discusses the Iran nuclear deal , refer to it , however cautiously , as a moment when the arc of history might curve .\nIt was one of several interesting moments during an intimate 90-minute meeting Obama held with 10 journalists in the Roosevelt Room at the White House on Wednesday . What follows is a description of that conversation and what it reveals about how the president sees the nuclear deal and the larger problems of the Middle East , as well as the opposition to the deal , a subject he returned to frequently and at times with a visceral frustration that seemed to verge on disgust .\nBut Obama 's primary message was one of certainty . That the meeting was on the record \u2014 such gatherings , a routine event at the White House , are normally off the record \u2014 spoke to this , as did his easy manner and his eagerness to discuss fine-grained details of the deal , as well as criticisms .\n`` Of all the foreign policy issues that I 've addressed since I 've been president , '' he said , `` I 've never been more certain that this is sound policy , that it 's the right thing to do for the United States , that it 's the right thing to do for our allies . ''\nSince world powers had reached the agreement on limiting Iran 's nuclear program , three weeks earlier in Vienna , Obama has calibrated his remarks on the deal to a narrow political mission : Get it enough support to get past Congress . That has meant emphasizing only ways in which the deal will serve US ( and Israeli ) security interests to limit Iran 's nuclear program , and downplaying everything else .\nTo hear him draw a connection between the nuclear deal and China 's transformation , then , was striking . It suggested that Obama , though he has repeatedly insisted he does not expect the character of Iran 's regime to change , does see it as a possibility , one potentially significant enough that it evokes , at least in his mind , President Nixon 's historic trip to China .\nAt the same time , the lesson Obama seemed to draw from the comparison was not that he , too , was on the verge of making history , but rather that transformations like China 's under Deng , opportunities like Nixon 's trip , can have both causes and consequences that are impossible to foresee . His role , he said , was to find `` openings '' for such moments .\nHe cited his 2012 trip to Myanmar \u2014 the first ever by a sitting president , and part of his effort to reopen the dictatorship to the world \u2014 and his detente with Cuba .\n`` Much of the time , we are making judgments based on percentages , and no decision we make in foreign policy is completely without hair on it ''\nWith regards to Myanmar , also known as Burma , `` we still don \u2019 t know yet how that experiment plays itself out , '' he said . In listing Myanmar 's reforms since his trip , he mistakenly referred to dissident Aung San Suu Kyi running for president \u2014 in fact , the regime has barred her from running \u2014 before realizing his error and correcting himself . It was an unintentionally revealing comment , hinting at the ways that reforms can reverse and `` openings '' can close .\n`` We don \u2019 t know whether it \u2019 s going to get over the hump and suddenly Burma is completely transformed , or whether it retrenches as the generals in that country get scared about losing their privileges and prerogatives , '' he went on . `` But what we \u2019 ve done is we \u2019 ve created a possibility for change . ''\nHis point seemed to be that he could imagine such a possibility for an opening in Iran as well , though the results were uncertain . He said of Iran 's future , echoing his point about Myanmar , `` We don \u2019 t know how it \u2019 s going to play itself out . ''\nFrom there , Obama drifted back to discussing what he had brought us to the White House to discuss , which was his case for the Iran nuclear deal , which meant reasserting , as he had many times before , that the deal did not assume Iran 's good behavior on nuclear issues but rather that it was a means for enforcing it .\nHe was careful at all times not to premise the deal on Iran 's good intentions , much less the country undergoing any sort of transformation . Still , in that unguarded moment , he seemed to suggest a hope that the deal could help create `` a possibility for change '' all the same .\nSeveral times , Obama was asked \u2014 and resisted answering \u2014 a simple question : What is his plan if the deal falls apart ?\nCongress , for example , could block the deal , something that looked more possible by Friday , when Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer announced he would oppose it . Yet while Obama was eager to talk about why killing the deal would be bad , all the ways that it would allow Iran 's nuclear program to proceed and set back US foreign policy , he refused to say what he would do if that happened . At one point , when one of the journalists present began asking about his plan B , Obama cut him off , joking that he wanted to save the journalist from wasting his question .\nPolitically , it 's understandable that he 'd refuse to answer : if he says he has no Plan B , he would look foolish , but if he says he has a good plan B , he would make it easier for Republicans to justify killing the deal . Yet it 's an important question .\nThe closest he got to providing an answer was when he was challenged on whether the only alternative to the deal was really war , as he 's frequently asserted . He did not describe a clear plan B , but he did rule out a number of options .\n`` I do not say that a military option is inevitable just to be provocative , just to win the argument . Those are the dictates of cold , hard logic , '' he said .\nObama himself may not know whether he would follow through on his threat to strike Iran as a last resort\nIf Congress killed the deal , `` doubling down on unilateral sanctions '' against Iran would not be enough , he said , to get another deal . And he was `` quite certain '' that it would not be possible to `` force our P5+1 partners [ the world powers that are party to the nuclear deal ] or other countries , like India or South Korea or even Japan '' to go along with Congress 's demand to set a new , higher bar for what the nuclear deal has to accomplish .\nIf that happens , he said , `` we \u2019 ve sort of run out of options at that point . ... At minimum , what we \u2019 ve done is we \u2019 ve put Iran in the driver \u2019 s seat . '' In one scenario , he said , Iran could pull out of the deal and resume its nuclear development immediately : `` The scenario that everybody talks about happening 15 years from now happens six , nine , 12 months from now . ''\nIn another scenario , Iran would declare its intention to abide by the deal . Sanctions would fall away , Russia and China would exploit the opening to hijack the process , and the US would possibly , he said , be excluded from the inspections regime and enforcement systems set up by the deal . In other words , the US would get shut out of the very process of monitoring Iran 's behavior that it had set up .\n`` In that scenario , then , Iran is going to get some of that sanction relief anyway , and our credibility in terms of now being able to exercise any influence on how the Security Council thinks about this thing has been completely eroded , '' he said . `` I \u2019 d have to talk to the lawyers as to what standing we would even have , since Congress would have rejected this deal , for us to be a party to it , in which case we \u2019 re not in the room , potentially . ''\nAny of these , he said , would make it easier for Iran to grow its nuclear program and harder for the US to do anything about it : `` In almost every scenario , our ability to monitor what \u2019 s happening in Iran , our ability to ensure that they are not breaking out , our ability to inspect their facilities , our ability to force them to abide by the deal has gone out the window . ''\nObama would not spell out what he planned to do in such a scenario , but he did say he would try to piece together a new sanctions coalition , though he was not optimistic about it . `` Maybe it \u2019 s possible that for a certain period of time we can hang on to the Europeans \u2014 not certain ; maybe . Maybe we can twist some arms to have some of our Asian allies hang on , '' he said .",
