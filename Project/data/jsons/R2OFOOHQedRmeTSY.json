    "content_original": "Nearly 63 million adults voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 election, and our conscientious media will not rest until each and every Typical Trump Voter within that seething morass has been located, interviewed, profiled, photo-captioned, pondered, and tagged for future taxidermy. Their opinions, no matter how uninformed and frequently la-la, are solemnly recorded as clues to the mood of the country, which always seems to range from disgruntled to thoroughly disgusted. The process to determine what constitutes a Typical Trump Voter is unwritten, unspoken, and uncodified, but in practice he or she is drawn straight from central casting. Suburban couples who look as if they just stepped hand in hand out of an episode of HGTV\u2019s House Hunters don\u2019t make the cut: too bougie and lacking the weathered grain of hard times. Sunbelt retirement villages that went big for Trump occasionally get the extended look-in (\u201cGeneration Pickleball: Welcome to Florida\u2019s Political Tomorrowland,\u201d by Michael Grunwald, Politico Magazine, June 18, 2018), but the residents, living it up like Del Boca Vista aristocrats, are too set in their ways to offer a gritty dramatis personae for a journalistic parable about Americans in a time of jarring transition.\n\nEditors are looking for stories on Trump voters who are making do, soldiering on, hanging tough, wishing each other \u201cMerry Christmas\u201d instead of that heathen \u201cHappy Holidays,\u201d and extending the president the benefit of the doubt no matter how many times he does them rotten.
