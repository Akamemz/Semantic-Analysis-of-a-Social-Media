''\nLollie explains to the officer that he has been sitting in a public area for 10 minutes and protests that he does n't have to tell her his name because he had not broken any laws .\n`` The problem is I 'm black , '' Lollie interrupts . `` It really is , because I 'm not sitting there with a group of people .
