    "content": "FBI and Justice Department officials have told congressional investigators in recent days that they have not been able to verify or corroborate the substantive allegations of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign made in the Trump dossier , according to a recent report .\nThe inability to verify any of the dossier \u2019 s allegations about collusion or conspiracy came during face-to-face briefings with congressional staff , sources told the Washington Examiner \u2018 s chief political correspondent Byron York .\nThe inability to verify any collusion or conspiracy is significant , since the dossier may have triggered the FBI \u2019 s investigation into the Trump campaign , which has now become the special counsel investigation led by Robert Mueller .\nThe first installment of the dossier came on June 20 , 2016 . The author of the dossier , ex-British spy Christopher Steele , told Mother Jones he went to the FBI in early July of 2016 , and former FBI Director James Comey told members of the House intelligence committee the investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia came in late July of 2016 .\nIt has also recently come to light that the dossier was funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee .
