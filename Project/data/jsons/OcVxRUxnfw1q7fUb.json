After all , he faced allegations that he initiated unwanted sexual contact with teenage girls when he was in his 30s . ( Moore has denied the allegations , dismissing them as \u201c fake news . \u201d )\nBut now Moore has decided to run for the Senate again . On Thursday , the former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court announced his bid \u2014 and his new campaign can \u2019 t be entirely written off . Yes , Moore is defying the wishes of many Republicans , including President Trump , who said in a tweet last month that \u201c Roy Moore can not win. \u201d But Moore still has a passionate base of support , particularly among conservative evangelical Christians . So the main question for his candidacy moving forward will be whether he can attract voters beyond his base .\nAs things stand , he could have enough backing to reach a primary runoff \u2014 Alabama requires a nominee to win a majority of the primary vote or the top-two candidates must face off in a subsequent election . However , while Moore would probably struggle to win the majority support necessary to advance to the general election , others in the field might have weaknesses Moore could exploit .\nWith Moore \u2019 s announcement , there are now four notable candidates running , with a fifth set to join the race . The two early surveys of the Republican primary field that we do have suggest that Moore could earn support from 18 to 27 percent of the primary electorate . It \u2019 s unclear , though , how much Moore can raise his ceiling of potential support . And that \u2019 s because many in his own party have a negative opinion of him . In April , 29 percent of Alabama Republican voters in a Mason-Dixon poll said they had an unfavorable opinion of Moore , with 34 percent having a favorable opinion and 33 percent neutral . And according to an internal poll recently released by primary rival Tommy Tuberville , a former Auburn University football coach , Moore \u2019 s net favorability among Republicans was worse than any of his rivals . Put simply , these numbers are a far cry from the 2017 primary , when Republicans liked Moore more than either of his two main opponents : then-Sen. Luther Strange , who had been appointed to the post , and Rep. Mo Brooks .\nBut there is one factor working in Moore \u2019 s favor \u2014 a crowded primary field . Because the eventual GOP nominee stands a good chance of beating Jones in the general election ( Alabama is 27 points more Republican than the country as a whole ) , even more candidates could join the race . A large primary field may fragment the vote , making it unlikely that a candidate could win a majority and avoid a runoff and making it easier for Moore to advance to a runoff with only the support of his base .\nSo far , Rep. Bradley Byrne and the aforementioned Tuberville are the major contenders , but it appears that Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill is also gearing up to run after filing with the Federal Election Commission . ( He has said will announce his decision next week . ) Additionally , State Rep. Arnold Mooney received an endorsement from the Senate Conservatives Fund , a political action committee that backs conservative Republicans . There is also the chance that former Attorney General Jeff Sessions will decide to run for his old seat and clear the field , a possibility suggested earlier this week by Republican Sen. Richard Shelby , Alabama \u2019 s senior senator .\nBut if Moore does finish in the top two in the primary \u2014 without winning a majority \u2014 and makes it to a runoff , it still would be really hard for him to clinch the GOP nomination . That \u2019 s because he could no longer run as a factional candidate . But never say never \u2014 some of Moore \u2019 s major opponents have potential weaknesses . A political outsider , Tuberville might have an attractive profile in football-mad Alabama , but he voted in Florida just last November , opening him up to \u201c carpetbagger \u201d attacks . Byrne , probably the establishment favorite at this point , had a hard time in past primary battles for governor ( he lost ) and representative ( he narrowly won ) , and he was critical of Trump in the 2016 cycle , although he did support the GOP ticket in the end .\nThe point is that Moore does have a path \u2014 especially a path to a primary runoff if there \u2019 s a crowded GOP field . And if he does get there , he would be only one step away from a rematch with Jones . National Republicans may have an \u201c Anyone But Moore \u201d attitude , and GOP groups would undoubtedly pound Moore with negative ads , but remember that a Trump endorsement of Strange couldn \u2019 t stop Moore in 2017 . So it \u2019 s not impossible that Moore does end up winning his party \u2019 s nomination .\nTrump said \u201c the consequences will be devastating \u201d to his agenda if that happens . And that might be true \u2014 Moore would probably improve Jones \u2019 s chances of winning reelection . ( Jones even egged on Moore to run again . ) But even as damaged as he is , Moore would still have a decent chance of winning a general election in conservative Alabama , and that is surely a big part of why he \u2019 s running again .",
