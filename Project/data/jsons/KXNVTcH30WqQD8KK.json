    "content": "Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz has found evidence that an FBI lawyer manipulated a key investigative document related to the FBI 's secretive surveillance of a former Trump campaign adviser -- enough to change the substantive meaning of the document , according to multiple reports .\nThe show-stopping development comes as Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , told Fox News that Horowitz 's comprehensive report on allegations of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) warrant abuse against former Trump campaign aide Carter Page will be released on Dec. 9 . `` That 's locked , '' Graham said .\nThe new evidence concerning the altered document , which pertained to the FBI 's FISA court warrant application to surveil Page , is expected to be outlined in Horowitz 's upcoming report . CNN first reported the news , which was largely confirmed by The Washington Post .\nBut the Post , hours after publishing its story , conspicuously removed the portion of its reporting that the FBI employee involved worked `` beneath '' Peter Strzok , the FBI 's since-fired head of counterintelligence . The Post did not offer an explanation for the change , which occurred shortly after midnight . Earlier this week , the DOJ highlighted a slew of anti-Trump text messages sent by Strzok when he was leading the Hillary Clinton email investigation and the probe into the Trump campaign .\n`` The person under scrutiny has not been identified but is not a high-ranking official \u2014 they worked beneath former deputy assistant director Peter Strzok , according to people familiar with the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss material that has not yet been made public , '' The Post wrote in its now-deleted paragraph .\nWAYBACK MACHINE SHOWS ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE POST 'S STORY , BEFORE STEALTH DELETION\nThe paper eventually added a correction to the bottom of its piece , reading , `` Correction : An earlier version of this story erroneously stated that the FBI employee being investigated for altering a document worked underneath former Deputy Assistant Director Peter Strzok . The employee was a low-level lawyer in the Office of General Counsel and did not report to the deputy assistant director . ''\nNevertheless , Horowitz reportedly found that the FBI employee was involved enough in the FISA process to falsely state that he had `` documentation to back up a claim he had made in discussions with the Justice Department about the factual basis '' for the FISA warrant application , the Post reported . Then , the FBI employee allegedly `` altered an email '' to substantiate his inaccurate version of events . The employee has since been forced out of the bureau .\nIn its initial 2016 FISA warrant application , the FBI flatly called Page `` an agent of a foreign power . ''\nSources told Fox News last month that U.S. Attorney John Durham 's separate , ongoing probe into potential FBI and Justice Department misconduct in the run-up to the 2016 election through the spring of 2017 has transitioned into a full-fledged criminal investigation -- and that Horowitz 's report will shed light on why Durham 's probe has become a criminal inquiry .\nFBI AGENTS MANIPULATED FLYNN FILE , AS CLAPPER ORDERED 'KILL SHOT , ' FILING SAYS\nDurham has reportedly taken up Horowitz 's findings concerning the falsified FISA document , meaning the ex-FBI lawyer who made the changes is now under criminal investigation . The Post indicated , however , that the document was not central to the legality of the FISA warrant obtained against Page .\nRepublicans have long argued that the FBI 's alleged FISA abuses , which came as the bureau aggressively pursued ultimately unsubstantiated claims of criminal links between the Trump team and Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign , were politically motivated . In recent months , a series of unearthed documents has strengthened those claims .\nJust nine days before the FBI applied for its first FISA warrant to surveil Page , bureau officials were battling with a senior Justice Department official who had `` continued concerns '' about the `` possible bias '' of a source pivotal to the application , according to internal text messages previously obtained by Fox News .\nThe 2016 messages , sent between Lisa Page and then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe , also revealed that bureau brass circulated at least two anti-Trump blog articles , including a Lawfare blog post sent shortly after Election Day that called Trump possibly `` among the major threats to the security of the country . ''\nDOJ OUTLINES STRZOK 'SECURITY VIOLATIONS ' ; FINDS 'PARANOID ' CASE AGENT NOTICED STRZOK WAS SITTING ON WEINER LAPTOP\nFox News is told the texts were connected to the ultimately successful Page application , which relied in part on information from British ex-spy Christopher Steele \u2013 whose anti-Trump views are now well-documented \u2013 and cited Page \u2019 s suspected Russia ties . In its warrant application , the FBI inaccurately assured the FISA court on numerous occasions that media sources independently corroborated Steele 's claims , and did not clearly state that Steele worked for a firm hired by Hillary Clinton 's campaign and the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) .\nMuch of the Steele dossier has been proved discredited or unsubstantiated , including the dossier 's claims that the Trump campaign was paying hackers in the United States out of a non-existent Russian consulate in Miami , or that ex-Trump lawyer Michael Cohen traveled to Prague to conspire with Russians . Special Counsel Robert Mueller also was unable to substantiate the dossier 's claims that Carter Page had received a large payment relating to the sale of a share of Rosneft , a Russian oil giant , or that a lurid blackmail tape involving the president existed .\nDespite being accused by the FBI of being a Russian agent in the FISA application , and being secretly surveilled for more than a year , Page has not been charged with any wrongdoing . He has since sued numerous actors -- including the DNC -- for defamation related to claims that he worked with Russia .\nDISPUTE ERUPTS AS BRENNAN , COMEY APPEAR TO DISPUTE WHO PUSHED THE STEELE DOSSIER\n`` OI [ Office of Intelligence ] now has a robust explanation re any possible bias of the chs [ confidential human source ] in the package , '' Lisa Page wrote to McCabe on Oct. 12 , 2016 . `` Do n't know what the holdup is now , other than Stu 's continued concerns .
