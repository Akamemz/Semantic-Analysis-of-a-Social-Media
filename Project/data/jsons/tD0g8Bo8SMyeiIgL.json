My kid can \u2019 t afford to go to college , I am having a hard time affording healthcare . How does that happen ? While at exactly the same time , 99 percent of all new income generated in this country is going to the top one percent . How does it happen ?

It can \u2019 t continue . We can \u2019 t continue having a nation in which we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of any major nation on earth at the same time as we are seeing a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires. \u201d 3 .
