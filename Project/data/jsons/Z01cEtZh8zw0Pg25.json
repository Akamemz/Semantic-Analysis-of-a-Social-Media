    "content": "Like an estimated 22 million other Americans , I am a self-employed small-business owner who buys health insurance for my family directly on the individual market . We have a high-deductible PPO plan that allows us to choose from a wide range of doctors .\nLast week , our family received notice from Anthem BlueCross BlueShield of Colorado that we can no longer keep the plan we like because of `` changes from health care reform ( also called the Affordable Care Act or ACA ) . '' The letter informed us that `` ( t ) o meet the requirements of the new laws , your current plan can no longer be continued beyond your 2014 renewal date . ''\nRemember ? Our president looked America straight in the eye and promised : `` If you like your doctor , you will be able to keep your doctor . Period . If you like your health care plan , you will be able to keep your health care plan . Period . No one will take it away . No matter what . ''\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , also lied when she pledged : `` Keep your doctor , and your current plan , if you like them . ''\nThis is n't just partisan business . It 's personal . Our cancellation letter states that Anthem is `` not going to be selling new individual PPO plans . '' When we asked whether we could keep our children 's doctors , an agent for Anthem told my husband and me she did n't know . The insurer has no details available yet on what exactly they 'll be offering . We either will be herded into the Obamacare federal health insurance exchange regime ( launching October 1 ) , a severely limited HMO plan , or presented with costlier alternatives from another insurer . If they even exist .\nMy family is not alone . Across the country , insurers are sending out Obamacare-induced health plan death notices to untold tens of thousands of other customers in the individual market . Twitter users are posting their Obamacare cancellation notices and accompanying rate increases :\nLinda Deright posted her letter from Regency of Washington state : `` 63 percent jump , old policy of 15 yrs . cancelled . '' Karen J. Dugan wrote : `` Received same notice from Blue Shield CA for our small business . Driving into exchange and no info since online site is down . '' Chris Birk wrote : `` Got notice from BCBS that my current health plan is not ACA compliant . New plan 2x as costly for worse coverage . '' Small-business owner Villi Wilson posted his letter from HMSA Blue Cross Blue Shield canceling his individual plan and added : `` I thought Obama said if I like my health care plan I can keep my health care plan . ''\nFew among Washington 's protected political class are paying attention , because they enjoy their lucrative government benefits and are exempted from Obamacare 's destructive consequences . But one of my state 's congressional representatives , GOP Rep. Cory Gardner , also lost his individual market plan . Unlike most politicians on Capitol Hill , Gardner chose not to enroll in the federal health insurance program . He told me that he opted to participate in the private market `` because I wanted to be in the same boat as my constituents . And now that boat is sinking ! ''\nGardner points to recent analysis showing individual market rate increases of 23 percent to 25 percent in Colorado . `` After my current plan is discontinued , '' he wrote last week , `` the closest comparable plan through our current provider will cost over 100 percent more , going from roughly $ 650 a month to $ 1,480 per month .

The National Association for the Self-Employed is recommending that its small-business owners and freelancers plan for at least a 15 percent increase nationwide . One of the reasons for those rate hikes , of course , is that Obamacare 's mandated benefits provisions force insurers to carry coverage for items that individual market consumers had deliberately chosen to forgo .\nAmericans who had opted for affordable catastrophic coverage-style plans now have fewer and fewer choices . This includes a whole class of musicians , photographers , artists , writers , actors and other creative people who purchased health plans through the individual market or through small professional organizations .
