But Chinese President Xi Jinping's top economic adviser is heading to Washington this week for more negotiations.\n\nAmerican companies will also have a chance to publicly tell the Trump administration what they think about its planned tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nHere's what to keep an eye on this week.\n\n1. What will happen to ZTE?\n\nThe fate of Chinese technology company ZTE (ZTCOF) has become a major flashpoint in the US-China trade tensions.\n\nLast month, the US Commerce Department blocked American firms from selling parts or providing services to ZTE, which makes smartphones and other telecommunications equipment. The ban was put in place after Washington said ZTE violated a deal in which the Chinese company agreed to pay a $1.2 billion fine for evading US sanctions on Iran and North Korea.\n\nRelated: ZTE is now center stage in the US-China trade fight\n\nZTE, which employs around 75,000 people worldwide, has disputed the decision and is appealing it.

The Commerce Department has been \"instructed\" to get ZTE back into business, he added.\n\nTrump's announcement -- welcomed Monday by Beijing -- should create a more positive backdrop for trade talks.\n\n\"The Trump administration is softening its stance and stepping back from using the most destructive weapon in the negotiation,\" said Ken Cheung, a currency strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong. \"The second round of negotiation should be more constructive.\"\n\n2. Round 2 of trade talks\n\nThat second round of talks is happening this week.\n\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He will lead a Chinese delegation visiting Washington from Tuesday through Saturday, China's Foreign Ministry said Monday.\n\n\"I suspect Liu will try to engage with his Treasury counterpart, Steven Mnuchin, whom the Chinese see as the most willing to make a deal,\" said Richard McGregor, senior fellow at the Lowy Institute, a think tank based in Sydney.\n\nRelated: China says 'big differences' remain after US trade talks\n\nThe scale of the challenge facing negotiators was highlighted by a widely reported list of demands that the US delegation gave to the Chinese government before the first round of talks. It included cutting the US trade deficit with China by $200 billion by the end of 2020 and halting Chinese subsidies for advanced technology industries.\n\nMcGregor, an expert on Chinese politics and international relations, said he doesn't think Liu will offer any big concessions on the trade deficit, but will rather focus on measures to open up China's markets to more American investment.\n\n3. US businesses have their say\n\nWhile Liu is in Washington, American companies will be airing their views on the Trump administration's plan to slap tariffs on around $50 billion worth of Chinese goods as punishment for alleged intellectual property theft.\n\nAmong the big US companies that have asked to testify at the hearings are Best Buy (BBY), HP (HPQ) and US Steel (X). Lobbying groups seeking to take part include the National Retail Federation and the National Association of Manufacturers.\n\nThe hearings start Tuesday and are scheduled to last three days.\n\nThe US government has published a list of 1,300 Chinese exports that it plans to target with tariffs of 25%, many of them in advanced manufacturing industries such as aerospace.\n\nRelated: Who likes tariffs?
