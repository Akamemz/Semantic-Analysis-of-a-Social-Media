    "content": "ATLANTA \u2013 The Atlanta police chief stepped down Saturday in the wake of the death of a 27-year-old Black man who was shot by an officer while fleeing during a struggle at a Wendy 's drive-thru late Friday night , according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation . Hours later , police and National Guards troops clashed with protesters outside the fast-food restaurant .\nRayshard Brooks had been asleep in his car at the drive-thru , causing other customers to drive around the car , the Bureau of Investigation said . Police were dispatched to the Wendy 's around 10:30 p.m. , and conducted a sobriety test on Brooks , who failed the test , according to the officials .\n`` During the arrest , the male subject resisted and a struggle ensued , '' the Bureau of Investigation said . `` The officer deployed a Taser . Witnesses report that during the struggle the male subject grabbed and was in possession of the Taser . It has also been reported that the male subject was shot by an officer in the struggle over the Taser . ''\nOne officer was treated for an injury and discharged after the confrontation . Brooks died in the hospital after surgery .\nPolice Chief Erika Shields is immediately stepping down after the shooting , Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced in a news conference Saturday afternoon . She also called for the termination of the police officer who shot Brooks and for another officer to be placed on administrative duty .\n`` While there may be debate as to whether this was an appropriate use of deadly force , I firmly believe that there is a clear distinction between what you can do and what you should do . I do not believe that this was a justified use of deadly force , '' Bottoms said .\nBottoms said Shields would continue in a different role `` to be determined '' in the police department .\n`` To the family of Mr. Brooks , there are no words strong enough to express how sincerely sorry I am for your loss . I do hope that you will find some comfort in the swift actions that have been taken today , '' she said .\nBottoms called Shields a `` solid member of APD for over two decades . ''\n`` And because of her desire that Atlanta be a model of what meaningful reform should look like across this country , Chief Shields has offered to immediately step aside as police chief so that the city may move forward with urgency in rebuilding the trust so desperately needed throughout our community , '' Bottoms said .\nOn Saturday night , several hundred people gathered in the parking lot of the Wendy \u2019 s where Brooks encountered the police . Some chanted `` say his name '' and carried signs that read `` He didn \u2019 t deserve to die '' and `` convict the killer cop . '' The restaurant was closed to patrons .\nTyler Brown , 29 , said he was one of the first protesters to arrive at Wendy \u2019 s Saturday morning after learning about Brooks \u2019 death on social media . Brown , who lives just a few blocks away , said , the community is baffled at why the the officer felt the need to kill Brooks .\n\u201c Honestly I \u2019 m tired of it , \u201d Brown said . \u201c No matter what you do , you \u2019 re unarmed , you \u2019 re not a threat , you \u2019 re down on the ground in handcuffs , and they still feel the need to put the knee on your neck or shoot you . \u201d\nKayla Pruitt , 24 , of Atlanta , said the cries from protesters in recent weeks seem to have fallen on deaf ears with police .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve been out here for a couple weeks now and y \u2019 all still killing folks , \u201d said Pruitt , who arrived Saturday at the Wendy 's to protest police violence . \u201c It \u2019 s like have y \u2019 all heard nothing anybody has said ? \u201d\nThe peaceful protest suddenly turned violent around 8:30 p.m. after National Guard troops arrived toting guns . Some protesters began surrounding one police car and rocking it . Other protesters surged on the police and troops without touching them , forcing the law enforcement officials to walk backwards from the crowd . After a few minutes , the law enforcement officials released several canisters of tear gas into the crowd , sending the protesters fleeing in panic .\nProtesters later shut down an interstate highway in both directions and set fire to the Wendy \u2019 s restaurant where Brooks was fatally shot the night before .\nIt 's unclear why Brooks was sleeping in his car at the drive-thru Friday night .\nWendy \u2019 s surveillance video published by the Bureau of Investigations Saturday afternoon appears to show officers arriving in a vehicle to the drive-thru parking lot . The vehicle can be seen pulling up to another car , but the officers and Brooks can not be seen in the video .\nAbout half an hour later , Brooks can be seen running away from two officers , who chase after him . As Brooks runs away , he turns back toward one officer and points the Taser , and that officer fires his weapon . Brooks falls to the ground and appears to remain motionless .\nAs the two officers approach Brooks on the ground , bystanders can be seen getting out of their cars and recording video .\nGeorgia Bureau of Investigation Director Vic Reynolds said Saturday afternoon the agency had gathered surveillance video from the Wendy 's , police body cam video and bystander video posted to social media . The agency had spoken with at least one witness , who corroborated the videos , Reynolds said .\n`` It does appear in the video that he is fleeing from the Atlanta police officers , '' Reynolds said .\nReynolds said he not sure how many shots were fired .
