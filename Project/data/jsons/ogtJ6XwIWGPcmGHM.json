    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) Late-night rancor erupted at President Donald Trump 's impeachment trial on a first day of formal arguments that previewed a divisive and fact-bending showdown that epitomizes the nature of his presidency and will cause years of aftershocks .\nDemocrats forced 100 senators sitting as Trump 's jurors to endure repeated and futile votes to over witnesses testimony and evidence , stretching well into the early hours of Wednesday morning and driving home their view that Republicans are thwarting a fair trial that would dig up the truth about the Ukraine scandal .\n`` Yeah , we 're making it hard for you , we 're making it hard for you to say no , '' lead House impeachment manager Rep. Adam Schiff told senators who became increasingly tired and restless as the night wore on .\n`` We making it hard for you to say ' I do n't want to hear from these people , I do n't want to see the documents , ' ... Our job is to make it hard to deprive the American people of a fair trial , '' Schiff said .\nAt one point early Wednesday morning , Chief Justice John Roberts was forced to intervene to cool ugly exchanges between the rival legal teams .\n`` I think it is appropriate for me to admonish both the house managers and the president 's counsel in equal terms to remember that they are addressing the world 's greatest deliberative body , '' Roberts said . `` One reason it has earned that title is because its members avoid speaking in a manner and using language that is not conducive to civil discourse .\nAnd any dim hopes that the trial could stir a moment of national catharsis and a path out of the most bitter political crisis in decades are already dead after a rancorous day . The debate stretched long past midnight into Wednesday morning .\nSenators sat for hours , deprived of their phones and social media , listening to a stunning case : Democrats outlined evidence that Trump had solicited political favors from a foreign nation -- Ukraine -- using nearly $ 400 million in taxpayer aid and then mounted a massive cover-up to hide his actions .\nRepublican senators , forced to sit mostly in silence during the presentation , can no longer ignore the incriminating evidence against the President . Even still , stark political factors -- including Trump 's stronghold on the GOP base -- mean there will be no surprises about how most of them plan to vote .\nSchiff , warned his fellow lawmakers that they could pay a price for suppressing the real story of what had happened between Trump and Ukraine .\n`` The truth will come out -- the question is , will it come out in time ? '' the California Democrat asked , making a simple case that Trump 's actions abused a public trust and endangered the character of the republic .\nWhite House counsel Pat Cipollone , meanwhile , adopted the strategies of Trump 's House defenders , who largely chose not to dispute the evidence but alleged a wider conspiracy that the President 's enemies had always been bent on overthrowing him and depriving him of due process .\n`` The only conclusion will be that the President has done absolutely nothing wrong , and that these articles of impeachment do not begin to approach the standard required by the Constitution , '' Cipollone said .\nIt was still a surreal moment , at 1 p.m . ET , to see Roberts take the gavel as senators met to decide whether Trump should be the first President in US history convicted on articles of impeachment to be removed from office .\nThe two rival teams , Schiff and his fellow impeachment managers and Trump 's legal brain trust , sat arrayed at tables set up in front of the chamber , as members dug in for a long day at their desks , broken only by the odd trip to get some candy or a dinner break well into Wednesday morning .\nBut for all the historic echoes , the day soon became like any other in the Trump era when mind-bending debates erupted over the nature of basic facts and ill will between the parties clogged Congress ' most basic duty -- holding a President to account .\nThe central question on Tuesday was whether the trial can be seen to be fair .\nIn one unexpected twist , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , apparently seeking to shield vulnerable swing state senators under pressure to back a fair trial , relented on a schedule that had envisaged testimony in two marathon 12-hour days from each side .

Susan Collins of Maine , said it was `` likely '' that she would vote to call new witnesses later in the trial .\nTwo GOP aides told CNN that the changes by McConnell were meant to assuage concerns of moderate Republicans -- who the majority leader needs to win next November in order to keep hold of the chamber .
