That climate , Rubio said , has the country \u201c careening toward chaos and anarchy . \u201d\n\u201c We settle our differences in this country at the ballot box , not with guns or bayonets or violence , \u201d Rubio told reporters .\n\u201c You wonder if we \u2019 re headed in a different direction today where we \u2019 re no longer capable of having differences of opinion but in fact now protests become a license to take up violence and take on your opponents physically , \u201d he said . \u201c This is what happens when a leading presidential candidate goes around feeding into a narrative of bitterness and anger and frustration . \u201d\nKasich , who has run a uniquely positive campaign in one of the ugliest presidential cycles in modern political history , struggled to express his disgust with what he \u2019 s seeing in Trump \u2019 s events .\n\u201c Yesterday when you asked me about the violence , I didn \u2019 t know what you were talking about because I didn \u2019 t see it , \u201d he told reporters . \u201c But I saw it last night and put a statement out last night . And I \u2019 m sort of to the point where I \u2019 ve had enough of this . So the fact of the matter is you take things a day at a time . I do not believe , and frankly I \u2019 m a little shocked that we got to this point . I \u2019 m shocked at it . \u201d\nRoughly an hour after Rubio and Kasich had made their comments , Trump \u2019 s rally near Cincinnati offered further illustration of how the simmering tensions he has stoked with incendiary rhetoric for months are boiling over as he gets closer to becoming the GOP nominee . As he was speaking in an airplane hangar , a protester attempted to jump onto the stage , startling Trump and drawing four Secret Service agents to encircle him immediately as they subdued the protester .\n\u201c It \u2019 s gotten to a danger point , \u201d Rubio said later Saturday afternoon in an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 aboard his campaign bus in Tampa . While the senator was quick to condemn violent protesters for their behavior , he laid much of the blame on Trump for inciting a mob . \u201c I \u2019 m also not going to excuse the fact that Donald Trump at his events , has seen an increased amount of violence and aggression against reporters , against the protesters , against the spectators \u2026 you name it . It \u2019 s gotten \u2014 American politics is turning into the comments section of a blog , where there [ are ] no limits now on what you can say or what you can do or not do . \u201d\nIn September , Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus sought to stabilize his party \u2019 s nomination contest by persuading all the GOP candidates to sign a pledge to support the eventual nominee . But as the GOP coalition continues to splinter from Trump \u2019 s success , Priebus has been reluctant to join a growing chorus of anti-Trump conservatives that even includes Mitt Romney , the party \u2019 s most recent presidential nominee .\n\u201c The party itself \u2014 led by Reince Priebus \u2014 is scared to death of Trump and his supporters , \u201d said a Republican operative in Washington who worked on behalf of a candidate who has since left the race .\nAn RNC spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment .\nTwo weeks ago , Rubio undercut his own \u201c Never Trump \u201d message by promising in the Detroit GOP debate , along with the party \u2019 s three remaining presidential candidates , that he would support the party \u2019 s nominee no matter who it might be .\nBut the unrest in Chicago , which capped off a week of violent altercations between Trump supporters and protesters that included a white man who was videotaped punching a black protester as he was being escorted out of an arena , is changing the equation for the senator \u2014 along with the heightened urgency of a candidate who may be running out of time .\n\u201c The job of a true leader is not to stoke people \u2019 s pain , \u201d Rubio said . \u201c Because when you do that , there are consequences . There are consequences to that , and they \u2019 re playing out before our eyes . \u201d\nRubio criticized Trump less strongly in Thursday \u2019 s Miami debate \u2014 yet , more directly than Ted Cruz and Kasich did \u2014 by saying that presidential candidates have to consider the consequences of their words .\nOn Saturday , he suggested that everyone step back and contemplate their own responsibility in a social order that appears to be \u201c coming apart at the seams . \u201d\n\u201c No matter what our differences are , who wants to live in a country where everyone hates each other over everything ? \u201d\nRubio also laid blame on the media \u2019 s reality TV-style coverage of the campaign \u2014 and on himself for briefly submitting to it .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not proud of some of the things I said about Donald Trump , \u201d Rubio told supporters . \u201c And that will never happen again . But I spent 10 months and 28 days campaigning on issues , and no one covered it . The media has failed us in this discourse as well . \u201d\nCruz , aiming to emerge on Tuesday as the only candidate standing against Trump , held firm to his pledge to support whoever wins the Republican nomination .\nTrump has defended his supporters and blamed protesters for the violence , and Saturday in Cleveland , he found a new target : supporters of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders .\n\u201c Bernie was saying , Mr. Trump should speak to his crowd , \u201d he said . \u201c You know where they come from ? Bernie \u2019 s crowd . \u201d\n\u201c Bernie \u2019 s people , \u201d Trump said , were disrupting his rallies \u201c every five minutes. \u201d Trump mocked Sanders repeatedly and then added : \u201c Wouldn \u2019 t it be fun to meet Bernie in the finals ? \u201d\nThe Cleveland rally was repeatedly interrupted by protesters , as Trump again insisted his supporters aren \u2019 t violent . \u201c My people aren \u2019 t violent . It \u2019 s these people that come in . My people want to do one thing . Make America great again . \u201d\nAt his rally , Trump \u2019 s team also worked to display his support among nonwhites and non-Christians : Positioned directly behind the podium were supporters waving signs \u201c Muslim Americans for Trump \u201d and \u201c Sikh Americans for Trump. \u201d He also reiterated promises to bring more heavy industry back to the U.S. , saying a 35 percent tax on imported products would stop companies from relocating overseas .\nOn Friday in St. Louis , before the mayhem in Chicago , Trump had complained to the crowd that there are not `` consequences '' for protesters who disrupt his events .\n\u201c Part of the problem and part of the reason it takes so long [ to kick them out ] is nobody wants to hurt each other anymore , \u201d Trump said at the Peabody Opera House . \u201c There used to be consequences . There are none anymore . ... These people are so bad for our country . You have no idea , folks , you have no idea . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s Cleveland rally featured several interruptions by protesters , and the scene suggested the threat of violence is becoming a frightening new normal during the Trump campaign .\nAs the rally cleared , a few dozen mostly black protesters who had edged close to the arena found themselves quickly surrounded and penned in by Trump supporters , and a shouting match ensued . Protesters chanted `` Dump Trump '' but were quickly drowned out by pro-Trump cheers .
