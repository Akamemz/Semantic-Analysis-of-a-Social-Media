    "content": "Tuesday night \u2019 s Republican presidential debate was the first since the Islamic State-inspired terrorist shooting in San Bernardino , California , and not surprisingly , most of the questions tossed out by CNN moderators dealt with national security and terrorism . In the days since San Bernardino , public fears over terrorism have grown , and President Obama has been doing what he can to tamp down anxiety and encourage people not to give in to the fear that terrorists work to inspire . But as the CNN debate made painfully clear , the Republican presidential candidates have quite the opposite goal in mind : They want everyone to be scared witless by the looming terrorist menace and worried that they will be the next to die .\nNew Jersey Gov . Chris Christie , back on the main stage thanks to CNN \u2019 s expansive inclusion rules and his own improved poll numbers in New Hampshire , did the most to actively scare the shit out of every person unfortunate enough to be watching . In his opening statement he announced that \u201c America has been betrayed \u201d by \u201c the leadership that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have provided to this country. \u201d As proof of that betrayal and treason , Christie pointed to yesterday \u2019 s closing of the Los Angeles Unified School District \u201c based on a threat. \u201d He never got around to mentioning that the \u201c threat \u201d had long since been revealed as a hoax . But still Christie was worried about the \u201c children filled with anxiety , \u201d and the \u201c mothers who will take those children tomorrow morning to the bus stop , \u201d and the \u201c the fathers of Los Angeles , who tomorrow will head off to work and wonder about the safety of their wives and their children. \u201d They live in terror , these nameless gendered stereotypes , because Obama couldn \u2019 t protect them from the threat posed by \u201c madbomber @ cock.li . \u201d\nAsked what he would do to ensure that fear does not \u201c paralyze \u201d American in the aftermath of terrorism , Christie explained that paralyzing fear is , unfortunately , \u201c the new normal under Barack Obama. \u201d \u201c Everywhere in America is a target for these terrorists , \u201d he said , giving everyone a reason to be afraid always . Christie \u2019 s closing statement was a riff on 9/11 . \u201c Many of our friends and others in our neighborhood lost their lives that day. \u201d Christie even offered himself as a menacing presence , leaning forward and shifting back and forth behind his lectern like a rhinoceros sizing up a Jeep full of safari tourists . His message all evening was blunt and terrifying : you will die , unless you vote for me .\nNot far behind Christie was Sen. Marco Rubio , who made a point of spelling out in detail the menacing nature of the Islamic State . \u201c This is the most sophisticated terror group that has ever threatened the world or the United States of America , \u201d he warned . \u201c This is a very significant threat we face . And the president has left us unsafe. \u201d He made a special point of noting the Islamic State \u2019 s sophistication : \u201c This is a radical jihadist group that is increasingly sophisticated in its ability , for example , to radicalize American citizens\u2026 This is not just the most capable , it is the most sophisticated terror threat we have ever faced. \u201d He warned about \u201c the next time there is an attack on this country \u201d while pushing for reinstatement of metadata collection provisions in the Patriot Act .\nSen. Ted Cruz went a slightly different route , linking Republican panic over Syrian refugees to both the San Bernardino terrorist attack ( which had nothing to do with refugees ) and the 2013 Senate immigration reform bill to score a bank-shot hit on Rubio :\nCRUZ : Because the front line with ISIS is n't just in Iraq and Syria , it 's in Kennedy Airport and the Rio Grande . Border security is national security . And , you know , one of the most troubling aspects of the Rubio-Schumer Gang of Eight Bill was that it gave President Obama blanket authority to admit refugees , including Syrian refugees without mandating any background checks whatsoever . Now we 've seen what happened in San Bernardino . When you are letting people in , when the FBI ca n't vet them , it puts American citizens at risk .\nAll in all it was a grim , bleak , and frightful debate that saw several leading candidates try to stoke heightened public anxiety over terrorism . There were no acknowledgements that acts of terrorism are exceptionally rare , with just \u201c 45 Americans killed in jihadist terrorist attacks \u201d since 9/11 . ( More Americans have died as a result of homegrown right-wing terrorism , but that threat didn \u2019 t earn a single mention at the debate , even though one such attack took place just days before San Bernardino . ) This was more about resurrecting the national security politics of the Bush years , when Republicans would conjure the threat of imminent terrorist slaughter on American soil to cast Democrats as weak and to justify the rollback of civil liberties in the interest of safety .
