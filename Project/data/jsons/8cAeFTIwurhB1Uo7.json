Nico Perrino is director of communications for the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education and host of So to Speak : The Free Speech Podcast .\nThe events in Charlottesville last weekend have provoked understandable fear and outrage . Potential sites for future \u201c alt-right \u201d rallies are on edge . Texas A & M University , the University of Florida and Michigan State University have all decided to cancel or deny prospective events by white nationalist Richard Spencer . All cited safety concerns . All raise serious First Amendment issues .\nEven though we \u2019 ve been called \u201c free speech absolutists \u201d \u2014sometimes , but not always , as a compliment\u2014we will not pretend that Spencer \u2019 s speaking cancellations make for a slam-dunk First Amendment lawsuit . Yes , hateful , bigoted and racist speech is fundamentally protected under the First Amendment , as it should be . However , if we \u2019 re honest about the law , we have to recognize that Spencer faces tough\u2014though not insurmountable\u2014legal challenges .\nFirst , he is not a student at any of the aforementioned universities and was not invited to the campuses by students or faculty . He was seeking space on campus that is available to the general public to rent out . In at least some cases , courts have found that public colleges have a somewhat freer hand to regulate the speech of non-students on campus who are not invited by students or faculty .\nSecond , although a general , unsubstantiated fear of violence is not enough to justify cancelling an approved speaking event , recent violence in Charlottesville and the fact that one of the organizers of the Texas A & M rally used the promotional tagline \u201c TODAY CHARLOTTESVILLE TOMORROW TEXAS A & M \u201d make security concerns more concrete , at least in the short term . The more concrete the security concerns are , the easier it is to justify the cancellation or denials .\nThird , as David Frum , Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern point out , judges might decide cases differently when protesters are liable to show up brandishing guns , as happened in Charlottesville . Bad facts make bad law , so the saying goes . The general legal standard now is that if a public college opens itself up to outside speakers , it can not engage in viewpoint discrimination . Most cases of prior restraint censorship will fail in court under this standard . But in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy in Charlottesville , judges may look differently at these facts .\nAnd that should trouble us : If a court decides in favor of the prior restraints , it could set a precedent that would do considerable harm to the free speech rights of speakers , students and faculty far beyond Spencer .\nBut what happens in a court of law is one thing . What happens in the court of public opinion is perhaps more important . As the famous jurist Learned Hand once said , \u201c Liberty lies in the hearts of men and women ; when it dies there , no constitution , no law , no court can save it . \u201d\nAnd , unfortunately , there is evidence that freedom of speech needs a pacemaker .\nIf your social media newsfeed doesn \u2019 t provide ample anecdotal evidence that free speech is suffering a public relations crisis , look to the polling : A recent Knight Foundation study found that fewer than 50 percent of high school students think that people should be free to say things that are offensive to others .\nThe New York Times opinion page , for its part , has run three columns since April questioning the value of free speech for all , the most recent imploring the ACLU to \u201c rethink free speech \u201d \u2014the same ACLU that at the height of Nazism , Communism and Jim Crow in 1940 released a leaflet entitled , \u201c Why we defend civil liberty even for Nazis , Fascists and Communists. \u201d The ACLU of Virginia carried on this honorable tradition of viewpoint-neutral free speech defense in the days before the Charlottesville protests . However , the Wall Street Journal reported this week that the ACLU \u201c will no longer defend hate groups seeking to march with firearms . \u201d\nAnd how is the birthplace of the 1960s free speech movement faring ? In the wake of the riots that shut down alt-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos \u2019 speech at the University of California , Berkeley on February 1 , multiple students and alumni wrote that the violence and destruction of the Antifa protests were a form of \u201c self-defense \u201d against the \u201c violence \u201d of Yiannopoulos \u2019 speech . Watching videos of the protest , it is fortunate nobody was killed .\nWhat \u2019 s to account for this shift ? One of our theories is that this generation of students comprises the children of students who went to college during the first great age of campus speech codes that spanned from the late 1980s through the early 90s . This is when colleges and universities first began writing over-broad and vague policies to regulate allegedly racist and sexist speech . Although that movement failed in the court of law , these codes have stubbornly persisted , and the view that freedom of speech is the last refuge of the \u201c three Bs \u201d \u2014the bully , the bigot and the robber baron\u2014found a home in classrooms .\nWhen we speak on college campuses , our explanations of the critical role the First Amendment played in ensuring the success of the civil rights movement , the women \u2019 s rights movement and the gay rights movement are often met with blank stares . At a speech at Brown University , in fact , a student laughed when Greg pointed out that Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall was a steadfast defender of freedom of speech\u2013\u2013as if it were impossible for a black icon of the civil rights movement to be a free-speech champion .\nHowever , we don \u2019 t fault students for holding these opinions . The idea of free speech is an eternally radical and counterintuitive one that requires constant education about its principles . Censorship has been the rule for most of human history . True freedom of speech is a relatively recent phenomenon . It perhaps reached its high point in the United States in the second half of the 20th century .\nMost Americans claim that they venerate free speech in principle . So do most world leaders . Even censorial dictators like Turkey \u2019 s Recep Tayyip Erdogan sometimes feign support for it . Despite this , it \u2019 s common for people to have their exceptions in practice : their \u201c I believe in free speech , but \u2026 \u201d responses . But even the \u201c free speech , but \u2026 \u201d responses seem to be falling out of favor . In the last few years\u2014and especially after Charlottesville\u2014we have observed increasing squeamishness about free speech , and not just in practice ; also in principle .\nSo how do we respond to the calls for censorship after Charlottesville ?\nFor most of our careers , the charge \u201c what if the Nazis came to town ? \u201d has been posed as a hypothetical retort to free speech defenses . ( Godwin \u2019 s law extends to free speech debates , too . ) But the hypothetical is no longer a hypothetical : In Charlottesville , neo-Nazis carried swastikas through the streets and revived the Hitler salute .\nIf you were to listen to scholars like Richard Delgado , the response should be to pass laws , to put people in jail , to do whatever it takes to stop the Nazi contagion from spreading . It \u2019 s a popular argument in Europe and in legal scholarship , but not in American courts .\nThere are a few problems with this response that free speech advocates have long recognized . For one , it doesn \u2019 t necessarily work ; since the passage of Holocaust denial and anti-Semitism laws in Europe , rates of anti-Semitism remain higher than in the U.S. , where no such laws exist . In fact , the Anti-Defamation League found that rates of anti-Semitism have gone down in America since it first began measuring anti-Semitic attitudes in 1964 .\nWe can not forget , too , that laws have to be enforced by people . In the 1920s and early 30s , such laws would have placed the power to censor in the hands of a population that voted in large numbers for Nazis . And after 1933 , such laws would have placed that power to censor in the hands of Hitler himself . Consider how such power might be used by the politician you most distrust . Consider how it is currently being used by Vladimir Putin in Russia .\nWhat does history suggest as the best course of action to win the benefits of an open society while stemming the tide of authoritarians of any stripe ? It tells us to have a high tolerance for differing opinions , and no tolerance for political violence . What distinguishes liberal societies from illiberal ones is that liberal societies use words , not violence or censorship to settle disputes .

When Bavarian authorities banned speeches by Hitler in 1925, for example, the Nazis exploited it. As former ACLU Executive Director Aryeh Neier explains in his book Defending My Enemy, the Nazi party protested the ban by distributing a picture of Hitler gagged with the caption, \u201cOne alone of 2,000 million people of the world is forbidden to speak in Germany.\u201d The ban backfired and became a publicity coup. It was soon lifted.\n\nWe cannot forget, too, that laws have to be enforced by people. In the 1920s and early 30s, such laws would have placed the power to censor in the hands of a population that voted in large numbers for Nazis. And after 1933, such laws would have placed that power to censor in the hands of Hitler himself. Consider how such power might be used by the politician you most distrust.
