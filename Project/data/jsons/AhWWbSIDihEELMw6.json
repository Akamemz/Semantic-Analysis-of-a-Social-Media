So many white working-class Americans in their 40s and 50s were dying of suicide , alcoholism and drug abuse that the overall mortality rate for the age group was no longer falling \u2013 a rare and shocking pattern in a modern society .\nBut as Case and Deaton continued digging into the data , it became clear that the grim trends didn \u2019 t apply only to middle-aged whites .

But over the past three decades , deaths of despair among whites without a college degree \u2014 especially those under age 50 \u2014 have soared . The death rate for whites with a college degree , by contrast , has risen only modestly across all age groups and remains lower for the young than the old .\nCase and Deaton \u2014 a married couple who are both economists at Princeton \u2014 try to explain the causes in a new book , \u201c Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism. \u201d Their basic answer is that working-class life in the United States is more difficult than it is in any other high-income country . \u201c European countries have faced the same kind of technological change we have , and they \u2019 re not seeing the people killing themselves with guns or drugs or alcohol , \u201d Case says . \u201c There is something unique about the way the U.S. is handling this . \u201d\nMore people are dying Number of \u201c deaths of despair \u201d per 100,000 non-Hispanic whites aged 45-54 Non- college 100 50 College grads 0 1992 1996 2000 2004 2008 2012 2016 Non- college 100 50 College grads 0 1992 \u2018 96 \u2018 00 \u2018 04 \u2018 08 \u2018 12 \u2018 16\nInequality has risen more in the United States \u2014 and middle-class incomes have stagnated more severely \u2014 than in France , Germany , Japan or elsewhere .
