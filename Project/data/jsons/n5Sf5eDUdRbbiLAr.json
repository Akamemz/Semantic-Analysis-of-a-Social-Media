John Oliver\u2019s 3-part series on gun control in Australia\n\nAustralia implemented strict gun control measures after mass shootings, something that the U.S. has still failed to do \u2014 so John Oliver went to investigate.

But Oliver\u2019s series was so good, and he hosted the \u201cDaily Show\u201d this summer and now he has left the show forever, so let\u2019s give him some extra love, okay? Anyway, if you missed his series on gun control, here\u2019s your chance to catch up on it. You\u2019re welcome.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n3. Jessica Williams\u2019s stop-and-frisk parody\n\nThere could be a separate \u201cbest of\u201d category devoted to Jessica Williams\u2019s segments on race in America, including the recent bit on food stamps. In \u201cFrisky Business,\u201d the \u201cDaily Show\u201d correspondent exposes the hypocrisy and racism of Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s stop-and-frisk program in a brilliant parody that profiles those who commit white-collar crimes.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n4. Stephen Colbert\u2019s feud with MTV\n\nAfter Daft Punk pulled out of a \u201cColbert Report\u201d performance at the last minute, the comedian was so angry that he spoiled the band's \"surprise\" VMA performance in a segment that turned out better than any musical performance would have been.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nMocking MTV, Colbert said, \u201cIf Daft Punk were on my show, people wouldn\u2019t tune in to see them on the VMAs almost a month from now. That\u2019s how music works. You love a band, you see them once, then never want to see them again. That\u2019s why after the Beatles went on Ed Sullivan, they dropped off the face of the Earth. I think Ringo ended up working as a train conductor.\u201d\n\n5. Aasif Mandvi\u2019s interview with a racist GOP leader\n\nAasif Mandvi uncovered a national scandal in the form of North Carolina GOP leader Don Yelton, who said he supported controversial voter ID laws because \u201cIf [the law] hurts the whites so be it. If it hurts a bunch of lazy blacks that want the government to give them everything, so be it.\u201d The segment caused such an uproar that Yelton resigned from his position nearly overnight, and went on air to defend himself the next day.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t take back anything I said,\u201d he told radio host Pete Kaliner. \u201cWould I do it again?

Fox\u2019s War on Christmas\n\nThe \u201cDaily Show\u201d jokes basically write themselves every December, when it\u2019s time for Fox to whine about the so-called War on Christmas. This year, Megyn Kelly was enraged by the idea of a black Santa Claus.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n7. CNN\u2019s terrible reporting\n\nThe terribleness of CNN is well-established on both \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d\n\nand \u201cThe Colbert Report,\u201d but The Best F#@king News Team Ever's parody of CNN\u2019s shoddy news coverage is a thing of beauty.\n\n8. Shitstorm 2013 (aka the Government Shutdown)\n\nIt\u2019s hard to choose just one of Jon Stewart\u2019s rage-filled verbal assaults on the GOP during the government shutdown, but the one where he calls House Republicans a bunch of \u201cself-righteous Orwellian zebra queefs\u201d seems like a pretty safe bet.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n9. \u201cPointless Counter Pointless\u201d\n\nCelebrating the return of a show no one missed, CNN\u2019s \u201cCrossfire,\" Colbert hosted parody program \u201cPointless Counter Pointless,\u201d during which special guests Oscar the Grouch and Big Bird debated \u201cthe most controversial topics of our time,\u201d like the letter \u201cS.\u201d\n\n10. Stephen Colbert gets Bill Clinton on Twitter\n\nIt may not have been one of the show's most hilarious moments, but getting former president Bill Clinton to admit his insecurity with Twitter and join the social media site with the handle \"PrezBillyJeff\" is pretty amazing. \u201cI\u2019m insecure,\" admitted Clinton. \"What if you tweet, and nobody tweets back?\u201d",
