It would include a boost in the number of visas for high-tech workers , a new guest-worker program and elimination of some categories of visas for extended family members .\nOne of the sticking points has been a dispute over wages for lower-skilled temporary workers , which pits the U.S. Chamber of Commerce against the AFL-CIO .
