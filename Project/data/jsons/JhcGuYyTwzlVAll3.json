    "content": "With near-total bans on abortion passing in state after state \u2014 and others responding by loosening restrictions on the procedure \u2014 the right to terminate a pregnancy is emerging as a major election issue in 2020 .\nWhen CNN pollsters asked Iowa Democratic voters earlier this month what issues were must-haves in a presidential candidate , support for abortion rights came out on top , with 79 percent of in-person caucus-goers listing it as crucial . And on Saturday , voters got to hear 20 of the 24 Democratic presidential candidates speak on abortion and broader issues of reproductive justice , including sex education and contraceptive access , at a forum convened by Planned Parenthood .\nEarlier this year , many candidates condemned the restrictive anti-abortion laws passing in Alabama and elsewhere , but fewer put forth specific policies for defending reproductive rights . Sens . Kirsten Gillibrand , Kamala Harris , Elizabeth Warren , and Cory Booker stood out from the field by issuing detailed plans for safeguarding abortion access .\nSince then , more candidates have made policy statements , like expressing support for the Women \u2019 s Health Protection Act , which would enshrine in federal statute the right to an abortion guaranteed by Roe v. Wade . But \u2588\u2588\u2588 wanted to take a holistic look at the abortion rights policies of all 24 candidates in the race . So we asked all of them what their positions were on abortion rights and access , and what policies they \u2019 d support to make this a reality .\nWhile not every candidate responded to \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s direct inquiry , all 24 have discussed their position on abortion rights in some capacity in the past . For the candidates who did not respond to our request , we examined statements they \u2019 ve made in interviews , town halls , and reports in other publications including BuzzFeed , ThinkProgress and HuffPost .\nSome of the candidates offered \u2588\u2588\u2588 more details than others about how they \u2019 d protect reproductive rights . Booker , for example , said he would create a White House Office of Reproductive Freedom , while Harris said she \u2019 d require states that have passed laws that violate Roe in recent years to obtain DOJ approval for any abortion-related laws they \u2019 d like to implement down the line .\nBut what stands out at this point in the Democratic primary campaign \u2014 and was highlighted at the Planned Parenthood forum on Saturday \u2014 is the extent to which the candidates have converged around a series of policies on abortion that would have seemed remarkably progressive just five years ago , especially when it comes to the Hyde Amendment , which bans federal funding for most abortions . As the Republican Party has backed increasingly restrictive laws , the Democratic Party has responded by moving toward increasing and multilayered support for abortion rights .\n\u201c What \u2019 s going on in this country right now is not just an attack on women , \u201d Warren said at the Planned Parenthood forum on Saturday . \u201c It \u2019 s an attack on women who have fewer resources . It \u2019 s a class attack on women . It \u2019 s a race attack . \u201d\nHer words encapsulated what has , at this point , become a shared position among virtually the entire Democratic field : that abortion should be not just legal but affordable and accessible for all Americans .\nMany Democrats have converged on a set of policies to protect abortion rights and access\nIn our survey , a few commonalities quickly emerged . Many of the candidates we heard from support the following policies :\nRepealing the Hyde Amendment . The ban on federal funding for abortions bars Medicaid from covering the procedure , putting it out of reach for many low-income Americans . The president doesn \u2019 t have the power to repeal Hyde ; that authority rests with Congress . But presidential pressure to repeal Hyde still matters , and since Hyde was often treated as politically untouchable before 2016 , the fact that so many Democratic candidates now back its repeal is a sign of the times .\nThe ban on federal funding for abortions bars Medicaid from covering the procedure , putting it out of reach for many low-income Americans .

Like a repeal of Hyde , this is something only Congress could accomplish . Repealing the domestic and global gag rules . Like every Republican president since Reagan , President Trump reinstated the global gag rule , which bars organizations abroad that take American aid from providing or discussing abortion ( Trump expanded this rule to apply to a larger pool of money than in previous administrations ) . He then went further by imposing a domestic gag rule , barring organizations in the United States that receive federal family planning funds under Title X from providing or referring patients for the procedure . Unlike repealing Hyde or codifying Roe , this is something a president could do without help from Congress . It \u2019 s also a reminder that the Trump administration has taken a number of actions to restrict both abortion and contraceptive access ; the next president would have the power to roll any of these back .\nLike every Republican president since Reagan , President Trump reinstated the global gag rule , which bars organizations abroad that take American aid from providing or discussing abortion ( Trump expanded this rule to apply to a larger pool of money than in previous administrations ) .

Wade to the federal court system . Trump made the opposite promise in 2016 and has made good on it by appointing Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court , as well as judges seen as anti-abortion to lower federal courts ; it \u2019 s largely because of his appointments that Roe is at risk today . It \u2019 s unclear how many opportunities the next president will have to make a Supreme Court appointment , but lower federal judges also hold great influence over the interpretation of abortion law . And , like repealing the gag rules , this is an action the president can take ( though judges do require congressional approval ) .\nGiven how similar the candidates \u2019 response are overall , we spoke with NARAL , an advocacy group that \u2019 s fought for stronger protections for abortion rights , about how to best differentiate them .\nThe key thing to look out for , according to NARAL vice president of communications Adrienne Kimmell , is more specifics . Since repealing Hyde and codifying Roe have become baseline positions , candidates who are able to offer more details in their proposals suggest that they \u2019 ve engaged with the issue further .\n\u201c Voters should look for candidates who step up with concrete plans to protect access to care and guarantee reproductive freedom for every American , \u201d she says . \u201c We \u2019 re heartened to see that candidates like Elizabeth Warren , Kamala Harris , Cory Booker , and Kirsten Gillibrand are already leading the way by announcing specific plans laying out how they would defend reproductive freedom . \u201d\nSome of the Democratic candidates support abortion rights policies beyond the commonly shared positions on Hyde and Roe as well . It \u2019 s also important to note that while we chose to focus on abortion for the purpose of this survey , many advocates see that right as part of a larger spectrum of issues , including maternal health ( the subject of another survey to be published soon ) and equal access to health care for people of all races and genders .\nHere \u2019 s where the candidates stand on abortion based on responses they shared \u2014 and other public statements\n\u201c I believe in Roe v. Wade , \u201d the senator said at a Fox News town hall in May . \u201c Of course , there are limits there in the third trimester that are very important , \u201d she added . \u201c But I think overall , what we want to do is make sure women have the right to make their own decisions . \u201d\nIn an interview with Fox News later that month , she said , \u201c If the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade I would make sure that we are codifying Roe v. Wade into law. \u201d She has also co-sponsored legislation to repeal the Hyde Amendment .\nAt the Planned Parenthood forum , she added that if elected , she would repeal the domestic and global gag rules . She also mentioned the importance of \u201c making sure that we have judges that follow the law of the land \u201d when it comes to Roe v. Wade .\nThe entrepreneur supports codifying Roe , repealing Hyde , and providing \u201c safe and affordable abortion services \u201d to all Americans . \u201c I have the feeling that if men became pregnant instead of women , there would be absolutely no restriction on reproductive rights , \u201d he said in a statement on his campaign website .\nAt the Planned Parenthood forum , Yang also said that his plan to give all Americans a universal basic income of $ 1,000 a month would help low-income people afford abortion care .\n\u201c Bernie believes that abortion is a constitutional right for all women , \u201d said Sarah Ford , deputy communications director for the Sanders campaign .\nThe senator supports a Roe litmus test for judges , and his Medicare-for-all plan would make abortion free to all patients , effectively making the Hyde Amendment moot . \u201c Abortion rights are part of what Medicare-for-all is , \u201d he said at the Planned Parenthood forum .\nSanders is also a co-sponsor of the Women \u2019 s Health Protection Act , which would codify Roe in federal statute .\nThe former Congress member from Texas has released a reproductive rights plan that includes repealing Hyde and guaranteeing private insurance coverage for abortion , codifying Roe in statute , and \u201c appointing judges who respect Roe v. Wade as the settled law of the land. \u201d He also promises , if elected , to reverse the Trump administration \u2019 s domestic gag rule . And he says he would direct the Food and Drug Administration to remove \u201c labeling regulations that impose barriers to the use of medication-based abortions . \u201d\n\u201c Beto would mobilize the full force of the federal government to protect women \u2019 s reproductive rights and access to abortion , \u201d a spokesperson for the campaign told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c Throughout Beto \u2019 s career , he has fought to protect women \u2019 s access to health care and their right to make their own decisions about their bodies , dating back to his first run for Congress where he took on a Democratic primary opponent who opposed federal funding for Planned Parenthood . \u201d\nThe mayor has supported repealing Hyde . He \u2019 s previously called out former Vice President Joe Biden for his prior position backing Hyde . \u201c If you don \u2019 t support repeal , you shouldn \u2019 t be the Democratic nominee , \u201d de Blasio tweeted .\nNew York City has also been at the forefront of expanding abortion rights during de Blasio \u2019 s tenure . Most recently , it became the first city in the country to directly fund abortions .\nThe senator released a reproductive rights plan on May 22 , amid the passage of state-level abortion bans around the country . In it , he pledges to work to repeal Hyde and codify Roe in statute , as well as to nominate judges who are supportive of Roe .\nIn addition , he promises to take a number of executive actions to protect reproductive rights , including ending the domestic and global gag rules , reversing the Trump administration \u2019 s guidelines prioritizing abstinence-based programs for federal teen pregnancy prevention funding , and undoing the administration \u2019 s rules allowing health care providers to refuse to perform abortions on the basis of their \u201c conscience \u201d or religion .\nIf elected , the senator says he would also create a White House Office of Reproductive Freedom , \u201c charged with coordinating and affirmatively advancing abortion rights and access to reproductive health care across my administration \u2014 addressing all barriers to full reproductive autonomy , such as access to health care , including maternal and infant health , quality , affordable child care , and comprehensive paid family leave . \u201d\nAt the Planned Parenthood forum , Booker called on men to stand up for reproductive rights . \u201c This is not a woman \u2019 s issue , \u201d he said . \u201c Don \u2019 t tell me just because you have a wife or a mother or a daughter , that that \u2019 s how you relate to this . You have a body . \u201d\nWarren was among the first candidates to put forth a detailed reproductive rights plan . The plan , released May 17 , calls for codifying Roe in statute , repealing Hyde and the domestic gag rule , and guaranteeing private insurance coverage for abortion .\n\u201c We must build a future that protects the right of all women to have children , the right of all women to not have children , and the right to bring children up in a safe and healthy environment , \u201d Warren wrote in announcing her plan .\nSwalwell is an original co-sponsor of the EACH Woman Act , which would repeal Hyde . He is also a co-sponsor of the Women \u2019 s Health Protection Act and of legislation to repeal the global gag rule . As president , he would support codifying Roe in statute , according to his campaign .\n\u201c We will defend Roe v. Wade and a woman \u2019 s right to choose at all costs , \u201d Swalwell said in a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c As president , I \u2019 ll work with Congress to protect women \u2019 s control of their own bodies without government interference and ensure women in every state retain access to abortion care . But I also want to encourage America \u2019 s young men to stand up and link arms with women in this fight \u2014 we need to be vocal , active allies in defending freedom . \u201d\n\u201c I will be a president who negotiates up on this issue rather than down , \u201d he promised at the Planned Parenthood forum .\nInslee supports repealing Hyde and codifying Roe in statute , his campaign said . As governor , he signed Washington state \u2019 s Reproductive Parity Act , which guarantees public and private insurance coverage for abortion , and he would support similar legislation as president . He would also repeal both domestic and global gag rules ; the attorney general of Washington state was one of several to sue the Trump administration to block the domestic rule .\nAfter stating in early June that he supports Hyde , Biden changed course and says he now believes the amendment should be repealed . At the Planned Parenthood forum , he said that he had changed positions on Hyde because his health care plan would need to include coverage of abortion .\n\u201c I laid out a health care plan that \u2019 s going to provide federally funded health care for all women and women who now are denied even Medicare in their home states , \u201d he said . \u201c It became really clear to me that although the Hyde Amendment was designed to try to split the difference here , to make sure women still had access , you can \u2019 t have access if everyone \u2019 s covered by a federal policy . That \u2019 s why at the same time I announced that policy , I announced that I could no longer continue to abide by the Hyde Amendment . \u201d\nThe former vice president also supports codifying Roe in statute and repealing the global gag rule , according to his campaign . A practicing Catholic , Biden has said he is personally opposed to abortion . But , he said at a vice presidential debate in 2012 , \u201c I just refuse to impose that on others . \u201d\nDelaney supports repealing the Hyde Amendment , according to his campaign . His universal health care plan , BetterCare , would cover reproductive health care , including abortions .\nThe former Colorado governor supports repealing Hyde and increasing and protecting Title X family planning funding . \u201c Governor Hickenlooper always has been a strong advocate of a woman \u2019 s right to choose , \u201d a spokesperson for his campaign said . \u201c He believes that all decisions should be made between a woman , her faith , and her doctor . \u201d\nThe former housing and urban development secretary has committed to nominating judges and Cabinet members who are \u201c pro-choice. \u201d Additionally , he backs repealing Hyde and codifying Roe v. Wade . \u201c All women should have access to reproductive care , regardless of their income or the state they live in , \u201d he previously tweeted .\nHarris is among the Democrats who \u2019 s offered a more detailed plan on abortion rights that seeks to curb state laws attempting to infringe on them . Under Harris \u2019 s proposal , which is modeled after the Voting Rights Act , states whose abortion-related laws have recently been struck down by courts for violating Roe would have to obtain federal approval from the Justice Department before they \u2019 re able to implement any new abortion laws .\n\u201c As president , I will stop dangerous state laws restricting reproductive rights before they go into effect , \u201d Harris said in a statement . She also backs undoing Hyde , making Roe v. Wade law , and appointing judges that support abortion rights .\nAt the Planned Parenthood forum , Harris pledged \u201c to do the work on the defense , and to fight , but also work on the offense \u201d when it comes to abortion rights .\nGillibrand has made gender equity and reproductive rights a central piece of her campaign and is considered a leader on the issue . She was the first 2020 Democrat to commit to appointing judges that support Roe , and in the wake of state laws restricting abortion access laid out a wide-ranging plan to protect abortion rights .\nIn addition to repealing Hyde and codifying Roe , Gillibrand supports undoing the gag rule the Trump administration has imposed . She would also establish a new funding stream in order to ensure that every state has a reproductive health center .\n\u201c We must come together to declare , loud and clear , that reproductive rights are human rights . They are civil rights . And they are nonnegotiable , \u201d she wrote in a Medium post .\nThe author and spiritual adviser , who has described herself as \u201c one hundred percent pro-choice , \u201d backs codifying Roe and repealing the Hyde Amendment .\n\u201c I believe the decision of whether or not to have an abortion lies solely with the pregnant woman , according to the dictates of her conscience and in communion with the God of her understanding , \u201d she notes on her campaign website . \u201c I do not feel the government has an appropriate right to deny or restrict that decision . \u201d\nBennet supports \u201c enshrining Roe v. Wade into federal statute , preempting states that try to interfere with women \u2019 s health rights , repealing the Hyde Amendment , and standing up against other efforts to undermine access to necessary care , \u201d according to a campaign spokesperson .\n\u201c Women \u2019 s reproductive rights are under assault all over the United States . Women \u2019 s health care is under assault all over the United States , \u201d he said during a CNN town hall earlier this year . Bennet has also said he would only appoint judges that back Roe .\nFormer Alaska Sen. Gravel , a candidate who \u2019 s notably in the race in order to prompt debate , has an expansive and unique abortion rights agenda . Gravel \u2019 s landmark provision would tie an individual \u2019 s ability to become a specialized physician with a commitment to providing abortions .\n\u201c Our signature point on abortion access is mandating the ability and willingness to provide an abortion as a condition of obstetrician licensing , \u201d according to a campaign spokesperson . \u201c In addition , we support a constitutional amendment guaranteeing a right to an abortion , as well as lawmaking through the People \u2019 s legislature , a fourth branch of government that Mike Gravel supports setting up that would allow direct lawmaking by the American people . \u201d\nGravel also backs repealing Hyde and codifying Roe into law .\nButtigieg supports repealing Hyde , codifying Roe into law , and appointing judicial nominees who would support Roe . \u201c The mayor is pro-choice and trusts women to make their own health care decisions . He also recognizes the harm in having men legislate women \u2019 s bodies , \u201d said a campaign spokesperson .\nButtigieg has previously called for more men to speak out about abortion . \u201c I think it \u2019 s particularly important from a political stance for men to stand up , \u201d he said during a campaign event earlier this year , according to HuffPost .\nMoulton backs the repeal of the Hyde Amendment and enshrining Roe in federal law . He \u2019 s said undoing Hyde ensures that all women have the funding they need for health care and compared it to the funding the military needs .\n\u201c It \u2019 s sort of like saying , you know , I support the troops but don \u2019 t want to pay them , \u201d Moulton said of Hyde in a CNN interview . \u201c That \u2019 s the analogy here , and I think it \u2019 s wrong . \u201d\nMoulton has also said he will exclusively appoint judges that support Roe and added that he backs Harris \u2019 s proposal to require DOJ review of certain state laws .\nBullock supports ending Hyde , codifying Roe , and strengthening Title X funding , which provides money for family planning and preventive health care clinics ( though the domestic gag rule currently restricts it to institutions that do not provide abortions ) .\n\u201c As governor , Bullock has stopped every single effort to restrict reproductive health care , and made Title X funding permanent so it would no longer be a political football , \u201d a campaign spokesperson said .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not what I think , it \u2019 s what does an individual woman need to do with her body and with her health care , \u201d Bullock recently told CNN .\nRyan supports codifying Roe and repealing Hyde . He had previously expressed opposition to abortion rights but explained in a 2015 editorial why he \u2019 s changed his position .\n\u201c I came in as a Catholic school kid from northeast Ohio who didn \u2019 t think a whole lot about the issue and went into Congress pro-life , \u201d Ryan told BuzzFeed . \u201c My opinion changed that there should not be anyone from the federal government between a woman and her doctor . \u201d\nGabbard is supportive of abortion rights , according to a campaign spokesperson , and would back using federal money to provide abortions . Gabbard has previously been anti-abortion but has since changed her position .\nMessam supports codifying Roe and using federal money to provide abortion services . He emphasized , in an interview with WBUR , that he sees Roe as \u201c settled law . \u201d\n\u201c I think when a woman is faced with a tough decision to abort a pregnancy , it \u2019 s tough enough by itself to have to make such a personal decision \u2014 a tough decision to make \u2014 and currently right now in our country this issue has been demagogued , and I think that primarily us men are making the decisions in the laws , \u201d he said .",

It\u2019s also important to note that while we chose to focus on abortion for the purpose of this survey, many advocates see that right as part of a larger spectrum of issues, including maternal health (the subject of another survey to be published soon) and equal access to health care for people of all races and genders.\n\nHere\u2019s where the candidates stand on abortion based on responses they shared \u2014 and other public statements\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN)\n\n\u201cI believe in Roe v. Wade,\u201d the senator said at a Fox News town hall in May. \u201cOf course, there are limits there in the third trimester that are very important,\u201d she added. \u201cBut I think overall, what we want to do is make sure women have the right to make their own decisions.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Fox News later that month, she said, \u201cIf the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade I would make sure that we are codifying Roe v. Wade into law.\u201d She has also co-sponsored legislation to repeal the Hyde Amendment.\n\nAt the Planned Parenthood forum, she added that if elected, she would repeal the domestic and global gag rules. She also mentioned the importance of \u201cmaking sure that we have judges that follow the law of the land\u201d when it comes to Roe v. Wade.\n\nAndrew Yang\n\nThe entrepreneur supports codifying Roe, repealing Hyde, and providing \u201csafe and affordable abortion services\u201d to all Americans. \u201cI have the feeling that if men became pregnant instead of women, there would be absolutely no restriction on reproductive rights,\u201d he said in a statement on his campaign website.\n\nAt the Planned Parenthood forum, Yang also said that his plan to give all Americans a universal basic income of $1,000 a month would help low-income people afford abortion care.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)\n\n\u201cBernie believes that abortion is a constitutional right for all women,\u201d said Sarah Ford, deputy communications director for the Sanders campaign.\n\nThe senator supports a Roe litmus test for judges, and his Medicare-for-all plan would make abortion free to all patients, effectively making the Hyde Amendment moot. \u201cAbortion rights are part of what Medicare-for-all is,\u201d he said at the Planned Parenthood forum.\n\nSanders is also a co-sponsor of the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, which would codify Roe in federal statute.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke\n\nThe former Congress member from Texas has released a reproductive rights plan that includes repealing Hyde and guaranteeing private insurance coverage for abortion, codifying Roe in statute, and \u201cappointing judges who respect Roe v. Wade as the settled law of the land.\u201d He also promises, if elected, to reverse the Trump administration\u2019s domestic gag rule. And he says he would direct the Food and Drug Administration to remove \u201clabeling regulations that impose barriers to the use of medication-based abortions.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeto would mobilize the full force of the federal government to protect women\u2019s reproductive rights and access to abortion,\u201d a spokesperson for the campaign told Vox. \u201cThroughout Beto\u2019s career, he has fought to protect women\u2019s access to health care and their right to make their own decisions about their bodies, dating back to his first run for Congress where he took on a Democratic primary opponent who opposed federal funding for Planned Parenthood.\u201d\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio\n\nThe mayor has supported repealing Hyde. He\u2019s previously called out former Vice President Joe Biden for his prior position backing Hyde. \u201cIf you don\u2019t support repeal, you shouldn\u2019t be the Democratic nominee,\u201d de Blasio tweeted.\n\nNew York City has also been at the forefront of expanding abortion rights during de Blasio\u2019s tenure. Most recently, it became the first city in the country to directly fund abortions.\n\nSen. Cory Booker (D-NJ)\n\nThe senator released a reproductive rights plan on May 22, amid the passage of state-level abortion bans around the country. In it, he pledges to work to repeal Hyde and codify Roe in statute, as well as to nominate judges who are supportive of Roe.\n\nIn addition, he promises to take a number of executive actions to protect reproductive rights, including ending the domestic and global gag rules, reversing the Trump administration\u2019s guidelines prioritizing abstinence-based programs for federal teen pregnancy prevention funding, and undoing the administration\u2019s rules allowing health care providers to refuse to perform abortions on the basis of their \u201cconscience\u201d or religion.\n\nIf elected, the senator says he would also create a White House Office of Reproductive Freedom, \u201ccharged with coordinating and affirmatively advancing abortion rights and access to reproductive health care across my administration \u2014 addressing all barriers to full reproductive autonomy, such as access to health care, including maternal and infant health, quality, affordable child care, and comprehensive paid family leave.\u201d\n\nAt the Planned Parenthood forum, Booker called on men to stand up for reproductive rights. \u201cThis is not a woman\u2019s issue,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me just because you have a wife or a mother or a daughter, that that\u2019s how you relate to this. You have a body.\u201d\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)\n\nWarren was among the first candidates to put forth a detailed reproductive rights plan. The plan, released May 17, calls for codifying Roe in statute, repealing Hyde and the domestic gag rule, and guaranteeing private insurance coverage for abortion.\n\n\u201cWe must build a future that protects the right of all women to have children, the right of all women to not have children, and the right to bring children up in a safe and healthy environment,\u201d Warren wrote in announcing her plan.\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA)\n\nSwalwell is an original co-sponsor of the EACH Woman Act, which would repeal Hyde. He is also a co-sponsor of the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act and of legislation to repeal the global gag rule. As president, he would support codifying Roe in statute, according to his campaign.\n\n\u201cWe will defend Roe v. Wade and a woman\u2019s right to choose at all costs,\u201d Swalwell said in a statement to Vox. \u201cAs president, I\u2019ll work with Congress to protect women\u2019s control of their own bodies without government interference and ensure women in every state retain access to abortion care. But I also want to encourage America\u2019s young men to stand up and link arms with women in this fight \u2014 we need to be vocal, active allies in defending freedom.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will be a president who negotiates up on this issue rather than down,\u201d he promised at the Planned Parenthood forum.\n\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee\n\nInslee supports repealing Hyde and codifying Roe in statute, his campaign said. As governor, he signed Washington state\u2019s Reproductive Parity Act, which guarantees public and private insurance coverage for abortion, and he would support similar legislation as president. He would also repeal both domestic and global gag rules; the attorney general of Washington state was one of several to sue the Trump administration to block the domestic rule.\n\nJoe Biden\n\nAfter stating in early June that he supports Hyde, Biden changed course and says he now believes the amendment should be repealed. At the Planned Parenthood forum, he said that he had changed positions on Hyde because his health care plan would need to include coverage of abortion.\n\n\u201cI laid out a health care plan that\u2019s going to provide federally funded health care for all women and women who now are denied even Medicare in their home states,\u201d he said. \u201cIt became really clear to me that although the Hyde Amendment was designed to try to split the difference here, to make sure women still had access, you can\u2019t have access if everyone\u2019s covered by a federal policy. That\u2019s why at the same time I announced that policy, I announced that I could no longer continue to abide by the Hyde Amendment.\u201d\n\nThe former vice president also supports codifying Roe in statute and repealing the global gag rule, according to his campaign. A practicing Catholic, Biden has said he is personally opposed to abortion. But, he said at a vice presidential debate in 2012, \u201cI just refuse to impose that on others.\u201d\n\nJohn Delaney\n\nDelaney supports repealing the Hyde Amendment, according to his campaign. His universal health care plan, BetterCare, would cover reproductive health care, including abortions.\n\nJohn Hickenlooper\n\nThe former Colorado governor supports repealing Hyde and increasing and protecting Title X family planning funding. \u201cGovernor Hickenlooper always has been a strong advocate of a woman\u2019s right to choose,\u201d a spokesperson for his campaign said. \u201cHe believes that all decisions should be made between a woman, her faith, and her doctor.\u201d\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro\n\nThe former housing and urban development secretary has committed to nominating judges and Cabinet members who are \u201cpro-choice.\u201d Additionally, he backs repealing Hyde and codifying Roe v. Wade. \u201cAll women should have access to reproductive care, regardless of their income or the state they live in,\u201d he previously tweeted.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris (D-CA)\n\nHarris is among the Democrats who\u2019s offered a more detailed plan on abortion rights that seeks to curb state laws attempting to infringe on them. Under Harris\u2019s proposal, which is modeled after the Voting Rights Act, states whose abortion-related laws have recently been struck down by courts for violating Roe would have to obtain federal approval from the Justice Department before they\u2019re able to implement any new abortion laws.\n\n\u201cAs president, I will stop dangerous state laws restricting reproductive rights before they go into effect,\u201d Harris said in a statement. She also backs undoing Hyde, making Roe v. Wade law, and appointing judges that support abortion rights.\n\nAt the Planned Parenthood forum, Harris pledged \u201cto do the work on the defense, and to fight, but also work on the offense\u201d when it comes to abortion rights.\n\nSen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY)\n\nGillibrand has made gender equity and reproductive rights a central piece of her campaign and is considered a leader on the issue. She was the first 2020 Democrat to commit to appointing judges that support Roe, and in the wake of state laws restricting abortion access laid out a wide-ranging plan to protect abortion rights.\n\nIn addition to repealing Hyde and codifying Roe, Gillibrand supports undoing the gag rule the Trump administration has imposed. She would also establish a new funding stream in order to ensure that every state has a reproductive health center.\n\n\u201cWe must come together to declare, loud and clear, that reproductive rights are human rights. They are civil rights. And they are nonnegotiable,\u201d she wrote in a Medium post.\n\nMarianne Williamson\n\nThe author and spiritual adviser, who has described herself as \u201cone hundred percent pro-choice,\u201d backs codifying Roe and repealing the Hyde Amendment.\n\n\u201cI believe the decision of whether or not to have an abortion lies solely with the pregnant woman, according to the dictates of her conscience and in communion with the God of her understanding,\u201d she notes on her campaign website. \u201cI do not feel the government has an appropriate right to deny or restrict that decision.\u201d\n\nSen. Michael Bennet (D-CO)\n\nBennet supports \u201censhrining Roe v. Wade into federal statute, preempting states that try to interfere with women\u2019s health rights, repealing the Hyde Amendment, and standing up against other efforts to undermine access to necessary care,\u201d according to a campaign spokesperson.\n\n\u201cWomen\u2019s reproductive rights are under assault all over the United States. Women\u2019s health care is under assault all over the United States,\u201d he said during a CNN town hall earlier this year. Bennet has also said he would only appoint judges that back Roe.\n\nMike Gravel\n\nFormer Alaska Sen. Gravel, a candidate who\u2019s notably in the race in order to prompt debate, has an expansive and unique abortion rights agenda. Gravel\u2019s landmark provision would tie an individual\u2019s ability to become a specialized physician with a commitment to providing abortions.\n\n\u201cOur signature point on abortion access is mandating the ability and willingness to provide an abortion as a condition of obstetrician licensing,\u201d according to a campaign spokesperson. \u201cIn addition, we support a constitutional amendment guaranteeing a right to an abortion, as well as lawmaking through the People\u2019s legislature, a fourth branch of government that Mike Gravel supports setting up that would allow direct lawmaking by the American people.\u201d\n\nGravel also backs repealing Hyde and codifying Roe into law.\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg\n\nButtigieg supports repealing Hyde, codifying Roe into law, and appointing judicial nominees who would support Roe. \u201cThe mayor is pro-choice and trusts women to make their own health care decisions. He also recognizes the harm in having men legislate women\u2019s bodies,\u201d said a campaign spokesperson.\n\nButtigieg has previously called for more men to speak out about abortion. \u201cI think it\u2019s particularly important from a political stance for men to stand up,\u201d he said during a campaign event earlier this year, according to HuffPost.\n\nRep. Seth Moulton (D-MA)\n\nMoulton backs the repeal of the Hyde Amendment and enshrining Roe in federal law. He\u2019s said undoing Hyde ensures that all women have the funding they need for health care and compared it to the funding the military needs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of like saying, you know, I support the troops but don\u2019t want to pay them,\u201d Moulton said of Hyde in a CNN interview. \u201cThat\u2019s the analogy here, and I think it\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nMoulton has also said he will exclusively appoint judges that support Roe and added that he backs Harris\u2019s proposal to require DOJ review of certain state laws.\n\nMontana Gov. Steve Bullock\n\nBullock supports ending Hyde, codifying Roe, and strengthening Title X funding, which provides money for family planning and preventive health care clinics (though the domestic gag rule currently restricts it to institutions that do not provide abortions).\n\n\u201cAs governor, Bullock has stopped every single effort to restrict reproductive health care, and made Title X funding permanent so it would no longer be a political football,\u201d a campaign spokesperson said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not what I think, it\u2019s what does an individual woman need to do with her body and with her health care,\u201d Bullock recently told CNN.\n\nRep. Tim Ryan (D-OH)\n\nRyan supports codifying Roe and repealing Hyde. He had previously expressed opposition to abortion rights but explained in a 2015 editorial why he\u2019s changed his position.\n\n\u201cI came in as a Catholic school kid from northeast Ohio who didn\u2019t think a whole lot about the issue and went into Congress pro-life,\u201d Ryan told BuzzFeed. \u201cMy opinion changed that there should not be anyone from the federal government between a woman and her doctor.\u201d\n\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI)\n\nGabbard is supportive of abortion rights, according to a campaign spokesperson, and would back using federal money to provide abortions. Gabbard has previously been anti-abortion but has since changed her position.\n\nMiramar, Florida, Mayor Wayne Messam\n\nMessam supports codifying Roe and using federal money to provide abortion services. He emphasized, in an interview with WBUR, that he sees Roe as \u201csettled law.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think when a woman is faced with a tough decision to abort a pregnancy, it\u2019s tough enough by itself to have to make such a personal decision \u2014 a tough decision to make \u2014 and currently right now in our country this issue has been demagogued, and I think that primarily us men are making the decisions in the laws,\u201d he said.",
