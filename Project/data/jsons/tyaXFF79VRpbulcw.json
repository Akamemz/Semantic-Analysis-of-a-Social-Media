    "content_original": "ANALYSIS/OPINION:\n\nFor Americans, freedom of speech has always been among our most cherished freedoms. Why? Because free speech and a free press provide a guardrail for all of our other freedoms. Free speech keeps us informed and connected, and it lets us hold our government accountable. Our commitment to free speech is the envy and example of the world. Yet, each generation faces a renewed struggle to preserve that freedom. Today, we\u2019re seeing that struggle, especially in our government\u2019s attempts to censor the Internet.\n\nThe regulatory threats to Internet freedom in America are getting more serious. True, Congress finally shelved two highly controversial bills, the Stop Online Piracy Act and the Protect Intellectual Property Act, in 2012. More recently, Congress dropped the Cyber Information Sharing and Protection Act. Yet, already they are starting to work on similar legislation. The main intention behind each of these bills may be good \u2014 to protect against online piracy and cyberattacks \u2014 but they all give government far too much control over what can and cannot be said online, opening the door to greater restrictions. Censorship is not the way to fight piracy or protect against threats to security or privacy.\n\nFree speech is a fundamental American right. The First Amendment to the Constitution states, \u201cCongress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.\u201d This includes speaking or writing in public or private, in books, newspapers and certainly on the Internet. We have a duty to protect and preserve this freedom for ourselves and our children. This year, my organization, the Consumer Electronics Association, is co-sponsoring Free Speech Week. This week serves as a reminder to all of us about the importance of free speech.\n\nFirst Amendment protections also encourage innovation. As many innovations threaten existing business models, free speech ensures that government efforts to squelch innovation can and will be exposed by the press. Moreover, the First Amendment combined with other constitutional protections, such as due process, protect new businesses targeted by threatened old businesses.\n\nAn uncensored Internet is a critical indicator of a nation\u2019s commitment to free speech and a tool to keep that freedom alive. Sadly, around the world there are still many nations that do not enjoy free speech, and many governments jealously censor the Internet to make sure people aren\u2019t saying or reading anything considered dangerous or unacceptable. Unsurprisingly, North Korea, China and Iran are among the worst offenders in blocking their citizens\u2019 access to the Internet.\n\nStill, the problem of censoring the Internet is widespread around the world. According to a report released by the independent watchdog Freedom House, \u201cFreedom on the Net 2013,\u201d global Internet freedom has been in decline for the past three years. This isn\u2019t just the case in nations under authoritarian governments, either. America\u2019s rating worsened by five points this year, to 17 on a scale of zero to 100, with zero being completely free.\n\nKeeping America\u2019s Internet uncensored is vital to protect and perpetuate free speech. The Internet creates a platform for individuals to express themselves and say what\u2019s on their minds.

It should never be allowed to happen in America. If we want to hold on to our prized tradition of free speech, we have to ensure that our Internet remains uncensored and free. We have to speak out ourselves and teach others to do the same. As we celebrate Free Speech Week, let\u2019s remember that we have the right to free speech in America because we fought for it, and we must remain vigilant if we want to protect and keep it for future generations.\n\nGary Shapiro is president and CEO of the Consumer Electronics Association.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
