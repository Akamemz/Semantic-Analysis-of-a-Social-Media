    "content": "While the president himself also tends to describe China as primarily an economic threat , he oscillates between these two camps . Sometimes it seems as if he \u2019 s hunkering down in the trenches for a prolonged economic cold war , other times as if he \u2019 s prepared to call the whole thing off and resume being best friends with Xi if the two sides can strike a deal .\n\u201c I think we \u2019 re very close to doing something with China , but I don \u2019 t know that I want to do it , \u201d Trump told reporters on Thursday before leaving for Argentina . \u201c I \u2019 m open to making a deal . But frankly I like the deal that we have right now . \u201d\nOther White House officials have different priorities when it comes to China . National-Security Adviser John Bolton has ventured beyond the economic realm , arguing that the trade dispute is really \u201c a question of power \u201d because practices such as intellectual-property theft enhance China \u2019 s economic clout and thus its military clout . ( One of the main reasons Bolton supports withdrawing from a nuclear-arms-control treaty with Russia is that it restricts the United States \u2019 capacity to counter the Chinese nuclear arsenal . )\nMike Pence has gone further still . This fall in Washington , D.C. , with an air of Reagan admonishing Gorbachev at the Brandenburg Gate , the vice president took issue not just with Beijing \u2019 s predatory trade policies and military adventurism in the South and East China Seas , but also with everything from its meddling in U.S. politics to its \u201c Orwellian \u201d surveillance state and persecution of religious minorities . Even as he called for a new , mutually beneficial relationship with China , Pence hinted darkly at a future of all-encompassing economic , political , military , and ideological competition .\nChina , the vice president warned , seeks to revise the \u201c international order \u201d at the expense of the United States . \u201c A country that oppresses its own people rarely stops there , \u201d he observed . Pence then headed off to Asia , where he championed the United States \u2019 $ 60 billion answer to the billions of dollars in infrastructure loans and other investments that China is doling out around the world .\nThis multifaceted view of the threat from China , moreover , isn \u2019 t exclusive to the Trump administration or the Republican Party . On Thursday , in a foreign-policy address , Democratic Senator and possible 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren cast China \u2019 s \u201c combination of authoritarianism and corrupt capitalism \u201d as \u201c a fundamental threat to democracy \u201d and accused Beijing of undermining American workers and the \u201c global order . \u201d\nAmong the lessons of the pre\u2013Cold War period is that the repercussions of these policy debates endure long after the haphazard circumstances in which policy makers resolved them . The historian Robert Messer , for example , has documented serious proposals by State Department officials in 1945 and 1946 for the United States to share its atomic secrets with the Russians , support Soviet control over Eastern Europe , and collaborate with the Kremlin on establishing nonaligned \u201c buffer regimes \u201d in China , Germany , and Japan . The plans were all based on the assessment that the Soviet Union did not represent an existential , intractable threat to the United States .",
