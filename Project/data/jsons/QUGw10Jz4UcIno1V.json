And regardless where you fall on the political spectrum \u2014 and whether you are a citizen or a resident \u2014 the question must be asked, and answered truthfully.\n\nThere\u2019s a fear factor, though. There\u2019s a fear that asking about citizenship might create an \u201cundercount.\u201d\n\nWhat an undercount might undermine is how political rhetoric \u2014 not necessarily facts \u2014 underscore federal, state and local spending policies and programs.\n\nNow, let\u2019s be real. You can claim residency in a state or a city but live in another, as members of Congress do. You also can claim residency in a city or county to put your child in a school nearer your place of employment. You also can claim residency in a city to get tax breaks for employment or real estate.\n\nSeeking someone\u2019s citizenship status doesn\u2019t, by itself, determine whether someone is a resident of a state.\n\nConsider, too, that mainland U.S. cities and states open wide their arms when wicked hurricanes strike such U.S. territories as Puerto Rico and Guam.
