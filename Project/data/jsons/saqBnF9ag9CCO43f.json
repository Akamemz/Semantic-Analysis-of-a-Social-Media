Copy may not be in its final form .\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ : We turn now to look at billionaire Education Secretary Betsy DeVos , a longtime backer of charter schools and vouchers for private and religious schools . She has said she considers education a , quote , \u201c industry , \u201d and called the public school system a \u201c dead end. \u201d A recent study by Stanford University \u2019 s Center for Research on Education Outcomes , however , found that students attending for-profit charter schools have significantly lower academic gains than those attending nonprofit charters .\nAMY GOODMAN : DeVos is back in the news this month after she said she wanted to return the Education Department \u2019 s Office of Civil Rights , quote , \u201c to its role as a neutral , impartial , investigative agency , \u201d unquote . An official with the office came under fire last week after she said that most campus rape claims amount to two young people who are \u201c both drunk. \u201d Meanwhile , attorney generals in 18 states and the District of Columbia are suing DeVos and the Department of Education over a rule to protect student loan borrowers that was set to go into effect July 1st , until DeVos announced a \u201c reset \u201d of the rule , known as \u201c borrower defense to repayment . \u201d\nTo discuss all this and more , we \u2019 re joined by Randi Weingarten , president of the American Federation of Teachers .\nIt \u2019 s good to have you with us . Can you assess , starting with today and the latest news , what \u2019 s happening in the Department of Education ?\nRANDI WEINGARTEN : Yes . It \u2019 s a disaster . I mean , it \u2019 s\u2014so , what we said\u2014so , we \u2019 ve spent a lot of time , as we just talked about before , in Michigan . And we watched Betsy DeVos when she was , you know , an advocate for privatization and charters and for busting up public schools in Michigan . And we said she was the most anti-education secretary who had ever gotten that position . And I think everything she \u2019 s done since then has proven that .\nSo this is what she \u2019 s doing . Number one , it \u2019 s not just promoting for-profit charters and vouchers , but it \u2019 s also taking a meat ax to the federal budget that goes to vulnerable kids , both in education and in healthcare . That \u2019 s number one . That \u2019 s part of the budget . Number two , she is cutting the enforcement . And number three , probably more important than anything , even though I think the budget cuts are really important , is that an agency that is supposed to be about equity , that is supposed to fight for the vulnerable , she is focused\u2014she is squarely on the side of lenders instead of borrowers . And you see that with the borrower defense rule you just talked about . She is squarely on the side of\u2014you know , of the powerful and not the vulnerable . So , she \u2019 s stripped away the transgender rules , the stuff that \u2019 s going on with campus violence and campus rape\u2014and what Candice Jackson said , saying , essentially , even though she apologized , that , you know , 90 percent of these cases are because somebody is drunk . And now the entity that is supposed to be there to protect against discrimination , protect and ensure that people have a shot at education , she \u2019 s saying , is now going to be neutral .\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ : And , Randi , the importance of her hiring as one of her deputy assistant secretaries Adam Kissel , who comes out of the Koch Foundation\u2014\nRANDI WEINGARTEN : Well , this is what\u2014it \u2019 s not just the fox guarding the hen house . This is an active , active undermining of the equity and discrimination rules that were embedded since Johnson in terms of the Department of Education . So it \u2019 s cutting the money for public schools . It \u2019 s preferring lenders over\u2014and for-profit colleges over students . And now it is actively undermining what OCR , the Office of Civil Rights , is supposed to do for the vulnerable .\nLet me add one more thing , because the healthcare bill comes into this , as well .\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ : Yeah , wanted to ask you about that . Yes .\nRANDI WEINGARTEN : Seventy-eight percent of school districts in America use Medicaid . Seventy-eight percent . So if you\u2014if you take the healthcare bill , that basically takes a huge whack out of Medicare , ends Medicare as we know it , that then hugely hurts every child in these 78 percent of districts\u2014wheelchairs , feeding tubes , the screening and these kinds of things . So , this is taking a whack out of the most vulnerable , taking away funding from those who\u2014from people who are poor , who need opportunity , like after-school programs and things like that , and then , on top of it , basically , not just undermining the enforcement , but basically saying , \u201c We are no longer going to be the agency that makes sure that there \u2019 s no discrimination for America \u2019 s schoolchildren . \u201d\nAMY GOODMAN : Explain this latest news on OCR , the Office of Civil Rights . Explain the implications of this .\nRANDI WEINGARTEN : So , what\u2014since\u2014from the moment\u2014from all of the civil rights laws back to the 1960s , one of them was the education law . There was public access . There was voting . There was education . And part\u2014and what was created was the Office of Civil Rights . And so , there was a presumption that that office was going to fight against discrimination and fight for equity . This was not just something that Barack Obama did . This goes back to every president , Republican and Democrat alike . And so , when she says she \u2019 s going to make that agency neutral , she is taking a step away from the enforcement of civil rights laws .\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ : Neutral between the perpetrators of discrimination and the victims of discrimination .\nRANDI WEINGARTEN : I mean , how do you make\u2014how do you make a law that\u2014where\u2014you know , look , I represent a union . I represent people . I believe people should have due process . And I believe there are false accusations . But , frankly , as a survivor , as a rape survivor , how do you not create some kind of climate to actually help people tell their stories and get redress ? And it \u2019 s not just on\u2014you know , it \u2019 s not just in terms of Title IX , but it \u2019 s every other law . I mean , think about what happened after Brown v. Board of Education . Think about how the so-called choice movement was used by segregationists to stop people from having\u2014stop black and brown kids from having opportunity . So , the OCR , that entity , is the one that people go to in order to enforce discrimination laws .\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ : And what alternative is there at the state level to be able to beat back some of these things that are happening now\u2014\nJUAN GONZ\u00c1LEZ : \u2014at the level of the federal Department of Education ?\nRANDI WEINGARTEN : Look , the great thing is that 18\u2014you know , we went to\u2014we went to the attorney generals . It is fantastic that the attorney generals , 18 or 21 of them , are now , you know , suing to enforce the borrower defense law\u2014or , regulation . I mean , what this essentially means\u2014let me just\u2014because those are code words . What this essentially means is that Corinthian College went bankrupt . All these kids were left holding the bag , with the student debts . What the borrower defense law means\u2014or , rule means , is that just like Corinthian gets its debts discharged in bankruptcy , these kids should not be holding the bag . That \u2019 s what it means . So , the AGs are suing on that . And look , we\u2014thankfully , we were able , in a bipartisan way , to get the new federal law covering K-12 passed last year in the Congress . And even Lamar Alexander just said to Betsy DeVos , \u201c You \u2019 re misreading the law . \u201d\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to ask you about\u2014well , NPR is reporting Wayne Johnson will be the new head of Office of Federal Student Aid , after James Runcie abruptly resigned last month .\nAMY GOODMAN : This is according to the Department of Education . FSA is an agency responsible for administering $ 1.4 trillion in outstanding student loans from 42 million borrowers , plus aid programs for millions of college students . As not mentioned in the department \u2019 s press release and first reported by BuzzFeed , Johnson is currently the CEO of Reunion Financial Services Corporation , a private student loan company .\nRANDI WEINGARTEN : Right . I mean , this is\u2014I don \u2019 t think saying the fox guarding the hen house is enough to describe what is going on . You basically have people from an industry that bilked kids , that have had predatory practices , now running the student aid programs . And it \u2019 s just\u2014again , it is this preference , this out-and-out preference for the lenders , for the for-profit colleges , that we have fought for the last several years . Like , you can \u2019 t give worthless degrees and leave kids holding the bag with unsustainable debt . And basically , we are winding back the clock on this , as well as on rights .\nAMY GOODMAN : Well , Randi Weingarten , we want to thank you very much for being with us , president of the American Federation of Teachers , as we move on to other education news .",
