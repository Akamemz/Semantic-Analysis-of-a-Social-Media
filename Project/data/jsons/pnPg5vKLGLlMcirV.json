The F.B.I . \u201c had spent hundreds if not thousands of hours over the past year circling the former secretary , reading thousands of her emails and interviewing all those around her , \u201d writes Mr. Comey . According to the investigative material posted on the F.B.I. \u2019 s website , those interviews included over 40 current or former State Department employees , most of whom knew something about Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s email because they handled or were aware of a variety of operational tech issues over four years .\nSo , on Oct. 27 , the F.B.I . investigators were deeply knowledgeable about Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s email and could make highly informed judgments about what was found on Mr. Weiner \u2019 s laptop . Mr. Comey should have reasonably recognized that the chance of finding a smoking gun in the first three months when such evidence was wanting for the remaining 45 months \u2014 when the Clinton email system experienced such common tech issues as no connectivity , bad firewalls , phishing and power failures \u2014 was low at best . Because of those issues , State Department management , diplomatic security and tech staff members knew of Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s system and its inherent risks and repeatedly raised these issues with Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s immediate staff .
