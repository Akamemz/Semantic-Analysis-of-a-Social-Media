I do , in fact , and I will come to that topic only after recounting Johnson \u2019 s recent three-day official visit to Turkey , where a brutal clampdown by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan , in the wake of a failed coup attempt this summer , has virtually destroyed the rule of law . The Turkish government has closed publishers and newspapers , locked up thousands of military officers without hope of a fair trial , and stifled free expression . Yet weeks after 17 Turkish journalists were arrested on terror charges , the newly minted foreign secretary , a former journalist himself , departed for Ankara to shake hands with Erdogan in one of the most shameless and hypocritical acts since Mussolini visited the Pope .\nLet me explain . After much agonizing and calculation , this spring , Johnson opted to join the \u201c Leave \u201d campaign and become a leading voice in the movement \u2019 s quest to depart from the E.U . The decision seemed both motivated by political opportunism\u2014if Leave triumphed , after all , Johnson might succeed David Cameron as prime minister\u2014and unabashedly brazen . One of Johnson \u2019 s chief scare tactics involved evoking the threat of Turkey joining the E.U. , which would allow its 76 million citizens , the vast majority of whom are Muslim , freedom of movement across the European Union .
