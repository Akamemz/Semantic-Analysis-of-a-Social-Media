    "content": "Every senator knew that the four gun-control measures brought up post-Orlando were going down in a partisan duel on the Senate floor on Monday .\nSo Susan Collins , the moderate Republican from Maine , came armed for compromise .\nThere she stood in her pale yellow suit , easily visible and strategically positioned near a door where Republicans enter the chamber \u2013 but also not too far from the Democratic side . As the defeats piled up , she chatted with senators from both parties , handing them a one-page summary of an alternative measure from her folder .\nThis is classic Senator Collins , working her colleagues with calm persuasion , facts , and analysis , looking for common ground on one of the country \u2019 s most contentious issues . She is , say senators on both sides , a highly respected bridge-builder at a time when Washington is at a defining moment on divisive gun politics . \u201c One of the very best , \u201d says Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R ) of Tennessee .\n\u201c The main thing Susan Collins does is ... her homework , so when she \u2019 s talking for example about what to do about terrorists with guns , she \u2019 s usually the best informed senator in the room and everyone listens to her , \u201d he says . \u201c That helps her when she \u2019 s working across the aisle , and that helps her when she \u2019 s working in our caucus . \u201d\nOn Thursday , Senator Collins saw what she had achieved . In the face of a procedural effort to kill her `` no-fly , no-buy '' compromise , all Democrats present in the chamber , plus eight Republicans and an independent , voted to keep it alive .\nThat 's a bipartisan majority of 52 senators who supported her effort to prevent suspected terrorists from buying guns . But it fell eight votes short of the 60 it would need to go any further . That may well have been only six votes short , had Bernie Sanders ( I ) of Vermont and Dianne Feinstein ( D ) of California been present .\nIt also did not help her cause that a last-minute alternative offered by Sen. Ron Johnson ( R ) of Wisconsin , may well have siphoned votes away from her compromise . His effort was roundly defeated .\nIf any gun measure had a chance in Congress , it was the Collins compromise , which prevents individuals on the \u201c no fly \u201d list and a related narrow list from buying firearms in a gun store . It alerts the FBI if anyone who has been in a much broader database over the past five years purchases a gun \u2013 a provision that would have pinged authorities in the case of the Orlando shooter , Omar Mateen .\nDespite the lack of a current path forward , Collins still called Thursday 's vote \u201c a good sign. \u201d Talking with reporters afterward , she said that \u201c this is the first time in a very long time that there has been a significant bipartisan vote on an issue that would limit access to guns to those who are on terrorist watch lists . \u201d\nShe was also encouraged by moderate Republicans who have expressed an interest in introducing companion legislation in the House . That \u2019 s another \u201c real sign of progress , \u201d she said . \u201c People are eager to come up with a bipartisan approach to a real problem that does not compromise Second Amendment rights. \u201d On the other hand , she told reporters earlier that the 25-hour sit-in by House Democrats demanding a vote on gun legislation was not helpful because it ginned up partisanship .\nThe senior senator from Maine ranks as the most bipartisan member of the Senate , according to an index by the Lugar Center and George Washington University . She certainly earned that ranking in this latest effort .\nThe compromise is more narrowly targeted than Senate Democrats wanted , covering 109,000 people worldwide but only 2,700 Americans or legal residents . Still , she won over Democrats , who viewed it as a step in the right direction , and as leverage to move on to expanded background checks .\nCollins had a much harder sell in her own party . The measure \u2019 s process of appeal for individuals who may be wrongly on the lists was not judged robust enough for many Republicans . The powerful National Rifle Association came out against it as an unconstitutional denial of Second Amendment rights . On Thursday , 46 Republicans voted to kill the legislation .\nWhen addressing such criticisms , Collins simply echoes the majority view of Americans .\n\u201c This is common sense . It does not infringe upon the Second Amendment rights of Americans . All it does is say , that if you \u2019 re too dangerous to board an airplane , you \u2019 re too dangerous to buy a gun , \u201d Collins said on the floor just before Thursday \u2019 s procedural vote .\nIt \u2019 s a position that even hawkish Lindsey Graham ( R ) of South Carolina , one of 11 co-sponsors of the Collins compromise , can embrace \u2013 along with his AR-15 rifle . To the NRA , he said at a press conference on Tuesday , \u201c every right , whether speech or buying a weapon , or any other constitutional right , has boundaries on it . \u201d\nCollins and the junior senator from Maine , independent Angus King , who also co-sponsored the legislation , practice a pragmatism that caused a Democratic colleague to ask Sen. King : \u201c Is there something in the water in Maine that gives people common sense ? \u201d\nThe answer lies not in the water , but in a political tradition that has had a significant influence on Collins .\nShe grew up in the town of Caribou , in the northeastern tip of Maine , not far from the Canadian border . Her family runs a lumber business founded by her ancestors in 1844 , and five generations on her father \u2019 s side served in the state legislature . Her father , too , was in the state senate and both of her parents served as mayor of Caribou .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a tradition and history of independence \u201d among Maine \u2019 s senators in Washington , and Collins and Senator King \u2013 a former governor \u2013 reflect that , says former Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe , a moderate Mainer who left the Senate in 2013 because of the hyper-partisanship and dysfunction . \u201c We \u2019 re a very practical people . \u201d\nSenator Snowe lists her independent-minded predecessors : Democrat George Mitchell , who helped broker peace in Northern Ireland ; Sen. William Cohen , who as a House member , became one of the first Republicans to break ranks and demand the impeachment of President Nixon during the Watergate crisis ( Collins was interning for him at the time and went on to work for him ) ; Democrat Ed Muskie , former governor , senator , and secretary of State .\nBut it was Republican Margaret Chase Smith , the first woman to serve in both the US House and Senate \u2013 and to represent Maine on Capitol Hill \u2013 who set Collins on her journey to the Senate .\nCollins was just 18 years old , a senior at Caribou High School , when she had the opportunity to meet Smith in her private Washington office as part of a youth Senate program .\n\u201c I arrived at Senator Smith \u2019 s office a bit breathless about meeting her , \u201d Collins recounts in a book about Senate women , \u201c Nine and Counting , \u201d published in 2000 ( 20 women currently serve in the Senate ) . To the student \u2019 s great surprise , Smith spent nearly two hours with her , answering Collins \u2019 s many questions . \u201c But what I most remember , was her urging me always to stand tall for what I believed in . \u201d\nSmith described to Collins her famous \u201c Declaration of Conscience \u201d speech , in which she denounced McCarthyism on the Senate floor .\n\u201c I remember being so proud that Margaret Chase Smith was my senator , \u201d recalled Collins , who hung a signed copy of Smith \u2019 s creed of public service in her personal office when she became a senator herself .\nAn independent streak runs through Collins , too . While she often votes with her party on national security and sometimes on fiscal issues , she has parted ways on gay rights , campaign-finance reform , and man-made climate change , among many other issues .\nThe NRA graded her at C+ in 2012 . Similarly , the anti-tax group Club for Growth gave her a 37 percent lifetime score in 2013 \u2013 the lowest of any Republican senator . Yet in 2014 , she soared to reelection for a fourth term , her constituents rewarding a conscientious legislator who last year cast her 6,000th consecutive vote .\n\u201c I admire that she \u2019 s not afraid to buck either party , and put the American people first to get things done , \u201d says Sen. Kelly Ayotte ( R ) of New Hampshire , a former state attorney general who played a key role in writing the due process part of Collins compromise .\nIt \u2019 s that independence that gives Collins the leverage to make deals and pass legislation \u2013 along with her legendary command of the facts and her gracious yet forthright manner . In the Senate , where anything of major importance requires 60 votes to pass , Collins , with the help of just a few others , can sometimes tip things one way or the other .\nIn 2009 , Collins was one of only three Republicans to vote for the stimulus package to rescue an economy in free fall . She wanted for Maine the jobs the package promised , but she and her colleagues \u2013 including Senator Snowe \u2013 were not happy with the price tag , which at one point neared $ 900 billion . It got whittled down to $ 787 billion .\nIn 2004 , she worked with Joe Lieberman , the Connecticut Democrat-turned-independent , to reorganize American intelligence after 9/11 , creating a new counterterrorism center and the office of the director of national intelligence .\nOn the other hand , when President Obama came courting her to support the Affordable Care Act , she gave him the cold shoulder . She \u2019 s no fan of \u201c Obamacare , \u201d and bristled at his overture to a few Republicans for a bill written largely by Democrats .\nStill , when GOP resistance to the healthcare law plunged the country into a partial government shutdown in October 2013 , she tried to find a bipartisan way out . It didn \u2019 t succeed , but it helped pave the way for an agreement that soon ended the crisis .\nOn the gun compromise , Richard Durbin ( D ) of Illinois , the Senate minority whip , backed the legislation . \u201c What is driving this more than anything is our respect for Susan Collins , \u201d said Sen. Durbin , who worked with the Mainer on the effort . \u201c The default mechanism is to give her a chance , \u201d said Durbin on Tuesday . The senator is responsible for rounding up Democratic votes .\nCollins vows to keep working on this issue . \u201c I never give up , \u201d she said after coming off the Senate floor . The shortfall shows a Congress in need of more people like Collins , often described as one of the last Republican moderates on the Hill , says former Republican Sen. Richard Lugar , a storied bridge-builder himself .\n\u201c I hope [ she \u2019 s ] not a dying breed , \u201d says the senator , who lost in the primaries to a tea party candidate in 2012 .\nThe reason his center and Georgetown University came up with their Bipartisan Index was to reverse \u201c the very disturbing trend \u201d of partisanship . Senator Lugar says the index is having some effect as members of Congress , responding to articles in their hometown papers , approach him on how to improve their rankings .\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox . By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy\nThe answer is simple , he says . Offer legislation with bipartisan co-sponsors , or try to co-sponsor legislation from the other party . The current gun debate is a case in point .\n\u201c Once again , this illustrates the importance of a leader like Susan Collins , who wasn \u2019 t willing to leave it \u201d at 0-4 on an issue of American safety , he says .\n\u201c This may not meet everybody \u2019 s measure , but the need to show responsiveness of our legislative body , to be active at a time of national peril , is very , very important . \u201d",
