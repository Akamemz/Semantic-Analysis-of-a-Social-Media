And now it 's on course to be the nastiest \u2014 and in the current political environment , that 's a high bar to reach .\nIncumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown was expecting a tough challenge as he sought a second term , after a bitter battle against Republican Mike DeWine in 2006 .\nAnd he 's getting it from Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel , who proved himself a rising star to the GOP in 2010 because of his ability to deliver money and votes . But Mandel 's victorious campaign for treasurer two years ago was so unpleasant that a major newspaper endorsed a third-party candidate rather than Mandel or the incumbent .\nThe 34-year-old Mandel began his campaign against Brown this spring with positive ads highlighting his roots , his youth and his service as a Marine and in government . But the campaign quickly turned ugly as outside money poured into the race \u2014 on both sides , but tipping heavily toward Mandel and against Brown . Ads slammed Brown for his support of the Affordable Care Act , for President Obama 's environmental policies and for spending nearly four decades as a `` career politician . ''\nBrown , 59 , blasted back at Mandel for not attending meetings , for his hiring practices and for fundraising around the U.S. and even outside it .\nWhen the fact-checkers started weighing in , Mandel ended up with some very poor scores . Brown got a few `` false '' ratings from PolitiFact , and one `` pants on fire '' \u2014 its worst rating .\nMandel has collected the `` pants on fire '' rating six times . One of Mandel 's ads got three separate `` pants on fire '' or `` false '' rulings alone , and the Brown campaign has launched a website labeling Mandel a liar .\nThe allegations do n't seem to bother Mandel . In an interview with me in April , Mandel said he has `` facts , and if a biased media organization wants to disagree with those facts , that 's their prerogative .
