Mr. McGahn began an effort to stop the letter or at least pare it back .\nLater that day , Mr. McGahn gave Mr. Miller a marked-up copy of the letter , highlighting several sections that he believed needed to be removed .\nMr. McGahn met again that same day with Mr. Trump and told him that if he fired Mr. Comey , the Russia investigation would not go away . Mr. Trump told him , according to senior administration officials , that he understood that firing the F.B.I . director might extend the Russia investigation , but that he wanted to do it anyway .\nMr. McGahn arranged for the president to meet in the Oval Office that day with Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Mr. Rosenstein , who he knew had been pursuing separate efforts to fire Mr. Comey . The two men were particularly angry about testimony Mr. Comey had given to the Senate Judiciary Committee the previous week , when he said \u201c it makes me mildly nauseous \u201d to think his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation might have had an impact on the 2016 election .\nMr. Comey \u2019 s conduct during the hearing added to concerns of Mr . Sessions and Mr. Rosenstein that the F.B.I . director had botched the rollout of the Clinton investigation and had overstepped the boundaries of his job . Shortly after that hearing , Mr. Rosenstein expressed his concerns about Mr. Comey to a White House lawyer , who relayed details of the conversation to his bosses at the White House .\nDuring the May 8 Oval Office meeting with Mr. Trump , Mr. Rosenstein was given a copy of the original letter and agreed to write a separate memo for Mr. Trump about why Mr. Comey should be fired .\nMr. Rosenstein \u2019 s memo arrived at the White House the next day . The lengthy diatribe Mr. Miller had written had been replaced by a simpler rationale \u2014 that Mr. Comey should be dismissed because of his handling of the Clinton email investigation .
