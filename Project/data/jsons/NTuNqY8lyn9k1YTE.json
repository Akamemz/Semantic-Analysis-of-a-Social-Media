As a result of which , the people who got a tax cut got a tax cut right then , their paychecks getting a little bigger as Uncle Stupid skimmed off a little less .\nAt the end of the year , people who had had less money withheld in taxes faced a terrible new reality : They had had less money withheld in taxes ! They owed less , and they paid less , and , because the government did a surprisingly effective job of matching up what was withheld to what was owed , taxpayers got smaller returns . Which is to say , they got their money right away rather than having to wait for a tax refund after making the government an interest-free loan .\nGetting paid , more or less in full , right now instead of waiting months and months : Naturally , taxpayers are enraged .\nAnd along comes Senator Harris .
