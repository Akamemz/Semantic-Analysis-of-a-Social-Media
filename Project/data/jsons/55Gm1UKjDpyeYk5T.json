    "content": "On Friday , Hugh Hewitt asked CNN anchor Candy Crowley about her infamous fact-check heard 'round the world during the `` town hall style '' presidential debate at Hofstra University . Her general self-assessment ? The journalistic equivalent of a solid B-plus :\nHH : I have to begin by asking you about the debate , obviously , since it \u2019 s the first time I \u2019 ve talked to you since then . Looking back at not just your role but the media generally , are you happy with how it turned out ? Is it pride , misgivings or both ?\nCC : Oh , no . I thought in the series of debates that you saw , whether it was Jim Lehrer or Bob Schieffer , Martha Raddatz or myself , that what you saw was a reflection of the styles of the four people , and you got a really good idea as to who these candidates were . So I \u2019 m good with it . I do think that the compilation and the , you know , what the Commission wanted to do was kind of have one debate build on another . I think they accomplished that , and I think more than that , because it \u2019 s not about the Debate Commission , it \u2019 s about the voters . I think they got a good view of these men under varying circumstances .\nHH : Now there was some pretty ferocious criticism directed at you , Candy . Here \u2019 s Joe Scarborough on MSNBC .\nJS : What I don \u2019 t understand is that Susan Rice said this five days in , the President , remember the President at the debate saying you know , and Candy Crowley for some reason basically making up history on the run\u2026\nHH : Then AEI \u2019 s Stan Veuger called it \u201c an outrageous intervention \u201d in which you \u201c shamelessly provided cover for the President \u2019 s lies \u201d , and then following , Charles Krauthammer on Fox said this .\nCK : We got Candy Crowley \u2019 s intervention , which was essentially incorrect , supporting Obama on the transcript . He did not call it a terror incident . There was a big opening that was missed , and I think it was contaminated by the actions of the moderator .\nHH : Now what do you think about this , Candy ? I \u2019 ve been defending you for years as one of the best in the business . But you get all of these conservative critics of how the debate went . How do you react to it ?\nCC : You know , I , look , in the sense that this is a free country , there \u2019 s certainly , anybody is willing , anybody certainly has the ability to criticize , the freedom to criticize . I think if you go back and look at that Rose Garden statement , remember we were talking about one specific thing \u2013 what happened in the Rose Garden . I stand by it . Do I understand that conservatives thought this was a missed opportunity ? I \u2019 ll tell you , the only thing I objected to all along was the idea that there was a motivating force to somehow support the President or somehow undermine Mitt Romney . And I can , it is one thing that actually I don \u2019 t like about politics anymore is that everyone \u2019 s always looking at everybody else \u2019 s motivation and can \u2019 t possibly know . So I think the motivation stuff bothers me , but certainly , you know , criticism is part of the game .\nImmediately after the debate , Crowley admitted that Romney 's broad point was correct , but her real-time intervention in front of 65 million viewers made it seem as though Obama 's misleading characterization was accurate . If conservatives want to point that out , she shrugs , it 's `` a free country . '' Later in the discussion , Hugh asked if she might have approached the exchange differently if she 'd seen excerpts of the president 's September 12 interview with 60 minutes , a crucial portion of which CBS News mysteriously suppressed for weeks :\nHH : Now Candy , would you have interjected the same way if you had seen that 60 Minutes excerpt before the debate ?\nCC : Had I seen it before the debate , you know what , Hugh , no . But let \u2019 s again remember that this was about what he said in the Rose Garden . And what he said in the Rose Garden , this was the day after the September 11th attack . He was referring to the attack , and he was talking about the attack in Benghazi . That \u2019 s why he was in the Rose Garden . He went on to talk about 9/11 , and then he said these acts of terror , blah , blah , blah , and today we mourn , he mentions those folks that were murdered in Libya . So we were talking about that specific moment in that specific Rose Garden .\nA laudable moment of self-reflection and honesty , followed by more dissembling . The fact is that Obama did not specifically refer to Benghazi as a terrorist attack in the Rose Garden , a point with which he concurred when the CBS News interviewer pointed out that the White House was conspicuously downplaying the terrorism angle . ( That interview occurred on the same day as the president 's Rose Garden statement ) . That was the crux of Romney 's point . Hugh also pressed Crowley on why she cut Romney off during his answer on Fast & Furious , and asked whether she believes the White House still has a lot of explaining to do on Benghazi ( Answer : yes ) . On the whole , I agree with Crowley 's bottom-line conclusion that the debate she moderated did not change the outcome of the election , but it certainly impacted certain dynamics . For instance , Romney seemed to shy away from Benghazi criticism after that second debate , barely even touching the topic during the candidates ' final meeting . Maybe he was a little spooked by Crowley 's commentary on behalf of the president . More likely , he was intentionally avoiding a confrontation , based on a misplaced sense that he was winning -- thanks to flawed internal polling . So the Hewitt/Crowley discussion is less about assigning blame for the result of an election , and more of an interesting glimpse into how the media sees its role and judges its own performance .",
