    "content": "The rollout of ObamaCare has been plagued by problems these past two weeks , as thousands complained they couldn \u2019 t sign up for coverage due to a deeply defective website .\nBut this process could have been easier if a nine-year , government-backed effort to set up a system of electronic medical records had gotten off the ground . Instead of setting up their medical ID for the first time , would-be customers would have their records already on file .\nUnfortunately for patients -- and taxpayers -- the long-running project has produced tangibly few results despite costing the government , so far , at least $ 30 billion .\nUnder a George W. Bush-era executive order , all Americans should have access to their medical records by the end of 2014 , part of a concept referred to as e-health . President Obama then made electronic medical records ( EMRs ) central to the success of the Affordable Care Act\nHealth care IT providers were tasked with creating a system connecting patients , health care professionals , hospitals , laboratories and medical facilities . But despite being paid vast incentives by the government \u2019 s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ( CMS ) , they \u2019 ve dragged their feet .\nDoctors have so far received $ 14 billion in sweeteners , and hospitals have been handed more than $ 16 billion . Officials indicate that incentives could eventually reach $ 45 billion , though there is no universally integrated system anywhere in sight .\nThe system , if and when it is operational , could prove invaluable in an emergency . Consider a person being rushed to the ER , with the hospital having no knowledge of the individual apart from the name on their driver \u2019 s license . The medical records system would immediately produce that individual 's private medical history , helping doctors determine treatment right away .\nDoctors , practitioners and hospitals , though , have been enriching themselves with the incentives to install electronic medical records systems that are either not inter-operable or highly limited in their crossover with other providers .\n\u201c The electronic medical records system has been funded to hospitals at more than $ 1 billion per month . Apparently little or none of that money went to the enrollment process which is where the bottle neck for signing up to ObamaCare \u2019 s insurance exchanges appears to be , \u201d Robert Lorsch , a Los Angeles-based IT entrepreneur and chief executive of online medical records provider MMRGlobal , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nSpecified medical practitioners are eligible to receive up to $ 44,000 via the Medicare EHR Incentive Program and up to $ 63,750 through the Medicaid EHR Incentive Program .\nAccording to the CMS website , as of August 2013 more than 320,000 health care providers received payments for participating in the incentive programs \u2013 more than half of all those eligible .\n\u201c The incentives [ for doctors and practitioners ] were designed to help small family practices because some of these record systems were getting very expensive , and they couldn \u2019 t afford it , \u201d a California-based former health care IT developer told \u2588\u2588\u2588 , speaking on condition of anonymity due their close relationship with some of the corporate incentive recipients . \u201c But there was a handsome windfall for those making decent money , \u201d she added . \u201c Why did all these other people get a windfall ? \u201d\nIn the case of hospitals , the incentives run into the many millions .
