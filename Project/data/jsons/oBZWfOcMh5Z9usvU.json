''\nUnder the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of the 1970s , the secret courts were set up to grant certain types of government requests -- wiretapping , data analysis and other monitoring of possible terrorists and spies operating in the United States .\nThe Patriot Act that Congress passed after the 9/11 attacks broadened the government 's ability to conduct anti-terrorism surveillance in the United States and abroad , eventually including the metadata collection .\nIn order to collect the information , the government has to demonstrate it is `` relevant '' to an international terrorism investigation .\nHowever , the 1978 FISA law lays out exactly what the special court must decide : `` A judge considering a petition to modify or set aside a nondisclosure order may grant such petition only if the judge finds that there is no reason to believe that disclosure may endanger the national security of the United States , interfere with a criminal , counterterrorism , or counterintelligence investigation , interfere with diplomatic relations , or endanger the life or physical safety of any person . ''\nIn defending the program , Gen. Keith Alexander , the NSA 's director , told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that `` 15 separate judges of the FISA Court have held on 35 occasions that Section 215 ( of the Patriot Act ) authorizes the collection of telephony metadata in bulk in support of counterterrorism investigations .
