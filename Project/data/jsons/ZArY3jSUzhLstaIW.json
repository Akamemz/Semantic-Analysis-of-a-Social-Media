    "content": "In an interview with conservative commentator Candace Owens , entertainment host Mario Lopez made a comment about parenting transgender children that outraged many . Later , Lopez called his comments `` ignorant and insensitive '' and vowed to `` be more informed and thoughtful . ''\nOwens , who hosts her own show on the PragerU YouTube channel , asked Lopez about what she called `` weird trends , '' in Hollywood . `` Celebrities are coming out \u2014 and I know Charlize Theron did this a few weeks ago \u2014 and saying that their child is picking their gender , '' Owens said .\nTheron recently revealed that her 7-year-old child Jackson did not identify as a boy . Owens said she 's trying to understand this `` new Hollywood mentality , '' where celebrity parents think their children have the `` mental authority '' to choose their gender .\nLopez agreed , and said he 's trying to understand it himself . `` I 'm blown away too , '' he said . `` I 'm never one to tell anyone how to parent their children ... if you come from a place of love , you ca n't go wrong . ''\n`` But , my God , if you 're 3 years old and you 're saying you 're feeling a certain way and you think you 're a boy or girl , I think it 's dangerous as a parent to make that determination then , '' he continued . Lopez said it 's `` alarming '' and there may be repercussions later on .\nOwens shared that as a child , she went through a `` tomboy '' phase for a year , before she went through puberty . Owens said if at that time she decided to shave her head and become a boy , she 'd be depressed once she went through puberty and started liking boys . `` You ca n't make a decision about your sexuality when you 're 3 years old , '' she said .\nLopez agreed . `` My daughter thinks some boys have cooties . You do n't know anything about sexuality , you 're just a kid , '' Lopez said .\nGender and sexuality are two separate aspects of a person 's identity . Gender refers to a person 's identity as male , female , a continuum or blend of both , or perhaps conforming to neither . Sex refers to a person 's biological makeup , while sexual orientation is about who they are attracted to . Experts say transgender individuals do not `` choose '' their gender or sexuality .\nThe two hosts continuously confused gender and sexuality during their discussion .\n`` I think that 's a very scary trend we 're seeing in Hollywood right now , and to me , at the core of it , seems like narcissism , '' Owens said . `` Like you just want to say , ' I 'm so tolerant , and I 'm so accepting that whatever my kid wants to do they can do . ' ''\nLopez , a father of three , said parents need to let their kids be kids , `` but at the same time , we need to be the adults in the situation . ''\n`` I think in the formative years is when you start to have these conversations and make those decisions [ about gender/sexuality ] . Before that is way to young , '' he continued .\nLopez , who at the beginning of the 40-minute interview said he is a registered independent after Owens insinuated he was politically conservative , said he does n't talk about politics , because he 's `` in the people business . ''\n`` I do n't want to alienate anyone . I want everyone to want to watch me , '' Lopez said . However , his comments about transgender youth drew criticism from Twitter users , some of whom said he 's `` cancelled '' as far as they 're concerned .\nGood luck getting work now Mario .
