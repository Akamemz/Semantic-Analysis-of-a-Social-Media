Its release had been delayed , but Trump agreed to send it to Ukraine this month , facing pressure from Congress . That money has the president \u2019 s critics concerned he withheld the aid in an attempt to convince his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate Biden .\nBiden is a leading frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination and damaging information could hurt his candidacy . There is absolutely no evidence he was involved in his son \u2019 s business dealings in Ukraine , nor is there evidence that he did anything illegal , despite President Trump \u2019 s suggestions otherwise . Biden has called for a transcript of the phone call to be released , saying in a statement that the alleged behavior is evidence \u201c there is truly no bottom to President Trump \u2019 s willingness to abuse his power and abase his country . \u201d\nTrump signaled he is open to doing so Sunday in Houston , Texas , telling reporters \u201c it would be fine \u201d to release the transcript ; he also said he might \u201c give it to a respected source , they can look at it , \u201d but did not specify whether he meant a news source he sees as credible or to someone within the government . He again stood by his words , however , saying of the transcript , \u201c what I said was so good ... everybody will say that . \u201d\nAs Republicans defend Trump , some Democrats are calling for impeachment\nDemocrats aren \u2019 t so sure that what the president said was \u201c so good. \u201d Many are concerned he may have attempted to use his office to have a foreign country interfere in the 2020 election by providing some sort of opposition research in exchange for aid . And as reports and details about that complaint have emerged over the last week , many Democrats have begun calling for consequences , up to and including impeachment .\nImpeachment \u201c may be the only remedy , \u201d Rep. Adam Schiff ( D-CA ) , who chairs the House Intelligence Committee and has not previously come out in support of impeachment , said on CNN \u2019 s State of the Union on Sunday .\nSchiff is a key figure in concerns about the president \u2019 s actions on the call : He is the person who called for the release of the whistleblower report after Acting Director of National Intelligence Maguire failed to disclose it to Congress , as required by law , and his committee will investigate the allegations the president faces .\nIf the whistleblower complaint is accurate it \u201c would be , I think , the most profound violation of the presidential oath of office , certainly during this presidency , which says a lot , \u201d Schiff added .\nOn NBC \u2019 s Meet the Press , Sen. Chris Murphy ( D-CA ) agreed that Congress had to take the allegation seriously .\n\u201c If we do have the evidence from this whistleblower that the president indeed did try to bully a foreign power into affecting our elections , then we have to do something about it , \u201d he said .\nSome Democratic presidential candidates , like Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro , argue that what Democrats should do is to begin impeachment proceedings . Biden has not joined these calls , despite his prominence within the whole affair \u2014 instead , he has said Trump must be investigated .\nBiden \u2019 s response is in line with that of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , who came out against the idea of impeachment on Friday . On Sunday , she released a \u201c Dear Colleagues \u201d letter saying that she expected Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire to turn the full whistleblower complaint over to Congress , and called on Republicans to support the investigation into the matter .\n\u201c If the Administration persists in blocking this whistleblower from disclosing to Congress a serious possible breach of constitutional duties by the President , they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation , \u201d the letter reads in part .\nOn Twitter , Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez ( D-NY ) argued her fellow Democrats ought to take a tougher stance on the complaint , writing that the Democratic failure to coalesce around impeachment was worse than the behavior itself :\nAt this point , the bigger national scandal isn \u2019 t the president \u2019 s lawbreaking behavior - it is the Democratic Party \u2019 s refusal to impeach him for it . \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( @ AOC ) September 22 , 2019\nShe faced some criticism for that assessment , but defended her stance by saying , \u201c It is one thing for a sitting president to break the law .
