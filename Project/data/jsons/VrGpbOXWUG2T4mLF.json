As the minority , Democrats ca n't boycott him the way Senate Republicans did with Judge Merrick Garland , nominated by former President Obama . Instead they have tasked themselves with probing for weak spots in a nominee who for many legal observers has a close-to-spotless paper trail .\nOne line of inquiry that Democrats seem intent on pursuing concerns Gorsuch \u2019 s reputation as a staunch defender of religious liberty .\nHis broad interpretations of the rights and protections of religious believers \u2013 sometimes at the expense of large numbers of other citizens \u2013 have been a cornerstone of his jurisprudence during a decade serving on the US Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit .\n\u201c That he comes down on side of religious liberty , even when it significantly infringes on the autonomy and liberty interests of large numbers of people , I think that \u2019 s an interesting area worthy of further explanation , \u201d says Sen. Chris Coons ( D ) of Delaware , a member of the Judiciary Committee , in an exclusive interview with the Monitor .\nFor a country founded as a sanctuary for people fleeing religious persecution and marginalization around the world , \u201c I think [ those questions ] should be subject to special consideration , \u201d he adds . \u201c The balance of faith and freedom , the balance of free exercise rights and autonomy or self-determination rights , are pretty fundamental questions that go back to the foundation of our country . \u201d\nGorsuch has pushed the envelope on this question , not least in perhaps his most noteworthy case from the 10th Circuit : \u201c Hobby Lobby Stores , Inc. v. Sebelius . \u201d\nThe case involved a family-owned company based in Oklahoma City that claimed that a mandate in the Affordable Care Act to provide contraception to its 28,000 employees made it complicit in an act that violated its religious beliefs . The 10th Circuit , with Gorsuch in the majority , sided with the company , and the Supreme Court narrowly upheld the decision 5 to 4 .\nAlong two other judges in the majority , Gorsuch said that he would have gone even further , and that individual business owners under the mandate should be able to make similar claims .\n\u201c All of us face the problem of complicity .

But his jurisprudence on religious freedom has endeared Gorsuch to conservatives .\nMany conservatives also share Gorsuch \u2019 s view on public displays of religion , with the judge dissenting from majorities in the 10th Circuit on cases that struck down an Oklahoma county \u2019 s Ten Commandments display ( Gorsuch said the Commandments are not \u201c just religious \u201d and thus don \u2019 t violate the Constitution ) , and that ruled the Utah Highway Patrol couldn \u2019 t erect 12-foot crosses to memorialize fallen officers .
