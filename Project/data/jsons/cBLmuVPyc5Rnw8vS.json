ET Wednesday from Washington for Cuba .\nGross ' lawyer , Scott Gilbert , told CNN last month the years of confinement have taken their toll on his client . Gross has lost more than 100 pounds and is losing his teeth . His hips are so weak that he can barely walk and he has lost vision in one eye .

''\nThe three Cubans released as a part of the deal belonged the so-called Cuban Five , a quintet of Cuban intelligence officers convicted in 2001 for espionage .

While the more liberal travel restrictions wo n't allow for tourism , they will permit greater American travel to the island .\nSecretary of State John Kerry has also been instructed to review Cuba 's place on the State Sponsors of Terrorism list , potentially paving the the way a lift on certain economic and political sanctions .\nThe revised relationship between the U.S. and Cuba comes ahead of the March 2015 Summit of the Americas , where the island country is set to participate for the first time . In the past , Washington has vetoed Havana 's participation on the grounds it is not a democracy . This year , several countries have said they would not participate if Cuba was once again barred .\nWhile only Congress can formally overturn the five decades-long embargo , the White House has some authorities to liberalize trade and travel to the island .\nThe 1996 Helms-Burton Act , which enshrined the embargo into legislation , allows for the President to extend general or specific licenses through a presidential determination , which could be justified as providing support for the Cuban people or democratic change in Cuba . Both Presidents Clinton and Obama exercised such authority to ease certain provisions of the regulations implementing the Cuba sanctions program .\nIn an effort to boost the nascent Cuban private sector , the President will also allow expanded commercial sales and exports of goods and services to Cuba , particularly building materials for entrepreneurs and private residences , and allow greater business training , as well as permit greater communications hardware and services to go to the island .\nOther announced changes permit U.S. and Cuban banks to build relationships and travelers to use credit and debit cards . U.S. travelers will be allowed to import up to $ 400 worth of goods from Cuba , including $ 100 in alcohol and tobacco -- even Cuban cigars . Remittances by Americans to their families back in Cuba will also be increased to approximately $ 2,000 per quarter .\nOfficials stressed the moves were not being undertaken to prop up the Castro regime , but rather to encourage further reforms on the island .\n`` None of this is seen as a reward . All of this is seen as a way of promoting change in Cuba because everything we have done in the past has demonstrably failed , '' another senior administration official said . `` This is not the U.S. government saying Cuba has gotten so much better . It is still an authoritarian state and we still have profound differences with this government . ''\n`` But if we hope for change with Cuba , we must try for a different approach . And we believe that considerably more engagement with the Cuban people and the Cuban government is the way to do that , '' the official said , adding that the United States `` will not for a moment lessen our support for improvement in human rights . ''\nTo that end , Cuba has agreed to release 53 political prisoners from a list of names provided by the United States . At least one of the prisoners has already been released . Havana has also agreed to permit significant access by its citizens to the Internet and allow the International Committee of the Red Cross and United Nations human rights officials back on the island for the first time in years .\nTalks on a deal began between senior White House and Cuban officials last year and happened in fits and starts , officials said . The officials praised the role the Vatican played as guarantor of the process .\nOfficials would not reveal the name of the U.S. intelligence source , but officials said he was the individual who revealed to the U.S. the Wasp network , which included the Cuban Five .\n`` He was a very important hero , '' the U.S. official said .\nThe moves are far more sweeping than the last action Obama took toward Cuba in January 2011 , when he eased restrictions on travel to and from the island . Relations have been largely frozen since Gross ' conviction and the White House has made his release a condition of improved ties .\nIn 2013 , Obama drew praise from advocates of changing U.S. policy toward Cuba when he said the U.S. had to be `` creative '' and `` thoughtful '' about fostering change on the island .\n`` The notion that the same policies that we put in place in 1961 would somehow still be as effective as they are today , in the age of the Internet and Google and world travel , does n't make sense , '' Obama said at a November 2013 fundraiser in Florida . `` We have to continue to update our policies .
