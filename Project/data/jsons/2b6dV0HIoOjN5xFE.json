That is similar to July 2018 : 42 percent pro-life vs. 45 percent pro-choice .\nDemocrats ( 72 percent ) , women ( 52 percent ) , and voters under age 45 ( 53 percent ) are nearly equally as likely to be pro-choice as Republicans ( 71 percent ) , men ( 49 percent ) , and those over 45 ( 51 percent ) are to be pro-life . Independents are split , 42 percent pro-life vs. 43 percent pro-choice .\nAnd when asked about their familiarity with the most famous of abortion cases , Roe v. Wade , just under half ( 48 percent ) say they are \u201c extremely \u201d or \u201c very \u201d familiar with the ruling while the exact same number are \u201c somewhat \u201d or \u201c not at all \u201d familiar .\nMoreover , 57 percent of voters say the Supreme Court should let the 46-year old ruling stand ; that number jumps to 68 percent among those who are familiar with the case .\nMajorities of Democrats ( 73 percent ) , voters ages 45 and over ( 63 percent ) , women ( 59 percent ) , Catholics ( 59 percent ) , and men ( 54 percent ) all feel the case should be left alone . Even pluralities of Republicans ( 43 percent stand vs. 37 percent overturn ) and Protestants ( 49-29 percent ) would let the ruling stand .\nOn January 22 , New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed into law the Reproductive Health Act , which allows for abortions after 24 weeks if a woman \u2019 s health is at risk or if the fetus is not viable . Additionally , a law introduced in early January by a Democratic lawmaker in Virginia would have also loosened restrictions on late-term abortions , but the bill was set aside .\nSo how do voters feel about late-term abortions ? Voters take a more nuanced view about late-term abortions than the traditional pro-choice/pro-life divide . One-in-ten ( 11 percent ) think a woman \u2019 s right to have an abortion in the third trimester of pregnancy should \u201c always \u201d be legal , while 43 percent say \u201c only in some circumstances , \u201d and 37 percent say \u201c never . \u201d\nMajorities of Republicans ( 58 percent ) and white evangelical Christians ( 61 percent ) think late-term abortions should be wholly illegal .
