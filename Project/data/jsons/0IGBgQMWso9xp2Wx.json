If you like numbers and you know Silver \u2019 s track record in presidential elections , this should be something of a relief .\nSilver \u2019 s model gives Trump a 19 percent chance of winning the election . Right now he has Clinton taking the popular vote by seven points and absolutely crushing Trump in the Electoral College , 353 to 184 . Considering that the polarized electorate means each candidate is starting out with a floor of probably 50 million or so votes , these numbers indicate Trump is performing no better against Clinton than a rock covered in orange spray paint would . The GOP \u2019 s only chance might be to toss him overboard at the convention and nominate an inanimate carbon rod .\nIf nothing else , the reduction of this election to the numbers for each candidate reminds us that , for all the sturm und drang up to this point , this election is , like every other presidential election , a fight between two candidates and two competing visions . ( As much as Trump can be said to have any vision anyway . ) For anyone exhausted by the screaming and unpleasantness of this Democratic primary campaign , it is nice to now catch our breath beneath the solid foundation of math before the conventions and the official general election kick-off sprays us all with its stink . Because Trump \u2019 s ego isn \u2019 t going to take losing very well . And if the NRA \u2019 s new anti-Clinton ad is any indication , neither are the lunatics who have thrown their support behind him .\nBut if the poll numbers aren \u2019 t enough for you , there is the reaction to them by Trump dead-enders , who at this point are the equivalent of flight attendants passing out peanuts and ginger ale while oxygen masks are dropping from the ceiling , the pilot is openly sobbing over the intercom and both wings are on fire .\nFor example , Roy Edroso points us to this post over at the conservative blog Powerline , which contains this gem of a paragraph :\nOne thing is worth pointing out , however : even in this outlier poll , Trump holds a ten-point lead among white voters , 50 % -40 % ( down from 57 % -33 % in May ! ) . It is remarkable that even at his low ebb , Trump wins by a near landslide margin among white voters , a majority of the electorate . Not many years ago , that would have assured him of victory .\nIt is a bit early to be pulling out the \u201c Our candidate would have this election in the bag if we just allowed only white people to vote \u201d line .

For one thing , this is not true . Polls show Trump getting crushed in battleground states . For another , Lowry \u2019 s evidence for Trump \u2019 s \u201c remarkable \u201d effort is that Clinton has spent $ 140 million on ads in battleground states while Trump has spent \u2013 wait for it \u2013 nothing . Literally , he has spent less on ads in battleground states than I spent on lunch on Wednesday .\nWhat Lowry misses is that the $ 140 million is mostly \u201c reserved time \u201d in the future . Clinton spent $ 26 million running battleground state ads in June . The remaining $ 114 million has been spent on airtime for ads that will run in the future . In other words , Trump \u2019 s numbers are already sinking and the Clinton campaign has yet to unleash a good 80 percent of its ad buy to date .\nOf course , Silver has been wrong before , mostly because he didn \u2019 t want to believe his own polling model .
