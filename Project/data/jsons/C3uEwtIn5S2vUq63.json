Via WaPo , gray lines are unfavorable : pic.twitter.com/VukZbrNJpc \u2014 Guy Benson ( @ guypbenson ) March 31 , 2016\nNo April foolin ' , this is a very real poll published earlier in the week by Pew Research . It comes to us via Allahpundit , who wonders how this could possibly be the case , given the public 's understandably heightened anxieties about national security in the wake of three ISIS massacres in Western cities . The answer , my friends , is obvious . We 'll get to it soon enough , but first , here are the raw numbers . Note the trend line : The public was split evenly on the question of constructing a fence along the entire Southern border back in 2011 . Four years later ? Same deal . Then fast forward just six months , with terrorism fears on the rise , so much so that a super-majority of American voters -- including a slight majority of Democrats -- say they 'd be okay with employing occasional , targeted torture ( yes , the question wording uses that loaded term ) against captured jihadists . You 'd think that support for the border wall , which can easily be cast as a national security precaution , would 've ticked up . You 'd be wrong . Instead , Pew has measures an 18-point net swing against the idea . What happened ? Donald J. Trump is what happened . After the summer of 2015 when his candidacy was still widely viewed as a dead-end joke , Americans slowly but surely began to take the possibility of a Trump presidency seriously . As that has happened , his favorability among key groups has fallen , with his overall favorability rating remaining steadily terrible and deteriorating badly over the last month . What we 're seeing is that not only does Trump 's historic unpopularity render him personally toxic as a potential Republican nominee , it also gravely endangers the GOP 's modest Senate majority , and puts more red-held House seats in play than previously imagined . Beyond that , it also appears to 'toxify ' issue stances with which voters most closely associate Trump ; `` build the wall '' is the clearest top-of-mind example of this phenomenon . Basically , `` if Trump 's for it , I 'm not . '' Sure , that 's just as maddeningly anti-intellectual and reactionary as the mentality displayed every day by Trump 's cult of personality , but it 's reality . And if you think I 'm trying to shoehorn these polling results into my `` Trump hatred '' narrative , please feel free to present a plausible alternative theory for why public opinion has shifted so dramatically and in such short order , especially when world events would suggest political winds ought to be blowing the opposite direction . I 'll wait.This theory underscores one of the biggest problems many anti-Trump conservatives have with the notion of him as the Republican Party 's standard-bearer . Even when he is correct on an issue , his mere connection to that position in voters ' minds risks eroding support for the types of policies he ostensibly believes in . Unlike leading Democrats , the vast majority of conservatives favor enhanced border security , even as most Republican voters continue to favor a path to legal status for non-criminal illegal immigrants already in the country . By slapping a `` Make America Great Again '' bumper sticker on the concept of border security , Trump has made his signature policy objective much less popular among Americans . ( An example that cuts against this concept is increased backing for Trump 's temporary 'Muslim ban ' proposal , which speaks to an immediate public fear , and may be less overtly Trump-branded than The Wall ) . Pro-lifers fear a similar fallout from Trump 's recent abortion debacle , which handed the Left a brutal soundbyte that ca n't be undone by his frantic reversal statement . Many on the Right are also worried that Trump 's support for government healthcare , tax increases , and opposition to entitlement reform is actively harming years of public relations progress that conservatives have painstakingly advanced . He 's a bull in a China shop . A wrecking ball . And he 's willing to sacrifice anything in order to pad his ego in the moment , settle petty scores , or win a fleeting news cycle . The Pew survey also finds majorities of Cruz and Kasich supporters predicting that Trump would be a `` poor '' or `` terrible '' president , with fully 56 percent of Republican voters expecting a Trump candidacy would divide the party , not unify it ( much worse than McCain or Romney 's standing on this question around the spring of their respective election years ) . That 's what Republicans are saying . What about everyone else ? Yikes : As a point of reference , Mitt Romney won white women outright . Trump seems ... unlikely to replicate that feat , which would be devastating given his historically heavy reliance on white voters to have any chance of winning a general . As you can see , the same WaPo data set shows Trump 's unfavorability sitting at 51 percent ( ! ) among white men , his best demographic . Best of all for Hillary Clinton , historical data shows that head-to-head general election starts to become predictive around April of an election year . Welcome to April , friends . Hillary 's up by 11 points . There 's still time to avoid this catastrophe . To that end , I 'll leave you with the second poll this week showing Cruz leading Trump by ten points in Wisconsin : A decisive loss in Wisconsin would narrow Trump 's path to 1,237 delegates considerably -- particularly if he ends up losing any delegates over his pledge shenanigans .",
