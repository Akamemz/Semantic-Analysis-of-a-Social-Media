    "content": "As Donald Trump demonstrated in his first address to Congress , no matter how loathsome a ruler may be , he can bring an assembly of politicians to its feet and disarm some critics simply by invoking the quasi-secular faith\u2014Americanism\u2014and eulogizing the latest uniformed war-state employee to sacrifice his life for it . Trump has indeed shown he can fill the job expected of any president : supreme head of what Andrew Bacevich calls the Church of America the Redeemer .\nHorace 's declaration `` Dulce et Decorum est Pro patria mori '' \u2014 '' It is sweet and proper to die for one 's country '' \u2014is just what poet Wilfred Owen called it : `` The old Lie . '' Screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky extended Owen 's point when he had his protagonist in The Americanization of Emily tell a war widow , `` We perpetuate war by exalting its sacrifices . '' How many times must people fall for this ploy before they realize they have been cruelly scammed ? ( The American Church is sustained by a coalition of profiteers and true believers or what economist Bruce Yandle generically dubbed `` bootleggers and Baptists . '' )\nIf we are ever to abolish America 's bloody and costly permanent war state we will have to rethink the quasi-secular faith which holds that dying\u2014and killing\u2014for one 's country is the greatest honor and virtue to which one one can aspire . It is time we learned that killing and dying for an ideology\u2014even so-called liberal democracy\u2014 is as bad as doing so for a religion , even so-called radical Islam . ( The distinction between ideology and religion is more apparent than real ) .\nIn his speech to Congress , Trump milked the moment for all it was worth when talking about a Navy SEAL who died in a bungled special-ops raid in Yemen in late January . ( Did you know the U.S. government conducts ground operations there ? ) It was the first such operation Trump approved , although it was planned during the Obama administration and Trump has shifted responsibility to the generals .\n`` We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens , the widow of a U.S. Navy Special Operator Senior Chief William 'Ryan ' Owens , '' Trump said before Congress . `` Ryan died as he lived : a warrior , and a hero\u2014battling against terrorism and securing our nation\u2026 . Ryan 's legacy is etched into eternity . Thank you . For as the Bible teaches us , 'There is no greater act of love than to lay down one 's life for one 's friends . ' Ryan laid down his life for his friends , for his country , and for our freedom . And we will never forget Ryan . ''\nEveryone stood and applauded for over two minutes , Trump making no effort to bring the ovation to an end . `` Ryan is looking down right now , '' he said . `` You know that . And he is very happy because I think he just broke a record . ''\nThat 's great . Carryn Owens lost her husband , his three children lost their father , but they 'll know that he died for the nation-state and that members of Congress stood for a record length of time .\nTrump also said : `` I just spoke to our great general [ and Defense Secretary James ] Mattis , just now , who reconfirmed that\u2014and I quote\u2014'Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies . ' ''\nOf course Trump left some things out of the account . The raid killed at least 25 noncombatants , including children \u2014 among them an American citizen : the 8-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki , the militant Muslim cleric and American citizen executed without due process in Yemen by an Obama drone nearly six years ago . Nora al-Awlaki 's teenage brother , Abdulrahman , also an American citizen , was similarly killed in an Obama drone strike in Yemen .\nMoreover , the special-ops raid in January failed in its mission to capture or kill leaders of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) . As NBC reported : contrary to Trump 's claim , `` last month 's deadly commando raid in Yemen , which cost the lives of a U.S. Navy SEAL and a number of children , has so far yielded no significant intelligence , U.S. officials told NBC News . '' ( A follow-up report found the same . CNN reports otherwise , and it 's certainly possible the raid netted intel . But we must also consider that military officials have a motive to lie : to reinforce the faith that Owens did not die in vain . )\nThe purpose of the raid has been clouded by conflicting statements . NBC says that initially `` Pentagon officials called it a 'site exploitation mission ' designed to gather intelligence '' but later did not dispute Sen. John McCain 's description of the mission as intended to eliminate or catch militants . Adding to the confusion is the Pentagon 's description of one of the victims , Sheikh Abdel-Raouf al-Dhahab , as an AQAP leader . NBC says `` the Yemeni government disagrees . ''\nThe Washington Post reported that `` Yemeni and tribal officials described a chaotic scene that followed [ the raid ] , saying that tribal leaders , even those without an affiliation with AQAP , took up arms out of loyalty to Dhahab and a desire to protect their village . 'Any person who has dignity and honor would not stand by and watch his neighbors and relatives and tribesmen being attacked and do nothing , ' said Saleh Hussein al-Aameri , a tribal leader who was close enough to hear the gunfire . '' ( Emphasis added . )\nApparently you do n't have to be a `` radical Islamic terrorist '' to resent foreign troops storming your village at night .\n`` Almost everything that could go wrong did , '' The New York Times reported . `` The death of Chief Petty Officer William Owens came after a chain of mishaps and misjudgments that plunged the elite commandos into a ferocious 50-minute firefight that also left three others wounded and a $ 75 million aircraft deliberately destroyed . '' Nevertheless , `` the Pentagon is drafting such plans to accelerate activities against the Qaeda branch in Yemen . ''\nAccording to the quasi-secular faith , reckless disregard for human life does n't matter . All that matters is that a man gave his life carrying out orders issued by the high priests of the American Church in the name of National Security . It is heresy even to wonder if the death was in vain , if the noncombatant deaths constitute war crimes , or if the operation bore any relation to the actual security of the American people . Woe betide anyone who suggests ( as some military people have ) that such raids create militants and fill the ranks of people who want revenge against Americans for what they allow their government to do .\nAs expected , the Trump administration deflected criticism by invoking Owens 's martyrdom . Trump press secretary Sean Spicer said that anyone `` who undermines the success of that raid owes an apology and [ does ] a disservice to the life of Chief Owens . ''\nInconveniently , it was Owens 's father who admonished Trump not `` to hide behind my son 's death to prevent an investigation '' of the ill-conceived operation . The elder Owens refused to meet the president when the chief petty officer 's remains came to Dover Air Force Base . `` My conscience would n't let me talk to him , '' the elder Owens , a veteran , said .\nThat Trump would exploit a grieving widow and invoke the national quasi-secular faith for his own advantage is hardly surprising . Presidents always do this . What 's remarkable is that even some of Trump 's critics were taken in . For example , Van Jones , who portrays himself as an edgy left radical , gushed over Trump 's shameful use of Owens 's death . Trump `` became president of the United States in that moment , period , '' Jones said on CNN . `` That was one of the most extraordinary moments you have ever seen in American politics . ''\nHardly . But it shows that a quasi-secular faith can be as powerful as any religious faith .\nContrary to the national faith , the `` war on terror '' is neither defensive and nor effective : there was no AQAP before the U.S. military invaded Afghanistan and Iraq roughly 15 years ago , and it has been bombing Yemen for years . ( Bizarrely , it also helps AQAP by enabling Saudi Arabia 's war against AQAP 's enemy , the Houthis . ) The 9/11 attacks , which provide the official excuse for the permanent war state , were acts of revenge \u2014 albeit immorally directed largely at noncombatants\u2014after decades of oppressive and lethal U.S. actions against Arab Muslims . The already small terrorist threat to Americans could be further reduced by adopting a non-interventionist foreign policy .\nBut any suggestion that the American Church does wrong is systematically marginalized and kept from the public by the mainstream media 's defenders of the official faith . As long as that 's the case , innocents in other lands will continue to be murdered and Americans like Ryan Owens will continue to die in vain .",
