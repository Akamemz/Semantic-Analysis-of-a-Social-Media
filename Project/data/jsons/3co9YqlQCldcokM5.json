Through the early days of the email revelations , and even throughout the summer as further discoveries turned up the heat , Clinton \u2019 s group sweated the minutiae of her carefully crafted responses in an attempt to keep the campaign \u2019 s preferred narrative on track .\nAs the scandal evolved during the summer of 2015 , aides suddenly had to combat reports that classified information may have been emailed , leading Clinton to eventually modify her original denials to say she had never \u201c sent nor received any email that was marked classified. \u201d On Aug. 21 , her team was debating a new statement addressing the issue . Press secretary Brian Fallon emailed communications director Jennifer Palmieri to flag a potential issue .\n\u201c This line \u2013 \u2018 \u200eThis process of looking backwards to see if something should have been classified at the time is fine \u2019 - is problematic , \u201d Fallon wrote . \u201c We should not think it is fine to find something that \u2018 should have been classified at the time. \u2019 Our position is that no such material exists , else it could be said she mishandled classified info . \u201d\nWorries such as Fallon \u2019 s , however , were not as commonplace during the early days of the scandal . Emails reveal that Clinton \u2019 s staff \u2019 s first instinct was to use humor to blunt the force of the March 2 New York Times article on the personal account .\nPalmieri floated the \u201c idea of HRC making a joke about the email situation \u201d during an event for Emily \u2019 s List , a pro-choice PAC . A few staffers chimed in that this approach could work , but adviser Mandy Grunwald disagreed .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t know what \u2019 s in the emails , so we are nervous about this , \u201d Grunwald wrote after a conversation with consultant Jim Margolis . \u201c Might get a big laugh tonight and regret it when content of emails is disclosed . \u201d\nNick Merrill , another press aide , pitched a comedy segment on March 7 , noting that Clinton could appear with her husband and daughter at an already-scheduled event being hosted by comedian Larry Wilmore . Merrill mused that Wilmore could cue Clinton to join him on stage with the line , \u201c I should tell you , I just emailed HRC ( I hear she \u2019 s a big emailer ) , and asked if she \u2019 d join as well . \u201d\n\u201c Goal would be to cauterize this just enough so it plays out over the weekend and dies in the short term , \u201d Merrill writes , adding : \u201c It might be crazy , but it might also be the one-two punch we need right now . \u201d\nClinton \u2019 s advisers also discussed how much \u2013 if any \u2013 blame should be assigned to her predecessors at the State Department .
