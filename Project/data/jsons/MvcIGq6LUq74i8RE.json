    "content": "Nobody is acknowledging it yet , but in all likelihood the next president , be it a Republican or a Democrat , will have just four years to get as much done as possible before passing the torch to the challenger in 2020 . Republicans have little hope of a two-term presidency ( let alone winning in 2016 ) due to changing demographics , and a narrative shift that favors acceptance and diversity over traditional values , and Southern dominance . There is a realignment occurring in the United States the likes of which we have not seen since the Solid South became solid red .\nDemocrats , however , should be concerned for a different reason . The last consecutive two-term presidents from the same party were James Madison and James Monroe , who were both Democratic-Republicans . That transition occurred before the formation of our modern two-party system .\nThe 2020 election is one Democrats can not afford to lose . It is a census year , which means the future of the House will be determined for the next decade . It is also highly possible that at least two ( or three ) seats will open on the Supreme Court , given the ages of the justices\u2014more than are likely to open between 2016 and 2020 . If the Democrats do not win , the GOP will have a solid hold on government for at least another 10 years .\nAnd that raises one very important question : Do Democratic voters really want to hitch their wagon to four years of a center-right candidate like Hillary Clinton ?\nThe Democratic Party as a whole is moving to the left\u2014albeit slowly . Elizabeth Warren would never have gotten elected in the '90s , let alone become as influential as she has . It can easily be said that the Democrats are no longer the party of the Clintons ( the New Democrats ) , and are instead , the party of Elizabeth Warren . If Hillary Clinton wins the nod in 2016 , and manages to win the general , it is unlikely she will be able to excite the base of her own party in four years\u2014as the DNC may slowly be realizing . She 's a hard enough sell now in spite of every effort chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has expended on her behalf . Many on the left will not turn out to vote for Clinton\u2014in fact , a new poll showed that 20 percent of Democrats would defect and vote Trump over Hillary in a general election .\nClinton 's problems start with image . More Americans mistrust her than trust her . This may be due to her various \u201c scandals , \u201d especially her private email server . But it probably also has something to do with the fact that she is politically expedient . A look at her campaign strategy throughout her career is telling . In this regard , she is nearly indistinguishable from the GOP . In 2008 , her campaign reportedly circulated a picture of Barack Obama dressed as a Somali elder without providing context for the image , in a seeming effort to stir fears that the now-president was a Muslim . In this current election cycle , Clinton has relied on Republican talking points to attack Bernie Sanders . Specifically , she cited Rupert Murdoch 's Wall Street Journal 's faulty analysis of the cost of his domestic plan . Clinton has gone as far as attacking him for proposing universal health care\u2014a move 2008 Hillary called out as a Republican tactic .\nClinton has also resorted to Republican talking points to justify opposing a $ 15 minimum wage . Though she calls them her greatest enemies , her argument relies on the same false premise as the GOP 's : it will cost jobs . First , Clinton purposefully ignores that a raise to $ 15 per hour would be gradual . Additionally , she pays no heed to the fact that evidence indicating such increases will cost jobs is thin . In fact , studies overwhelmingly suggest that minimum wage hikes have no impact on employment .\nAdditionally , many on the left worry that there is no way for Democrats to know what Hillary Clinton will morph into , given her numerous flip-flops . And for all of her talk about fighting for the middle class , she has an uncomfortably cozy relationship with Wall Street and powerful private industries ( oil , private prisons , big banks , cable companies , etc . ) .\nBut Clinton \u2019 s problems run much deeper than impressions of her character . As a candidate , Hillary is closer to George H.W . Bush or Ronald Reagan than to the heart of the Democratic Party , FDR . Progressives know this about her . She exists out-of-time\u2014propped up by a Democratic establishment similarly stuck on Third Way politics . Hillary is a New Democrat in 2016 ; she \u2019 s caught between two narratives : the GOP/Reagan narrative that government is too big , and inherently inefficient , and the Democratic narrative , that government can and should work for all to solve the problems we face as a country .\nClinton \u2019 s background creates a disconnect between her policies and those of her party .\nHillary 's \u201c strongest issue \u201d is foreign policy , given her years of experience at the State Department . Unfortunately , her foreign policy ideas don \u2019 t fit with many on the left . Put simply , she is an interventionist hawk . In 2008 Barack Obama compared her to George W. Bush , and that comparison still seems appropriate . She did , after all , vote for the Iraq War and support the use of torture on detainees . Although she has called her war vote \u201c a mistake , \u201d we must look at it in its proper context . When we consider the initiatives she pushed at the State Department ( the bombing of Libya , arming the Syrian rebels , and selling arms to Clinton Foundation donors ) , as well as her current plans , like the no-fly-zone in Syria , it seems less of a one-off , and more like part of a pattern .\nClinton 's strategy is to deal with ISIS is nearly indistinguishable from Marco Rubio 's : defeat ISIS rather than contain them by forming a coalition with our allies to take back territory , sending in ground troops , disrupting their recruitment , and ramping up airstrikes .\nHillary 's plan , like those of the Republicans , is predicated on the idea that by taking out ISIS , U.S. involvement in the region can end .\nWhat Clinton 's and the Republican plans fail to take into account is political culture . Changing political culture within a generation is impossible , let alone changing it in a part of the world Westerners , as a rule , barely understand ; where people mistrust and resent us , and where democratic tradition is a novel concept .\nThe Middle East and North Africa ( MENA ) is not the only part of the globe where intervention is Hillary \u2019 s modus operandi . Her involvement in legitimizing the violent coup regime in Honduras indicates that as president , interference would also define her Latin America policy .\nBesides intervention , Clinton \u2019 s foreign policy prioritizes `` free markets . '' She appears to view the world through the lens of how much multinational business , rather than domestic companies or workers , benefits . Though she has now flip-flopped on both the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) and the Trans Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) , her years of support for each suggest her shift is politically motivated .\nAll things considered , it is safe to call Clinton a neoconservative .\nEconomically speaking , in spite of touting herself as a \u201c progressive who likes to get things done , \u201d Clinton is essentially a moderate Republican\u2014which makes economic progressives angry . Her capital gains tax proposal does not increase long-term capital gains taxes , and instead targets short-term investments . This might sound solid on paper , but , as I 've said before , it will impact new investors and the middle class , while preserving the status quo where billionaires , who keep the majority of their assets wrapped up in long term investments , pay lower rates than their secretaries . She is also against reinstating Glass-Steagall , and breaking up the banks\u2014instead opting for a game of regulatory catch-up to monitor `` shadow banking . '' Her plan barely tackles symptoms while leaving the underlying illness untouched . To make matters worse , this issue is time-sensitive as there may be another financial crisis brewing with subprime auto loans . A collapse would spell disaster for the Democratic Party should it hit after eight years of President Obama with another Democrat in the Oval Office .\nHowever , Hillary seems unconcerned . She \u2019 s even attacked proponents of a new Glass-Steagall , on the premise that her policy is stronger\u2014the only plan that tackles shadow banking . As Zach Carter of the Huffington Post explains in his recent article titled \u201c Hillary Clinton Is Not Telling the Truth About Wall Street , \u201d her claims are dishonest . Shadow banking is a direct consequence of the too-big-to-fail model . The concentration of financial power in just six institutions is the fundamental problem we face . The size of the banks allowed them to exert unprecedented influence over rating agencies like S & P or Moody \u2019 s , due to the pay-per-rating model . This undermined the integrity of our entire rating system . At the same time , lenders were taking insurance policies out on their loans and products . The size of the banks and by extension , the sheer volume of the insured debt is why , when borrowers began defaulting , insurers like AIG went under . All of this could have been avoided with a decentralized banking system like the one Bernie Sanders is proposing .\nClinton 's stance on social programs and spending is equally disappointing to many liberals and progressives . Though she used to , she no longer supports universal healthcare . She explained her flip-flop during one of the few sanctioned DNC presidential debates by saying , `` [ t ] he revolution never came . '' Hillary is also against expanding Social Security . She does not support free college tuition for all . Instead she feels it should essentially be a means-tested welfare program . And speaking of welfare , Hillary has stood by her husband 's signing of the disastrous Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 ( aka welfare reform ) , deeming it `` necessary '' in spite of evidence that it caused a spike in extreme poverty particularly in minority communities . This bill was a Republican initiative\u2014part of the \u201c Contract With America . \u201d\nClinton is n't exactly Nancy Reagan on drugs , but her `` evolution '' on marijuana/cannabis has not come very far since the '90s\u2014and that 's difficult for many young Democrats to accept . Clinton also scares many environmentalists . She used to be in favor of the Keystone Pipeline until it became a political liability for her , and her State Department helped spread fracking to the rest of the world .\nShe also has trouble convincing some people of her support for LGBTQ equality . It wasn \u2019 t until 2013 that she fully embraced same-sex marriage . Prior to that she believed that marriage was a \u201c sacred bond between a man and a woman. \u201d She also supported the Defense of Marriage Act ( DOMA ) .\nShe hasn \u2019 t even been consistent on gun control . Sure , Clinton talks a big game now about background checks and modest reforms , supporting President Obama in his executive actions . But in 2008 , she was \u201c Annie Oakley , \u201d accusing Obama of being hostile to hunters \u2019 rights .\nEverything about Hillary Clinton \u2019 s record suggests that she will negotiate from the center/right\u2014leaving only one direction to go in compromising with Republicans : further right . Like her husband before her , she \u2019 ll likely use social programs and financial reform as bargaining chips . After all , she 's already given up on universal health care . Her commitment to campaign finance reform is also doubtful considering how much she is raising for this campaign from big donors ( Time Warner and Morgan Stanley are both in her top 10 ) . Clinton is not the candidate Democrats should back .\n1 ) Nominate Bernie Sanders . He \u2019 s the candidate drawing the largest crowds ; the candidate beating the GOP field by the widest margins in a majority of polls ; the candidate Americans feel is honest . If anyone has a shot at breaking the trend of back-and-forth in presidential elections , it is Sanders for the simple reason that he has been an independent for the majority of his political career . His outsider image gives him the greatest chance at beating the odds against consecutive two-term presidents from the same party .\n2 ) Let a Republican have four years . With a Hillary ticket , this scenario isn \u2019 t out of the question\u2014especially if the candidate is Donald Trump , who can run on the fact that he donated to Clinton . There 's a cold logic in this move . In 2020 , Democrats can run someone like Elizabeth Warren who excites the base . Coming off of four years with the GOP , a two-term presidency would be easily attainable with the added benefit that any economic downturns that happen between now and then would be blamed on Republicans . Even if one hit during the first term of the newly elected Democrat , the GOP would still take the fall . Also worth mentioning , people typically vote down the party line\u2014which is good for Democrats , considering it is a census year . 2020 could see the Democrats take the presidency , the House and the Senate\u2014and with the likelihood that two or three seats will open on the court , they \u2019 d control all three branches of government .\nThe downside to this option is that Senate Democrats would have to obstruct for four years . Such a move will exact a political cost , but as the Republicans have shown , obstruction is n't a death knell in elections . Of course , the main drawback is the fact that people will suffer as budgets are slashed .\nThere 's also the high probability that liberals will lose one seat on the Supreme Court , as well as federal judge appointments\u2014all of which be damaging . The only mitigating factor is that , as previously mentioned , there 's strong possibility that more seats will open up on the SCOTUS between 2020 and 2024 than between 2016 to 2020 .\n`` Bernie or Bust '' is undoubtedly a controversial position , as many Democrats insist that if Hillary Clinton gets the nod , she should be elected president . This argument relies on the-lesser-of-two-evils mind-set ; vote Hillary because she \u2019 s better than the GOP . However , with all things weighed and considered , it is clear that Clinton should neither be the Democratic nominee nor the president , and that her differences with her opponents are not so stark . The 2020 election cycle is far too important to risk it on a candidate who can barely relate to her own party now\u2014especially taking into account historical trends . Democrats must ask themselves where a Hillary presidency leaves the country in four years . Would her half-measures be enough that they would feel comfortable handing the keys over to the GOP in 2020 ? That is why `` Bernie or Bust '' is the real `` lesser-of-two-evils '' option .",
