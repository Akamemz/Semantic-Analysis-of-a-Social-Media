    "content": "Albert Einstein was one of the most important physicists of all time . His scientific predictions have withstood 100 years of scientific challenges . His thinking fundamentally changed the way we understand the universe . Yet people are more likely to be convinced Einstein wasn \u2019 t a great physicist than to change their minds on topics like immigration or the death penalty .\nIt has nothing to do with a person \u2019 s intelligence ( or the quality of information on Einstein or immigration policy ) . It \u2019 s due to the fact that we \u2019 re simply more open to changing our minds on nonpolitical topics . Scientists have been keen to figure out why \u2014 because if they can , it may open the door to the hardest challenge in politics right now : changing minds .\nPsychologists have been circling around a possible reason political beliefs are so stubborn : Partisan identities get tied up in our personal identities . Which would mean that an attack on our strongly held beliefs is an attack on the self . And the brain is built to protect the self .\nWhen we \u2019 re attacked , we evade or defend \u2014 as if we have an immune system for uncomfortable thoughts , one you can see working in real time .\n\u201c The brain \u2019 s primary responsibility is to take care of the body , to protect the body , \u201d Jonas Kaplan , a psychologist at the University of Southern California , tells me . \u201c The psychological self is the brain \u2019 s extension of that . When our self feels attacked , our [ brain is ] going to bring to bear the same defenses that it has for protecting the body . \u201d\nRecently , Kaplan has found more evidence that we tend to take political attacks personally . In a study recently published in Scientific Reports , he and collaborators took 40 self-avowed liberals who reported having \u201c deep convictions , \u201d put them inside in a functional MRI scanner , and started challenging their beliefs . Then they watched which parts of the participants \u2019 brains lit up . Their conclusion : When the participants were challenged on their strongly held beliefs , there was more activation in the parts of the brain that are thought to correspond with self-identity and negative emotions .\nThe study is limited . But it is intriguing new evidence that we mistake ideological challenges as personal insults . This suggests that to change minds , we need to separate opinions from identities \u2014 a task that proves particularly hard with politics .\nThe question of the study was this : What happens in the brain in the moment when we \u2019 re confronted with an argument that runs counter to our partisan identities ? To answer it , Kaplan and colleagues \u2014 including neuroscientist and author Sam Harris \u2014 set up an experiment .\n\u201c We didn \u2019 t set out to understand partisan stubbornness per se , \u201d Kaplan said . \u201c We wanted to understand what happens in the brain when we resist changing our minds . \u201d\nThe participants were shown a string of statements they were sure to agree with , like , \u201c The US should reduce its military budget . \u201d\nThe participants also saw a series of nonpolitical statements like , \u201c Thomas Edison invented the lightbulb , \u201d and , \u201c Albert Einstein is generally acknowledged to be one of the greatest physicists of all time \u201d ; those were also challenged with follow-up statements ( which were also exaggerated or manufactured at times ) . The point of these experiments was to compare reactions : Was there a difference in the way the participants \u2019 brains processed the challenges to their political beliefs versus something presumably less emotional like Edison \u2019 s legacy ?\nThere was .
