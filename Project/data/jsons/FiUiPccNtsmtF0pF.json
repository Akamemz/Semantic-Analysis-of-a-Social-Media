He thinks a torchlit march in which people did Nazi salutes , chanted , \u201c Sieg heil ! \u201d and assaulted counterprotesters was a good example of people \u201c very quietly protesting. \u201d And he thinks the violence distracted from the rally \u2019 s laudable aim , to defend a statue of Robert E. Lee .\nWhat Trump said Tuesday , in an unscripted press conference , made explicit all the darkest undertones of his gallingly weak statement from Saturday . In the face of a \u201c Nazified \u201d rally that left an American citizen dead , he muddied the waters ( all but lying about what happened over the weekend ) and softened his judgment of the march itself .\nAfter Saturday \u2019 s statement , white nationalists celebrated Trump \u2019 s support for them , while Americans of color worried that they had been abandoned . Tuesday \u2019 s remarks are nearly certain to convince both sides they were right .\nTrump basically lied about who was to blame in Charlottesville\nDuring Tuesday \u2019 s press conference , President Trump proclaimed that he \u2019 d been deliberately vague in his initial statement about Charlottesville because he \u201c wanted to make sure , unlike most politicians , that what I said was correct . ''\nThen he proceeded to lie about what happened , muddying the waters about who was really to blame in Charlottesville \u2014 and putting forward the idea that the counterprotesters and the marchers bore equal responsibility for what happened :\nWhat about the alt-left that came charging at , as you say , the alt-right , do they have any semblance of guilt ? \u2026 What about the fact that they came charging with clubs ? I think there is blame on both sides . You look at both sides . I think there is blame object on both sides . I have no doubt about it . You do n't have doubt about it either .

But the clearest and most comprehensive accounts of Charlottesville over the weekend aren \u2019 t so equivocal .\nThe violence was initiated , on Friday night , by right-wing marchers who assaulted protesters around a statue of Thomas Jefferson .
