As NPR 's Dina Temple-Raston said on All Things Considered , with the death earlier Friday of the suspect 's 26-year-old brother and alleged accomplice , Tamerlan Tsarnaev , investigators hope Dzhokhar will tell them `` if there are other people involved [ and ] if perhaps there are other bombs elsewhere .

The shooting of the officers followed the heavy toll from the marathon bombings \u2014 three dead and more than 170 people wounded .\nAs NPR 's Carrie Johnson reported Friday night , a Department of Justice official tells her that Tsarnaev will not be read his Miranda rights for now . `` We plan to invoke the public safety exception to Miranda in order to question the suspect extensively about other potential explosive devices or accomplices and to gain critical intelligence , '' the official said .\nThere are reports that at least three people who lived in New Bedford , Mass. , near where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev attended college , are being questioned . Authorities also detained at least one man in the early hours of Friday as they searched for Tsarnaev .\nWe 'll be following the news .

'' The Tsarnaev family 's ethnic roots trace back to Chechnya . ''\nLate Friday , the FBI released a statement that says , in part :\n`` The FBI reviewed its records and determined that in early 2011 , a foreign government asked the FBI for information about Tamerlan Tsarnaev . The request stated that it was based on information that he was a follower of radical Islam and a strong believer , and that he had changed drastically since 2010 as he prepared to leave the United States for travel to the country 's region to join unspecified underground groups . `` In response to this 2011 request , the FBI checked U.S. government databases and other information to look for such things as derogatory telephone communications , possible use of online sites associated with the promotion of radical activity , associations with other persons of interest , travel history and plans , and education history . The FBI also interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev and family members . The FBI did not find any terrorism activity , domestic or foreign , and those results were provided to the foreign government in the summer of 2011 . The FBI requested but did not receive more specific or additional information from the foreign government .

Wednesday, for example, there were reports from CNN, the AP, WBUR and others that authorities either had arrested a suspect or were about to do that. It turned out that no one had been arrested or taken into custody. We will focus on news being reported by NPR, other news outlets with expertise, and statements from authorities who are in a position to know what's going on. And if some of that information turns out to be wrong, we'll update.\n\nTake me back to the top of this post.",
