    "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President Donald Trump on Sunday issued a new ban on entry to the U.S. that applies a range of restrictions on nationals from eight countries , including new targets Chad , North Korea and Venezuela .\nThe new restrictions , replacing his previous order that expired on Sunday , apply to five of the six countries covered by the previous travel ban\u2014Iran , Libya , Somalia , Syria and Yemen . The African nation of Sudan was subject to the original ban but dropped under the new version .\nThe new rules take effect on Oct. 18 . Countries that were subject to an earlier version will operate under the old rules until then .\nThe new rules vary by country , with some nations facing outright travel bans and others subject to more limited restrictions . For instance , nationals of some countries are barred from migrating to the U.S. but are allowed to travel for school . Still , in most cases , the majority of potential travel to the U.S. will be banned .\n\u201c As president , I must act to protect the security and interests of the United States and its people , \u201d Mr. Trump wrote in the Sunday order .\nThe new order reflects painful lessons learned after intense criticism of two previous versions . Mr. Trump \u2019 s first executive order , issued after just a week in office , touched off confusion in airports , protests across the country and a quick judicial rebuke . The second version , in March , allowed for the restrictions to be phased in , but it too was put on hold by the courts almost immediately before the Supreme Court in June allowed a modified version to take effect .\nAdministration officials were hoping for a calmer reception this time , both from the public and the courts . For the first time , officials applied a set of objective standards to every nation to determine which countries pose a threat .\nIn one sense the ban was expanded , with the list of affected nations growing from six to eight . But the sanctions are more specific and targeted , with different rules for different countries , details that may help the administration defend itself in any court challenge .\nOfficials said they expect the new list will overcome charges that Mr. Trump \u2019 s order was a thinly disguised unconstitutional ban on Muslims . This time , two non-Muslim countries were included , though neither stands to be significantly affected by the new rules . North Korea allows few people to enter the U.S. , and a White House official said any North Korean refugees would be eligible for waivers . Venezuela \u2019 s restrictions are being applied only to certain government officials and their families , while most other countries face sweeping prohibitions .\n\u201c The number of Venezuelans and North Koreans affected is vanishingly tiny . It \u2019 s still a Muslim ban , \u201d said Omar Jadwat , who brought several of the court challenges for the American Civil Liberties Union .\nOpponents said the new version might be better but that doesn \u2019 t make it acceptable . \u201c Just because the original ban was especially outrageous does not mean we should stand for yet another version of government-sanctioned discrimination , \u201d said Naureen Shah , senior campaigns director for Amnesty International USA .\nTrump administration officials say just the threat of a travel ban persuaded more than a half dozen countries to change their policies and they are now cooperating more fully with the U.S. in vetting their citizens .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s proclamation also ordered additional scrutiny of Iraqis who seek to travel to the U.S . The order said Iraq didn \u2019 t meet the standards that the U.S. used to assess nations in its world-wide review , but the president opted not to restrict travel , citing the \u201c close cooperative relationship \u201d with the Iraqi government and the war in that country .\nThe new restrictions have no set end date . Rather , restrictions will be added or removed as conditions change , officials said . The new rules apply only to prospective visa applicants , not current visa holders , so the rollout is less likely to cause confusion at airports as was the case after Mr. Trump \u2019 s executive order in January .\nThe previous order came under sharp political attack , and legal challenges kept the rules on hold for months . The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on the outgoing executive order Oct. 10 . It wasn \u2019 t immediately certain how the new order would affect the case , but it is possible the justices could choose not to rule on an outdated travel ban that has been replaced by other restrictions .\nThe Justice Department on Sunday night filed a letter with the court suggesting that both sides in the litigation be required to file new legal briefs by Oct. 5 addressing what effect the new restrictions would have on the case .\nMr. Trump and his supporters said the original travel ban was needed to keep potential terrorists from entering the U.S . Critics pointed to Mr. Trump \u2019 s campaign promise to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. and said the executive order was driven by prejudice .\nIn evaluating countries for the new order , the administration considered three criteria : the integrity of documents , such as passports , that are used to confirm a person \u2019 s identity ; whether a country shares information with the U.S. about suspected terrorists and criminal histories of visa applicants ; and the national-security risk presented by each country , such as whether it is known as a terrorist safe haven .\nThe global review flagged 16 countries as being \u201c inadequate \u201d under one or more of the three criteria , and 31 others as at risk of becoming so . Facing the prospect of being included in a travel ban , many of these countries changed policies , administration officials said , and the list was whittled down . The administration also considered foreign-policy and national-security goals in determining whether to impose restrictions .\nSudan , which was subject to the previous travel bans , was found to meet the requirements during the initial world-wide review , an administration official said .\nUnder the order , two countries\u2014North Korea and Syria\u2014are subject to a ban on travel for people seeking to migrate to the U.S. and on those who just want to visit .\nThe order noted that North Korea doesn \u2019 t cooperate with the U.S. in \u201c any respect , \u201d a point underscored by the high-profile battle of insults and threats between Mr. Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un . Syria , the order says , doesn \u2019 t identify security risks and is a source of \u201c significant terrorist threats . \u201d\nNorth Korean citizens \u2019 ability to travel to the U.S. was already heavily restricted , largely by North Korea \u2019 s own isolation . An administration official said that the number of visas issued to North Koreans now was \u201c very low . \u201d\nNorth Korean officials at the United Nations didn \u2019 t answer a phone call seeking comment .\nThe administration is banning citizens of three countries\u2014Chad , Libya and Yemen\u2014from traveling to the U.S. on immigrant visas and on visas for business and tourism .\nThe presidential proclamation said the African country of Chad has shown a willingness to improve its policies but that it doesn \u2019 t adequately share information and has several terrorist organizations active in or near its borders . Just over half of Chad \u2019 s population is Muslim , according to the Central Intelligence Agency \u2019 s World Factbook .\nThe situation is similar in Libya and Yemen , the White House said , with willingness to help but not enough compliance and too much risk . Both of these countries were subject to the original travel ban and a revised version issued in March .\nThe order found Iran failed the U.S. standards in multiple ways and suspended travel for all Iranians except those on certain student and exchange visitor visas . Those people , though , were ordered to undergo enhanced vetting .\nThe restrictions on Venezuela are focused on government officials , not regular citizens , saying the U.S. has alternate ways of obtaining information on Venezuelans despite government noncooperation . Under the order , a range of government officials and their immediate family members are barred from entering on business or tourism visas . The order also directed additional screening on others from the South American country .\nThe inclusion of Venezuela came days after Mr. Trump pledged in a U.N. speech to take \u201c further action \u201d to escalate the isolation of the Venezuelan government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro , following moves by Mr. Maduro that the U.S. and other Latin American countries have characterized as a slide toward dictatorship . In both sanctions and public statements , the Trump administration has tried to draw a distinction between its desire to punish the government and its willingness to help the Venezuelan people .\nA spokesman for Venezuela \u2019 s Information Ministry wasn \u2019 t immediately available for comment .\nIn the case of Somalia , the administration concluded that it was meeting the \u201c bare minimum \u201d of U.S. demands but that it was also home to a \u201c persistent terrorist threat , \u201d officials said . The order bars admission of people seeking to move to the U.S. Those who want to visit will be subject to additional scrutiny to determine if they are connected to a terrorist organization .\nThe order allowed the administration to issue case-by-case waivers for a wide range of situations such as someone with close family in the U.S. or an infant in need of medical care .\nThe Supreme Court , ruling on the previous order , had instructed the administration to make exceptions for people who have \u201c bona fide \u201d relationships with people in the U.S. , such as close family members . The new proclamation doesn \u2019 t incorporate this blanket exception , except for during the transition period through Oct. 18 .",
