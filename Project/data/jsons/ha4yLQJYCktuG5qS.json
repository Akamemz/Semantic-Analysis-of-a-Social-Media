Jeb\u2019s growing list of unfortunate comments A look at some of Bush\u2019s most ill-worded comments since launching his campaign.\n\nA day after a massacre on a U.S. college campus, Jeb Bush said \u201cstuff happens\u201d but that it should not lead to tighter gun restrictions.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the 2016 contender, who has been struggling to connect with voters, has conveyed his ideas poorly.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, as the floundering candidate's two inelegant words shot around the Twittersphere and were seized upon by a reporter who paraphrased them in a question to President Obama during a White House press conference, the uproar did more to rally conservatives behind Bush than anything he himself has done in weeks.\n\n\"I've been tough on Jeb, but trying to turn this 'stuff happens' into a gaffe, never mind an outrage, is unfair and pathetic,\" tweeted National Review's Jonah Goldberg, part of a chorus of conservatives coming to Bush's defense.\n\nWhen he spoke to reporters, Bush clarified that his remark wasn't specifically in reference to the Oregon massacre.\n\n\"Let's make sure we don't allow this to get out of control,\" he said, unaware of the backlash already underway.\n\nAllie Brandenburger, spokesperson for Jeb Bush, said the comments were taken out of context. \u201cIt is sad and beyond craven that liberal Democrats, aided and abetted by some in the national media, would dishonestly take Governor Bush\u2019s comments out of context in a cheap attempt to advance their political agenda in the wake of a tragedy. Taking shameless advantage of a horrific tragedy is wrong and only serves to prey on people's emotions,\" Brandenburger said.\n\nBut it's a pattern that has played out multiple times already over the course of Bush's four months on the campaign trail: the candidate's words, even when the intended meaning is murky but still visible, hits a trip wire of some sort -- offending a specific constituency or inciting controversy and forcing Bush to clean up the mess, either by more carefully explaining himself or, in some cases, apologizing.\n\nHere are some of Bush\u2019s most ill-worded comments since launching his campaign:\n\n1. \u201cStuff happens\u201d\n\nSpeaking about gun control a day after the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, Bush said: \"We're in a difficult time in our country and I don't think more government is necessarily the answer to this. I think we need to reconnect ourselves with everybody else. It's very bad to see,\" the former Florida governor said. Then he added: \"Look, stuff happens and the impulse is always to do something and it's not necessarily the right thing to do.\"\n\n2. \u201cPeople need to work longer hours\u201d\n\nWeeks after his campaign launch, a comment Bush made to the editorial board of the New Hampshire Union Leader in July caught the eye of Democratic opposition researchers, who seized on the Republican\u2019s apparent suggestion that people weren\u2019t working hard enough.\n\n\u201cMy aspiration for the country and I believe we can achieve it, is 4 percent growth as far as the eye can see,\u201d Bush said. \u201cWhich means we have to be a lot more productive, workforce participation has to rise from its all-time modern lows.

But the political damage was done.\n\n3. \u201cPhase out\u201d Medicare\n\nDuring a town hall in Manchester, Bush was speaking about the need to reform Medicare when he said: \u201cWe need to figure out a way to phase out this program for others and move to a new system that allows them to have something \u2014 because they\u2019re not going to have anything.\u201d\n\nHe attempted to clarify the following day, explaining that he wants to reform Medicare rather than do away with the program altogether.\n\n4. Women\u2019s health programs overfunded\n\nIn the wake of the controversial videos showing Planned Parenthood staffers allegedly selling fetal tissue for profit, Bush was asked about the organization\u2019s funding during an appearance at a conference of evangelicals in South Carolina. But he misspoke, as he would quickly acknowledge, suggesting that the government spent too much money on \u201cwomen\u2019s health\u201d programs as a whole.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure we need half a billion dollars in funding for women\u2019s health programs,\u201d Bush said.\n\n5. \u201cAnchor Babies\u201d\n\nAs Donald Trump took up immigration reform, Bush, who had been blasting Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric, suddenly used a loaded term in a radio interview.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s abuse, if people are bringing \u2014 pregnant women are coming in to have babies simply because they can do it, then there ought to be greater enforcement,\u201d Bush said on Bill Bennett\u2019s conservative radio show, \u201cMorning in America,\u201d in August. \u201cThat\u2019s [the] legitimate side of this. Better enforcement so that you don\u2019t have these, you know, \u2018anchor babies\u2019, as they\u2019re described, coming into the country.\u201d\n\n6. Anchor Babies redux\n\nA day later in New Hampshire, Bush defended his usage of \u201canchor babies\u201d to reporters. \u201cYou give me a better term and I\u2019ll use it,\u201d Bush snapped. \u201cGive me another word.\u201d\n\n7. He meant \u201cAsians\u201d\n\nThe next week during a trip to the border town of McAllen, Tex., Bush attempted to clean up the \u201canchor babies\u201d mess and inadvertently committed another gaffe, explaining that the phenomenon he referred to was mainly due to Asians.\n\n\u201cWhat I was talking about was the specific case of fraud being committed where there\u2019s organized efforts \u2014 frankly, it\u2019s more related to Asian people coming into our country, having children in that organized efforts, taking advantage of a noble concept, which is birthright citizenship,\u201d Bush said.\n\n8. Multiculturalism\n\nDuring a September event in Iowa, Bush, who is married to woman of Mexican ancestry and speaks Spanish at home and on the campaign trail, asserted his opposition to multiculturalism.\n\n\"We should not have a multicultural society,\" Bush said at an event in Iowa, before beginning a longer explanation of his views of what comprises culture in the United States\n\n\"When you create pockets of isolation \u2014 and in some places the process of assimilation has been retarded because they've slowed down \u2014 it's wrong,\" he added. \"It limits people's aspirations.\"\n\n9. \u201cFree Stuff\u201d\n\nTwo nights later in South Carolina, less than an hour after he clarified to reporters what he was trying to say about multiculturalism\u2014which, he explained, differs from pluralism\u2014Bush responded to a question at a shrimp dinner fundraiser about how he planned to win a greater share of the African-American vote than previous Republican nominees, should he win the primary.\n\n\"Our message is one of hope and aspiration,\" Bush said to a friendly crowd of 300. \"It isn't one of division and get in line and we'll take care of you with free stuff. Our message is one that is uplifting \u2014 that says you can achieve earned success.\"",
