Some new jobs are likely , industry analysts say , but they add that market forces \u2013 notably low prices for oil and natural gas \u2013 make a boom in oil-patch investment unlikely . Also , amid the price bust of the past two years , energy companies have become more efficient . That means that , even if prices may now be tilting upward , firms can produce oil and gas with fewer people .\nOther energy jobs \u2013 in solar and wind power \u2013 could shrink under an administration that so far shows no enthusiasm for boosting the rise of clean power supplies .\n`` President Trump 's policies will help fossil fuels and hurt renewables , '' energy research firm Doyle Trading Consultants said in a December report for clients , and `` much of the help on the fossil fuel side will help gas rather than coal . ''\n`` Pipelines will alleviate bottlenecks in the supply chain , ... lowering oil and gas prices less than people might think , '' added the Colorado-based firm , which specializes in the coal industry . `` Global energy trends will still be in the driver 's seat . ''\nIn theory , lower energy prices can fuel job creation in the wider economy , by making energy cheaper and more available to everyone from manufacturers to vacationers . But low prices , or worries about future profitability , can make energy firms less eager to drill and mine , and undercut job growth in that sector .\nIt 's an equation that coal workers already know well , as competition from cheaper natural gas has been eroding their employment for years .\n`` Revitalizing coal industry , of course we would love to see it .... I worry about [ Trump \u2019 s ] promises with the coal industry because the gas is so cheap , '' says Ben Wilkinson , president of the Utility Workers Union of America System Local 102 , which represents workers in coal- and gas-fired power plants in Pennsylvania and several neighboring states .\n`` I 'm trying to give him the benefit of the doubt with what he says , like working for the people , '' Mr. Wilkinson adds . `` As a labor person , seeing his track record and what he did in his professional life , and who he 's brought into his cabinet , I have a lot of reservations . But I 'm still going to try to be optimistic , and I hope he does the right thing . ''\nTrump pledged on his campaign website an `` America First Energy Plan '' to `` make America energy independent , create millions of new jobs , and protect clean air and clean water .... We will unleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth to our country . ''\nOne economic analysis , published by the conservative Institute for Energy Research ( IER ) , has predicted that 2.7 million jobs could be created by opening more federal lands for energy extraction . One-quarter of the jobs would be directly in energy , the rest in other parts of the economy . Most would come down the road , not before the next presidential election .\nOther economists have questioned the report 's methodology , however . For one thing , its projected energy-job gains are enormous , given current job figures in the industry . About 400,000 US jobs are in oil and gas production , and about 54,000 in mining coal , according to federal statistics , for example .\nOpening up federal lands `` wo n't necessarily lead to more wells if natural gas prices are low , '' says Lincoln Pratson , a professor at Duke University \u2019 s Nicholas School of the Environment .\nNevertheless , gas has displaced coal as the fuel of choice for electric power \u2013 not only because of its price but also because of its status as a cleaner fuel , as the American public and investment community press for a lower-carbon economy .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t know how they will really change those fundamental market forces , \u201d says Susan Tierney , a former assistant secretary for policy at the US Department of Energy . \u201c It \u2019 s really a race between [ natural ] gas and coal . If the new administration and Congress can find a way to change that it would surprise me . ''\nTrump has pledged to \u201c embrace the shale oil and gas revolution , \u201d boosting the industries in part by revoking policies restricting new drilling technologies and by lifting moratoriums on energy production .\nAlready , since energy companies began applying horizontal drilling techniques to hydraulic fracturing ( or fracking ) in 2009 the gas industry has taken off . US natural gas production increased 33 percent between 2005 and 2013 , according to the Energy Department , and last year it surpassed coal as the country \u2019 s largest source of electricity , even though about 95 percent of American coal is used to generate electricity .\nIn essence , Trump has promised to do everything in his power to boost the \u201c supply \u201d side of the fossil fuel market , such as by opening new leases and relaxing regulations . The pipelines , too , would add to America 's energy infrastructure , allowing US refiners to process Canadian fuel in the case of Keystone . That in turn could lead to exports as well as domestic sales .\nBut the other half of the free market equation is the demand side , and there presidents are almost completely at the whim of market forces .\nDomestically , risks on the demand side have been seen recently in idle fracking wells , as a glut of gas has depressed demand . A May tally of almost 400,000 jobs in oil and gas production is down from a peak of 538,000 in October 2014 , according to the US Energy Information Administration .\nFor oil , the major use is in transportation , and Professor Pratson says that demand from car drivers and truckers looks more stable than poised for big increases .\n`` The real market is the international market , and there you 're up against some heavy hitters , like the Middle East , '' he says .\nFor gas , he says a way to influence demand could be by increasing the permitting of liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) facilities for export .

The Mercury and Air Toxics Standards ( MATS ) rule has contributed to some coal plant retirements , and Mr. Obama \u2019 s Clean Power Plan , which now appears likely to be blocked , would impose strict emissions requirements on coal-fired power plants .\nEven though the plan is n't in effect ( it 's now in court ) , many utilities have switched over to gas-fired plants in anticipation of the rule . His administration \u2019 s Waters of the US rule , which limits energy development near waterways , has made mining on private land more difficult . A moratorium on energy production on federal lands made mining on public land harder as well .\n\u201c Trump can not reverse the damage that \u2019 s already been done , \u201d says John Hanou , a coal industry analyst . \u201c He \u2019 s going to make it easier for companies to develop energy sources , and then it \u2019 s going to be the market that determines what plants run and what plants don \u2019 t . \u201d\nCoal country politicians and industry leaders have been making similar noises .
