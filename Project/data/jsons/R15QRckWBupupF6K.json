    "content": "You \u2019 re probably going to read this as sour grapes , and I certainly am sour about a family of kleptocrats moving into the White House because 80,000 of your votes in states that get more federal tax dollars than they put in trump 2.7 million of ours , even though we carry you financially , and California and New York could function just fine as our own countries , without you .\nBut the reality is , I do live in a blue state . My governor and mayor are Democrats . Undocumented immigrants are safe where I live . Two of my kids attend a private college , so they wouldn \u2019 t have gotten free tuition anyway , and the third goes to a really good public school , where they teach science . I have a job ( actually , multiple jobs ) that can \u2019 t be outsourced to Mexico . And I \u2019 ll probably get a tax cut . So I \u2019 ll be fine over the next four years , as long as I don \u2019 t encounter an angry cop who \u2019 s had a bad day . But allow me to be blunt , since I don \u2019 t have any desire to pander to you , and it wouldn \u2019 t work to pander to you anyway .\nYou voted for Donald Trump , thinking that he was on your side ; that he will save your jobs and your way of life , whatever you imagine that is . Well , you got played .\nOver the course of his decades in business , Donald Trump has never given a damn about people like you . When he tore down the old Bonwit Teller building\u2014where my Jamaican godmother was one of the few black women allowed to work as a cashier in the 1960s ( her big claim to fame was meeting Troy Donahue ) \u2014to build Trump Tower , Trump used undocumented white laborers , mostly Polish , to do it . When his company forced them to work in deplorable , dangerous conditions and even failed to pay them the meager wages they were promised and they complained , Trump threatened to have them deported .\nTrump built Trump Tower using mob concrete , not Bethlehem steel . In fact , he has rarely used American steel in the few buildings he \u2019 s actually built ; opting for Chinese steel instead . That includes two of his last three projects : the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas and the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago . Then again , Nevada and Illinois voted with us in the anti-Trump majority , so the joke wasn \u2019 t exactly on them .\nI wish to God the Clinton campaign had spent every waking month telling you guys about this stuff , instead of allowing the moving and cinematic \u201c Man of Steel \u201d TV adby a pro-Trump super PAC probably funded by the same billionaires to whom he \u2019 s about to give massive top-rate and corporate tax cuts , to stand . But they didn \u2019 t . And here we are .\nNow , your supposed hero of the working class , the \u201c blue collar billionaire \u201d who you insisted both during the campaign and afterward heard you , understood you , spoke to you , and cared about you , is attacking one of you . Trump used his Twitter account this week to savage United Steelworkers 1999 of Indiana and its president , Chuck Jones , an ordinary working man who dared to tell the truth about the phony Carrier deal that the media shamefully allowed Trump to ride to glowing headlines and boosted poll numbers .\nTo review , Trump used his Twitter feed to credit himself for saving 1,100 jobs at Indiana furnace and air conditioning manufacturer Carrier . In fact , it was still-governor Mike Pence , Trump \u2019 s soon-to-be vice president , who cut the deal to hand over $ 7 million in state tax abatements to Carrier in exchange for delaying the movement of 770 jobs to the company \u2019 s new plant in Monterrey , Mexico . That move , over the next three years , and the shutdown of the Indianapolis plant , is still planned . Another 300 white collar jobs Trump claimed credit for , meaning researchers and administrators , not steel workers , were not being moved to Mexico in the first place . And an additional 600 jobs at that plant , plus 700 at a plant in nearby Huntington , Indiana , plus 350 more at a ball bearings factory owned by Rexnord Corp. , are still being shipped south of the border .\nMeanwhile , despite the willingness of the incoming Trump-Pence administration to bribe a company with your tax dollars , there \u2019 s no guarantee that the small number of jobs saved are more than temporary . For all you know , Carrier only agreed to delay moving those 770 jobs until Christmas , to get the good press . And unlike President Obama \u2019 s deal to save literally millions of auto industry jobs in 2009 , there \u2019 s no agreement for Carrier to pay taxpayers back with interest .\nWhen Jones pointed out that Trump used Carrier employees as props and \u201c lied his ass off \u201d about the jobs he was supposedly saving , Trump got mad . He tweeted at Jones , blaming him , and US1999 , for driving jobs out of Indiana and out of the United States . Think about that for a moment\u2014your next president doesn \u2019 t think corporate greed and the pursuit of low wages are driving jobs out ; he thinks unions are . That means he thinks your health care benefits and retirement package are the problem , not your CEO and the singular goal of \u201c enhancing shareholder value \u201d at your expense . Sounds like a proper plutocrat to me . Well , Trump went after Mr. Jones , and now Mr. Jones is getting death threats .\nYou see , Trump is \u201c for \u201d you , as long as you \u2019 re quiet and obedient . The moment you step out of line and stop praising him , it \u2019 s on . He \u2019 ll treat you no differently from how he treated the Gold Star family , the Khans , or former Miss Universe Alicia Machado for criticizing him during the campaign . You didn \u2019 t care much about them , since they belonged to groups you were voting to sideline\u2014the Muslims and the Hispanics you think are taking over \u201c your \u201d country . But you might want to give a damn about Mr. Jones . Because what Trump is doing to him is a sign of things to come for you .\nMeanwhile , Trump torched the stock of another American manufacturing company , Boeing , in retaliation for its CEO criticizing him ; first inflating the size of their new contract to upgrade the Air Force One fleet , and then threatening to cancel the deal altogether , which would cost American jobs and help Boeing \u2019 s only competitor : Airbus , of France .\nTrump is a big businessman . He \u2019 s your boss or CEO , not one of your brothers on the line .\nHe is on record saying that in his view , wages in the U.S. are too high . Trump \u2019 s pick for labor secretary , fast-food CEO Andy Puzder , is against raising the federal minimum wage , too .\nTrump the CEO manufacturers his tacky suits and ties in Mexico and his daughter manufactures her clothes and shoes in China . But neither of them plan to set the example for their fellow tycoons by moving those jobs to the U.S.A. Ivanka is moving some of her production to Ethiopia . And she just struck a new production deal in Japan , while on the phone with her dad and the Japanese prime minister . The Trumps have spent exactly zero percent of their lives caring about anyone other than themselves . Don \u2019 t expect that to change now , especially since they can now enrich themselves on international bribes , courtesy of daddy \u2019 s new job .\nTrump \u2019 s threat ( again via Twitter ) of a 35 percent tax on companies who ship jobs overseas is complete bull . It \u2019 s never going to happen , and he knows it . It \u2019 s Congress , not the president , that moves legislation . And this Congress , which you voted for , is controlled by Republicans like House Speaker Paul Ryan , who don \u2019 t want to take the country back to the 1950s , where you want to go , but rather to the 1920s . You might want to Google \u201c Calvin Coolidge \u201d or order the collected works of Aldous Huxley for Christmas if you need a primer .\nMany of you voted based on the fiction that Hillary Clinton was going to take your guns\u2014the way Barack Obama sent fleets of black helicopters to take them , right ? Just pause for a moment to think about how ridiculous that sounds ; sending who , the military , door to door to collect your silly firearms ? Wake up , people . That idea is as foolish as the notion that before Nov. 9 you weren \u2019 t allowed to say \u201c Merry Christmas . \u201d\nSo Merry Christmas , Trump voters . Your guns are safe . They always were . Instead , while Trump is entertaining you by hiring white generals named \u201c Mad Dog \u201d to make you feel powerful again , the Republicans in Congress fully intend to take away every program that saved your parents and grandparents from the Great Depression .\nSure , they \u2019 re coming for \u201c Obamacare \u201d first . And you \u2019 re happy about that because you think that \u2019 s just free insurance for black \u201c Obama phone \u201d users and so-called illegals . But it \u2019 s not . It \u2019 s the access to insurance covering 20 million people , including millions of people like you ; including 400,000 of you in very-not-black Kentucky . It \u2019 s covering disabled kids and people with pre-existing conditions , many who are too sick to get insurance without it . And Ryan and his friends want to cancel it , and then take three years to replace it , probably with Ryan \u2019 s favorite thing : vouchers .\nBut that \u2019 s not all . Ryan is also coming for Medicare . He wants to privatize that , too , and not for your mom and dad\u2014they vote in midterms . He \u2019 s going to privatize it for you . So when you retire , working stiff in your forties or fifties , you \u2019 re going to get a handful of vouchers , instead of Medicare . And he \u2019 s also coming for Medicaid , to turn it into a block grant . That \u2019 s not a problem for me , since my blue state will keep caring for our poor . Your state\u2014with its Republican governor and legislature ? Not so much . Your emergency rooms are going to fill up with the sick , and your bankruptcy courts will fill up with their cases when they can \u2019 t pay the bills . And your rural hospitals are going to close .\nYou \u2019 ve turned your country over the top tenth of 1 percent . Talk about \u201c establishment. \u201d Their interest is not in helping you . It \u2019 s in further enriching themselves , by privatizing every public program\u2014Social Security can \u2019 t be far behind\u2014dropping the corporate and top income tax brackets as close to zero as possible , and making you pay , for everything from privatized roads owned by multinational corporations to elementary school . They \u2019 re into taking land , including our public lands and parks , or using another Trump favorite\u2014public domain\u2014to drill and frack , endangering your water just as surely as they poisoned Flint \u2019 s . And when they can \u2019 t steal any more from the Native Americans\u2014who have shown they still have some fight left\u2014they \u2019 ll come for your farms .\nIn Michigan , Republicans have already gotten started . They voted to further gut unions \u2019 ability to bargain for decent health care and retirement through the use of strikes , and congressional Republicans have already voted to strip the \u201c buy American \u201d clause out of a bill to repair the nation \u2019 s water infrastructure .\nAs for black Trump supporters , don \u2019 t be fooled . Remember when Trump said he didn \u2019 t want black people counting his money , only Jewish people ? Well look at his appointments . He didn \u2019 t even respect neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson enough to insist that he take over Health and Human Services . Instead , he \u2019 s tossing the black guy in the \u201c urban \u201d chair .\nSo good luck , Trump voters . I hope at some point you realize what \u2019 s happening and fight back . Your choices , unfortunately , do affect us all , and they will until we wake up and junk the Electoral College , which puts rural states \u2019 zeal for Christian rule ahead of blue states \u2019 desire for good government .\nUntil then , all I can do is try to warn you , and then wish you good luck .",
