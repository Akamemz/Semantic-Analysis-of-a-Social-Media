    "content": "The Trump administration has quietly maintained an Obama-era approach to countering aggression from Moscow even as the president \u2019 s dismissal of Russian meddling in the election and warm words toward that country \u2019 s leader have scandalized Washington .\nIt approved the largest commercial sale of lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine since 2014 \u2014 a move that earned praise from both sides of the aisle on Capitol Hill \u2014 and implemented sanctions targeting people in Russia for human rights abuses under a U.S. law some onlookers fretted the president might try to evade .\nIt increased the budget for the European Deterrence Initiative , an effort begun under former President Obama to bolster allies \u2019 defenses in response to Russian aggression , and deployed U.S. soldiers to Poland as part of a majority-U.S. NATO task force .\nAnd it is poised to announce more sanctions against Russia , faced with a Jan. 29 deadline to name targets under a separate law grudgingly signed byover the summer.Even some Obama officials call the approach \u201c mainstream. \u201d \u201c The policy has been [ in ] continuity with the Obama administration post-2014 , after the Russian invasion of Ukraine , \u201d said Daniel Fried , who under Obama served as the State Department \u2019 s sanctions coordinator. \u201c I think the actual policies on the ground have been pretty good , \u201d said Fried , who also worked as a senior official on Russia issues during the Bush administration.But those policies have been obscured by the president \u2019 s unusually warm rhetoric toward the Kremlin.In a speech earlier this month designed to roll out his national security strategy \u2014 a document that labels Russia a \u201c revisionist \u201d power and casts it as a fundamental competitor of the United States \u2014 Trump eschewed the tough language and said it was his desire to build a \u201c great partnership \u201d with Moscow . He recounted a phone call from Russian President Vladimir Putin thanking him for an intelligence tip as \u201c the way it \u2019 s supposed to work. \u201d Trump also discounts the intelligence community \u2019 s assessment that Putin personally directed an influence campaign during the 2016 election to help install him in office . The Russian president has denied the charges and Trump has said that he \u201c believe [ s ] that when he tells me that , he means it. \u201d Current officials dismissed the notion that there is any inconsistency between the president \u2019 s attitude toward Russia and the administration \u2019 s policies. \u201c If you look at the actions that we take , those are the things that ultimately matter . Those are the things that we \u2019 re doing , \u201d an administration official told \u2588\u2588\u2588.The president \u2019 s language is an important part of that broader strategy because it highlights \u201c what we want our relationship to be , \u201d the official said . \u201c I don \u2019 t know anyone who works on Russia who would tell you it \u2019 s not in our interests to have a good relationship with the Russians. \u201d But , the official continued , \u201c We do have this two-pronged approach \u2014 we want to find areas of cooperation with them but at the same time we \u2019 re not just going to stand by idly and let them run over us. \u201d In general , the official said , \u201c the type of actions that you \u2019 ve seen are consistent \u201d with the previous administration.In the early months of his presidency , speculation churned that Trump would back away from U.S. NATO commitments in the region , roll back Obama-era sanctions punishing Moscow for meddling in the 2016 election and return two diplomatic compounds widely believed to be a home base for Russian spies.But in reality , former diplomats say , the administration \u2019 s concrete policies suggest a modest toughening against Russia.The European Deterrence budget increase was \u201c a very big deal , \u201d according to Fried \u2014 and an apparent reversal of Trump \u2019 s claims on the campaign trail that NATO was \u201c obsolete. \u201d The lethal weapons sale to the Ukrainian army earned praise from lawmakers in both parties , as did the implementation of the congressionally-mandated Magnitsky Act sanctions , which Fried said was \u201c a sound piece of work. \u201d And although the administration fiercely opposed the new set of sanctions passed by Congress in August \u2014 the administration official cited technical concerns \u2014 it appears poised to implement them by the end of next month. \u201c So far , if you read the interpretive guidance that State and Treasury have sent out , it \u2019 s been solid , \u201d said Fried . \u201c It has not felt , to me , like somebody was putting the brakes on. \u201d The administration has also declined so far to return the Russian diplomatic compounds , or dachas , seized by the Obama administration as part of a slate of penalties for its active measures campaign during the election.In that case , Congress has tied the administration \u2019 s hands . The new sanctions law also prevents the administration from returning the compounds without congressional approval.Before that law was passed , the official said , the administration had \u201c gone back and forth with the Russians on how to do this and they consistently turned down our different approaches. \u201d The official declined to offer specifics on what conditions the administration offered.Despite Trump \u2019 s promises of a warmer relationship , U.S.-Russia relations have remained sour .
