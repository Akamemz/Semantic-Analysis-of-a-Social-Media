    "content": "After years of debate , Andrew Cuomo 's administration has decided to ban fracking across New York State . Since 2008 , New York has had a temporary moratorium on hydraulic fracturing , a method of extracting natural gas from shale rock . But environmental commissioner Joseph Martens announced he will make the ban permanent next year . The announcement came after New York 's Health Department released a long-awaited report on the health risks from fracking , which cited the risks of drinking-water contamination ( among other things ) . `` We do n't have the evidence to prove or disprove the health effects. , '' Health Commissioner Howard Zucker said . `` But the cumulative concerns of what I 've read gives me reason to pause . '' Martens also said that the state was unlikely to reap huge economic benefits from allowing fracking \u2014 in part because 170 cities and towns in New York have already passed their own local bans .
