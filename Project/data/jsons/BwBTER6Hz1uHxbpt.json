    "content": "Those were the last words of the last episode of \u201c The Colbert Report , \u201d a delightful , zany half-hour that had to do the hard work of saying goodbye to one of the oddest creations on television . \u201c The Colbert Report \u201d was a fake-news late-night show on a comedy network that leaned hard left by pretending to lean hard right ; try explaining that to anyone in 20 years , and see where it gets you . The final words seemed to be a nod to the ephemeral nature of the show\u2014Stephen Colbert , a character played by a comedian named Stephen Colbert , floated away to eternity , guided by Santa Claus , unicorn Abraham Lincoln , and , obviously , Alex Trebek ( the man with all the answers ; every answer is a question ) .\nAnd with his last word he tossed the ball back to Jon Stewart , the guy who ran the show that Colbert spawned from , the guy who will be holding down the fort after the real Colbert moves on to CBS . And after Jon Stewart himself said goodnight to the audience , the episode cut to an exchange between the two from June 3 , 2010\u2014probably an outtake\u2014with a rare occurrence indeed . Stephen Colbert broke character . Stewart asks : \u201c Hey Stephen , what are you doing ? \u201d Colbert responds : \u201c I \u2019 m getting angry at liberals , \u201d a grin cracking his face .\nIt felt like a perfectly fitting coda . Whoever or whatever \u201c The Late Show With Stephen Colbert \u201d will be hosted by , it will not be \u201c The Colbert Report \u201d \u2019 s Stephen Colbert , the one who presented to Congress and spoke at the White House Correspondents \u2019 Association dinner in flawless , pitch-perfect character . Unless CBS and mainstream American audiences are in for the craziest long-con prank in history , Stephen Colbert will no longer be America \u2019 s most conservative superhero , but a guy who talks to celebrities about upcoming movies and does a minutes-long stand-up introduction to the show . Colbert being okay , he \u2019 ll find a way to make it interesting\u2014and , in all likelihood , sneakily liberal\u2014but look , it \u2019 s not going to be this . It \u2019 s not going to be Stephen Colbert acting out lightning striking him and making him immortal ; it \u2019 s not going to be dozens if not hundreds of former guests on the show gathering into a small Comedy Central studio to sing \u201c We \u2019 ll Meet Again \u201d \u2014which , incidentally , also plays over the end of \u201c Dr .

Finales of beloved shows are typically terrible ; \u201c The Colbert Report \u201d found a way to go out in an over-the-top style that felt true to the show \u2019 s batty humor .\nBecause that \u2019 s the thing : \u201c Colbert Report \u201d wasn \u2019 t always a bona fide hit ; it wasn \u2019 t always something people got .
