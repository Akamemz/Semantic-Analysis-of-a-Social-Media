    "content": "Two weeks ago , as Nick Gillespie reported in this space , Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson said that it was `` game over '' if he was not included in the first 2016 presidential debate on Sept. 26 . Given that the Democratic/Republican-controlled `` nonpartisan '' Commission on Presidential Debates ( CPD ) will choose the debate roster in mid-September based on a five-agency polling average that currently sits at 8.8 percent , well short of the required 15 percent , for Johnson , the irresistible force of the LP 's debate-centric focus has been on a collision course with the immovable object of the CPD 's unreasonably high threshold . Until , it seems , this afternoon .\nNo matter how much independent-bent political celebrities such as Mitt Romney , Arnold Schwarzenegger , and Mitch Daniels support the L.P. ticket being included in the debates , and no matter how much that motion is seconded by solid majorities of the American voting public , rules are rules , and when said rules are written by the Republican and Democratic parties , Libertarians are screwed .
