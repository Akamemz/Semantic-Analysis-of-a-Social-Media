    "content": "Americans began heading anew this weekend to President Obama \u2019 s official Obamacare Facebook page to gather information on the new round of health care enrollment , share their experiences shopping for insurance on the federal exchange and voice their opinions on the president \u2019 s signature domestic achievement .\nHowever , what some would view as a robust marketplace of ideas is actually controlled by just a few , an analysis of the Web page shows .\nSixty percent of the site \u2019 s 226,838 comments generated from September 2012 to early last month can be attributed to fewer than 100 unique profiles , according to an analysis completed by The \u2588\u2588\u2588 with assistance from an outside data analytics team . Many of those profiles belong to just one person who created multiple aliases or personas to widen her influence and multiply her voice .\nCindi Huynh , an Obamacare supporter in California , posted on average 59 times a day on the site in 60 days , making her the No . 1 poster in that period . She posted only during work hours \u2014 as is the trend of the top 25 posters on the site \u2014 and never on weekends .\nOver the past two years , Ms. Huynh has been a prolific poster \u2014 ranking twice in the top 25 profiles contributing to the site \u2014 once under the name \u201c Cindi Huynh \u201d and again as \u201c Cyndi Huynh Vellucci . \u201d\nMs. Huynh has had at least four Facebook profiles , she confirmed .\nMs. Huynh told The Times that she has never been paid for her posts but has volunteered for the California Democratic Party and was approached to become an Obamacare patient advocate . She said she was too busy to contribute in that way and felt she could better spread the message online . She has a full-time job but has declined to name her employer .\nCopious posters on the Obamacare site , like Ms. Huynh , were not all so easily identifiable . Once The Times made known it was conducting an investigation into the audience on the site , at least three pro-Obamacare commentators disappeared or deactivated their accounts .\n\u2022 Wanda Milner has posted 4,695 times in the entire timeline evaluated , putting her in the top 25 commentators . Ms. Milner , who is from Canada , told The Times she was passionate about the issue and decided to get active about it . She denied having any aliases or being paid for her actions , but said fake pages were created to mock her . She has \u201c liked \u201d many of Ms. Huynh \u2019 s comments as well as those of other pro-Obamacare posters .\n\u2022 Paul J. Nunley is an anti-Obamacare poster who made 2,316 posts in 60 days , ranking only behind Ms. Huynh . A retired veteran from New Mexico , Mr. Nunley said he dedicates his full time to the site to try to \u201c rid it of misinformation. \u201d In the process of doing so , he has made friends with Ms. Huynh and other top posters , and has engaged in online fighting , leading to multiple timeouts of his profile .\n\u2022 Eileen A. Wolf , from North Dakota , posted 5,870 times in the entire period evaluated and 325 times in 60 days . She also used the account of her husband , James Wolf , to post prolifically under his name , Mr. Wolf said .\nThe official Obamacare page is controlled by Organizing for Action , the president \u2019 s former political action committee and now a nonprofit group . It has more than 771,000 Facebook \u201c likes \u201d and is updated every day with a new link promoting the policy .\nThe more likes , links , content and comments generated off the site move it higher in the list of Google searches , meaning the very few who are posting on the site obsessively are able to drive it as a top return in another person \u2019 s Google search \u2014 no matter the ideological tilt of the comments .\nOrganizing for Action declined to comment to The Times when asked whether it hired paid commentators to post on the site during high-traffic days or tried to spur online conversation through volunteers .\nOrganizing for Action also handles the president \u2019 s Twitter feed . This summer , it was found that nearly half of the president \u2019 s 43 million followers at the time appeared to be fake , according to researchers at Barracuda , a computer security company in Campbell , California . Organizing for Action also declined to comment at that time .\nOrganizing for Action employs Blue State Digital , the digital public relations mastermind behind Mr. Obama \u2019 s revolutionary online campaign , both in 2008 and 2012 , according to Blue State Digital \u2019 s website . The firm is cited by its peers as a leader in using digital tools to create both a persuasive and informative online forum .\nIt was Blue State Digital that invented an online tool for users to organize a campaign event in their hometowns and then watch their Web \u201c thermometer \u201d rise as their contacts increased . Once somebody in the social media world sent their email address to the organization , influential people such as first lady Michelle Obama would respond back , relaying the president \u2019 s talking points for that week .\nWith Blue State \u2019 s help , the Obama campaign in 2008 collected the email addresses of 13 million supporters and organized them into lists , segmenting them by social networks , contributions and favored issues , according to a Boston Globe profile written about the firm shortly after Mr. Obama \u2019 s first winning presidential election .\nBlue State Digital , which is based in Boston , declined to comment for this article .\nWith Facebook \u2019 s 1.23 billion monthly users and Twitter \u2019 s more than 240 million , a campaign or political point of view can reach millions instantly and the trends on social media often become segments on the nightly news .\nE.J . Dionne told his readers at The Washington Post during the 2012 presidential contest to watch their Twitter feeds to get an unfettered view of who won the second debate .\nHowever , social media is anything but unfettered . It can be leveraged to spread rumors , undercut the opposition or create a false sense of public pressure , computer analysts and public relations representatives say .\n\u201c There have been smear campaigns since Adams and Jefferson in the early 1800s and we \u2019 re seeing the same thing here , with just a new set of tools , \u201d said Richard Levick , chairman and chief executive officer of Levick , a public relations and strategic communications firm in Washington .\n\u201c Where do undecided voters , journalists go to get their information ? Google . So controlling the search engine is hugely important . We need to know who is our audience , how do we reach them , how do we engage them , and then , how do we control the territory ? \u201d he said .\nMany digital public relations shops are deploying social media robots , or \u201c socialbots , \u201d built by software programmers and deployed by political campaigns to block Twitter feeds , build support for otherwise unpopular opinions and create a flood of content for their own agendas that hopefully will end up in someone \u2019 s Facebook or Twitter feed and then be liked or reposted by a real individual .\nThe technique has been so widely used that the National Science Foundation and the Defense Department have awarded a grant to Indiana University to study the phenomenon and develop an application to detect whether a real person or an android is sending a social media message .\nThe select few masquerading as a crowd are hijacking social media to \u201c effectively attack the democratic process , \u201d said P. Takis Metaxas , a computer science professor at Wellesley College who studied social media manipulation in the 2012 election cycle .\n\u201c As social animals , we are influenced by our peers \u2019 opinions in many ways . In our research we have seen political zealots interested in the electoral results , time and time again . They do not want to let chance , or their enemies , determine an electoral outcome . So they try to create content that would fool social networks into promoting their own candidates and , in some cases , into spreading lies to the detriment of their opponents , \u201d Mr. Metaxas said .\nFor example , during the 2010 U.S. Senate special election campaign in Massachusetts , Mr. Metaxas found an attacker used nine Twitter alias accounts to send about 1,000 tweets in a little over two hours . Real users retweeted the message and it reached more than 60,000 people in one day .\nThe \u201c Twitter bomb \u201d seemed to come from a group of concerned citizens , but it likely started with one person or political group trying to alter public opinion , Mr. Metaxas said .\nIn its annual report , Twitter estimated that less than 5 percent of its 240 million customers \u2014 about 12 million \u2014 represent fake or alias accounts .\n\u201c As operatives we have to remember that Twitter is not a representative sample . One or two Twitter loudmouths can make minor issues seem tremendously important when they are , in fact , completely irrelevant , \u201d Mark Harris , a partner at Cold Spark Media and former campaign manager for Sen. Patrick J. Toomey , Pennsylvania Republican , wrote in the July/August issue of Campaigns and Elections .\n\u201c If Twitter is your only news source , which too often it is for many political reporters , some random malfeasance would appear to have seismic repercussions when survey research would show 80 percent of voters are unaware of the issue at all , \u201d Mr. Harris said .\nIn terms of Facebook , it is trying to put an end to fake profiles and fake \u201c likes , \u201d understanding how misinformation and manipulation can spread .\nFacebook , in its annual report , estimated last year that 5.5 percent to 11.2 percent of its users were fake . In January , the company said at least 67.7 million fake accounts were used , a number that could be as high as 137.8 million deploying the company \u2019 s highest estimate .\nFacebook has vowed to \u201c aggressively get rid of fake likes \u201d on its network , according to an Oct. 4 posting on its security blog .\nThe site said it had won more than $ 2 billion against scam artists who sold fake likes in order to make a site seem more popular .\n\u201c We have a strong incentive to aggressively get rid of fake likes because businesses and people who use our platform want real connections and results , not fakes , \u201d Facebook \u2019 s security blog said . \u201c Fake likes are only profitable when they can spread at scale . To make it harder for these scams to be profitable , our abuse-fighting team builds and constantly updates a combination of automated and manual systems that help us catch suspicious activity at various points of interaction on the site , including registration , friending , liking , and messaging . \u201d\nThe social and digital battlefield has been set , and those running for office must be able to play , Mr. Levick said .\n\u201c The \u2018 aha \u2019 moment has not occurred yet for most politicians , \u201d said Mr. Levick . \u201c Fifteen years after the Model T was developed , buggy whips were still selling exceptionally well .
