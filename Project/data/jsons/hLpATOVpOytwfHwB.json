The \"Brexit\" vote stunned the country's political elite, the financial markets and British bookmakers, all of whom had expected a very close vote in favor of remaining in the European Union.\n\nInstead, Britain now finds itself in uncharted waters, and looking for a new captain. Prime Minister David Cameron, just days after vowing that \"Britain never quits,\" says he'll be stepping down by October.\n\n\"I fought this campaign in the only way I know how, which is to say directly and passionately what I think and feel, head, heart and soul,\" he said outside the prime minister's office at 10 Downing St.\n\n\"But the British people have made a very clear decision to take a different path, and as such I think the country requires fresh leadership to take it in this direction.\"\n\nCameron will stay on as a caretaker, but said a new prime minister should be in place by the time his Conservative Party holds a party conference in October.\n\nHow are financial markets reacting?\n\nThe British pound plunged to 31-year lows, stock markets around the world churned, and the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, stepped forward to reassure markets and bankers that nothing will be changing immediately. He said the Bank of England has 250 billion pounds in assistance at the ready, and will take all necessary measures to maintain market stability.\n\nHow will the U.K. and the EU divorce?\n\nThe vote itself does not immediately remove Britain from the EU, which is based in Brussels. The British government must notify the EU of its intention to withdraw from the union, which will trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, one of the EU's fundamental documents.\n\nArticle 50 envisions a two-year window to negotiate the terms of Britain's withdrawal, and to set in place whatever new agreements can be reached.

Cameron decided to hold the EU referendum because he thought it would be a way of getting the Euro-skeptics in his own party to \"stop banging on about Europe,\" as he once said.\n\nPhilip Cowley, professor of politics at Queen Mary College London University, said before the vote that \"it would be remarkable if someone who had taken the party back into power, then managed to win a majority against all odds, found himself kicked out within a year because he gambled on something he never wanted to do in the first place.\"\n\nThat prediction is now coming to pass.\n\nOther losers include Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn, who was roundly criticized for his \"half-hearted\" support of remaining in the EU.
