    "content": "There \u2019 s a surprisingly big disconnect between how obesity researchers think about the causes of and treatments for obesity and how the American public does .\nResearchers think some people have genetic and hormonal traits that make them more susceptible to obesity . They view obesity as a complex , chronic disease , like cancer , with many causes and subtypes . They \u2019 re also losing faith in dieting and exercise , neither of which is very helpful for weight loss in the long term .\nThe public , on the other hand , generally believes obesity is caused by a lack of willpower , and that it can be fixed with gym memberships and trendy diets . In one 2016 survey of more than 1,500 Americans , 60 percent of the participants said dieting and exercise were even more effective than surgery for long-term weight loss .\nHere \u2019 s the thing , though : Weight loss surgery is far and away medicine \u2019 s best treatment for severe obesity .\nThe medical case for bariatric surgery has grown much stronger in recent years . High quality studies on the long-term health outcomes of people with obesity who got surgery show , on average , that they \u2019 re able to lose dramatic amounts of weight , and even reverse or prevent their obesity-related health conditions , like diabetes and high cholesterol . A recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine demonstrated this once again . That \u2019 s why Medicaid now covers the procedure in 46 states , and so do national health systems in countries like Israel , Brazil , and Canada . It \u2019 s also why the American Academy of Pediatrics is now endorsing the operation as a \u201c safe and effective \u201d option for adolescents with severe obesity .\nYet out of the 20 million people who are eligible in the US , fewer than 1 percent get bariatric surgery for weight loss , according to the Obesity Society .\nWhy ? Polling data shows that many Americans still think it \u2019 s dangerous and ineffective .\nTo be clear , not all weight loss surgeries are created equal : The gastric bypass and gastric sleeve operations are considered superior to the lap band , for example . And surgery isn \u2019 t for people with a few pounds to lose ; it \u2019 s reserved for those with severe obesity . Even the best surgeries don \u2019 t work in some people and can cause disturbing side effects in rare cases . But bariatric surgery \u2019 s benefits appear to vastly outweigh its harms on average , and it is shaping up to be a genuine help for people struggling through one of the most urgent health crises of our time . It \u2019 s time we started paying attention .\nWeight loss surgeries work by reducing the size of the stomach and suppressing hormones related to hunger and satiety\nThe obesity crisis in America really began to take off in the 1970s . Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates from 2016 show that 40 percent of US adults and 19 percent of youth are obese .\nBut long before that , doctors were searching for ways to alter people \u2019 s bodies to help them eat less food .\nJaw wiring , which involved literally wiring the jaws shut to stop people from eating , was among the early approaches . In the 1950s , researchers noticed that shortening the small intestines of dogs hampered their ability to absorb calories and caused them to lose weight . By the late 1960s , bariatric surgery was being tried in humans . Surgeons \u2019 methods were crude at first but have vastly improved over the years . And some kinds of bariatric surgery ( most recently , the lap band approach ) have fallen out of favor .\nNow researchers are generating longer-term data showing some of the current surgical methods that can lead to dramatic and durable weight loss , and , even more remarkably , improvements in people \u2019 s long-term health outcomes .\nThe majority of bariatric procedures in America today involve the gastric sleeve and the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass . Both of these methods permanently alter the digestive tract to help people lose an average of about 30 percent of their original bodyweight ( and keep most of it off \u2014 more on that later ) .\nWith the sleeve , which now makes up more than 50 percent of weight loss surgeries in the US , surgeons staple off and remove about 80 percent of the stomach , transforming the organ from a wide football shape into a slim banana ( or sleeve ) shape . By reducing the size of the stomach , people can \u2019 t eat as much as they used to , so they consume fewer calories .\nWith the gastric bypass , surgeons use staples to make the stomach smaller by creating a small pouch , which can only hold about an ounce ( or walnut \u2019 s worth ) of food . Next , they reconnect the small intestine to a hole in the new pouch , so food flows into the pouch , bypassing most of the stomach , and then into the latter part of the small intestine , bypassing the first half of the intestine . Like the sleeve , the surgery also restricts the amount of food people can eat , but because food no longer passes through most of the stomach , people also can \u2019 t absorb as many calories and nutrients as they used to .\nBut an additional reason both the sleeve and gastric bypass surgeries lead to long-term weight loss is likely because of the changes in hormones that occur after these procedures . The sleeve , and especially the bypass , seems to suppress hormones that affect hunger and satiety , like the \u201c hunger hormone \u201d ghrelin \u2014 something no diet will ever do .\nAnother interesting possible reason for why the surgery works is that it may readjust the body \u2019 s metabolic rate , making maintaining weight loss easier .\nIn a 2014 study , published in the journal Obesity , researchers compared participants from the Biggest Loser reality TV show who had gone on crash diets and exercise programs to rapidly lose as much weight as possible to people who had gastric bypass surgery . ( They jumped on the chance to study reality show contestants because it \u2019 s so rare to see people with severe obesity lose vast amounts of weight in real life . ) The bypass surgery patients saw their metabolisms normalize within a year , to a rate that matched their new body size , while the TV show contestants saw their metabolisms slow down and stay that way \u2014 even six years after losing the weight and , on average , regaining much of it back .\nResearchers suspect this is because surgery may reset the \u201c set point , \u201d or the body \u2019 s habit of vigorously defending a certain weight range . Once a person gains weight and keeps that weight on for a period of time , the body gets used to its new , larger size . When a person loses weight , a bunch of subtle changes kick in \u2014 to the hormone levels , the brain \u2014 increasing appetite and slowing the metabolism , all in a seeming conspiracy to get back up to that set point weight .\nAmazingly , surgery seems to lower the set point , and even weaken the body \u2019 s desire to defend it . And that seems to make keeping weight off a little easier .\nNot all weight loss surgeries are equally effective . The lap band surgery is not a great weight loss surgery .\nThe third most common weight loss procedure in America is the lap band , though it has dramatically fallen out of favor in recent years and now only makes up about 5 percent of surgeries . The problem is the surgery doesn \u2019 t work as well for weight loss as the other procedures on offer , and it leads to many complications and more surgery .\nLap banding involves placing an inflatable band around the upper portion of the stomach to create a small pouch . When the lap band operation was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2001 , it seemed like a safe option for weight loss surgery that could be adjusted or removed at the patient \u2019 s behest . ( Unlike the gastric bypass or sleeve operations , it didn \u2019 t involve permanently altering the stomach or intestines \u2014 and it could be reversed by simply removing the device . )\nBut long-term data suggest lap band patients lose about half the amount of weight as bypass or sleeve patients . To be clear , even losing 10 percent of one \u2019 s bodyweight ( the average weight loss with lap banding ) can improve health outcomes , but it \u2019 s a lot less than the other weight loss surgeries . The lap band also turned out to be riskier than it seemed at first , often requiring additional surgeries .\nIn the best study we have on just how problematic lap band surgeries can be , published in JAMA , researchers from the University of Michigan looked at 16 years of Medicare data to see how common \u201c re-operations \u201d were after the first lap band procedure . These involved everything from removing the band to replacing it , fixing it , or following the initial procedure with another weight loss operation ( i.e. , the gastric bypass ) . They found 20 percent \u2014 or one in five \u2014 of the 25,000 lap band patients needed an additional procedure . That \u2019 s much higher than the 3 to 9 percent re-operation rate for the gastric bypass and gastric sleeve surgeries .\nResearchers think one reason the lap bands can fail is that they only restrict the size of the stomach , without producing the hormone and metabolic changes the sleeve and bypass do .\nPeople who get bypass or sleeve operations lose about a third of their original bodyweight on average \u2014 and keep most of it off\nIn the longer-term studies of both teens and adults who got sleeve and bypass surgeries , researchers found that people lose about a third of their original bodyweight on average and keep most of it off . So if someone weighs 300 pounds going into surgery , after a year they \u2019 ll probably weigh about 200 . But not all surgeries are created equal : The lap band is dramatically less effective than the sleeve or bypass . Let \u2019 s look at the evidence .\nAccording to a recent study , published in JAMA Surgery , researchers followed more than 1,000 adults for up to seven years and found bypass patients lost 28 percent of their original bodyweight ( including regaining about 4 percent of their weight loss between three and seven years ) . Band patients lost only 15 percent of their original bodyweight after seven years .\nIn another 2016 JAMA study , looking at the four-year weight change in veterans who underwent weight loss surgery , the bypass patients lost 27 percent of their original bodyweight , the gastric sleeve patients lost 17 percent , and again , lap band patients lost 10 percent .\nAnother systematic review from 2015 pooled the results of many studies on different weight loss operations and found the same trend : Band patients fared the worst when it came to weight loss , and gastric bypass patients the best .\nThe data on adolescents who get bariatric surgery looks similar . In a 2016 New England Journal of Medicine study , researchers followed 242 adolescents who got either gastric bypass surgery or the sleeve . After three years , sleeve patients lost 26 percent of their original bodyweight while bypass patients lost 28 percent . For a 2019 paper , also in NEJM , researchers compared the health outcomes of 161 teens and 396 adults for five years after their gastric bypass surgeries . Both groups lost around a third of their original bodyweight .\nAnother 2017 Lancet study followed 58 American teens for eight years who underwent gastric bypass . Again , teens lost an average of 30 percent of their bodyweight . That \u2019 s a similar finding to a study out of Sweden which tracked 81 teenagers with obesity who had a gastric bypass for five years . They lost about 28 percent of their original bodyweight .\nSo the data we have now suggests the surgery can be both safe and effective on average . But there \u2019 s still more researchers need to learn about the current surgical methods being used , in particular , their very long-term effects on people after more than a decade or two , and whether surgery continues to mitigate the effects of obesity \u2019 s toll .\nThere \u2019 s some variation in how much weight people lose after surgery , and no one knows why\nAs with every health intervention , there are some big caveats with weight loss surgery , too . One is that there \u2019 s some real variability in how people respond to it , and researchers have no way of predicting who will fare well and who won \u2019 t .\nThis 2018 JAMA Surgery study is a great example . The average weight loss after bypass was about 30 percent , and the majority of the study participants had lost and kept off between 20 and 30 percent of their bodyweight seven years after a bypass surgery . But there were outliers : 5 percent of the participants in the study lost as little as 10 percent of their original bodyweight , while 13 percent lost as much as 45 percent of their original weight .\nWhile researchers can \u2019 t tell who will succeed and who will fail before a surgery , they are learning people who do well have a few things in common . In the paper , the researchers found that people who lost more weight tended to be younger when they got the surgery . They also tended to be female and white , and had a higher body mass at the start of the study .\nIn another 2016 paper , looking at the variables that affected weight change after surgery , researchers found that people who adopted healthier eating habits lost the most weight . So it wasn \u2019 t just the surgery that helped people ; it was changes to their diet , too .\n\u201c Everyone is quite different in terms of how they lose weight and how much they lose over time , \u201d said Anita Courcoulas , a bariatric surgeon who was an author on both of these papers .\nShe thinks the reason is that there \u2019 s variability in the causes and subtypes of obesity among people , and that different people may need to be treated differently to get the best results . \u201c I think the important next step is figuring out how to understand the different subtypes of obesity , \u201d she said , \u201c instead of treating people like they \u2019 re one homogenous group. \u201d But we \u2019 re not there yet .\nThe other health benefits of surgery can be dramatic , including driving Type 2 diabetes into remission\nAside from the weight loss , the reason doctors get excited about bariatric surgery is that it seems to reduce the risk of a bunch of obesity-related diseases .\nCompared to obese adults who don \u2019 t get the surgery , bariatric patients live longer , have a lower risk of cancer , have less high blood pressure , have lower rates of Type 2 diabetes , and weigh significantly less .\nThe JAMA Surgery study offers some of the best evidence that these effects are durable over time . The study came out of LABS , the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery , a rigorous , multi-center study of bariatric patients that \u2019 s funded by the National Institutes of Health . Many bariatric studies have issues with people dropping out over time , which may bias the results . But the LABS researchers were able to follow up with more than 80 percent of the participants over seven years , which is rare in clinical medicine .\nAnd they found that all of the patients \u2019 health conditions \u2014 diabetes , high blood pressure , high cholesterol \u2014 were less prevalent seven years after surgery than they were before surgery . Sixty percent of the patients with Type 2 diabetes going in were still in remission seven years later . ( The same wasn \u2019 t true for the group that got the lap band . )\nThe newest NEJM study suggests teens may see these benefits even more : They were much more likely to experience remission of their diabetes and high blood pressure than adults .\nSurgery can cause complications and carry rare but disturbing side effects\nToday \u2019 s weight loss surgical techniques are a lot safer than they used to be \u2014 there \u2019 s a low rate of complications that \u2019 s similar to other abdominal operations , like gallbladder surgery . But the operations still carry a 0.3 percent mortality risk and other potential harms .\nThe most common long-term issue bariatric surgery patients face is nutritional deficiencies . Surgeries can hamper the body \u2019 s ability to absorb nutrients , so many of the people go on to develop iron , B12 , calcium , folate , and thiamine deficiencies . That \u2019 s why bariatric patients need to be closely monitored for the rest of their lives , to make sure they \u2019 re getting the vitamins they need and that they \u2019 re not developing any other health issues as a result .\nMany patients also need additional surgeries for surgical complications , or \u201c revision \u201d operations to address problems with their original surgeries . For example , patients who got the lap band may go back for a bypass after finding out the lap band didn \u2019 t work . And between 6 and 20 percent of bypass patients need to get treatment for stomal stenosis , which is when the new connection between the small stomach pouch and the intestine narrows and doctors have to go back in a stretch it out .\nThe sleeve is a simpler procedure and there tend to be fewer complications requiring surgery , but they can still happen . Up to 5 percent of sleeve patients experience gastric leaks , or a hole along the staple line of the newly created stomach , which allows stomach juices to leak into the abdominal cavity . Up to 17 percent of adults who have undergone a sleeve operation are later diagnosed with Barrett 's esophagus , a complication of acid reflux disease that can lead to cancer .\nFinally , some patients may opt for plastic surgery for loose , hanging skin \u2014 extra procedures that often aren \u2019 t covered by insurance .\nThen there are the rare but disturbing psychological effects that have surfaced in adults after bariatric surgery , including a slightly elevated post-surgical risk of self-harm , suicide , and drug and alcohol use disorders .\nResearchers still don \u2019 t understand why this happens , but they have some ideas they \u2019 re exploring . Because of the changes in the gut after bypass and sleeve operations , patients are more sensitive to the effects of drugs and alcohol .\n\u201c Any drug that peaks more quickly is more prone to abuse , \u201d said James Mitchell , a psychiatrist who studies bariatric surgery at the University of North Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences . So it \u2019 s possible that bariatric surgery may make alcohol and other drugs more addicting for some people .\nJunaid Bhatti , a Toronto-based researcher who has studied the link between suicide and bariatric surgery , said researchers are exploring whether this increased risk is caused by stress after surgery \u2014 the pressure to lose weight , the disappointment if you don \u2019 t . \u201c There is a subgroup of patients that may not be able to adjust well to the restrictions that come after surgery and if they have any previous mental health issue that may be provoked because of that stress following surgery , \u201d he explained . Or maybe there \u2019 s some other yet-to-be-discovered physiological change after surgery that explains it .\nThese two effects \u2014 the drug abuse and mental health issues \u2014 may work together in dangerous ways , Mitchell added . \u201c When people are intoxicated , they are disinhibited . If they are depressed and thinking about suicide , that \u2019 s not an uncommon time for them to act . So those two things may converge in a bad way that needs to be looked at in more detail . \u201d\nThere \u2019 s another nonmedical \u2014 but important \u2014 side effect of going under the knife for weight loss surgery : experiencing a change in relationship status . A study out of Sweden , published in JAMA Surgery , found people with spouses or live-in partners were more likely to separate or divorce after surgery compared to control groups who didn \u2019 t get surgery , while single patients were more likely to get into a relationship .\nThe new NEJM paper found these serious complications \u2014 nutrient deficiencies , self-harm , additional operations \u2014 may be more common in teens than adults . So there \u2019 s an urgent need to understand them .\nThen there are the important cost considerations . Without insurance , bariatric surgery can cost more than $ 20,000 . And that doesn \u2019 t include the cost of additional operations and follow-up care . So bariatric surgery isn \u2019 t necessarily going to make a big dent in America \u2019 s obesity-related costs , which add up to about $ 210 billion per year .\n\u201c The expectation is bariatric erases these obesity-associated costs , \u201d said David Arterburn , an obesity expert at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute , \u201c but because of the small complication rate and because complications are expensive \u2014 requiring hospitalization , reoperation \u2014 my take on the literature is that there \u2019 s no cost savings that happens from bariatric surgery . \u201d\nThe average patient with severe obesity uses between $ 5,000 and $ 10,000 in medical care per year , he said . Out of those total costs , about a third are associated with their obesity . The rest is related to other problems , like arthritis or high blood pressure that \u2019 s brought on by aging . Bariatric surgery can help cut the obesity-related costs , but not necessarily these other costs or the follow-up .\nEven so , bariatric surgery is considered \u201c cost-effective , \u201d meaning it \u2019 s as effective or better than similarly expensive interventions .\n\u201c Cost-effective treatments are considered somewhere between less than $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 per quality-adjusted life year saved [ QALY ] , \u201d explained Scott Kahan , director of the National Center for Weight and Wellness and a professor at George Washington University . \u201c Bariatric surgery is in the range of $ 50,000 per QALY. \u201d By comparison , annual Pap smear screenings are estimated at $ 800,000 per QALY , kidney dialysis $ 50,000 to $ 100,000 per QALY , and spinal fusion $ 250,000 per QALY .\n\u201c This is right in that sweet spot of we are spending a reasonable amount of money and getting a reasonable return , \u201d Kahan added .\nResearchers think the surgery could be even more cost-effective in adolescents \u2014 not only because they \u2019 ll likely experience greater health gains than adults ( since they \u2019 re young and many of their health problems are more reversible ) , but also because they \u2019 ll be better positioned to contribute to the economy if they \u2019 re unencumbered by severe obesity .\nPeople who want surgeries aren \u2019 t always able to get them\nAgain , fewer than 1 percent of people get bariatric surgery for weight loss . And researchers and obesity experts think there are several reasons for that .\nA lack of understanding about obesity and obesity-related stigma may hold both doctors and patients back from considering surgery . \u201c There \u2019 s an attitude that people are at fault for their obesity , that it \u2019 s failure or personal responsibility , \u201d said Joe Nadglowski of the Obesity Action Coalition , a membership organization for people with obesity . \u201c Not only is having obesity something you \u2019 re stigmatized for but if you need a medical intervention , there \u2019 s a stigma around needing help to deal with it. \u201d So doctors may think patients can exercise their way out of the problem , and patients may feel they should be able to , too .\nIn a seminal 1991 study , researchers asked patients who had lost about 100 pounds after surgery to choose between regaining their weight or maintaining their new body size at the cost of living with another disability . The patients opted for deafness , blindness , heart disease , even losing a limb , instead of returning to their morbid obesity .\nInsurance coverage is \u201c all over the place , \u201d Kahan said . Though many providers cover the surgery , copays can be high , and insurers often don \u2019 t pay for follow-up operations or plastic surgeries that are needed later . \u201c Even when there is coverage , it \u2019 s quasi-coverage , \u201d he added . \u201c Copays can range from hundreds of dollars to over $ 10,000 in some policies . For some patients , surgeries are exempt from out-of-pocket maximums . \u201d\nMany doctors still don \u2019 t know the basic requirements for bariatric surgery recommendation and may not be referring patients who could benefit from surgery , he added . In a 2007 survey of nearly 500 doctors , 91 percent referred their severely obese patients to exercise , with diet following closely behind . The least recommended weight loss treatment was bariatric surgery , prescribed for only 15 of the doctors \u2019 morbidly obese patients .\nWe can \u2019 t cut our way out of the obesity epidemic\nAlmost all the researchers I spoke to for this story said they hoped to one day find a pill that could do for obesity what surgery does . But until then , surgery is the best thing we have for the treatment of obesity . That doesn \u2019 t mean it \u2019 s the answer to the obesity epidemic , however .\n\u201c The obesity epidemic did not occur because we don \u2019 t have enough surgery , \u201d said National Institutes of Health obesity researcher Kevin Hall . \u201c The obesity epidemic occurred because the food environment has changed remarkably . \u201d\nThere \u2019 s no question that our food landscape has increased the opportunities for obesity-related genes and traits to express themselves . Preventing future obesity cases will require making it easier for people to eat healthfully and be more active . But there \u2019 s still the problem about what to do for the people who are struggling with severe obesity right now .\n\u201c [ Surgery ] is an incredibly valuable tool right now for treating adults with [ severe ] obesity , \u201d Hall added , \u201c but we \u2019 re not going to cut our way out of the obesity epidemic . \u201d",

The lap band surgery is not a great weight loss surgery.\n\nThe third most common weight loss procedure in America is the lap band, though it has dramatically fallen out of favor in recent years and now only makes up about 5 percent of surgeries. The problem is the surgery doesn\u2019t work as well for weight loss as the other procedures on offer, and it leads to many complications and more surgery.\n\nLap banding involves placing an inflatable band around the upper portion of the stomach to create a small pouch. When the lap band operation was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2001, it seemed like a safe option for weight loss surgery that could be adjusted or removed at the patient\u2019s behest. (Unlike the gastric bypass or sleeve operations, it didn\u2019t involve permanently altering the stomach or intestines \u2014 and it could be reversed by simply removing the device.)\n\nBut long-term data suggest lap band patients lose about half the amount of weight as bypass or sleeve patients. To be clear, even losing 10 percent of one\u2019s bodyweight (the average weight loss with lap banding) can improve health outcomes, but it\u2019s a lot less than the other weight loss surgeries. The lap band also turned out to be riskier than it seemed at first, often requiring additional surgeries.\n\nIn the best study we have on just how problematic lap band surgeries can be, published in JAMA, researchers from the University of Michigan looked at 16 years of Medicare data to see how common \u201cre-operations\u201d were after the first lap band procedure. These involved everything from removing the band to replacing it, fixing it, or following the initial procedure with another weight loss operation (i.e., the gastric bypass). They found 20 percent \u2014 or one in five \u2014 of the 25,000 lap band patients needed an additional procedure. That\u2019s much higher than the 3 to 9 percent re-operation rate for the gastric bypass and gastric sleeve surgeries.\n\nResearchers think one reason the lap bands can fail is that they only restrict the size of the stomach, without producing the hormone and metabolic changes the sleeve and bypass do.\n\nPeople who get bypass or sleeve operations lose about a third of their original bodyweight on average \u2014 and keep most of it off\n\nIn the longer-term studies of both teens and adults who got sleeve and bypass surgeries, researchers found that people lose about a third of their original bodyweight on average and keep most of it off. So if someone weighs 300 pounds going into surgery, after a year they\u2019ll probably weigh about 200. But not all surgeries are created equal: The lap band is dramatically less effective than the sleeve or bypass. Let\u2019s look at the evidence.\n\nAccording to a recent study, published in JAMA Surgery, researchers followed more than 1,000 adults for up to seven years and found bypass patients lost 28 percent of their original bodyweight (including regaining about 4 percent of their weight loss between three and seven years). Band patients lost only 15 percent of their original bodyweight after seven years.\n\nIn another 2016 JAMA study, looking at the four-year weight change in veterans who underwent weight loss surgery, the bypass patients lost 27 percent of their original bodyweight, the gastric sleeve patients lost 17 percent, and again, lap band patients lost 10 percent.\n\nAnother systematic review from 2015 pooled the results of many studies on different weight loss operations and found the same trend: Band patients fared the worst when it came to weight loss, and gastric bypass patients the best.\n\nThe data on adolescents who get bariatric surgery looks similar. In a 2016 New England Journal of Medicine study, researchers followed 242 adolescents who got either gastric bypass surgery or the sleeve. After three years, sleeve patients lost 26 percent of their original bodyweight while bypass patients lost 28 percent. For a 2019 paper, also in NEJM, researchers compared the health outcomes of 161 teens and 396 adults for five years after their gastric bypass surgeries. Both groups lost around a third of their original bodyweight.\n\nAnother 2017 Lancet study followed 58 American teens for eight years who underwent gastric bypass. Again, teens lost an average of 30 percent of their bodyweight. That\u2019s a similar finding to a study out of Sweden which tracked 81 teenagers with obesity who had a gastric bypass for five years. They lost about 28 percent of their original bodyweight.\n\nSo the data we have now suggests the surgery can be both safe and effective on average. But there\u2019s still more researchers need to learn about the current surgical methods being used, in particular, their very long-term effects on people after more than a decade or two, and whether surgery continues to mitigate the effects of obesity\u2019s toll.\n\nThere\u2019s some variation in how much weight people lose after surgery, and no one knows why\n\nAs with every health intervention, there are some big caveats with weight loss surgery, too. One is that there\u2019s some real variability in how people respond to it, and researchers have no way of predicting who will fare well and who won\u2019t.\n\nThis 2018 JAMA Surgery study is a great example. The average weight loss after bypass was about 30 percent, and the majority of the study participants had lost and kept off between 20 and 30 percent of their bodyweight seven years after a bypass surgery. But there were outliers: 5 percent of the participants in the study lost as little as 10 percent of their original bodyweight, while 13 percent lost as much as 45 percent of their original weight.\n\nWhile researchers can\u2019t tell who will succeed and who will fail before a surgery, they are learning people who do well have a few things in common. In the paper, the researchers found that people who lost more weight tended to be younger when they got the surgery. They also tended to be female and white, and had a higher body mass at the start of the study.\n\nIn another 2016 paper, looking at the variables that affected weight change after surgery, researchers found that people who adopted healthier eating habits lost the most weight. So it wasn\u2019t just the surgery that helped people; it was changes to their diet, too.\n\n\u201cEveryone is quite different in terms of how they lose weight and how much they lose over time,\u201d said Anita Courcoulas, a bariatric surgeon who was an author on both of these papers.\n\nShe thinks the reason is that there\u2019s variability in the causes and subtypes of obesity among people, and that different people may need to be treated differently to get the best results. \u201cI think the important next step is figuring out how to understand the different subtypes of obesity,\u201d she said, \u201cinstead of treating people like they\u2019re one homogenous group.\u201d But we\u2019re not there yet.\n\nThe other health benefits of surgery can be dramatic, including driving Type 2 diabetes into remission\n\nAside from the weight loss, the reason doctors get excited about bariatric surgery is that it seems to reduce the risk of a bunch of obesity-related diseases.\n\nCompared to obese adults who don\u2019t get the surgery, bariatric patients live longer, have a lower risk of cancer, have less high blood pressure, have lower rates of Type 2 diabetes, and weigh significantly less.\n\nThe JAMA Surgery study offers some of the best evidence that these effects are durable over time. The study came out of LABS, the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery, a rigorous, multi-center study of bariatric patients that\u2019s funded by the National Institutes of Health. Many bariatric studies have issues with people dropping out over time, which may bias the results. But the LABS researchers were able to follow up with more than 80 percent of the participants over seven years, which is rare in clinical medicine.\n\nAnd they found that all of the patients\u2019 health conditions \u2014 diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol \u2014 were less prevalent seven years after surgery than they were before surgery. Sixty percent of the patients with Type 2 diabetes going in were still in remission seven years later. (The same wasn\u2019t true for the group that got the lap band.)\n\nThe newest NEJM study suggests teens may see these benefits even more: They were much more likely to experience remission of their diabetes and high blood pressure than adults.\n\nSurgery can cause complications and carry rare but disturbing side effects\n\nToday\u2019s weight loss surgical techniques are a lot safer than they used to be \u2014 there\u2019s a low rate of complications that\u2019s similar to other abdominal operations, like gallbladder surgery. But the operations still carry a 0.3 percent mortality risk and other potential harms.\n\nThe most common long-term issue bariatric surgery patients face is nutritional deficiencies. Surgeries can hamper the body\u2019s ability to absorb nutrients, so many of the people go on to develop iron, B12, calcium, folate, and thiamine deficiencies. That\u2019s why bariatric patients need to be closely monitored for the rest of their lives, to make sure they\u2019re getting the vitamins they need and that they\u2019re not developing any other health issues as a result.\n\nMany patients also need additional surgeries for surgical complications, or \u201crevision\u201d operations to address problems with their original surgeries. For example, patients who got the lap band may go back for a bypass after finding out the lap band didn\u2019t work. And between 6 and 20 percent of bypass patients need to get treatment for stomal stenosis, which is when the new connection between the small stomach pouch and the intestine narrows and doctors have to go back in a stretch it out.\n\nThe sleeve is a simpler procedure and there tend to be fewer complications requiring surgery, but they can still happen. Up to 5 percent of sleeve patients experience gastric leaks, or a hole along the staple line of the newly created stomach, which allows stomach juices to leak into the abdominal cavity. Up to 17 percent of adults who have undergone a sleeve operation are later diagnosed with Barrett's esophagus, a complication of acid reflux disease that can lead to cancer.\n\nFinally, some patients may opt for plastic surgery for loose, hanging skin \u2014 extra procedures that often aren\u2019t covered by insurance.\n\nThen there are the rare but disturbing psychological effects that have surfaced in adults after bariatric surgery, including a slightly elevated post-surgical risk of self-harm, suicide, and drug and alcohol use disorders.\n\nResearchers still don\u2019t understand why this happens, but they have some ideas they\u2019re exploring. Because of the changes in the gut after bypass and sleeve operations, patients are more sensitive to the effects of drugs and alcohol.\n\n\u201cAny drug that peaks more quickly is more prone to abuse,\u201d said James Mitchell, a psychiatrist who studies bariatric surgery at the University of North Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences. So it\u2019s possible that bariatric surgery may make alcohol and other drugs more addicting for some people.\n\nJunaid Bhatti, a Toronto-based researcher who has studied the link between suicide and bariatric surgery, said researchers are exploring whether this increased risk is caused by stress after surgery \u2014 the pressure to lose weight, the disappointment if you don\u2019t. \u201cThere is a subgroup of patients that may not be able to adjust well to the restrictions that come after surgery and if they have any previous mental health issue that may be provoked because of that stress following surgery,\u201d he explained. Or maybe there\u2019s some other yet-to-be-discovered physiological change after surgery that explains it.\n\nThese two effects \u2014 the drug abuse and mental health issues \u2014 may work together in dangerous ways, Mitchell added. \u201cWhen people are intoxicated, they are disinhibited. If they are depressed and thinking about suicide, that\u2019s not an uncommon time for them to act. So those two things may converge in a bad way that needs to be looked at in more detail.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s another nonmedical \u2014 but important \u2014 side effect of going under the knife for weight loss surgery: experiencing a change in relationship status. A study out of Sweden, published in JAMA Surgery, found people with spouses or live-in partners were more likely to separate or divorce after surgery compared to control groups who didn\u2019t get surgery, while single patients were more likely to get into a relationship.\n\nThe new NEJM paper found these serious complications \u2014 nutrient deficiencies, self-harm, additional operations \u2014 may be more common in teens than adults. So there\u2019s an urgent need to understand them.\n\nBariatric surgery isn\u2019t necessarily cost-saving. But it\u2019s cost-effective.\n\nThen there are the important cost considerations. Without insurance, bariatric surgery can cost more than $20,000. And that doesn\u2019t include the cost of additional operations and follow-up care. So bariatric surgery isn\u2019t necessarily going to make a big dent in America\u2019s obesity-related costs, which add up to about $210 billion per year.\n\n\u201cThe expectation is bariatric erases these obesity-associated costs,\u201d said David Arterburn, an obesity expert at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute, \u201cbut because of the small complication rate and because complications are expensive \u2014 requiring hospitalization, reoperation \u2014 my take on the literature is that there\u2019s no cost savings that happens from bariatric surgery.\u201d\n\nThe average patient with severe obesity uses between $5,000 and $10,000 in medical care per year, he said. Out of those total costs, about a third are associated with their obesity. The rest is related to other problems, like arthritis or high blood pressure that\u2019s brought on by aging. Bariatric surgery can help cut the obesity-related costs, but not necessarily these other costs or the follow-up.\n\nEven so, bariatric surgery is considered \u201ccost-effective,\u201d meaning it\u2019s as effective or better than similarly expensive interventions.\n\n\u201cCost-effective treatments are considered somewhere between less than $50,000 to $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year saved [QALY],\u201d explained Scott Kahan, director of the National Center for Weight and Wellness and a professor at George Washington University. \u201cBariatric surgery is in the range of $50,000 per QALY.\u201d By comparison, annual Pap smear screenings are estimated at $800,000 per QALY, kidney dialysis $50,000 to $100,000 per QALY, and spinal fusion $250,000 per QALY.\n\n\u201cThis is right in that sweet spot of we are spending a reasonable amount of money and getting a reasonable return,\u201d Kahan added.\n\nResearchers think the surgery could be even more cost-effective in adolescents \u2014 not only because they\u2019ll likely experience greater health gains than adults (since they\u2019re young and many of their health problems are more reversible), but also because they\u2019ll be better positioned to contribute to the economy if they\u2019re unencumbered by severe obesity.\n\nPeople who want surgeries aren\u2019t always able to get them\n\nAgain, fewer than 1 percent of people get bariatric surgery for weight loss. And researchers and obesity experts think there are several reasons for that.\n\nA lack of understanding about obesity and obesity-related stigma may hold both doctors and patients back from considering surgery. \u201cThere\u2019s an attitude that people are at fault for their obesity, that it\u2019s failure or personal responsibility,\u201d said Joe Nadglowski of the Obesity Action Coalition, a membership organization for people with obesity. \u201cNot only is having obesity something you\u2019re stigmatized for but if you need a medical intervention, there\u2019s a stigma around needing help to deal with it.\u201d So doctors may think patients can exercise their way out of the problem, and patients may feel they should be able to, too.\n\nIn a seminal 1991 study, researchers asked patients who had lost about 100 pounds after surgery to choose between regaining their weight or maintaining their new body size at the cost of living with another disability. The patients opted for deafness, blindness, heart disease, even losing a limb, instead of returning to their morbid obesity.\n\nInsurance coverage is \u201call over the place,\u201d Kahan said. Though many providers cover the surgery, copays can be high, and insurers often don\u2019t pay for follow-up operations or plastic surgeries that are needed later. \u201cEven when there is coverage, it\u2019s quasi-coverage,\u201d he added. \u201cCopays can range from hundreds of dollars to over $10,000 in some policies. For some patients, surgeries are exempt from out-of-pocket maximums.\u201d\n\nMany doctors still don\u2019t know the basic requirements for bariatric surgery recommendation and may not be referring patients who could benefit from surgery, he added. In a 2007 survey of nearly 500 doctors, 91 percent referred their severely obese patients to exercise, with diet following closely behind. The least recommended weight loss treatment was bariatric surgery, prescribed for only 15 of the doctors\u2019 morbidly obese patients.\n\nWe can\u2019t cut our way out of the obesity epidemic\n\nAlmost all the researchers I spoke to for this story said they hoped to one day find a pill that could do for obesity what surgery does. But until then, surgery is the best thing we have for the treatment of obesity. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the answer to the obesity epidemic, however.\n\n\u201cThe obesity epidemic did not occur because we don\u2019t have enough surgery,\u201d said National Institutes of Health obesity researcher Kevin Hall. \u201cThe obesity epidemic occurred because the food environment has changed remarkably.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no question that our food landscape has increased the opportunities for obesity-related genes and traits to express themselves. Preventing future obesity cases will require making it easier for people to eat healthfully and be more active. But there\u2019s still the problem about what to do for the people who are struggling with severe obesity right now.\n\n\u201c[Surgery] is an incredibly valuable tool right now for treating adults with [severe] obesity,\u201d Hall added, \u201cbut we\u2019re not going to cut our way out of the obesity epidemic.\u201d",
