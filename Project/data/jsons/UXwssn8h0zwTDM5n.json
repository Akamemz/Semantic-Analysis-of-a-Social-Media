Terror suspect: 5 legal questions\n\nWith Dzhokhar Tsarnaev taken alive, the focus now turns to how the Obama administration is going to seek to bring the Boston Marathon bombing suspect to justice.\n\nLawyers have already made one potentially critical decision: He hasn\u2019t been read his Miranda rights, at least for now. This means that FBI investigators may have a shot at trying to question him about other potential plots he may be aware of and whether anyone other than his deceased brother was involved in last Monday\u2019s bombing or Thursday night\u2019s crime spree.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut if Tsarnaev\u2019s injuries leave him incapacitated for a protracted period of time, the Miranda issue may be of less significance.\n\n( PHOTOS: Boston celebrates capture)\n\nAs soon as he\u2019s coherent, he\u2019s likely to go before a judge or magistrate, even in the hospital. The judicial officer will formally advise Tsarnaev of the preliminary charges used to detain him and tell of his right to an attorney, even if investigators haven\u2019t done that by then.\n\nOn Sunday, Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis said Tsarnaev was still in stable but serious condition and has not been questioned yet. \u201cHe\u2019s in no condition to be interrogated at this point in time,\u201d Davis said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s progressing, though, and we\u2019re monitoring the situation carefully.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Pols celebrate, reflect on capture)\n\nOne tricky issue now is how prosecutors and the FBI will balance the duty to get Tsarnaev before a judge promptly with their desire to do the initial public-safety interview.\n\nMeanwhile, a host of other questions are already bubbling up, from whether he\u2019ll be tried in civilian or military court to whether he\u2019ll face the death penalty for crimes that include killing three people in the explosions and a police officer on the MIT campus.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Obama praises arrest in Boston blasts)\n\nHere\u2019s POLITICO\u2019s guide to the five key questions \u2014 and what\u2019s known about the answers \u2014 that are ahead.\n\n1. Why does the Miranda issue matter?\n\nAfter the Justice Department decided not to immediately read Tsarnaev his Miranda rights, a debate broke out among lawmakers, lawyers and political activists over whether the suspect, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, should be prosecuted in a civilian criminal court or subjected to military interrogation \u2014 and over when and whether Tsarnaev should be told about his right to an attorney.\n\n\u201cNo Miranda warning to be given\u201d now, a Justice official told POLITICO Friday. \u201cThe government will be invoking the public safety exception.\u201d\n\nThat may increase the possibility that Tsarnaev will quickly offer up information about whether he and his brother, who was killed in a shootout Thursday, acted alone in the bombings or whether they were directed, supported or trained by forces abroad.\n\nBeginning several hours before Dzhokhar Tsarnaev\u2019s capture, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) wrote on Twitter that the suspect ought to be placed in military custody.\n\n\u201cIf captured, I hope Administration will at least consider holding the Boston suspect as enemy combatant for intelligence gathering purposes,\u201d Graham wrote Friday afternoon. \u201cThe last thing we may want to do is read Boston suspect Miranda Rights telling him to \u2018remain silent.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Law of War allows us to hold individual in this scenario as potential enemy combatant w/o Miranda warnings or appointment of counsel,\u201d the senator added later in the evening. \u201cI hope the Obama Administration will seriously consider this option \u2026 The goal is to gather intelligence and protect our nation which is under threat from radical Islam.\u201d\n\n\u201cNBC reporting Obama admin will treat terrorist as a \u2018criminal\u2019 and not enemy combatant,\u201d former State Department official Liz Cheney wrote on Twitter Friday night. \u201cWill Obama allow him to lawyer up?\u201d",
