    "content": "-- The percent of Americans unable to find work , forced to take part-time work or who have given up looking work in the month of June , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics . The rate has been essentially steady since February .\nThe June jobs report looks a lot like the one from May . Anemic jobs growth that not only falls short of expectations but also falls short of the number needed to accommodate young job seekers entering the economy .\nIt takes something like 125,000 new jobs a month to keep pace with population growth . With only 80,000 jobs added in June , the economy is at best stagnating and may be getting ready to take another tumble . Dipping corporate profits , weak manufacturing and sagging consumer confidence all suggest that a recessionary round could be ahead .\nThis is an unfortunate moment for the president to be on a Rust Belt bus trip . Obama has a complex rationale as to why the dreadful condition of the economy is the fault of Republicans , but getting that to stick when things are so bad is no easy task .\nBut here \u2019 s the biggest test for Obama : Can he resist trying to make that argument today . Trying to explain why last month \u2019 s bad number wasn \u2019 t so bad , Obama fumbled the ball and said that the private sector was \u201c doing fine . \u201d\nThis month \u2019 s jobs number would have been 4,000 better had it not been for continued layoffs from state and local governments . As the spending from Obama \u2019 s two stimuli for government payrolls expire , governments are being forced to scale back .\nObama sees this as evidence for the need for his long-standing call for more government payroll stimulus funded by higher taxes on top earners . In a report so bad , those 4,000 jobs wouldn \u2019 t have made much difference , but seeing the private sector adding any jobs and the public sector shrinking is a great frustration for Obama Democrats .\nObama has been relentlessly on message since he first hit the campaign trail in full fashion last fall : What he did is working but it would be working faster if Republicans allowed another round of government payroll stimulus and increased taxes . Obama says the country should stay the current course , but travel faster .\nBut given that his challenger \u2019 s primary point of prosecution is that Obama himself made the recovery weaker and slower with bad policies , the president might not be able to hold the line indefinitely .\nIn economics , bad news often begets bad news . Today \u2019 s big bad news could add fuel to the recessionary fires now burning around the world .\nObama might be able to go out today and tout \u201c another month of job growth \u201d and call for more government payroll stimulus , but the time may soon come that the incumbent needs to acknowledge deepening fears among his constituents and offer a new line of argument .\nAs he continues his two-day trip through Ohio and Pennsylvania , Obama will celebrate bailouts and government spending as the keys to having prevented a depression . Even if they credit him with that , voters might still come to believe that his policies are responsible for the current stagnation .\n\u201c Are you abandoning a principle that you fought for , for six years simply because you 're getting pressure for two days from Rush Limbaugh or some critics in Washington ? \u201d\n-- President Obama in an interview with Cincinnati NBC affiliate WLWT .\nMitt Romney reportedly raised more money in June than any Republican presidential candidate ever has in a single month \u2013 cresting above the $ 100 million mark and almost certainly substantially out-raising President Obama .\nRomney is in a dead heat with Obama in polls nationally and swing-state polls show the race very much within reach for the challenger .\nSo why , then , are there so many crabby Republicans ? The man who conservatives said would get rolled over by Obama is more than holding his own . Ought the right be pleasantly surprised ?\nFrom Bill Kristol to John Sununu , the criticism of Romney \u2019 s campaign response to last week \u2019 s Supreme Court ruling on Obama \u2019 s 2010 health law have been stinging .\nRomney came out of the gate strongly with a tough speech just hours after the law was upheld , promising to use the public opposition to the law to uproot Obama .\nBut when congressional Republicans seized on a key element in the decision -- the re-writing of the law to define the penalty for those who do not comply with the requirement to purchase private insurance as a new tax , not a fine \u2013 Team Romney got squirmy .\nOn Monday , Romney message man Eric Fehrnstrom told MSNBC that he didn \u2019 t agree . The motive here was pretty clear : to spare Romney from more attacks that he raised taxes while governing Massachusetts . If the insurance mandate is a tax in Washington , then it is in Boston too .\nTwo days later , Romney settled the hash , telling CBS that yes , the mandate is a tax .\nBut this effort at a gap shot by Ferhnstrom reinforced concerns among conservatives about Romney \u2019 s nuanced approach to campaigning .\nRomney won the GOP nomination by playing rope-a-dope with a string of aggressive challengers , letting them wear themselves out and then knocking them over with quick , strong punches . Michele Bachmann , Rick Perry , Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum warned , even as they were being cut to ribbons , that what was working in the primaries would not work against Obama .\nFor supporters of those challengers , there is huge eagerness to find evidence of these claims here in the general election . No matter how much these voters would like to see Obama defeated , \u201c I told you so \u201d is among the most satisfying sentences that can be uttered .\nSo when these folks see Romney doing anything equivocal or Fehrnstrom using tortured terminology , the cry rises up on the right .
