Although the country has managed to slightly reduce its prison population in recent years , mass incarceration remains a fact of the US criminal justice system .\nIt \u2019 s time for a radical idea that could really begin to reverse mass incarceration : capping all prison sentences at no more than 20 years . It may sound like an extreme , even dangerous , proposal , but there \u2019 s good reason to believe it would help reduce the prison population without making America any less safe .\nIn the 1980s and \u2019 90s , American officials by and large believed the country was in the middle of a crime wave and an underincarceration crisis ; they responded by increasing the length of prison sentences , enacting new mandatory minimums , and restricting the use of parole . Today , with crime rates lower , Americans more readily believe that the country has an overincarceration problem \u2014 one that disproportionately afflicts minority communities , as black and brown people are far more likely to be locked up than their white peers .\nGiven the impact that mass incarceration has had , there \u2019 s a strong case that the US should take steps to ensure that it doesn \u2019 t ever lock up so many people again .\nLooking at the length of our prison sentences is one approach to reverse mass incarceration . Empirical research has consistently found that locking up people for very long periods of time does little to nothing to combat crime , and may actually lead to more crime as people spend more time in prison \u2014 missing big life opportunities for legitimate careers , and being incarcerated with others who have ties to the criminal world .\nThere \u2019 s also good reason to believe that 20 years is a good cutoff for a maximum . Studies have found that people almost always age out of crime , particularly by their late 30s and 40s . If a person is locked up for a robbery or murder at 21 , there \u2019 s a very good chance that he won \u2019 t commit that same crime when he gets out at 41 .\nOther countries show this can work . European nations tend to have shorter prison sentences than the US , and certainly fewer people in prison , along with roughly equal or lower violent crime rates . Norway in particular caps the great majority of prison sentences at 21 years \u2014 and its violent crime and reoffending rates are lower than the US \u2019 s . ( The cap does have some exceptions , as I \u2019 ll explain later . )\nA cap on prison sentences wouldn \u2019 t on its own end mass incarceration . But at least tens of thousands of people in prison would benefit now \u2014 if the change were applied retroactively \u2014 and untold numbers more would benefit in the future if it were adopted by states and the federal government .\nI \u2019 m not naive ; I know there \u2019 s a very , very low chance that this policy will actually be enacted . And I know there are some difficult questions we need to confront if such a policy were ever put in place .\nBut I think pushing for something like this is a good idea anyway . It forces a conversation about what prisons are for : Are they for keeping the public safe ? Rehabilitating inmates ? Purely for revenge ? If our answer as a society is the first two , but not the latter , then a cap is something we should consider .\nBy beginning these kinds of conversations , we can try to get at the root cultural and social forces that enabled and encouraged mass incarceration to begin with . Only by doing that can we start to really unravel a criminal justice system that \u2019 s turned into one of the world \u2019 s most punitive .\nCapping prison sentences at 20 years \u2014 an idea that I first heard from Sentencing Project executive director Marc Mauer \u2014 is a really consequential policy change that could affect the lives of up to hundreds of thousands of people .\nAmerica \u2019 s prison population has exploded , from 330,000 in 1980 to 1.5 million in 2016 ( though the figures have started to turn since 2009 ) . That includes at least tens of thousands of people who are likely to spend decades in prison .\nIn The Meaning of Life : The Case for Abolishing Life Sentences , Mauer and Ashley Nellis wrote that the number of people sentenced to prison for life grew from 34,000 in 1984 to nearly 162,000 in 2016 . The US is a huge outlier , Mauer and Nellis explained : \u201c A comprehensive 2016 international analysis of life imprisonment found that the number of people serving life imprisonment in the United States is higher than the combined total in the other 113 countries surveyed . \u201d\nThe idea for a cap is straightforward : No one could be sentenced for any number of charges \u2014 not attempted robbery , rape , or murder \u2014 for more than 20 years . There should be a limited exception , like there is in Norway , that lets courts extend prison sentences indefinitely for an additional five years at a time , but only if there \u2019 s proof that a person still poses a public safety threat .\nFor a lot of people , this is going to sound ridiculous . Twenty years for murder or rape ? That doesn \u2019 t seem proportional to the crime .\nBut this gets us to a deeper conversation about the criminal justice system \u2019 s purpose . Is it for punishment ? Is it for public safety ? Is it for rehabilitation ? Is it for all of the above , or something else entirely ?\nMy guess is for those who believe prison should punish offenders , a cap is going to be really hard to swallow . The great , great majority of people who would benefit from this change are violent criminals who have absolutely done bad things . There \u2019 s no denying that . Americans may want those people to suffer .\nBut I think those views need to be reconsidered . Even without a cap , the majority of people in prison will be released and reenter society at some point . When we have those people literally captive , why not take the opportunity to try to make sure they can be productive members of society when they return ? Why waste the potential of any human life if we have a chance , small or large , to turn it around ?\nAnd 20 years in prison is still a very long time , so people sentenced at the cap would still suffer . Mauer told me he tries to get people to think about what it \u2019 d be like to serve such a long sentence .\n\u201c Think back where you were in life 10 years ago , \u201d he said . \u201c What \u2019 s happened to you ? What experiences have you had in 10 years ? You might have gotten married or divorced . You might have had children . You might have had different jobs . You might have had health problems . Think through all the things that go through your life , and that \u2019 s a small window into what incarceration does . \u201d\nTo me , that seems like a terrible punishment \u2014 even if I think it \u2019 s deserved .\nWhy this can work without hurting public safety : people age out of crime\nWhat about the public safety case against capping prison sentences ? Won \u2019 t a released murderer , rapist , or robber just go on to victimize more people ?\nThis concern , while genuine , misunderstands people \u2019 s propensity to commit crime throughout their lives . Most murderers aren \u2019 t serial killers , and they aren \u2019 t very likely , especially decades later , to kill again . The same goes for other crimes .\nThe evidence is what \u2019 s known as the age-crime curve . It shows that people tend to age out of crime . In their mid- to late teens and early 20s , people are much , much likelier to commit a crime than they are in their 30s and especially 40s and on .\nHere \u2019 s the age-crime curve for robbery in 2014 , taken from Mauer and Nellis \u2019 s book :\nAs the chart makes clear , a person \u2019 s propensity to commit a crime \u2014 in this case , a robbery \u2014 is at its highest around 20 years old . But it drops quickly after that . In his 30s , a person \u2019 s chances of committing a robbery drop to 25 percent of what they were at 20 . In his 40s , the chances drop to less than 12.5 percent . In his 60s , the risk nearly vanishes .\nThere are exceptions , like lifelong serial killers . But they \u2019 re few and far between , and could be handled with limited exceptions to a 20-year cap .\nVirtually no one in criminology disputes the age-crime curve . Nancy La Vigne , vice president of justice policy at the Urban Institute , told me that it \u2019 s \u201c pretty well established in the literature . \u201d\nThis shouldn \u2019 t come as a surprise to most people , particularly those already in their 30s , 40s , or above . Think about how likely you were as a teen to break the law , with underage drinking , using illegal drugs , shoplifting , getting into fights , and so on . Now think about how likely you are to do that today , assuming you \u2019 re older . Regardless of whether you got caught in your teen years , you are likely an embodiment of the age-crime curve .\nJohn Pfaff , a criminal justice expert at Fordham University and the author of Locked In : The True Causes of Mass Incarceration and How to Achieve Real Reform , told me there are a few reasons for the age-crime curve .\n\u201c Some of it is physical and hormonal : Testosterone levels go up , testosterone levels go down ; violence goes up , violence goes down . Some of it is purely physical : Even if I was as aggressive now as I was 20 years ago , I \u2019 m 44 \u2014 things are slow , things ache a bit more , \u201d he explained . \u201c But some of it is also social : Getting married is a pathway out of crime ; finding a career is a pathway out of crime . So the longer we keep people in prison , the longer we tend to undermine the ways these people mature and age out of crime as they get older . \u201d\nOther evidence backs this up . In 2017 , David Roodman of the Open Philanthropy Project conducted an extensive review of the research on longer prison sentences . He concluded that \u201c tougher sentences hardly deter crime , and that while imprisoning people temporarily stops them from committing crime outside prison walls , it also tends to increase their criminality after release . As a result , \u2018 tough-on-crime \u2019 initiatives can reduce crime in the short run but cause offsetting harm in the long run . \u201d\nThere \u2019 s also evidence that America \u2019 s mass incarceration experiment has not done much to make the US safer . A 2015 research review by the Brennan Center for Justice estimated that more incarceration \u2014 and its abilities to incapacitate or deter criminals \u2014 explained about zero to 7 percent of the crime drop since the 1990s , although other researchers estimate it drove 10 to 25 percent of the crime drop since the \u2019 90s .\nMeanwhile , prisons cost the US a tremendous amount . There \u2019 s the actual financial cost of putting people in prison , which the Prison Policy Initiative estimated at $ 182 billion in 2017 . There \u2019 s also the social cost of people being ripped away from their families and communities ; as one example , the New York Times calculated in 2015 that for every 100 black women not in jail or prison , there are only 83 black men \u2014 what amounts to 1.5 million \u201c missing \u201d men , who can \u2019 t be there for their kids , family , or community while incarcerated .\nIn the US , for a 20-year cap to really have an impact , the policy would have to be adopted by the states . Some 87 percent of prisoners in the US are held in state facilities . The change could also be enacted at the federal level , of course , and the feds could try to encourage states to implement such a change with financial incentives ( although similar efforts in the past haven \u2019 t been very successful ) .\nBut the majority of those in state prisons are people convicted of violent offenses : In 2015 , 54.5 percent of people in state prisons were in for violent crimes . About 15.2 percent were in for drugs .\nUntil now , much of the criminal justice reform movement has focused on reducing prison sentences for low-level , nonviolent offenders . A 20-year sentencing cap , however , would almost entirely benefit higher-level , violent offenders \u2014 which would be a good thing .\nThese violent offenders are not all , or even close to mostly , serial killers . They can be people who committed armed robberies but didn \u2019 t seriously hurt anyone . They can be accomplices of such crimes who never directly hurt anyone at all , such as the getaway driver in a robbery . They can be women who killed their abusers . They can be people who got into fights with friends or family under the influence of alcohol and other drugs but otherwise may not be likely to commit any violent crimes at all .\nAnd violent offenders , overall , make up the majority of the state prison population .\nThis is why criminal justice activists and scholars , including Pfaff in Locked In , argue that America will have to at some point confront how it treats violent offenders if it really wants to undo mass incarceration .\nAs it stands , America \u2019 s incarceration rate is 655 per 100,000 , which is higher than that of authoritarian nations like Cuba ( 510 ) , Russia ( 389 ) , and China ( 118 ) . Democratic , developed nations tend to have even lower incarceration rates than the US ; Canada \u2019 s is 114 , Germany \u2019 s is 76 , and Japan \u2019 s is 41 .\nWhen it comes to life imprisonment in particular , Mauer and Nellis \u2019 s book pointed to research that suggested the US accounts for 40 percent of the world \u2019 s total life sentences .\nBecause the US has higher lethal crime rates ( largely due to easy access to guns ) than other developed nations , there \u2019 s a good chance that the US will never have incarceration rates as low as other wealthy nations . Still , if the US wants to get back to its own historical trends \u2014 like in 1980 , when the number of people in prison was around a fifth of what it is now \u2014 it has a lot of room for improvement . But to get that low , at least some violent offenders will have to be let out of prison sooner rather than later .\nA cap will force us to think of prison as a place for rehabilitation\nA big mental shift we need to make when thinking about prisons is to see them as something more than just for punishment or a public safety mechanism . We need to start entertaining the notion that prison can \u2014 should \u2014 be a place where we can rehabilitate the incarcerated .\nEven today in US prisons , the majority of inmates will be released at some point . This is a fact we do a terrible job recognizing . The US notoriously underfunds rehabilitation and reentry services , contributing to rearrest rates of more than two-thirds within three years of release and more than three-quarters within five years . ( Not all those arrests lead to reincarceration , since they can be for minor infractions . )\nBut if the US capped all prison sentences at 20 years , it would be forced to recognize a new reality : Just about everyone put in prison will , at one point , be free . And those people will very often need programs to ensure that they can transition back to a normal life .\nThis has long been the reality for Norway , even before it capped most prison sentences at 21 years ( with a higher cap for terrorism and genocide ) . \u201c There \u2019 s no tradition in Norway for keeping people in prison for life , \u201d Ragnar Kristoffersen , a researcher at the University College of Norwegian Correctional Service who previously worked for the Ministry of Justice , told me .\nAs a result , Norway has built a prison system that looks very kind by US prison standards . ( If you want to dive deep into this , I recommend reading Jessica Benko \u2019 s piece in the New York Times Magazine . ) Cells are relatively comfortable . Rehabilitation programs are widely available ; in fact , inmates are required to have at least one activity in the daytime , whether a job , education , or , say , a sex offender program . Guards are trained , with at least a two-year college requirement , to treat inmates with respect and facilitate their rehabilitation .\nNorway also has better support once people get out of prison , with a stronger social safety net than the US \u2014 one that includes guarantees for health care and education . \u201c People have something to go to , \u201d Kristoffersen argued .\nFor Norway , this gets to a deeper cultural resistance to using prisons purely for punishment . \u201c What \u2019 s the reason ? Why do you sentence people ? Why do you punish people ? If it \u2019 s for revenge , then when is revenge enough ? \u201d Berit Johnsen , another researcher at the University College of Norwegian Correctional Service , told me .\nThat \u2019 s not to say that Norway \u2019 s prisons are a great place to be . Kristoffersen and Johnsen emphasized that , despite many media reports suggesting otherwise , being in Norway \u2019 s prisons is still unpleasant . Inmates still lose almost all their freedoms . They \u2019 re still taken from their friends , family , and communities . As Johnsen put it , \u201c It is prison . You don \u2019 t want to go there . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s not clear how much more effective Norway \u2019 s system is compared to the US \u2019 s . As Benko noted in the New York Times , the US reincarceration rate \u2014 which measures how likely released inmates are to be locked up again \u2014 over two years is about 29 percent . That \u2019 s only a bit higher than Norway \u2019 s rate of 25 percent . But Norway is still doing better , and its violent crime and homicide rates are much better too \u2014 suggesting that the cap , at the very least , doesn \u2019 t cause more crime even as it limits the harms of incarceration .\nThis is far from the only solution to mass incarceration , but it \u2019 s a good model to aim for\nIf America were to implement a 20-year cap on prison sentences , it would not end mass incarceration . If applied retroactively , it would likely lead to an earlier release for maybe a few hundred thousand inmates , at most , out of the 2.1 million people in jail or prison today .\nThe cap wouldn \u2019 t address the sentences for the majority of those 2.1 million people , who are in jail or prison for fewer than 20 years for anything from shoplifting to violent crimes .\nA cap also , crucially , wouldn \u2019 t address jail and prison admissions . While America \u2019 s incarceration rate has increased over the years in part because people are spending more time in prison , it \u2019 s also the case that more people are being admitted to jail and prison in general . To tackle that problem , other changes would be needed , such as eliminating some crimes entirely so they don \u2019 t result in prison time ( by , say , decriminalizing drug possession ) or raising the bar for what kind of crime qualifies for prison time ( like increasing the dollar amount for how much people must steal before they are sent to prison ) .\nSetting a cap also wouldn \u2019 t address other problems in the justice system , from the death penalty to the stigmatization that follows a criminal record to poor conditions in prisons generally . The death penalty in particular may pose serious problems for the cap , since a cap may perversely incentivize courts and juries to send more people to death row if life imprisonment is no longer an option . So the death penalty would need to be repealed if a cap were instituted .\nEven with an exception in place to extend prison sentences beyond the 20-year cap , there is a chance , however small , that sometimes courts will misjudge , and a person will be released when he shouldn \u2019 t have been . But this is also an issue for the current parole system , yet we accept the risk because we think it makes the system more proportional and just . If mass incarceration is a plight we want to get rid of , and that requires releasing some prisoners , we just have to take some of these risks . No solution is flawless .\nSo I think the cap is a good model to aim for \u2014 a daring idea that can really reset how we , as a society , think about prison . It leads to more systemic questions : If a prison sentence for murder is now a maximum of 20 years , can we really justify sending someone to prison for burglary or drugs for 10 or even five years ? If someone is going to be released from prison eventually , shouldn \u2019 t we ensure that person has support both in and out of prison so he can transition back to society safely ? If prison isn \u2019 t the end-all , be-all for stopping crime , should we not take other approaches more seriously ?\nI don \u2019 t write any of this lightly . I know there are some uncomfortable questions involved : Do we really want a just-released murderer living next door and working in the same office with us ? Why should we give any sort of break to someone who commits horrific acts ? Does a person who robbed someone else of any chances really deserve a second chance ? All of this is going to be especially hard to confront for victims of crime , who have seen the harms inflicted by the kind of person who would benefit from this policy firsthand .\nThese are moral , abstract questions that I can \u2019 t provide a definitive answer to . But based on the evidence and statistics , these are hurdles that we , as a society , have to think about and overcome if we want to rid ourselves of mass incarceration . The reform advocates I spoke to said that a 20-year cap is a promising way to do that \u2014 although some of them were very emphatic that some sort of exception allowing longer sentences is necessary . ( Along these lines , some reformers favor a \u201c second look \u201d provision that , instead of imposing a cap on sentences , merely requires a sentence reevaluation every 15 or 20 years . )\nNow , is any of this politically feasible ? Today , probably not . A \u2588\u2588\u2588/Morning Consult survey from 2016 , for one , found very little support for reducing punishments for violent offenders , even if they have a low chance of reoffending .\nBut in an era when views toward the criminal justice system are shifting , and discussions about everything from adopting a single-payer health care system to free college are growing , a 20-year cap on prison sentences seems like something more progressives could and should embrace .\nIf nothing else , the evidence strongly indicates that locking people up for longer isn \u2019 t doing much , if anything , to keep America safer . It \u2019 s time to try something new .",

Empirical research has consistently found that locking up people for very long periods of time does little to nothing to combat crime, and may actually lead to more crime as people spend more time in prison \u2014 missing big life opportunities for legitimate careers, and being incarcerated with others who have ties to the criminal world.\n\nThere\u2019s also good reason to believe that 20 years is a good cutoff for a maximum.

But at least tens of thousands of people in prison would benefit now \u2014 if the change were applied retroactively \u2014 and untold numbers more would benefit in the future if it were adopted by states and the federal government.\n\nI\u2019m not naive; I know there\u2019s a very, very low chance that this policy will actually be enacted.

Only by doing that can we start to really unravel a criminal justice system that\u2019s turned into one of the world\u2019s most punitive.\n\nHow a 20-year sentence cap could work\n\nCapping prison sentences at 20 years \u2014 an idea that I first heard from Sentencing Project executive director Marc Mauer \u2014 is a really consequential policy change that could affect the lives of up to hundreds of thousands of people.\n\nAmerica\u2019s prison population has exploded, from 330,000 in 1980 to 1.5 million in 2016 (though the figures have started to turn since 2009). That includes at least tens of thousands of people who are likely to spend decades in prison.\n\nIn The Meaning of Life: The Case for Abolishing Life Sentences, Mauer and Ashley Nellis wrote that the number of people sentenced to prison for life grew from 34,000 in 1984 to nearly 162,000 in 2016. The US is a huge outlier, Mauer and Nellis explained: \u201cA comprehensive 2016 international analysis of life imprisonment found that the number of people serving life imprisonment in the United States is higher than the combined total in the other 113 countries surveyed.\u201d\n\nThe idea for a cap is straightforward: No one could be sentenced for any number of charges \u2014 not attempted robbery, rape, or murder \u2014 for more than 20 years. There should be a limited exception, like there is in Norway, that lets courts extend prison sentences indefinitely for an additional five years at a time, but only if there\u2019s proof that a person still poses a public safety threat.\n\nFor a lot of people, this is going to sound ridiculous. Twenty years for murder or rape? That doesn\u2019t seem proportional to the crime.\n\nBut this gets us to a deeper conversation about the criminal justice system\u2019s purpose. Is it for punishment? Is it for public safety? Is it for rehabilitation? Is it for all of the above, or something else entirely?\n\nMy guess is for those who believe prison should punish offenders, a cap is going to be really hard to swallow. The great, great majority of people who would benefit from this change are violent criminals who have absolutely done bad things. There\u2019s no denying that. Americans may want those people to suffer.\n\nBut I think those views need to be reconsidered. Even without a cap, the majority of people in prison will be released and reenter society at some point. When we have those people literally captive, why not take the opportunity to try to make sure they can be productive members of society when they return? Why waste the potential of any human life if we have a chance, small or large, to turn it around?\n\nAnd 20 years in prison is still a very long time, so people sentenced at the cap would still suffer. Mauer told me he tries to get people to think about what it\u2019d be like to serve such a long sentence.\n\n\u201cThink back where you were in life 10 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened to you? What experiences have you had in 10 years? You might have gotten married or divorced. You might have had children. You might have had different jobs. You might have had health problems. Think through all the things that go through your life, and that\u2019s a small window into what incarceration does.\u201d\n\nTo me, that seems like a terrible punishment \u2014 even if I think it\u2019s deserved.\n\nWhy this can work without hurting public safety: people age out of crime\n\nWhat about the public safety case against capping prison sentences? Won\u2019t a released murderer, rapist, or robber just go on to victimize more people?\n\nThis concern, while genuine, misunderstands people\u2019s propensity to commit crime throughout their lives. Most murderers aren\u2019t serial killers, and they aren\u2019t very likely, especially decades later, to kill again. The same goes for other crimes.\n\nThe evidence is what\u2019s known as the age-crime curve. It shows that people tend to age out of crime. In their mid- to late teens and early 20s, people are much, much likelier to commit a crime than they are in their 30s and especially 40s and on.\n\nHere\u2019s the age-crime curve for robbery in 2014, taken from Mauer and Nellis\u2019s book:\n\nAs the chart makes clear, a person\u2019s propensity to commit a crime \u2014 in this case, a robbery \u2014 is at its highest around 20 years old. But it drops quickly after that. In his 30s, a person\u2019s chances of committing a robbery drop to 25 percent of what they were at 20. In his 40s, the chances drop to less than 12.5 percent. In his 60s, the risk nearly vanishes.\n\nThere are exceptions, like lifelong serial killers. But they\u2019re few and far between, and could be handled with limited exceptions to a 20-year cap.\n\nVirtually no one in criminology disputes the age-crime curve. Nancy La Vigne, vice president of justice policy at the Urban Institute, told me that it\u2019s \u201cpretty well established in the literature.\u201d\n\nThis shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to most people, particularly those already in their 30s, 40s, or above. Think about how likely you were as a teen to break the law, with underage drinking, using illegal drugs, shoplifting, getting into fights, and so on. Now think about how likely you are to do that today, assuming you\u2019re older. Regardless of whether you got caught in your teen years, you are likely an embodiment of the age-crime curve.\n\nJohn Pfaff, a criminal justice expert at Fordham University and the author of Locked In: The True Causes of Mass Incarceration and How to Achieve Real Reform, told me there are a few reasons for the age-crime curve.\n\n\u201cSome of it is physical and hormonal: Testosterone levels go up, testosterone levels go down; violence goes up, violence goes down. Some of it is purely physical: Even if I was as aggressive now as I was 20 years ago, I\u2019m 44 \u2014 things are slow, things ache a bit more,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut some of it is also social: Getting married is a pathway out of crime; finding a career is a pathway out of crime. So the longer we keep people in prison, the longer we tend to undermine the ways these people mature and age out of crime as they get older.\u201d\n\nOther evidence backs this up. In 2017, David Roodman of the Open Philanthropy Project conducted an extensive review of the research on longer prison sentences. He concluded that \u201ctougher sentences hardly deter crime, and that while imprisoning people temporarily stops them from committing crime outside prison walls, it also tends to increase their criminality after release. As a result, \u2018tough-on-crime\u2019 initiatives can reduce crime in the short run but cause offsetting harm in the long run.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also evidence that America\u2019s mass incarceration experiment has not done much to make the US safer. A 2015 research review by the Brennan Center for Justice estimated that more incarceration \u2014 and its abilities to incapacitate or deter criminals \u2014 explained about zero to 7 percent of the crime drop since the 1990s, although other researchers estimate it drove 10 to 25 percent of the crime drop since the \u201990s.\n\nMeanwhile, prisons cost the US a tremendous amount. There\u2019s the actual financial cost of putting people in prison, which the Prison Policy Initiative estimated at $182 billion in 2017. There\u2019s also the social cost of people being ripped away from their families and communities; as one example, the New York Times calculated in 2015 that for every 100 black women not in jail or prison, there are only 83 black men \u2014 what amounts to 1.5 million \u201cmissing\u201d men, who can\u2019t be there for their kids, family, or community while incarcerated.\n\nThis would lower sentences for violent offenses. That\u2019s good.\n\nIn the US, for a 20-year cap to really have an impact, the policy would have to be adopted by the states. Some 87 percent of prisoners in the US are held in state facilities. The change could also be enacted at the federal level, of course, and the feds could try to encourage states to implement such a change with financial incentives (although similar efforts in the past haven\u2019t been very successful).\n\nBut the majority of those in state prisons are people convicted of violent offenses: In 2015, 54.5 percent of people in state prisons were in for violent crimes. About 15.2 percent were in for drugs.\n\nUntil now, much of the criminal justice reform movement has focused on reducing prison sentences for low-level, nonviolent offenders. A 20-year sentencing cap, however, would almost entirely benefit higher-level, violent offenders \u2014 which would be a good thing.\n\nThese violent offenders are not all, or even close to mostly, serial killers. They can be people who committed armed robberies but didn\u2019t seriously hurt anyone. They can be accomplices of such crimes who never directly hurt anyone at all, such as the getaway driver in a robbery. They can be women who killed their abusers. They can be people who got into fights with friends or family under the influence of alcohol and other drugs but otherwise may not be likely to commit any violent crimes at all.\n\nAnd violent offenders, overall, make up the majority of the state prison population.\n\nThis is why criminal justice activists and scholars, including Pfaff in Locked In, argue that America will have to at some point confront how it treats violent offenders if it really wants to undo mass incarceration.\n\nAs it stands, America\u2019s incarceration rate is 655 per 100,000, which is higher than that of authoritarian nations like Cuba (510), Russia (389), and China (118). Democratic, developed nations tend to have even lower incarceration rates than the US; Canada\u2019s is 114, Germany\u2019s is 76, and Japan\u2019s is 41.\n\nWhen it comes to life imprisonment in particular, Mauer and Nellis\u2019s book pointed to research that suggested the US accounts for 40 percent of the world\u2019s total life sentences.\n\nBecause the US has higher lethal crime rates (largely due to easy access to guns) than other developed nations, there\u2019s a good chance that the US will never have incarceration rates as low as other wealthy nations. Still, if the US wants to get back to its own historical trends \u2014 like in 1980, when the number of people in prison was around a fifth of what it is now \u2014 it has a lot of room for improvement. But to get that low, at least some violent offenders will have to be let out of prison sooner rather than later.\n\nA cap will force us to think of prison as a place for rehabilitation\n\nA big mental shift we need to make when thinking about prisons is to see them as something more than just for punishment or a public safety mechanism. We need to start entertaining the notion that prison can \u2014 should \u2014 be a place where we can rehabilitate the incarcerated.\n\nEven today in US prisons, the majority of inmates will be released at some point. This is a fact we do a terrible job recognizing. The US notoriously underfunds rehabilitation and reentry services, contributing to rearrest rates of more than two-thirds within three years of release and more than three-quarters within five years. (Not all those arrests lead to reincarceration, since they can be for minor infractions.)\n\nBut if the US capped all prison sentences at 20 years, it would be forced to recognize a new reality: Just about everyone put in prison will, at one point, be free. And those people will very often need programs to ensure that they can transition back to a normal life.\n\nThis has long been the reality for Norway, even before it capped most prison sentences at 21 years (with a higher cap for terrorism and genocide). \u201cThere\u2019s no tradition in Norway for keeping people in prison for life,\u201d Ragnar Kristoffersen, a researcher at the University College of Norwegian Correctional Service who previously worked for the Ministry of Justice, told me.\n\nAs a result, Norway has built a prison system that looks very kind by US prison standards. (If you want to dive deep into this, I recommend reading Jessica Benko\u2019s piece in the New York Times Magazine.) Cells are relatively comfortable. Rehabilitation programs are widely available; in fact, inmates are required to have at least one activity in the daytime, whether a job, education, or, say, a sex offender program. Guards are trained, with at least a two-year college requirement, to treat inmates with respect and facilitate their rehabilitation.\n\nNorway also has better support once people get out of prison, with a stronger social safety net than the US \u2014 one that includes guarantees for health care and education. \u201cPeople have something to go to,\u201d Kristoffersen argued.\n\nFor Norway, this gets to a deeper cultural resistance to using prisons purely for punishment. \u201cWhat\u2019s the reason? Why do you sentence people? Why do you punish people? If it\u2019s for revenge, then when is revenge enough?\u201d Berit Johnsen, another researcher at the University College of Norwegian Correctional Service, told me.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that Norway\u2019s prisons are a great place to be. Kristoffersen and Johnsen emphasized that, despite many media reports suggesting otherwise, being in Norway\u2019s prisons is still unpleasant. Inmates still lose almost all their freedoms. They\u2019re still taken from their friends, family, and communities. As Johnsen put it, \u201cIt is prison. You don\u2019t want to go there.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how much more effective Norway\u2019s system is compared to the US\u2019s. As Benko noted in the New York Times, the US reincarceration rate \u2014 which measures how likely released inmates are to be locked up again \u2014 over two years is about 29 percent. That\u2019s only a bit higher than Norway\u2019s rate of 25 percent. But Norway is still doing better, and its violent crime and homicide rates are much better too \u2014 suggesting that the cap, at the very least, doesn\u2019t cause more crime even as it limits the harms of incarceration.\n\nThis is far from the only solution to mass incarceration, but it\u2019s a good model to aim for\n\nIf America were to implement a 20-year cap on prison sentences, it would not end mass incarceration. If applied retroactively, it would likely lead to an earlier release for maybe a few hundred thousand inmates, at most, out of the 2.1 million people in jail or prison today.\n\nThe cap wouldn\u2019t address the sentences for the majority of those 2.1 million people, who are in jail or prison for fewer than 20 years for anything from shoplifting to violent crimes.\n\nA cap also, crucially, wouldn\u2019t address jail and prison admissions. While America\u2019s incarceration rate has increased over the years in part because people are spending more time in prison, it\u2019s also the case that more people are being admitted to jail and prison in general. To tackle that problem, other changes would be needed, such as eliminating some crimes entirely so they don\u2019t result in prison time (by, say, decriminalizing drug possession) or raising the bar for what kind of crime qualifies for prison time (like increasing the dollar amount for how much people must steal before they are sent to prison).\n\nSetting a cap also wouldn\u2019t address other problems in the justice system, from the death penalty to the stigmatization that follows a criminal record to poor conditions in prisons generally. The death penalty in particular may pose serious problems for the cap, since a cap may perversely incentivize courts and juries to send more people to death row if life imprisonment is no longer an option. So the death penalty would need to be repealed if a cap were instituted.\n\nEven with an exception in place to extend prison sentences beyond the 20-year cap, there is a chance, however small, that sometimes courts will misjudge, and a person will be released when he shouldn\u2019t have been. But this is also an issue for the current parole system, yet we accept the risk because we think it makes the system more proportional and just. If mass incarceration is a plight we want to get rid of, and that requires releasing some prisoners, we just have to take some of these risks. No solution is flawless.\n\nSo I think the cap is a good model to aim for \u2014 a daring idea that can really reset how we, as a society, think about prison. It leads to more systemic questions: If a prison sentence for murder is now a maximum of 20 years, can we really justify sending someone to prison for burglary or drugs for 10 or even five years? If someone is going to be released from prison eventually, shouldn\u2019t we ensure that person has support both in and out of prison so he can transition back to society safely? If prison isn\u2019t the end-all, be-all for stopping crime, should we not take other approaches more seriously?\n\nI don\u2019t write any of this lightly. I know there are some uncomfortable questions involved: Do we really want a just-released murderer living next door and working in the same office with us? Why should we give any sort of break to someone who commits horrific acts? Does a person who robbed someone else of any chances really deserve a second chance? All of this is going to be especially hard to confront for victims of crime, who have seen the harms inflicted by the kind of person who would benefit from this policy firsthand.\n\nThese are moral, abstract questions that I can\u2019t provide a definitive answer to. But based on the evidence and statistics, these are hurdles that we, as a society, have to think about and overcome if we want to rid ourselves of mass incarceration. The reform advocates I spoke to said that a 20-year cap is a promising way to do that \u2014 although some of them were very emphatic that some sort of exception allowing longer sentences is necessary. (Along these lines, some reformers favor a \u201csecond look\u201d provision that, instead of imposing a cap on sentences, merely requires a sentence reevaluation every 15 or 20 years.)\n\nNow, is any of this politically feasible? Today, probably not. A Vox/Morning Consult survey from 2016, for one, found very little support for reducing punishments for violent offenders, even if they have a low chance of reoffending.\n\nBut in an era when views toward the criminal justice system are shifting, and discussions about everything from adopting a single-payer health care system to free college are growing, a 20-year cap on prison sentences seems like something more progressives could and should embrace.\n\nIf nothing else, the evidence strongly indicates that locking people up for longer isn\u2019t doing much, if anything, to keep America safer. It\u2019s time to try something new.\n\nWatch: How Norway designed a more humane prison\n\nSign up for the Future Perfect newsletter.
