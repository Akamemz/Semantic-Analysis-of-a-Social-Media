It \u2019 s often hard to spot in its early stages , but once it \u2019 s detected , it can reach a point of no return if it isn \u2019 t treated .\nThat \u2019 s where ObamaCare is today . It has cancer . And if it is not treated quickly and aggressively , it will die .\nThe cancer started to grow soon after the Affordable Care Act went into effect , but the spread was too slow to display visible damage . But now it \u2019 s detectable , and it has started to invade much of the U.S. economy and our health care systems . Here are some of the symptoms :\nDeclining enrollment numbers . ObamaCare was designed to provide quality health insurance to people who couldn \u2019 t afford it \u2013 and for a few years we saw a significant number of early adopters . But a disproportionate number of them were people who previously couldn \u2019 t buy health insurance because it was too expensive or because the insurance companies wouldn \u2019 t cover their pre-existing conditions . After the ACA was passed , they jumped at the chance to get insurance \u2013 and there was a benefit for them .\nThe projections of ObamaCare \u2019 s success were overestimated . The projections of its cost were underestimated . And we still haven \u2019 t found a way to provide health care for everyone at a price that is sustainable and ensures quality care for the long haul .\nBut look at what \u2019 s happening now : The projected number of enrollees for 2016 \u2013 20 million on the federal and state health exchanges \u2013 has been cut in half to 10 million , according to Health and Human Resources Secretary Sylvia Burwell . Most of the shortfall is attributed to young , healthier individuals who have decided not to sign up . But their contribution to the system is critical , because it helps cover the losses of the older , less healthy people who participate .\nIf the government \u2019 s marketing efforts are successful and those who are already enrolled don \u2019 t drop out , the government predicts that 3 to 4 million people will join the system next year . But the economics that were the basis of financing ObamaCare have already been sliced in half , and there is no plan to compensate for the shortfall that will result .\nRising premiums . In the past few weeks , many state insurance regulators have approved all or most of the premium increases sought by the largest health plans in their states . When ObamaCare went into effect , many of these plans offered low rates , anticipating that they would bring in new customers .\nInstead , they dug themselves a very deep hole . The customers they took on were less healthy than they expected , and they cost them much more than they \u2019 d anticipated . They priced themselves at an unsustainable rate , and now they can \u2019 t dig out because the projected number of new members has been cut in half .\nYou don \u2019 t need a math degree to know what a company facing this kind of loss will do to stay afloat : It will raise its prices .
