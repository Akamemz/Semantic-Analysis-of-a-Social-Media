It once belonged to an Israeli police officer , but now it belongs to Jeff , John \u2019 s brother , an early birthday present to himself . Together they own this strip club , the Blue Parrot Cabaret , dark and sparse with a front door the color of cherry skin .

He is the type of man who could have worked at a video store or sold comic books or telescopes , a man proud to be a connoisseur . And now here he is , in a building that Jeff needed to mortgage his farm six years ago to help him open , on the fringes of a college town , the both of them sitting at a back table in a palace of human fantasies , talking about guns while half-naked women lead men upstairs by the hand to squishy leather love seats .\nJohn passes the Browning to me .
