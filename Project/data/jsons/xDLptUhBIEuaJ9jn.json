Today , amid a national crisis , the script has flipped . In key ways President Trump has deferred to governors , and hesitated to use the powers at his disposal \u2013 both formal and informal .\nThe moment is laden with irony . Since taking office , Mr. Trump \u2019 s critics have called him a wannabe autocrat as he blew through norms and pushed the boundaries of the Constitution \u2019 s checks and balances .\nNow , at a time when a president might be expected to use executive authority to the max , these same critics want him to be more autocratic . Call for a national lockdown , some say . Order the production and acquisition of medical supplies , New York Gov .

Mr. Trump \u2019 s declaration of a \u201c national emergency , \u201d announced March 13 , frees up federal resources to address the crisis , not command action from the populace .
