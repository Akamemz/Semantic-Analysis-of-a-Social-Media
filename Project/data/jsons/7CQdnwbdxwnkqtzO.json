Globally , the company \u2019 s carpet-making uses one-third the water it used to . The company \u2019 s worldwide contribution to landfills has been cut by 80 percent .\n\u201c He bet his entire company , \u201d said Bob Fox , an architect who specializes in \u201c green \u201d buildings and who , like Mr. Anderson , is a member of the advisory board of the Harvard Center for Health and the Global Environment . \u201c It worked out probably better even than he hoped . He has set the mark for every other corporation in this country . \u201d\nAnd in the process , Mr. Anderson has turned into perhaps the leading corporate evangelist for sustainability . He had a head start , he acknowledges , because he ran his company and controlled its voting stock . But he can make the case effectively , he said , because his Interface experience teaches that sustainability \u201c doesn \u2019 t cost , it pays \u201d \u2014 in customer loyalty , employee spirit and hard cash . He says Interface sustainability efforts have saved the company more than $ 336 million since 1995 .\nIn fact , sustainability has been such a successful strategy that Interface established a consulting arm last year , to market its methods to other companies .\nAs befits an evangelist , Mr. Anderson , a trim 72-year-old , has taken his message on the road , preaching the sermon of sustainability in at least 115 speeches around the world last year alone .\nSince last year , when he turned operating responsibilities over to Dan Hendrix , his successor as chief executive , selling sustainability has been \u201c pretty much my full-time job , \u201d Mr. Anderson said , and several people on the company payroll work more or less full time on it too , handling his schedule and fielding inquiries . \u201c I think he was a typical corporate executive : the bottom line was everything , \u201d said Eric Chivian , director of the Harvard Center . \u201c He really did not think about the impact of his work . \u201d\nBut today , Dr. Chivian said , Mr. Anderson is \u201c a model of creative thinking about sustainable business practices . \u201d\nWhen Mr. Anderson began his crusade , there were those who thought it was quixotic , and some in the company worried that he was a bit too intense about it . Others thought carpet tiles \u2014 squares of nylon pile glued ubiquitously underfoot in offices , classrooms , hospitals , airports and elsewhere \u2014 were an unlikely focus for an effort to change the way business does business .\n\u201c Well , he won us all over , \u201d said Jo Ann Bachman , one of Mr. Anderson \u2019 s assistants .\nFor one thing , he is a carpet tile enthusiast . After a short stint at Procter & Gamble , Mr. Anderson , a Georgia native and 1956 graduate of Georgia Tech , was working in the carpet division of Callaway Mills when he discovered carpet tiles on a trip to England that he also describes in his book \u201c Mid-Course Correction \u201d ( Chelsea Green , 1998 ) .\nIt was the early 1970s , he said , and \u201c the office of the future was just then emerging , \u201d with more and more electronic equipment fed by more and more wires running under the floors , as walls gave way to cubicles . Carpet tile allowed businesses to move equipment at will , and the tiles could be replaced individually as they wore out . \u201c It just made so much sense , \u201d he said .\nSo he put together the necessary financing and started Interface in 1973 . Today , the company says it has about $ 1.1 billion in annual sales and 38 percent of the global market for carpet tiles .\nBut when it comes to the environment , he eventually realized , carpet \u201c is a pretty abusive industry . \u201d\nCarpet makers use lots of petroleum and petroleum derivatives , both as components of synthetic carpet and to power its production . Dyeing carpet is water- and energy-intensive . And when people are finished with the carpet , \u201c it goes into landfills where it lasts probably 20,000 years , \u201d Mr. Anderson said . \u201c Abusive . \u201d\nSo he challenged his employees to find ways to turn all of that around . And he forestalled objections from his own stockholders , he said , by making the elimination of waste the first target . \u201c We saved money from Day 1 , \u201d he said .\nHe acknowledges that some of the advances the company has made so far are relatively obvious and easy , and that some of its claimed progress relies on steps , like carbon credits , that are far from ideal . For example , the company pays to plant trees that , in theory , take up enough carbon to compensate for the greenhouse gas generated by airplane flights on company business .\n\u201c All you are really doing is inventorying the carbon for 200 years , \u201d Mr. Anderson said of the company \u2019 s tree-planting efforts , which it subcontracts to a company in the carbon credit business . \u201c It \u2019 s better than nothing , but it \u2019 s temporary . \u201d\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you 're not a robot by clicking the box .
