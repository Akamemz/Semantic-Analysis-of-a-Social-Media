They can ban users for totally arbitrary and inscrutable reasons . If you sue over a Twitter or Facebook ban , you will almost certainly lose . Despite this , people keep filing lawsuits claiming they \u2019 ve been censored on social media \u2014 and today , courts handed down another defeat .\nAn appeals court in Washington , DC just rejected a complaint by Laura Loomer , the conservative activist who was banned from Twitter for anti-Muslim tweets and later chained herself to the company \u2019 s headquarters in protest . Loomer argued that Facebook , Google , Twitter , and Apple had all colluded to suppress conservative content , violating Loomer \u2019 s First Amendment rights in the process . The court disagreed and threw out the suit .\nIt \u2019 s convenient timing , given that President Donald Trump has spent the past day excoriating Twitter for its alleged bias . Trump threatened Twitter after it applied a fact-checking label to his tweets , threatening some kind of unknown action to \u201c strongly regulate \u201d or close down sites that \u201c silence conservatives \u2019 voices . \u201d\nAnti-bias lawsuits \u2014 where people argue Twitter , Google , or Facebook are discriminating against them for political reasons and legally obligated to carry their speech \u2014 offer an illuminating look at why Trump \u2019 s boldest threats are probably bluster . Courts across the country have repeatedly defended social networks \u2019 rights to ban at will . If Trump wanted to shut down sites that went against his wishes , he \u2019 d need to basically upend this precedent .\nConservative blogger and activist Charles C. Johnson has been embroiled in multiple lawsuits , one of which accused Twitter of violating his free speech rights when it banned him in 2015 . In mid-2018 , a California court granted Twitter \u2019 s request to dismiss the complaint , finding that the rights at stake were Twitter \u2019 s , not Johnson \u2019 s . \u201c It is well established that the constitutional right to free speech includes the right not to speak , \u201d read its ruling . Twitter \u2019 s rules \u201c clearly state that users may not post threatening tweets , and also that [ Twitter ] may unilaterally , for any reason , terminate a user \u2019 s account . The rules reflect [ Twitter \u2019 s ] exercise of free speech . \u201d\nFringe far-right figure Jared Taylor , a white nationalist , sued Twitter for banning him in 2018 \u2014 claiming he \u2019 d been discriminated against because of his racist viewpoints . California judge Harold Kahn gave Taylor a surprising legal win when he allowed the case to proceed , calling it a \u201c classic public interest lawsuit. \u201d But Taylor \u2019 s luck didn \u2019 t last . As legal expert Eric Goldman discusses here , a California appeals court said the exact logic of Taylor \u2019 s suit didn \u2019 t matter . Twitter \u2019 s moderation choices were protected under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act .\n\u201c Revenge porn mogul \u201d Craig Brittain , who ran for an Arizona Senate seat in 2018 , was also angry at Twitter for banning him . Brittain hit Twitter with a laundry list of claims , alleging everything from First Amendment violations to infliction of emotional distress . A California court found that Brittain \u2019 s claims hinged on treating Twitter as a publisher of his content and Section 230 clearly contradicted these claims .\nOne unusual political lawsuit came from the Federal Agency of News ( FAN ) , which was allegedly tied to the Russian Internet Research Agency \u201c troll farm. \u201d Facebook removed FAN \u2019 s page along with a lot of other propaganda in 2016 . FAN then sued Facebook for First Amendment violations and breach of contract . Judge Lucy Koh slapped down the case once in 2019 and again in early 2020 , following much of the reasoning described above . Although , as Goldman \u2019 s blog details , FAN had some particularly weird misconceptions about internet law , including the idea that Section 230 had an exception for political speech . For the record , it doesn \u2019 t .\nConservative advocacy group Prager University filed one of the best-known bias suits against Google in 2017 , alleging that YouTube had unfairly restricted access to some of its videos . Like Loomer , PragerU accused Google of violating the First Amendment . Among other claims , it also said Google had violated the Lanham Act with false advertising .\nNeither of these arguments worked . California federal judge Lucy Koh dismissed the case in 2018 , saying Google and YouTube were \u201c private entities who created their own video-sharing social media website and make decisions about whether and how to regulate content that has been uploaded on that website , \u201d not federal agencies or companies that functioned as an official arm of the government .\nAn appeals court upheld the dismissal in February of this year , saying PragerU \u2019 s censorship claim \u201c faces a formidable threshold hurdle : YouTube is a private entity . The Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment prohibits the government \u2014 not a private party \u2014 from abridging speech . \u201d\nAt least one major Democratic politician has filed an anti-bias suit as well . Presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard sued Google in 2019 after the company briefly suspended her ad account , alleging the company was trying to undercut her bid for the party \u2019 s nomination .\nThis suit got a blisteringly snarky dismissal in March . California district Judge Stephen Wilson noted that \u201c Google is not now , nor ( to the Court \u2019 s knowledge ) has it ever been , an arm of the United States government. \u201d He cited the case against PragerU as legal precedent , concluding again that private web platforms aren \u2019 t held to the same standards as governments .\nIn one very recent case , Twitter user Robert Wilson claimed he was banned for \u201c freedom of speech and or heterosexual expressions \u201d and sued for civil rights and First Amendment violations . As expected , this didn \u2019 t fly . A West Virginia court ruled against this argument just a few weeks ago , saying Twitter was clearly a private forum . \u201c That private social media companies now host platforms which imitate the functions of public forums \u2014 in many respects more effectively than the traditional public forums of government-owned sidewalks , streets , and public parks \u2014 does not mean that the entities are state-actors , \u201d read the ruling .\nLaura Loomer made one of the most complicated cases against Silicon Valley . She sued alongside conservative legal group Freedom Watch in 2018 , claiming that four of the tech world \u2019 s biggest companies had violated antitrust law by conspiring to suppress conservative content on their platforms , as well as violated the First Amendment by acting as \u201c quasi-state actors . \u201d\nThe companies failed to get the suit thrown out immediately , with the DC Circuit Court of Appeals saying the claims weren \u2019 t clear enough to dismiss out of hand . But today , the actual ruling was squarely against Loomer . \u201c The Plaintiffs raise non-trivial concerns , \u201d the court concluded . But they \u201c failed to state viable legal claims \u201d to support them \u2014 including evidence that a conspiracy existed or that private websites were public spaces that operated like a government .\nPeople have been suing internet platforms for banning them since long before Trump took office ; back in 2009 , for instance , a PlayStation Network user sued on the grounds that Sony had created a \u201c company town. \u201d ( The user lost . ) Courts have overwhelmingly concluded that social media networks can ban , limit , or otherwise suppress users \u2019 posts .\nConversely , government figures like Trump actually face strict rules about blocking users . Last year , a court required Trump to unblock Twitter accounts that had criticized him , determining that his Twitter account specifically \u2014 not the site as a whole \u2014 constituted a public space protected by the First Amendment .
