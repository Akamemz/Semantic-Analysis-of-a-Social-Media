'\nDuring the worst days of the Obamacare rollout last year , Kathleen Sebelius kept her spirits up by thinking about \u2026 Medicare .\nAs the Obamacare website was crashing and conservative interest groups were shining the spotlight on canceled health plans , the embattled Health and Human Services secretary flashed back to the fierce battles over the creation of Medicare in the 1960s , when the American Medical Association fought its passage and called it \u201c socialized medicine. \u201d Now , she says , when the AMA speaks out about Medicare , it \u2019 s when the doctors are trying to prevent their Medicare payments from being cut .\nThe lesson for future political leaders who might be thinking about the next ambitious social programs ?
