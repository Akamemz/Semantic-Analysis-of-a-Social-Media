    "content": "There was one obvious loser in the first round of Democratic debates : foreign policy .\nNight one eked out a few notable moments , but the bar somehow lowered on night two , when the 10 candidates on stage barely engaged with some of the most critical foreign and national security issues the US is facing right now .\nCandidates on both nights did bring up foreign policy briefly in discussions of how to address the poverty and violence in Central America that are forcing people to flee to the US . On the second night , a few candidates said they \u2019 d seek to rebuild the US \u2019 s relationships with NATO allies after the damage done by President Donald Trump . And a few on both nights mentioned the threats posed by Russia and China \u2014 though no one offered specifics on how to deal with either of those geopolitical foes .\nAuthor Marianne Williamson \u2019 s plan to call the prime minister of New Zealand as her first act as president and tell her \u201c Girlfriend , you are so on \u201d may have been the most detailed proposal on Thursday night .\nOf course , this is not entirely the candidates \u2019 fault . Twenty hopefuls appeared on stage over two days , with limited time to talk . All were very much at the mercy of moderators who were far more focused on domestic issues like health care , immigration , and the economy than foreign affairs .\nBut when questions did come up , candidates \u2019 answers often lacked substance . For instance , on Thursday night , Sen. Michael Bennett ( D-CO ) and entrepreneur Andrew Yang were asked how they \u2019 d handle China .\nBoth replied that Russia was a greater geopolitical threat because of its meddling in the elections ( though neither offered a plan to circumvent that particular menace , either ) . And both said that they agreed China was an economic threat , but that a trade war isn \u2019 t the right approach . What the right approach is , however , was never explained .\nSouth Bend , Indiana , Mayor Pete Buttigieg was also asked how he \u2019 d stand up to China . \u201c We have to recognize that the China challenge is a serious one , \u201d he replied . \u201c This is not something to dismiss or wave away . China is using technology for the perfection of dictators . \u201d\nButtigieg then criticized Trump \u2019 s economic approach , saying that \u201c this president is fixated on the relationship that if all that mattered was the balance on dishwashers \u201d rather than countering an authoritarian China .\n\u201c The biggest thing we have to do is invest in our own domestic competitiveness , \u201d he continued . \u201c If we disinvest , we will never be able to compete . If we want to be an alternative , we actually have to demonstrate that we care about democratic values at home . \u201d\nEven there , Buttigieg didn \u2019 t really explain how he \u2019 d invest in this domestic competitiveness . And that was pretty much the end of the direct questions about China , only one of which went to a top tier contender ( Buttigieg ) . China only came up again toward the end , when candidates Yang and former Colorado Gov . John Hickenlooper both said they \u2019 d like to reset the US-China relationship as president .\nForeign policy doesn \u2019 t tend to be an issue high on voters \u2019 lists of concerns \u2014 so with limited time and a huge field , it makes sense to focus more on domestic political debates .\nBut the lack of national security and foreign policy questions is a big deal , and will be even more so in the upcoming debates . International affairs is one area where the president has significant unilateral power . And as \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Alex Ward has noted , it \u2019 s also an area where \u201c their decisions often have immediate life-or-death consequences for thousands if not millions of people . \u201d\nPresident Donald Trump has proven this during his tenure .
