    "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President Trump said Sunday he doesn \u2019 t believe congressional negotiators will strike a deal over border-wall funding that he could accept and vowed that he would build a wall anyway , using emergency powers if need be .\nMr. Trump , in an interview , assessed the chances of whether a newly formed group of 17 lawmakers could craft a deal before the next government-funding lapse , in less than three weeks : \u201c I personally think it \u2019 s less than 50-50 , but you have a lot of very good people on that board . \u201d\nHe made his comments as hundreds of thousands of federal employees prepared to head back to work Monday following the president \u2019 s move Friday to reopen the government after the 35-day partial shutdown , even without funding for his long-promised wall along the border with Mexico . The group of 17 lawmakers is now tasked with hashing out a longer-term deal on border security and , potentially , broader immigration issues .\nBoth topics are politically charged and difficult to navigate , just as they were in late December , when Mr. Trump first refused to sign any spending bills that didn \u2019 t include at least $ 5.7 billion to go toward building a border wall .\nAsked if he would accept less than $ 5.7 billion in the next round of negotiations , Mr. Trump said : \u201c I doubt it , \u201d adding , \u201c I have to do it right . \u201d\nDemocrats are firmly opposed to the concept of a physical wall , but they have been willing to fund replacement fencing , levees and bollard barriers , in addition to more immigration judges , border agents and technology .\nOn Sunday , Democratic leaders reiterated that they support border-security measures and would negotiate now that the government is open . \u201c Shutdowns are not legitimate negotiating tactics when there \u2019 s a public-policy disagreement between two branches of government , \u201d Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York , chairman of the House Democratic caucus , said on NBC .\nIn the interview Sunday , Mr. Trump also made clear he was skeptical about any deal that trades wall money for a wider immigration overhaul .\n\u201c I doubt it , \u201d he said , when asked if he would agree to citizenship for a group of immigrants illegally brought to the U.S. as children , known as Dreamers , in exchange for border-wall funding .\n\u201c That \u2019 s a separate subject to be taken up at a separate time , \u201d said Mr. Trump , a Republican . Earlier this month , the president offered three years of temporary protections for Dreamers as part of a broader proposal , but Democrats said they wanted more permanent protections , including a path to citizenship , for those immigrants .\nIn the interview , Mr. Trump said he wouldn \u2019 t rule out another shutdown , calling it \u201c certainly an option . \u201d\nAfter a shutdown that has been bruising for federal workers and that taxed the wider economy , the White House \u2019 s acting chief of staff , Mick Mulvaney , said on CBS on Sunday that workers by the end of the week should receive their first paychecks in more than a month . The White House budget office published over the weekend a checklist for government agencies to consider as they reopen , recommending , among other things , that they have adequate staffing to process payroll and employee benefits .\nBut Mr. Trump \u2019 s comments make clear that if keeping the government open hinges on the issue of immigration , the path forward will be tricky . Congress has struggled for years to tackle a broader overhaul of the immigration system , and while lawmakers were hopeful that Congress and the White House would be eager to avoid another shutdown , persuading Mr. Trump to sign it may remain a separate challenge .\nAdding to that challenge for Mr. Trump : His leverage on the immigration issue has only diminished since he took office . Republicans , who controlled Congress for much of his presidency , lost the House majority in the November elections , and polling shows voters largely blamed Mr. Trump for a shutdown that left about 800,000 federal workers without pay . Over the weekend , Mr. Trump took heat from some conservative commentators who said he had caved to Democrats for reopening the government without wall funding .\nCommentator Ann Coulter , for example , described Mr. Trump as a \u201c wimp . \u201d\n\u201c I hear she \u2019 s become very hostile , \u201d Mr. Trump said in the interview . \u201c Maybe I didn \u2019 t return her phone call or something . \u201d\nNow the focus shifts to the lawmakers tasked with coming to an agreement . Led by House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey ( D. , N.Y. ) , the group is expected to hold its first public meeting this week . Its roster is drawn from members from both chambers \u2019 appropriations committees , which draft the spending bills that fund the government , and includes some lawmakers deeply versed in immigration policy .\nSeven of the 17 total members are senators , including four Republicans and three Democrats . There are 10 House lawmakers , including six Democrats and four Republicans . Any final compromise would need bipartisan support to advance to a vote before both chambers . None of the lawmakers are bomb-throwers likely to buck their party \u2019 s leaders , who will retain control over the biggest decisions , including the final price tag and whether anything resembling a wall will be funded .\n\u201c I \u2019 m going to remain optimistic\u2026if you look at the impetus from both sides , the shutdown was a miserable experience for everybody , \u201d Sen. Shelley Moore Capito ( R. , W.Va. ) , a member of the group , said Sunday . \u201c There \u2019 s a lot that tells me we may not get there , but there \u2019 s more that \u2019 s telling me we have the urge to demonstrate we can reach a consensus or we \u2019 re signaling to the American people there \u2019 s going to be two years of this [ fighting ] all of the time . \u201d\nThe thorniest question is likely to be what kinds of physical barriers would be funded along the border . Mr. Trump has been insistent on a wall in order to deliver on his signature campaign promise , while Democrats have been equally resistant to one .\n\u201c Have I not been clear on a wall ? \u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D. , Calif. ) said Friday . \u201c I \u2019 ve been very clear on the wall . \u201d\nAsked about the form of barrier he would accept on the border with Mexico , Mr. Trump said : \u201c I have to see what it is . As long as it can stop criminals , gangs , human trafficking and drugs , I \u2019 m open to anything . But the only thing that will work is a very strong form of physical barrier . \u201d\nBut Democrats and Republicans often use different rhetoric when describing the same provisions , suggesting they may be able to agree on some kind of funding that Republicans would consider a wall but Democrats would say constitutes border security .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve talked past each other to a certain extent , particularly on the notion of barriers , \u201d Sen . Rob Portman ( R. , Ohio ) told reporters Friday . \u201c I don \u2019 t think we \u2019 re that far apart . \u201d\nIn the Senate , the appropriations committee in June 2018 approved a bill funding the Homeland Security Department , which oversees the border , that included $ 1.6 billion for border security . That bill would have funded fencing , beefed-up Border Patrol and Coast Guard staffing and new technology , but not a concrete wall . Ms. Capito said she thought that bill could serve as the group \u2019 s starting point .\nMr. Trump , whose own rhetoric about what he would consider to be a border wall has often changed , has recently said he isn \u2019 t seeking a concrete barrier along the entirety of the border . Earlier this month , the administration proposed adding 234 miles of steel slats and other physical barriers . His latest proposal included $ 5.7 billion for steel barriers , as well as additional funds for drug-detection technology , more border agents , law-enforcement officials and immigration judges .\nHouse Democrats had been preparing a proposal last week outlining more than $ 5 billion in border-security enhancements they supported , although they held back from releasing it while Senate leaders pulled together the three-week spending bill that reopened the government Friday night . Those ideas are likely to be part of the coming negotiations .\nShould Mr. Trump declare a national emergency at the border , he could divert funds for military-construction projects to fund a border wall , but such a move would certainly face legal challenges .\nMany congressional Republicans are also apprehensive it could set a precedent that future Democratic presidents could declare a national emergency over their own priorities .\n\u201c It \u2019 ll be a terrible idea . I hope he doesn \u2019 t do it , \u201d Sen. Marco Rubio ( R. , Fla. ) said Sunday on NBC of the president \u2019 s declaring a national emergency . Given the likelihood of a court challenge , \u201c you could very well wind up in sort of a theatric victory at the front end and then not getting it done . \u201d",
