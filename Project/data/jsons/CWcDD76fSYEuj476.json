We should never stop trying to secure the release of any American soldier who is being held hostage . I know all Americans feel this way .\nI completely disagree , however , with the manner in which the Obama administration achieved Bergdahl \u2019 s freedom . This is a major departure from American policy , and one that could generate disastrous consequences for our soldiers , our diplomats , and any American who travels abroad .\nWhen terrorists and criminals unequivocally know , as they did prior to this week , that the United States of America does not negotiate with them , they have far less incentive to abduct our citizens .\nBy its actions has the Obama administration inadvertently put a target on the backs of all Americans travelling abroad ? Let \u2019 s hope not .\nRefusing to negotiate with terrorists makes our people safer . Terrorists all over the world need to know that our interaction with them will be limited solely to our effort to destroy them .\nThe White House is now saying that Bergdahl \u2019 s release was nothing more than a prisoner exchange , which it contends is common in times of war . If we were to accept that notion , perhaps we should take a look at this so called \u201c prisoner exchange . \u201c But the White House certainly doesn \u2019 t want you to do that .\nWhen you look at the rap sheets of the five terrorists we released from detention at Guantanamo , it is ugly . These men were five hardened terrorists with blood on their hands , all of whom were deemed by the U.S. military to be \u201c high risk \u201d to return to the fight .\nFor instance , the military report says of Mulla Norullah Noori that \u201c he led troops against the US and Coalition forces \u201d , and that he \u201c is wanted by the UN for possible war crimes. \u201d Does anyone anywhere believe these five will now change their ways , and become peaceful men ? Of course not .\nAnd what of Mr. Bergdahl ? The picture here is murky . It appears that he became very disillusioned with the war in Afghanistan , and he is quoted as saying , prior to captivity , that he was \u201c ashamed to be an American \u201d and that \u201c the title of US soldier is just the lie of fools . \u201d\nIt has also been suggested , though not confirmed , that he may have deserted , and that other American soldiers may have lost their lives in an effort to rescue him .\nThen there is the small detail that President Obama likely broke the law \u2013 by failing to properly notify Congressional leaders -- in the way he released the five terrorists being held at Guantanamo .\nThe sad truth is that this aspect of the story is a yawner .
