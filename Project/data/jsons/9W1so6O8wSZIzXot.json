Prominent among them was a proposed fee of roughly $ 2,000 that illegal immigrants would have to pay before they could earn legal status .\nAs part of that plan , which was still being completed on Sunday , these immigrants would have to pay $ 500 when they apply for a temporary work permit , and would have the next 10 years to pay the remaining $ 1,500 or so , a person familiar with the negotiations said .\nRepublicans in particular have insisted that the 11 million illegal immigrants already in the country should face a tough path \u2014 including paying a fee , getting in line behind those seeking citizenship but who have not lived in the country illegally , and learning English \u2014 before they could apply for citizenship .\nA Senate aide described the $ 2,000 figure as \u201c significant but not impossible , punitive but not unreasonable. \u201d Democrats and immigration advocates had originally pushed for a lower amount .\nMr. Rubio \u2019 s one-man media blitz on Sunday was a striking show of confidence for a lawmaker who only weeks ago had been a voice of caution , a counterweight to the optimism being expressed by others in the group .\nOn Sunday , by discussing the plan on the five major network talk shows and on the Spanish-language networks Telemundo and Univision , he was clearly signaling that the plan was ready for scrutiny by the public and by Congress , and that he was prepared to throw his full weight behind it \u2014 perhaps , at the same time , risking his own prospects for a widely expected presidential run in 2016 .\nIn each appearance he spoke with a sense of urgency , arguing that the plan did not constitute amnesty for illegal immigrants . He said that they would receive no federal benefits during the 13 or so years it would take them to qualify for full citizenship and that the plan depended on tougher border security and better systems for verifying the employment and legal standing of people already in the country .\nThe new plan would also include a path to citizenship for an additional 500,000 or more people who are currently in \u201c limbo \u201d status \u2014 including refugees ; people who face persecution in their home countries ; and people with visas specifically designated for trading and investing with countries with which the United States has signed treaties of commerce and navigation , another person familiar with the bill said .\nMr. Rubio \u2019 s status as a Tea Party member , a prominent young Latino and a rising star in the Republican Party means his imprimatur on the legislation will carry weight .
