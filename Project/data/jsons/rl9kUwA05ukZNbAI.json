The Senate has shattered records in confirming the president \u2019 s well-qualified judicial nominees , including two outstanding jurists to serve on the Supreme Court\nAnd together , we passed the first comprehensive reform of the nation \u2019 s tax code in a generation . Already , Americans \u2019 paychecks are growing , consumer confidence is high and unemployment has reached a near 50-year low .\nAfter this prolific run , I was not surprised to be asked over the past week about just how much the American people can expect from the next Congress under divided leadership . What can we realistically accomplish ?\nI have good news : reports of the death of bipartisanship in Washington have been wildly exaggerated . In fact , some of the most significant accomplishments of this Congress have been delivered with overwhelmingly bipartisan support .\nUnder bipartisan committee leadership , we took major steps toward restoring regular order to our appropriations process .

In fact , America \u2019 s Water Infrastructure Act \u2013 designed to improve interstate commerce , water quality and flood safety \u2013 passed the Senate by a vote of 99-1 .\nAnd in August , the Senate voted unanimously to expand Americans \u2019 opportunities to receive technical and career-focused education .\nWe \u2019 ve passed 22 pieces of legislation produced by the bipartisan work of the Veterans \u2019 Affairs Committee . From improving the efficiency of Department of Veterans Affairs medical facilities to enhancing access to post-9/11 GI Bill educational benefits , each of these pieces of legislation was designed to help America keep its promises to returning heroes and their families .\nAnd last month , the Senate passed a landmark package of targeted resources to combat the opioid epidemic .
