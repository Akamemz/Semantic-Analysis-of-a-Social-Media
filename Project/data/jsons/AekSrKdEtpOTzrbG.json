The campaign came out and cleared that up : what he was talking about was a Washington Post article . \u201d\nIndeed , when asked to explain Trump \u2019 s claim of illegal voting , his transition team pointed journalists to a 2014 article in the Washington Post by two academics \u2013 which the Post \u2019 s website has since prefaced with a disclaimer \u2013 along with a 2012 Pew Research study . Neither proved that non-citizens voted in 2016 .\nMedia analysts still believe , however , that Phillips \u2019 s \u201c Twitter-born conspiracy theory \u201d , as the Washington Post put it , is the most likely explanation for Trump \u2019 s unsubstantiated outburst on 27 November .\nThe episode offers a study in the power of lone activists to make claims that soon become reported with the confidence of facts on myriad websites . It also illustrates the blowback they can endure when , rightly or wrongly , Trump is perceived as having recycled those claims to serve his dangerously selective worldview .\nPhillips , a 56-year-old grandfather based in Austin , Texas , said : \u201c I \u2019 m on the edge and you can probably hear it in my voice . In the last couple of days I \u2019 ve been called a child molester . Somebody posted something up there that I \u2019 ve been arrested for armed robbery ; it turned out that if you drilled into that it was some black guy that was 15 years younger than me .
