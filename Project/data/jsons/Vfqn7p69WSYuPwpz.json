Ron Johnson of the Highway Patrol , who is overseeing security . The scene stood in stark contrast to clashes earlier this week when officers wore riot gear .\nThe latest protests had a light , almost jubilant atmosphere among the racially mixed crowd , more akin to a parade or block party . The streets were filled with music , free food and even laughter . When darkness fell -- the point at which previous protests have grown tense -- no uniformed officers were in sight outside the burned-out QuikTrip convenience store that had become a flashpoint for standoffs between police and protesters .\n`` You can feel it . You can see it , '' protester Cleo Willis said of the change . `` Now it 's up to us to ride that feeling .
