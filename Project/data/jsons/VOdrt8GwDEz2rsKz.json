Churches and other tax-exempt organizations are restricted from endorsing or explicitly opposing political candidates under the 1954 Johnson Amendment , but the executive order Trump signed Thursday makes clear that those activities would still not be permitted .\nInstead , the order prevents the IRS from expanding its restrictions on political activity by religious groups . It also provides `` regulatory relief '' for organizations that object on religious grounds to a provision in Obamacare that mandates employers provide certain health services , including coverage for contraception .\nEvangelical Christian leader Russell Moore said the order is `` more symbolic than substantive . ''\n`` The very fact that religious freedom is part of the conversation and religious freedom is being affirmed I think is a step in the right direction , '' he said on CNN 's `` Erin Burnett OutFront '' Thursday night . `` Now obviously if this is the end of the story , I 'm really disappointed , but I think we ought to hold out the hope that this is just the beginning and that there are more steps to be made .

''\n`` If the effort succeeds these churches would become conduits for unregulated 'dark money ' in elections , with no restrictions or disclosure requirements , '' he said .\nIn a letter delivered to House and Senate leaders last month , a group of religious leaders argued against scrapping the Johnson amendment , citing similar concerns that such a move could turn religious groups into political organizations .\n`` The charitable sector , particularly houses of worship , should not become another cog in a political machine or another loophole in campaign finance laws , '' the group wrote .\nBriefing reporters Wednesday evening , a senior Trump administration official downplayed the possibility that churches would soon act as political groups advocating for particular candidates .\n`` Nobody is suggesting that churches are allowed , or it 's legal , for tax-exempt organizations to tax out ads endorsing candidates , '' the official said . `` That 's illegal now for them , as a condition of their tax-exempt status . So we 're not changing what 's legal , we 're not changing what 's illegal , just enforcement discretion . ''\nSelectively enforcing law has drawn scrutiny in past administrations , and before the order was signed Wednesday , some experts predicted it could present another legal challenge to Trump 's administration .\nThe American Civil Liberties Union threatened the Trump administration with a lawsuit when details of the executive order emerged Wednesday .\nBut on Thursday , the group rescinded its threat , saying the order had no teeth .\n`` It turned out the order signing was an elaborate photo-op with no discernible policy outcome , '' the organization tweeted . `` Trump 's assertion that he wished to 'totally destroy ' the Johnson amendment with this order has proven to be a textbook case of 'fake news .
