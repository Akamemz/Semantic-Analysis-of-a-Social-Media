On Saturday, Senate Democrats tried to pass a clean debt limit hike through December 31, 2014. That vote failed 53 to 45. Democrats will vote for any debt limit increase as long as it has no other policy attached. Ideally, Democrats would like abolish the debt limit entirely.\n\n2) A short-term government funding deal, at sequester spending levels, the shorter the better. In addition to a clean debt limit hike, Democrats are also willing to reopen the government, at sequester levels of spending, but only for a short time. This is why Sen. Susan Collins's (R-ME) deal fell apart on Saturday. It funded the government at sequester levels for six months.
