The median stock investment range in the five sectors for the 51 senators is between $ 100,000 and $ 365,000 , while the average range of the investments is between $ 551,000 and nearly $ 1,874,000 .\nNot only are the senators far wealthier than most of their constituents , but they \u2019 re in a prime position to increase their wealth via policymaking .\nIt \u2019 s not illegal for members of Congress to have personal financial stakes in the industries on which they legislate . But such investments raise questions about lawmakers \u2019 motivations . If a representative on the House financial services committee owns hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stock in Bank of America , how might this investment affect their questioning of Bank of America \u2019 s CEO in a hearing ? Could it influence how they legislate and vote on banking issues ?\nWhile some members of Congress do try to limit possible conflicts of interest others claim their personal finances could never influence their conduct as elected representatives of the people , or fail to acknowledge concerns about their finances .\nSenator Joe Manchin , the ranking member on the Senate energy and natural resources committee , owns between $ 1m and $ 5m worth of non-public stock in his family coal business , Enersystems , making him the only Democratic senator who is directly profiting from the environmentally devastating coal business .\nDespite pressure from the left , the Senate minority leader , Chuck Schumer , made Manchin the ranking member of the committee , and Manchin did not divest his coal holdings .\nSome senators want to do away with these perceived conflicts of interest . Senator Elizabeth Warren introduced anti-corruption legislation in August 2018 that included a ban on members of Congress , senior congressional staff , cabinet secretaries , White House staff , federal judges and other officials from owning individual stocks , bonds , commodities , futures and other types of securities while in office .\nThe senators Sherrod Brown and Jeff Merkley introduced the Ban Conflicted Trading Act in December to prevent members of Congress and senior staff from trading individual corporate stocks .\nSenators own between $ 28.1m and $ 95.6m worth of stock in the five sectors examined by Sludge and \u2588\u2588\u2588 . They have the most money invested in the finance , insurance and real estate sector due in part to the Republican senator John Hoeven \u2019 s investment in Westbrand , Inc , a private holding company that owns multiple banks , worth between roughly $ 5m and $ 25m .\nAltogether , 37 senators and their spouses own between $ 12.8m and $ 48.2m worth of stock in the finance , insurance and real estate sector . They have the most money invested in the commercial banking industry , between $ 8.3m and $ 32.9m .\nSenator Richard Shelby , a Republican member of the Senate banking , housing and urban affairs committee , owns between $ 1m and $ 5m worth of stock in private real estate insurance firm Tuscaloosa Title Company . Shelby sits on the housing , transportation and community development subcommittee , which has jurisdiction over the US Department of Housing and Urban Development , affordable housing , foreclosure mitigation and other housing matters , and the securities , insurance and investment subcommittee , which oversees the insurance industry .\nNine other banking committee members are personally invested in the financial companies they oversee including the Republican John Kennedy and the Democrats Doug Jones , Robert Menendez and Tina Smith .\nThe same phenomenon of senators owning stock in industries they oversee exists in many other Senate committees .\nSenators have between $ 8.3m and $ 22m invested in the communications and electronics sector , including up to $ 4.2m in internet companies and as much as $ 4.1m in computer software businesses . Senator Shelley Moore Capito , a member of the commerce , science , and transportation committee \u2019 s subcommittee on communications , technology , innovation and the internet and the subcommittee on manufacturing , trade and consumer protection , owns between $ 53,000 and $ 194,000 worth of Microsoft stock , as much as $ 99,000 of Intel stock and up to $ 30,000 each in AT & T and Verizon stock .\nSenator Jacky Rosen , who is also on both subcommittees , owns between $ 310,000 and $ 1m worth of communications and electronics stock . Her largest potential investments are as much as $ 265,000 in Amazon , up to $ 115,000 in AT & T and $ 100,000 in software company Adobe .\nEnergy and natural resources companies come up frequently in the senators \u2019 investments ; members own between $ 3.5m and $ 13.9m in stocks in this sector . As the world hurtles towards a potential climate catastrophe by 2030 , senators own as much as $ 6.1m worth of stock in oil and gas companies . In addition , members have between $ 1.1m and $ 2.8m invested in electric and natural gas utilities stocks .\nWhile medical debt piles up and tens of millions of Americans are still uninsured , senators own as much as $ 9.5m in health sector companies including insurers UnitedHealth Group and Anthem , pharmaceutical companies Abbott Labs , Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer , and pharmacy benefit manager CVS Health .\nWhile the financial sector has drawn the most investment dollars from senators , stocks in the internet and computer software and hardware industries are the most popular .\nFifteen senators own stock in Apple and in Microsoft ; eleven are invested in Amazon and in Intel , and 10 own stock in Google \u2019 s parent company , Alphabet .\nRepublicans tend to be more eager to invest in corporate stocks ; of the 25 most popular public stocks , Democrats invested outnumber Republicans in only three companies : General Electric , MetLife , and Pfizer .

Ownership in Amazon , which is vying for a $ 10bn defense contract , is not far behind at between $ 423,000 and $ 1.3m .\nWells Fargo , the financial giant that has paid numerous fines for its frequently fraudulent practices , is the bank that has attracted the most investment dollars from senators : as much as $ 1.5m . Also among the top stocks are telecom companies Crown Castle International ( $ 385,000 to $ 1.2m ) , Verizon ( $ 407,000 to $ 1m ) , and AT & T ( $ 250,000 to $ 925,000 ) .\nBecause of Hoeven \u2019 s big investment in Westbrand Bank Holding Company , he has by far the most money in corporate stocks from the five sectors analyzed by Sludge and \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nIn terms of total stock ownership in the five sectors , Senator Dianne Feinstein , who along with husband Richard Blum , an investment banker , is second , with up to $ 7m invested in the five sectors .
