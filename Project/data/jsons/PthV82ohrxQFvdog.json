    "content": "George Papadopoulos , who served as a foreign policy adviser to Donald Trump \u2019 s presidential campaign , has pleaded guilty to making false statements to FBI agents . He admits he lied about repeated contacts during the campaign with people he believed had ties to the Russian government .\nPapadopoulos is the first to plead guilty in the federal investigation into the Russian government \u2019 s attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election and whether Trump \u2019 s campaign associates were involved in those efforts .\nOf course , it \u2019 s a crime to intentionally mislead federal prosecutors .\nIt \u2019 s not a crime , however , to give inaccurate information to the media and the public \u2014 intentionally or unintentionally . And there have been instances in which Trump administration and campaign officials have made public statements about issues concerning Russia that turned out not to be true .\nA few days after Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election , Russia \u2019 s deputy foreign minister , Sergei A. Ryabkov , told Interfax news agency that the Russian government maintained contact with Trump \u2019 s \u201c immediate entourage \u201d during the campaign .\n\u201c There were contacts , \u201d Ryabkov told the news agency , as reported by The New York Times on Nov. 10 , 2016 . \u201c We continue to do this and have been doing this work during the campaign . \u201d\n\u201c I don \u2019 t say that all of them , but a whole array of them supported contacts with Russian representatives , \u201d Ryabkov said of Trump campaign officials , as reported by the Associated Press .\nHope Hicks , who was Trump \u2019 s campaign spokeswoman and now serves as the White House communications director , denied that there were contacts with \u201c any foreign entity during the campaign . \u201d\n\u201c We are not aware of any campaign representatives that were in touch with any foreign entities before yesterday , when Mr. Trump spoke with many world leaders . Those discussions were congratulatory and forward looking , \u201d Hicks was quoted as saying in the Times .\nIn the Associated Press article , Hicks was quoted as saying , \u201c It never happened . There was no communication between the campaign and any foreign entity during the campaign . \u201d\nAs for the president-elect , Trump tweeted on the day of the Times report : \u201c FAKE NEWS \u2013 A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCHHUNT . \u201d\nMonths later , Fox News \u2019 Chris Wallace asked Vice President-elect Pence on Jan. 15 if there was \u201c any contact in any way between Trump or his associates and the Kremlim or cutouts they had. \u201d Pence answered , \u201c Of course not . Why would there be any contacts between the campaign ? \u201d\nBut we now know several Trump campaign officials were in contact with Russian government officials or representatives , or with people they believed were Russian government representatives , who offered government \u201c dirt \u201d on Clinton .\nPapadopoulos , who became a campaign adviser in March 2016 , met on April 26 , 2016 , in London with a professor who he \u201c understood to have substantial connections to Russian government officials , \u201d according to a statement from the Justice Department stipulating the facts of Papadopoulos \u2019 guilty plea .\nThe professor , whose name has been withheld by the Justice Department , told Papadopoulos \u201c that he had just returned from a trip to Moscow where he had met with high-level Russian government officials \u201d who told him that the Russian government had \u201c dirt \u201d on Clinton \u201c in the form of \u2018 thousands of emails , ' \u201d the Justice Department said .\nPapadopoulos remained in contact with the professor , who also introduced Papadopoulos to two others : a \u201c Female Russian National , \u201d who Papadopoulos believed had \u201c connections to Russian government officials , \u201d and \u201c an individual in Moscow \u2026 who told defendant Papadopoulos he had connections to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , \u201d according to the Justice Department statement .\nIn his initial interview with the FBI on Jan. 27 , Papadopoulos lied about his contacts with the Russians . He claimed that he was told about the damaging emails before he joined the campaign and that his contacts with the professor and the female Russian national were inconsequential . Although asked about whether he met any other Russians , Papadopoulos failed to disclose that he also had contacts with the individual who purported to be with the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs .\nIt is not clear from the Justice Department statement how long these contacts continued and what became of them . The so-called \u201c Statement of the Offense \u201d does not \u201c constitute all of the facts known to the parties concerning the charged offense , \u201d but rather just \u201c selected events \u201d to demonstrate that \u201c sufficient facts exist \u201d to prove the defendant is guilty , the Justice Department said .\nSimilarly , Trump \u2019 s eldest son , Donald Trump Jr. , had contact with Russians during the campaign with the understanding that the Russian government had damaging information about Clinton that could help the Trump campaign .\nIn a March 2017 interview with The New York Times , Donald Trump Jr. denied that he had ever \u201c set up \u201d any meetings with Russians and \u201c certainly none that I was representing the campaign in any way , shape or form. \u201d Trump also denied that he ever discussed government policies related to Russia with any Russians .\nAlthough this denial was unpublished at the time , the paper included it in a July 8 story revealing that Trump Jr. met with a Russian attorney linked to the Kremlin on June 9 , 2016 : \u201c Did I meet with people that were Russian ? I \u2019 m sure , I \u2019 m sure I did , \u201d he said in that March interview . \u201c But none that were set up . None that I can think of at the moment . And certainly none that I was representing the campaign in any way , shape or form . \u201d\nAs we wrote on July 13 , none of that turned out to be true .\nIn response to the Times \u2019 July reporting , Trump Jr. initially issued a statement that misleadingly claimed the meeting was \u201c primarily \u201d to discuss \u201c a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government . \u201d\nThe emails and a subsequent statement released by Trump Jr. , however , revealed that the meeting was explicitly about promised dirt on the soon-to-be Democratic presidential nominee from a purported \u201c Russian government attorney. \u201d Furthermore , Trump Jr. was told in an email that it was \u201c part of Russia and its government \u2019 s support for Mr. Trump . \u201d\nTrump Jr. responded by saying , \u201c [ I ] f it \u2019 s what you say I love it especially later in the summer . \u201d\nNot only did Trump Jr. represent the campaign at that June 9 , 2016 , meeting , but he requested that the president \u2019 s son-in-law and now senior adviser , Jared Kushner , and Paul Manafort , then-campaign convention manager , attend the meeting with him .\nWhen first confronted by The New York Times about the meeting , Trump Jr. issued a statement that was , at best , misleading by omission .\n\u201c It was a short introductory meeting , \u201d Trump Jr. \u2019 s statement read . \u201c I asked Jared [ Kushner ] and Paul [ Manafort ] to stop by . We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government , but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up . \u201d\nAs we described above , there was more to the meeting than that statement let on .\nOn July 12 , Jay Sekulow , an attorney on the president \u2019 s legal team , distanced the president from that statement , saying on Good Morning America : \u201c The president didn \u2019 t sign off on anything . He was coming back from the G-20 . The statement that was released on Saturday was released by Donald Trump Jr. , I \u2019 m sure in consultation with his lawyers . The president wasn \u2019 t involved in that. \u201d Told that The New York Times reported that the president was involved , Sekulow said , \u201c That \u2019 s incorrect . \u201d\nOn July 16 , Sekulow said on Meet the Press : \u201c I do want to be clear \u2014 that the president was not involved in the drafting of the statement and did not issue the statement . It came from Donald Trump Jr . \u201d\nThose statements were later contradicted by White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on Aug. 1 .\n\u201c The president weighed in , as any father would , based on the limited information that he had , \u201d Sander said at a press briefing . \u201c He certainly didn \u2019 t dictate , but like I said , he weighed in , offered suggestion like any father would do . \u201d\nOn Jan. 10 , the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on Trump \u2019 s nominee for U.S. attorney general , Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama .\nSen. Al Franken , a Democrat , asked Sessions : \u201c [ I ] f there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign , what will you do ? \u201d Sessions replied , \u201c I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn \u2019 t have \u2014 did not have communications with the Russians . \u201d\nThat turned out to be false . Sessions did have communications with the Russians .\nAt a March 2 press conference , Sessions acknowledged that he had at least two meetings with Sergey Kislyak , the Russian ambassador to the U.S. , during the campaign \u2014 including a Sept. 8 , 2016 , meeting in the senator \u2019 s office . The attorney general said none of his meetings with Kislyak were related to the campaign , but he admitted he should have disclosed them .\n\u201c In retrospect , I should have slowed down and said , \u2018 But I did meet one Russian official a couple of times . That would be the ambassador , \u2019 \u201d Sessions said at the press conference , which was held a day after The Washington Post broke the story of Sessions \u2019 meetings with Kislyak during the campaign .\nAt the press conference , Sessions also announced that he would recuse himself from any matters involving the 2016 campaign , including the Justice Department \u2019 s investigation of Russia and the Trump campaign .\nIn May , The Washington Post reported that Kushner met during the transition in December 2016 with Kislyak and \u201c discussed the possibility of setting up a secret and secure communications channel between Trump \u2019 s transition team and the Kremlin . \u201d\nAt a May 30 press briefing , then-White House press secretary Sean Spicer dismissed the Post report as \u201c not substantiated by anything but anonymous sources . \u201d\nEarlier that day , Trump retweeted a Fox & Friends tweet that said , \u201c Jared Kushner didn \u2019 t suggest Russian communications channel in meeting , source says . \u201d\nHowever , Kushner would later confirm that he did suggest setting up a secure communications channel using Russian equipment .\nIn a statement to congressional investigators on July 24 , Kushner said Kislyak \u201c wanted to convey information from what he called his \u2018 generals \u2019 \u201d about \u201c U.S . policy in Syria. \u201d Kushner said the exchange of information did not occur during the transition because neither party could arrange a secure line of communication .\n\u201c I asked if they had an existing communications channel at his embassy we could use where they would be comfortable transmitting the information they wanted to relay to General [ Michael ] Flynn [ Trump \u2019 s national security adviser ] . The Ambassador said that would not be possible and so we all agreed that we would receive this information after the Inauguration . Nothing else occurred , \u201d Kushner \u2019 s statement reads .\nOn Jan. 12 , eight days before Trump \u2019 s inauguration , The Washington Post reported that Flynn spoke with Kislyak on Dec. 29 , 2016 . That was the same day that President Obama announced sanctions against Russia in response to the country \u2019 s cyber operations aimed at interfering in the U.S. election . Trump administration officials denied that Flynn \u2019 s phone conversation was about the sanctions . But about a month later , the administration acknowledged the two men did talk about the sanctions .\nThe day of the Post story , Spicer said : \u201c The call centered on the logistics of setting up a call with the president of Russia and the president-elect after he was sworn in . \u2026 That was it , plain and simple . \u201d\nOn Jan. 15 , Pence said on CBS News \u2019 Face the Nation that Flynn and Kislyak \u201c did not discuss anything having to do with the United States \u2019 decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia. \u201d The timing of the call , Pence said , was \u201c strictly coincidental . \u201d\nOn Feb. 9 , however , the Post reported , citing anonymous current and former government officials , that Flynn had \u201c privately discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia \u201d with Kislyak in December . Flynn , the Post reported , initially on Feb. 8 denied that he had discussed sanctions , but then backed away from that denial the following day .\nA spokesman for Flynn told the newspaper on Feb. 9 that Flynn \u201c indicated that while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions , he couldn \u2019 t be certain that the topic never came up . \u201d\nFlynn resigned on Feb. 13 , saying in a letter that \u201c I inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador. \u201d The next day , Spicer confirmed at his daily press briefing that Flynn and Kislyak spoke about the sanctions .\nSpicer also told reporters in that briefing that the White House had known \u201c for a few weeks \u201d that the two men had talked about the sanctions . But on Feb. 10 , President Trump said he \u201c didn \u2019 t know about it , \u201d when asked about news reports on the matter by the Post and other outlets .\nTrump fired FBI Director James Comey on May 9 . The White House issued a statement that day saying that Trump acted \u201c based on the clear recommendations of both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions . \u201d\nRosenstein had written a two-and-a-half page memo that cited Comey \u2019 s \u201c handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary [ Hillary ] Clinton \u2019 s emails , \u201d as a reason for Comey \u2019 s firing .\nOn CNN on May 9 , White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway said the firing \u201c had zero to do \u201d with Russia and \u201c everything to do with \u2026 Mr. Rosenstein. \u201d The next morning , Conway again said on CNN : \u201c The president took the advice of the deputy attorney general who oversees the director of the FBI , brought those concerns to the attorney general who brought them to the president . And they made a decision to remove him . \u201d\nOn MSNBC the same day , White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders reiterated that Trump \u201c took the recommendation [ by Rosenstein ] seriously . And he made a decision based on that . \u201d\nBut Trump himself contradicted the official White House statements . On May 11 , the president said he thought about \u201c this Russia thing \u201d when he decided to fire Comey . He told NBC \u2019 s Lester Holt that \u201c regardless of [ Rosenstein \u2019 s ] recommendation I was going to fire Comey . \u201d\nRosenstein later would tell Congress that he knew Trump was going to fire Comey before he wrote his memo . \u201c On May 8 , I learned that President Trump intended to remove Director Comey and sought my advice and input . Notwithstanding my personal affection for Director Comey , I thought it was appropriate to seek a new leader , \u201d he said . Rosenstein then set out to write a memo outlining his concerns about Comey \u2019 s leadership .\nMichael Flynn faces legal peril in Washington .

Why would there be any contacts between the campaign?\u201d\n\nBut we now know several Trump campaign officials were in contact with Russian government officials or representatives, or with people they believed were Russian government representatives, who offered government \u201cdirt\u201d on Clinton.\n\nPapadopoulos and the Professor\n\nPapadopoulos, who became a campaign adviser in March 2016, met on April 26, 2016, in London with a professor who he \u201cunderstood to have substantial connections to Russian government officials,\u201d according to a statement from the Justice Department stipulating the facts of Papadopoulos\u2019 guilty plea.\n\nThe professor, whose name has been withheld by the Justice Department, told Papadopoulos \u201cthat he had just returned from a trip to Moscow where he had met with high-level Russian government officials\u201d who told him that the Russian government had \u201cdirt\u201d on Clinton \u201cin the form of \u2018thousands of emails,'\u201d the Justice Department said.\n\nPapadopoulos remained in contact with the professor, who also introduced Papadopoulos to two others: a \u201cFemale Russian National,\u201d who Papadopoulos believed had \u201cconnections to Russian government officials,\u201d and \u201can individual in Moscow \u2026 who told defendant Papadopoulos he had connections to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs,\u201d according to the Justice Department statement.\n\nIn his initial interview with the FBI on Jan. 27, Papadopoulos lied about his contacts with the Russians.

Jeff Sessions of Alabama.\n\nSen. Al Franken, a Democrat, asked Sessions: \u201c[I]f there is any evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign, what will you do?\u201d Sessions replied, \u201cI have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn\u2019t have \u2014 did not have communications with the Russians.\u201d\n\nThat turned out to be false.

Flynn, the Post reported, initially on Feb. 8 denied that he had discussed sanctions, but then backed away from that denial the following day.\n\nA spokesman for Flynn told the newspaper on Feb. 9 that Flynn \u201cindicated that while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions, he couldn\u2019t be certain that the topic never came up.\u201d\n\nFlynn resigned on Feb. 13, saying in a letter that \u201cI inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador.\u201d The next day, Spicer confirmed at his daily press briefing that Flynn and Kislyak spoke about the sanctions.\n\nSpicer also told reporters in that briefing that the White House had known \u201cfor a few weeks\u201d that the two men had talked about the sanctions. But on Feb. 10, President Trump said he \u201cdidn\u2019t know about it,\u201d when asked about news reports on the matter by the Post and other outlets.\n\nComey Firing Had \u2018Zero to Do\u2019 with Russia?\n\nTrump fired FBI Director James Comey on May 9. The White House issued a statement that day saying that Trump acted \u201cbased on the clear recommendations of both Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\u201d\n\nRosenstein had written a two-and-a-half page memo that cited Comey\u2019s \u201chandling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary [Hillary] Clinton\u2019s emails,\u201d as a reason for Comey\u2019s firing.\n\nOn CNN on May 9, White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway said the firing \u201chad zero to do\u201d with Russia and \u201ceverything to do with \u2026 Mr. Rosenstein.\u201d The next morning, Conway again said on CNN: \u201cThe president took the advice of the deputy attorney general who oversees the director of the FBI, brought those concerns to the attorney general who brought them to the president. And they made a decision to remove him.\u201d\n\nOn MSNBC the same day, White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders reiterated that Trump \u201ctook the recommendation [by Rosenstein] seriously. And he made a decision based on that.\u201d\n\nBut Trump himself contradicted the official White House statements. On May 11, the president said he thought about \u201cthis Russia thing\u201d when he decided to fire Comey. He told NBC\u2019s Lester Holt that \u201cregardless of [Rosenstein\u2019s] recommendation I was going to fire Comey.\u201d\n\nRosenstein later would tell Congress that he knew Trump was going to fire Comey before he wrote his memo. \u201cOn May 8, I learned that President Trump intended to remove Director Comey and sought my advice and input. Notwithstanding my personal affection for Director Comey, I thought it was appropriate to seek a new leader,\u201d he said. Rosenstein then set out to write a memo outlining his concerns about Comey\u2019s leadership.\n\nMore from USA TODAY:\n\nWho's who: Key players in the Russia investigation\n\nMichael Flynn faces legal peril in Washington.
