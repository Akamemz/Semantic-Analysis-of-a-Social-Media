Malaysia Airlines is sending investigators to France and a second team to Reunion , an airline official said .\nMary Schiavo , a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general of the U.S. Department of Transportation , said those involved would be careful to make sure all tests were carried out scientifically , and completely by the book .\nShe said that while `` everyone knows that it most likely is from MH370 , '' investigators do not want to jump to conclusions .\n`` They 're going to do a lot of analysis on the part , everything from X-rays to sonograms , '' Schiavo said . `` Then when they finally cut it open ( looking for serial numbers and part numbers ) , it has to be filmed , all the parties to the investigation -- there are seven nations in this investigation -- they all need to be present .

''\nThrough the French laboratory near Toulouse , `` engineers would be able to identify quickly whether the plane exploded in the air or whether it broke when hitting the water , '' the source close to the French investigation said .\nImages of the component appear to show a small amount of damage to the front of the flaperon and a ragged horizontal tear across the back .\nOne group of independent observers has said that the damage to the flaperon should give authorities a good indication that the piece came off while the plane was still in the air .\nThe rear damage could have been caused if the airliner had its flaperon down as it went into the ocean , some members of the group , led by American Mobile Satellite Corp. co-founder Mike Exner , wrote in a preliminary assessment .\nJUST WATCHED # MH370Qs : Experts answer your questions Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH # MH370Qs : Experts answer your questions 04:38\nBut the lack of damage to the front makes it more likely the plane was in a high-speed , steep , spiral descent and the part fluttered until it broke off , the group said .\nIf the flaperon were still on the wing when the plane hit water , the front would have been damaged by hitting the part of the wing to which it was attached , the group says .\n`` It really is not going to tell us too much about the final moments of the aircraft , '' said Geoffrey Thomas from AirlineRatings.com\nHowever , Tom Ballantyne of Orient Aviation magazine said the condition of debris could indicate if the plane met a catastrophic end . Charring , for example , could indicate an explosion , he said .\nSciavo said investigators would be on the look out for tell-tale signs of what caused the crash : `` It 's possible to find positive evidence of a criminal act , or , of course they could find the absence of that .\n`` If they find characteristic pitting in the wing structure , in the metal or the composite , that indicates there was some sort of explosive device , or if they find residue , which is not likely ( after ) this long in he ocean , '' she said .\n`` But they 'll probably not be able to tell why the plane went down -- only that it did , and the manner in which it did . ''\nTo learn more , the flight data recorders -- or so-called black boxes -- will be crucial .\nIf it is from MH370 , will the main search area move ?\nTruss told a press conference Friday that the discovery of the debris in Reunion was `` consistent with some of the modeling we 've done . ''\n`` We remain confident that we 're searching in the right place , '' he said .\nHe said authorities would `` continue to concentrate our efforts on seeking to locate the aircraft in the identified area . ''\nThe current search is focused deep in the ocean off Western Australia , along an arc considered by investigators to be the most likely area the plane went down if it turned back toward Malaysia , as indicated by data , and stayed in the air before running out of fuel .\nThe southern end of the search area was the main focus , Truss said , but during the winter months weather conditions at that latitude were poor .\nOnce that search was completed , he said , searchers would focus efforts on a second identified area of interest .\nIf it 's part of the plane , is it more likely the main section will be found ?\nTruss said that if the flaperon is proven to be from MH370 , its discovery did not `` provide a great deal of help in specifically identifying where the aircraft is . ''\nIf confirmed , however , the find is likely to give investigators further belief that other pieces of the plane have been carried by currents to the same region .\nThomas said , if anything , the location of the potential debris confirms modeling from the University of Western Australia that showed material from the plane could wash up around Reunion between 12 to 24 months after the plane 's disappearance .\nDespite the modeling , no one had been searching in that area , he said , because of the vast nature of the Indian Ocean and the multitude of factors that meant finding anything would be matter of luck and time .\n`` It was a matter of waiting for something to wash up , '' he said .\nHowever , Truss said , a positive identification with MH370 would rule out the some of the more left-field theories that the aircraft was `` secretly parked in some hidden place '' on land .",
