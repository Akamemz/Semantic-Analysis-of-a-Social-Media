    "content": "Manchester , New Hampshire ( CNN ) It was the revenge of the governors as Republicans met for their final debate before the Granite State 's primary on Tuesday .\nNew Jersey Gov . Chris Christie knocked the rising Florida Sen. Marco Rubio down several pegs , while former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush went toe-to-toe with billionaire businessman Donald Trump and equaled or got the better of his nemesis . Ohio Gov . John Kasich , meanwhile , stayed with his positive game and seized opportunities to tout his own record .\nHere are five takeaways from Saturday night 's debate on ABC as the primary clock counts down .\nAfter a stronger-than-expected third-place finish in Iowa -- and taking a clear lead over other `` establishment '' candidates -- Rubio knew he 'd be wearing a big target Saturday night .\nBut whether he was over-rehearsed or under-prepared , Rubio was off-key as he responded to the attacks .\nFrom the debate 's outset , he pestered Rubio . `` You have not been involved in a consequential decision where you had to be held accountable , '' he said .\nBut he then opened up a brutal line of attack in suggesting that the Florida senator only knew how to turn a phrase rather than accomplish something .\n`` Marco , the thing is this , '' Christie said . `` When you 're president of the United States , when you 're a governor of a state , the memorized 30-second speech where you talk about how great America is at the end of it does n't solve one problem for one person . ''\nIn answering Christie , Rubio consistently turned to the same talking point , casting President Barack Obama as calculating rather than incompetent , and intent on changing America for the worse .\nThe fourth time he invoked Obama , though , the audience turned on him , booing the answer . And then moderator David Muir drove in the knife , saying : `` The governor was n't talking about the President . ''\nRubio rebounded a bit near the debate 's end , when he hammered Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for supporting abortion rights -- and won applause from the audience for it .\nOf Democrats , Rubio said : `` They are the extremists on the issue of abortion , and I ca n't wait to expose them in a general election . ''\nChristie , Kasich and Bush know that since they 're all competing for the same pool of more moderate voters , there probably are n't enough tickets out of New Hampshire 's primary for all three .\nBut the trio were still happy to unite in attacking the senators in the race ( and , in Bush 's case , Trump ) .\nThe only mild governor-on-governor criticism came from Christie , who noted that Kasich had increased the number of Ohio 's government employees . But that followed praise of Kasich 's job performance , with Christie saying he 'd `` done a great job in Ohio . ''\nAnd Bush , in arguing that money and authority should shift from the federal government to the states , said : `` I trust Kasich and Christie to build the roads in their states . ''\nAll three turned in strong performances Saturday night -- and their timing could n't have been better , given Rubio 's on-stage struggles and New Hampshire 's reputation for voters who make their decisions at the last minute .\nKasich played up his time as the House 's lead budget-writer during the surpluses of the 1990s and his record in turning a deficit into a surplus in Ohio .\nBush effectively traded blows with Trump , lighting into him on eminent domain with a brutal response to the real estate mogul 's accusations that Bush wanted to sound tough : `` How tough is it to take property from an elderly woman ? ''\nAnd Christie , who risked coming across as a bully in order to knock Rubio down early in the debate , was moving when he talked about drug addiction , linking his position on helping addicts to his stance opposing abortion , saying he wants to support kids after they 're born as well as before .\n`` I 'm pro-life when they get out , and it 's a lot more complicated , '' he said .\nStill , there are two big questions : Is it too little , too late ? And on a Saturday night , how many New Hampshire voters were watching ?\nThey 've bashed each other on the campaign trail in recent days , but Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Trump -- the two top-finishing candidates in Iowa 's caucuses -- seemed to want nothing to do with each other on the debate stage .\nIt was one fight that was conspicuously absent Saturday night , and it contributed to Rubio 's awful night . The Florida senator might have been hoping that those two would bash each other -- but it did n't happen , and he clearly was Enemy No . 1 .\nCruz had a revealing answer when asked who he expects will win the Super Bowl : `` With an eye toward February 20 , Carolina , '' he said , alluding to the South Carolina primary .\nWhy it matters : New Hampshire 's more moderate electorate means it 's not a state where Cruz is likely to shine . He could , though , win in South Carolina -- and his campaign 's strategy largely relies on racking up delegates in Southern states with March primaries .\nTrump 's answers were revealing in their own way , demonstrating that his support is n't about an ideological opposition to big government as much as a desire for strength and a sense that the government is incompetent .\nAt one point , he defended eminent domain , a practice he 's used as a real estate developer . Later Trump backed the role of government-sponsored health care , saying : `` You 're not gon na let people die sitting in the middle of the street in any city in this country .

Rubio's rough night\n\nAfter a stronger-than-expected third-place finish in Iowa -- and taking a clear lead over other \"establishment\" candidates -- Rubio knew he'd be wearing a big target Saturday night.\n\nBut whether he was over-rehearsed or under-prepared, Rubio was off-key as he responded to the attacks.\n\nThe opponent responsible for most of them: Christie.\n\nFrom the debate's outset, he pestered Rubio. \"You have not been involved in a consequential decision where you had to be held accountable,\" he said.\n\nBut he then opened up a brutal line of attack in suggesting that the Florida senator only knew how to turn a phrase rather than accomplish something.\n\n\"Marco, the thing is this,\" Christie said. \"When you're president of the United States, when you're a governor of a state, the memorized 30-second speech where you talk about how great America is at the end of it doesn't solve one problem for one person.\"\n\nIn answering Christie, Rubio consistently turned to the same talking point, casting President Barack Obama as calculating rather than incompetent, and intent on changing America for the worse.\n\nThe fourth time he invoked Obama, though, the audience turned on him, booing the answer.

Trump vs. Cruz: The fight that didn't happen\n\nThey've bashed each other on the campaign trail in recent days, but Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Trump -- the two top-finishing candidates in Iowa's caucuses -- seemed to want nothing to do with each other on the debate stage.\n\nIt was one fight that was conspicuously absent Saturday night, and it contributed to Rubio's awful night.

An awkward start\n\nThought the 2016 debate season couldn't get any weirder?
