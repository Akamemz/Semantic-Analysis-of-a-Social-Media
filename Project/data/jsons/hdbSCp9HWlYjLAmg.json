It does not escape me that it was witnessing -- a term used to refer to an act of Christian discipleship where one shares their faith with nonbelievers -- that likely resulted in Roof \u2019 s invitation to join the weekly gathering , and it was the need for an ( eye ) witness that led him to intentionally spare the life of one of the victims .\nThe racist and terrorist act was premeditated and deemed a hate crime , even though some media pundits insisted that it was motivated by antagonism towards Christianity , not black people .
