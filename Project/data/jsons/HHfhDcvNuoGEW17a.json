Biden found himself defending Democrats of the past.\n\nThe former vice president repeatedly found himself defending Barack Obama\u2019s policies on immigration and health care when they came under withering attack, a continuation of his near-constant efforts to highlight his service to the first black president.\n\nWhile his rivals saber-rattled for \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d which would scrap Obama\u2019s signature health care law, Biden called for a more modest public option that would build on the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhen former Obama Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro criticized the high number of deportations under Obama, Biden retorted that Castro\u2019s passion about the issue appeared newfound.\n\n\u201cI never heard him talk about this when he was the secretary,\u201d Biden said.\n\nBut he also deflected when asked why he didn\u2019t do more to stop the deportations, saying it was Obama\u2019s call.

Michael Bennet derided her recently released \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan, which he said was not \u201chonest\u201d and would raise taxes to the middle class \u201cto the tune of $30 trillion.\u201d Hawaii Rep.

But at least at the beginning of the night, she seemed rattled by some of the attacks. She took some of the later hits in stride, reorienting attention back to her criticism of Biden.\n\n__\n\nWILL THERE BE A BOOKER BOUNCE?\n\nBooker needed a good debate to breathe new life into his flagging campaign. He largely succeeded.\n\nThe New Jersey senator avoided getting into nitty-gritty policy fights. But he came armed with zingers, talked about big issues and delivered many of the night\u2019s most memorable lines \u2014 often at Biden\u2019s expense.\n\n\u201cMr. Vice President, there\u2019s a saying in my community: You\u2019re dipping into the Kool-Aid and ya don\u2019t even know the flavor,\u201d Booker said to Biden when he criticized his criminal justice record as mayor of Newark.\n\nBooker went after Biden for his role in passing a 1994 crime bill that disproportionately impacted African Americans.
