But something was up because I noticed she was so nervous when she introduced me , '' Trump said in a telephone interview with `` Fox & Friends , '' saying that Bethel United Methodist Church pastor Faith Green Timmons `` was so nervous , she was shaking '' when she introduced him for his speech .\n`` I mean , everyone plays their games . It does n't bother me , \u201d he said about her decision to interrupt him when Trump started attacking Hillary Clinton from the front of the church .\n( Trump complied with the pastor \u2019 s request Wednesday to stop going after Clinton , replying , `` OK. That 's good . Then I 'm going back onto Flint , OK ? '' )\nTrump \u2019 s slam on Timmons was a return to form , after the brash billionaire scorched through the Republican primary field with a steady delivery of incendiary comments about minorities , women and his GOP rivals .\nSince elevating pollster Kellyanne Conway to be his campaign manager last month , Trump has been relatively restrained , generally sticking to the teleprompter at his speeches . He even initially refrained from delivering an \u201c I told you so \u201d when Clinton nearly collapsed after appearing at a 9/11 memorial service on Sunday . ( Her campaign initially said she was \u201c overheated \u201d but later revealed that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia . )\nBut on Wednesday night , Trump apparently couldn \u2019 t resist , and he again questioned Clinton \u2019 s stamina during a rally in Canton , Ohio .\n`` You think this is easy ? In this beautiful room that is 122 degrees , '' Trump said , although the arena was notably chillier than his usual venues . `` It is hot and it is always hot when I perform , because the crowds are so big , these rooms were not designed for this kind of crowd . \u201d\n`` I do n't know , folks , do you think Hillary could stand up here for an hour ? '' he asked .\nOn Thursday afternoon , Clinton fired back at Trump , not for his latest attacks on her , but for his attack on the pastor . She appeared to relish the opportunity to take the high ground Trump afforded her .\n\u201c Reverend Faith Green Timmons is not a nervous mess , she is a rock for her community in trying times , \u201d Clinton said at a press conference that followed a rally in Greensboro , North Carolina . \u201c She deserves better than that . And Flint deserves better . In fact , so does America . So I 'm going to keep working as hard as I can to lift up our country , not tear it apart . \u201d\nAnd while Clinton has long battled her reputation for secrecy ( during the press conference she refused to say when she told her running mater Tim Kaine about her pneumonia diagnosis ) , Trump is also on the defensive for his refusal to reveal details about his business dealings and charitable giving .\nDuring the two-part interview on Fox News on Thursday morning , Trump offered an explanation about his willingness to be more transparent about his medical information to television host and doctor Mehmet Oz and more broadly , why he is talking about it in the first place .\n`` I did every test . I did it last week , and the samples all came back , and I guess I would n't be talking to you right now if they were bad . If they were bad , I would say let 's sort of skip this , right ? '' Trump said .\nThe candidate was not asked , however , whether the same logic applied to the release of his tax returns , for which Vice News filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the IRS earlier this week , demanding to see all documents dating back to 2002 . Trump has said that he will not release any returns while they are under audit , as all documents from 2009 onward are , according to the campaign .\nCritics have speculated that he does n't want to reveal his level of charitable giving and how he may have taken advantage of loopholes to pay a low tax rate , or no taxes at all .\nEven within his familiar confines of \u201c Fox & Friends , \u201d Trump faced down questions about what he would do about his businesses \u2019 ties to foreign countries . The entanglements represent a lingering issue raised anew this week by a Newsweek report Wednesday suggesting that the Trump Organization \u2019 s foreign ties could \u201c upend U.S. national security . \u201d\n`` Well , I will sever connections and I 'll have my children and my executives run the company , '' Trump said . `` And I wo n't discuss it with them . It 's just so unimportant compared to what we 're doing about making America great again . I just would n't care . I guess you can say there 's a conflict because as the company \u2014 country \u2014 gets stronger , that 's good for all companies , right ? But I would n't care . It 's so unimportant compared to what I 'm doing right now . ''\nThe businessman , who has repeatedly said he would place his assets in a blind trust managed by his children and executives , also said that if he were president , his companies would leave countries where sanctions were imposed .\n\u201c I would n't be able to be involved and then nobody else is able to , but I do n't think we have too many of those companies , quite frankly , '' Trump said . `` It 's a very interesting question . I would get out . I would get out of those countries . ''\nCampaign surrogate and New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie defended Trump \u2019 s approach the previous night on MSNBC .\n\u201c I think , listen , the father and the children have a lot of things to talk about other than the business . They have grandchildren , many of them , \u201d Christie remarked . \u201c He 's involved in every aspect of their life and they in his . And I think that these are professional , smart people who will , as we can see with his tax returns , follow the advice of their lawyers and their accountants . ''\nWhen host Brian Williams remarked that experts would not necessarily characterize the trust as \u201c blind , \u201d Christie volunteered that he has had a blind trust in the seven years since he became governor and has no knowledge of how his investments are performing , adding that he had \u201c absolute faith \u201d that Trump \u2019 s children could run the business independently of their father .\n\u201c I know what it was like when I went in seven years ago , but lots of things will change , and in a dynamic business like the Trump Organization , a lot of those assets will change over the course of the time he \u2019 s president , \u201d the New Jersey governor said . \u201c And if that wall is up and the trust is absolutely blind , he wo n't know how it 's changed until he leaves the presidency and goes back to ask his kids what 's happened over the past number of years . \u201c\nTrump 's slippage in message discipline was not limited to him . Trump \u2019 s children \u2014 who also serve as some of his chief surrogates \u2014 also offered up some unhelpful headlines .\nDonald Trump Jr. , responding to a question about the lack of disclosure on tax returns , suggested in a meeting of Tribune-Review editors and reporters on Wednesday that the release of his father \u2019 s would be a distraction .\n\u201c Because he 's got a 12,000-page tax return that would create \u2026 financial auditors out of every person in the country asking questions that would detract from [ his father 's ] main message , '' Trump Jr. said .\nThat is a slightly different answer than his father \u2019 s repeated insistence that he would not release them while some are under audit from the IRS , specifically those from 2009 forward .\nIn a separate interview with a Philadelphia radio station Wednesday morning , Trump Jr. lamented the media 's treatment of his father 's campaign , referencing the `` gas chamber . ''\n\u201c The media has been [ Clinton 's ] No . 1 surrogate in this . Without the media , this wouldn \u2019 t even be a contest , but the media has built her up . They \u2019 ve let her slide on every indiscrepancy , on every lie , on every DNC game trying to get Bernie Sanders out of this thing , '' he said . `` If Republicans were doing that , they \u2019 d be warming up the gas chamber right now . \u201d\nBoth Trump and Trump Jr. have made similar comments in the past , with the candidate remarking in May that he would get `` the electric chair '' if he had , like former Mexican President Vicente Fox , used the F-word . ( Trump spokesman Jason Miller later said Trump Jr. was `` clearly referring to capital punishment to make the case that the media continues to take words out of context in order to serve as the propaganda arm of the Hillary Clinton campaign . '' )\nAnother Trump Jr. face-to-face with a Pittsburgh TV station aired Wednesday evening was cut short after the reporter inquired about a Washington Post story reporting that his father used foundation money to pay for a portrait of himself at an auction .\n\u201c You \u2019 re a director of the Trump Foundation charity . Did you sign off on charity money for a portrait ? \u201d WTAE reporter Bob Mayo asked in a segment with the Trump Organization executive in town to open the campaign 's western Pennsylvania headquarters .\nTrump Jr. responded , `` No , I do n't know anything about that . '' Before the reporter could follow up , a voice off-camera said , `` All right . That 's it ... We have to move on to the next ... next one , thank you . ''\nAnd speaking to Cosmopolitan.com to promote the campaign \u2019 s new family leave plan , Ivanka Trump took issue with questioning about her father \u2019 s past comments pertaining to women .\n\u201c My father obviously has a track record of decades of employing women at every level of his company , and supporting women , and supporting them in their professional capacity , and enabling them to thrive outside of the office and within , \u201d Ivanka Trump said . \u201c To imply otherwise is an unfair characterization of his track record and his support of professional women . \u201d\nPressed again on the 2004 comments in which her father called pregnancy \u201c an inconvenience for a person that is running a business , \u201d Trump \u2019 s eldest daughter responded , \u201c Well , you said he made those comments .
