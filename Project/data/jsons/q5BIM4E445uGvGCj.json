    "content": "The Wisconsin Republican has spent two decades building a brand as a serious conservative with a friendly demeanor , who totes budget charts to town halls and is more prone to a back slap than a back stab .\nBut in the last year , Donald Trump has seized control of the Republican Party , throwing verbal daggers in every direction , and offering little in terms of policy specifics as he waltzed through the GOP presidential primary .\nThey aren \u2019 t speaking different languages . They are from different planets . Ryan has never had a job outside of Washington ; Trump hasn \u2019 t ever worked in Washington .\nBut now Ryan is having to contend with a reality : Trump is the party \u2019 s nominee , and there is nothing he can do about it .\nSo here \u2019 s the House speaker \u2019 s play , according to multiple people in Ryan \u2019 s inner circle : he wants Trump to understand where he is coming from . Ryan wants to try to steer the party \u2019 s national political dialogue \u2014 as embodied by Trump 's barbed rhetoric \u2014 in a better direction . He wants an open line of communication between his operation and Trump \u2019 s . He isn \u2019 t going to try to extract policy concessions from Trump \u2014 he understands they are unlikely to ever agree on trade or immigration \u2014 but he wants some recognition that Ryan has 247 members of the House that need to be re-elected , and they can \u2019 t do so while wincing through the general election in November .\nIt might work , it might not . Ryan could endorse Trump at some point \u2014 but there are no guarantees . His posture : at least I tried to make things work .\nOne thing is for certain : Ryan is almost certainly not going to endorse Trump after their big meeting on Thursday \u2014 he \u2019 s likely to say that the 9 a.m. confab at the Republican National Committee \u2019 s offices was just the beginning of the conversation . Might he endorse Trump at some point ? Sure , according to sources in his inner circle , but it \u2019 s unlikely to ever be a full embrace . They simply disagree on too much with too much at stake . Ryan will focus on keeping his House majority intact , while Trump focuses on defeating Hillary Clinton .\nAll of these decisions are laced with peril for Ryan . If Ryan does endorse Trump , he could be seen as caving to the New York billionaire after months of deeming his rhetoric problematic and not emblematic of the Republican Party . A Ryan endorsement could disappoint the conservative intelligentsia , which has applauded Ryan 's courage . In short , lining up with Trump is a major risk to Ryan \u2019 s brand .\nBut should he not endorse Trump , Ryan could be seen as a man who worsened a major rift within the Republican Party . He could alienate the grassroots , who helped rocket Trump to the top of the party .\n\u201c Paul doesn \u2019 t want to be an issue ; we need to beat Hillary Clinton \u2014 that \u2019 s the issue here , \u201d said South Carolina Rep.

Should he want another term as speaker of the House , he must keep in mind that he needs the support of 218 Republicans to keep the gavel . Hanging your party \u2019 s nominee out to dry is not the best show of unity .\nAnd if he wants to run for president in 2020 \u2014 which many Republicans think he does \u2014 Ryan has to be careful to keep the base engaged , by not looking like he crosschecked Trump by starving him of an endorsement . If Ryan endorses Trump , he needs to make sure he does it in a way that doesn \u2019 t compromise his own political identity .\nThe difficulty for Ryan is that Trump , by his own admission , is incredibly malleable on policy .
