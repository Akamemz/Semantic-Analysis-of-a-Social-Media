    "content": "It wasn \u2019 t that long ago that senior Department of Homeland Security officials shied away from focusing on domestic terrorism , often fearing political backlash .\nThe White House pushed the sprawling department to focus overwhelmingly on immigration enforcement , at the expense of just about everything else . DHS veterans told reporters that white supremacist terror was the FBI \u2019 s issue , not theirs . When a DHS analyst warned of far-right violence in 2009 , congressional Republicans bellowed in protest , with a lasting chilling effect . Under the Trump administration , the department disbanded a group of intelligence analysts focused on domestic terrorism . Cybersecurity staffers got shipped to the border . In the days after the massacre at a synagogue in Pittsburgh , leading DHS minds focused on the migrant caravan . And , as NBC reported , the administration cut funding for DHS grants designed to prevent radicalization .\nBut as white supremacists have terrorized communities around the country , senior officials at DHS have tried to step up their work against the threat . They fought to get that counter-radicalization money back , for instance . A consensus within the department slowly began to form : DHS exists to fight terrorism\u2014even when those terrorists are American .\nThen came the El Paso shooting , which left 22 people dead in the Texas border city . That \u2019 s when , in the words of one senior DHS official , \u201c the dam broke . \u201d\n\u201c There were robust conversations before El Paso , \u201d added that official , who spoke anonymously to discuss internal talks . \u201c Acting DHS Sec .
