Mr. Cruz has also avoided Florida , instead focusing on the other states .\nAnalysts say the divide-and-conquer strategy is not likely to succeed because it requires a lot of very informed , strategic-minded voters .

Mr. Rubio had hoped to win in Florida and Mr. Kasich in Ohio , denying Mr. Trump the massive delegate haul in each state and making a contested convention more likely .\nTheir determination to stop Mr. Trump has only grown in the last couple of days as Mr. Trump has faced increasing questions about his rhetoric and the protests it has spawned .\n\u201c We are not going to allow the Republican Party to become the party of fear and frustration and anger , \u201d Mr. Rubio said at an evening rally in Orlando .\nIn Ohio Mr. Kaiser says he knows of 20 people who support either Mr. Rubio or Mr. Cruz but who plan to vote for Mr. Kasich in an effort to deny Mr. Trump a path to victory .\n\u201c The momentum is building for Kasich in Ohio , but you don \u2019 t see that in any other state .
