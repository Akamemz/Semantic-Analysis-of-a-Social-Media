''\nThe president made the comment Friday during a speech to supporters in Roanoke , Va . Arguing that business owners got help from others along the road to success and suggesting they should pay more in taxes in return , he said : `` If you 've got a business , you did n't build that . Somebody else made that happen . ''\nRomney spokeswoman Andrea Saul told FoxNews.com on Monday that the remarks `` reflect just how unqualified he is to lead us to a real economic recovery . ''\n`` They are also insulting to the hardworking entrepreneurs , small-business owners , and job creators who are the backbone of our economy , '' she said in an email .\nThe Obama campaign , though , accused the Romney campaign of launching a `` false attack '' to distract from questions over outsourcing tied to his former company Bain Capital . Campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt defended the premise of Obama 's comment .\n`` As President Obama said , those who start businesses succeed because of their individual initiative -- their drive , hard work , and creativity , '' LaBolt said in a statement . `` But there are critical actions we must take to support businesses and encourage new ones -- that means we need the best infrastructure , a good education system , and affordable , domestic sources of clean energy . Those are investments we make not as individuals , but as Americans , and our nation as a whole benefits from them . ''\nKevin Hassett , an economist with the conservative American Enterprise Institute , said Obama 's comments are `` so far from the current debate , '' but setting the stage for the administration 's tax argument .\n`` Obama is trying to create the intellectual space to take money away from people . He 's trying to say , 'What you do on the playing field would never be possible without the help of the government , ' '' he said .\nObama 's comment Friday came just days after he urged Congress to extend tax cuts enacted during the Bush administration only to families earning less than $ 250,000 annually -- part of his argument that top earners have an obligation to pay more to trim the deficit .\n`` There are a lot of wealthy , successful Americans who agree with me because they want to give something back , '' the president said . `` If you 've been successful , you did n't get there on your own . You did n't get there on your own . I 'm always struck by people who think , well , it must be because I was just so smart . There are a lot of smart people out there . It must be because I worked harder than everybody else . Let me tell you something -- there are a whole bunch of hardworking people out there .\n`` If you were successful , somebody along the line gave you some help . There was a great teacher somewhere in your life . Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive . Somebody invested in roads and bridges .
