    "content": "Grigori Rasputin was a Russian peasant , mystic , and faith healer who gained total influence over the Russian ruler Nicholas II , and especially his wife , Alexandra . He may or may not have had success \u201c treating \u201d their son , Alexei , for hemophilia , even if it was nothing more than calming the young prince and discontinuing the aspirin his doctors had prescribed , which is an anti-coagulant . But Alexandra was convinced that Rasputin was a savior , so he completely ingratiated himself with the Romanov rulers , especially in the last year of their rule . This is from a Guardian review of a 2014 biography , Rasputin : A Short Life by Frances Welch :\nRasputin took advantage of the Russian tradition of the wandering peasant holy man , walking from village to village and reputed to have a direct connection with God ( even Tolstoy , toward the end of his life , visited one ) . He also exploited the loneliness and isolation of the last Romanov couple , Nicholas and Alexandra \u2013 the tsar a polite , indecisive man and the tsarina a German-born and English-bred granddaughter of Queen Victoria ( `` The tsarina was as happy ordering chintzes from the latest Maples catalogue as she was cultivating mystics , '' writes Welch ) , who never quite adjusted to Russian life or shed her accent ( she communicated with Nicholas in English ) . \u2026 The worse things got , the more Alexandra came to rely on Rasputin 's judgment . In the summer of 1915 , with the war going poorly for Russia , Nicholas decided to leave the capital and assume command of the Russian army . This was a moderately bad idea militarily , but it was a disastrous idea for the government , which was left in Alexandra 's hands . The tsarina was devoted to Russia , but inexperienced , and blinded by her belief in Rasputin . Under their joint direction a series of catastrophic decisions were made , as experienced ministers who disliked Rasputin were dismissed in favour of non-entities and incompetents .\nHmm . \u201c Experienced ministers who disliked Rasputin were dismissed in favor of nonentities and incompetents. \u201d The \u201c loneliness and isolation of the last Romanov couple \u201d \u2014Trump is said to have almost no friends outside his family . Does this sound familiar ?\nWriting in Salon , Heather Digby Parton ( yeah , that \u201c Digby , \u201d so I \u2019 m glad to be in good company here ) also calls Bannon Trump \u2019 s Rasputin :\nIndeed , Bannon \u2019 s \u201c understanding \u201d of the world is exactly what has people concerned . Bannon has become Trump \u2019 s most influential adviser and ( along with Stephen Miller , a former aide to attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions ) seems to be guiding Trump toward his goals , even if the president is clueless about the details or the ramifications . Bannon is a radical white nationalist whose main objective , as he has openly admitted , is to blow everything up \u2014 essentially to destroy the existing social and political order . What that leaves us with after the smoke clears is anyone \u2019 s guess , since he is notably vague on the endgame . \u2026 You can see this perfectly manifested in the first week \u2019 s orders on ( nonexistent ) voter fraud , immigration and deportation policies . The ban on Muslims from certain countries has particular national security implications , in that experts believe it will be a splendid propaganda tool for ISIS and will drive a wedge between the U.S. and many of its allies \u2014 something that fits perfectly with Bannon \u2019 s overall \u201c blow it up \u201d philosophy . That worldview is reflected in far right movements and parties in the U.K. ( the UK Independence Party ) , Germany ( the Alliance for Germany ) , the Netherlands ( the Party for Freedom ) and France ( the National Front ) , among others , and some of these movements have also been cultivated by the Russian president Vladimir Putin . ( There is evidence of his government \u2019 s attempts to meddle in European elections , in a similar fashion to what allegedly happened in the U.S. during the recent presidential campaign . ) This is the worldview that is likely to inform President Trump on policy . As Bannon said last summer , Trump is just a \u201c blunt instrument \u201d and at this point it doesn \u2019 t matter if he \u201c gets it \u201d or not . In his new role as Trump \u2019 s Rasputin , Bannon is now in a position to literally make his dreams of destruction come true .\nWe don \u2019 t have to go into similarities between the two men , starting with bad taste in clothes . Rasputin was an infamous womanizer and drunkard ; Bannon has been married and divorced three times , and let \u2019 s not even speculate about his interactions with women ( one ex-wife filed a charge of domestic violence , but it was dropped due to \u201c witness unavailability \u201d ) .\nThere is ample evidence of Bannon \u2019 s ties to , or at least sympathy with , Russia and Russian President Vladimir Putin , in whom many in the alt-right movement believe they have found an ally .
