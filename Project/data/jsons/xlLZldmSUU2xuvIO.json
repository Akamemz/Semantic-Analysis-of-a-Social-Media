As prosecutors and courts prepare for the new rules , Jed Painter , assistant district attorney for Nassau County ( on Long Island ) , has been giving presentations on how these new bail rules work .\nPainter has problems with these new bail rules and says so . Critics say he 's encouraging prosecutors in New York to look for ways to manipulate the new system in order to keep defendants behind bars with high cash bail demands .\nThe push to reduce or completely eliminate cash bail is one of several recent trends by criminal justice reformers attempting to cut back on the number of people unnecessarily locked behind bars . While bail had originally been intended as a way to make sure defendants show up for court dates , it has long become a thoughtless , bureaucratic machine that often simply orders defendants to pay money or stay stuck behind bars , sometimes for weeks or months , even though they have not been convicted . The end result has been that people 's pretrial detention status depended not on whether the defendant was deemed dangerous or a flight risk , but whether he or she had access to money or could pay a bail bondsman .\nCity & State New York listened to a podcast post of one of Painter 's presentations where he gave some `` suggestions '' on dealing with some defendants that had the whiff of trying to subvert the new guidelines to keep them behind bars :\nPainter gives what he called a `` practice pointer you can tell your police '' : If a defendant warranted on a felony does n't show up to court , `` do n't pick them up right away . Do n't be their Uber , '' he said . `` You 're not going to get bail on them for that violation . Wait the 30 days , and then you 've got your bail jumping charge waiting for them . '' \u2026 Later in the presentation , Painter gave a strategy for when you have a `` problem child '' \u2014presumably , an uncooperative defendant who wo n't show up to court dates .

Painter suggests asking the judge to require the defendant check in daily by phone or Skype . If they fail , then the defendant could be arrested\u2014ensuring their attendance in court . `` Can you do this by yourself ? No . Can you talk to your administrative judges about doing this ? Absolutely , '' Painter said .\nPainter responded to City & State and some critics from civil rights and criminal justice groups . He claims they 're misrepresenting his training .

Part of eliminating dependence on cash bail means having plans for when some defendants do n't show up for court . The good news is that other cities and states have reduced the use of cash bail significantly and are not seeing an increase in people missing court dates . Compliance remains very high . But under New York 's new pretrial system , as Painter explains , missing court dates , even repeatedly , does not on its own rise to the threshold for prosecutors to demand a defendant be remanded into custody .\nIn his first example , if a defendant does n't show up for court within 30 days when ordered to do so , that counts as a new felony crime that can get his or her freedom revoked . So if a defendant is deliberately uncooperative it 's a way of forcing the matter . This is not a mechanism for manipulating the system , unless a court is falling down on its job of informing defendants properly about court dates and locations .\nThe second example of requiring defendants to check in regularly is actually how New Jersey 's pretrial system successfully works , now that bail is rarely ever ordered .
