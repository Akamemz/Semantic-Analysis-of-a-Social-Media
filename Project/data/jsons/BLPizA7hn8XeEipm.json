    "content": "By the time Scott Walker dropped out of the 2016 presidential race Monday , few in the political world were surprised .\nThe Republican governor of Wisconsin was running out of money . His campaign staff was bloated and in disarray . He failed to impress in the debates . And GOP voters had abandoned him . By Sunday , he was a mere asterisk in the new CNN/ORC poll , coming in at less than one-half of 1 percent among Republicans .\nJust a few months ago , Governor Walker was the golden boy of the Republican field , widely seen as a top-tier prospect for the nomination and leading the polls in Iowa , the crucial first nominating state . He had won three elections for governor in four years , including a recall vote , after a hard-fought defeat of public sector unions . In January , a fiery speech at a conservative conference in Iowa wowed the GOP base .\nBut when Walker began the tough slog of trying to impress a wider audience , it wasn \u2019 t pretty .\nHis campaign holds a number of lessons for this campaign season \u2013 some old , some new . Being a governor did him little good , as was the case for Texas Gov . Rick Perry in 2012 . And a big money super political action committee could n't save his campaign , as was the case for Mr. Perry this year .\nHis departure makes the likely GOP showdown between outsiders and insiders sharper .
