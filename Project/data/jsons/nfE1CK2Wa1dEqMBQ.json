This is a line that took on a life of its own shortly after the tragedy happened on Sept. 11 , 2012 . It has been repeated ever since and it will continue to be repeated until the end of time precisely for the above reason : It can \u2019 t be disproven , so , knowing that evil Hillary , it must be true .\nThe GOP version is this : On Sept. 14 , 2012 , at Joint Base Andrews outside of Washington , Clinton and President Obama met with family members of the four men killed in the Benghazi attack . Clinton is said to have lied in this meeting because she blamed the infamous video Innocence of Muslims for the attack . It was later demonstrated that the video had little to do with the attack , although debate over what role , if any , it played continues to this day .\nOf course , the fact-checkers have looked into it , and they \u2019 ve found no evidence to support the claim that Clinton lied . Politifact recounted the whole \u201c controversy \u201d in great detail , and found that some family members say Clinton mentioned the video , while others ( Clinton included ) don \u2019 t remember it that way . But Politifact emphasizes that even if she did blame the video for the deaths , calling that a deliberate lie is unsupported by any chain of facts . A clearer picture came into focus the following day , Sept. 15 .\nThe Washington Post \u2019 s Glenn Kessler looked into it too , after Marco Rubio called Clinton a liar in a debate last fall . Kessler gave Rubio only two Pinocchios out of four because of the conflicting accounts of what was said in the meeting and the confusion at the time in intelligence circles about what was behind the attack , but Kessler concluded that Rubio \u201c does not have enough evidence to label Clinton a liar . \u201d\nObviously , the Kool-Aid caucus has a ready answer for this , which is that Politifact and The Washington Post are both in on the pro-Clinton conspiracy .
