The European Union has levied billions of dollars in fines against Google and Australia has moved to force the company to pay for news . But action in the U.S. , Google \u2019 s biggest market , has been elusive since enforcers closed an antitrust investigation seven years ago .\nThat \u2019 s about to change : The Justice Department , led by Attorney General William Barr , is preparing to file an antitrust lawsuit against the company , according to a person familiar with the matter . News Corp. representatives have met privately with the Justice Department about the investigation .\nLast week , a trade group for news organizations that is chaired by a senior News Corp. executive published a research paper outlining how Google has leveraged its dominance to take publishers \u2019 content and drive traffic without compensating them under copyright laws . The trade group , the News Media Alliance , sent the report to the Justice Department .\nWhen it comes to the power of America \u2019 s tech giants , President Donald Trump and Murdoch are on the same page . As News Corp. chases Google around the world with claims the company is abusing its dominance , Trump has repeatedly lashed out against the internet search giant and its tech peers , complaining last month that they are controlled by the \u201c Radical Left . \u201d\nWhile Trump recently criticized Murdoch \u2019 s Fox News for \u201c doing nothing \u201d to help him get elected in November , the network features some of the president \u2019 s most strident defenders , particularly in the face of his biggest crises like the coronavirus outbreak and the nationwide protests that gripped U.S. cities in the wake of George Floyd \u2019 s death in Minneapolis .\nNews Corp. , the Justice Department and Google all declined to comment about News Corp. \u2019 s campaign . Google has previously said that advertisers and publishers have a lot of choices for the advertising technology they use and that competition is \u201c flourishing . \u201d\nSince he took over the Justice Department in early 2019 , Barr has been Trump \u2019 s most reliable foot-soldier in the effort to corral Google and its big-tech rivals . He opened a broad inquiry into whether they are thwarting competition -- then took a hands-on role in shaping the investigation . Last fall , after the Justice Department had announced the investigation , Barr met with Murdoch in New York , according to the New York Times .\nThe attorney general tipped his hand at his January 2019 confirmation hearing when he said : \u201c I think a lot of people wonder how such huge behemoths that now exist in Silicon Valley have taken shape under the nose of the antitrust enforcers . \u201d\nWhen he learned in May 2019 that Makan Delrahim , his antitrust chief , had agreed to open inquiries into Google and Apple Inc. while handing over Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. to the Federal Trade Commission , Barr was miffed , according to a person familiar with the matter . Two months later , the Justice Department announced wide-ranging reviews of the top social media , retail and search platforms , effectively grabbing authority over all four tech giants and doing an end-run around the agreement with the FTC .\nBarr also assigned his No . 2 , Jeffrey Rosen , to oversee the probes . Rosen last fall brought on Ryan Shores , a seasoned antitrust litigator from Shearman & Sterling LLP , as a senior adviser in the tech company probes .\nBarr , who clashed with tech companies over open-internet rules as general counsel at Verizon Communications Inc. and its predecessor from 1994 to 2008 , advocates reining in the liability shield the tech companies enjoy for content on their platforms , a protection Trump is also trying to undermine . Last week , Barr proposed a broad reform to that immunity .\nA Justice Department lawsuit against Google could potentially do what Murdoch and other publishers have long sought : disrupt Google \u2019 s hold over the digital advertising market and the revenue that comes with it . While any case could take years to play out , it carries the risk of forcing Google to split off parts or all of its advertising business .\n\u201c Publishers , particularly quality publishers that invest in content , haven \u2019 t believed the digital advertising ecosystem works for them for a long time , \u201d said David Chavern , the president of the News Media Alliance , which represents news organizations , including News Corp. \u201c The whole system is designed so you can \u2019 t follow the money . All we know is we \u2019 re not getting enough of it . \u201d\nThe risk is high for Google . In the last major monopoly case brought by the U.S. -- the 1998 lawsuit the Bill Clinton administration pursued against Microsoft Corp. -- a judge initially ordered the breakup of the software company . That decision was overturned on appeal in 2001 and the George W. Bush administration settled the matter in 2002 , with Microsoft agreeing to court supervision for nine years .\nAt issue for publishers is that Google owns much of the technology that delivers ads across the web , acting as the intermediary between advertisers and web publishers and collecting fees along the way in what is sometimes called the \u201c ad tech tax . \u201d\nPublishers have little choice but to go through Google . Its technology acts as the gatekeeper to about 90 % of advertising space that websites sell using automated systems , according to a paper issued last month outlining how Google may be violating antitrust laws in the digital ad market . That figure excludes so-called walled gardens like Amazon and Facebook , which use their own ad technology .\n\u201c The publishers are trying to monetize their content and they only have one choice in how to do that , which is Google , \u201d said Yale University economist Fiona Scott Morton , one of the paper \u2019 s authors . Publishers also compete against Google \u2019 s YouTube to sell ad space . When a company depends on its direct competitor for revenue , \u201c that \u2019 s a problem , \u201d she said .\nThe coronavirus outbreak has raised the stakes for publishers , which have been battered by a drop in advertising revenue , leading to layoffs , furloughs and pay cuts across the industry .\nAmong publishers , News Corp. has been one of the most vocal about that lack of choice and the costs publishers incur as a result .

News Corp. has made several campaign donations to Republican state attorneys general who have been outspoken about Google , according to data compiled by the National Institute on Money in Politics , which tracks donations .\nNews Corp. \u2019 s political action committee donated $ 2,000 to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton less than two months before Paxton announced a multistate investigation into Google last year .
