I \u2019 m Amy Goodman , with Nermeen Shaikh .\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : An alarming new report by a panel of leading scientists warns that human activity is causing the disappearance and deterioration of wildlife at a rate that could represent an existential threat to humanity within our lifetimes . The United Nations \u2019 Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services released its conclusions earlier this week and found that 1 million species could go extinct in the foreseeable future unless current trends are reversed . The study estimates the global extinction rate is , quote , \u201c already at least tens to hundreds of times higher than it averaged over the past 10 million years . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s the largest and most comprehensive global study of biodiversity ever . It took three years to complete and is based on 15,000 scientific papers . The landmark report singled out industrial farming and fishing as major drivers of the crisis and called for transformative change to arrest present trends of biodiversity loss and species extinction . The report will be released in full later this year . This is chair of the U.N. panel , Sir Robert Watson .\nROBERT WATSON : We \u2019 re losing species at a historical rate . Potentially 500,000 to a million species are threatened with loss . We have lost much of our native forests , much of our native wetlands . And effectively , biodiversity needs to be considered as an equally important issue as climate change . It \u2019 s not just an environmental issue ; it is an economic issue , a development issue , a security issue , a social , moral and ethical issue .\nAMY GOODMAN : To talk more about the report , we \u2019 re joined by two guests . In Minneapolis , Kate Brauman is with us , one of the coordinating lead authors of the U.N. science report , environmental scientist at University of Minnesota . And here in New York , Ashley Dawson is joining us , professor of postcolonial studies at City University of New York Graduate Center and College of Staten Island . His books include Extinction : A Radical History .\nWe welcome you both to \u2588\u2588\u2588 ! Kate Brauman , you \u2019 re one of the lead authors on this report . A million species going extinct ? Explain .\nKATE BRAUMAN : It is really shocking . What we \u2019 ve done is that a bunch of experts have looked at really what the trends look like for many , many different species , including insects . And looking at those trends , it \u2019 s quite clear that up to a million species , 25 % of all of the animals on Earth , are threatened with extinction , many within the next couple of decades , unless we change our activities .\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : And what most surprised you , Kate , about this report as you were working on the research ?\nKATE BRAUMAN : The thing to me that \u2019 s the most shocking is really just what the picture looks like when we bring it all together . So , this report is an assessment . It \u2019 s designed to bring together the incredibly large existing body of research . This was not designed to do new research . And so , much of this has been known . What we \u2019 ve done is really bring together all the pieces and lay them out clearly , so that we can see what a big problem this is .\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about the threat to biodiversity , ongoing species extinction and climate change ?\nKATE BRAUMAN : What we see is that there are a lot of different drivers that are causing this to happen and that they all interact with each other . So , probably the biggest threat to species to date has been land use change . We have made so many changes on the Earth , particularly through farming , but also through roads , through timber harvest , and that \u2019 s had a tremendous impact . But it interacts with climate change , and so what we see is that these interacting effects of land use change , climate , pollution , species extraction , that they all work together to really make huge threats to the environment and to us as humans .\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Well , I want to bring Ashley Dawson into the conversation . Ashley , you have written an entire book on the radical history of extinction . Your response to this report ?\nASHLEY DAWSON : Well , the report , I think , is really a landmark report . And it shows that the crisis we face isn \u2019 t just one of climate change . In some ways it \u2019 s comparable to the IPCC report from last October , which really sounded a really important alarm about the system that we face and its potential collapse . But what this shows is it \u2019 s a crisis of multiple different dimensions and that it \u2019 s driven by an economic system which is fundamentally destroying the terrestrial systems that we all depend on .\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Well , I \u2019 d like to turn to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo \u2019 s recent comments on the Arctic . Just hours after the release of the U.N. report , Pompeo celebrated the shrinking levels of sea ice in the region , saying it opened up new opportunities for trade . He also called for the exploitation of natural resources in the Arctic .\nSECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO : The Arctic is at the forefront of opportunity and abundance . It houses 13 % of the world \u2019 s undiscovered oil , 30 % of its undiscovered gas and an abundance of uranium , rare earth minerals , gold , diamonds and millions of square miles of untapped resources . Fisheries galore . \u2026 Steady reductions in sea ice are opening new passageways and new opportunities for trade . \u2026 Arctic sea lanes could come before the\u2014could become the 21st century Suez and Panama Canals . \u201d\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : So scientists warn that melting sea ice in the Arctic due to climate change will have catastrophic effects on coastal cities , biodiversity and the global economy . President Trump , of course , has called climate change a Chinese hoax . So , Ashley , your response to what Pompeo said just hours after this U.N. report was released ?\nASHLEY DAWSON : I think it typifies a kind of extractivist attitude , which , as I said , is destroying the planet . I mean , to give one concrete instance , we have been exploiting land so much and degrading land that we only have about 60 harvests left . Right ? Sixty agricultural harvests left .\nASHLEY DAWSON : It means about only 60 more years of food , potentially . So , we \u2019 re not only talking about a kind of crash of biodiversity and potential extinction for a lot of species out there ; we \u2019 re talking about a kind of fundamental crisis of humanity , its relationship to the natural world and our relations to one another .\nAMY GOODMAN : And he \u2019 s saying , if the ice melts , it opens up possibilities for trade . It means you can get another Panama or Suez Canal .\nASHLEY DAWSON : Yeah , it gives new meaning to Naomi Klein \u2019 s term \u201c disaster capitalism. \u201d Right ? I mean , this is really about yoking the planet as we push it towards unsustainability .\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to get your response to this , as well , Kate Brauman , that if the sea ice melts , it just opens up opportunities for trade .\nKATE BRAUMAN : Well , I will say that I see it as an opportunity , but as an opportunity for doing things better . One of the things we talk about a lot in this report is that we are not hopeless , that there are a lot of potential ways that we can have a better future . And one of those is really having better intergovernmental cooperation . The Arctic is a place where intergovernmental cooperation has happened in the past . And we have the opportunity to really manage and steward these resources in a positive way that can be a model for the way we think about the planet . Part of that is going to be really integrating what we know from indigenous and local cultures , many of whom have lived in these regions for a long time , into the way that we do management .\nAMY GOODMAN : Ashley Dawson , you talk about radical conservation . What does that look like ? And you particularly talk about cities . I am intrigued by the title of your book , Extreme Cities : The Peril and Promise of Urban Life in the Age of Climate Change .\nASHLEY DAWSON : Right . Well , so , right now we have a system of agribusiness that \u2019 s based on using fossil fuels for pesticides , fertilizers , and exploiting the land as much as possible . And we clearly need to shift . And one of the things that \u2019 s really wonderful about this report is that it explicitly talks about shifting that system to one that \u2019 s based on agroecology , using natural inputs , not using all of these pesticides that are destroying pollinators like bee populations and other insects .\nAnd we don \u2019 t just need to think about that happening outside cities , right ? Now the majority of humanity lives in cities . And so cities can also be a place for rewilding , for increasing some of the wetlands , for instance , that we have plowed under , and , by doing that , for absorbing more carbon . So I agree with Kate about how this report is sounding an alarm , but it \u2019 s also calling for really important shifts in attitude and material changes that can put us on a different course .\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : What does that say , Ashley , about the kind of structural transformations that would be required minimally for the economic system that governs at this point large parts of the planet , which is based on endless expansion and consumption by larger and larger numbers of people at greater levels ?\nASHLEY DAWSON : Yeah . I think it \u2019 s the greater levels that \u2019 s really key . I mean , the report does talk about the issue of population increase , but it also makes it quite clear that it \u2019 s inequality and a kind of capitalist system that \u2019 s based on constantly ramping up consumption of natural resources that is at fault , and that we need to shift away from that system .\nASHLEY DAWSON : What is the alternative ? The alternative is a kind of Green New Deal for the planet . And the authors of the system talk about that . They say quite explicitly that we need a values shift and a material shift towards more sustainable forms of engagement with the planet .\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : And , Kate , this report comes on the heels of several other climate reports , biodiversity reports . What is it that this report says that these other reports have not concluded ?\nKATE BRAUMAN : This report does a couple of different things . It brings together a wider body of evidence and really makes a point of elevating what we know from indigenous and local cultures . It makes a really explicit tie from human activities to biodiversity to human well-being . And then it points us in positive directions for the future . I think Ashley really summed this up right : We are identifying the need to really have transformational change , to redefine what it means to live well in a way that reduces our consumption and changes our production .\nAMY GOODMAN : Let me ask you , Ashley Dawson , about the anthropocentric nature of the report as it frames species \u2019 survival as a matter of human survival , perhaps concerned that humans won \u2019 t care that a million species will go extinct unless it \u2019 s put in terms of human beings going extinct .\nASHLEY DAWSON : Right , right . Well , you know , there is something about the report that is influenced by the times we live in . It \u2019 s called a report not just on biodiversity , but ecosystem services . And so that kind of neoliberal calculus is very evident from the report \u2019 s title itself . But I think that the report is sounding these alarm bells and not discounting the innate validity and importance of the natural world and of other life forms . It just wants to emphasize how intertwined we all are at this point\u2014right ? \u2014and how we can \u2019 t break that link .\nAMY GOODMAN : And , Kate Brauman , if you \u2019 d like to respond to that ?\nKATE BRAUMAN : I agree . It is an anthropocentric take . And that , I think , is very important , because , as Ashley says , we are not separate or unlinked from the environment . And stewarding the environment , whether we \u2019 re doing it for personal gain or because we care , is what we as humans are doing . And that brings us to the center in ways that I think are very important in terms of moving forward and changing our behavior and changing this trajectory .\nKATE BRAUMAN : I think so . One of the things that \u2019 s so exciting about this is that it is a report of the governments . There are 132 member states who are part of his platform , and they approved this document . This is something that governments say \u201c we think is important . \u201d\nAMY GOODMAN : We want to thank you both for being with us . Of course , we \u2019 re going to link to the report . Kate Brauman is one of the coordinating lead authors of the new U.N. report on extinction , environmental scientist at the University of Minnesota , speaking to us from Minneapolis . And Ashley Dawson is a professor at the CUNY Graduate Center . His books include Extinction : A Radical History , as well as Extreme Cities : The Peril and Promise of Urban Life in the Age of Climate Change .\nThat does it for our show . \u2588\u2588\u2588 ! is currently accepting applications for paid 6-month internships here in our New York City studio .
