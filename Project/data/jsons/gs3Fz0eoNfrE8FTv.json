    "content": "Facebook CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday defended the social network 's decision not to send speech from politicians to third-party fact-checkers , a move that 's drawn scrutiny , especially from Democrats in the US .\n`` I do n't think most people want to live in a world where you can only post things that tech companies judge to be 100 % true , '' Zuckerberg said during a nearly 40-minute speech at Georgetown University .\nThe remarks highlight the social network 's controversial approach to political speech as it tries to strike a balance between free speech and combating misinformation during elections . They could also escalate tensions between Facebook and politicians as the 2020 campaign season heats up . Democrats and civil rights groups swiftly criticized Zuckerberg 's speech , arguing that the company has n't learned from its past mistakes .\nZuckerberg said providing people a voice and including everyone are central to everything he creates , comments that come as he fends off criticism that his company wields too much power over social and political discourse . He championed the role of technology platforms , saying they had `` decentralized '' power .\n`` People no longer have to rely on traditional gatekeepers , '' Zuckerberg said . `` I actually believe that the much bigger story is how much these platforms have decentralized power by putting it directly into people 's hands . ''\nHe also pushed back against the idea of banning political ads , arguing that this would favor incumbents and whoever the media chooses to cover . But it 's an idea the company has considered , Zuckerberg said .\nFacebook has faced mounting pressure to do more to combat misinformation , hate speech and other offensive content on the world 's largest social network , which has 2.5 billion users . The company also faces allegations that it censors conservative speech . Facebook has repeatedly denied that charge .\nI do n't think most people want to live in a world where you can only post things that tech companies judge to be 100 percent true . Mark Zuckerberg\nOver the last month , the company 's hands-off approach to political speech has sparked more outrage . In particular , Democrats have lambasted a policy that allows politicians to post false information in ads on the social network .\nEarlier this month , Facebook rejected a request from Joe Biden 's presidential campaign to pull down an ad from President Donald Trump 's re-election campaign that contained misinformation about the former vice president . In response , presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren , a US Democratic senator from Massachusetts , ran an ad containing the deliberately false claim that Zuckerberg endorsed Trump . She did it to prove a point about the social network 's policy , and the ad noted that it included misinformation .\nZuckerberg said Facebook 's policy is n't designed to benefit politicians but `` because we think people should be able to see for themselves what politicians are saying . '' In a Q & A after the speech , Zuckerberg said he does n't think that allowing politicians to lie in ads is `` pro-conservative . ''\nBill Russo , a spokesman for Biden 's presidential campaign , said in a statement that Facebook is allowing politicians to target Americans with `` disproven lies and conspiracy theories . ''\n`` Zuckerberg attempted to use the Constitution as a shield for his company 's bottom line , and his choice to cloak Facebook 's policy in a feigned concern for free expression demonstrates how unprepared his company is for this unique moment in our history and how little it has learned over the past few years , '' Russo said .\nCivil rights group Color of Change said Zuckerberg is `` doubling down on a business model '' that harms democracy .\n`` Under the guise of protecting voice and free expression , Facebook , as in prior elections , is giving Trump and the right-wing a free pass to spread lies , hate and misinformation on the platform , '' Color of Change President Rashad Robinson said in a statement .\nZuckerberg has been talking to conservatives about their concerns regarding bias . He 's had a quiet series of dinners with aggrieved conservatives to hear their complaints . In September , he also visited Trump and lawmakers from both parties during a rare visit to Washington , DC . On Friday , Zuckerberg is scheduled to appear on Fox News for the first time .\nBut with the 2020 US presidential election just around the corner , lawmakers are more worried about the spread of misinformation on social media . One big concern : `` deepfake '' videos that use AI to make it appear like a person is uttering words they are n't .\n`` I think figuring out which types of deepfakes are actually a threat today , versus are a theoretical future threat once the technology advances , is one of the things that we need to make sure we get right , '' Zuckerberg said in an interview with The Washington Post .\nEarlier this year , Facebook faced criticism for keeping up a manipulated video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that made the Democrat seem like she was slurring her words . Facebook does n't ban misinformation but will show it lower in users ' news feeds if fact-checkers rate the information as false .\nZuckerberg 's speech touched on a wide range of topics , including calls to break up Facebook and the company 's previous efforts to enter China . Zuckerberg reiterated Facebook 's position that breaking off Instagram and WhatsApp from the company would n't solve woes around privacy and other issues . He said the social network could n't strike an agreement with China , but the silver lining is that the company has more freedom to fight for free expression .\nDuring the speech , Zuckerberg referenced the Rev . Martin Luther King Jr. , the Vietnam War and movements such as # BlackLivesMatter and # MeToo . That did n't sit well with some civil rights activists .\nKing 's daughter , the Rev . Bernice King , said in a tweet that she wants Facebook to better understand the challenges her father faced from political disinformation campaigns .\n`` These campaigns created an atmosphere for his assassination , '' she tweeted .\nI heard # MarkZuckerberg 's \u2018 free expression \u2019 speech , in which he referenced my father . I 'd like to help Facebook better understand the challenges # MLK faced from disinformation campaigns launched by politicians .
