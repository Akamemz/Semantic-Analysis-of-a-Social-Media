That was the billboard-size headline from Wall Street trading desks after the U.S. job-creation machine hit the wall in May. The government said 38,000 jobs were created in May, way, way, way below the roughly 160,000 new positions Wall Street economists had been expecting.\n\nIt was the worst month for job creation since September 2010.\n\nThe Janet Yellen-led Federal Reserve had been driving home the message that it was \"appropriate\" to hike interest rates in coming months \u2013 and perhaps as early as June \u2013 IF the job market and economy continued to perform well and meet their more upbeat forecast.\n\nBut the May jobs report was bad. Really bad.\n\n\"Horrible,\" is the word used by Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at MSUSA. \"Very weak,\" chimed in Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at EverBank. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, tweeted out that the lousy jobs number amounted to a \"bombshell.\"\n\nA bombshell, indeed. So weak was the 38,000 May job count, that Wall Street now sees virtually a zero chance of the Fed moving at its June meeting, which breaks up on June 15.\n\n\"This is the weakest number of workers added in almost six years,\" Gaffney told USA TODAY via e-mail.\n\nAfter the dreadful jobs report was released, the odds of a June hike plunged to about 4%, down sharply from 19% before the data were released, according to futures markets tracked by the CME Group.\n\n\"Just when they thought it was safe to go back into the water,\" the Fed gets hit with this less-than-stellar data point on jobs, Ricchiuto told clients in a report. \"This now assures that June is off the table, but may not rule out July.\"\n\nBut professional investors are still not willing to rule out a hike in July \u2013 at least not yet as there is a lot of economic data to come between now and July.
