Conversely , did the press go too far in abandoning its traditional even-handedness and unrestrainedly attacking Trump , as rightwing pundits are now suggesting ? Looking forward , what will be the role of the established media as we head into the chilly waters of a choppy new era ?\nThose are just some of the glaring questions left hanging at the end of an epically weird election season . To begin poking some of those issues , \u2588\u2588\u2588 has teamed up with the Columbia Journalism Review ( CJR ) , a leading source of media criticism .\nIt has compiled a unique oral history of the 2016 election through the eyes of 40 of the top TV and press editors , reporters and columnists who helped shape and define the public perception of this year \u2019 s race . The narrative runs to 11,000 words , with \u2588\u2588\u2588 publishing an edited version of it .\nOne of the first big questions that CJR \u2019 s oral history , in tandem with \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s own exploration of the subject , throws up is the role of blanket TV coverage in the rise , fall and rise again of President-elect Trump . Ben Smith , editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed , was quick to spot earlier this year that Trump \u2019 s Twitter feed acted not only as a powerful megaphone channeling his voice directly to his followers ( he had 13m of them on Twitter on election day , as well as 12m on Facebook ) , it also served as a news script for the cable channels . Trump would tweet out his latest offensive or aggressive tweet , often in the early hours of the morning , and TV news editors arriving at their desks would pick it up and turn it into ratings-friendly headlines that would then go on to dominate the rest of the 24-hour news cycle .\n\u201c What typically drives TV is great reporting by newspapers . Instead , Trump used his tweets as an alternative route to great journalism , and that turned out to have been a very big deal , \u201d Smith told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nThe TV channels feasted on tweeted Trumpisms with an alacrity that many observers found disturbing . According to a study by mediaQuant , Trump benefited from the equivalent of $ 5.2bn worth of free airtime from earned media , a quantity that the firm \u2019 s analysts said was \u201c almost surreal in sheer magnitude \u201d . In return , cable channels enjoyed a massive ratings spike .\nTV was convulsed by other controversies , notably CNN \u2019 s decision to employ Trump \u2019 s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski while he was still receiving \u201c severance payments \u201d from his old boss , and the embarrassment ( also falling to CNN ) of Democratic strategist Donna Brazile leaking questions from a town hall event in advance to the Clinton campaign . More red faces erupted at NBC when its Access Hollywood tape of Trump \u2019 s lewd comments about women was leaked to the Washington Post after the network appeared to dither over broadcasting it .\nBut these difficulties , humiliating at times though they were , pale in comparison with the overarching charge that TV \u2013 and to a lesser degree the press \u2013 was indiscriminate for far too long in its handling of Trump , engaging with him more like the Apprentice reality TV star that he was than the US president that he wanted to become . \u201c During the primaries , cable news \u2013 in particular CNN and Fox , and to some extent MSNBC \u2013 gave Trump unhealthily generous , inflated coverage . That helped make him , \u201d says Margaret Sullivan , media columnist of the Washington Post .\nIt takes someone with the on-the-ground experience of John Weaver , chief strategist to Trump \u2019 s rival John Kasich during the Republican primaries , to spell out the full impact of this media binge on the election . He believes it actively distorted the process , and even now , six months after Kasich dropped out of the race , you can still hear the fury in Weaver \u2019 s voice .\n\u201c I hope there \u2019 s some deep introspection at the networks and cable channels over the billions of dollars of free coverage they gave to Donald Trump , often without holding him accountable for his bizarre claims . He is judged by such a low standard by many of the news media , it \u2019 s troubling to me . \u201d\nThe sense that the media allowed itself to be taken for a ride by the Trump campaign in exchange for stellar ratings came to a crunch on 16 September in Washington DC . By now enshrined as Republican nominee , Trump lured the pack of political reporters to a press conference by promising to make a statement \u2013 an apology , it was assumed \u2013 about his long-held and oft-repeated \u201c birther \u201d lie about President Obama having been born outside the US .\nThe location for the event happened to be the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue that Trump had just renovated into a luxury hotel . For 26 minutes he subjected the media , and through them the American people , to a succession of unctuous speeches by retired military leaders singing the candidate \u2019 s praises . Then , when Trump finally got round to issuing a 21-word rebuttal of his own false birther theory , he prefaced it with yet another lie that Hillary Clinton was responsible for having started the toxic rumor in the first place .\nIt was vintage Trump . Almost a half-hour of free advertising \u2013 not only for his presidential campaign but also for his new hotel \u2013 handed to him on a plate by the cable networks in exchange for a 30-second non-apology that made false accusations against his opponent . Nothing new there , then .\nWhat was new was the response of the assembled media crowd who had been forced to sit through the ordeal , cameras rolling , keyboards rattling , as though they were so many of Trump \u2019 s dutiful playthings . It was a \u201c political Rick-roll \u201d fumed CNN \u2019 s Jake Tapper , referring to the Rick Astley internet meme , while John King on the same channel lamented : \u201c We got played again . \u201d\nJay Rosen , who teaches journalism at New York University and whose blog PressThink.org has been a widely cited resource on the fraught relationship between Trump and the press in 2016 , sees the DC hotel debacle as a seminal moment . \u201c That \u2019 s when people in the campaign press corp got disgusted not just with Trump \u2019 s mendacity and manipulation but at themselves for playing along with it . That turned the worm . \u201d\n\u201c It was an important turning point , \u201d agrees Kyle Pope , CJR \u2019 s editor and publisher . \u201c It \u2019 s when reporters said , \u2018 No more , that \u2019 s it , enough \u2019 . \u201d\nThe response from the New York Times was decisive and swift . As its political editor Carolyn Ryan related to a recent CJR roundtable of media executives , she immediately approached the paper \u2019 s executive editor .\n\u201c I went to Dean Baquet and I said , \u2018 Can we call this the unwinding of a lie ? \u2019 He understood the potency of coming out very directly and saying that , and that what Trump had done \u2013 a willful deceit \u2013 was far more egregious than some of the fabrications and stretching of the truth that we usually see in politics . So he was firmly behind us . \u201d\nThe resulting piece by Michael Barbaro marked in itself a seminal moment for the Times newsroom , which as Ryan pointed out is a \u201c fairly traditional institution \u201d that until recently struggled with the idea of calling a lie a lie . Yet in this case the editorial decision to do just that \u2013 abandoning any attachment to the \u201c on the one hand this , but on the other hand that \u201d school of journalism \u2013 came quickly and easily . \u201c We decided in about 40 minutes , \u201d Ryan said .\nThere has been a lot of discussion this election cycle about how Trump \u2019 s insurgent campaign , its asymmetry as Rosen has put it , has shaken up many of the time-honored rituals and false equivalencies of political journalism . Adam Moss , New York magazine \u2019 s editor-in-chief , makes clear that his magazine consciously decided to ditch the journalistic habits of a lifetime : \u201c We don \u2019 t pretend to objectivity , but we do , as a rule over the years , try to maintain some kind of even-handedness . We abandoned that because we felt the threat of his candidacy and presidency was too great . \u201d\nThe counterpoint to that is that several of the contributors to the CJR oral history express regret that , at least at the outset , the coverage of real estate businessman was \u201c seriously flawed \u201d , as Jorge Ramos puts it . The billionaire was underestimated as a candidate , and as a result treated initially as a bit of a joke . Laura McGann , a politics editor for Vox , bravely admits feeling guilty that she assigned a deep dive into Trump soon after he launched his campaign in June 2015 to a ( very good ) intern , adding : \u201c I regret not taking him more seriously a year ago than I did . \u201d\nBut BuzzFeed \u2019 s Ben Smith makes the point that , important though such post-election soul-searching is , it should not obscure the fact that there was plenty of hard-hitting reporting done even early on . \u201c The Washingon Post , New York Times , we at BuzzFeed , Politico , \u2588\u2588\u2588 and many more , gave a thoroughly detailed account of him . Anyone who was surprised by the person who emerged during the campaign really wasn \u2019 t paying attention . \u201d\nYou only have to credit a tiny portion of the highlights of the coverage this cycle to see how impressive much of it was : Mckay Coppins \u2019 seminal romp with Trump all the way back in 2014 ; Susanne Craig \u2019 s heaven-sent package in her Times mailbox containing the billionaire \u2019 s leaked tax returns ; David Fahrenthold of the Post \u2019 s work on the Trump Foundation and his groping scoop ; Ari Berman of the Nation \u2019 s probe into the real rigging of the election ; Guardian columnist Lucia Graves \u2019 interviews with women alleging the candidate sexually assaulted them .\nSo what happened to all this solid work ? Why did it appear to go up in a puff of smoke on election night ? There is a separate and febrile debate over whether or not opinion polls were in part to blame for giving the impression that the White House was in the bag for Clinton , but many other theories are circulating .\nOne prevalent idea , as Hadas Gold of Politico tells CJR , is that the media did its job but the public \u201c just did not care \u201d . The New York Times political reporter Jonathan Martin offers an opposite conclusion : that the coverage did hit home with voters , as reflected in Trump \u2019 s historically bad popularity ratings . To which it might be added that Hillary Clinton is still winning in the popular vote .\nA third line of inquiry that is likely to run and run is whether the media , in its coastal bubble , failed to get to grips with the anger that was brewing right under its nose in the American heartlands . A flick of that argument was given in the missive sent by Arthur Sulzberger and Baquet , publisher and executive editor of the New York Times , to their readers soon after the election . \u201c Did Donald Trump \u2019 s sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters ? \u201d\nAnswering his own question , Baquet told \u2588\u2588\u2588 US that the Times did in fact write extensively about anger in America in the run-up to the election , but adds that it \u2019 s a good idea as an editor to be humble enough to ask oneself what questions should have been asked during the campaign .\n\u201c Nobody , including the Trump campaign itself , quite understood the forces that would lead to Donald Trump being elected in what everybody agrees was a surprise . A big part of my job now is to explain that in the coming months , to go out in the country , talk to people who feel anxious about the future of the country , don \u2019 t caricature them , let them speak . Just let them talk . \u201d\nA more disturbing thought is that while many news outlets took great efforts to chronicle the plight of the white working classes in middle America , their dispatches didn \u2019 t register with millions of voters for the simple reason that those voters weren \u2019 t reading any of us . Amid the ongoing muscle of Drudge , the new transcendence of Breitbart , not to mention the proliferation of fake news sites , conservative Americans \u2013 and for that matter liberals \u2013 are increasingly able to receive information from within their own alternative bubble where their opinions are reinforced without being challenged by the loathed MSM .\nOne of the more despairing expressions of this theory was given by New York magazine \u2019 s Adam Moss to CJR : \u201c The media as it used to be thought of is just not that important any more . It doesn \u2019 t matter that some people were doing good work because \u2026 we \u2019 re just talking to ourselves and people who already agree with us . \u201d\nSince Trump \u2019 s victory , another theory has been aired increasingly by right-of-center pundits such as Howard Kurtz of Fox News that flips the argument that the media did too little too late to expose Trump on its head . In this iteration , major outlets did too much , were too eager to go after him . The editor of the Wall Street Journal , Gerard Baker , tells CJR that \u201c some reporters saw it as their role to stop this man from becoming president , they put themselves in the role of partisans \u201d .\nIt fell to Piers Morgan of Mail Online , as it often does , to put the case most stridently : \u201c The NYT \u2019 s ludicrously biased anti-Trump barrage of bile helped him get elected . \u201d\n\u201c That \u2019 s ridiculous , \u201d ripostes the Times \u2019 Dean Baquet . \u201c We didn \u2019 t cover Donald Trump any more aggressively than we covered Hillary Clinton . People forget that we broke the story of Clinton \u2019 s emails . If both sides think you were tough on them , maybe that means you were fair . \u201d\nOf all the mainstream media bashing that has been unleashed since 8 November , one source of it stands head and shoulders above the rest : Donald Trump himself . Which is not surprising , given his track record during the campaign .\nReporters deemed to be producing unfavourable copy were punished by Trump : Jorge Ramos was ejected from a press conference after the Univision anchor dared to ask an awkward question ; Coppins was turned away from Trump rallies as comeuppance for his caustic 2014 profile ; a lengthening list of other media outlets were banned by the campaign ; individual journalists were targeted for bullying , such as NBC News \u2019 s Katy Tur ; supporters at campaign stops were enabled to turn in anger against camera operators just doing their jobs , screaming : \u201c CNN sucks ! CNN sucks ! CNN sucks ! \u201d\nSince Trump \u2019 s metamorphosis into president-elect , the tendency to target the media has only got worse . Now he routinely gives the press pool the slip , showing contempt for both transparency and tradition . Back on his Android phone , Trump is on the \u201c failing \u201d New York Times warpath , displaying a sort of frenzied disdain that hardly bodes well for the relationship between soon-to-be president and the country \u2019 s paper of record .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve never seen anything quite like this , \u201d says Baquet , who as former editor of the Los Angeles Times and Washington bureau chief of the Times has seen more than most . \u201c I don \u2019 t think we \u2019 ve ever had a president-elect tweeting about us , that \u2019 s for sure . \u201d\nAs 20 January 2017 and the start of his presidency bears down upon us , much of the media will enter the Trump era carrying with them a profound sense of trepidation . \u201c This is a moment of high danger for the press ; we \u2019 re heading into a dark period for American democracy and American journalism , \u201d says Jay Rosen of NYU . Jorge Ramos tells CJR : \u201c I think we \u2019 ll remember this election as unique and very concerning for the future of the press because if this becomes the norm , we are in serious trouble . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s not just the lack of access , mocking and bullying that can be expected from President Trump . There \u2019 s also the internal danger that the media will normalize his time in office under the cloak of traditional reverence for the presidency .\nContributors to the CJR \u2019 s account of 2016 point out that a pattern of normalization was established even on the campaign trail , when media outlets appeared to be willing Trump on to elevate himself from his startlingly unconventional approach to a proper \u201c presidential \u201d mode . In the memorable description of Tommy Craggs , Slate \u2019 s politics editor , the candidate \u201c could have gone up there and danced the hoochie coochie and they would have said , \u2018 This is a welcome change in tone from Donald Trump \u2019 \u201d .\nSince the election that trend has thickened , some believe . John Weaver , the former chief strategist for Trump \u2019 s Republican rival John Kasich , says he is outraged by media references to Steve Bannon , the Breitbart chairman who Trump has appointed his senior counselor in the White House , as a \u201c controversial figure \u201d or an \u201c aggressive conservative \u201d . \u201c No , no , that \u2019 s sugar-coating . He was the publisher of the news site that he said was home to the alt-right , and that is code for racism and sexism and fascism , \u201d Weaver said .\nSo what will be the role of the \u201c mainstream media \u201d as it embarks , somewhat battered but still standing , into Trump \u2019 s America ? Will it be to document the new administration with a detached and \u201c objective \u201d eye , as traditional newsroom canons dictate , or will it pursue that other burning function of the fourth estate , holding power to account ?\n\u201c We will cover him fairly and aggressively , and we will not let his criticism of us sway us or keep us from doing what we have to do , \u201d says Dean Baquet of the New York Times . \u201c In my mind our mission is clearer than it \u2019 s ever been : we have to cover the giant story of this extraordinary White House , which is going to change American politics and policy for years to come , as aggressively , truthfully and honestly as we can . \u201d",

More red faces erupted at NBC when its Access Hollywood tape of Trump\u2019s lewd comments about women was leaked to the Washington Post after the network appeared to dither over broadcasting it.\n\nBut these difficulties, humiliating at times though they were, pale in comparison with the overarching charge that TV \u2013 and to a lesser degree the press \u2013 was indiscriminate for far too long in its handling of Trump, engaging with him more like the Apprentice reality TV star that he was than the US president that he wanted to become. \u201cDuring the primaries, cable news \u2013 in particular CNN and Fox, and to some extent MSNBC \u2013 gave Trump unhealthily generous, inflated coverage. That helped make him,\u201d says Margaret Sullivan, media columnist of the Washington Post.\n\nIt takes someone with the on-the-ground experience of John Weaver, chief strategist to Trump\u2019s rival John Kasich during the Republican primaries, to spell out the full impact of this media binge on the election. He believes it actively distorted the process, and even now, six months after Kasich dropped out of the race, you can still hear the fury in Weaver\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cI hope there\u2019s some deep introspection at the networks and cable channels over the billions of dollars of free coverage they gave to Donald Trump, often without holding him accountable for his bizarre claims. He is judged by such a low standard by many of the news media, it\u2019s troubling to me.\u201d\n\nThe sense that the media allowed itself to be taken for a ride by the Trump campaign in exchange for stellar ratings came to a crunch on 16 September in Washington DC. By now enshrined as Republican nominee, Trump lured the pack of political reporters to a press conference by promising to make a statement \u2013 an apology, it was assumed \u2013 about his long-held and oft-repeated \u201cbirther\u201d lie about President Obama having been born outside the US.\n\nThe location for the event happened to be the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue that Trump had just renovated into a luxury hotel. For 26 minutes he subjected the media, and through them the American people, to a succession of unctuous speeches by retired military leaders singing the candidate\u2019s praises. Then, when Trump finally got round to issuing a 21-word rebuttal of his own false birther theory, he prefaced it with yet another lie that Hillary Clinton was responsible for having started the toxic rumor in the first place.\n\nIt was vintage Trump. Almost a half-hour of free advertising \u2013 not only for his presidential campaign but also for his new hotel \u2013 handed to him on a plate by the cable networks in exchange for a 30-second non-apology that made false accusations against his opponent. Nothing new there, then.\n\nWhat was new was the response of the assembled media crowd who had been forced to sit through the ordeal, cameras rolling, keyboards rattling, as though they were so many of Trump\u2019s dutiful playthings. It was a \u201cpolitical Rick-roll\u201d fumed CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, referring to the Rick Astley internet meme, while John King on the same channel lamented: \u201cWe got played again.\u201d\n\nJay Rosen, who teaches journalism at New York University and whose blog PressThink.org has been a widely cited resource on the fraught relationship between Trump and the press in 2016, sees the DC hotel debacle as a seminal moment. \u201cThat\u2019s when people in the campaign press corp got disgusted not just with Trump\u2019s mendacity and manipulation but at themselves for playing along with it. That turned the worm.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was an important turning point,\u201d agrees Kyle Pope, CJR\u2019s editor and publisher. \u201cIt\u2019s when reporters said, \u2018No more, that\u2019s it, enough\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe response from the New York Times was decisive and swift. As its political editor Carolyn Ryan related to a recent CJR roundtable of media executives, she immediately approached the paper\u2019s executive editor.\n\n\u201cI went to Dean Baquet and I said, \u2018Can we call this the unwinding of a lie?\u2019 He understood the potency of coming out very directly and saying that, and that what Trump had done \u2013 a willful deceit \u2013 was far more egregious than some of the fabrications and stretching of the truth that we usually see in politics. So he was firmly behind us.\u201d\n\nThe resulting piece by Michael Barbaro marked in itself a seminal moment for the Times newsroom, which as Ryan pointed out is a \u201cfairly traditional institution\u201d that until recently struggled with the idea of calling a lie a lie. Yet in this case the editorial decision to do just that \u2013 abandoning any attachment to the \u201con the one hand this, but on the other hand that\u201d school of journalism \u2013 came quickly and easily. \u201cWe decided in about 40 minutes,\u201d Ryan said.\n\nThere has been a lot of discussion this election cycle about how Trump\u2019s insurgent campaign, its asymmetry as Rosen has put it, has shaken up many of the time-honored rituals and false equivalencies of political journalism. Adam Moss, New York magazine\u2019s editor-in-chief, makes clear that his magazine consciously decided to ditch the journalistic habits of a lifetime: \u201cWe don\u2019t pretend to objectivity, but we do, as a rule over the years, try to maintain some kind of even-handedness. We abandoned that because we felt the threat of his candidacy and presidency was too great.\u201d\n\nThe counterpoint to that is that several of the contributors to the CJR oral history express regret that, at least at the outset, the coverage of real estate businessman was \u201cseriously flawed\u201d, as Jorge Ramos puts it. The billionaire was underestimated as a candidate, and as a result treated initially as a bit of a joke. Laura McGann, a politics editor for Vox, bravely admits feeling guilty that she assigned a deep dive into Trump soon after he launched his campaign in June 2015 to a (very good) intern, adding: \u201cI regret not taking him more seriously a year ago than I did.\u201d\n\nBut BuzzFeed\u2019s Ben Smith makes the point that, important though such post-election soul-searching is, it should not obscure the fact that there was plenty of hard-hitting reporting done even early on. \u201cThe Washingon Post, New York Times, we at BuzzFeed, Politico, the Guardian and many more, gave a thoroughly detailed account of him. Anyone who was surprised by the person who emerged during the campaign really wasn\u2019t paying attention.\u201d\n\nYou only have to credit a tiny portion of the highlights of the coverage this cycle to see how impressive much of it was: Mckay Coppins\u2019 seminal romp with Trump all the way back in 2014; Susanne Craig\u2019s heaven-sent package in her Times mailbox containing the billionaire\u2019s leaked tax returns; David Fahrenthold of the Post\u2019s work on the Trump Foundation and his groping scoop; Ari Berman of the Nation\u2019s probe into the real rigging of the election; Guardian columnist Lucia Graves\u2019 interviews with women alleging the candidate sexually assaulted them.\n\nSo what happened to all this solid work? Why did it appear to go up in a puff of smoke on election night? There is a separate and febrile debate over whether or not opinion polls were in part to blame for giving the impression that the White House was in the bag for Clinton, but many other theories are circulating.\n\nOne prevalent idea, as Hadas Gold of Politico tells CJR, is that the media did its job but the public \u201cjust did not care\u201d. The New York Times political reporter Jonathan Martin offers an opposite conclusion: that the coverage did hit home with voters, as reflected in Trump\u2019s historically bad popularity ratings. To which it might be added that Hillary Clinton is still winning in the popular vote.\n\nA third line of inquiry that is likely to run and run is whether the media, in its coastal bubble, failed to get to grips with the anger that was brewing right under its nose in the American heartlands. A flick of that argument was given in the missive sent by Arthur Sulzberger and Baquet, publisher and executive editor of the New York Times, to their readers soon after the election. \u201cDid Donald Trump\u2019s sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters?\u201d\n\nAnswering his own question, Baquet told the Guardian US that the Times did in fact write extensively about anger in America in the run-up to the election, but adds that it\u2019s a good idea as an editor to be humble enough to ask oneself what questions should have been asked during the campaign.\n\n\u201cNobody, including the Trump campaign itself, quite understood the forces that would lead to Donald Trump being elected in what everybody agrees was a surprise. A big part of my job now is to explain that in the coming months, to go out in the country, talk to people who feel anxious about the future of the country, don\u2019t caricature them, let them speak. Just let them talk.\u201d\n\nA more disturbing thought is that while many news outlets took great efforts to chronicle the plight of the white working classes in middle America, their dispatches didn\u2019t register with millions of voters for the simple reason that those voters weren\u2019t reading any of us. Amid the ongoing muscle of Drudge, the new transcendence of Breitbart, not to mention the proliferation of fake news sites, conservative Americans \u2013 and for that matter liberals \u2013 are increasingly able to receive information from within their own alternative bubble where their opinions are reinforced without being challenged by the loathed MSM.\n\nOne of the more despairing expressions of this theory was given by New York magazine\u2019s Adam Moss to CJR: \u201cThe media as it used to be thought of is just not that important any more. It doesn\u2019t matter that some people were doing good work because \u2026 we\u2019re just talking to ourselves and people who already agree with us.\u201d\n\nSince Trump\u2019s victory, another theory has been aired increasingly by right-of-center pundits such as Howard Kurtz of Fox News that flips the argument that the media did too little too late to expose Trump on its head. In this iteration, major outlets did too much, were too eager to go after him. The editor of the Wall Street Journal, Gerard Baker, tells CJR that \u201csome reporters saw it as their role to stop this man from becoming president, they put themselves in the role of partisans\u201d.\n\nIt fell to Piers Morgan of Mail Online, as it often does, to put the case most stridently: \u201cThe NYT\u2019s ludicrously biased anti-Trump barrage of bile helped him get elected.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d ripostes the Times\u2019 Dean Baquet. \u201cWe didn\u2019t cover Donald Trump any more aggressively than we covered Hillary Clinton. People forget that we broke the story of Clinton\u2019s emails. If both sides think you were tough on them, maybe that means you were fair.\u201d\n\nOf all the mainstream media bashing that has been unleashed since 8 November, one source of it stands head and shoulders above the rest: Donald Trump himself. Which is not surprising, given his track record during the campaign.\n\nReporters deemed to be producing unfavourable copy were punished by Trump: Jorge Ramos was ejected from a press conference after the Univision anchor dared to ask an awkward question; Coppins was turned away from Trump rallies as comeuppance for his caustic 2014 profile; a lengthening list of other media outlets were banned by the campaign; individual journalists were targeted for bullying, such as NBC News\u2019s Katy Tur; supporters at campaign stops were enabled to turn in anger against camera operators just doing their jobs, screaming: \u201cCNN sucks! CNN sucks! CNN sucks!\u201d\n\nSince Trump\u2019s metamorphosis into president-elect, the tendency to target the media has only got worse. Now he routinely gives the press pool the slip, showing contempt for both transparency and tradition. Back on his Android phone, Trump is on the \u201cfailing\u201d New York Times warpath, displaying a sort of frenzied disdain that hardly bodes well for the relationship between soon-to-be president and the country\u2019s paper of record.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything quite like this,\u201d says Baquet, who as former editor of the Los Angeles Times and Washington bureau chief of the Times has seen more than most. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever had a president-elect tweeting about us, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\nAs 20 January 2017 and the start of his presidency bears down upon us, much of the media will enter the Trump era carrying with them a profound sense of trepidation. \u201cThis is a moment of high danger for the press; we\u2019re heading into a dark period for American democracy and American journalism,\u201d says Jay Rosen of NYU. Jorge Ramos tells CJR: \u201cI think we\u2019ll remember this election as unique and very concerning for the future of the press because if this becomes the norm, we are in serious trouble.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just the lack of access, mocking and bullying that can be expected from President Trump. There\u2019s also the internal danger that the media will normalize his time in office under the cloak of traditional reverence for the presidency.\n\nContributors to the CJR\u2019s account of 2016 point out that a pattern of normalization was established even on the campaign trail, when media outlets appeared to be willing Trump on to elevate himself from his startlingly unconventional approach to a proper \u201cpresidential\u201d mode. In the memorable description of Tommy Craggs, Slate\u2019s politics editor, the candidate \u201ccould have gone up there and danced the hoochie coochie and they would have said, \u2018This is a welcome change in tone from Donald Trump\u2019\u201d.\n\nSince the election that trend has thickened, some believe. John Weaver, the former chief strategist for Trump\u2019s Republican rival John Kasich, says he is outraged by media references to Steve Bannon, the Breitbart chairman who Trump has appointed his senior counselor in the White House, as a \u201ccontroversial figure\u201d or an \u201caggressive conservative\u201d. \u201cNo, no, that\u2019s sugar-coating. He was the publisher of the news site that he said was home to the alt-right, and that is code for racism and sexism and fascism,\u201d Weaver said.\n\nSo what will be the role of the \u201cmainstream media\u201d as it embarks, somewhat battered but still standing, into Trump\u2019s America? Will it be to document the new administration with a detached and \u201cobjective\u201d eye, as traditional newsroom canons dictate, or will it pursue that other burning function of the fourth estate, holding power to account?\n\n\u201cWe will cover him fairly and aggressively, and we will not let his criticism of us sway us or keep us from doing what we have to do,\u201d says Dean Baquet of the New York Times. \u201cIn my mind our mission is clearer than it\u2019s ever been: we have to cover the giant story of this extraordinary White House, which is going to change American politics and policy for years to come, as aggressively, truthfully and honestly as we can.\u201d",
