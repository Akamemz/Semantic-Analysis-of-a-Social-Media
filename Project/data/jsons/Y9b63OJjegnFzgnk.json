But the decision that will either solidify or irrevocably weaken Obama 's legacy as a leader on climate change lies much closer to home in the proposed Keystone XL pipeline , which would pump heavy tar sands crude through America 's heartland .\nThe world was watching in June when the President drew a line in the sand during his speech at Georgetown , where he declared that the Keystone XL pipeline would be approved only if `` the project does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution . ''\nToday , the world is still watching , and if President Obama is to remain a global climate leader , his choice is clear .
