A Quinnipiac University Poll released on Friday found Mr. Carson easily winning over born-again evangelical voters , with support from 27 percent of those surveyed , compared with 20 percent for Mr. Trump . The poll echoes earlier results found by the most recent Bloomberg/Des Moines Register Poll , in which Mr. Carson beats Mr. Trump with Christian conservatives by a 7-point margin , with several poll respondents describing Mr. Carson as \u201c a kind Christian whom they can trust . \u201d\nMr. Carson himself seemed to provoke the issue last week when asked to differentiate himself from Mr. Trump and pointing to his own beliefs : \u201c Probably the biggest thing \u2014 I \u2019 ve realized where my success has come from , and I don \u2019 t in any way deny my faith in God . \u201d\nMr. Trump pushed back , and by week \u2019 s end Mr. Carson was easing off his attack .\nStill , activists wondered whether either man will be religious conservatives \u2019 pick in the end .\n\u201c Trump and Carson are viewed positively by many the same way \u2014 they \u2019 re both successful , both outsiders , \u201d said Bob Vander Plaats , president of the Social Leader , a social conservative organization based in Iowa . \u201c Historically , though , those on top of the polls with evangelical voters and Iowa caucus voters on September 10 are usually not the ones leading the polls on January 10 . In other words , you have a lot of game yet to be played . \u201d\nBoth Mr. Carson and Mr. Trump were absent from the rally held in support of Kim Davis , the Kentucky clerk who was jailed for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples , whereas the two candidates most likely to win over Iowa evangelicals , former Arkansas Gov . Mike Huckabee and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz , were both there .\nMr. Carson has come out in support of Ms. Davis , but Mr. Trump said it was not the right job for her .\nMr. Trump has also hit plenty of sour notes with evangelical voters , including at Mr. Vander Plaats \u2019 own Family Leadership Summit in July , where Mr. Trump spoke about his faith but admitted he \u2019 s never sought forgiveness for his sins .\nWhen moderator Frank Luntz asked Mr. Trump directly if he \u2019 s ever asked God directly for forgiveness for his actions , Mr. Trump replied : \u201c I am not sure I have . I just go on and try to do a better job from there . I don \u2019 t think so . I think if I do something wrong , I think , I just try and make it right . I don \u2019 t bring God into that picture . I don \u2019 t . \u201d\n\u201c There \u2019 s no doubt many in the audience found his answer offensive , \u201d Mr. Vander Plaats said . \u201c It \u2019 s one of those comments I think has long-term ramifications . As we get into the maturity of the campaign , people are going to start looking a little closer , and they \u2019 re going to find out there \u2019 s other candidates in the race other than Donald Trump . \u201d\nAnother misstep came in an interview with Bloomberg \u2019 s Mark Halperin in late August . Mr. Trump had earlier stumped in Michigan , proclaiming his favorite book is the Bible . So Mr. Halperin asked Mr. Trump to cite his favorite Bible verses , to which Mr. Trump responded : \u201c Well , I wouldn \u2019 t want to get into it , because to me that \u2019 s very personal . \u201d\n\u201c What do you mean it \u2019 s personal ? Are you joking ? \u201d said American Renewal Project leader David Lane , who is helping Iowa evangelical conservative pastors mobilize like-minded voters . \u201c More than likely Trump \u2019 s not the real deal from a spiritual point of view , so that \u2019 s why I don \u2019 t think evangelicals will go for him . \u201d\nMr. Lane also cited Mr. Trump \u2019 s flip-flop on abortion as a turn-off to many evangelical voters .
