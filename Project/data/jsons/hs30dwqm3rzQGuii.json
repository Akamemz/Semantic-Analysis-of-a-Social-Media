    "content": "\u201c The interview was very direct , but it was a home-team interview , \u201d said CNN chief political correspondent Dana Bash in a round of post-interview analysis . \u201c Hopefully with others will have a chance to also ask questions. \u201d Actually , others , including CNN , have already had a chance to also ask questions . Various TV networks , as this blog mentioned on Thursday , have conducted interviews with Biden since Reade \u2019 s sexual assault allegations surfaced on March 25 . Before Friday morning , Biden hadn \u2019 t been asked about the claims .\nIn her session with Biden , Brzezinski was measured , civil and insistent . After Biden issued his unequivocal denial of the allegation itself , she pressed him on the glaring vulnerability of top Democrats when it comes to sexual assault allegations : their over-the-top , believe-women statements during the confirmation fight over then-federal Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh . This was Biden \u2019 s own contribution to this genre : \u201c For a woman to come forward in the glaring lights of focus , nationally , you \u2019 ve got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she \u2019 s talking about is real , whether or not she forgets facts , whether or not it \u2019 s been made worse or better over time . \u201d\nNow that the shoe is on the other foot , Biden had to face this zinger from Brzezinski : \u201c Are women to be believed \u2014 are women to be believed unless it pertains to you ? \u201d Biden \u2019 s answer articulated this standard for the situation : \u201c Look , women are to be believed , given the benefit of the doubt . if they come forward and say something that is \u2014 that they said happened to them , they should start off with the presumption they \u2019 re telling the truth . Then you have to look at the circumstances and the facts . ''\nSo was this a \u201c home-team \u201d interview ? That may have been the thinking of Team Biden . MSNBC \u2019 s programming , depending on the hour , ranges from harsh to downright inimical to President Trump . It also antagonized the progressive wing of the Democratic Party during the primary months . When Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt. ) , for example , triumphed in Nevada , then-host Chris Matthews compared the moment to the Nazi invasion of France . Sanders himself addressed his concerns about the coverage to MSNBC President Phil Griffin . The pressure to pamper establishment Democrats surfaced again on Wednesday , when MSNBC host Chris Hayes dared to cover the Reade story . The Twitter backlash hashtag # FireChrisHayes made the rounds afterward , signaling that viewers on the left have become jealous of what news viewers on the right have long had in Fox News host Sean Hannity .\nCenk Uygur , the progressive host of The Young Turks , tweeted :\nAnyone tweeting in support of # FireChrisHayes is saying that they think media should not do the news but should just do propaganda on behalf of the Democratic Party . To be fair , that 's exactly what @ MSNBC does 98 % of the time , but even a small divergence is not allowed ! 1/2 \u2014 Cenk Uygur ( @ cenkuygur ) April 30 , 2020\nPerhaps conscious of this backdrop , Brzezinski aggressively pursued Biden on several dimensions of the story , most notably on the accessibility of his papers in the custody of the University of Delaware . The university told CNN that it will keep those records under wraps until two years after Biden retires from public life . Brzezinski asked whether he agreed with \u201c reporting \u201d indicating that the records were supposed to have been released earlier . To which , Biden gave an answer filled with weakness and insecurity :\nLook , the fact is that there \u2019 s a lot of things that \u2014 of speeches I have made , positions I have taken , interviews that I did overseas with people , all of those things relating to my job . And the idea that they would all be made public and the fact while I was running for a public office they could be really taken out of context . The papers are position papers . They are documents that existed and that when I \u2014 for example when I go \u2014 when I met with Putin or when I met with whomever . And all of that to be fodder in a campaign at this time . I don \u2019 t know of anybody who \u2019 s done anything like that . And so , the National Archives is the only place there would be anything having to do with personnel records . There are no personnel records in the Biden papers at the university .\n( Bold added to highlight a cowardly moment . ) The out-of-context excuse is the last refuge of the institution that doesn \u2019 t want to be held to account . Consider that this feeble argument has been deployed by Supreme Court justices resisting cameras in their courtroom , even though the court is now allowing live audio of oral arguments . If Biden has such a fear that his words will be taken out of context , he should leave public life immediately . Here we have a guy running on experience who fears releasing the documentation underpinning that experience .\nA key question for Biden came right near the beginning of the session , but it got swallowed by another : \u201c Do you remember her ? Do you remember any types of complaints that she might have made ? \u201d Instead of answering both questions , Biden answered the second one : \u201c I don \u2019 t remember any type of complaint she may have made . It was 27 years ago , and I don \u2019 t remember nor does anyone else that I \u2019 m aware of . And the fact is that I don \u2019 t remember . I don \u2019 t remember any complaint ever having been made . \u201d\nThe historical record provides some insight into how a Democratic presidential campaign might view an interview with MSNBC . As this blog noted , Hillary Clinton \u2019 s 2016 campaign in August 2015 was considering how to get in front of the furor over her email use during her tenure as secretary of state . They settled on an interview with MSNBC \u2019 s Andrea Mitchell , who proceeded to hammer away at the email issue for the first 12-plus minutes of the session .\nWhether or not Biden was seeking a \u201c home team \u201d interview , such a strategy would be ephemeral in any case . As David A. Graham notes in the Atlantic , the candidate will be facing questions down the road about this contradiction : \u201c He wants to quell the furor over the accusations , while also affirming a principle the Democratic Party has embraced in recent years : that women \u2019 s accounts of abuse should be believed. \u201d There are other dimensions of Reade \u2019 s story , too , that merit excavation , like the comments of former interns who say that Reade abruptly stopped supervising them . Was there retaliation in Biden \u2019 s office ?\nThe New York Times on Thursday reported that Reade herself had been negotiating an interview with Chris Wallace , host of \u201c Fox News Sunday. \u201d Wallace is a well-regarded , evenhanded interviewer . \u201c I don \u2019 t think in any case , anybody should just be believed , '' said Wallace about the Reade case .\nSpeaking of home-team interviews , we finish this post with one of the softball questions posed by Fox News host Martha MacCallum in her September 2018 interview with Kavanaugh : \u201c Do you feel unprotected by the process ? \u201d",
