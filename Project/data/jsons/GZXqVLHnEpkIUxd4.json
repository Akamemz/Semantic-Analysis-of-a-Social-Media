Let the process play out so you don \u2019 t have another situation like the Republicans had in 2012 where they got it wrong and had to correct it two weeks later . Let the process play out -- announce the winner \u2013 and then start pouncing on the party to make sure it doesn \u2019 t happen again . But for now , all this public sniping isn \u2019 t helping , \u201d he emphasized .\nElleithee , a senior spokesman for Hillary Clinton \u2019 s 2008 presidential campaign who later served as communications director for the Democratic National Committee , argued that \u201c nobody can declare victory . There \u2019 s nothing to declare .

Mitt Romney . It was ultimately revealed that former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania was the winner .\nElleithee noted that \u201c the ultimate winners \u2013 the people who can claim momentum \u2013 are all going to miss out on the opportunity to declare momentum in the moment , so they \u2019 re going to have to find other ways to manufacturer it . There \u2019 s no winner .
