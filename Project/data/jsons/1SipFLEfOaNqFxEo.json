Many of them have big Easter Sunday plans , even as some church gatherings across the US have led to outbreaks among their congregants . Glorious Way Church in Houston , Texas , plans to hold a socially distanced Easter morning service on Sunday , removing benches and using volunteer ushers to make sure family units stay six feet apart from one another , the distance recommended by the Department of Health and Human Services to help prevent spreading the virus . Solid Rock Church , a megachurch in Ohio , has stated it will keep holding services as long as the First Amendment of the Constitution is upheld , though a notice on its website says it is limiting its services , suspending collections and communion \u201c in a normal sense , \u201d and that there are not a \u201c large number of worshippers \u201d in the facility for services . A link to \u201c Easter @ Solid Rock \u201d leads to an unrelated event , and the church \u2019 s calendar seems to show that the church plans on holding two services Sunday at their Lebanon ( \u201c North \u201d ) campus , as well as some \u201c adult classes \u201d for members of the church , including a finance class and one called \u201c Marriage Matters. \u201d A woman who answered Solid Rock \u2019 s phone told \u2588\u2588\u2588 she has been advised to refer all callers to its website , due to \u201c all the bad press we \u2019 ve received \u201d for staying open . The website has a notice saying they \u201c agree we must all comply \u201d with Ohio \u2019 s order , and lists ways in which the church is attempting to mitigate the spread . However , it also insists it is the church \u2019 s responsibility to stay open , quoting this line from the New Testament : \u201c Let us not give up the habit of meeting together , as some are doing . Instead , let us encourage one another all the more , since you see that the Day of the Lord is coming nearer . Hebrews 10:25 . \u201d\nCome witness this POWERFUL moment in history ! We invite everyone out to come join us , as we observe Jesus ' last hours , through worship and skit . Tonight at 7pm here at The Bridge Church . This is a POWERFUL skit ! You do n't want to miss !\nThe Bridge Church in Robstown , Texas , has continued to hold special services leading up to Easter , Pastor Joel Garza told \u2588\u2588\u2588 over the phone Thursday , as well as its normal Sunday services . They disinfect the church before and after services , ask congregants to stay a \u201c safe distance \u201d from other families , and set up speakers in the parking lot for those who prefer to stay in their cars for service , but anywhere from 100 to 200 attendees have been showing up , Garza said , adding that he hopes more people come this Sunday for Easter services .\nSpell , of the Life Tabernacle Church in Baton Rouge , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 he is sending 27 buses out to bring congregants to his church for Easter Sunday service , and that he expects about 2,000 people to attend . The service will last all day with a rotating cast of congregants as more are bused in and out \u2014 about eight hours for the morning service and three hours in the evening , he said . Since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak , medical experts have advised against gatherings of more than a few people . On March 15 , the Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) urged against the congregating of more than 50 people . Just a few days later , President Donald Trump released his guidelines for slowing the spread of coronavirus , including avoiding \u201c social gatherings in groups of 10 or more people. \u201d Many houses of worship are obeying these guidelines , and some influential religious organizations and sects , including the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , the Catholic Church , the US Council of Muslim Organizations , and various denominations of Judaism have closed their houses of worship or are urging services take place online . As \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported last month , a poll conducted in mid-March found that nearly a fifth of religious Americans said they were still attending in-person services . However , conditions have changed and worsened significantly since then , and some outbreaks have even occurred explicitly due to church gatherings . At least 70 attendees of a church in Sacramento , California , were diagnosed with COVID-19 last week , and in March churches in Arkansas and Illinois saw dozens of citizens fall ill after attending church events . Several states that have issued stay-at-home orders have included exceptions for houses of worship . New York , Pennsylvania , Texas , Michigan , and California have all issued stay-at-home orders that either designate houses of worship as \u201c essential \u201d ( exempting them from having to close ) or encourage them to close but exempt them from penalties . For example , Michigan Gov . Gretchen Whitmer banned all gatherings outside the home , but added that \u201c a place of religious worship , when used for religious worship , is not subject to penalty '' for violating the order . Other states have directives that are not particularly clear on the guidelines for houses of worship . South Carolina and Alabama did not explicitly address houses of worship , but left them out of their list of nonessential businesses required to close . Louisiana Gov . John Bel Edwards issued an executive order in mid-March that banned gatherings of more than 50 people , but made exceptions for traveling \u201c to-and-from \u201d houses of worship . Ohio Gov . Mike DeWine \u2019 s order exempts houses of worship from the state \u2019 s ban on gatherings of more than 10 people , but he then tweeted a plea to religious leaders to halt in-person services . Even with these exemptions , some religious leaders , like Spell , have flouted directives so openly that they are now facing criminal charges .\nGerald Herbert / AP Pastor Tony Spell speaks to media after holding an evening service at the Life Tabernacle Church in Baton Rouge , Louisiana , March 31 .\nIn a phone call Thursday , Glorious Way Church Associate Pastor James Buntrock said that he has even hired law enforcement to be present at services to protect his congregation from media covering the church , or in case any \u201c activist type people \u201d try to show up to spread COVID-19 among the church attendees . \u201c Nobody has threatened us directly here , \u201d Buntrock said , adding that they haven \u2019 t had any problems with members of the press either : \u201c But I 've heard rumors of those possibilities , \u201d he said , \u201c so I just wanted to be prepared. \u201d Texas \u2019 stay-at-home order explicitly labeled houses of worship \u201c essential services , \u201d and some churches , like Glorious Way and the Bridge Church are taking that very seriously .\n\u201c We as essential organizations need to show up right now . \u201d\n\u201c We as essential organizations need to show up right now . If nurses and doctors , or police officers and firefighters , didn \u2019 t show up , it would be considered dishonorable , \u201d Bridge Church leader Joel Garza told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c Yet churches , for whatever reason , seem to feel like it 's okay not to show up when our world needs us the most. \u201d Garza even went as far as to say that he believed attending services would help people fight off coronavirus . \u201c Right now people are staying at home , depressed , it weakens your immune system , and they 're most susceptible to disease through depression , \u201d Garza said . \u201c But if they come to church , they 're encouraged , they 're joyful , their immune system receives like a B-12 , and they 're able to go do better fighting off any kind of infirmities. \u201d American Psychological Association Director of Clinical Research and Quality Vaile Wright told \u2588\u2588\u2588 Friday that there was \u201c certainly no evidence \u201d to suggest that attending church could boost your immune system , and that even recommending a distance of 6 feet between congregants was still in violation of the CDC \u2019 s recommendations . \u201c Long-term stress can suppress the immune system and that can in turn lead to illness , and we do know social contact is a way to buffer stress . However , the benefit that can come from that social contact does not have to be face to face , \u201d Wright said . \u201c It \u2019 s important that we come together during these times of worship , but you have to balance that with the public health imperative to stay physically apart . \u201d\nGerald Herbert / AP Congregants arrive for evening service at the Life Tabernacle Church in Baton Rouge , Louisiana .\nStaff who spoke to \u2588\u2588\u2588 from each of the churches choosing to remain open for Easter said they had received angry , and even vulgar and explicit , complaints about their choice , but that they see the pandemic as even more of a reason for them to stay open . The pastors also argued that they are providing concrete support for people affected by the pandemic through their charity . Many churches that have remained open have also been gathering and distributing food and essentials to people whose income or meal access has been affected by coronavirus closures . \u201c I appreciate what doctors and nurses are doing . We pray for them . They are right in the middle of this \u2014 they 're being separated from their families . It 's horrible , \u201d Glorious Way \u2019 s pastor Buntrock said . \u201c But the answer to this is not an entirely natural answer , \u201d he continued . \u201c We 've got to bring God into this . He is the answer to this . I want that message to get out . So that 's why we 're staying open. \u201d \u25cf",

Even with these exemptions, some religious leaders, like Spell, have flouted directives so openly that they are now facing criminal charges.\n\nGerald Herbert / AP Pastor Tony Spell speaks to media after holding an evening service at the Life Tabernacle Church in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, March 31.\n\n\u201cRight now I have $5,000 in fines and am facing up to 900 days in jail,\u201d Spell said Thursday, adding that his congregation continues to support him and is even growing with each service, people coming from all over the country, he said, from as far as Michigan and Minnesota. He has, at times, claimed his congregation is as big as 1,800. The Central Police Department in Baton Rouge confirmed Spell has to go to court on six counts, but said the court will decide on a fine amount and sentencing. Asked if the department plans to break up Easter services at Life Tabernacle Church, the spokesperson told BuzzFeed, \u201cAs far as us going up in the church Sunday, unless the government puts an order out and tells the chief, our hands are tied, ma\u2019am. We can only enforce what he\u2019s put out. We\u2019ve gone as far as we can go.\u201d Contrary to Spell\u2019s claims, \u201cHe does not have 1,800 people in that church. Ever,\u201d the spokesperson said. They added that the police department is on scene, monitoring the situation \u2014 but has not been invasive \u2014 and there are multiple agencies investigating the church. In Florida, state and local governments grappled with confusing executive orders that all seem to center around megachurch pastor Rodney Howard-Browne of the River at Tampa Bay Church. Howard-Browne was arrested on March 30 after refusing to close doors in response to social distancing guidelines. Hillsborough County in Florida issued a \u201csafer-at-home\u201d order on March 27 for everyone, aside from essential workers. All other residents were to leave their homes only for food, medicine, and essentials. Three days later, on April 1, Gov. Ron DeSantis followed up with a statewide executive order declaring churches \u201cessential.\u201d He then signed a second order that would supersede \u201cany conflicting official action or order issued by local officials in response to COVID-19.\u201d Thursday afternoon, Howard-Browne posted a powerful minutelong video with the caption \u201cThe Church Shall Stand.\u201d \u201cAnd if it is the end, then so be it. We\u2019re willing to die for the cause of the Gospel,\u201d Howard-Browne's voice boomed, calling the directive to close churches amid the pandemic an \u201cinsidious plan to shut the church of Jesus Christ down.\u201d It\u2019s still not clear if the church will open for Easter. Pastor Jon Duncan of Cross Culture Christian Center in Lodi, California, was stopped by police before hosting in-person Palm Sunday services on April 5. The church that rented Duncan\u2019s congregation space, Bethel Open Bible Church, had even changed the locks three weeks earlier to keep the pastor from holding services. A receptionist for Bethel Open Bible Church told BuzzFeed News Thursday that she \u201cdidn\u2019t know\u201d whether the group would be holding Easter Sunday services as well. The landlord did not return BuzzFeed News\u2019 request for comment. Other churches, like Glorious Way Church in Houston told BuzzFeed News that they are working with law enforcement to continue to hold services. Glorious Church has instituted strict social distancing rules, requiring people to wait in their cars until they are able to be ushered into the church by a volunteer and making sure every family unit is at least 6 feet apart.\n\nApu Gomes / Getty Images Pastor Rob McCoy leads a communion ceremony after an online Palm Sunday service at the Godspeak Calvary Chapel sanctuary in Thousand Oaks, California, April 5.\n\nIn a phone call Thursday, Glorious Way Church Associate Pastor James Buntrock said that he has even hired law enforcement to be present at services to protect his congregation from media covering the church, or in case any \u201cactivist type people\u201d try to show up to spread COVID-19 among the church attendees. \u201cNobody has threatened us directly here,\u201d Buntrock said, adding that they haven\u2019t had any problems with members of the press either: \u201cBut I've heard rumors of those possibilities,\u201d he said, \u201cso I just wanted to be prepared.\u201d Texas\u2019 stay-at-home order explicitly labeled houses of worship \u201cessential services,\u201d and some churches, like Glorious Way and the Bridge Church are taking that very seriously.\n\n\u201cWe as essential organizations need to show up right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe as essential organizations need to show up right now.
