With three vacancies in 435 member House , 217 votes are currently the minimum needed for the measure to win approval in the House .\nCNN 's vote count appears to bear out what President Barack Obama said on Monday .\n`` The truth of the matter is , there are enough Republican and Democratic votes in the House of Representatives right now to end this shutdown immediately with no partisan strings attached , '' Obama said .\nBut this does not mean a vote will happen any time soon , given that these Republicans have not indicated a willingness to try to force Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio , to bring a continuing resolution with no strings attached to the floor for a vote . After a meeting with Republicans on Tuesday , Republican Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma told CNN that the speaker told members there would not be a House vote on a `` clean '' government funding bill .\nThe clean CR is at the center of the dispute between Obama and Republicans , the latter trying to use the government shutdown as a legislative avenue to help defund the president 's health care law .
