The real fireworks came when Vindman spoke of the two people he talked to . The first was George Kent , the senior State Department Ukraine expert who had himself testified before the committee last week .\nFor those who have n't been following closely , it has been widely reported that the whistleblower - the individual whose complaint set off the chain reaction that has led to these impeachment hearings - was a member of the intelligence community .\nWhen Democrat Adam Schiff cut in , saying `` these proceedings will not be used to out the whistleblower '' , the audience let out an audible `` oooh '' .\nBut Vindman has testified that he does n't know who the whistleblower is , Nunes responded , so how could he out that person ?\nWhen Nunes referred to Vindman as `` Mr '' , the Army officer curtly corrected him that it he should be addressed as `` Lieutenant Colonel Vindman '' .\nDespite being pressed , Vindman and his lawyer dug in .

Vindman testified that after a brief photo session , Sondland once again spoke of investigations of the Bidens , Ukrainian energy company Burisma and alleged Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election .\nOther Democratic questioning attempted to place Donald Trump 's 25 July phone call with Zelensky , to which Vindman also was a first-hand witness , within the context of Sondland 's Ukrainian efforts .\nVindman testified that it seemed like Zelensky was `` prepped '' for Trump 's ask for a Biden investigation . They suggested that the 10 July Sondland activity was exactly that kind of prepping .\nIf what Vindman said was important , how he said it in the public hearings also mattered .\nBehind closed doors , veteran ambassadors Bill Taylor and Marie Yovanovitch were reportedly smooth while Vindman was halting and nervous .
