    "content": "Members of the Congressional Black Caucus and Women \u2019 s March co-President Tamika D. Mallory have come under fire this month for failing to condemn Louis Farrakhan after revelations that they met with or appeared at events with the notorious anti-Semite .\nThe Republican Jewish Coalition has called on eight black lawmakers to resign over their Farrakhan association . Not all have commented , but those doing so have been careful to denounce anti-Semitism without condemning the Nation of Islam leader himself .\nIs that enough ? Not for the Anti-Defamation League , which called it \u201c disturbing to see people of good conscience and character meeting with this individual whose worldview is so warped and tainted by anti-Jewish conspiracy theories . \u201d\n\u201c We hope that political leaders will reject meetings with him in the future and denounce him for the bigot he really is , \u201d the ADL said in a statement .\nFor Democrats , the Farrakhan flap threatens to fray the progressive coalition in Congress by exacerbating tensions with Jewish voters already worried about the party \u2019 s direction as anti-Israel movements such as Boycott , Divest and Sanctions gain steam on the left .\nLiberal Jews who have joined anti-Trump rallies sponsored by the Women \u2019 s March have been taken aback by revelations over the group \u2019 s links to Mr. Farrakhan , including social media photos showing him holding hands with Ms. Mallory and board member Carmen Perez .\n\u201c Many progressive Jews have reacted with shock to the Farrakhan adoration from leaders of the Women \u2019 s March , \u201d said Cornell Law School professor William A. Jacobson . \u201c That Farrakhan connection , however , has been public and unapologetic for years . \u201d\nEven before Mr. Farrakhan gave a shout-out to Ms. Mallory at his Feb. 25 Saviours \u2019 Day speech , the Women \u2019 s March had been accused of anti-Semitism through its link to convicted Palestinian terrorist Rasmea Odeh , who has been embraced by Women \u2019 s March leader Linda Sarsour .\n\u201c Rather than treating the alignment of the Women \u2019 s March leaders with a notorious anti-Semite as an aberration , progressive Jews need to ask themselves whether it reflects a deeper anti-Semitism in the progressive world , masquerading as anti-Zionism , \u201d said Mr. Jacobson , who runs the conservative Legal Insurrection blog .\nThe uproar also has touched off scrutiny of the relationship between the Nation of Islam and the black political establishment , which can be traced to 1984 , when Mr. Farrakhan rushed to defend Jesse Jackson in the Democratic presidential primary after he was reamed for calling New York \u201c Hymietown . \u201d\n\u201c Farrakhan \u2019 s defense of Jackson , which many black voters felt was unfairly maligned and taken out of context , helped establish his reputation as someone who , right or wrong , would not cave to the white establishment , \u201d Adam Serwer said in an Atlantic article headlined \u201c Why Tamika Mallory Won \u2019 t Condemn Farrakhan . \u201d\nIn a statement , Ms. Mallory said she had been attending Farrakhan events since she was a child and that \u201c it was the women of the Nation of Islam who supported me and I have always held them close to my heart for that reason . \u201d\nSome hailed Mr. Farrakhan as a hero for leading the 1995 Million Man March , a rally on the National Mall aimed at uniting black men and promoting self-reliance against economic and social ills .\nThe result is that Mr. Farrakhan , 84 , has apparently become politically untouchable in some pockets despite repeatedly denouncing Jews in public , including during his Feb. 25 Saviours \u2019 Day speech in which he blasted \u201c the Satanic Jew \u201d and said that \u201c powerful Jews are my enemy . \u201d\nEven the left-wing Southern Poverty Law Center has listed the Nation of Islam as a \u201c hate group \u201d and condemned Mr. Farrakhan \u2019 s tirades against \u201c wicked Jews \u201d and gays .\n\u201c The black community has been entirely uncertain about what to do about Louis Farrakhan since 1984 , \u201d said Arthur J. Magida , author of \u201c Prophet of Rage : A Life of Louis Farrakhan and His Nation . \u201d\n\u201c He \u2019 s seen as this guy who says what needs to be said , when in fact what he is saying is a total falsehood , \u201d said Mr. Magida . \u201c But you can \u2019 t counter him because he has such a following . Even those who don \u2019 t follow the Nation of Islam see him as a powerful black man who has possibly helped their community . \u201d\nIndeed , the Nation of Islam is often credited with helping fight the drug scourge and strengthening black neighborhoods , although Mr. Magida said Mr. Farrakhan \u2019 s accomplishments have been overstated .\n\u201c In reality , he has done almost nothing for black America , \u201d said Mr. Magida . \u201c The Nation of Islam , under Elijah Muhammed at least , had certain economic programs that marginally helped African-Americans . He has done nothing to help African-Americans economically , socially , educationally , intellectually . \u201d\nIn politics , however , where perception is often reality , black leaders who renounce Mr. Farrakhan may pay a political price if they are seen as kowtowing to outside pressure .\n\u201c If you do renounce him , are you then seen as an Uncle Tom ? \u201d asked Mr. Magida .\nMeanwhile , Mr. Farrakhan is the gift who keeps on giving for Republicans eager to bring Jewish voters into the fold .\nThe Republican National Committee issued a press release Tuesday detailing the links between Mr. Farrakhan and the eight Black Caucus members , dubbing them \u201c the hateful eight . \u201d\nA video taken at a 2006 caucus event showed Mr. Farrakhan hugging and shaking hands with several Democratic members of Congress , including Reps.
