The melt rates are lower for more affluent students , but it \u2019 s still a significant number .\nMuch of the gap between poor and affluent students comes from the type of college they choose to attend . Poor kids are more likely to attend two-year community colleges \u2014 and the melt rates for those schools is quite high .\nThis means that a huge number of disadvantaged students \u2014 who had to overcome more obstacles than the average student to make it to the doorstep of college \u2014 never even go in the door .\n\u201d They \u2019 ve already made it through so much . They \u2019 ve come so far ; they \u2019 re so close , \u201d said Holly Morrow , who works at uAspire , which helps disadvantaged kids get to college . ( uAspire provided data to Page and Castleman for this research . )\nOne high school counselor compared it to the story of Hansel and Gretel . She told researchers that during the school year , the counselors set out bread crumbs for students to follow . But once high school ends , \u201c all of a sudden , the bread crumbs are gone and they have no idea where to go. \u201d And that leads them to drift off the college-bound path .\nBut as experts have become more attuned to the problem , they have devised new ways to mitigate it . And it turns out that leaving a trail of new bread crumbs is relatively easy \u2014 and has dramatic effects on keeping kids on the path to college .\nDuring the summer , students don \u2019 t have anyone responsible for putting out bread crumbs . This means they have to navigate the path to college by themselves \u2014 and they hit barrier after barrier .\nThey struggle to decode highly confusing financial aid letters , which don \u2019 t make clear how much money they need . They lack the finance background to make huge decisions about money , like taking out thousands of dollars in loans . And since they don \u2019 t have a clear idea of the path forward , they often put off key tasks \u2014 something all of us do .\n\u201d Any kind of complexity can often stop us in our tracks , \u201d Page said . \u201c You must have times where you say , \u2018 Oh , I don \u2019 t want to deal with that thing. \u2019 But when you actually bite the bullet and do it , you think , \u2018 It wasn \u2019 t as bad as I thought it was going to be. \u2019 \u201c\nSo why are some students more likely to get lost in the forest , while others make it through to college ?\nPage and Castleman found that one huge factor is that some students have a guide : their own parents . If their parents attended college , they can help figure out the difference between , say , a loan and free money . They can tell them what to expect , and answer questions about the experience to come .\nAnother factor was that some students didn \u2019 t have the \u201c soft skills \u201d to call and ask an adult for help navigating the process \u2014 especially students from low-income backgrounds , who often had bad experiences asking adults for help , Page said .\nThis understanding of the barriers helped researchers develop a system that sprinkles and connects those missing bread crumbs .\nIn one experiment , Page and Castleman had counselors proactively reach out to college-bound students during the summer . This intervention had a pretty drastic impact on keeping poor students on the path to college .\nBut it also taught the researchers that the method of outreach was crucial . Phone and email aren \u2019 t the best way to reach out to students . They found much more success with texting and Facebook messaging .\nThese findings were used by a company called AdmitHub in the development of a chatbot that text messages students with reminders about deadlines or required forms , automation that doesn \u2019 t drain the limited resources of college financial aid offices . If students needed help , they could interact with an artificially intelligent chatbot rather than a human .\n\u201d It feels you \u2019 re doing it yourself when a robot \u2019 s helping you , \u201d one student told NPR . \u201c It \u2019 s like a tool . \u201d\nWhen Page and her colleague Hunter Gehlbach measured the effectiveness of the chatbot at Georgia State University , they found it reduced the percentage of students suffering from summer melt by 21 percent .\nPage put it another way . She told me the chatbot is \u201c essentially a naggy , knowledgeable parent for kids who aren \u2019 t necessarily growing up in households with parents who are knowledgeable about the college-going process . \u201d\nNow Georgia State plans to implement this chatbot as a permanent part of its matriculation tools .\nWe can also smooth the path once disadvantaged students get to college\nThis summer melt intervention is yet another example of the small nudges that can help disadvantaged students get on an even playing field with everyone else . But the invisible challenges don \u2019 t end there \u2014 and there are interventions that can greatly help disadvantaged students .\nA few years ago , a research team led by Judy Harackiewicz at the University of Wisconsin Madison found disadvantaged students were more likely to abandon degrees in STEM fields ( science , technology , engineering , and math ) after struggling in a challenging introductory course class , because they either lost interest or felt uncomfortable .\nSo researchers tested an intervention in which they had students write essays on how the material is personally relevant to them .\nThat small activity drastically improved the performance of first-generation students who were African-American , Hispanic , or Native American . The researchers suspected one possible reason is that this activity helped them \u201c connect course material to important personal goals . \u201d\nIn another experiment , Stanford researcher Greg Walton and his colleague Geoff Cohen theorized that disadvantaged students were concerned about belonging in their college environment \u2014 and this social concern was threatening to the point of hurting their academic performance .\nSo they conducted an intervention in which they put these students in the same room as other students and had them talk through their shared anxieties . The goal was to frame \u201c social adversity as common and transient . \u201d\nThis intervention was able to close achievement gaps between white and black students over their college careers .\nNorthwestern University \u2019 s Nicole Stephens found that first-generation college students \u2014 much like black students \u2014 struggle to keep up academically with students who have college-educated parents .\nSo before the semester , she had students sit in on a session about the importance of their class backgrounds and how it will shape their college experience , which she calls \u201c difference education. \u201d The idea was that this would help them contextualize why they may be experiencing college differently .\nThis tiny intervention had a striking effect on their outcomes .\n\u201d The first step is understanding what are the types of obstacles students face in a given context , \u201d Stephens told me . \u201c It comes from an iterative process , which starts with looking at what existing theories and psychology have to say about the question .
