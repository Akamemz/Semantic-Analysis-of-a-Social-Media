Despite an expansive flexing of his executive powers , Obama , hampered by a Republican Congress and wary Democrats , has failed to significantly tighten gun control laws .\nNow , following a new clutch of killings in places like Oregon , South Carolina and California last year , Obama 's public evolution on gun control may be complete . Instead of talking , he 's acting . At the White House , he unveiled a series of executive actions on guns , including expanding mandatory background checks for some private sales .\n`` We are not inherently more prone to violence . But we are the only advanced country on Earth that sees this kind of mass violence erupt with this kind of frequency . It does n't happen in other advanced countries . It 's not even close , '' Obama said . `` Somehow we become numb to it and we start to feel that this is normal .

''\nBut he used the tragedy , not to make the kind of outspoken call for gun control that would become familiar in later years but to call on Americans to cleanse their poisoned politics .\n`` Rather than pointing fingers or assigning blame , let 's use this occasion to expand our moral imaginations , to listen to each other more carefully , '' he said .\nIn the months to come , Obama would be called upon to react to more shootings , including one at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin in which six people died and a massacre at a movie theater in Aurora , Colorado , in which 12 were killed .\nBut the emotional strain was clearly beginning to take a toll as he wondered after Aurora how he would feel if his daughters had been caught at the scene .\nFor Obama , the dam broke on what he later named as the worst day of his presidency in December 2012 .\nHours after 20 children and six adults were gunned down at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown , Connecticut , Obama wiped a tear from his left eye and fell silent before reporters to compose himself as he mourned the `` beautiful little kids . ''\nA few days later , at a heart-searing memorial service , loud sobs rang out in a school auditorium as Obama slowly read the roll of those killed , while crossing a threshold -- no longer reluctant to start talking politics as he mourned the dead .\n`` We , as a nation , are left with some hard questions .... can we truly say , as a nation , that we 're meeting our obligations ? '' Obama said , offering to put whatever power his office held to prevent more tragedies .\nAnd Obama kept to his word -- for several months .\nBut his effort to convince Congress to tighten background checks and to introduce an assault weapons ban foundered on the power of the NRA and the entrenched politics of gun control . The Senate failed to get the 60 votes needed to move forward on legislation that would expand background checks on firearms sales .\nThe process did not only leave Obama looking like he 'd let the relatives of the Newtown dead down , it appeared to further sour him on Washington itself , a town he no longer saw as moveable by the forces of hope and change .\nJUST WATCHED Obama angry about gun bill failure Replay More Videos ...
