Some of these are annoying , like how the answer to the looming crisis of it maybe being slightly hotter in 100 years ( or colder \u2013 it doesn \u2019 t matter ) is that you ditch your SUV and ride on a bus where and when they tell you like a sucker . Some of these are expensive . Have you ever heard a liberal say , \u201c Gosh , maybe instead of taxing hardworking people \u2019 s earnings to pay for countless giveaway programs , perhaps we should insist that these Dem-voting freeloaders , chiselers , and layabouts pull their own weight ? \u201d\nAnd some of these require that you die to please liberals . Except , thankfully , militant Normals are getting tired of liberals demanding they give up their livelihoods and lives to make people who hate them happy .\nLook at guns . Normals like guns . They like having them . They like shooting them . And they especially like how their having guns can prevent criminals and tyrants from murdering them . Except , liberals don \u2019 t like guns . They don \u2019 t like us having them . They don \u2019 t like us shooting them . And they don \u2019 t like us having guns to prevent criminals and tyrants from murdering us .\nNow , this is where our liberal pals stop whining about STORMY COLLUSION EMOLUMENTS CLAUSE LOGAN ACT WAIT NOT LOGAN ACT BECAUSE KERRY VIOLATED IT MUELLER STORMY YEAH STORMY for a moment and start whining that they don \u2019 t really want us to be the victims of as-yet unpardoned felons/Democrat voters . But it is reasonable to assume that one intends the reasonably foreseeable consequences of one \u2019 s preferred policies , and the reasonably foreseeable consequence of Normals being unable to defend themselves is Normals getting robbed , raped , and/or murdered .\nLiberals want you defenseless . You know all those countless stories of good guys with guns who protect people , you know , the ones that the New York Times tells you don \u2019 t exist and not to believe your lying eyes about ? Liberals would prefer those stories go , \u201c A mother was murdered in front of her kids today \u201d rather than , \u201c A mother capped an ex-con with a \u2018 born to lose \u2019 tatt on his forehead when he threatened her and her kids . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s the consequence of the nightmare they seek to impose upon us . Liberals , who ( inept gaslighting aside ) really do want to take your guns , want you to be without a means of defense . And this necessarily means they are willing to accept the risk of death ( yours , not theirs ) that comes with being defenseless . That is , they are totally cool with you taking the risk of encountering someone who doesn \u2019 t care that guns are illegal , or who is just plain stronger than you , and who wants to hurt you or worse . In short , liberals are eager to accept the risk of you being killed in order to attain their gun-free utopia .\nOr , more precisely , they want a utopia where Normals are gun-free , and where the liberal elite maintains a monopoly on force . You think their security is disarming ? Michael Moore chance . Plus , you citizens being disarmed strips you of your last straw veto over oppression . That disarming Americans means that you are also rendered defenseless against liberal tyranny is a feature , not a bug .\nNow , if liberals really wanted to do something to stop gun killings , they would empower the cops in the big blue cities to sweep through the gang-infested warzones of Chicago and the like and rid them of criminals . But they won \u2019 t . Because they don \u2019 t hate the guns or the gangsters . They hate you .\nJust ask them . They always have plenty of awful things to say about Normals like you . When did you last hear a Democrat politician muster up the same level of outrage about criminals that they muster up about you ? Probably back when JFK was alive and respecting women .\nThis also applies internationally , and the transnational leftist elite pushes the same kind of \u201c You first \u201d suicide pact . Let \u2019 s look at what \u2019 s happening to our staunch friends in Israel . President Trump scandalized all the right people by keeping America \u2019 s word and relocating America \u2019 s embassy to the capital of our ally , and so the freakshow that is Hamas decided to send its brigades of brainwashed mental defectives running into Israel looking for blood . And Israel reacted exactly how one reacts to a human wave of howling seventh century savages . It opened fire .\nAnd good for them . The Israelis are the good guys , Hamas are the bad guys , and if you don \u2019 t want none , don \u2019 t start none .\nNow , the Democrats \u2013 who refused to attend the embassy ceremony because there \u2019 s nothing they hate more than people standing up against Third World barbarians \u2013 were fake outraged . Their media puppets went into overdrive . Why , it was horrible \u2013 horrible ! \u2013 that Israel was using violence to stop people trying to butcher innocent Jews . Didn \u2019 t the Israelis know that , like Normal Americans who are morally obligated to live at the mercy of criminals , they are morally obligated to live at the mercy of hordes who will gleefully tell you that their goal is the extermination of the Jewish people ?\nNope . The Israelis did not know that . Because it is not a thing . This is why one must never take moral instruction from liberals . They are moral illiterates .\nBut what about the all the people Israel killed ? Well , what about them ? One of the great triumphs of the Trump presidency is the moral clarity . Certainly , if she was president , Felonia Milhous von Pantsuit would be raging at Netanyahu worse than at her aide the last time he let her run out of Canadian Club . And that simpering sap Jeb ! would be wetting himself at Israel \u2019 s shameless self-defense . But Trump ? In public , he practically shrugged . Behind the scenes , I bet the Israeli ambassador was getting high-fives .\nToday , we side with our friends . And we celebrate the defeat of our enemies .\nWe \u2019 re done with bleeding for liberal feelz . One of the beautiful aspects of the Trump revolution is that America is no longer afraid to take our own side , and the side of our allies , in a fight .\nBut what about the baby who died of tear gas ? Well , that was a lie , like everything the media reports about Hamasistan , but gone are the days when we could be suckered into pretending that kind of slander was an indictment of Israel .
