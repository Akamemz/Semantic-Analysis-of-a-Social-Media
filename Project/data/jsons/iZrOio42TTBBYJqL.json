Both anchors told me after that encounter , and Cavuto just repeated to the Hollywood Reporter , that debates aren \u2019 t about them but about eliciting important information from the candidates .\nNo matter what questions the moderators ask , Marco Rubio , Chris Christie and Jeb Bush will find ways to pummel each other . And the reason is simple : Each needs to become the so-called establishment alternative to Donald Trump and Ted Cruz . Each would be badly wounded by lousy back-to-back showings in Iowa and New Hampshire . Each has been ramping up the rhetoric and unleashing harsh attack ads .\nNo way they pass up the chance to do that before an audience that could match or exceed the 14 million people who watched the last FBN debate .\nCruz , who tangled with Rubio at that debate over immigration and surveillance , will be in the mix as well . Given that he \u2019 s gently started to raise questions about Trump\u2014as a man with \u201c New York values , \u201d for instance\u2014there might be a jab or two in the direction of the man who keeps harping on his Canadian birth . But it \u2019 s more likely that the Texas senator will spar mainly with his fellow Cuban-American and the others .\nTrump , if the past is any guide , will hang back a bit and engage mostly in counterpunching . But with Iowa polls now showing him either slightly ahead of Cruz or running neck and neck , we may hear him utter the word Canada once or twice .\nFor the middle-tier candidates , there \u2019 s no point in holding back . Bush , Christie and Rubio have an enormous amount invested in a strong New Hampshire finish .\nThe last FBN debate was unusually polite because it followed the CNBC debacle , with most of the candidates outraged by some condescending and opinionated questions from the moderators . But the 2016 race is in a very different phase now .\nThese debates , with their huge audiences , have become winnowing events like never before . That \u2019 s why Rand Paul is loudly denouncing the decision to knock him off the main stage and refusing to attend the undercard .\nNetwork criteria can deflate candidates by keeping them out of prime time . Mike Huckabee and Carly Fiorina , who had been in prime-time debates , are in the early-evening faceoff here in South Carolina . Christie bounced back from one undercard appearance to the main stage , while Rand Paul is boycotting the 6 p.m. debate .
