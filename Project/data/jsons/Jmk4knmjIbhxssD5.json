    "content": "7 Moments That Stood Out From The 1st Day Of The Trump Impeachment Hearings\nTwo witnesses seen as crucial to the case against President Trump in the impeachment inquiry testified Wednesday .\nMuch of what was said by acting U.S . Ambassador to Ukraine William Taylor and George Kent , the State Department 's top official on Ukraine policy , was previously known from their lengthy depositions released last week .\nBut there were some new things \u2014 and several moments that stood out . Here are seven :\nTaylor revealed that in the past week , a member of his staff shared some new information with him about a call between President Trump and European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland that tied Trump to an effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate former vice president and current presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter .\n`` Following the call with President Trump , '' Taylor said , `` the member of my staff asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine . Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of ( Joe ) Biden , which Giuliani was pressing for . ''\nMultiple congressional sources identified David Holmes as the aide to Taylor . Holmes is scheduled to testify in a closed-door session on Friday .\nIt 's unclear whether he would also be called to testify in an open session .\n2 . Trump felt he was wronged and Ukraine owed him\nOn President Trump 's now-infamous call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy , Trump said , `` [ T ] he United States has been very very good to Ukraine . I would n't say that it 's reciprocal necessarily ... ''\nTaylor testified that Sondland explained to him that Trump was a businessman and that a businessman expected something in return when writing a check . Taylor said he did n't think that made sense , because Ukraine did n't owe Trump anything .\nStill , Taylor tried to explain that the president thought he was , in fact , owed something after what he saw as people in Ukraine being against him during the 2016 election .\n`` There was a feeling by President Trump , '' Taylor said , `` that he had a feeling of having been wronged by the Ukrainians , and so this was something that he thought they owed him to fix that wrong . ''\nKent noted that during the Obama administration , he raised concerns about the potential perception of a conflict of interest of Hunter Biden serving on the Ukrainian energy company Burisma , while his father , Joe Biden , was handling Ukraine policy as vice president . He said nothing was done about it .\nBut he dismissed the notion that Joe Biden did anything wrong .\nAsked whether there was any factual basis to support allegations against Biden , Kent replied : `` None whatsoever . ''\nHe said the former vice president acted in accordance with U.S. policy . And when asked if it was fair to say that Biden was participating in a wholly anti-corruption effort , and that Trump was not , Kent said , `` That 's a fair assessment . ''\nHe added that the president 's lawyer , Rudy Giuliani , was `` looking to dig up political dirt on a political rival in the next election cycle '' in Ukraine .\nOne of President Trump 's chief defenders Wednesday was Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio .\nHe argued that neither Taylor nor Kent had firsthand knowledge of many of their allegations and , therefore , had less credibility . Jordan dismissed Taylor this way :\n`` You were n't on the call , were you ? ... You did n't listen in on President Trump 's call , President Zelenskiy ? ... You never talked with Chief of Staff Mulvaney . ... You never met the president . ... You had three meetings with Zelenskiy , and it [ security assistance for investigations ] did n't come up . ... And President Zelenskiy never made an announcement . This is what I ca n't believe , and you 're their star witness . ''\nTaylor testified that Sondland told an aide to President Zelenskiy that security assistance was unlikely to come if there was no public statement of support for the investigations into the conspiracy theories about Ukraine 's role in the 2016 election and the Bidens .\nAfter learning of Taylor 's testimony , Sondland amended his and admitted he did , in fact , say that .\nTaking center stage were the staff counsels , the Democrats ' Daniel Goldman and Republicans ' Steve Castor .\n`` Now Mr. Kent , corruption in Ukraine is endemic , correct ? '' Castor asked .\n`` And it affects the courts , the prosecutors , and there have historically been problems with all the prosecutors in Ukraine , correct ? '' Castor added .\nCastor tried to establish that Ukrainian corruption is rampant , so it would make sense that President Trump would want that looked into . And he also tried to raise suspicions around Ukrainians who said not-so-nice things about candidate Trump .\nAs Taylor explained to California Rep. Devin Nunes , the House Intelligence Committee 's ranking member , Trump said during his presidential campaign that perhaps Crimea should be recognized as Russian .\n`` That sentiment is amazingly inflammatory to all Ukrainians , '' Taylor said .\nNew York Rep. Elise Stefanik summed up the GOP rebuttal as to why Trump should not be impeached by making two points :\n`` For the millions of Americans viewing today , '' she said , `` the two most important facts are the following :\n`` No . 2 , there was , in fact , no investigation into Biden . ''\nJordan and others laid out why it would be valid for Trump to ask about the things he asked Zelenskiy to look into because :\n1 . Various Ukrainians did have problems with Trump ( planting the seed that it 's possible that Ukrainians had some role in 2016 election interference ) .\n2 . The head of Burisma was seen by many U.S. and international officials as corrupt , so it 's a valid request to ask for an investigation , especially in a country known for corruption .\nThe U.S. intelligence community has assessed , and the Mueller report affirmed , that it was , in fact , the Russians who interfered with the 2016 elections , not Ukrainians .

A new detail from a new witness emerges\n\nTaylor revealed that in the past week, a member of his staff shared some new information with him about a call between President Trump and European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland that tied Trump to an effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate former vice president and current presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nCan't see the video?

GOP raises Ukrainian suspicions, corruption\n\nTaking center stage were the staff counsels, the Democrats' Daniel Goldman and Republicans' Steve Castor.\n\n\"Now Mr. Kent, corruption in Ukraine is endemic, correct?\" Castor asked.\n\n\"That's correct,\" Kent replied.\n\n\"And it affects the courts, the prosecutors, and there have historically been problems with all the prosecutors in Ukraine, correct?\" Castor added.\n\nCan't see the video?
