To get all of HBR \u2019 s content delivered to your inbox , sign up for the Daily Alert newsletter .\nThe greatest challenge we face in the current crisis is striking the right balance between preventing not only the damage inflicted by Covid-19 but also that which comes from a severe contraction of economic activity .\nThis is a matter of both life and death , and prosperity or poverty , as a deep recession is likely to cause widespread hardship , including increased mortality rates for reasons other than the virus . We must , therefore , find smart strategies for reopening businesses while minimizing health risks .\nAs economists , we have explored a variety of options : a long lockdown , relaxation with rules , stop-and-go lockdowns , and phased-in lockdowns by age , geographic region within countries , and by country in sectoral waves . Our analyses suggest that , assuming that minimum epidemiological standards are met ( declining new cases for one week or two weeks , adequate intensive care unit capacity and testing and tracing protocols ) , the latter approach \u2014 sequential opening of sectors starting with those least likely to generate a substantial resurgence of the virus \u2014 is the most promising .\nWhile it is difficult to be precise about the economic cost of continued lockdowns , we know the effects are already massive . In Switzerland , for example , the loss of value added is between CHF 0.7 and 1.4 billion per day . In Spain , the cost is slightly above \u20ac3 billion per day . In the United States , it is a staggering $ 14 billion per day . There may well be other less visible but potentially significant non-monetary costs , including depression and other mental health problems , domestic violence , the saturation of hospitals impacting the treatment of other diseases , etc .\nIdeally , societies would find an epidemiologically risk-free approach for reopening , for example by waiting for a vaccine to be discovered . However , this would take as much as 12 to 24 months . We can not remain in full lockdown that long .\nAnother risk-free option in medical terms would be to make the release of the lockdown conditional on a serological immunity test . But the WHO recently warned that the presence of antibodies ( IgG ) does not necessarily offer comprehensive and lasting protection . And , again , we have no visibility into when such testing will be widely available . Moreover , it is likely that immunity in the population is still too low : blood tests conducted in Santa Clara County , California , estimate that only between 2.5 % and 4.2 % are infected . In Geneva , one of the hardest hit parts of Switzerland , the estimated prevalence is 5.5 % . Herd immunity is very far from being achieved .\nCould we lift the lockdown on a large scale by imposing only strict rules on the wearing of masks , social distancing , and other sanitary rules applied in every business ? This is what many corporate leaders clamor for , but it faces limitations : Will there be enough masks ? Will people follow the guidelines , for example , by installing privacy preserving contact tracing applications on their smartphones ?\nMore importantly , relying on individual responsibility here creates obvious conflicts between personal and collective interests . Will a retailer who doesn \u2019 t have the space for of social distancing be prepared keep her shop closed when her direct competitor with a larger floor is allowed to open ? And , importantly , it will be difficult to control the human density outside their stores , offices and production sites , particularly in city centers and on mass transit systems .\nA fast and large-scale lifting of the lockdown would likely lead to other lockdowns in the near future . There are several important drawbacks to this stop-and-go approach .\nFirst , governments and health organizations are still not able to closely monitor the spread of the virus or lock down at great speed . Data lags and political decisions take time . This creates the risk of generating new Covid-19 explosions , which eventually will make a stop-and-go option even more costly \u2014 medically and economically .\nSecond , a stop-and-go period would greatly increase uncertainty , curbing business investment and economic growth beyond the effects of the pandemic . This will be not only about the dates when the economy starts or locks down again , but also about how workers , suppliers , consumers , and the markets will react .\nLast , there are fixed costs involved in restarting businesses , including payroll adjustments and commercial effort reactivation , which will have to be incurred irrespective of whether the \u201c go \u201d period is short or long .\nA tempting option for a selective lifting of the lockdown would be to proceed by age group ; for example , by first releasing those under 45 . Our computations , based on Swiss data , suggest that , compared with a release of the entire population , the risk of overcrowding intensive care facilities with this approach would be reduced by 80 % for the obvious reason that younger people are less susceptible to complications from infection . However , not all are ; many have already fallen victim to Covid-19 .\nAnd such an approach would raise other issues . Besides the fact that it is inherently discriminatory , it ignores the ubiquitous complementarity between workers of different generations . Indeed , with a sequential release by age group , firms with younger workforces would find themselves at an advantage over their competitors , but they would also face major management and monitoring difficulties .\nAnother option would be to design the lockdown release by geographical area . Countries such as France and Spain seem to envisage taking this route , with the degree of openness and freedom to commerce depending on the severity of the pandemic in a specific region . The United States also seems to be adopting such a strategy , letting states decide when they reopen .\nThe efficacy of such an approach will depend on the coincidence between the epidemiological and the economic realities . First , regional differentiation makes sense only to the extent that there is a clear difference in the prevalence of infections . Second , unless in the case of clearly distinct market units \u2014 an island or distant state like Alaska , for example \u2014 an approach by region ignores the difficulty to restructure intra-state/region supply chains and connected product markets . It distorts competition . It is not compatible with labor mobility . And it relies to a great extent on personal responsibility , since enforcement would require a control of regional borders .\nWe believe the best option is a gradual release by sector \u2014 in several waves , within countries \u2014 with the objective of avoiding a congestion of hospitals and especially intensive care units . Our analysis suggests that this is actually possible . The sectors to be released from lockdown as a matter of priority could be chosen based on the following analysis :\nInability to conduct core business from home . Industries such as accommodation and food services , construction , healthcare , transportation , and warehousing could be the targets of a first wave of lockdown release because they are less suitable for virtual work . Some organizations in these sectors have already been deemed essential and continued operations through the pandemic .\nIndustries such as accommodation and food services , construction , healthcare , transportation , and warehousing could be the targets of a first wave of lockdown release because they are less suitable for virtual work .

The second wave would concern workers in retail and wholesale trade ( 0.6 million ) .

In a second stage , retail and real estate would be allowed to operate . In a final wave , the rest of sectors ( mainly tourism , financial services , and administrative and professional services ) could reopen . The comprehensive analysis can be found here .\nThis strategy has the virtue of being adaptive \u2014 as data is gathered following each sector-wide reopening , adjustments can be made concerning the timing of subsequent phases , and protective measures adopted in previously released sectors can be copied and improved as more is learned about the epidemic .
