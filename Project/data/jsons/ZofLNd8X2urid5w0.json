Not that there 's any doubt that it was a very clumsy answer :\n`` For me , I am going to punt on that one as well . That 's a question politicians should n't be involved in one way or another . I am going to leave that up to you . I 'm here to talk about trade not to pontificate about evolution . ''\nOne might have expected the Great Whitebread Hope to be a little better prepared -- or at least be politically skilled enough -- not to come right out and say , `` I 'm going to punt on that one .

Walker showed that he understands the Republican base far better than the likes of George Will , who said on Fox News last week that press questions about evolution are `` a standard way of trying to embarrass Republicans ... We should be able to come to terms with the fact when asked about evolution you say yes . And if one syllable of one word is not enough say Paleontology . Everything says evolution is a fact . Get over it . ''\nThe sad fact is that polling shows fewer and fewer Republicans believe in evolution .\nSandy Rios of the American Family Association explained their thinking :\n\u201c Evolution has become the religion of the elite . It \u2019 s a religion to the [ level of ] fanaticism of what they would say was the people at the Scopes monkey trial , the Christians waving their Bibles who were not really thinking through the facts , they were just outraged because it was against God \u2019 s law . The truth of the matter is that the evolutionists like George Will , waving their evolutionary theory , have become as rabid and unreasoned as what they accuse the Scopes monkey religionists of doing to Darwin during that time .

I believe faith & science are compatible , & go hand in hand . \u2014 Scott Walker ( @ ScottWalker ) February 11 , 2015\nBut what 's politically important here is n't the science vs. faith issue . It 's what Rios says about elitism . Laura Ingraham explained it best in her 2004 book `` Shut Up and Sing '' :\nIt was Southern religiosity that led to one of the most vicious literary assaults on any single group in American History . H.L . Mencken became a hero to generations of elites through his newspaper reporting on the `` Scopes Monkey Trial . '' Uninterested in the subtleties of the debate over evolution -- - completely indifferent to the concerns of those who felt their traditional religious teaching to be in danger from teachers who despised them and their culture -- - Mencken gleefully seized upon the case to mock and ridicule everything he could find in the South . We owe the popularization of the phrase `` white trash '' to Mencken . He also coined the phrase `` Bible Belt '' to describe the `` bigoted '' South . In true elite fashion , Mencken approved of the elitist antebellum South of the slaveholders but could n't stand the postwar South , where power had devolved to the despised white trash ...\nAny one of Mencken 's insults from 1925 would work perfectly in a cocktail party conversation among the elites today . They repeat the same snickering about religion , the same slurs about stupidity and the same lies about bigotry . So much for having a monopoly on tolerance .\nBelieving in evolution , therefore , is an outgrowth of reverse racism against salt-of-the-earth white Southerners and a sign of liberal solidarity with the elite antebellum slaveholders . You have to give her credit for pulling that bizarre rationale for rejecting evolution together . After all , it 's not really religion that holds the GOP base together , it 's a sense of victimization . And this thesis weaves a number of important strands into a colorful if ahistorical tapestry .\nIt presents a bit of a problem for conservative leaders , however . As you can see from Rios ' unhappiness at George Will 's forthright support for evolution , people who actually believe in science ( as it 's understood by scientists anyway ) are considered traitors to the cause . And most of them are less willing than Will to buck the victimization creed . George W. Bush famously equivocated by saying `` the jury is still out , '' adding , `` I 'd make it a goal to make sure that local folks got to make the decision as to whether or not they said creationism has been a part of our history and whether or not people ought to be exposed to different theories as to how the world was formed .
