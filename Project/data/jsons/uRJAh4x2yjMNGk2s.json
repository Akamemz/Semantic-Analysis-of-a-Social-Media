The statement came hours after Democratic leaders issued a new warning that Congress appears to be the target of a foreign interference campaign .\nBiden said in a statement Monday that he would treat foreign interference as an \u201c an adversarial act that significantly affects the relationship between the United States and the interfering nation \u2019 s government. \u201d He criticized President Donald Trump for not doing enough in response to U.S. intelligence agencies \u2019 assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election .\n\u201c If any foreign power recklessly chooses to interfere in our democracy , I will not hesitate to respond as president to impose substantial and lasting costs , \u201d Biden said .\nThe new alarms give a renewed urgency to concerns that foreign actors could be trying to influence the vote or sow disinformation . Biden said last week that he had begun receiving intelligence briefings and warned that Russia , China and other adversaries were attempting to undermine the presidential election . Biden gave no evidence , but he said that Russia was \u201c still engaged \u201d after 2016 and that China was also involved in efforts to sow doubts in the American electoral process .\nDuring an online fundraiser Monday night , Biden added : \u201c It \u2019 s going to be tough , there \u2019 s not much I can do about it now except talk about it , and expose it , but it is a serious concern . It is truly a violation of our sovereignty . \u201d\nAnd in an interview on MSNBC , Biden said Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201c knows I mean what I say . \u201d\nThe Democratic leaders said in a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray on Monday that they are concerned that Congress appears to be the target of a \u201c concerted foreign interference campaign \u201d to influence the 2020 presidential election .

Russians also used a covert social media campaign to spread misinformation and posts aimed at dividing American public opinion .
