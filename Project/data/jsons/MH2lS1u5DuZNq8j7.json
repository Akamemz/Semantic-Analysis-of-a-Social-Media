But it was chaos inside the Hart and Russell Senate Office buildings .\nAbout 1,000 people protesting Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh \u2014 including more than 100 Yale Law School students \u2014 were arrested by Capitol Hill police on Monday morning , according to organizers . Their voices , chanting \u201c I believe Anita Hill !
