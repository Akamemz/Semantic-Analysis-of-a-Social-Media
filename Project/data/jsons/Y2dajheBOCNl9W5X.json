A system now in place , called E-Verify , matches prospective hires to a database of Social Security numbers and other data , but it can be foiled at times when illegal immigrants give stolen names , dates of birth and Social Security numbers .\nThe Senate group , in a statement guiding their work on a new law , called for workers to prove their legal status and identities through `` non-forgeable electronic means .

It leaves open several possibilities for how new hires would be required to prove they can legally work .\nMr. Graham , in an interview , said that in his mind the language refers to a requirement for biometric ID cards . `` This is the public 's way of contributing to solving the problem '' of illegal immigration , Mr. Graham said .\nA second senator working on the bill , Jeff Flake ( R. , Ariz. ) , said in an interview he is open to the idea of biometric ID cards but that the issue remained unsettled . `` You 've got to give employers the tools '' to screen new workers , Mr. Flake said , noting he had signed on to legislation in past years that employed biometric data .\nMr. McCain 's spokesman declined to discuss Senate talks on the current bill . Two other senators who have backed the ID card in the past , Mr. Schumer and Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois , said through spokesmen that the new Senate legislation would n't necessarily call for a biometric card .\nIn 2010 , Messrs. Graham and Schumer offered an immigration plan that included the requirement for an ID card featuring either fingerprints or a scan of the veins in the top of a person 's hand .\nLike the senators , President Barack Obama is calling for an improved worker-verification system , but he does n't specifically call for a biometric card for all workers .
