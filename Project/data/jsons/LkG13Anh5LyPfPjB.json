John Cornyn was asked about reopening schools in Texas , one of the hotspots of the recent surge in cases -- he told a local NBC affiliate Thursday that `` we still do n't know whether children can get it and transmit it to others . ''\nWhile some articles and blogs have ridiculed Cornyn for supposedly suggesting that kids could n't be infected by the virus , Cornyn 's communication director Drew Brandewie told CNN the senator `` was questioning the degree to which children can catch it and THEN transmit it to others .
