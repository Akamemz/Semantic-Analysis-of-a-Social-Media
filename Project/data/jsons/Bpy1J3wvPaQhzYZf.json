    "content": "I feel for White House press secretary Sarah Sanders . I \u2019 d be miffed , too , if I sat down with a group of friends to a spread of cheeses at a charming farm-to-table restaurant only to be asked to leave by the owner . That was Sanders \u2019 s Friday night :\nLast night I was told by the owner of Red Hen in Lexington , VA to leave because I work for @ POTUS and I politely left . Her actions say far more about her than about me . I always do my best to treat people , including those I disagree with , respectfully and will continue to do so \u2014 Sarah Sanders ( @ PressSec ) June 23 , 2018\nI happen to believe that food establishments should offer their goods to anyone willing to pay for them . Sanders does not . She thinks it \u2019 s okay , for example , for a business to hang a sign in their window saying they won \u2019 t serve gay couples . This is why , on one level , her very public dig at the owner of the Red Hen , which set off a torrent of hate tweets and threats her way , is ridiculous . It \u2019 s hypocrisy .\nOn another level , \u201c restaurant-gate \u201d is an example of the Trump administration \u2019 s unique commitment to courting divisiveness . Donald Trump doesn \u2019 t even pretend to speak to or for all Americans . Rhetorically , there hasn \u2019 t been a more disrespectful administration in 150 years . But when Sanders wants dinner , the White House is all for mutual respect . Either way , the base laps it up .\nThis disregard for all kinds of people has had real consequences , including in the lives of gay people , transgender people , migrant children , victims of domestic violence or police brutality \u2014 and the list goes on . When Sanders , or any Trump official , tweets indignantly about a slight , it \u2019 s just added insult .\nAs Trump \u2019 s press secretary , Sanders defends his many lies , his attacks , and his policies . She does her job with a sheen of professionalism , but that \u2019 s not the same as respect .\nSanders is fine with a business hanging up a sign that says \u201c we don \u2019 t bake cakes for gay weddings \u201d\nThe irony of restaurant-gate is that Sanders supports the owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop , Jack Phillips , who refused to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex couple in Colorado . The owner of the Red Hen , Stephanie Wilkinson , told the Washington Post one reason she asked Sanders to leave was because of Sanders \u2019 s stances on gay rights . The staff includes several gay workers . The staff was also deeply upset about Sanders \u2019 s defense of Trump \u2019 s family separation policy , she said .\n\u201c I would have done the same thing again , \u201d Wilkinson told the Post . \u201c We just felt there are moments in time when people need to live their convictions . This appeared to be one . \u201d\nSanders understands the idea of convictions and business . The owner of the bakery in Colorado opposes same-sex marriage on the grounds of his Christian beliefs . And so , he argues , baking a wedding cake for two men would infringe on his First Amendment rights . Initially , the Colorado Civil Rights Commission sided with the couple , but earlier this month the Supreme Court ruled narrowly on the facts of the case , siding with Phillips 7-2 .\nIn response to the Supreme Court \u2019 s decision , Sanders told the press she and the Trump administration \u201c are pleased with the Supreme Court \u2019 s decision . \u201d\nWhen the high court heard oral arguments in December , Sanders went as far as to say it would be fine for a business to hang up a sign announcing it denies services to gay people .

When pressed on whether that included support for signs that deny service to gay people , Sanders responded , \u201c I believe that would include that . \u201d\nSanders sees a constitutional right under the First Amendment to chose who to serve and not serve in a business .
