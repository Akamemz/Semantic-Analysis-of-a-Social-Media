    "content": "The Washington Post , which touts itself as `` an independent newspaper , '' endorsed Democrats in 20 out of 27 races leading up to election day in Virginia . In the three statewide races , the paper 's editorial board supported liberal Democrats Terry McAuliffe , Ralph Northam and Mark Herring for governor , lieutenant governor and attorney general , respectively . In 17 of 24 state delegate races , the paper favored the Democratic candidate .\nOf the extremely liberal McAuliffe , the Post praised his `` comity , compromise and political coexistence . '' Meanwhile , Cuccinelli is `` the most partisan , truculent and doctrinaire attorney general in memory '' and `` assaults '' the moderation McAuliffe represents . The journalists at the Post have n't changed much in their appreciation for Democrats . In 2009 , the same paper endorsed Democrats in 22 out of 26 races .\nThe rare Republicans that the Post will embrace are often chosen for their tendency to turn on the GOP . The paper praised L. Mark Dudenhefer because he `` broke with many in his party \u2014 and sided with his constituents \u2014 by casting a pragmatic vote in favor of the transportation funding bill . ''\nIn touting Republican J.
