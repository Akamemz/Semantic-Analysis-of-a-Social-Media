    "content": "After starting 2015 as the presumptive front-runner with a huge bankroll , Jeb Bush has to be ending the year wondering what went wrong with his presidential campaign , what happened to his Republican Party and where all his money went .\nMr. Bush and his super PAC burned through more than half of the $ 133 million they raised in the first three quarters this year . The return on that investment has been a drop in polls from about 15 percent when he entered the race in June to about 4 percent in recent surveys .\n\u201c He has not been a great candidate and the campaign never seemed to hit its strides despite all the money he had , \u201d said Aubrey Jewett , a political science professor at the University of Jacksonville .\nHe had to slash his campaign payroll nearly in half and reorganize into a leaner operation in October when it became clear that the spending was out of control and donations were drying up while his run had stagnated in the middle of a crowded Republican field .\nHis campaign and his super PAC , Right to Rise , have splurged more than $ 37 million on ads , more than any other candidate and about a third of the total spent by all the candidates combined on advertising this year .\nYet he is still stuck in fifth place and more than 30 percentage points behind front-runner Donald Trump in most polls in December .\nBut for Mr. Bush , a former Florida governor whose father and brother both occupied the White House and whose family name is synonymous with the Republican Party , the worst part likely has been losing and losing badly to Mr. Trump , a boorish and insult-spewing political neophyte .\nMr. Bush entered the presidential race with the baggage of his family name , which helped him with political connections and fundraising but hobbled him with the fresh memory of the troubled presidency of his brother , George W. Bush , who left office in 2009 with the country mired in the Iraq War and a job approval rating of 35 percent .\nDespite a conservative record as governor , Mr. Bush turned off conservative voters with his support of Common Core education standards and a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants .\nMore than anything else , Republican voters didn \u2019 t want another Bush .\n\u201c It was one of those cases when he was trying to sell a product that a lot of Republicans weren \u2019 t buying , \u201d said Mr. Jewett , who has studied Mr. Bush \u2019 s political career since he ran unsuccessfully for Florida governor in 1994 .\nIn addition to being the consummate establishment guy in a year when Republican voters are looking for an outsider , Mr. Bush lacked the fundamental drive needed to win the presidency .\n\u201c It hasn \u2019 t always been obvious that he has a burning desire to go out and do all the things you have to do to be president , \u201d said the professor . \u201c He just doesn \u2019 t seem to really , really want it badly . \u201d\nPatrick Murray , director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute in West Long Branch , New Jersey , agreed .\n\u201c Jeb Bush never entered this race with a lot of support , \u201d he said . \u201c He got a little bit of support mainly because he was touted as the front-runner . But as soon as he got on the stage , the voters looked at him , particularly in places like Iowa and New Hampshire , and said , \u2018 You know what ? Thank \u2019 s for your service to the country . Your brother and father had their time in the Oval Office , and now it \u2019 s time for somebody new . \u2019\n\u201c Bush never presented himself as something that was new or different , \u201d he said . \u201c I really don \u2019 t see anything catching fire there . \u201d\nStill , Mr. Bush has said he is in the race for the long haul and staying in the hunt though Super Tuesday and the other March primaries .\nThe campaign has settled on a strategy of waiting for Republican voters to come to their senses , abandon Mr. Trump and seek out a more serious candidate in Mr. Bush .\n\u201c People , I think , will go into the voting booth and say , \u2018 Who is best fit to be our next president ? \u2019 And clearly , you look at Donald Trump and he \u2019 s full of vulgarity , he \u2019 s full of insults and he \u2019 s just not serious , \u201d Bush campaign surrogate and former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said recently on Fox News .\nAlso an establishment figure , Mr. Cantor lost his House seat in a Richmond , Virginia , district in a 2014 primary election upset to tea party-backed Dave Brat .\nAfter months of trying to ignore Mr. Trump and stay above the fray , Mr. Bush has begun aggressively attacking the billionaire businessman and reality TV star .\nHe took repeated shots at Mr. Trump in the Dec. 15 candidates debate in Las Vegas , including calling him a \u201c chaos candidate \u201d and \u201c unhinged . \u201d\nMr. Bush then featured his blustery performance in a TV ad titled \u201c The Only One , \u201d in which he knocked rivals Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas , Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie for failing to stand up to Mr. Trump .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve got to get this off my chest : Donald Trump is a jerk , \u201d Mr. Bush said , eliciting laughs and applause at a town-hall-style meeting in Contoocook , New Hampshire .\n\u201c You can \u2019 t insult your way to the presidency . You can \u2019 t disparage women , Hispanics , disabled people . Who is he kidding ? This country is far better than that , \u201d said Mr. Bush . \u201c The idea that he is actually running for president insulting people is deeply discouraging to be honest with you , and I think we should reject that out of hand . A guy like that should not be the front-running candidate of our great party . That \u2019 s not how we win . \u201d\nHe joked that his outburst , albeit measured , was a form of therapy .\n\u201c I feel better now , \u201d he said . \u201c I \u2019 m glad you allowed me to do it . \u201d\nMr. Jewett , the professor , said it was an understandable strategy , but Mr. Bush risked pushing away Mr. Trump \u2019 s supporters whom he should be courting .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a fairly dramatic move to try to stem the declining poll numbers and get Jeb back in the race , but it \u2019 s a risky strategy and it probably won \u2019 t work , \u201d he said . \u201c He \u2019 s hoping there is still a big reservoir of establishment Republicans who will show up and vote . \u201d",
