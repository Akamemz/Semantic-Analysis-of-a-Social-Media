Britain and the United States will now be free to strike a massive new Trade Deal after BREXIT , '' Trump tweeted .. `` This deal has the potential to be far bigger and more lucrative than any deal that could be made with the E.U .

His message to voters tired of the drama since the 2016 referendum was simple : `` Get Brexit done . ''\nAs the results came in , Johnson declared that his party had been given `` a powerful new mandate . '' In the morning , he promised to secure Brexit , as well as his agenda on everything from the health service to the economy to immigration .\n`` And I repeat that in winning this election we have won votes and the trust of people who have never voted Conservative before and people have always voted for other parties .

He claimed that that Labour policies on issues such as the environment were popular , but were overshadowed by Brexit .\n`` All those policies were extremely popular during the election campaign and remain policies that have huge popular support all across this country , '' he said . `` However Brexit has so polarized and divided debate in this country it has overriden so much of a normal political debate and I recognize that has contributed to the results the Labour Party has received all across this country . ''\nCorbyn , who had been on the fringe of the party for decades , won the leadership in 2015 and had rejected the more centrist shift the party had taken under former Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown . Corbyn 's eventual resignation will likely lead to a push from some in the party to bring it back to the centre-left , however it is likely to face fierce resistance from the party 's pro-Corbyn base who had repeatedly kept him in power .\nCorbyn had raised concerns , from both inside and outside his party , about a rise in anti-Semitism within Labour since he took power . While Corbyn apologized for anti-Semitism and promised to deal with it , it was something that dogged him throughout the election .\nBut , while commentators had long predicted electoral doom for a Corbyn-run Labour Party since 2015 , the party ran a close race when he faced off against then-Prime Minister Theresa May in 2017 -- slashing her majority and forcing May to form a coalition with the Democratic Unionist Party .
