    "content": "The brothers suspected of planting deadly bombs at the Boston Marathon may have gotten their ideas -- and even instructions on how to make explosives from household items -- from an English-language online magazine that Al Qaeda uses to radicalize and recruit Westerners .\nA U.S. official told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that Tamerlan Tsarnaev , 26 , and his brother , Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , 19 , built the bombs with instructions from Inspire magazine -- an English-language online magazine published by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula .\nThe publication is believed to have been started by Samir Khan , a U.S. citizen who moved in 2009 from his family 's home in North Carolina to Yemen , where he was later killed in a U.S. drone strike along with Al Qaeda leader Anwar al-Awlaki . The magazine includes articles penned by Khan and others , like `` Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom . ''\nThe magazine is released through online jihadist forums -- some of which are open , while others are password protected , according to terrorism researchers . But one issue of Inspire encourages readers to seek out its information from non-jihadist websites , like blogs and even news outlets -- which publish the magazine 's content -- so as not to attract the attention of law enforcement monitoring the forums , a counter-terrorism source told FoxNews.com .\nIn a 2010 edition of the magazine obtained by FoxNews.com , Al Qaeda warns Western readers to access information from non-Islamic websites .\n`` Whenever possible , try to get the information you need from websites that are non-Islamic or are not related to jihad .

''\nMark Bederow , a New York-based criminal defense attorney , said simply accessing pro-Al Qaeda websites or publications is not enough for arrest . But he conceded that monitoring a website 's traffic could be a valuable tool for law enforcement agents seeking to protect the public from terror plots . `` The more we are learning about the Tsarnaev brothers , the more it seems the warning signs were there to consider them potentially very dangerous individuals , '' Bederow told FoxNews.com .\n`` Because of the First Amendment , we punish actions , not thoughts , however reprehensible they may be , '' he said . `` Accessing a distasteful website and publicly sharing anti-American views , short of encouraging imminent illegal action , is not enough for arrest in this country . ''\nInvestigators say a radical brand of Islam appears to have motivated the two brothers suspected of bombing the Boston Marathon , but say they have found no indication the brothers were associated with any terrorist groups .
