His agenda meshes with that of a coalition called Rebuild Rural , representing rural businesses , farmers , and communities .\nU.S. infrastructure needs are already on the radar at the federal level \u200b\u2013 the subject of a meeting Tuesday between President Donald Trump and Democratic leaders . And investment has boosted rural areas before , such as when land-grant colleges in the 1800s spurred farm productivity . But many counties in \u201c flyover America \u201d today are struggling to retain people and job opportunities .\nAfter seeing his city saved from recent floods thanks to levees built more than 50 years ago , Josh Moenning is taking a cue . The mayor of Norfolk , Nebraska , says , \u201c Let \u2019 s not just rebuild and replace , let \u2019 s rethink and reposition how rural Nebraska interfaces with the new economy . \u201d\nThe bridge and river channel in Norfolk , Nebraska , look decidedly ordinary until Mayor Josh Moenning starts to tell his story :\n\u201c The water \u200b\u2013 you see the bottom of the bridge deck ? \u200b\u2013 it was lapping at the deck , \u201d he recalls of last month \u2019 s epic flooding here in northeastern Nebraska . The flood control channel \u201c was at almost 90 % [ capacity ] and the north fork of the Elkhorn River upstream was continuing to rise . It had already ravaged communities like Pierce and Osmond and we knew this was real and that we needed to begin evacuations . \u201d\nAbout a third of the city was evacuated . \u201c But in the end , it was this levee system that saved the day for Norfolk , \u201d he adds . \u201c It was that infrastructure investment that was made back in the \u2019 60s to not only build this channel , but to engineer it to withstand and hold so much water , that diverted floodwaters out of the city and saved us from a lot of loss and damage . \u201d\nIf city leaders had the foresight more than 50 years ago to invest in infrastructure that would save their city from a monster 21st-century storm , shouldn \u2019 t Nebraskans today do the same ? he asks . \u201c Let \u2019 s not just rebuild and replace , let \u2019 s rethink and reposition how rural Nebraska interfaces with the new economy . \u201d\nIt might sound as quaint as an Andy Griffith rerun to suggest rebuilding rural America . In a hyperpartisan era in which Washington is preoccupied with congressional investigations and political posturing for next year \u2019 s elections , why would anyone invest in the emptiest portions of flyover states , especially when they \u2019 re stuck in what looks like irreversible decline ?\nBut rural America has cheerleaders who are far more optimistic .\n\u201c I \u2019 m old enough to remember when there was a similar pessimism about our cities , which appeared during the 1970s and 1980s to be doomed to perpetual decline . They weren \u2019 t , \u201d wrote Tom Barkin , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond , in a bank publication last year looking at the problem . \u201c From my perspective , the first step in thinking about the problems of distressed rural areas is to approach them as solvable . \u201d\nIn Washington , the question of improving the nation \u2019 s infrastructure \u200b\u2013 rural as well as urban \u200b\u2013 is on the radar for both parties . President Donald Trump \u2019 s schedule Tuesday included a meeting on the issue with top Democrats , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer . The two sides have different visions , but it \u2019 s an area of potential compromise , in which Mr. Trump \u2019 s proposals have included block-grant funding for rural roads .\nFor rural rebuilding to occur , a mental shift may be needed not just among politicians but rural Americans themselves .\nEvery year , rural kids go off to college in the cities and suburbs , says John Hansen , president of the Nebraska Farmers Union , a family farm and ranch organization based in Lincoln . \u201c They get good educations and a look at what more cultural , more entertainment , and economic opportunities look like [ in the cities ] . And a very high percentage of those kids stay and they don \u2019 t go back home . And they do that in most cases with the encouragement of their parents . \u201d\nRural America is a complicated mosaic . Some counties are growing because they \u2019 re getting the spillover of suburban sprawl . Others are benefiting from the fracking boom or the tourist trade . But in many of its flat , not-so-scenic spaces , rural America is aging and its workers , less educated than their peers in metropolitan areas , struggle because of few jobs and low wages . In 1910 , more than half of Americans lived in rural areas ; today , it \u2019 s fewer than 1 in 5 .\nIn previous times of stress , the United States has invested in rural America with dramatic results . In the midst of the Civil War , the U.S. established land-grant colleges to teach practical agriculture , science , military science , and engineering , which were the basis for today \u2019 s state universities and helped make American farmers the most productive in the world .\nIn the middle of the Great Depression , Congress approved funds for rural electrification . Within a decade , the percentage of farms with electricity jumped from 10 % to 40 % ; by the early 1970s , it was 98 % .\nNebraska \u2019 s March flooding offers a significant test case . With an estimated $ 1.4 billion in damage and 81 of its 93 counties eligible for disaster aid , the state is moving to repair its infrastructure . It \u2019 s an opportunity Mayor Moenning here in Norfolk doesn \u2019 t want to pass up .\n\u201c When we fix mangled highways , why not put in place the fiber optics and telecommunications infrastructure that addresses that rural broadband gap that politicians have talked about for so long ? \u201d he asks . Instead of fixing the region \u2019 s two-lane highways , why not the four-lane corridors that rural Nebraskans were promised decades ago ?\nLet \u2019 s \u201c rebuild electricity transmission infrastructure that helps meet growing market demands for clean energy and accommodates the renewable energy generation potential that the state has in abundance , \u201d he adds . \u201c And I think , finally , when you \u2019 re looking at disaster-control infrastructure , why not start planning for what we once considered 100- and 500-year floods to be more like 10- or 15-year floods ? \u201d\nThe mayor , a Republican , doesn \u2019 t exactly fit the mold of a red-state politician . He drives a Subaru in pickup country , directs a wind-energy advocacy group , and sports blue shoelaces on his black wingtips . ( \u201c I bought them this way , \u201d he explains . \u201c I like to shake things up . \u201d )\nBut his agenda is very much in line with the investments supported by Rebuild Rural , a coalition of more than 240 groups representing farmers , agricultural cooperatives , and rural businesses , communities , and families . And there is precedent for rural America taking advantage of disaster to rebuild for the 21st century .\nAfter a powerful tornado leveled 95 % of Greensburg , Kansas , in 2007 , state Gov . Kathleen Sebelius suggested rebuilding it in a sustainable way . \u201c It wasn \u2019 t that radical an idea , \u201d says Matt Christenson , Greensburg \u2019 s current mayor . \u201c Frankly , a lot of the ideas around sustainability are straightforward . In the long term , they save more money . \u201d\nWith lots of federal help and funds secured by the Kansas congressional delegation , Greensburg outfitted its new city and county buildings , the hospital , and the school with geothermal heating and cooling . Some have solar panels . Some have green roofs ( where drought resistant plants help insulate the buildings ) . Instead of the expensive old diesel engines that used to run the municipal power plant , the city now buys its energy from a local wind farm . It \u2019 s considered one of the greenest small cities in the nation .\n\u201c I \u2019 m committed to my community , \u201d says Mayor Christenson . \u201c Definitely , rural America faces challenges . But with challenges comes opportunity . \u201d\nAnd there are signs that the Trump administration is addressing some of the long-term challenges in a region that strongly supported him in the last presidential election .
