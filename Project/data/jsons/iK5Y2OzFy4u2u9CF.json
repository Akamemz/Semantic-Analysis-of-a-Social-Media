It is a bit overblown ; there are plenty of highly enthusiastic Clinton fans who are very excited to see the first woman president .\nBut it is nonetheless true that Trump has inspired a group of remarkably passionate and committed followers . And while many of these people have legitimate economic gripes that are finding expression in Trump 's `` angry outsider '' populism , what electrifies many of them is something else entirely .\nThey chant , `` Build that wall ! '' and `` Lock her up ! '' They cheer wildly when Trump says he will ban Muslims and send refugees back where they came from . They catcall the media and shove and hit protesters while Trump cheers them on from the stage . They enthusiastically endorse his promise to torture terrorist suspects and `` take out their families '' and cheerfully back his calls to let the police take the gloves off to restore law and order . They wear overtly misogynist T-shirts that say \u201c Trump That Bitch '' and \u201c Hillary Sucks , But Not Like Monica. \u201d ( A new slogan has recently been added to the collection : `` I wish Hillary had married O.J . '' )\nOutside Trump rallies , where Confederate flags are commonly displayed and sold , videos show that people are worked up , energized , febrile .
