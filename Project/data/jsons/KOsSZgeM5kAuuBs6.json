The first meeting occurred when Kislyak was one of a group of ambassadors to approach Sessions as he was leaving the podium at an event at the Republican National Convention in July.

Less than a month ago, Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s national security adviser, was fired when it emerged that he had misled the vice-president, Mike Pence, about conversations he had had with Kislyak.\n\nCould these meetings have been entirely appropriate?\n\nYes. Sessions was a senior member of the Senate armed services committee and his spokeswoman has said that, in that capacity, he had more than 25 conversations with foreign ambassadors. But the Washington Post asked all 26 members of the Senate armed services committee at that time whether they, too, had met with Kislyak. Of the 20 senators who responded, each said they had not had any such meeting.\n\nDid Sessions lie under oath?\n\nNancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, is in no doubt. \u201cAfter lying under oath to Congress about his own communications with the Russians, the attorney general must resign,\u201d she said.\n\nBut unnamed White House officials cited by the Washington Post say Sessions did not consider his conversations with Kislyak to be relevant to the questions posed to him in his confirmation hearing and that he did not remember the nature of his discussions with the ambassador.\n\nAs part of his confirmation, Sessions was also asked in written form whether he had had any contact with \u201cany part of the Russian government about the 2016 election\u201d, to which he answered: \u201cNo.\u201d If Sessions and Kislyak did not discuss the election, that answer would be truthful.\n\nHas Sessions been suspected of having Russia ties before?\n\nNot really. Several other Trump campaign and administration officials have had contacts with Russia, which you can read about here. But Sessions was a controversial appointment because of vehemently denied accusations of racism, not due to any alleged ties to Russia.\n\nWho is Sergey Kislyak?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sergey Kislyak, Russia\u2019s ambassador to the US. Photograph: Cliff Owen/AP\n\nThe Russian ambassador has been paid a lot of attention by US intelligence and FBI officials. According to his official biography, Kislyak has served in the Russian foreign ministry for four decades. He also served as ambassador to Belgium, permanent representative of Russia to Nato, and as deputy foreign minister. He is considered by US intelligence sources to be a top Russian spy-recruiter in Washington, according to CNN, which cited unnamed US officials.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nThere are at least three known investigations into the Trump officials\u2019 alleged ties and communication with Russia. They are being led by the FBI and the two congressional intelligence committees. Now that Sessions has stepped back from involvement in the FBI investigation, it will probably give the FBI director, James Comey, more freedom to pursue the investigation without the interference or involvement of Sessions, a Trump appointee.
