    "content": "President Donald Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D\u2013Calif . ) are locked in a battle of wills over the border wall . After declaring a `` barrier\u2026absolutely critical to border security '' during his Oval Office address , Trump walked out of a meeting with Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer when they refused to budge on the wall money . This may well be a prelude to Trump acting on his threat to declare a national emergency and using unobligated Pentagon funds to get the military to build a wall .\nThat would be a terrible abuse of his power , because there is no wall-worthy national security threat at the border .\nContrary to Trump 's claims , a wall wo n't do much to stanch the flow of drugs to this country . Why ? As best as can be determined , most of the heroin and cocaine intercepted on its way to the U.S. comes through legal ports of entry . And even if the wall did substantially block smugglers , the same sorts of drugs\u2014or close substitutes\u2014would be instead generated domestically , as long as there is a demand for them .\nAs for the human beings coming across the southern border , they are increasingly asylum seekers , and their cases deserve to be heard and processed quickly\u2014which means investing in more immigration judges , not misdirecting resources on a misguided wall .\nNo matter how many times it is pointed out to Trump , he simply wo n't admit that the flow of illegal immigration is rapidly trending downwards . In 2000 , the authorities apprehended 1,643,679 unauthorized migrants . In 2017 ? 303,916 . There was a slight uptick in 2018 , but nothing approaching a `` crisis '' \u2014a word that Trump used six times in his seven-minute national address earlier this week . So going by the sheer numbers , if there was ever a time for a wall , it has already passed .\nIf the quantity of immigrants does n't justify a wall , their `` quality '' does n't either .\nThe administration has already taken a walloping for its whopper that 4,000 terrorists were apprehended at the southern border in 2017 , a figure that was off by 4,000 . Yes , about 3,000 `` special interest '' people were flagged entering from that side , but that merely means that they hail from countries that are a potential source of terrorism , not that they are terrorists themselves . No one who has come in from the southern border has ever conducted a terrorist attack . Even the ultra-restrictionist Center for Immigration Studies acknowledges that the administration is vastly exaggerating the terrorist threat .\nWhat about other kinds of criminals ? Trump has never backed away from his statement that Mexico sends us `` rapists '' and `` criminals '' rather than its `` best '' people . In truth , Mexico no longer sends us very many people at all\u2014unlike back in 2000 , when Mexicans made up 98 percent of the total migrants and Central Americans about two percent . As Stephanie Leutert , director of the Mexico Security Initiative at the University of Texas at Austin , points out , the split is now close to 50-50 .\nAnd among those coming in , criminals are the rarest of rare exception .\nSince the Trump administration took office , the Border Patrol has detected fewer gang members crossing irregularly than during the Obama administration . In FY2017 , these detections amounted to 0.075 percent of the total number of migrants ( 228 MS-13 members out of 303,916 total migrants ) . When combined with MS-13 's rival , the Barrio 18 gang , the number rises only slightly to 0.095 percent . This is far from the `` infestation '' of violent gang members described by the president .\nFurthermore , unlike the immigrants coming from Mexico , 98 percent of who were working-age men looking for better economic opportunities , half of the apprehended immigrants from Central America are families , many of them not-so-threatening women and children without men , predominantly from three countries : Honduras , Guatemala , and El Salvador .\nLeutert notes that although the migrants from Guatemala tend to come from rural areas to escape extreme poverty ( often mortgaging their farms to make the journey ) , those from Honduras and El Salvador are predominantly urban dwellers trying to get away from gangs . ( Those gangs , in turn , formed after America started deporting criminal aliens back in droves . )\nThe previous unaccompanied minor `` crisis '' occurred not because Central American parents were acting irresponsibly , as many restrictionists claim . It was because they were trying to extricate their kids from the clutches of gangs trying to recruit them . `` Boys of eleven years old ( or younger ) may be recruited as lookouts and teenage girls may be eyed for becoming members ' 'girlfriends , ' '' Leutert says .\nFamilies are now coming together to seek asylum . One would think that would gain them some brownie points from immigration hardliners who were slamming them for sending kids alone . But no ! Now they are being accused of using kids as `` pawns '' to gain entry into the United States ( because , per the Flores ruling , kids ca n't be kept in detention for longer than a few days so families who come with them are more likely to be `` caught and released '' ) . But that 's not the case . Families are all fleeing together because gangs have started charging exorbitant extortions that are beyond the means of small mom-and-pop businesses to pay . And the price for failing to pay up , Leutert points out , is often death .\nIf there were lots of criminals and terrorists trying to sneak across the border undetected , a wall might help . But asylum seekers are actually trying to get caught because they want to live and work legally in the country . Indeed , as Vox 's Dara Lind points out , they turn themselves in to the first border agent they encounter\u2014at a port of entry if they can , but if those are too backed up , or if they 're forced to languish for days and weeks because the Trump administration will only let a few in at a time ( an illegal practice called metering ) , then between ports .\nAll a wall would do in that case is seal off access points between ports , creating bigger backups at ports of entry . Far from alleviating the brewing humanitarian situation at the border , as Trump claimed in his address , a wall would exacerbate it .\nRestrictionists also claim that asylum-seeking families that are `` caught and released '' typically just disappear , never to be heard from again . But that 's a highly dubious claim , to say the least . In one Obama-era program where asylum seekers were paired with case managers before being let go , the asylum seekers had a 100 percent attendance record at court hearings . They also had a 99 percent rate of check-ins and appointments with Immigration and Customs Enforcement , according to a Department of Homeland Security report .\nMore generally , the immigration advocacy group American Immigration Council published a report four years ago that looked at studies from over the previous two decades examining how well asylum seekers fulfilled their legal obligations . It found `` very high rates of compliance '' among those `` who were placed into alternatives to detention . ''\nThe report cited a 2000 U.S. government-commissioned study that found an `` 83 percent rate of compliance with court proceedings among asylum seekers who were found to have a credible fear in the expedited removal process . '' It also showed an 84 percent compliance rate among asylees under minimal supervision , and 78 percent among those who were unsupervised .\nThis makes sense : The penalty for living in the country without authorization\u2014both legal ( given that unauthorized people have a very hard time obtaining visas ) and in lost wages\u2014is so high that asylum seekers have a built-in incentive to do things by the book . That 's why , far from wasting money on the wall , it would be better to invest in more judges and legal hearings for a speedy dispensation of asylum cases .\nThe real crisis will be if Trump declares a national emergency to deal with his fake threat .",
