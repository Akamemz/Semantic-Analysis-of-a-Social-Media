Wagner yelled commands at his friend James Johnson in an empty classroom at a building in North Texas earlier this month : \u201c Face the wall ! Feet apart ! Hands behind your back ! \u201d\nWithin seconds , Wagner handcuffed Johnson , leading him out of the room with one hand gripping the metal cuffs and the other squeezing his right bicep to guide him out . Then , the two switched places and it was Johnson \u2019 s turn to detain his buddy .\nThe pair were among a group of several men from across the state who enrolled in a training program this month where they practiced combat moves , learned how to apprehend suspects and shot firearms .\nBut they weren \u2019 t training for law enforcement . They \u2019 re just men who are worried about their churches .\nThey \u2019 re preparing for the worst-case scenario , one where their congregations are the target of a mass shooting \u2014 something that was almost unthinkable a few years ago but has happened twice in Texas in the past three years .\nIn November 2017 , a gunman opened fire inside First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs , killing 26 people and injuring 20 more . And last month , days after Christmas , a shooter attacked the West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement , killing two people and injuring one before being fatally shot by Jack Wilson , an Army veteran and head of the church \u2019 s volunteer security team .\nA few days before he left for the training seminar , Wagner said a few friends asked him , \u201c Do you think you need security at church ? \u201d\nA couple days later , the shooting at White Settlement church happened , and one of those friends later told him he was right to attend .\n\u201c We 're seeing lots of other churches that had not thought about this are putting together security teams , \u201d said Wagner , a member of Life Church in Leander , an interdenominational house of worship . \u201c It 's a terrible thing that we have to do that , that you have to think about it , but it 's been proven over and over again , that it 's possible it could happen . So be proactive . \u201d\nChuck Chadwick , the founder and president of the National Organization for Church Security and Safety Management , has been in the church security business for about 18 years , encouraging parishioners and worshippers to take their safety into their own hands . He \u2019 s experienced a spike in interest in recent weeks , following the White Settlement shooting , that mirrors the same interest his business got after Sutherland Springs .\nIn a one-story building in Krugerville , a city about an hour and a half north of Dallas , located next to a State Farm office and gun shop , attendees go through the same state-certification training as private security guards . Except at the end , instead of being paid to protect an office building , the participants will be volunteers protecting their flocks .\nChurches pay about $ 800 to fully certify and train each person through Chadwick \u2019 s school . The Chadwicks \u2019 full program costs $ 620 and state licensing runs about $ 180 .\nIn the classroom , Will Chadwick , Chuck \u2019 s son and the class instructor , described attack scenarios to a group of participants who attended in early January . He gave advice on what to do \u2014 but also , legally , what not to do .\nDraw the assailant away from where children might be , he said .\nDon \u2019 t handcuff an attacker to something and just walk away .\nThroughout the training , Will Chadwick peppered the men with verbal pop quizzes to prepare them for the 100-question state exam that would come at the end of the program .\nThe second half of the training was more hands on . Will Chadwick , who typically spoke in a calm voice , barked his commands at the men .\nHe demonstrated hand-to-hand combat techniques and the proper way to strike a police baton .\nParticipants also shot a variety of handguns and shotguns as part of their certification at the company \u2019 s outdoor gun range .\nThe Chadwicks \u2019 training prepares participants for violent attacks , but they said it would also come in handy for more common situations , like church parking lot thefts .\nMany of the participants in the January class had enrolled before the shooting at White Settlement .\n\u201c It 's surreal that you 're coming in here and you 're training for what you hope never happens . And then the very next day , it happens , \u201d said Jimmy Bills , a former Marine who lives in East Texas and attends Oasis Church of Round Rock . Bills was dressed in all black with a \u201c Don \u2019 t tread on me \u201d hat .\nThe average participant who attended the training was a man with former military or law enforcement experience .\n\u201c I \u2019 d rather have me doing it than somebody I don \u2019 t know , \u201d said Larry Graves , a 65-year-old father of eight kids and Army veteran who traveled from Arlington .\nChuck Chadwick , 65 , got his start in private security , working about 20 years at a high-end auction house based in Dallas , protecting fine art , gold coins and luxury goods .\nBut after the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center in New York , he felt a calling .\nIn 2002 , he went on to develop a security program for two megachurches in Texas and became their director of security .\nFour years later , he started the National Organization for Church Security and Safety Management which has turned into a family business . Chuck Chadwick serves as president ; his wife Marian is vice president and over logistics ; and his son Will is the primary instructor and trainer .\n\u201c I saw there was a real need for a low-cost alternative to private security for churches , \u201d Chuck Chadwick said .\nHis organization is one of a handful of Texas-based organizations that do security training specifically for churches . The Chadwick family business only works with \u201c Judeo-Christian \u201d organizations , Chuck Chadwick said .\nAt the time Chuck Chadwick started his church security business , there had been at least two mass shootings of churches in Texas . In 1980 , a gunman killed five people at The First Baptist Church in Daingerfield . In 1999 , a gunman killed eight people , including himself , at the Wedgwood Baptist Church in Forth Worth .\nChuck Chadwick estimates that his business has certified about 500 licensed church security guards at almost 100 churches , mostly in Texas .\nThough inquiries about the training program surge following news of mass shootings , only a fraction of people actually follow through , Chuck Chadwick said .\n\u201c We call it emotional inertia . Everybody gets all excited about it , you know , \u2018 We got ta do something , we got ta do something , \u201d Chadwick said , `` but then nothing happens at their church and they figure , ' I guess we \u2019 re okay . ' ''\nThis time could be different , Chadwick said . Because there was video of the shooting , the visual may stick with them much longer , he said .\nA video of the shooting in White Settlement shows a number of congregants drew their gun at the shooter , but it was Wilson , head of the church \u2019 s volunteer security team , who killed the shooter with one shot . Regarded as a hero by many , Wilson was awarded the first Governor \u2019 s Medal of Courage last week .\nHad Wilson not intervened , the shooting \u201c could have been so much worse , \u201d said Frank Pomeroy , the pastor of the Sutherland Springs church and a state Senate candidate .\nPomeroy \u2019 s 14-year-old daughter was killed during the 2017 shooting , but the pastor stands firmly against increasing gun restrictions .\n\u201c We are God \u2019 s protectors , and to do so we need to be trained and we need to be armed with the capability to protect our sheep , \u201d Pomeroy said .\nGyl Switzer , executive director of Texas Gun Sense , said people celebrating Wilson were diminishing a tragedy where lives were lost .\n\u201c The system has failed when we 've got guns and churches and when some people are celebrating [ there were only ] three dead people , \u201d Switzer said . \u201c How is three dead people not a failure ? \u201d\nFor years , Texas churches were hindered from organizing volunteer security . They either had to pay for private security guards , or seek special permission from the state , an exemption that came with a $ 400 price tag .\nThat changed when a new law went in effect in September 2017 .\nFormer state Rep. Matt Rinaldi , R-Irving , said he was inspired to introduce the legislation after discovering that though existing law had allowed congregants with licenses to carry firearms into churches , they were n't allowed to organize into a volunteer security teams without paying the state .\nRinaldi \u2019 s bill went into effect a month before the mass shooting of the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs .\n\u201c There \u2019 s no doubt that what the law did was legalize what was done at White Settlement Church in forming a security team . Without the bill that passed in 2017 , those individuals would not have been able to form a security team and then who knows what could have happened , \u201d Rinaldi said .",
