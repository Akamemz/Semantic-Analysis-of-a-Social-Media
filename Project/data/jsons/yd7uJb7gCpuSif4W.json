Along with the flag-waving and calls for \u201c freedom \u201d from Madrid , the furore that followed the vote unleashed some of the darker elements that have haunted recent turbulent episodes in Europe and America : fake news , Russian mischief and , marching oddly in step , libertarian activism .\nFrom his residence of more than five years inside the Ecuadorian embassy in London , Assange tweeted 80 times in support of Catalan secession , and his views were amplified by the state-run Russian news agency , Sputnik , making him the most quoted English-language voice on Twitter , according to independent research and the Sydney Morning Herald .\nJared Kushner failed to disclose emails sent to Trump team about WikiLeaks and Russia Read more\nIn second place was Edward Snowden , another champion of transparency , who like Assange had little by way of a track record on Spanish politics . Together , Snowden and Assange accounted for a third of all Twitter traffic under the # Catalonia hashtag .\nAt the same time , a European Union counter-propaganda unit detected an upsurge in pro-Kremlin fake news on the political crisis , playing up the tensions .\n\u201c World powers prepare for war in Europe , \u201d one Russian politics site declared in its headline .\nThe same patterns were apparent in the Brexit vote , Donald Trump \u2019 s shock victory , the surge of the Front National in France and the dramatic ascent of the Five Star Movement in Italy , from the pet project of a comedian , Beppe Grillo , to the second most powerful force in Italy .\nIn all cases , libertarians viscerally opposed to centralised power made common cause with a brutally autocratic state apparatus in Moscow , an American plutocrat with a deeply murky financial record , and the instinctively authoritarian far right . All in the name of disruption of government and liberal norms in western democracies .\nSo why are the pioneering crusaders of total transparency and freedom of information lining up alongside the most powerful exponents of disinformation and disruption ?\nThis has not just been a marriage of convenience . There are elements of ideological bonding too . In Twitter direct messages during the last throes of the US election campaign , released over the past week , WikiLeaks , which US intelligence has deemed a tool of Russian intelligence , attempted to woo Trump \u2019 s eldest son , Donald Trump Jr , with offers of secret collusion .\nThe messages from the official WikiLeaks account , first published in the Atlantic , ask for a leak of the future president \u2019 s tax return to soften the blow of its eventual publication , and to give WikiLeaks the appearance of impartiality given it had already released a trove of documents hacked from the Democratic party ( by Russia , according to US intelligence ) .\nDonald Jr only replied occasionally to the WikiLeaks emails , but appears in some case to have acted on them , notifying colleagues . In one instance , his father tweeted a reference to WikiLeaks 15 minutes after the group had been in touch .\nWikiLeaks grew steadily bolder in its proposals , urging the Trump campaign not to concede on election night if he lost but to challenge the result as rigged . And in mid-December , when Trump was president-elect , it suggested Trump should push for Assange to be made Australian ambassador to Washington .\nAssange also gave his backing to the Brexit vote in the UK , an intervention which again does not appear to be merely incidental . It earned him an unannounced visit in March from Nigel Farage , the Brexit leader and Trump \u2019 s closest British ally . When doorstopped on his way out of the Ecuadorian embassy , Farage claimed he could not remember why he had gone there .\nIn recent weeks , it has become increasingly clear that Brexit was another arena in which Assange and Moscow were in step . Over the past week , researchers at the University of Edinburgh identified more than 400 fake Twitter accounts apparently run from St Petersburg , which published Brexit-related posts in the run-up to the UK referendum , some of them aimed at stirring anti-Islamic sentiment .\nThey \u2019 re completely at odds with each other in every other sense but share a hatred of establishment western politics Jamie Bartlett , Demos\n\u201c The radical libertarians and the autocrats are allied by virtue of sharing an enemy which is the mainstream , soft , establishment , liberal politics , \u201d said Jamie Bartlett , the director of the centre for the analysis of social media at the Demos thinktank .\n\u201c Most early , hardline cryptographers who were part of this movement in the 1990s considered that democracy and liberty were not really compatible . Like most radical libertarians \u2013 as Assange was \u2013 the principal enemy was the soft democrats who were imposing the will of the majority on the minority and who didn \u2019 t really believe in genuine , absolute freedom . \u201d\nThat meant some odd bedfellows could become useful allies . \u201c They have been able to forge a very convenient marriage with other enemies of liberal democracy , \u201d said Bartlett , \u201c who are in every other sense imaginable completely at odds with each other , but they do share that common hatred of establishment , western , soft , democratic politics as they see it . \u201d\nEdward Snowden \u2019 s worldview also had libertarian roots . He was a supporter of the rightwing maverick US presidential candidate , Ron Paul , and vigorously opposed the Obama administration \u2019 s endorsement of gun control and affirmative action .\nHe turned against his employers in the US security apparatus , and stole their secrets in the name of transparency and the citizen \u2019 s right to privacy , but his defection has left him in exile in Moscow , at the mercy of a government that hardly even pretends to observe such western niceties .\nHowever , Snowden has never professed any great enthusiasm for Russian governance , and most of the available evidence suggests he did not end up in Russia by design , but because of a failed scheme , hatched by WikiLeaks to fly him from Hong Kong to Latin America . Unlike Assange , he has been increasingly critical of the Kremlin .\nBut there are plenty of other examples of the mutual embrace between Moscow and western libertarianism . In particular , the libertarians share with Moscow a profound distaste for the European Union , which they see as a continent-wide epitome of centralisation , and of liberal social norms .\n\u201c This libertarian hatred of political correctness , that everyone has to follow this social democratic view on gender , welfare , progressive politics and immigration , and libertarians can \u2019 t stand that , as degrading the idea of individual liberty , \u201d Bartlett said . \u201c So I think you \u2019 ll find quite a lot of people on the libertarian right who think that Russia has become the only real counterbalance to that philosophy . \u201d\nThe meeting of minds is embodied in the man long seen as Trump \u2019 s chief ideologue , Steve Bannon . Bannon is another western libertarian for whom the contradiction between opposing restrictions on individual liberties at home and backing Russian authoritarianism is subsumed beneath an admiration for Putin \u2019 s muscular nationalism .\nIn the summer of 2014 , Bannon explained the attraction of the Russian leader for \u201c traditionalists \u201d , to a meeting of conservative Catholics through a Skype link to the Vatican .\n\u201c One of the reasons is that they believe that at least Putin is standing up for traditional institutions , and he \u2019 s trying to do it in a form of nationalism \u2013 and I think that people , particularly in certain countries , want to see sovereignty for their country , they want to see nationalism for their country , \u201d Bannon said , according to a transcript of the discussion published by BuzzFeed .\n\u201c They don \u2019 t believe in this kind of pan-European Union or they don \u2019 t believe in the centralized government in the United States . They \u2019 d rather see more of a states-based entity that the founders originally set up where freedoms were controlled at the local level . \u201d\nFor Farage too , reverence for Putin \u2019 s boldness on the world stage has outweighed doubts about his repressive rule . Asked in a 2014 GQ magazine interview , which world leader he most admired , he said : \u201c As an operator , but not as a human being , I would say Putin .\n\u201c The way he played the whole Syria thing .
