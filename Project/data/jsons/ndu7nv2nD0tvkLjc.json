Following the simultaneous terrorist attacks at Charlie Hebdo 's editorial offices and a kosher deli , the White House failed to send a high-level American representative to a powerfully defiant march through the streets of Paris the following weekend . Team Obama later conceded this was an error , admitting that they did n't realize the protest was going to be such a big deal . It turned out that the administration had n't even given preliminary consideration the president 's attendance ; the Attorney General was in France that day , but declined to attend the march , citing dubious scheduling conflicts . Last week , the president set off a firestorm of criticism by admonishing Christians at the annual National Prayer Breakfast not to ride a `` high horse '' regarding ISIS because terrible acts had also been carried out in the name of Christianity in the past . Jonah Goldberg -- not a Christian , I might add -- dissected Obama 's facile comments in a very strong column . Even some prominent lefties felt compelled to knock the president for his tone deaf and strange moral equivalency -- in which he refused to identify ISIS with Islam , but happily pinned last sins on people purporting to act in the name of Christ . The fiction that radical Islamists having nothing to do with Islam is a recurring , politically-correct theme within administration talking points . Then came Obama 's propaganda session with the liberal blog , in which the president characterized terrorists ' decision to target a Kosher deli as `` random : '' This inelegant description could have been dismissed as a slip of the tongue , but the White House and State Department are doubling down , arguing that patrons of a Jewish deli were n't targeted on purpose . The victims `` were killed not because of who they were , but because where they randomly happened to be , '' Josh Earnest said with a straight face today : He followed up with the non-sequitur that those murdered were n't selected `` by name .

Of course this was an anti-Semitic attack . Of course anti-Semitism is a huge problem within Muslim communities , both in the Middle East and throughout Europe .
