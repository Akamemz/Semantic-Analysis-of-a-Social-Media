    "content": "Fireworks manufacturers have been on something of a winning streak of late : Sales of both low-and high-grade celebratory explosives in the U.S. are projected to top $ 1 billion this year ; more states than ever now allow consumers to buy sparklers , Roman candles and other do-it-yourself pyrotechnics . Obscure regulations are being scaled back to help light up the country 's summertime skies .\nBut with the Fourth of July busy season bearing down , the industry says it still has one big problem : President Barack Obama 's administration .\nWhether it be duplicative safety rules on the fireworks themselves or requirements that truckers limit their weekly time on the road , the makers , marketers and distributors of pyrotechnics complain that Obama 's regulators are `` completely insane '' by forcing so many standards on an industry that 's as much a part of a patriotic summer as baseball and apple pie .\nOfficials at the Consumer Product Safety Commission counter that the fireworks industry is still operating in a danger zone . Data released last Friday counted 11 fatalities and more than 10,000 injuries from fireworks in 2014 . While the number of injuries in the country was down from the prior year , CPSC communications director Scott Wolfson warned `` that 's an unacceptable number , '' especially as more states open up their markets to legal fireworks .\nJulie Heckman is the executive director of the American Pyrotechnics Association . | \u2588\u2588\u2588 | \u2588\u2588\u2588\nAmid her busy season , American Pyrotechnics Association executive director Julie Heckman recently sat down with \u2588\u2588\u2588 senior writer Darren Samuelsohn to explain why she wo n't have a break until after July 5th , once she 's checked in with the operators of some 15,000 professional display performances across the country . She also talked about why it 's been so challenging in dealing with a rotating cast of Obama administration political officials and how her industry deals with safety concerns when so much of its product comes from China .\nDarren Samuelsohn : What is the Fourth of July period like for your organization ?\nJulie Heckman : It is very nerve-racking . You know , it 's our Christmas season , if you will . We love dealing with the press , the media , but there is always that concern that your phone 's going to ring with potentially bad news that something went wrong somewhere . We 're prepared for it , we pray it does n't happen , and we just want to get through July 5th and read the headlines that everything went off perfectly .\nDS : States are definitely more friendly to fireworks today \u2014 47 states and Washington D.C. now allow some or all types of consumer fireworks . Why are we seeing so many states loosen their fireworks prohibitions ?\nJH : The move in relaxing the laws is really driven a little bit by the economy and it 's also because the lack of enforcement\u2026 . People are going to celebrate on the Fourth of July with fireworks , and typically they will cross state lines , county lines . They 'll bring their fireworks back to their home where it might not be legal . And so , with enforcement , as well as with looking at the amount of revenue generated from , you know , selling fireworks , states are saying , `` Hey , we do n't want to lose that revenue . We 'd like to gain it in our state . '' And they 're looking at special taxes that help support perhaps fireworks training for the enforcement officials or a special fund that they can generate that money with .\nDS : Only three states still have complete prohibitions on fireworks : Delaware , Massachusetts and New Jersey . Why are they holding out ?\nJH : You know , it 's interesting . Those bans have been on the books since the early 1900s . I 'm hearing there 's possible legislation going to move in Massachusetts and Delaware , but I do n't know why New Jersey 's not forging ahead .\nDS : What do you make of the CPSC \u2019 s latest data out last Friday , showing fireworks fatalities were up in 2014 , while there were fewer injuries ?\nJH : I think when you look at the statistics published by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission with regard to firework-related injuries , actually , it 's very positive . We look at the consumption , the overall usage of backyard consumer fireworks has increased significantly during the past decade , and when you look at the use of fireworks and compare then the number of injuries , actually , the injury rate has declined . I 'm not aware of one other consumer product on the market today where the usage has risen so dramatically , yet the injuries have gone down .\nDS : How do you guarantee safety when such large percentages of the fireworks consumed in the U.S. \u2014nearly all consumer products , and about 75 percent of the display fireworks \u2014 come from China ?\nJH : The industry has been very committed to working with the foreign manufacturers over in China . In fact , through the APA , another organization was created , the American Fireworks Standards Laboratory , which is a third-party certification organization . They actually test the product in China to make certain that not only does it meet the Consumer Product Safety Commission regulations , it exceeds them , because AFSL standards go a step beyond what the federal government mandates . And you know , the product has improved significantly , so we 're very proud of that .\nDS : How did the West Coast labor dispute affect the Chinese firework imports ?\nJH : We were very nervous at the end of lunar new year , because that is when the vast majority of fireworks leave China to arrive on the West Coast ports . We had volumes of containers sitting out in the Pacific Ocean waiting to get in . We 've been fortunate . All the product is here for this Fourth of July . It could have been far worse .\nDS : You are backing legislation from Sen. Lamar Alexander , the PORTS Act , that would give state governors more power to intervene in labor disputes like the one that recently ended on the West Coast . Why ?\nJH : We do not want to see any industries go through the disruptions that occurred on the West Coast this year . \u2026We think it 's really important that when there is a lockout and there is a disagreement to try and get these contracts solved that the governors can take action .\nDS : What 's your biggest ask on Capitol Hill this session ?\nJH : Right now we are advocating for reauthorization of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act . That will fix a few issues for us , including the ongoing problems with EX [ explosives ] approvals and special permits , fixing the hazmat safety permit program , and also addressing duplicative background checks .\nDS : What do you see as the chances for action on that bill this year ?\nJH : Oh , it 's been going on forever . It 's kind of interesting . You feel like , how many years have I been working on this , will I ever see reauthorization ? Again , cautiously optimistic . I do n't know if it will move with the larger surface transportation bill or not , but we 're going to continue to focus on those several key issues .\nDS : The CSPC agreed to review its safety standards this year for fireworks . What are you hoping will come out of this ?\nJH : I think the primary issue that the firework industry has right now with the Consumer Product Safety Commission is the testing for audible effect . That ear test needs to go away . We need something that can be replicated in the field , predominantly in China using a lab so that everybody 's on the same level . Because what 's loud to me might not be loud to you .\nDS : Your members have called for more reforms to the permitting process for the firework industry at both the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration . Have those agencies been doing a better job from your perspective ?\nJH : I think both PHMSA and FMCSA have done a pretty decent job at trying to improve their programs over the past several years , but I think within this administration we 've seen too many changes . You know , by the time you get an administrator really engaged in your issues and her team , the support team , working on them , there 's been a shift . We 've had acting administrators in both agencies that are now being replaced again . And so , you kind of start all over with the educational standpoint of what 's important to your industry .\nWe 're one of hundreds of industries that the agency has to focus on . Right now I think PHMSA in particular is worried about crude oil , and FMCSA has to worry more about passenger vehicles , because ... that 's where the accidents are .\nDS : How would you size up the Obama administration \u2019 s regulatory approach for your industry ?\nJH : I 've been working with the industry for a very long time , 26 years . I have never seen as many rulemaking initiatives as I have with this administration . It has just been completely insane . You know , I 'm not saying it 's necessary , but it would be really great when \u2014 take a tiny industry like fireworks , and we 've got to comply with ATF , CPSC , EPA , OSHA , multiple divisions of the Department of Transportation , it 's really challenging . It would be great if we could have one agency that took care of everything , and I 'm sure there are other industries that are also feeling that pain , but it has been very significant .\nDS : You did get a big win in April when PHMSA removed a requirement for the fireworks industry to get a permit for each individual product , even when the actual ingredients in it were the same but only the name was different .\nJH : We were extremely pleased when PHMSA decided to not require a new EX [ explosives ] application come in for an additional name on a firework item . ... We think that 's going to help eliminate the backlog in some of the work for PHMSA .\nDS : Your industry is also getting what it wants concerning driving time restrictions on truckers too ?\nJH : We 're very concerned about the hours of service . ... We basically echo the concerns of the American Trucking Association . Our folks are so heavily regulated and , while most people do n't think about the firework industry except one day a year , Fourth of July , we have to comply with everything . And we do have an hours-of-service exemption , very , very narrow , provides some relief for our companies during the ten days around the Fourth of July so that they are able to take their rest time and not count it towards their driving time . So , Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration has been generous to us because of our safety record -- we 've proven our safety record over a ten-year period with having this exemption . And so , that 's a key matter that we 're very interested in .\nDS : Given the state action and some of these regulation moves , it actually sounds like your industry is on something of a winning streak ?\nJH : We 're a very tiny industry , just barely over a billion dollars . We do n't have big lobbying dollars . You can talk about lobbying , you 're looking at the lobbyist right here . We have a great commodity , we have a great industry record to promote , and I think when we do go to Capitol Hill for support , members of Congress listen to us . I mean , we 're small \u2014 [ we ] represent small family businesses who are trying to do their very best to survive . And so , we pick and choose our asks very carefully . We want the industry to be regulated , we just want common sense regulations .",
