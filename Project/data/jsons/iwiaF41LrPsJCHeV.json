    "content": "Missouri voters made history on Tuesday , blocking the state \u2019 s Republican lawmakers from enacting right-to-work laws to cripple labor unions . The state \u2019 s primary voters rejected Proposition A , which would have made it illegal for unions to charge fees to workers they represent who don \u2019 t want to pay them , by a two-to-one margin when the vote was called by Decision Desk around 10 pm Eastern .\nMissouri was on track to become the 28th state to enact such a law . Last year , the state \u2019 s then-governor , Republican Eric Greitens , signed the right-to-work bill , saying that it would encourage businesses to move to the state . Missouri would have followed Michigan , Wisconsin , and other Rust Belt states that have passed similar anti-union measures in recent years under pressure from business groups .\nBut workers and union leaders in Missouri put up a fight . They gathered about 300,000 signatures \u2014 more than double the number needed \u2014 to freeze the law and put it on the ballot for voters to decide . On Tuesday , voters rejected the bill .\nTuesday \u2019 s election marks the first time voters have overturned a right-to-work law through a ballot referendum since Ohio did something similar in 2011 . No other state has even tried to in recent years . It \u2019 s also a major victory for the US labor movement at a time when Republican leaders , big businesses , and the courts have doubled down on their attempts to weaken the influence of labor unions and the workers they represent . And after the US Supreme Court \u2019 s June ruling in Janus v. AFSCME , which mandated right-to-work rules for all government unions , Missouri \u2019 s vote is a sign that unions are far from dead . They might even see a revival .\nWorkers have been waging a war in Missouri to defeat the law\nIn states without right-to-work laws , employees at unionized workplaces don \u2019 t have to pay union dues , but they do have to pay \u201c agency fees. \u201d These fees are lower than the dues members pay , but they cover the union \u2019 s cost of negotiating employment contracts that benefit all workers . Right-to-work laws make it illegal for a union to charge those fees , which can strain its finances and give workers an incentive not to pay dues . This is known as the \u201c free rider \u201d problem , in which some workers benefit from union contracts but choose not to pay for it .\nBut workers and unions in Missouri have fought back . They built a massive campaign to defeat the Republican law , gathering 300,000 signatures to put the referendum on the ballot . Construction workers , ironworkers , and steelworkers knocked on about half a million doors to mobilize voters to the polls , according to the AFL-CIO , the nation \u2019 s largest federation of unions . A union-backed group raised $ 15 million for the effort \u2014 more than five times the amount of money raised by two business groups supporting the right-to-work bill .\nLabor groups had framed the issue as a fight between workers and greedy billionaires . The campaign even enlisted actor John Goodman , a Missouri native , for a 30-second radio ad .\n\u201c The bill will not give you the right to work , \u201d Goodman says in the spot . \u201c It \u2019 s being sold as a way to help Missouri workers , but look a little deeper and you \u2019 ll see it \u2019 s all about corporate greed . \u201d\nThat message has resonated with unionized workers across the country , whose wages remain flat as CEOs earn record-high salaries and corporations reap massive tax cuts .\nTeachers across the country have led the revolt against such pro-business policies that swept through conservative states in the past decade \u2014 policies that never led to the promised economic boom .

With support from pro-business groups , lawmakers began to expand right-to-work laws from the South to Midwestern states with a strong union presence .\nIn 2012 , lawmakers in Indiana and Michigan passed these laws .
