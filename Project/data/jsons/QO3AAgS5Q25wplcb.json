    "content": "Vaping THC may be behind many of the serious lung diseases that have been tied to e-cigarette use\u2013\u2013raising concerns about an increasingly popular way of consuming marijuana , which many consumers view as a relatively safe habit .\nUp to 450 people have developed illnesses and at least four people have died after using e-cigarettes , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) officials said on a call with reporters Friday . While the CDC and Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) have not found a device , product or substance that is linked to all cases , a paper published Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests that many sick individuals vaped THC , a compound in marijuana , before developing an illness , either instead of or in addition to nicotine . CDC and public-health officials confirmed this finding .\nThe investigation threatens to shatter many people \u2019 s perceptions of marijuana as safe and natural , an opinion that has gained steam as the drug is legalized in more and more states . A 2018 Gallup poll found that Americans largely view both marijuana and e-cigarettes as less harmful than cigarettes , and that more than 40 % of respondents thought marijuana was \u201c not too \u201d or \u201c not at all \u201d harmful . But a growing number of illnesses apparently tied to vaping THC may change some users \u2019 minds\u2014and remove the health halo that often surrounds vaping .\nThe recent illnesses have surprised Ziva Cooper , research director of the University of California Los Angeles Cannabis Research Initiative . \u201c If you had called me a month ago and asked me about the risks of vaporizing relative to smoking , I would have had a very different answer based on the literature thus far , \u201d Cooper says . \u201c This is an issue that deserves immediate attention . \u201d\nE-cigarettes work by heating substances\u2014most often liquid nicotine , but also marijuana flowers or compounds suspended in oils\u2014into aerosols that can be inhaled . Although it \u2019 s a source of debate , this process is thought to be healthier than traditional smoking , since burning substances such as tobacco or marijuana creates byproducts that can harm the lungs and overall health . Cooper says a handful of studies on vaping cannabis have suggested that using e-cigarettes is less harmful to the lungs than smoking marijuana .\nPerhaps in part because of that belief , vaping marijuana has grown increasingly popular . In Colorado\u2014the poster child of legal marijuana use\u2014there was a 78 % increase in the number of marijuana concentrates ( a category that includes vape products ) sold to consumers from 2017 to 2018 , according to state Department of Revenue data . ( Marijuana flowers still make up a larger share of the total market , the data shows\u2013\u2013but the proportion is changing as concentrate sales rise . )\nAnd it \u2019 s not just legal users who are vaping marijuana : About 13 % of high school seniors said they had in a federal survey released in December 2018 . And the CDC has specifically warned consumers against using \u201c bootleg \u201d vape pen cartridges .\nBy 2022 , U.S. cannabis concentrates sales , driven by vaping products , are projected to hit $ 8.4 billion\u2014only slightly less than sales of marijuana flowers , according to a report from marketing firm Arcview , which focuses on the cannabis industry .\nGet The Brief .
