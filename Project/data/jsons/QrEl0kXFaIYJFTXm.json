    "content": "Republican leaders faced an immediate backlash Thursday after revealing their Obamacare replacement bill , leaving campaign vows to repeal the 2010 health care law in doubt as the Senate pushes toward a showdown on the chamber floor next week .\nThe bill , announced by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , softens the edges of an earlier House version that President Trump reportedly called \u201c mean . \u201d\nThe 142-page plan would extend the life of President Obama \u2019 s Medicaid expansion and offer more generous subsidies for the poor and those approaching retirement age . It removes Obamacare \u2019 s \u201c individual mandate \u201d and unwinds the health care exchanges , but it maintains the 2010 law \u2019 s guarantees that let young adults stay on their parents \u2019 plans and guarantees coverage despite pre-existing conditions .\n\u201c Obamacare is a direct attack on the middle class , and American families deserve better than its failing status quo \u2014 they deserve better care , \u201d Mr. McConnell said as he went to the Senate floor to publicly announce the plan , which was drafted in secret .\nDemocrats uniformly oppose the bill , meaning Republicans can not lose more than two of their 52 members in a vote .\nYet four have already said they can \u2019 t vote for it , as it stands .\nSEE ALSO : Cassidy : Republican health care bill should pass once concerns are addressed\nSens . Rand Paul of Kentucky , Ron Johnson of Wisconsin , Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah said they opposed the draft legislation for a variety of reasons , but they are open to negotiation before the bill hits the floor .\nMr. Johnson said he feels rushed , while the others worry that they are turning the dials on Obamacare instead of fulfilling their pledge to kill it .\n\u201c Somebody \u2019 s going to have to look at this bill and say we \u2019 re going to make it look more like repeal and less like we \u2019 re keeping Obamacare , \u201d Mr. Paul said .\nDemocrats , meanwhile , say the bill is still too much of a repeal and not enough of Obamacare . They have said they won \u2019 t cooperate until Republicans agree to keep the basic structure of the 2010 Affordable Care Act , then work on fixes .\n\u201c We live in the wealthiest country on earth . We \u2019 re proud of it as we should be . But surely , we can do better than what the Republican health care bill promises , \u201d said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer , New York Democrat .\nDemocrats also have complained about the path of the bill , which Mr. McConnell wrote and which will head straight to the floor , bypassing the extensive committee process that characterized the Obamacare debate .\nMr. McConnell promised to wait for a Congressional Budget Office evaluation of the bill and said there will be a robust floor debate , including amendments .\n\u201c It \u2019 s much better than Obamacare . I like this a lot better than the House bill , \u201d said Sen. David Perdue , Georgia Republican .\nOthers said they needed time to read the whole bill , though they felt the proposals were trending in the right direction .\nFrom the White House , President Trump said the Senate \u2019 s health care bill is in good shape but needs a \u201c little negotiation . \u201d\nThe CBO is expected to release its score next week , detailing how the bill affects federal spending and health care coverage .\nIts evaluation of the House bill , which passed that chamber last month , projected lower costs for most Americans but said the poor and those approaching retirement age would see premium hikes . Some 23 million fewer Americans would hold insurance a decade from now because Medicaid \u2019 s rolls would be cut and people would no longer be required by law to purchase insurance .\nSenators tried to lower costs for the poor and older Americans , pegging tax credits for people who buy insurance on their own to their amount of income instead of just age . That cuts a middle ground between the House plan and Obamacare .\n\u201c For example , the tax credits for older folks \u2014 people like me \u2014 are now age-adjusted and income-adjusted , so someone who is making $ 20,000 a year and 62 years old would be able to afford coverage under this , where under the [ House bill ] I think it was problematic if they could afford coverage , \u201d said Sen. Bill Cassidy , a Louisiana Republican and physician .\nThe plan also goes more slowly in curtailing Obamacare \u2019 s expansion of Medicaid , which the House plan froze in 2020 . The Senate bill would begin a gradual reduction in 2021 and return to pre-Obamacare levels in 2024 .\nTo placate fiscal hawks , the plan would allow Medicaid spending to rise at a slower rate than under the House version , starting in 2025 .\nRepublicans say reining in Medicaid spending will force states to focus on those who need it most , though moderates worry that the cuts will suddenly pull coverage from needy residents and cripple the fight against opioid addiction . The federal-state program covers 1 in 5 Americans , about half of U.S. births and two-thirds of nursing home residents .\nA number of Republicans withheld judgment , saying they will go back and talk to their governors and state health care officials and see how the bill affects them .\n\u201c At first glance , I have serious concerns about the bill \u2019 s impact on the Nevadans who depend on Medicaid , \u201d said Sen. Dean Heller , Nevada Republican and a key holdout .\nHe is considered one of the most vulnerable Republicans on an otherwise favorable Senate electoral map next year .\nAnother swing vote , Sen. Susan M. Collins of Maine , said the plan has pros and cons that deserve more scrutiny .\nThe bill would let states use Obamacare \u2019 s waiver system to drop aspects of the 2010 law , including its list of essential benefits that plans must cover . However , states can not let insurers deny people with pre-existing conditions or charge them more than healthy consumers , a concept known as \u201c community rating . \u201d\nMr. Cruz and Mr. Lee had been pushing to scrap more of the regulations on insurers , not less , and House conservatives who will revisit the final plan insisted on letting states waive community rating .\nThe bill does strip federal funding from Planned Parenthood , the country \u2019 s largest network of abortion clinics , making good on a Republican campaign pledge .\nIn a boon for insurers , Republicans said the bill would maintain through 2019 the cost-sharing payments to insurance companies that cover out-of-pocket health care expenses of the poor . Mr. Trump has threatened to withhold those payments .\nThe plan would repeal Obamacare \u2019 s taxes on health insurers , medical device makers and high earners , among others , prompting Democrats to blast it as a wealth transfer from the needy to those who are doing fine .\n\u201c Let \u2019 s be very clear : Senate Republicans are paying for tax cuts for the wealthy with American lives , \u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren , Massachusetts Democrat .\nMr. Obama also weighed in to decry the changes to his signature law .\n\u201c The Senate bill , unveiled today , is not a health care bill .
