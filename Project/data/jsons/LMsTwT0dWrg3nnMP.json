First , it would guarantee the \u201c equal right to vote \u201d by enhancing the power of the federal government to control how states conduct elections , requiring states to provide for online or automated voter registration , and shifting Election Day to a national holiday .\nSecond , it would guarantee \u201c equal representation \u201d by banning gerrymandering of districts . Lessig also endorses an idea called \u201c ranked-choice voting , \u201d where voters rank the candidates rather than vote for just one . The candidate who receives the highest aggregate ranking wins . ( You can find the somewhat complicated details here . )\nThird , it would provide for \u201c citizen-funded elections. \u201d All voters would be given vouchers that they could use to contribute to political campaigns , and small contributions would be matched from public funds . Rules blocking government officials from becoming lobbyists would be strengthened .\nWould these reforms give us \u201c citizen equality \u201d ? Unfortunately , if money goes to the root of the problem , as Lessig says , these reforms would have little impact . In the best case , they would enhance the popular vote in elections by a little bit . They might enhance by a small amount cash contributions from low-income people . And Republican-dominated state legislatures would lose some of their power to create safe seats .\nRepublican presidential candidates from left , Jim Gilmore , Lindsey Graham , Bobby Jindal , Rick Perry , Rick Santorum , Carly Fiorina , and George Pataki take the stage for a pre-debate forum .

Most Americans are terribly uninformed about the political process and rely on very crude proxies ( such as endorsements or partisan identification ) to determine how to vote .\nMany people fail to vote not because of barriers to voting but because they \u2019 d rather spend their time doing something else . Candidates who suited voters a bit better because of ranked-choice voting ( assuming it works as advertised ) and who received more small donations from low-income people would still need to rely on well-informed lobbyists with whom they had relationships and would still benefit from massive infusions of cash from big business .
