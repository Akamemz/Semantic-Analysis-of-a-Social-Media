You \u2019 re on a steep slope . \u201d\nFinton , who works for the Nature Conservancy , was pointing out something more profound than his announcement might suggest . A steep slope is a crucial element of an emerging vision to help plants and animals survive and adapt to a warming world while maintaining high levels of biological diversity .\nConservation efforts typically have focused on maintaining a pristine forest or wetland , or preserving specific species or communities of species where they are .\nYet a growing body of research shows that when you scratch the surface of a biodiverse region , you 'll generally find diverse soil types , elevation ranges , bedrock types , and features such as canyons , cliffs , ravines , and Finton \u2019 s steep slopes .\nThe new approach focuses on conserving landforms in a region that incorporate these diverse geophysical traits \u2013 which act as stages on which biological diversity thrives . And it focuses on setting up corridors between the \u201c stages \u201d to allow for species migration .\nAs the scientific evidence of global warming has mounted , conservation often has focused on finding ways to help species or communities of plants track their preferred climate conditions , where possible .
