    "content": "In its meticulous commitment to holding the Soviet Union accountable to its own laws and international treaties , A Chronicle of Current Events represented also a rebirth of civil society . It was a small community , and one that existed entirely on the onion-skin-thin pages of samizdat , the illegal , self-published writing of the dissidents , but this was where they could act as citizens , witnessing and reporting on violations of human and civil rights .\nThe Chronicle worked in a straightforward way . Issues were produced in Moscow and then passed from hand-to-hand . If someone had some piece of information to circulate , she could write it down on a slip of paper and pass it on to the person from whom she received her copy of the journal , who in turn would then keep it going along the chain . At the source were editors like Natalya Gorbanevskaya , the journal \u2019 s first \u201c compiler , \u201d as they preferred to call themselves . Eventually arrested by the state security agency , the K.G.B. , in 1969 , she was locked up in a psychiatric institution until 1972 .\nOver some 65 issues , from 1968 to 1983 , the Chronicle became a catalog of abuses , noted in the most sparse , neutral tone possible . It was a painstaking effort to publish information that could never be obtained through the official Soviet media . Here , a citizen could read the details of closed political trials and the stories of what the Chronicle called \u201c extrajudicial persecution , \u201d understand what a K.G.B . search entailed , read secret documents meant only for those in power , learn about the constant religious and cultural persecution and get updates on political prisoners in the East .\nThis was self-consciously an attempt to create a valid and verifiable news source . The Chronicle demanded that its contributors be \u201c careful and accurate \u201d with any information they passed along and even ran regular corrections to previous items ( pioneering a practice some Western media organizations only adopted years later ) . As the scholar of Soviet dissidence Peter Reddaway , writing in 1972 , put it , \u201c the Chronicle \u2019 s aim is openness , non-secretiveness , freedom of information and expression . All these notions are subsumed in the one Russian word , glasnost . \u201d\nThis was in direct opposition to the diktat the Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin had issued for newspapers , back in pre-revolutionary Russia in 1901 . The press was to be \u201c not only a collective propagandist and collective agitator , but also a collective organizer \u201d \u2014 a tool , in other words , for shoring up the power of the state . For the compiler Alexeyeva , the Chronicle represented something very different and without precedent in the Soviet Union : \u201c A source of honest information about the hidden layers of our society . \u201d\nThe K.G.B . did not take kindly to this business , and Gorbanevskaya was only the first of many editors to be arrested and imprisoned . By the 1970s , though , this fact-based evidence-gathering had become the central modus operandi of the dissidents , especially among its most prominent figures like Andrei Sakharov , the Soviet physicist who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975 . These were men and women who , in some cases , were professionally inclined toward facts \u2014 many of them were scientists , a vocation they adopted , even before they embraced dissidence , out of a conscious effort to move away from any field that could be distorted by Communist ideology .\nIn 1975 , the Soviet Union , thinking it was outsmarting the West , signed on to the Helsinki Final Act .
