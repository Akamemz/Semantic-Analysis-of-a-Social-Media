    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Sen. Al Franken apologized to the TV host and sportscaster who accused the Minnesota Democrat of kissing and groping her without her consent \u2013 and promised to cooperate with any investigation into the 2006 incident .\n`` I am asking that an ethics investigation be undertaken , and I will gladly cooperate , \u201d Franken said in a statement Thursday .\nHours earlier , Leeann Tweeden wrote an online post describing how Franken , while they were on a USO tour in the Middle East to entertain U.S. troops , `` put his hand on the back of my head , mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth . ''\nFranken is the first sitting lawmaker in Washington to be publicly accused of sexual harassment or abuse in the aftermath of the Harvey Weinstein harassment scandal that has rocked the country , though the alleged incident took place before his time in Congress .\nTweeden , who is now a morning news anchor on KABC Radio in Los Angeles , said the incident took place back stage when the two were practicing their lines for a skit written by Franken , who was then a comedian . Franken , according to Tweeden , had insisted the skit include a kiss but she did not want to go through with it .\n`` I felt disgusted and violated , '' Tweeden wrote . `` Not long after , I performed the skit as written , carefully turning my head so he couldn \u2019 t kiss me on the lips . ''\nMore : NRCC calls for Democrats to return donations from Sen. Al Franken\nMore : Senate Democrats call for ethics investigation into allegations against Sen. Al Franken\nYet she did not report what happened . In a press conference Thursday , Tweeden said , `` I just made sure I was never alone with him again\u2026What was I going to do ? Be the troublemaker ? \u201d\nTweeden also wrote that Franken groped her while she was sleeping during the flight home , which she only discovered by reviewing a photograph on a CD of images from the trip . The photo featured her asleep and Franken holding her breasts .\n`` I couldn \u2019 t believe it . He groped me , without my consent , while I was asleep , '' she wrote . `` I felt violated all over again . Embarrassed . Belittled . Humiliated . How dare anyone grab my breasts like this and think it \u2019 s funny ? ''\nSenate Majority Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , and Democratic leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y. , both called on the Senate Ethics Committee to review the allegations .\n\u201c As with all credible allegations of sexual harassment or assault , I believe the Ethics Committee should review the matter , '' McConnell said in a statement . `` Regardless of party , harassment and assault are completely unacceptable\u2014in the workplace or anywhere else . ''\nSchumer said : \u201c Sexual harassment is never acceptable and must not be tolerated . I hope and expect that the Ethics Committee will fully investigate this troubling incident , as they should with any credible allegation of sexual harassment . \u201d\nMeanwhile , the campaign arm for House Republicans called on Democrats to return any cash they received from the senator . \u201c These allegations are disgusting and Democrats who took Sen. Franken \u2019 s campaign money need to take action , \u201d National Republican Congressional Committee communications director Matt Gorman said Thursday . \u201c Return his donations and do it immediately . \u201d\nFranken apologized for both allegations after Tweeden 's account published on Thursday , apologizing to the broadcaster and `` everyone else who was part of that tour , to everyone who has worked for me , to everyone I represent , and to everyone who counts on me to be an ally and supporter and champion of women . ''\nFranken , who earlier Thursday said the photo `` was clearly intended to be funny but was n't , '' said there was \u201c no excuse \u201d for the photograph .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t know what was in my head when I took that picture , and it doesn \u2019 t matter , \u201d he said . \u201c There 's no excuse . I look at it now and I feel disgusted with myself . It isn \u2019 t funny . It \u2019 s completely inappropriate . It \u2019 s obvious how Leeann would feel violated by that picture . And what \u2019 s more , I can see how millions of other women would feel violated by it \u2013 women who have had similar experiences in their own lives , women who fear having those experiences , women who look up to me , women who have counted on me . \u201d\nThe senator also addressed Tweeden \u2019 s accusations that he had kissed her without her consen , saying while he did not \u201c remember the rehearsal for the skit as Leeann does , I understand why we need to listen to and believe women \u2019 s experiences . \u201d\nSpeaking later on CNN , Tweeden said she accepted Franken 's apologies .\nShe described his first apology from Thursday morning as `` hastily \u201d put together , but acknowledged his lengthier , follow-up statement seemed more \u201c heartfelt . \u201d\n\u201c I honestly do believe him , \u201d she said . \u201c I wasn \u2019 t waiting for an apology for him , but I gladly accept it .
