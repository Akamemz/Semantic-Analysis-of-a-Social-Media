On Friday , the biggest story about his campaign was one that declared it was \u201c running on fumes , \u201d hemorrhaging confidence from his supporters and donors just when he needs it most . As a last resort , 24 hours before the Republican primary , he dragged his 90 year old mother , Barbara , out on the campaign trail with him for three separate town hall events .\nWhat he needed was more like a 30-foot cross , and maybe a few rabbit \u2019 s feet and four leaf clovers .\nHe stood at the center of the stage , no lectern , and awkwardly dangled his stiff arms at his sides as he spoke . Thanks to his Paleo diet , he is a shell of his former self , sleek and modern in a slim-cut blazer and pants .
