He insists his officers still have discretion in every case to grant or deny amnesty , even if someone meets all the criteria for the program , known in governmentspeak as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , or DACA .\nBut his opponents say the 93 percent approval rate undercuts that argument .\n\u201c It tells me that they \u2019 re rubber-stamping DACA applications . Any program that four years after its initiation is still approving 93 percent of applicants is a program that doesn \u2019 t have very high standards , \u201d said Mark Krikorian , executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies , which advocates for an immigration crackdown .\nAlthough Dreamers were in little danger of being deported under Mr. Obama \u2019 s policies , DACA went further . It granted a proactive two-year stay of deportation , issued work permits and Social Security numbers , and made illegal immigrants eligible for some taxpayer benefits .\nThe administration began accepting DACA applications in August 2012 , in the middle of Mr. Obama \u2019 s re-election bid . In 2014 , after his party was crushed in midterm congressional elections , Mr. Obama tried to expand the amnesty to three years and making as many as 5 million illegal immigrant parents eligible .\nTexas led 25 other states in suing to stop the program , known as Deferred Action for Parental Accountability , or DAPA . Judges have halted the amnesty for parents while the case winds through courts . The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments April 18 and could issue a ruling by the end of June .\nWhile DACA is different from DAPA , the two are so closely related that the lower-court judges have used the performance of the Dreamer amnesty to inform their rulings on the broader program for parents . That \u2019 s why the DACA approval rate has become an issue .\nAt of the end of last year , nearly 715,000 people had been approved and fewer than 55,000 had been rejected . That rate is similar to the 94 percent success rate of a farmworker amnesty that was part of the 1986 amnesty . Reports said fraud within that program could have been as high as 50 percent .\nNo such widespread fraud charges have been leveled against DACA , and advocates for Dreamers say part of the reason the approval rate is so high is that the immigrants themselves have done a good job of making sure they are eligible before they apply .
