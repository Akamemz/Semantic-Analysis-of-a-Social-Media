Republican Party representatives largely kept quiet .\nDespite the criticism , President Trump launched another Twitter tirade on Monday morning , calling on the women themselves to apologise .\nThe women - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley , and Ilhan Omar , who came to the US as a refugee aged 12 - all called the president racist and were backed by members of the Democratic Party .\nMs Ocasio-Cortez was born in the Bronx in New York , approximately 12 miles away from the Queens hospital where Mr Trump was born .\nMrs May resigned as leader of the UK 's governing Conservative Party in June after being unable to get a Brexit deal through parliament . Two candidates are currently vying to replace her as prime minister .\nIn Sunday 's three-tweet thread , Mr Trump accused the congresswomen of `` viciously '' criticising him and the US .\nThe president did not explicitly name the women , but the context - and references to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - made a clear link . He said Ms Pelosi would happily organise for them to leave the country .\nA week ago , Ms Pelosi clashed with the four women - sometimes nicknamed `` the squad '' - but she has since come to their defence following his tweets .\nThe president wrote : `` So interesting to see 'progressive ' Democrat congresswomen , who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe , the worst , most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world ( if they even have a functioning government at all ) , now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States , the greatest and most powerful nation on earth , how our government is to be run .\n`` Why do n't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came . Then come back and show us how it is done .\n`` These places need your help badly , you ca n't leave fast enough . I 'm sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements ! ''\nThere have been internal feuds among Democrats over a border funding package , with Ms Pelosi arguing in favour of the package , and the four women - all newcomers to Congress with a progressive agenda - voting against .\nLast week , Ms Ocasio-Cortez accused Ms Pelosi of singling out these women of colour for criticism .\nOn Monday , Mr Trump lashed out again in two tweets .\n`` When will the Radical Left Congresswomen apologise to our country , the people of Israel and even to the office of the President , for the foul language they have used , and the terrible things they have said . So many people are angry at them and their horrible and disgusting actions , '' he said .\n`` If Democrats want to unite around the foul language and racist hatred spewed from the mouths and actions of these very unpopular and unrepresentative Congresswomen , it will be interesting to see how it plays out .
