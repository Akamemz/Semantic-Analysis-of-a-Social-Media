Beijing countered by threatening tariffs on $ 50 billion worth of U.S. farm , chemical and other exports .\nBut Mnuchin said Sunday that the two sides agreed on a framework for reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China and addressing technology trade irritants during high-level talks on Thursday and Friday , although more meetings are required to finish the deal .\n`` We 're putting the trade war on hold , '' Mnuchin said in an interview on `` Fox News Sunday . '' `` Right now , we have agreed to put tariffs on hold while we try to execute the framework . ''\nThe U.S. trade deficit with China totaled a record $ 375 billion in 2017 , and the Trump administration asked the Chinese to commit to the goal of reducing it by $ 200 billion by 2020 .\nA joint U.S.-China statement released Saturday said `` China will significantly increase purchases of United States goods and services , '' but did not specify how much more it would buy and how soon those sales would take place .\nMnuchin said he expected major purchases this year , particularly of U.S. agriculture and energy products .\n`` We are immediately going to follow this up with [ Commerce Secretary Wilbur ] Ross going there with very hard commitments in agriculture , where we expect to see a very big increase \u2014 35-40 percent increases \u2014 in agriculture this year alone , '' Mnuchin said . `` In energy , doubling the energy purchases . I think you could see $ 50 [ billion ] , $ 60 billion a year of energy purchases over the next three to five years . And strategically , that 's very important for us and very important for them .
