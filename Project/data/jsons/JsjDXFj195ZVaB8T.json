    "content": "HANOI\u2014Weeks before President Trump journeyed to Vietnam for his second summit with North Korea \u2019 s Kim Jong Un , there were unmistakable signs the historic meeting might not yield an agreement .\nThe U.S. team of diplomats , sanctions officials , nuclear experts and missile specialists taking part in working-level talks had identified a major stumbling block : North Korea expected much more in sanctions relief than the U.S. was prepared to give in exchange for only limited concessions .\nThe differences were never ironed out . Some former U.S. officials grumbled privately that the Trump-Kim meeting shouldn \u2019 t have taken place until the gaps were narrowed , which is the routine for such a high-level summit .\nEven Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday before the summit : \u201c We may not get everything done this week . \u201d\nNonetheless , both Messrs. Trump and Kim were eager to go ahead with the meeting , hoping the other would bend in the heat of their personal chemistry and under the glare of the global spotlight . Reflecting confidence , the White House announced Wednesday , a day before the formal summit meeting , that a joint agreement would be signed the following afternoon .\nThe president walked away without an agreement that would lead the way for negotiations over the U.S. \u2019 s ultimate goal of North Korea \u2019 s complete denuclearization .\nThe unconventional talks were based to a large degree on the rapport between the two leaders , and on the assumption that decisions could only be made at the highest level . Former U.S. officials with experience dealing with North Korea said the differences were too wide to bridge on the basis of personal friendship and should have been at least partly resolved before the meeting .\nWhat has become clear to U.S. officials is that there is no quick solution . Both sides say they intend to keep talking .\nThis account is based on public statements from top U.S. and North Korean officials and descriptions by participants in the talks .\nWell ahead of the Hanoi meeting , the Trump administration had eased its demands , saying it was willing to be patient . The administration raised hopes of a major advanced toward a grand bargain that would lead to specific , agreed-upon steps to strip North Korea of its nuclear arsenal and build a new relationship between the old adversaries .\nThe U.S. was no longer insisting that North Korea largely denuclearize during Mr. Trump \u2019 s current term in office . Nor was it demanding that Pyongyang provide a full accounting of its nuclear and missile programs at the start of negotiations .\nIn the months leading up the summit , North Korea demonstrated its own degree of flexibility .\nDuring a meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in September , the North Korean leader made clear that he was prepared to offer inspections at a missile-launch site , though without specifying how they would be conducted , and to potentially close some facilities at the Yongbyon nuclear complex .\nKnown and suspected sites of North Korea \u2019 s nuclear facilities Mining Education/training/research/development Weaponization/testing Nuclear power reactor Enrichment/milling/reprocessing/storage 50 miles 50 km CHINA NORTH KOREA Yongbyon nuclear facility Sea of Japan ( East Sea ) Pyongyang Seoul SOUTH KOREA\nThe 3-square-mile Yongbyon site , which contains hundreds of buildings , has been the centerpiece of North Korea \u2019 s nuclear efforts since the start of its nuclear program in the 1960s .\nIn return , North Korean officials signaled that they expected significant sanctions relief .\nStephen Biegun , U.S. special envoy for North Korea , traveled to Pyongyang for three days of meetings in February , where he met with his newly-designated counterpart , the diplomat Kim Hyok Chol .\nAbout a week before the summit , Mr. Biegun and a team of experts flew to Hanoi for marathon meetings with North Korea \u2019 s delegation , which again included Kim Hyok Chol , as well as foreign ministry officials and others .\n\u201c We were prepared to evaluate any proposal that they put forward , and we did so with great seriousness , \u201d a senior State Department official said .\nThe U.S. team struggled to close the divide between the two sides .\nAs the Americans saw it , the North Koreans were angling for the removal of all sanctions imposed by the U.N.

The sanctions prohibit trade in metals , seafood and coal , and sharply limit imports of refined and raw petroleum .\nWhen the U.S. team asked what exemptions North Korea was seeking , it seemed the answer was virtually everything , except for weapons .\nThe Americans crunched the numbers and calculated that removing the requested restrictions would be worth billions of dollars to North Korea . It turned out to be a concession the Trump administration wasn \u2019 t prepared to make in return for the shutdown of only a part of the Yongbyon complex .\nThe closure of facilities at Yongbyon that produce plutonium and highly enriched uranium used in nuclear weapons would be significant .
