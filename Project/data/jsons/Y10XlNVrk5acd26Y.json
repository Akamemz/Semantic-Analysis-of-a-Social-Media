    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will face voters on Tuesday , just two weeks after he took a major political gamble by giving a controversial speech to the U.S. Congress against the Obama administration 's wishes .\nThe White House , clearly angered by an address criticizing its Iran deal-making , denied Netanyahu an Oval Office meeting during the visit . The reason , according to an official statement , was to `` avoid the appearance of influencing a democratic election in a foreign country . ''\nSnubbing an Israeli prime minister , though , can influence Israeli voters as much as giving him a West Wing photo-op . And with U.S.-Israel tensions at a peak , many in Washington see telltale signs of an effort to oust a leader standing in the way of the Obama administration 's Middle East policies .\n`` This election cycle in Israel fits the hallmark of an American administration that seeks to influence the outcome , '' said David Weinberg , a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies who has studied American influence in Israeli elections .\nThe White House denied it was attempting to influence the Israeli elections by rebuffing Netanyahu and pointed to the well-circulated statement on why the prime minister was n't offered a meeting : `` As a matter of long-standing practice and principle , we do not see heads of state or candidates in close proximity to their elections . ''\nBut such visits -- or the lack thereof -- have historically been one of the diplomatic weapons U.S. administrations have deployed to sway the Israeli public .\nLess than a month before the 1996 Israeli elections , President Bill Clinton organized the signing of an anti-terror pact before the cameras with Shimon Peres , the Labor Party prime minister whom Netanyahu ended up defeating for his first term in office . In 1999 , Clinton similarly pursued what some call `` snub diplomacy '' when his administration denied Netanyahu meetings amidst a tight race with Labor 's Ehud Barak , to whom Netanyahu ultimately lost .\nThe state of the `` special relationship '' with the United States is of crucial importance to Israeli voters , who see America as their closest and most important ally . So in risking a rupture with the White House , Netanyahu is also risking a break with Israeli voters .\n`` Traditionally , the Israeli public has been very sensitive to how the relationship is going and how well the Israeli leadership is managing that relationship , '' said Daniel Kurtzer , a former U.S. ambassador to Israel .\nJUST WATCHED Netanyahu rails against Iran nuclear deal - in 100 seconds Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Netanyahu rails against Iran nuclear deal - in 100 seconds 01:26\nBut Netanyahu 's move to address Congress on Iran , a top concern for the Israeli public , was also seen as a bid to boost his electoral appeal by reinforcing that he is a leader on the world stage and will do everything he can to protect Israel . When Republican House Speaker John Boehner extended the invitation to Netanyahu , many jumped on the House leader for helping the prime minister politically . This week , footage of Netanyahu being warmly received on Capitol Hill made it into a campaign ad .\nThe partisan nature of the invitation and that it was done without White House coordination -- Boehner is a chief Obama rival and disagrees emphatically with his Iran policy -- heightened Democratic pique over Netanyahu 's appearance .\nPrevious presidents have bristled at the hawkish , unflinching posture -- especially when it comes to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process -- that Netanyahu and other Likud party leaders have often struck . But the current antagonism , exacerbated by the speech , has become particularly personal .\nObama himself dismissed Netanyahu 's speech as `` theater '' and slammed his Israeli counterpart for offering `` nothing new . '' And a host of officials offered further criticism , including National Security Adviser Susan Rice , who called Netanyahu 's address `` destructive '' to the U.S-Israeli relationship .\nNetanyahu 's allies deny a political motive to the speech and have maintained that the hit to U.S.-Israeli ties was necessary because of the existential danger posed by Iran and fears that negotiations on its nuclear program would lead to a disastrous agreement as they reach a key deadline .\nFormer State Department official Aaron David Miller said the Obama administration is now sending `` certain unmistakable signals '' that Netanyahu is n't the right prime minister to manage the U.S.-Israel relationship .\nMiller witnessed the sending of similar signals in 1996 as one of the top officials coordinating Arab-Israeli negotiations in the Clinton administration .\n`` We clearly had our favorites and we wanted Peres to win , '' Miller recounted .\nIt has n't just been Netanyahu whom U.S. presidents have opposed . In the run-up to the 1992 Israeli elections that eventually saw Labor 's Yitzhak Rabin elected , George H.W . Bush tied up American loan guarantees to punish the right-wing Israeli government and pressure it to change its policy on settlements .\n`` [ The idea ] that we do n't intercede in Israeli politics is as foolish an assumption as that they do n't interfere in ours , '' Miller said .\nOne of many developments seen as souring the Obama-Netanyahu relationship was the widespread accusation that the prime minister all but endorsed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in his campaign to unseat Obama in 2012 .\nBut just as Netanyahu -- if he indeed tried -- was unsuccessful in swaying that election , American presidents have also come up short .\nThere 's no clear indication right now that Netanyahu will be hurt by the U.S.-Israel row come Election Day . Netanyahu 's party saw a modest boost in one poll after Netanyahu 's speech to Congress . Several polls in recent days , however , suggest leading opposition party Zionist Union is gaining momentum in the wake of Netanyahu 's American saga .

Here's a look at other recent attempts for peace: Hide Caption 1 of 6 Photos: Defining moments in Middle East peace talks 2010 | Obama \u2013 President Barack Obama walks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, left, and President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, at the White House on September 1, 2010.

The peace conference was attended by 16 Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia and Syria, Israel and the Palestinians. A joint statement was the only thing agreed upon under heavy American pressure and by avoiding specific reference to any of the core issues.
