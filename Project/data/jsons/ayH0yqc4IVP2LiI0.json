    "content": "It 's hard to find a voice on the left willing to speak up for the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal . Unions are freezing donations to Democrats in protest of it . Elizabeth Warren is fighting it . Robert Reich is campaigning against it , as is Joseph Stiglitz . Paul Krugman is a soft no , and he wonders : `` Why , exactly , should the Obama administration spend any political capital \u2014 alienating labor , disillusioning progressive activists \u2014 over such a deal ? ''\nI 'm currently in the undecided camp \u2014 until there 's a final text I can run by experts , it 's hard to say anything definitive \u2014 but in recent weeks , I 've asked a version of Krugman 's question to a number of Obama administration officials intimately involved in crafting the deal : why are they so committed to this agreement , and why are they having so much trouble selling their usual allies on it ?\n1 . The first thing the administration says is that this is a good deal : when the text is finalized and released publicly , people will be surprised by how different from its predecessors this trade deal really is . They note that Obama ran for office promising to renegotiate NAFTA , and while that did n't happen , this deal fully reflects his thinking about what went wrong with NAFTA \u2014 particularly in the weak enforceability of its labor and environmental standards .\n2 . The need to wait for the text to be finalized has created an asymmetry between critics and supporters : opponents of the agreement can oppose it now , but for the most part potential supporters want to wait for the agreement to be done to back it , as they need to make sure the language they like does n't change . There are some exceptions to this rule \u2014 a letter from a gaggle of top economists from past White Houses , for instance \u2014 but overall , the administration thinks it 's just in a hard position until there 's a final document to show .\n3 . That said , the unions really do know a lot about what 's in this deal . And they still oppose it . Pressed on this , the White House 's answer is one that liberals have heard from the Obama administration before , and that they never fail to find frustrating : TPP may not be perfect , but it 's a lot better than the alternative .\n4 . In this case , there really is an alternative . The past major trade deals largely predated the rise of China . But TPP is happening even as China pushes its own trade deal : one with much weaker labor and environmental standards . As Larry Summers writes , `` The TPP should be judged not against the hypothetical past in which U.S. workers did not face foreign competition but in the context of a world in which trade integration in Asia is already happening \u2014 with or without the United States . ''\n5 . Here 's how the White House sees it : there will either be a trade deal with America at the core of it that forces countries like Vietnam and Malaysia to live up to labor and environmental standards the Obama administration finds acceptable , or there will be a trade deal with China at the core of it that forces countries like Vietnam and Malaysia to live up to labor and environmental standards China finds acceptable . Which would you prefer ?\n6 . There 's also a bigger foreign policy objective here . TPP is central to the Obama administration 's long-heralded `` pivot to Asia . '' Trade deals tend to get coded as economic policy rather than foreign policy , but the Obama administration sees that as a function of the Cold War and the post-9/11 era militarizing foreign policy . Americans need to realize that the competition with China , etc. , will be about using economic policy as an effective tool of statecraft .\n7 . This is , the Obama administration thinks , a `` put up or shut up '' moment for America . We talk a big game about wanting to be the global leader and fearing that China , with its autocratic government and abysmal labor and environmental standards , will supersede our influence in other developing countries . But if we 're going to stop that , we need our leadership to be more than talk . If America 's trade deal collapses while China 's succeeds , it will convince a lot of these countries that America 's political system does n't work smoothly enough to provide the kind of leadership we once did .\n8 . One really important dimension of the debate around TPP is intellectual property protections . This is an area where American businesses feel hugely disadvantaged overseas , and the administration thinks it 's giving them a big win . But there are economists \u2014 Krugman is one \u2014 who think IP protections have already gone too far , and even if it gives Paramount or Pfizer a bit more protection , the result will be to make the world poorer without obviously making American workers much richer .\nFor the record , I do n't know yet whether TPP is a good deal . I have n't seen final text , much less had a chance to run it by experts . Both sides are mostly arguing the big picture around trade , intellectual property , and the like , but trade deals are heavily about details . And we just do n't know all the details yet .\nOn this , I agree with Brad DeLong , who writes , `` It is foolish to debate whether a trade agreement that has not yet been negotiated is a good idea and should be ratified . Such a debate should properly begin only once there is something to analyze . '' That said , DeLong goes on to explain why he supports the basic outlines of the TPP , so I 'll make a few broad points , as well .\nI 'm skeptical of the sheer size of modern trade deals and the opaque process that creates them . The negotiation process is n't quite as secretive as some think \u2014 the congressional briefings are constant , and the advisory committees are sprawling \u2014 but it is insanely complex .\nThe result is that even where there is transparency , it 's a form of transparency that can only really be navigated by politically sophisticated , highly motivated actors \u2014 which is to say it 's a form of transparency that quickly becomes a venue for lobbying . That 's one reason these deals end up including so much ... stuff . The process is constructed in such a way that the negotiators get a lot of special pleading from individual industries and interests . Responding to those requests feels like responding to the public , but it is n't , and it leads to deals jam-packed with individual provisions that look a lot like giveaways .\nBut I also think the context of a trade deal like TPP is very different from the context of a trade deal like NAFTA . David Autor , an economist who has done some of the seminal work on the way trade has harmed America 's middle class , coauthored a piece in the Washington Post that makes the point well : the costs of trade have come in America 's manufacturing sector , and those jobs are n't coming back . What 's more salient for the American economy is labor and environmental standards elsewhere , IP protections ( which I very much worry will be taken too far ) , customs and border questions , etc . There are real gains to America to getting these rules right .\nAnother way to put this is the global trade regime is oriented toward physical industries America has lost , rather than information industries where America leads .
