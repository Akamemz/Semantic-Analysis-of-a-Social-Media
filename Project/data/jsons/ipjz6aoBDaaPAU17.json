Trump said he was \u201c very happy and impressed \u201d with the vote , which saw both China and Russia side against Pyongyang in the wake of a test which experts said meant North Korea could now potentially reach the continental United States .\nVice-President Mike Pence has walked a tightrope few others in the White House have managed during the seven months of Trump \u2019 s presidency : keeping himself out of the jaws of the Russia inquiry \u2013 despite questions over what he knew about the fired national security adviser Michael Flynn \u2013 and out of the line of fire of his boss \u2019 s Twitter account .\nSo far , anyway . On Sunday , Pence was forced to push back forcefully against a New York Times article suggesting he is preparing for a presidential run in 2020 , calling it \u201c disgraceful \u201d , \u201c offensive \u201d and \u201c categorically false \u201d in a statement many saw as largely directed towards one reader : the man currently on vacation at his golf club in Bedminster , New Jersey . Sorry , my mistake \u2013 as Trump tweeted on Saturday : \u201c This is not a vacation \u2013 meetings and calls ! \u201d\nNorth Korea reacted badly to the UN sanctions , vowing to exact a \u201c thousand-fold \u201d revenge on the US and threatening to take \u201c righteous action \u201d in response . \u201c There is no bigger mistake than the United States believing that its land is safe across the ocean , \u201d the KCNA state news agency said .\nElsewhere , \u2588\u2588\u2588 revealed that two congressional staffers had travelled to London last month to contact Christopher Steele , the former British intelligence officer behind the infamous unconfirmed Trump dossier , on the orders of an aide to Devin Nunes , the chairman of the House intelligence committee and a close ally of the White House . The committee is investigating links between Trump and Russia and the revelation shone a light on the power struggle for control of the inquiry .\nTensions with North Korea continued to rise , with Japan warning that Pyongyang may now have the acquired the ability to miniaturise nuclear warheads \u2013 necessary if it wants to use its new intercontinental ballistic missiles for a nuclear strike on the US . That warning was followed by a story in the Washington Post stating that US intelligence agencies believed the same thing .\nThat development appeared to prompt a startlingly bellicose response from Trump , who told journalists at his Bedminster golf club : \u201c North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States . They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen . \u201d\nAs experts warned that such bombastic threats could lead Kim Jong-un to overreact , North Korea said it was \u201c carefully examining \u201d a plan for a missile strike on the US Pacific territory of Guam \u2013 home to significant US naval and air bases \u2013 and could carry out a pre-emptive operation if the US showed signs of \u201c provocation \u201d .\nIn domestic news , at an event billed as a \u201c major briefing \u201d on the US opioid crisis , the president rebuffed a call from his commission on the subject to declare the situation a national emergency , and focused instead on harsher sentences and policing the Mexican border , without mentioning the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture many addictive painkillers such as Vicodin and OxyContin within the US . The health secretary , Tom Price , said the administration did not think it was necessary to declare an emergency \u201c although all things are on the table for the president \u201d . Critics claimed the president was stuck in a 1980s view of how to tackle drug abuse .\nDefying Trump \u2019 s pledge to respond militarily to any more threats from North Korea , Pyongyang set out a detailed plan to attack Guam , with Gen Kim Rak-gyom , the head of the country \u2019 s strategic forces , outlining a demonstration launch of four intermediate-range missiles that would fly over Japan and then land in the sea around the US territory , \u201c enveloping \u201d the island .\nThe statement said the plan for this show of force would be ready by the middle of this month and then await orders from Kim . Trump \u2019 s comments , it said , were a \u201c load of nonsense \u201d and the president himself was \u201c a guy bereft of reason \u2026 only absolute force can work on him \u201d .\nIn Russia news , it emerged that the FBI used a search warrant to raid the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort \u2019 s home late last month \u2013 indicating agents are likely to have had probable cause to believe Manafort might not comply with a subpoena request to hand over all relevant records .\nAddressing reporters at Bedminster at two wide ranging Q & A sessions on Thursday , Trump warned Kim that if \u201c he does something in Guam , it will be an event the likes of which nobody \u2019 s seen before , what will happen in North Korea \u201d and mused that his \u201c fire and fury \u201d statement of earlier in the week may not have been tough enough . He would not rule out a pre-emptive strike , but also said he would consider negotiations .\nThe president also seemed to reverse course on the opioid epidemic , saying : \u201c We \u2019 re going to draw it up and we \u2019 re going to make it a national emergency. \u201d It was not immediately clear whether this would lead to a formal declaration , something that would empower the government to quickly expand access to in-patient treatment services and negotiate lower prices for the overdose reversal drug naloxone .\nIn stark contrast to his condemnation of US sanctions against Russia last week , Trump praised Russia \u2019 s sanctions against the US , saying it was good Vladimir Putin had ordered the US to cut 755 diplomatic staff in Russia because \u201c we \u2019 re trying to cut down our payroll and as far as I \u2019 m concerned , I \u2019 m very thankful that he let go of a large number of people because now we have a smaller payroll \u201d .\nWhile continuing to deny collusion with Russia over what US intelligence says was Moscow \u2019 s attempt to swing the election in his favour last year , Trump seemed to acknowledge that some of his staff might have broken rules regarding their meetings with Russians . \u201c Did they do something wrong because they didn \u2019 t file the right document or whatever ? \u201d he asked . \u201c Perhaps , you \u2019 d have to look at them , but I guarantee you this , there are probably a lot of people in Washington who did the same thing. \u201d As for Manafort , the raid on his house was \u201c pretty tough stuff \u201d , the president said .\nA study found that the uncertainty triggered by the Trump administration \u2019 s statements and actions regarding the future of Barack Obama \u2019 s healthcare reforms is triggering double-digit premium increases on individual health insurance policies purchased by many consumers .
