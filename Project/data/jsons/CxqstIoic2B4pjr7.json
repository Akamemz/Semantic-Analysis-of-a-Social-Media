    "content": "Elizabeth Warren has become a progressive icon over the last decade . She was the intellectual force behind the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , and she was a prominent early voice pushing to move the Democratic Party in a more leftward direction . Although she does not claim the socialist label for herself , she is in many ways the forerunner of the resurgent democratic socialist movement and its champions , from Bernie Sanders to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez .\nBut precisely because she has been so successful at pushing her party and its voter base to the left , she now faces political competition . In response , Warren is carving out a unique niche for herself : While her competitors are increasingly focused on dramatically increasing federal spending with ideas like Medicare for All and free public college tuition , Warren is focused on corporate regulation and oversight .\nIt 's a savvy move from one of the left 's most effective political strategists . It also has the potential to be far more dangerous and disruptive than conventional tax-and-spend progressivism .\nOver the last two weeks , Warren has rolled out a pair of legislative proposals designed to change the way corporate governance is regulated . This week 's entry was an anti-corruption plan that would impose restrictions on how soon government officials can become lobbyists after leaving office and would require the IRS to release presidential candidates ' tax returns . Some of its provisions are worthwhile ; some are n't . Much of it is targeted at President Trump .\nThe more significant of the two is the Accountable Capitalism Act , which would radically overhaul corporate governance at large companies .\nCurrently , corporate charters are granted at the state level , but Warren 's plan would force corporations with more than $ 1 billion in annual revenue to obtain a federal charter from a new Office of United States Corporations within the Department of Commerce . Those companies would be subject to a variety of rules , including a mandate that at least 40 percent of the board of directors be elected by employees , an instruction to consider all `` stakeholders '' ( not just shareholders ) when making business decisions , and a requirement that 75 percent of both shareholders and board members approve of any political activity .\nIn a Wall Street Journal op-ed announcing the plan , Warren wrote that since 1985 , shareholders `` extracted almost $ 7 trillion '' from U.S. companies . `` That 's trillions of dollars in profits that might otherwise have been reinvested in the workers who helped produce them . '' The clear implication is that corporate profits and shareholder returns represent a pot of money that can be tapped for redistribution without raising taxes or increasing government spending . Media accounts of Warren 's plan have been even more explicit about this . A write-up in Fast Company , for example , said that `` the Accountable Capitalism Act could precipitate the shift of trillions of dollars in wealth from the top 10 % to the struggling middle and lower classes , without requiring any federal spending . ''\nAlthough Warren has not explicitly framed her proposal in opposition to spending-heavy agenda of Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez , it 's impossible to avoid the contrast . The essential components of the democratic socialist agenda\u2014single-payer health care , free tuition at public colleges , a jobs guarantee\u2014would add tens of trillions of dollars to the federal budget , even according to accounting from neutral and left-leaning sources .
