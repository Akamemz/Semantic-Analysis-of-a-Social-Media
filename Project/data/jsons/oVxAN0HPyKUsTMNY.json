One of the most plausible is that Baghdadi is a much harder target , whereas the nature of the No . 2 job involves exposing oneself to greater risk of being targeted .\nAs a leader , Baghdadi serves as ISIS 's chief executive and ideological head . He does n't have to move around all that much or actually go out in the field ; his job mostly involves issuing orders and , on occasion , making propaganda tapes .\nThat means he can sit wherever he 's hiding out , avoiding the kind of contact with the outside world that makes it easier for US intelligence agencies to find you .\nKilling the group 's No . 2 is n't actually all that consequential\nHowever , not every ISIS leader has the luxury of doing that . Baghdadi 's top subordinates , the ones he gives orders to , have to go out in the field and run ISIS operations .
