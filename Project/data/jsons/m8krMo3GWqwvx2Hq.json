    "content": "A recent draft of the Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade deal would give U.S. pharmaceutical firms unprecedented protections against competition from cheaper generic drugs , possibly transcending the patent protections in U.S. law .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 has obtained a draft copy of TPP \u2019 s intellectual property chapter as it stood on May 11 , at the start of the latest negotiating round in Guam . While U.S. trade officials would not confirm the authenticity of the document , they downplayed its importance , emphasizing that the terms of the deal are likely to change significantly as the talks enter their final stages . Those terms are still secret , but the public will get to see them once the twelve TPP nations reach a final agreement and President Obama seeks congressional approval .\nStill , the draft chapter will provide ammunition for critics who have warned that TPP \u2019 s protections for pharmaceutical companies could dump trillions of dollars of additional health care costs on patients , businesses and governments around the Pacific Rim . The highly technical 90-page document , cluttered with objections from other TPP nations , shows that U.S. negotiators have fought aggressively and , at least until Guam , successfully on behalf of Big Pharma .\nThe draft text includes provisions that could make it extremely tough for generics to challenge brand-name pharmaceuticals abroad . Those provisions could also help block copycats from selling cheaper versions of the expensive cutting-edge drugs known as \u201c biologics \u201d inside the U.S. , restricting treatment for American patients while jacking up Medicare and Medicaid costs for American taxpayers .\n\u201c There \u2019 s very little distance between what Pharma wants and what the U.S. is demanding , \u201d said Rohit Malpini , director of policy for Doctors Without Borders .\nThroughout the TPP talks , the Obama administration has pledged to balance the goals of fostering innovation in the drug industry , which means allowing higher profits , and promoting wider access to valuable medicines , which means keeping prices down . U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman has pointed out that pharmaceutical companies often have to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to get a new drug to market , which they would have little incentive to do without strong protections for the patented product . But Froman has also recognized the value of allowing much cheaper generic drugs to enter the market after those brand-name patents expire . In the U.S. , generics now comprise more than five-sixths of all prescription drugs , but only about one-quarter of drug costs .\nAdvocates for the global poor , senior citizens , labor unions and consumers as well as the generics industry have accused the administration of abandoning that balance , pushing a pharmaceutical-company agenda at the expense of patients and taxpayers . One critic , hoping to illustrate the point and rally opposition to TPP in Congress , gave \u2588\u2588\u2588 the draft chapter , which was labeled \u201c This Document Contains TPP CONFIDENTIAL Information \u201d on every page .\nU.S. officials said the key point to remember about trade deals is that no provision is ever final until the entire deal is final\u2014and that major compromises tend to happen at the very end of the negotiations .

Striking this important balance is at the heart of our work . \u201d\nThe draft chapter covers software , music and other intellectual property issues as well , but its most controversial language involves the rights of drug companies . The text reveals disputes between the U.S. ( often with support from Japan ) and its TPP partners over a variety of issues\u2014what patents can cover , when and how long they can be extended , how long pharmaceutical companies can keep their clinical data private , and much more . On every issue , the U.S. sided with drug companies in favor of stricter intellectual property protections .\nSome of the most contentious provisions involve \u201c patent linkage , \u201d which would prevent regulators in TPP nations from approving generic drugs whenever there are any unresolved patent issues . The TPP draft would make this linkage mandatory , which could help drug companies fend off generics just by claiming an infringement . The Obama administration often describes TPP as the most progressive free-trade deal in history , citing its compliance with the tough labor and environment protections enshrined in the so-called \u201c May 10 Agreement \u201d of 2007 , which set a framework for several trade deals at the time .
