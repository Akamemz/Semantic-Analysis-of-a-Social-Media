    "content": "President Donald Trump says Seattle \u2019 s Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone , a largely police-free community space fashioned amid protests , is run by \u201c domestic terrorists. \u201d Seattle \u2019 s police department made ( and walked back ) a claim about anarchists \u201c extorting \u201d businesses in the area .\nBut actual businesses around the zone say they \u2019 re watching Ava DuVernay films , handing out granola bars , and having a nice time .\nFollowing several nights of showdowns between police and protesters , in which cops made liberal use of tear gas and flash grenades , Seattle reached a detente with activists on June 9 . The city would open up a few streets for Black Lives Matter marches in its Capitol Hill neighborhood , and police would evacuate the nearby precinct . With police mostly gone , activists\u2014including a mix of Black Lives Matter organizers , anarchists , and the two groups \u2019 overlap\u2014set up barricades around several blocks and proceeded to turn the interior into a sort of cop-free commune . Local businesses are chipping in with free food and open bathrooms , despite rumors that activists were holding them prisoner in their own beer halls and indie movie theaters .\nBut the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone , or CHAZ as it quickly became known , has inevitably became the focus of conservative hand-wringing . \u201c Domestic Terrorists have taken over Seattle , \u201d Trump tweeted late Wednesday , alongside a demand that state and local officials \u201c take back your city NOW . If you don \u2019 t do it , I will . This is not a game . These ugly Anarchists must be stopped IMMEDIATELY . MOVE FAST ! \u201d The president has continued to inveigh about the allegedly dangerous project underway there .\nSeattle Police circulated their own talking points about the CHAZ . \u201c We \u2019 ve heard , anecdotally , reports of citizens and businesses being asked to pay a fee to operate within this area , \u201d Assistant Chief of Police Deanna Nollette said on Wednesday . \u201c This is the crime of extortion . If anyone has been subjected to this , we need them to call 911 . \u201d\nNot only is that not true , local business owner Gay Gilmore told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 , but some businesses are actually opening to protesters for the first time after long closures for COVID-19 .\nRumors that \u201c businesses have actually been tithed or taxed by the autonomous zone [ are ] absurd , \u201d said Gilmore , who co-owns the Optimism Brewing Company with her husband . \u201c No one is doing that there . I have no idea where that idea came from and I 'm in contact with lots of the businesses who are in this neighborhood . \u201d\n\u201c GSBA and Capitol Hill Business Alliance have also reached out to businesses in the area , and we have found no evidence of this occurring , \u201d the Greater Seattle Business Association tweeted on Thursday .\nThe few concrete claims of discomfort stem from a Seattle Post-Intelligencer article that cites unnamed businesses worried about safety , and reports of at least one person carrying a gun on the scene . ( Washington is an open-carry state , although Seattle banned weapons in an emergency order on May 30 . )\nThe Seattle Times traced the extortion rumors to a fringe Canadian blog that focuses almost pathologically on overheated fears about leftist activists . That article cited unnamed police sources , who allegedly claimed businesses were being extorted . Those claims spread quickly through the right-wing media sphere , until police repeated them on Wednesday , prompting more articles and completing the ouroboros of extortion rumors .\nThe department appeared to backtrack on those claims Thursday , stating its \u201c anecdotal \u201d reports had come from media and social media .\n\u201c That has not happened affirmatively , \u201d Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best said during the Thursday evening press conference . \u201c We have n't had any formal reports of this occurring . \u201d\nThe zone \u2019 s Northwest Film Forum , Northwest Liquor and Wine , and Pel Meni Dumpling Tzar all told Seattle \u2019 s Q13 FOX News that businesses were not being extorted .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve been talking with neighboring businesses and they \u2019 re all elated honestly , \u201d a Pel Meni employee told the station . Some businesses told the Seattle Times that their sales had actually improved , since people were placing walk-up orders that didn \u2019 t require delivery fees .\n\u201c This protest has not hurt us at all , \u201d Brian O'Connor , co-owner of the zone \u2019 s Bok a Bok Chicken told the paper , adding that someone gave him a free sandwich when he entered the CHAZ .\nMx . Pucks A \u2019 Plenty , a local activist and performer who asked to speak under their performance name , said Capitol Hill is a historically Black and queer neighborhood , and that that history informs locals \u2019 interactions with the CHAZ .\n\u201c The people of Capitol Hill have been extremely giving , \u201d Pucks told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c They have helped provide supplies . They have helped take care of people when they were tear gassed . They had their phones turned on to the police and made sure that people of the world were watching what 's happening here in Seattle . And so I think a portion of what we were seeing on , on the Hill right now is this desire to give back to a community that really did support what was happening in it . \u201d\nRancho Bravo , a restaurant in the CHAZ , was hosting a medical tent\u2014even after its trash cans were damaged in the protests , Pucks said . \u201c You have restaurants in the area making food and delivering it to people on the frontline , \u201d they added . \u201c You have the Vermilion [ an art gallery and bar ] , which was storing supplies , giving out supplies . \u201d\nOptimism\u2014a large beer hall located just outside the barricaded area\u2014has been closed for months as COVID-19 swept the country .\n\u201c The business is in debt , \u201d Gilmore said , adding that they were opening a proper reopening in a few weeks . Even so , she and her colleagues agreed to open the beer hall \u2019 s bathrooms for protesters , after seeing them line up for a pair of port-a-potties on the street . \u201c It was the one thing that we could do was to open the bathrooms . \u201d\nHer staff has even been volunteering and using the hall \u2019 s long tables to collect donations for CHAZ-dwellers , she added .\n\u201c I 'm looking at three huge tables covered in water bottles and toilet paper rolls and tampons and bandaids and markers to make signs and granola bars and oranges and bananas , \u201d Gilmore said .\nCHAZ activists have used those donations to assemble bags of food for the homeless , part of an organic activism program that also includes teach-ins on racial justice and movie screenings at night .
