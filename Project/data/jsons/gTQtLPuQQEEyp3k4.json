    "content": "President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are not the only world leaders facing political backlash as governments scramble to contain the vicious COVID-19 virus .\nPressure is mounting for world leaders to contain the spread of the virus , even as outbreaks threaten the economy as well . Opposition parties and ordinary citizens are beginning to question whether their governments can properly handle the growing crisis .\nConservative populists in Europe such as Italy \u2019 s Matteo Salvini and France \u2019 s Marine Le Pen have tied their critiques to their signature issue of immigration and are slamming government officials for what they say is a failure to recognize the real threat .\n\u201c Allowing the migrants to land from Africa , where the presence of the virus was confirmed , is irresponsible , \u201d Mr. Salvini , the onetime interior minister who is now a harsh critic of the government of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte , told reporters in Genoa this week . Mr. Conte , he said , should resign \u201c if he isn \u2019 t able to defend Italy and Italians . \u201d\nOfficials from the World Health Organization insisted during a press briefing Tuesday that countries must be prepared to wage a \u201c full-on assault \u201d to curb the spread of the coronavirus . WHO officials declared this week that the spread of COVID-19 is on the cusp of a global pandemic .\n\u201c Think [ as if ] it \u2019 s going to be there tomorrow \u2026 , \u201d WHO official Bruce Aylward said in a press briefing . \u201c I keep hearing , \u2018 Oh , if it hits us we just have to accept it and it \u2019 s going to spread. \u2019 Why ? You \u2019 ve lost before you \u2019 ve started . \u201d\nGovernments across Asia are already on the defensive over their early responses to the virus .\nAs the outbreak in South Korea worsens , President Moon Jae-in faces growing criticism that he has taken the spread of the virus too lightly . The number of infections in South Korea rose to more than 1,200 Wednesday , making it the second most affected country after China .\nMr . Moon recently visited the city of Daegu , the center of the outbreak in his country , and called the situation \u201c very grave. \u201d The virus is believed to have started in the obscure Shincheonji Church of Jesus , whose membership includes 9,000 people now in quarantine . As Mr. Moon \u2019 s administration scrambles to contain the virus by screening tens of thousands of people daily , critics say the president did not act swiftly enough in the critical early days of the emergency .\n\u201c The coronavirus situation spun out of control as the president was mired in optimism , saying that the outbreak wouldn \u2019 t last long , \u201d the conservative Chosun Ilbo newspaper , a frequent Moon critic , said in an editorial . \u201c If we can \u2019 t block the virus , the whole country will be in danger . \u201d\nOpposition politician Kim Seung-dong organized a public protest in the streets of Daegu on Friday . He said in a post on Facebook that Mr. Moon \u2019 s administration \u201c failed to respond early to the coronavirus. \u201d Mr. Kim now says people are dying of \u201c Moon Jae-in virus , \u201d Time magazine reported .\nAn online petition with more than 760,000 signatures on a website linked to the presidential office demands that the Moon government consider a travel ban on visitors from China . Officials in Hong Kong and Israel have instituted blanket bans on South Korean travelers , but Mr. Moon \u2019 s administration has balked at a total prohibition on the entry of Chinese citizens .\nJapanese President Shinzo Abe is also facing heat after reports that he delegated much of the responsibility for crisis control to Health Minister Katsunobu Kato . Mr. Abe was seen as largely silent throughout the nightmarish ordeal of the Diamond Princess cruise ship , which left nearly 700 people infected and trapped aboard the quarantined ship in a Japanese port for weeks .\n\u201c Where is the leadership ? \u201d former Columbia University professor Gerry Curtis remarked to Reuters . \u201c Even now , he \u2019 s not out there , not talking to the public and mobilizing people . I think this will hurt him the longer this goes on . \u201d\nThe infections in Japan , which totaled nearly 160 through Tuesday , has cast a cloud of uncertainty over the Summer Olympics set to kick off in Tokyo in July . Critics say Mr. Abe may have underplayed the coronavirus crisis and delayed prevention and detection moves for fear it would endanger the success of the 2020 Games .\nThe Japanese economy took a big hit in December because of a rise in the sales tax , and critics speculate that Mr. Abe \u2019 s administration could be resisting an outright ban of all Chinese travelers to the country in hopes that tourism will give the economy a much-needed boost .\nIn Thailand , authoritarian Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha and his aides have been mocked and criticized for what critics say has been a series of confusing , contradictory statements on the public health threat .\nMr. Prayuth and other officials initially were accused of downplaying the crisis as they rejected demands to stop incoming flights from China or end special visa privileges for Chinese visitors .\nLike Japan , Thailand \u2019 s economy is heavily dependent on Chinese visitors , Chinese investment and Chinese markets .\nOpposition parties have accused the government of using the coronavirus as an excuse to ban large gatherings and stifle political dissent .\nMr. Prayuth responded by suggesting that anyone who \u201c politicizes \u201d the government \u2019 s response could be imprisoned .\nPublic Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul , who is not a doctor , received heavy criticism this month when he criticized \u201c those damn Caucasian tourists \u201d who , he said , were refusing to wear the medical face masks that Thai officials are distributing .\n\u201c They need to be kicked out of Thailand , \u201d Mr. Anutin told reporters .\nIn neighboring Cambodia , longtime Prime Minister Hun Sen is also under scrutiny for his full-throated support of China and his refusal to follow the lead of other countries in restricting Chinese visitors .\nHun Sen was one of the first foreign leaders to travel to Beijing in support of Mr. Xi as the crisis was unfolding and later allowed the MS Westerdam cruise ship to dock at Sihanoukville despite fears that the passengers and crew could be infected with the highly contagious virus . Critics said Cambodia \u2019 s authoritarian leader was more concerned with preserving China \u2019 s economic and diplomatic support than with protecting his people from the virus .\nCambodia \u2019 s domestic press is tightly controlled , but the government has lashed out at foreign media outlets that it says have distorted the country \u2019 s response to the health crisis .\n\u201c Such hasty , unsubstantiated , unprofessional and accusatory articles and statements have spurred unnecessary fears and confusion among the public regarding the spread of the coronavirus , \u201d Cambodia \u2019 s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation said in a statement last week .\nMore than a half-dozen European countries have reported cases of COVID-19 .
