    "content": "A decade ago , 80 percent of Americans believed that a free market economy was the best economic system . Today , that number is 60 percent . Another recent poll shows that only 42 percent of millennials support capitalism .\nSo what happened ? Why have so many people , both in the US and abroad , lost faith in capitalism ?\nSteven Pearlstein , a columnist for the Washington Post and public affairs professor at George Mason University , has a few answers . The primary reason is that the system has become too unstable : Wages are largely stagnant , and the income gap is so wide that the rich and the poor effectively live in different worlds . No surprise , then , that people are unhappy with the status quo .\nPearlstein \u2019 s new book , Can American Capitalism Survive ? , chronicles the excesses of capitalism and shows how its ethical foundations have been shattered by a radical free market ideology \u2014 often referred to as \u201c neoliberalism. \u201d Capitalism isn \u2019 t dead , Pearlstein argues , but it has to be saved from itself before it \u2019 s too late .\nI spoke to him about how we might do that , whether capitalism is even worth salvaging at this point , and why he thinks America needs a new social contract between business and society .\nThe most obvious answer is that capitalism has left a lot of people behind in the last 30 years . Everyone can see that the top 1 percent , the top 10 percent , the top 20 percent , have captured most of the benefits of economic growth over the last 30 years , and the rest of the population has been marginalized .\nNow , we all know this , but I wrote the book because I think there is a feeling even among those of us who didn \u2019 t get left behind that this system has become too unfair , too ruthless , and rewards too many of the things we think of as bad . The system offends the moral sensibilities even of people who are benefiting from it .\nI \u2019 m not so sure that the people at the top are starting to see it that way , but we \u2019 ll come back to that . First , tell me what went wrong in the 1970s and \u2019 80s , when you say capitalism really started to go sideways .\nTwo things happened during the \u2019 70s and \u2019 80s . First , the American industrial economy lost its competitiveness . Neoliberal policies of global free trade and unregulated markets were embraced , and the US was suddenly facing competition from all over the globe .\nSo American companies , which had been so dominant in our own market and in foreign markets , started to lose their dominance , and they had to get leaner and meaner . They started behaving in different ways . They started sharing less profits with their employees and with shareholders and customers .\nEventually , that produced a revolt from shareholders , and in the mid- \u2019 80s we had the first of what were called \u201c hostile takeovers , \u201d in which people would come in and buy up large chunks of companies and threaten to take them over or out the executives if they didn \u2019 t put shareholders above all else .\nThe result of all this was that companies changed how they did business and completely embraced the idea that companies should be run to maximize shareholder value and nothing else . Obviously , that meant more money for executives and shareholders and less money for employees and customers .\nThis is the mentality that led us to the place we \u2019 re in now .\n\u201c This is not a sustainable system , and if it keeps getting worse , we run the risk of a revolution \u201d\nI want to push you on what I think is an excessively sanguine view of capitalism . In the book , you imply that capitalism has gone off the rails , but I disagree . I \u2019 d argue that capitalism has evolved in precisely the way we should have expected it to evolve . The culture of norms and values that were supposed to check the excesses of capitalism has ( predictably ) been eroded by capitalism itself , and now it \u2019 s propelled entirely by greed .\nYou seem to think that capitalism can be saved from itself . What do you say to people who think it \u2019 s not salvageable , not morally legitimate , and in any case not worth salvaging ?\nThe question is , is all of that endemic to capitalism ? I don \u2019 t think so , because we see different kinds of capitalism in countries in , say , Northern Europe and in Germany . Some of that has to do with the rules and laws under which they operate , but a lot of it has to do with the norms of behavior . So capitalism doesn \u2019 t have to reach the point of ruthlessness like it has here and other places .\nAnd one of the good things about capitalism is that it has self-correcting mechanisms , just as democracy has self-correcting mechanisms . The truth is that the outcome we have now , all of this tremendous inequality , is bad morally and economically . This is not a sustainable system , and if it keeps getting worse , we run the risk of a revolution .\nSo I don \u2019 t think capitalism is an inherently moral system or an inherently self-defeating system , but we have to ensure that it adapts when it veers too far into corruption and inequality . And that \u2019 s basically what I \u2019 m calling for in this book .\nWell , yes , capitalist systems are extremely adaptable ( that \u2019 s definitely one thing Karl Marx got really , really wrong ) , but the problem is that our system isn \u2019 t adapting , or not adapting fast enough . And we live in a media culture in which nearly half the population is fed propaganda that convinces them that immigrants and regulations are what are holding them back , not greedy corporations .\nHow do we course-correct in the face of all this confusion ?\nWe do it by changing norms , and by talking about it and discussing it . That \u2019 s how a democracy goes about it . Now one of the questions you might ask is , how do norms change ? And the answer is , I don \u2019 t know .\nBut in the # MeToo movement , we see a very good example of how norms can change very quickly . What was acceptable five years ago is really not acceptable anymore . And it \u2019 s because enough people got morally outraged and things changed . That \u2019 s how norms shift and the culture evolves .\nI \u2019 ll circle back to the # MeToo comparison because I think it \u2019 s a bad one , but there are also legal and structural impediments here . We have a political system fueled by private money , which means that wealth translates to political influence , which in turn means the laws are increasingly rigged to benefit the people on top .\nYou make a very good point , and in the book I say the No . 1 thing we have to do is get money out of politics \u2014 and that will probably require a constitutional amendment . But you \u2019 re right : We can \u2019 t reform our economic system if we don \u2019 t reform our political financing system .\nAs it is now , we \u2019 re stuck in a vicious cycle in which concentration of wealth leads to concentration of political power , which leads to yet more concentration of wealth . And we know how this plays out in the long run \u2014 it leads to revolution . But we don \u2019 t have to get anywhere near that if we can make the changes we need to make now .\nThe Democratic Party will have to lead the way , and if they really want to do that , they need to put this at the top of their agenda and run on it . People out there are angry , and this will help them win . It \u2019 s a slam-dunk issue , really . People are as disgusted by what they \u2019 re seeing as you and I are .\nI want to quote something interesting from your book : \u201c Liberal critics never miss an opportunity to complain about the level of inequality , but they \u2019 ve rarely been willing to say what level , or what kinds , of inequality would be morally acceptable. \u201d I have my own answer to this , but I \u2019 m curious what you think the acceptable level of inequality is .\nMy answer has to do with something called social capital , which is a social science term that generally refers to the amount of trust that we all have in each other and in our institutions . And when things get so unfair that that trust becomes eroded , that \u2019 s when you know you \u2019 ve gone too far . That \u2019 s when you know that things have become too unequal . Another way that you would know it is when you see class mobility , intergenerational class mobility , start to decline .\nNow , we \u2019 ve only been in this neoliberal paradigm for 40 years , so it \u2019 s a little too early to know what the intergenerational data will look like , but we can already see the gross inequalities and the erosion of social capital . That , to me , is enough of a warning sign . We know enough to know we have to course-correct or risk disaster .\n\u201c The system offends the moral sensibilities even of people who are benefiting from it \u201d\nIn the book , you catalogue all of these solutions to the problem \u2014 more income redistribution , better tax reform , something like a universal basic income , a new social contract between business and society , more access to higher education , etc . \u2014 and I agree with most of it . But I \u2019 m not confident we have the political will to get these things done .\nIf I \u2019 m right about that , what do you think is going to happen in the short to medium term ?\nFirst , let me just say that it will be easier to do these sorts of things than it will be to go full socialist . If we lack the political will to fix the kind of capitalism we have , then there \u2019 s surely a higher political barrier to the full socialist model of national health insurance , free college for everybody , and guaranteed income for every individual , whether they work or not .\nSo if you \u2019 re saying that things have to get worse before they get better , you may be right . However , if you look at public opinion polls , if you look at the recent election , I think the will may be already there . Again , I see the success of the # MeToo movement as a great example of what \u2019 s possible .\nThe # MeToo movement is a misguided comparison . We \u2019 re talking about broad changes in our political and economic system , changes that directly threaten the most entrenched financial interests in this country . I think you \u2019 re right about public sentiment , but I \u2019 m not at all convinced that the financial class is prepared to relinquish anything .\nIn fact , we \u2019 ve seen the big banks essentially go right back to the sorts of behaviors that produced the financial crash in 2008 , and we just saw Republicans pass an egregious tax cut that will deepen the very inequalities we \u2019 re talking about here .\nWell , it \u2019 s worth remembering that social norms change before policy changes , not the other way around . But yes , I agree that the GOP tax cut was enormously irresponsible and unfair . These are the sorts of things that can cause the public to say , \u201c Enough is enough . \u201d\nMy view is that we \u2019 re at a tipping point now and things are about to change . You and I may disagree about what , exactly , we need to do , or how far we need to go , but I think there are enough positive signs in public opinion that suggest we \u2019 re at a tipping point .",
