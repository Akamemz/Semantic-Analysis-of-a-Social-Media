    "content": "DETROIT \u2014 Facing a rising chorus of voices demanding he step down because of sexual harassment claims , U.S. Rep. John Conyers Jr. , on Tuesday retired from the seat he has held for more than five decades , a swift and crushing fall from grace for a civil rights icon and the longest-serving active member of Congress .\nSaying he was finalizing his plans for retirement , Conyers , D-Mich. , added he would endorse his son , John Conyers III , to replace him in Congress , potentially setting up a fight between him and his cousin , state Sen. Ian Conyers , in a special election to be called by the governor .\nIn his statement on the Mildred Gaddis Show on WPZR-FM in Detroit on Tuesday morning , Conyers did not describe it as a resignation but said his decision was immediate , suggesting the difference may be little . His lawyer , Arnold Reed , also confirmed that Conyers was leaving the seat as of Tuesday .\n`` My legacy can \u2019 t be compromised or diminished in any way by what we \u2019 re going through now . This too shall pass . ... My legacy will continue through my children , '' Conyers told Gaddis . `` I am retiring today and I want everyone to know how much I appreciate the ... incredible , undiminished support I 've received across the years from my supporters not only from my district but across the country as well . ''\nAs for the accusations against him , Conyers said , `` They 're not accurate , they 're not true and they 're something I ca n't explain where they came from . ''\nU.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee , D-Texas , read a statement from Conyers on the floor of the House about 11 a.m. saying he had notified House Speaker Paul Ryan , Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Michigan Gov . Rick Snyder of his decision . In it , he said that with the accusations against him , `` I recognize that ... due process will be denied to me . ''\nSnyder 's office said it had not heard yet from Conyers as of just before noon , despite the statement read on the House floor .\nHe will probably receive a yearly pension of about $ 139,200 \u2014 compared with his current pay of $ 174,000 a year . Between a congressional package and Social Security , Conyers could make more than $ 230,000 a year , but for rules limiting pension to no more than 80 % of current pay . In addition , Conyers will be able to maintain coverage through exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 as other members of Congress do \u2014 with the federal government picking up about 72 % of the cost .\nConyers , 88 , made his decision to quit Congress two weeks after an article on BuzzFeed.com detailed a secret settlement of more than $ 27,000 with a former staffer who accused him of making sexual advances toward her and paying her out of funds from his taxpayer-supported office .\nWithin days , several other women had come forward with accusations against Conyers , who , despite his denials that he harassed anyone , saw House leaders and members of his own party abandon him , with three of the four Democrats in the Michigan delegation calling for him to resign last Thursday .\nThe House Ethics Committee \u2014 with authority to recommend any action from none to censure or expulsion \u2014 had launched an investigation against Conyers .\nMore : Congress Ethics chairs request more data to determine extent of sex harassment payouts\nWithin moments of Conyers ' statement Tuesday morning , Capitol Hill began to react , with U.S. Rep. Jerrold Nadler , D-N.Y. , who replaced him as ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee only a week ago in the wake of the allegations , saying , `` I am saddened that his service to our nation has had to end under these circumstances . ''\nIn addition to Marion Brown , the staffer who received the settlement , at least six other women claimed they either experienced or saw him touching and rubbing women in his office , making sexual advances toward them or making inappropriate remarks . The most recent , Elisa Grubbs , made accusations against Conyers on Monday night , saying in a statement that Conyers put his hand up her skirt at a church , among other allegations .\nAmong the others , one filed a lawsuit against him early this year and then withdrew it , saying she did n't want to hurt Conyers ' reputation . Another woman , Washington lawyer Melanie Sloan , also told the Detroit Free Press last month that Conyers had verbally mistreated her , forced her to babysit his children and , on one occasion , showed up at a meeting with her at his office in his underwear \u2014 though she did n't consider it sexual harassment .\nAs late as Tuesday morning , there were reports that Conyers would fight on , choosing to remain in office until the end of his current term and then retire in early 2019 .
