His critique overlooks the details of this particular case as well as the general rarity of terrorism by immigrants .\nAhmad Khan Rahami , the 28-year-old man police arrested on Monday in connection with the bombings , is a naturalized U.S. citizen who immigrated to the United States from Afghanistan at the age of 7 . He seems to have been radicalized within the last few years , a period when he spent nearly a year in Pakistan and became noticeably more religious and taciturn .\nIt is hard to imagine how the `` extreme vetting '' Trump advocates for immigrants from `` any nation that has been compromised by terrorism '' could have kept Rahami out of the country . What questions could have been posed to his parents that would have predicted his violent turn two decades later ?\nTrump faults his Democratic opponent , Hillary Clinton , for supporting the admission of Syrian refugees , who he says pose an unacceptable risk of terrorism . But according to a recent study by Cato Institute immigration policy analyst Alex Nowrasteh , `` the chance of an American being murdered in a terrorist attack caused by a refugee is 1 in 3.64 billion per year .

''\nA broad moratorium would have the advantage of preventing all terrorist attacks by newly admitted immigrants .

Based on a value of $ 15 million per life , he puts `` the combined human , property , business , and economic costs '' of attacks by foreign-born terrorists during the 41-year period covered by his study at $ 5.3 billion annually , which is `` far less than the minimum estimated yearly benefit of $ 229.1 billion from immigration and tourism .
