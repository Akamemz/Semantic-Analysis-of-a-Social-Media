Issa told Secretary of State John F. Kerry to provide all communications regarding the talking points from 10 department officials , including Victoria Nuland , who was chief spokeswoman at the time , and Deputy Secretary William Burns .\n\u201c The State Department has not lived up to the administration \u2019 s broad and unambiguous promises of cooperation with Congress , \u201d Mr. Issa said in a letter to Mr. Kerry that accompanied the subpoena .\nThe White House released some emails two weeks ago that showed Ms. Nuland expressing reservations about some of the information in early versions of the talking points , which then were edited to delete references to al Qaeda .

Rice , U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , five days after the Sept. 11 assault , linked the attack to protests in Cairo , reportedly fueled by anger against an American-made video denigrating Islam \u2019 s Prophet Muhammad .\nThe State Department said Tuesday that it \u201c remains committed to working cooperatively with the Congress \u201d and promised to \u201c take stock of any new or outstanding requests for information , and determine the appropriate next steps . \u201d\n\u201c All of us \u2014 in the administration , in the Congress , in the media \u2014 we should all be focused on the issue of protecting the American diplomats and development experts who are working every day to advance America \u2019 s national interest and global leadership , \u201d department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said .\nRepublicans have charged that the administration altered the talking points to try to improve President Obama \u2019 s re-election chances by obfuscating al Qaeda links to the attack , which killed four Americans , including U.S .
