Devin Nunes ( R-CA ) , alleges serious abuses of power by the FBI during its investigation into the Trump campaign \u2019 s ties to Russia . House Republicans and conservative media have cast it as proof of President Donald Trump \u2019 s long-running allegations of FBI bias against him ; Democrats say it \u2019 s deeply misleading , twisting and cherry-picking classified intelligence to make the president seem right .\nThe memo was finally released to the public on Friday afternoon , four days after House Republicans voted to release it .

Rank & File are great people ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) February 2 , 2018\nUltimately , the document raises the question : Is there an anti-Trump bias at the FBI , and if so , does it justify placing the historically independent bureau under Trump \u2019 s personal control ? It \u2019 s a question with profound implications for the health of American democracy , and one that explains why the memo became such a source of controversy .\nWhat follows is a guide to the biggest questions swirling around the Nunes memo .\n1 ) Who is Devin Nunes , and why did he prepare this memo ?\nDevin Nunes is the chair of the House Intelligence Committee and a longtime Trump ally . He served on Trump \u2019 s transition team after the election and defended former national security adviser Michael Flynn when he was ( credibly , it turns out ) accused of lying about his contacts with Russia last February .\nNunes \u201c seemed to go out of his way to defend Trump , \u201d the Washington Post \u2019 s Aaron Blake wrote , \u201c in a way few others did . \u201d\nPerhaps the clearest example arose after Trump tweeted in March that President Obama had \u201c wiretapped \u201d Trump Tower during the 2016 presidential campaign . The heads of both the NSA and the FBI categorically denied that any such wiretapping had occurred . But Nunes quickly came to Trump \u2019 s defense , holding a press conference to announce that \u201c the intelligence community incidentally collected information about US citizens involved in the Trump transition . \u201d\nWhat this actually meant is that some Trump transition personnel had been in contact with foreigners legally under surveillance , and their conversations were intercepted as part of that surveillance ( that \u2019 s what \u201c incidentally collected \u201d means ) . This , needless to say , did not justify Trump \u2019 s claim that the Obama administration was spying on his campaign headquarters .\nHowever , the timing of Nunes \u2019 s press conference and the confusing way in which Nunes presented the information made it seem like he was trying to provide cover for Trump . The president himself said Nunes \u2019 s revelation \u201c somewhat \u201d vindicated his tweets .\nThen it turned out that Nunes got his information from the Trump White House itself . Ezra Cohen-Watnick , the National Security Council \u2019 s senior director for intelligence , uncovered the information ; Michael Ellis , a White House attorney who worked for Nunes prior to the Trump administration , personally took it to Nunes .\nTo recap : Nunes released information in such a manner as to make it look like Trump \u2019 s claims of being persecuted by law enforcement were true \u2014 and did so after secretly getting the information from the Trump White House . The situation proved to be such an embarrassment that Nunes was forced to recuse himself from the intelligence committee \u2019 s investigation into Russia for eight months during a House ethics investigation into his conduct .\nSo when news broke in mid-January that Nunes had been working in secret to prepare a memo on FBI surveillance of the Trump campaign , the initial sense among intelligence experts was that it would be a repeat of the wiretapping debacle \u2014 Nunes misrepresenting intelligence to support President Trump \u2019 s political position .\nBut many of Nunes \u2019 s colleagues in the House saw it as damning proof of anti-Trump animus at the FBI . They started a public campaign , backed by conservative media , to # ReleaseTheMemo . This culminated in Friday \u2019 s release .\nThe memo focuses on surveillance of Carter Page , a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser with business ties to Russia and open sympathies with the Kremlin \u2019 s foreign policy . The key allegation is that the surveillance of Page was improperly authorized \u2014 and potentially politically motivated .\nIn July 2016 , while advising the Trump campaign , Page flew to Moscow and met with Russian officials . This raised eyebrows among US intelligence officers , to say the least . So the FBI and DOJ put together an application to a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) court \u2014 a court that approves surveillance warrants pertaining to national security and foreign intelligence \u2014 to start watching Page . The court granted the application .\nThe Nunes memo alleges that this surveillance was not properly vetted by the court ; specifically , that it relied on the now-infamous Steele dossier , the document prepared by former British spy Christopher Steele alleging the existence of a conspiracy between Donald Trump and the Russian government . Steele \u2019 s research was , partially and indirectly , financed by the Clinton campaign \u2014 which the memo alleges is a major problem .\nThe Steele dossier , Nunes writes in the memo , \u201c formed an essential part of the Carter Page application. \u201d Nunes goes on to suggest that the application omitted several key facts about the Steele dossier that undermine its credibility , the most notable being the dossier \u2019 s financial backing from Democrats , and that Steele himself expressed opposition to Donald Trump becoming president .\nThere are lots of problems with the memo \u2019 s line of reasoning . For one thing , Steele is a respected investigator , and some of his dossier \u2019 s less explosive allegations have so far proven to be true . The FBI \u2019 s surveillance application may have relied on Steele \u2019 s findings , but if that \u2019 s true , it doesn \u2019 t necessarily discredit the application .\nThe memo \u2019 s claims are also impossible to evaluate without seeing the underlying intelligence it was based on . Nunes could have highlighted the FBI \u2019 s citation of Steele without mentioning other , more concrete sources the agency listed .\nMoreover , the FBI relies on sources with axes to grind all the time \u2014 people typically don \u2019 t go to the authorities with damaging information about people they like . The key question in an application like this isn \u2019 t whether the source liked the target ; it \u2019 s whether the specific claims they \u2019 re making are credible . The memo doesn \u2019 t address this at all .\nPerhaps most fundamentally , the memo doesn \u2019 t ever substantiate core assertions about political bias on the FBI \u2019 s part . The memo \u2019 s overall method of argument is to imply something suspicious without asserting malfeasance outright .\nFor example , the memo repeatedly notes that the DOJ knew that \u201c political actors \u201d were involved in the financing the Steele dossier . It implies that the FBI knew they were Democrats and chose to ignore it .\nBut that \u2019 s never clearly stated , and for good reason . The firm that employed Steele was initially contracted by a conservative publication , the Washington Free Beacon , not any Democrats or Democratic political campaign . It \u2019 s possible the FBI knew of the Free Beacon \u2019 s involvement or was aware that some political actor was involved in funding it \u2014 but didn \u2019 t know about the Clinton campaign \u2019 s involvement . The memo never clarifies which \u201c political actors \u201d it means .\nThis is why the early assessment from intelligence experts is that there isn \u2019 t really a lot of there there .\n\u201c If this is their evidence of \u2018 Worse than Watergate , \u2019 it \u2019 s thin , \u201d Julian Sanchez , an expert on surveillance at the libertarian Cato Institute , writes . \u201c This reads like something you \u2019 d put together to * sound * scandalous to someone who isn \u2019 t going to parse it closely . \u201d\nThe memo isn \u2019 t just about the initial FISA application . FISA warrants on Americans , like Page , expire after 90 days \u2014 which means the Bureau needs to petition for a renewal every 90 days if they want to keep snooping on a target .\nThis happened repeatedly with Page . One of those renewals was signed off on by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein \u2014 the man currently supervising special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s Russia investigation .\nRosenstein is only mentioned once in the memo \u2014 he \u2019 s one of several officials who signed off on renewing the Page warrant . But his inclusion is especially important . \u201c Republicans , \u201d the New York Times speculates , \u201c could potentially use Mr. Rosenstein \u2019 s decision to approve the renewal to suggest that he failed to properly vet a highly sensitive application for a warrant to spy on Mr. Page . \u201d\nThe memo somewhat implies that the Russia investigation is a corrupt partisan hatchet job . By bringing Rosenstein into it , it also ends up indicting the man currently in charge of the Russia investigation \u2014 suggesting he \u2019 s at best incompetent and at worst corrupt . Theoretically , this would provide cause for Trump to dismiss Rosenstein .\nTrump currently can \u2019 t fire Mueller without Rosenstein \u2019 s approval and Rosenstein said in December that there is no \u201c good cause \u201d to fire Mueller . If the president were to fire Rosenstein based on the memo , he might eventually be able to dismiss Mueller .\nThere isn \u2019 t a lot of support for such a firing in the memo . Typically , FISA warrants only get renewed if they uncover new evidence that justifies continuing the surveillance . It seems plausible that this could have happened with Page , given his Russian connections . In 2013 , for example , Russian agents approached him with the intent of turning him into an asset ( a point the Nunes memo never notes ) .\n\u201c It \u2019 s [ the FISA application ] reapproved if you have new information justifying the original probable cause and the government \u2019 s need to listen , \u201d writes Asha Rangappa , a former FBI special agent and current Yale lecturer , suggesting the memo actually shows that the government had good cause to surveil page .\nSo if Trump wants to fire Rosenstein based on one line in the Nunes memo , it would be quite a stretch .\n4 ) Why did House Republicans want to release the memo so much ?\nOstensibly , Republicans in the House pushed to release the memo because they believe it outlines surveillance abuses the American people need to know about .\n\u201c Let \u2019 s have a great debate about its consequences and the opportunity it presents to make things better , so these things never happen again , \u201d Rep. Matt Gaetz ( R-FL ) said in a January 30 speech on the House floor .\nBut experts on the FISA system , even civil libertarians critical of the way law enforcement uses it , note that these Republicans aren \u2019 t proposing any changes to how FISA works , or even suggesting that the system in general needs reform to stop any future abuses .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a conspicuous lack of interest in drawing any policy conclusions from what they purportedly consider a major institutional scandal , \u201d said Sanchez , the Cato expert .\nInstead , the motivation for the push to release the memo seemed purely political . Many of the most vigorous supporters of # ReleaseTheMemo , like Gaetz , have also called on President Trump to get rid of Robert Mueller . \u201c I think the president should \u2019 ve fired Mueller long ago , \u201d Gaetz said in a December interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nThese are people who seem to either genuinely believe that the Russia investigation is a partisan witch hunt targeting the president or believe there \u2019 s some political advantage to be gained from championing an anti-FBI crusade near and dear to both the president \u2019 s and Fox News \u2019 s heart .\nEither way , experts say the motivation behind the memo \u2019 s release seems pretty clear \u2014 it \u2019 s a way of waging war on the Russia investigation specifically and the FBI in general .\n\u201c The release of the memo , and the fabrication of a set of ideas around the memo , empowers Trump to go after the FBI , \u201d Ryan Goodman , a former Defense Department special counsel and current editor of Just Security , said . \u201c The ultimate goal is undermining the Mueller investigation . There doesn \u2019 t seem to be another reason for the president to be so obsessed with Rod Rosenstein and to be gunning for him . \u201d\nThe FBI and Democrats don \u2019 t like the Nunes memo for one big reason : They think it \u2019 s full of lies .\nOn Wednesday , the FBI put out a strongly worded statement signaling the agency \u2019 s worry with the memo \u2019 s accuracy :\nThe FBI takes seriously its obligations to the FISA Court and its compliance with procedures overseen by career professionals in the Department of Justice and the FBI . We are committed to working with the appropriate oversight entities to ensure the continuing integrity of the FISA process . With regard to the House Intelligence Committee \u2019 s memorandum , the FBI was provided a limited opportunity to review this memo the day before the committee voted to release it . As expressed during our initial review , we have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo \u2019 s accuracy .\nRep. Adam Schiff ( D-CA ) , the top Democrat on the House Select Intelligence Committee , said after the statement that he sided with the FBI . \u201c I think the FBI is exactly right . I have the same grave concerns over it. \u201d He added that he knew of the FBI \u2019 s concerns before he voted against the memo \u2019 s release .\nSchiff and his fellow Democrats on the committee also went the extra step of compiling a 10-page memo of their own . It reportedly asserts two things : First , that the FBI didn \u2019 t abuse its FISA power when requesting the Page warrant , and second \u2014more importantly \u2014 that the Nunes memo is simply an effort to help the White House discredit the Mueller probe .\nOn Monday , Rep. Mike Quigley ( D-IL ) asked Nunes if his staffers worked with the White House on his memo . Nunes originally answered the question by saying \u201c as far as I know , \u201d no one collaborated with the White House . Ultimately , though , he refused to answer the question \u2014 perhaps suggesting that there may actually have been some collusion there .\nThe House Intelligence Committee , however , voted not to make the Democratic memo public on Monday . There have been no moves towards releasing it since .\nTrump didn \u2019 t offer a clear public explanation . But based on other things he \u2019 s said , the reason seems clear : He has publicly stated several times that the Trump-Russia probe is a \u201c witch hunt \u201d perpetrated by rogue partisans within the FBI . The memo , he and his allies on the Hill believe , support this position .\n\u201c Trump is shockingly overt about believing that the problem here is that the FBI is staffed by loyalists to the wrong person , \u201d Sanchez said . \u201c He does , in fact , seem to think that the job of the DOJ , and the FBI , and the rest of the intelligence community is to protect the president and follow his orders \u2014 including going after his political enemies based on stuff he saw on Fox News , if that \u2019 s what he wants to do . \u201d\nIronically , the memo concludes on a note that actually could vindicate the broader Russia investigation .\nThe last paragraph of the memo is all about the FISA application \u2019 s references to George Papadopoulos . The Trump campaign foreign policy adviser also had connections with Russia \u2014 he had been approached by a Russian-linked professor in London in the spring of 2016 who told him the Kremlin had dirt on Hillary Clinton .\nThe memo admits , crucially , that the Trump-Russia investigation originated with Papadopoulos \u2019 s misbehavior , not Page \u2019 s . \u201c The Papadopoulos information , \u201d the memo says , \u201c triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016 . \u201d\nThis shows that even if the Carter Page FISA application were flawed , the Trump-Russia investigation had another foundation \u2014 evidence about Papadopoulos \u2019 s Russian contacts . That means you can \u2019 t discredit the entire Russia investigation by pointing to the Page warrant .\nThe memo tries to insinuate that this too was biased against Trump \u2014 noting that one of the FBI agents handling the Papadopoulos situation , Peter Strzok , had sent some text messages critical of Trump to his \u201c mistress , \u201d FBI attorney Lisa Page . But at this point , we know that the information on Papadopoulos was true \u2014 because he pled guilty to lying to the FBI and gave a ton of information to special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s office .\nSo if this is an attempt to buttress Trump \u2019 s campaign against the Russia investigation , as his past behavior would suggest , it \u2019 s not an especially successful one .\n7 ) What happens now that the memo has been released ?\nThe issue now moves beyond the realm of fact and into politics . The question isn \u2019 t so much what the Nunes memo says , but how those findings are interpreted by various different political actors .\nThe many holes in the Nunes memo \u2019 s reasoning and evidence could end up undermining the case against the Russia probe . Worse , the fallout of the release could lead to more leaks proving that Nunes \u2019 s account is wrong . In that scenario , it would end up as an unforced error .\nBut it \u2019 s also possible that this gets coded in entirely partisan terms \u2014 with conservatives and Republicans seeing the memo as damning and it leading to a renewed assault on the FBI and the Mueller probe . Some conservatives are already taking Nunes \u2019 s memo at face value and lambasting the FBI as a partisan , anti-Trump agency .\nSince Republicans control the majority in both Houses of Congress , their reaction in the next few days is vital . It \u2019 s still too early to tell just what that \u2019 ll be .\nThe campaign to release the memo was part of a much larger conservative effort to discredit the Mueller investigation . Its release could end up serving as pretext for removing those responsible for the Mueller probe .\nAccording to the Washington Post , Trump told his close advisers prior to the memo \u2019 s release that it could give him the ammo he needs to fire Rosenstein or force him to resign . Trump could replace Rosenstein with someone friendlier to the Trump administration and more willing to constrain Mueller . That could prove more detrimental to the Mueller probe in the long run .\nRangappa , the Yale expert , writes that the deputy attorney general could effectively cripple the Mueller investigation by rejecting Mueller \u2019 s requests to investigate more people , obtain new evidence , or pursue charges against additional people , for instance . More simply , the new appointee could just fire Mueller .\nAgain , this is more of a political game than a legal one . Nunes and many conservatives say there \u2019 s proof in the memo that the FBI is corrupt , and the FBI and Democrats say this is all a smokescreen to protect the president .\nSo what \u2019 s likely to happen in the coming days is escalating conflict between House Republicans and Trump administration officials who want the president to fire Rosenstein and shut down the Russia probe , and the FBI and Democrats who oppose all of this .\nThere are two broad ways an extended political war between the FBI and Trump and his allies could go . In the first , the FBI is brought to heel , and Rosenstein and other senior FBI executives are fired and replaced with more Trump-friendly appointees . The Mueller investigation is quashed , and the bureau essentially serves more like an arm of the Trump administration than as a quasi-independent agency .\nThe implications of this scenario for American democracy are pretty scary .\n\u201c I shudder to think what the [ 2020 ] election looks like when you \u2019 ve got a guy who says , \u2018 I saw Fox & Friends this morning and my opponent is a crook \u2019 ... except now you \u2019 ve got an FBI and a DOJ that say , \u2018 Yes , sir , \u2019 \u201d says Sanchez .\nIn the second scenario , the memo leads to a lot of FBI-Republican skirmishing but no actual showdown . Trump either decides not to fire Rosenstein or is somehow stopped from doing so , the Mueller investigation continues unhampered , and the FBI remains relatively untainted by political influence .\nThere are many factors that could determine which of these two outcomes plays out . Two of the key ones are congressional Republicans , particularly Senate Republicans , and Trump \u2019 s own staff .\nSenate Republicans have been notably quieter and more restrained about attacking the FBI than their peers in the House . Senate Republicans also have to confirm Trump appointees to the Justice Department ; they could make clear that if he fires Rosenstein/Mueller and tries to appoint a crony to take their place , they won \u2019 t confirm whomever he picks .\nWhat influential Senate Republicans say and do in the days after the memo \u2019 s release , in short , could signal to Trump whether he has enough backing to really take on the FBI .\n\u201c This particular president advances when he senses weakness , \u201d Goodman said . \u201c The critical factor is the will of many Republicans to stand up . \u201d\nThere are some encouraging signs on this front . Sen. John McCain ( R-AZ ) , for example , responded to the memo with a condemnation of the entire campaign to undermine the DOJ and FBI . \u201c The latest attacks on the FBI and Department of Justice serve no American interests \u2014 no party \u2019 s , no president \u2019 s , only Putin \u2019 s , \u201d he wrote .\nMembers of Trump \u2019 s White House are also an important check , having blocked his moves to interfere with the Mueller probe in the past .\nThe New York Times reports that in June , Trump ordered White House counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller . McGahn said he \u2019 d rather resign than do that , and Trump backed down . He was , according to the Times , \u201c concerned that firing the special counsel would incite more questions about whether the White House was trying to obstruct the Russia investigation . \u201d\nIf McGahn and other voices of relative restraint in the White House succeed in constraining the president \u2019 s impulse to act , or even refuse to carry out his orders , then it \u2019 s possible that the whole memo mess will amount to little in the end .",
    "content_original": "The biggest issue in American politics right now is something called \u201cthe Nunes memo.\u201d\n\nThe four-page document, prepared by Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), alleges serious abuses of power by the FBI during its investigation into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia.

Rank & File are great people! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2018\n\nUltimately, the document raises the question: Is there an anti-Trump bias at the FBI, and if so, does it justify placing the historically independent bureau under Trump\u2019s personal control? It\u2019s a question with profound implications for the health of American democracy, and one that explains why the memo became such a source of controversy.\n\nWhat follows is a guide to the biggest questions swirling around the Nunes memo.\n\n1) Who is Devin Nunes, and why did he prepare this memo?\n\nDevin Nunes is the chair of the House Intelligence Committee and a longtime Trump ally. He served on Trump\u2019s transition team after the election and defended former national security adviser Michael Flynn when he was (credibly, it turns out) accused of lying about his contacts with Russia last February.\n\nNunes \u201cseemed to go out of his way to defend Trump,\u201d the Washington Post\u2019s Aaron Blake wrote, \u201cin a way few others did.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the clearest example arose after Trump tweeted in March that President Obama had \u201cwiretapped\u201d Trump Tower during the 2016 presidential campaign. The heads of both the NSA and the FBI categorically denied that any such wiretapping had occurred. But Nunes quickly came to Trump\u2019s defense, holding a press conference to announce that \u201cthe intelligence community incidentally collected information about US citizens involved in the Trump transition.\u201d\n\nWhat this actually meant is that some Trump transition personnel had been in contact with foreigners legally under surveillance, and their conversations were intercepted as part of that surveillance (that\u2019s what \u201cincidentally collected\u201d means).

The president himself said Nunes\u2019s revelation \u201csomewhat\u201d vindicated his tweets.\n\nThen it turned out that Nunes got his information from the Trump White House itself. Ezra Cohen-Watnick, the National Security Council\u2019s senior director for intelligence, uncovered the information; Michael Ellis, a White House attorney who worked for Nunes prior to the Trump administration, personally took it to Nunes.\n\nTo recap: Nunes released information in such a manner as to make it look like Trump\u2019s claims of being persecuted by law enforcement were true \u2014 and did so after secretly getting the information from the Trump White House. The situation proved to be such an embarrassment that Nunes was forced to recuse himself from the intelligence committee\u2019s investigation into Russia for eight months during a House ethics investigation into his conduct.\n\nSo when news broke in mid-January that Nunes had been working in secret to prepare a memo on FBI surveillance of the Trump campaign, the initial sense among intelligence experts was that it would be a repeat of the wiretapping debacle \u2014 Nunes misrepresenting intelligence to support President Trump\u2019s political position.\n\nBut many of Nunes\u2019s colleagues in the House saw it as damning proof of anti-Trump animus at the FBI. They started a public campaign, backed by conservative media, to #ReleaseTheMemo. This culminated in Friday\u2019s release.\n\n2) What does the Nunes memo allege?\n\nThe memo focuses on surveillance of Carter Page, a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser with business ties to Russia and open sympathies with the Kremlin\u2019s foreign policy. The key allegation is that the surveillance of Page was improperly authorized \u2014 and potentially politically motivated.\n\nIn July 2016, while advising the Trump campaign, Page flew to Moscow and met with Russian officials. This raised eyebrows among US intelligence officers, to say the least. So the FBI and DOJ put together an application to a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court \u2014 a court that approves surveillance warrants pertaining to national security and foreign intelligence \u2014 to start watching Page. The court granted the application.\n\nThe Nunes memo alleges that this surveillance was not properly vetted by the court; specifically, that it relied on the now-infamous Steele dossier, the document prepared by former British spy Christopher Steele alleging the existence of a conspiracy between Donald Trump and the Russian government. Steele\u2019s research was, partially and indirectly, financed by the Clinton campaign \u2014 which the memo alleges is a major problem.\n\nThe Steele dossier, Nunes writes in the memo, \u201cformed an essential part of the Carter Page application.\u201d Nunes goes on to suggest that the application omitted several key facts about the Steele dossier that undermine its credibility, the most notable being the dossier\u2019s financial backing from Democrats, and that Steele himself expressed opposition to Donald Trump becoming president.\n\nThere are lots of problems with the memo\u2019s line of reasoning. For one thing, Steele is a respected investigator, and some of his dossier\u2019s less explosive allegations have so far proven to be true. The FBI\u2019s surveillance application may have relied on Steele\u2019s findings, but if that\u2019s true, it doesn\u2019t necessarily discredit the application.\n\nThe memo\u2019s claims are also impossible to evaluate without seeing the underlying intelligence it was based on. Nunes could have highlighted the FBI\u2019s citation of Steele without mentioning other, more concrete sources the agency listed.\n\nMoreover, the FBI relies on sources with axes to grind all the time \u2014 people typically don\u2019t go to the authorities with damaging information about people they like. The key question in an application like this isn\u2019t whether the source liked the target; it\u2019s whether the specific claims they\u2019re making are credible. The memo doesn\u2019t address this at all.\n\nPerhaps most fundamentally, the memo doesn\u2019t ever substantiate core assertions about political bias on the FBI\u2019s part. The memo\u2019s overall method of argument is to imply something suspicious without asserting malfeasance outright.\n\nFor example, the memo repeatedly notes that the DOJ knew that \u201cpolitical actors\u201d were involved in the financing the Steele dossier.

The firm that employed Steele was initially contracted by a conservative publication, the Washington Free Beacon, not any Democrats or Democratic political campaign. It\u2019s possible the FBI knew of the Free Beacon\u2019s involvement or was aware that some political actor was involved in funding it \u2014 but didn\u2019t know about the Clinton campaign\u2019s involvement. The memo never clarifies which \u201cpolitical actors\u201d it means.\n\nThis is why the early assessment from intelligence experts is that there isn\u2019t really a lot of there there.\n\n\u201cIf this is their evidence of \u2018Worse than Watergate,\u2019 it\u2019s thin,\u201d Julian Sanchez, an expert on surveillance at the libertarian Cato Institute, writes. \u201cThis reads like something you\u2019d put together to *sound* scandalous to someone who isn\u2019t going to parse it closely.\u201d\n\n3) Does the Nunes memo implicate anyone important?\n\nThe memo isn\u2019t just about the initial FISA application. FISA warrants on Americans, like Page, expire after 90 days \u2014 which means the Bureau needs to petition for a renewal every 90 days if they want to keep snooping on a target.\n\nThis happened repeatedly with Page. One of those renewals was signed off on by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein \u2014 the man currently supervising special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation.\n\nRosenstein is only mentioned once in the memo \u2014 he\u2019s one of several officials who signed off on renewing the Page warrant. But his inclusion is especially important. \u201cRepublicans,\u201d the New York Times speculates, \u201ccould potentially use Mr. Rosenstein\u2019s decision to approve the renewal to suggest that he failed to properly vet a highly sensitive application for a warrant to spy on Mr. Page.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s actually deeper than that.\n\nThe memo somewhat implies that the Russia investigation is a corrupt partisan hatchet job. By bringing Rosenstein into it, it also ends up indicting the man currently in charge of the Russia investigation \u2014 suggesting he\u2019s at best incompetent and at worst corrupt. Theoretically, this would provide cause for Trump to dismiss Rosenstein.\n\nTrump currently can\u2019t fire Mueller without Rosenstein\u2019s approval and Rosenstein said in December that there is no \u201cgood cause\u201d to fire Mueller. If the president were to fire Rosenstein based on the memo, he might eventually be able to dismiss Mueller.\n\nThere isn\u2019t a lot of support for such a firing in the memo. Typically, FISA warrants only get renewed if they uncover new evidence that justifies continuing the surveillance. It seems plausible that this could have happened with Page, given his Russian connections. In 2013, for example, Russian agents approached him with the intent of turning him into an asset (a point the Nunes memo never notes).\n\nThis, experts say, is almost certainly what happened.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s [the FISA application] reapproved if you have new information justifying the original probable cause and the government\u2019s need to listen,\u201d writes Asha Rangappa, a former FBI special agent and current Yale lecturer, suggesting the memo actually shows that the government had good cause to surveil page.\n\nSo if Trump wants to fire Rosenstein based on one line in the Nunes memo, it would be quite a stretch.\n\n4) Why did House Republicans want to release the memo so much?\n\nOstensibly, Republicans in the House pushed to release the memo because they believe it outlines surveillance abuses the American people need to know about.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s have a great debate about its consequences and the opportunity it presents to make things better, so these things never happen again,\u201d Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) said in a January 30 speech on the House floor.\n\nBut experts on the FISA system, even civil libertarians critical of the way law enforcement uses it, note that these Republicans aren\u2019t proposing any changes to how FISA works, or even suggesting that the system in general needs reform to stop any future abuses.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a conspicuous lack of interest in drawing any policy conclusions from what they purportedly consider a major institutional scandal,\u201d said Sanchez, the Cato expert.\n\nInstead, the motivation for the push to release the memo seemed purely political. Many of the most vigorous supporters of #ReleaseTheMemo, like Gaetz, have also called on President Trump to get rid of Robert Mueller. \u201cI think the president should\u2019ve fired Mueller long ago,\u201d Gaetz said in a December interview with Vox.\n\nThese are people who seem to either genuinely believe that the Russia investigation is a partisan witch hunt targeting the president or believe there\u2019s some political advantage to be gained from championing an anti-FBI crusade near and dear to both the president\u2019s and Fox News\u2019s heart.\n\nEither way, experts say the motivation behind the memo\u2019s release seems pretty clear \u2014 it\u2019s a way of waging war on the Russia investigation specifically and the FBI in general.\n\n\u201cThe release of the memo, and the fabrication of a set of ideas around the memo, empowers Trump to go after the FBI,\u201d Ryan Goodman, a former Defense Department special counsel and current editor of Just Security, said. \u201cThe ultimate goal is undermining the Mueller investigation. There doesn\u2019t seem to be another reason for the president to be so obsessed with Rod Rosenstein and to be gunning for him.\u201d\n\n5) Why did the FBI and Democrats oppose it?\n\nThe FBI and Democrats don\u2019t like the Nunes memo for one big reason: They think it\u2019s full of lies.\n\nOn Wednesday, the FBI put out a strongly worded statement signaling the agency\u2019s worry with the memo\u2019s accuracy:\n\nThe FBI takes seriously its obligations to the FISA Court and its compliance with procedures overseen by career professionals in the Department of Justice and the FBI. We are committed to working with the appropriate oversight entities to ensure the continuing integrity of the FISA process. With regard to the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s memorandum, the FBI was provided a limited opportunity to review this memo the day before the committee voted to release it. As expressed during our initial review, we have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo\u2019s accuracy.\n\nRep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the top Democrat on the House Select Intelligence Committee, said after the statement that he sided with the FBI. \u201cI think the FBI is exactly right. I have the same grave concerns over it.\u201d He added that he knew of the FBI\u2019s concerns before he voted against the memo\u2019s release.\n\nSchiff and his fellow Democrats on the committee also went the extra step of compiling a 10-page memo of their own. It reportedly asserts two things: First, that the FBI didn\u2019t abuse its FISA power when requesting the Page warrant, and second \u2014more importantly \u2014 that the Nunes memo is simply an effort to help the White House discredit the Mueller probe.\n\nOn Monday, Rep. Mike Quigley (D-IL) asked Nunes if his staffers worked with the White House on his memo. Nunes originally answered the question by saying \u201cas far as I know,\u201d no one collaborated with the White House. Ultimately, though, he refused to answer the question \u2014 perhaps suggesting that there may actually have been some collusion there.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee, however, voted not to make the Democratic memo public on Monday. There have been no moves towards releasing it since.\n\n6) Why did Trump approve releasing the Nunes memo?\n\nTrump didn\u2019t offer a clear public explanation. But based on other things he\u2019s said, the reason seems clear: He has publicly stated several times that the Trump-Russia probe is a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d perpetrated by rogue partisans within the FBI. The memo, he and his allies on the Hill believe, support this position.\n\n\u201cTrump is shockingly overt about believing that the problem here is that the FBI is staffed by loyalists to the wrong person,\u201d Sanchez said. \u201cHe does, in fact, seem to think that the job of the DOJ, and the FBI, and the rest of the intelligence community is to protect the president and follow his orders \u2014 including going after his political enemies based on stuff he saw on Fox News, if that\u2019s what he wants to do.\u201d\n\nIronically, the memo concludes on a note that actually could vindicate the broader Russia investigation.\n\nThe last paragraph of the memo is all about the FISA application\u2019s references to George Papadopoulos. The Trump campaign foreign policy adviser also had connections with Russia \u2014 he had been approached by a Russian-linked professor in London in the spring of 2016 who told him the Kremlin had dirt on Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe memo admits, crucially, that the Trump-Russia investigation originated with Papadopoulos\u2019s misbehavior, not Page\u2019s. \u201cThe Papadopoulos information,\u201d the memo says, \u201ctriggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016.\u201d\n\nThis shows that even if the Carter Page FISA application were flawed, the Trump-Russia investigation had another foundation \u2014 evidence about Papadopoulos\u2019s Russian contacts. That means you can\u2019t discredit the entire Russia investigation by pointing to the Page warrant.\n\nThe memo tries to insinuate that this too was biased against Trump \u2014 noting that one of the FBI agents handling the Papadopoulos situation, Peter Strzok, had sent some text messages critical of Trump to his \u201cmistress,\u201d FBI attorney Lisa Page. But at this point, we know that the information on Papadopoulos was true \u2014 because he pled guilty to lying to the FBI and gave a ton of information to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s office.\n\nSo if this is an attempt to buttress Trump\u2019s campaign against the Russia investigation, as his past behavior would suggest, it\u2019s not an especially successful one.\n\n7) What happens now that the memo has been released?\n\nThe issue now moves beyond the realm of fact and into politics. The question isn\u2019t so much what the Nunes memo says, but how those findings are interpreted by various different political actors.\n\nThe many holes in the Nunes memo\u2019s reasoning and evidence could end up undermining the case against the Russia probe. Worse, the fallout of the release could lead to more leaks proving that Nunes\u2019s account is wrong. In that scenario, it would end up as an unforced error.\n\nBut it\u2019s also possible that this gets coded in entirely partisan terms \u2014 with conservatives and Republicans seeing the memo as damning and it leading to a renewed assault on the FBI and the Mueller probe. Some conservatives are already taking Nunes\u2019s memo at face value and lambasting the FBI as a partisan, anti-Trump agency.\n\nSince Republicans control the majority in both Houses of Congress, their reaction in the next few days is vital. It\u2019s still too early to tell just what that\u2019ll be.\n\n8) Does this threaten the Mueller probe?\n\nPossibly.\n\nThe campaign to release the memo was part of a much larger conservative effort to discredit the Mueller investigation. Its release could end up serving as pretext for removing those responsible for the Mueller probe.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, Trump told his close advisers prior to the memo\u2019s release that it could give him the ammo he needs to fire Rosenstein or force him to resign. Trump could replace Rosenstein with someone friendlier to the Trump administration and more willing to constrain Mueller. That could prove more detrimental to the Mueller probe in the long run.\n\nRangappa, the Yale expert, writes that the deputy attorney general could effectively cripple the Mueller investigation by rejecting Mueller\u2019s requests to investigate more people, obtain new evidence, or pursue charges against additional people, for instance. More simply, the new appointee could just fire Mueller.\n\nAgain, this is more of a political game than a legal one. Nunes and many conservatives say there\u2019s proof in the memo that the FBI is corrupt, and the FBI and Democrats say this is all a smokescreen to protect the president.\n\nSo what\u2019s likely to happen in the coming days is escalating conflict between House Republicans and Trump administration officials who want the president to fire Rosenstein and shut down the Russia probe, and the FBI and Democrats who oppose all of this.\n\n9) How bad could the memo fallout get?\n\nThere are two broad ways an extended political war between the FBI and Trump and his allies could go. In the first, the FBI is brought to heel, and Rosenstein and other senior FBI executives are fired and replaced with more Trump-friendly appointees. The Mueller investigation is quashed, and the bureau essentially serves more like an arm of the Trump administration than as a quasi-independent agency.\n\nThe implications of this scenario for American democracy are pretty scary.\n\n\u201cI shudder to think what the [2020] election looks like when you\u2019ve got a guy who says, \u2018I saw Fox & Friends this morning and my opponent is a crook\u2019 ... except now you\u2019ve got an FBI and a DOJ that say, \u2018Yes, sir,\u2019\u201d says Sanchez.\n\nIn the second scenario, the memo leads to a lot of FBI-Republican skirmishing but no actual showdown. Trump either decides not to fire Rosenstein or is somehow stopped from doing so, the Mueller investigation continues unhampered, and the FBI remains relatively untainted by political influence.\n\nThere are many factors that could determine which of these two outcomes plays out. Two of the key ones are congressional Republicans, particularly Senate Republicans, and Trump\u2019s own staff.\n\nSenate Republicans have been notably quieter and more restrained about attacking the FBI than their peers in the House. Senate Republicans also have to confirm Trump appointees to the Justice Department; they could make clear that if he fires Rosenstein/Mueller and tries to appoint a crony to take their place, they won\u2019t confirm whomever he picks.\n\nWhat influential Senate Republicans say and do in the days after the memo\u2019s release, in short, could signal to Trump whether he has enough backing to really take on the FBI.\n\n\u201cThis particular president advances when he senses weakness,\u201d Goodman said. \u201cThe critical factor is the will of many Republicans to stand up.\u201d\n\nThere are some encouraging signs on this front. Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), for example, responded to the memo with a condemnation of the entire campaign to undermine the DOJ and FBI. \u201cThe latest attacks on the FBI and Department of Justice serve no American interests \u2014 no party\u2019s, no president\u2019s, only Putin\u2019s,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMembers of Trump\u2019s White House are also an important check, having blocked his moves to interfere with the Mueller probe in the past.\n\nThe New York Times reports that in June, Trump ordered White House counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller. McGahn said he\u2019d rather resign than do that, and Trump backed down. He was, according to the Times, \u201cconcerned that firing the special counsel would incite more questions about whether the White House was trying to obstruct the Russia investigation.\u201d\n\nIf McGahn and other voices of relative restraint in the White House succeed in constraining the president\u2019s impulse to act, or even refuse to carry out his orders, then it\u2019s possible that the whole memo mess will amount to little in the end.",
