If they vote to bar refugees , as expected , Burleigh County - home to about 95,000 people and the capital city of Bismarck - could become the first local government to do so since President Donald Trump issued an executive order making it possible .\nThe county postponed a vote last week when more than 100 people showed up and overflowed the commission \u2019 s normal meeting space . Monday night \u2019 s meeting will be held in a middle school cafeteria to accommodate public interest that Chairman Brian Bitner said is the most intense he \u2019 s seen in more than a decade on the commission .\nThough he declined to predict which way the commission would go , Bitner said he would vote against accepting additional refugees .\n\u201c The overwhelming public opinion is so clear to me , that I think if you vote for it , you \u2019 re not going to be reelected if you choose to run again , \u201d he said .\nTrump \u2019 s executive order this fall came as he had already proposed cutting the number of refugees next year to the lowest level since Congress passed the Refugee Act of 1980 . He declared that refugees should be resettled only in places where the state and local governments - counties - gave consent . Since then , many governors and counties around the country have declared that they would continue taking refugees .\nRepublican Gov . Doug Burgum said last month that North Dakota would continue accepting refugees where local jurisdictions agreed , and his spokesman said the governor saw it as a local decision .

Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney said refugees were needed to boost the city \u2019 s economy , and that 90 % were fully employed within three months of resettling in his city .\nBut the idea was quickly opposed in more conservative Burleigh County . Among the opponents was Republican state Rep. Rick Becker , of Bismarck , an ultraconservative who took to social media to criticize the program as unrestrained and a possible drain on social service programs , schools and law enforcement , though the county said it doesn \u2019 t track any costs directly related to refugees .\n\u201c This isn \u2019 t about skin color , \u201d said Becker , a plastic surgeon and former gubernatorial candidate . \u201c In the past , nobody had any say whatsoever .
