    "content": "President Trump disbanded two of his economic advisory councils Wednesday , faced with the embarrassing resignations of numerous business leaders amid rising condemnation over his comments about violence at a white nationalist rally and a liberal pressure campaign .\nMr. Trump abruptly announced that he was shuttering the business groups just after news broke that one of them , the President \u2019 s Strategic and Policy Forum chaired by Blackstone CEO and Trump confidante Stephen Schwarzman , intended to disband on its own .\nRather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum , I am ending both . Thank you all !\nEight members of the president \u2019 s American Manufacturing Council also had quit since Monday . Progressive groups took credit for flooding the CEOs \u2019 companies with thousands of phone calls to pressure them to dissociate from Mr. Trump .\n\u201c It doesn \u2019 t pay to stand with hate , and consumers across America gave the corporate world a wake-up call today , \u201d said John Burton , a former Obama administration official who works for the group Daily Action . \u201c Consumers today have more choices than ever , and they are demanding greater corporate responsibility \u2014 or they will take their business elsewhere . \u201d\nThe advisory councils were largely ceremonial . But the awkward shuttering of the groups that Mr. Trump created with fanfare just a few months ago showed how the president \u2019 s rhetoric on race has made him increasingly radioactive to corporate chiefs , a relationship that is supposed to be one of Mr. Trump \u2019 s strongest points in his push for an economic revival and tax reform .\nIt was the most obvious rebuke on another brutal day for Mr. Trump , who on Tuesday asserted that there were \u201c fine people \u201d on both sides of the racially motivated clashes provoked by white nationalists in Charlottesville , Virginia .\nBoth former Presidents Bush weighed in from retirement with a rare statement , saying that Americans \u201c must always reject racial bigotry , anti-Semitism , and hatred in all forms . \u201d\nIn the House , Democratic lawmakers said they will introduce a resolution to censure Mr. Trump .\nAs criticism escalated over the president \u2019 s comments that \u201c both sides \u201d were to blame for the violent clashes last weekend , Mr. Trump \u2019 s Cabinet members also faced calls for a mass resignation to repudiate Mr. Trump \u2019 s views .\nWhite House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon condemned white nationalist \u201c clowns \u201d and \u201c losers \u201d in an interview Wednesday but said Democrats are only helping Republicans by fixating on \u201c identity politics . \u201d\n\u201c The Democrats , the longer they talk about identity politics , I got \u2018 em , \u201d the former head of Breitbart told The American Prospect in an interview . \u201c I want them to talk about racism every day . If the left is focused on race and identity , and we go with economic nationalism , we can crush the Democrats . \u201d\nMr. Bannon dismissed the white nationalists who held a rally in Charlottesville , Virginia , last weekend .\n\u201c These guys are a collection of clowns , \u201d Mr. Bannon said . \u201c Ethno-nationalism \u2014 it \u2019 s losers . It \u2019 s a fringe element . I think the media plays it up too much , and we \u2019 ve got to help crush it , you know , uh , help crush it more . \u201d\nBut Republican strategist Steve Schmidt , who managed Sen. John McCain \u2019 s presidential bid in 2008 and served as a top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney , called it \u201c a time for choosing for all Republicans . \u201d\n\u201c You can not serve honorably and morally a president who holds these positions , \u201d he said on MSNBC , adding that Cabinet members such as Transportation Secretary Elaine L. Chao and chief White House economic adviser Gary Cohn have decisions to make .\nNo one defected Wednesday from the Cabinet or from the president \u2019 s inner circle of White House advisers . A source close to the West Wing said Mr. Cohn was \u201c crumbling , \u201d but other reports said he planned to stay in his post .\nThe heads of the Army , Navy , Marine Corps and Air Force independently issued strong condemnations of the bigotry and racism that spurred the violent clashes .\n\u201c The shameful events in Charlottesville are unacceptable and must not be tolerated . \u2026 [ T ] he Navy will forever stand against intolerance and hatred , \u201d Adm. John Richardson , the chief of naval operations , said in one of those statements , which he posted Wednesday on social media .\nOne of the few other administration officials to speak out Wednesday was Veterans Affairs Secretary David J. Shulkin , who said Mr. Trump clearly shares his views that bigotry can not be tolerated in the U.S .\n\u201c This is an affront to American ideals , \u201d Mr. Shulkin told reporters . \u201c This is an affront to civilization . We have fought against these beliefs . We \u2019 re not going to allow ourselves as a country to be drawn back there . \u201d\nMr. Shulkin , speaking at the president \u2019 s golf club in Bedminster , New Jersey , at the signing of a bill for veterans \u2019 education , said Mr. Trump \u201c has done a good job of speaking for himself . \u201d\n\u201c He \u2019 s denounced bigotry , hatred , violence , Nazis , white supremacists , \u201d Mr. Shulkin said . \u201c I think he has been very clear that this was not acceptable to him , that he has denounced them . \u201d\n\u201c We \u2019 ve heard from the vice president , we \u2019 ve heard from the Joint Chiefs of Staff , we \u2019 ve heard from Ivanka Trump , we \u2019 ve heard from many leaders throughout the country , \u201d he said .\nMs. Chao \u2019 s husband , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , issued a statement denouncing white supremacists while avoiding any direct mention of Mr. Trump .\n\u201c We can have no tolerance for an ideology of racial hatred , \u201d Mr. McConnell said . \u201c There are no good neo-Nazis , and those who espouse their views are not supporters of American ideals and freedoms . We all have a responsibility to stand against hate and violence , wherever it raises its evil head . \u201d\nSen. Lindsey Graham , South Carolina Republican , said Mr. Trump should be trying to unite the country .\n\u201c Your words are dividing Americans , not healing them , \u201d Mr. Graham told the president . \u201c Many Republicans do not agree with and will fight back against the idea that the party of Lincoln has a welcome mat out for the David Dukes of the world . \u201d\nMr. Trump was out of public view Wednesday , a day after his combative press conference in New York that revived criticism of his appearing to equate white nationalists with demonstrators who came out to confront them . The president traveled from Trump Tower in New York to his golf club in Bedminster , where he signed the legislation to boost veterans \u2019 education benefits .\nThe president also commented on the memorial service in Charlottesville for Heather Heyer , the 32-year-old who was killed when a car thought to be driven by a white nationalist rammed into a crowd of demonstrators Saturday . The president called her \u201c a truly special young woman . \u201d\nWhite House aides have said Mr. Trump didn \u2019 t seriously consider attending the memorial service , the kind of event that his predecessor , Barack Obama , frequently would use in part as a platform for issues such as gun control or racial tolerance .\nA group of congressional Democrats said Wednesday that they will ask Congress to take the rare step of officially censuring Mr. Trump .\nLed by Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York , a senior Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee , the censure resolution says Mr. Trump did a disservice to the country when he blamed \u201c many sides \u201d for the weekend violence .\nThe lawmakers went beyond Charlottesville , saying the president \u201c has surrounded himself with , and cultivated the influence of , senior advisers and spokespeople who have long histories of promoting white nationalist , alt-right , racist and anti-Semitic principles and policies within the country . \u201d\nThe resolution urges Mr. Trump to fire anyone who suggests he \u201c cater to the alt-right movement. \u201d It will be introduced when the House convenes on Friday .\nThe episode has motivated Democrats as much as it has deflated Republicans . Daily Action , a progressive group , claimed credit for generating \u201c thousands of calls and emails to the consumer companies on Trump \u2019 s business councils \u201d this week , focusing on Campbell \u2019 s Soup Co. and the eight others .\nOn Wednesday morning alone , the group said , it generated more than 2,500 calls to the eight companies .\nDaily Action said earlier this week that it \u201c drove : 5,227 calls to the White House urging Mr. Trump to condemn white supremacists for the violence in Charlottesville , and 4,118 constituent calls to the Senate urging lawmakers to take a stand \u201c against white supremacy in the White House \u201d and call for the resignation of White House strategist Steve Bannon .\nDemocratic National Committee spokesman Daniel Wessel said the president \u2019 s councils disbanded \u201c because of Trump \u2019 s failure to lead and the public pressure that followed . \u201d\n\u201c For American businesses and CEOs , an association with Trump has become toxic for many reasons , \u201d he said . \u201c Trump \u2019 s business and manufacturing councils were never effective in the first place and only offered as bluster to distract from his inability to deliver on his campaign promises .
