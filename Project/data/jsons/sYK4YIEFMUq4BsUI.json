For years , the architecture of the programs designed to keep us safe have been a secret to all but a few members of the intelligence community and select legislators .

But when Americans lack the most basic information about our domestic surveillance programs , they have no way of knowing whether we 're getting that balance right . This lack of transparency is a big problem .\nSince I came to the Senate , I 've been working to fix this . I 've supported amendments to the Patriot Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that would have required greater public reporting on the use of surveillance authorities and greater disclosures about the legal opinions and safeguards that support them . When those amendments failed , I voted against renewing both of these laws .\nI want to be clear : I did n't vote `` no '' because I wanted to end these programs or because I thought they were unnecessary . Based on briefings , I believe these programs protect our country and have saved lives and have reasonable safeguards in place to protect Americans ' privacy . I voted the way I did because I wanted to send a loud signal to my colleagues that transparency was critical and that there was too little of it in place .
