Billing records show that she has spent more than $ 600 on his care since his arrest , and more than $ 1,000 in outstanding bills have gone to debt collection .\nBrandon DeLaFosse with two of his three children ( Courtesy of the DeLaFosse family )\nOn Dec. 6 , 2018 , while he was in the Mobile County Metro Jail , Brandon DeLaFosse was taken to see an ear , nose and throat specialist at Providence Hospital in Mobile for a surgery follow-up visit recommended by the doctor . But first , his mother said , jail staff required her to make a payment to the doctor \u2019 s office . After the appointment , the hospital \u2019 s billing department sent a bill for $ 729 for tests he underwent that day to Alicia DeLaFosse \u2019 s house .\n\u201c The way the nurse at the jail explained it to me is because it was something that didn \u2019 t happen at the jail , it \u2019 s preexisting . ... I had to go pay for it myself , \u201d she said . \u201c For the jail to allow him to go see the doctor , I had to go to the doctor \u2019 s office and pay $ 125 first . \u201d\nA registered nurse at the jail in Mobile noted in Brandon DeLaFosse \u2019 s medical record that his mother made a payment and that the nurse had scheduled a follow-up visit for later that month . In January 2019 , a nurse practitioner at the jail wrote a note in his file stating she would request another follow-up appointment with his doctor \u201c with the expectation that it is handled in the usual fashion with his mother arranging for payment . \u201d\n`` I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s fair . They 're responsible for my medical care , so why should it be coming out of my pockets or my family 's pockets ? '' Brandon DeLaFosse said in a jailhouse phone call .\nCochran , the Mobile County sheriff , said via email that he views the situation as a \u201c legal dispute between [ Brandon DeLaFosse ] , us and our contracted provider . I know of no complaint or claim made against us . \u201d\n\u201c The mom agreed to pay [ the ] bill . Looks like she reneged , \u201d Cochran wrote . \u201c Otherwise if it would have been medically necessary our contracted folks would have handled . \u201d\nAlicia DeLaFosse said she \u201c didn \u2019 t renege \u201d and paid for all of the medical costs she knew about in advance .\nBrandon DeLaFosse continued to be billed for outside medical care after he was moved to state prison . On July 23 , nearly five months after his sentence began , he saw a doctor and underwent tests at Providence Hospital . He was sent a bill for $ 224.70 for outpatient diagnostics administered that day , plus $ 71.98 for the doctor visit .\nThat shouldn \u2019 t have happened , a spokeswoman for the Alabama Department of Corrections said in a statement .\n\u201c By ADOC \u2019 S policy , all inmates in the care , custody , and control of any ADOC correctional facility are not charged or responsible for community-based medical care or mental health services , \u201d the spokeswoman , Samantha Banks , said .\nAny state prisoners \u201c incorrectly \u201d billed for outpatient medical care should notify the provider that they were incarcerated at the time , the statement explained . \u201c The medical provider should submit to the Department the appropriate paperwork and any outstanding inmate medical bills will be directed to the appropriate payer . \u201d\nState prisoners in Arizona have reported similar issues with providers billing them directly for medical care they received while incarcerated , as KJZZ radio reported this year . Like in Alabama , the Arizona Department of Corrections has said the bills were sent out in error and that the department or its medical contractor would pay the inmates \u2019 bills .\nBut that \u2019 s a vastly different situation than the one facing inmates in some Alabama counties , where sheriff \u2019 s offices are not chalking up such bills to error and are in fact deliberately choosing to avoid paying medical bills for inmates in their charge .\nThough the public often has little sympathy for inmates , incarcerated people do have clear rights , particularly when it comes to health care behind bars .\nAlabama law states that \u201c necessary clothing and bedding must be furnished by the sheriff or jailer , at the expense of the county , to those prisoners who are unable to provide them for themselves , and also necessary medicines and medical attention to those who are sick or injured , when they are unable to provide them for themselves . \u201d\nIn another section of the state code , a definition of a county inmate includes an explicit reference to their health care being provided for : \u201c any person being held in a public institution under the administrative control and responsibility of the county sheriff and for whom the county is responsible for the provision of medical care . \u201d\nBrandon Blankenship , an assistant professor of law and ethics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham , said that allowing inmates to be billed for care that they receive while incarcerated amounts to cruel and unusual punishment and that the bills are excessive fines .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s ever been challenged in court in Alabama , but from where I \u2019 m sitting , the answer to me is that , no , it \u2019 s certainly not constitutional under the Eighth Amendment . \u201d\nThe tactics of some Alabama sheriffs stand in sharp contrast to what \u2019 s going on elsewhere in the country . This year , California and Illinois banned the practice of charging inmates copays , and a number of other states have taken , or are considering , steps to rein in the practice .\n\u201c They usually can not afford even a $ 5 copay , so the idea that they could pay thousands of dollars for these services is laughable from a practical perspective and it \u2019 s downright evil on many different levels , \u201d said Deitch , the University of Texas at Austin professor .\nIn 1983 , the U.S. Supreme Court decided a seminal case , City of Revere v. Massachusetts General Hospital , involving a person who was hurt during an arrest and taken to a hospital . The court ruled that \u201c as long as the governmental entity ensures that the medical care needed is in fact provided , the Constitution does not dictate how the cost of that care should be allocated as between the entity and the provider of the care . That is a matter of state law . \u201d\nBut that ruling did not answer the question of whether inmates can be stuck with the bill .\nRead More These Sheriffs Release Sick Inmates to Avoid Paying Their Hospital Bills Inmates suffering heart attacks , on the verge of diabetic comas and brutalized in jail beatings have been released so sheriffs wouldn \u2019 t have to pay for their medical care . Some were rearrested once they had recovered .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t have any clear Supreme Court ruling , \u201d said Fred Cohen , a professor emeritus at the University at Albany \u2019 s School of Criminal Justice who has decades of experience in corrections law and serves as executive editor of Correctional Law Reporter .\nCohen said he believes there is a good case to be made that the practice of allowing inmates to be billed for medical care violates their constitutional rights .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s an open policy question in that inmates should not be required to pay , \u201d he said . \u201c I think it could be held unconstitutional by the right court . \u201d\nSeveral days after Charles Tillman was booked into the Washington County Jail in March 2018 , his left testicle became severely inflamed . He told a guard , and on March 22 , Tillman was taken to Washington County Hospital for treatment and an ultrasound .\nThe 40-year-old , who has a long rap sheet , was driven back to the jail following the appointment and was released from the facility the following day . ( The Washington County Sheriff \u2019 s Office confirmed the dates of his incarceration . But the nature of his offense was not clear based on court records , and the sheriff \u2019 s office would not discuss his charges during a phone call with Tillman and a reporter . )\nIt wasn \u2019 t until weeks later that Tillman learned that he had been billed directly for that visit and that the debt had been sent to a collector , upending his credit . He showed AL.com and \u2588\u2588\u2588 a copy of his credit report showing it had been negatively affected by unpaid medical bills .\n\u201c They tried to get me to sign paperwork but I refused to sign it , the hospital bill saying I was responsible for it . \u201d\nAs of this month , Tillman still owed $ 1,856.42 for medical care he received at Washington County Hospital . The hospital confirmed that it treated him during each of his brief incarcerations in the jail in February 2017 , March 2018 and September 2018 .\n\u201c I got the bills at my [ home ] address , \u201d said Tillman , who has since been released . \u201c They \u2019 re on my credit report now as negative marks \u2014 that \u2019 s what \u2019 s keeping me from getting a car right now . \u201d\nWashington County Sheriff Richard Stringer was unable to explain Tillman \u2019 s situation , saying the county \u2019 s policy is to pay for all medical costs for inmates who aren \u2019 t covered by insurance .\n\u201c That \u2019 s not standard procedure , \u201d Stringer said . \u201c It would have to be an unusual case for that to happen , and I don \u2019 t keep up with every case that comes in . But no , that \u2019 s not our policy. \u201c\nHundreds of miles northeast , Rocky Harnen , chief deputy of the Jackson County Sheriff \u2019 s Office , said preexisting conditions should be inmates \u2019 responsibility .\n\u201c If it \u2019 s something preexisting , say diabetes or something , and you \u2019 ve got to go to the doctor every now and then , then that \u2019 s their responsibility to pay for that , \u201d he said .\n\u201c If it \u2019 s going to your own doctor , they would be responsible for that . I guess they would bill them at their house . The taxpayers shouldn \u2019 t be responsible for ongoing issues that are preexisting . \u201d\nHarnen referred subsequent questions about the legality of the practice to County Attorney John Porter , who did not cite any laws that allowed it .\n\u201c I can \u2019 t say that there \u2019 s not any medical care that they have to pay for , \u201d Porter said .\nAsked if inmates sometimes have to pay for outpatient care for preexisting conditions , he said , \u201c I wouldn \u2019 t say that that \u2019 s incorrect . \u2026 I can \u2019 t give you a blanket answer to that but it would be depending on the circumstances . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s not the way inmate health care works in many county jails across Alabama . In Etowah County , northeast of Birmingham , inmates are never billed for care they receive while incarcerated , according to Sheriff Jonathon Horton .\n\u201c We provide medical services for inmates in our care so they should not receive any bills , \u201d Horton said . \u201c They shouldn \u2019 t be billed . That \u2019 s my understanding . \u201d\nLauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton said that he would love to have inmates in his jail in northwest Alabama foot the bill for certain types of medical care , but that he is not legally able to do so . For instance , he said he would like to have avoided the $ 300,000 the county once had to pay for open heart surgery for \u201c the town drunk \u201d arrested on a public intoxication charge .\n\u201c If they \u2019 re in jail on public intoxication and they \u2019 ve got preexisting health conditions , I don \u2019 t think the taxpayer should have to foot the bill to pay for it , \u201d Singleton said . \u201c If they get injured inside the jail or they get sick inside the jail , we of course pay for it . But my issue is with having to pay for preexisting conditions . But we have to do it . \u201d\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 and AL.com will be investigating the extraordinary power of Alabama sheriffs all year . Are you from Alabama ? Do you have reason to believe we should be looking into your sheriff or sheriff \u2019 s office ? Get in touch .",

He was sent a bill for $224.70 for outpatient diagnostics administered that day, plus $71.98 for the doctor visit.\n\nThat shouldn\u2019t have happened, a spokeswoman for the Alabama Department of Corrections said in a statement.\n\n\u201cBy ADOC\u2019S policy, all inmates in the care, custody, and control of any ADOC correctional facility are not charged or responsible for community-based medical care or mental health services,\u201d the spokeswoman, Samantha Banks, said.\n\nAny state prisoners \u201cincorrectly\u201d billed for outpatient medical care should notify the provider that they were incarcerated at the time, the statement explained. \u201cThe medical provider should submit to the Department the appropriate paperwork and any outstanding inmate medical bills will be directed to the appropriate payer.\u201d\n\nState prisoners in Arizona have reported similar issues with providers billing them directly for medical care they received while incarcerated, as KJZZ radio reported this year. Like in Alabama, the Arizona Department of Corrections has said the bills were sent out in error and that the department or its medical contractor would pay the inmates\u2019 bills.\n\nBut that\u2019s a vastly different situation than the one facing inmates in some Alabama counties, where sheriff\u2019s offices are not chalking up such bills to error and are in fact deliberately choosing to avoid paying medical bills for inmates in their charge.\n\nConstitutional Question\n\nThough the public often has little sympathy for inmates, incarcerated people do have clear rights, particularly when it comes to health care behind bars.\n\nAlabama law states that \u201cnecessary clothing and bedding must be furnished by the sheriff or jailer, at the expense of the county, to those prisoners who are unable to provide them for themselves, and also necessary medicines and medical attention to those who are sick or injured, when they are unable to provide them for themselves.\u201d\n\nIn another section of the state code, a definition of a county inmate includes an explicit reference to their health care being provided for: \u201cany person being held in a public institution under the administrative control and responsibility of the county sheriff and for whom the county is responsible for the provision of medical care.\u201d\n\nBrandon Blankenship, an assistant professor of law and ethics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said that allowing inmates to be billed for care that they receive while incarcerated amounts to cruel and unusual punishment and that the bills are excessive fines.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever been challenged in court in Alabama, but from where I\u2019m sitting, the answer to me is that, no, it\u2019s certainly not constitutional under the Eighth Amendment.\u201d\n\nThe tactics of some Alabama sheriffs stand in sharp contrast to what\u2019s going on elsewhere in the country. This year, California and Illinois banned the practice of charging inmates copays, and a number of other states have taken, or are considering, steps to rein in the practice.\n\n\u201cThey usually cannot afford even a $5 copay, so the idea that they could pay thousands of dollars for these services is laughable from a practical perspective and it\u2019s downright evil on many different levels,\u201d said Deitch, the University of Texas at Austin professor.\n\nIn 1983, the U.S. Supreme Court decided a seminal case, City of Revere v. Massachusetts General Hospital, involving a person who was hurt during an arrest and taken to a hospital. The court ruled that \u201cas long as the governmental entity ensures that the medical care needed is in fact provided, the Constitution does not dictate how the cost of that care should be allocated as between the entity and the provider of the care. That is a matter of state law.\u201d\n\nBut that ruling did not answer the question of whether inmates can be stuck with the bill.\n\nRead More These Sheriffs Release Sick Inmates to Avoid Paying Their Hospital Bills Inmates suffering heart attacks, on the verge of diabetic comas and brutalized in jail beatings have been released so sheriffs wouldn\u2019t have to pay for their medical care. Some were rearrested once they had recovered.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any clear Supreme Court ruling,\u201d said Fred Cohen, a professor emeritus at the University at Albany\u2019s School of Criminal Justice who has decades of experience in corrections law and serves as executive editor of Correctional Law Reporter.\n\nCohen said he believes there is a good case to be made that the practice of allowing inmates to be billed for medical care violates their constitutional rights.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s an open policy question in that inmates should not be required to pay,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it could be held unconstitutional by the right court.\u201d\n\nDifferent Systems\n\nSeveral days after Charles Tillman was booked into the Washington County Jail in March 2018, his left testicle became severely inflamed. He told a guard, and on March 22, Tillman was taken to Washington County Hospital for treatment and an ultrasound.\n\nThe 40-year-old, who has a long rap sheet, was driven back to the jail following the appointment and was released from the facility the following day. (The Washington County Sheriff\u2019s Office confirmed the dates of his incarceration. But the nature of his offense was not clear based on court records, and the sheriff\u2019s office would not discuss his charges during a phone call with Tillman and a reporter.)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until weeks later that Tillman learned that he had been billed directly for that visit and that the debt had been sent to a collector, upending his credit. He showed AL.com and ProPublica a copy of his credit report showing it had been negatively affected by unpaid medical bills.\n\n\u201cThey tried to get me to sign paperwork but I refused to sign it, the hospital bill saying I was responsible for it.\u201d\n\nAs of this month, Tillman still owed $1,856.42 for medical care he received at Washington County Hospital. The hospital confirmed that it treated him during each of his brief incarcerations in the jail in February 2017, March 2018 and September 2018.\n\n\u201cI got the bills at my [home] address,\u201d said Tillman, who has since been released. \u201cThey\u2019re on my credit report now as negative marks \u2014 that\u2019s what\u2019s keeping me from getting a car right now.\u201d\n\nWashington County Sheriff Richard Stringer was unable to explain Tillman\u2019s situation, saying the county\u2019s policy is to pay for all medical costs for inmates who aren\u2019t covered by insurance.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not standard procedure,\u201d Stringer said. \u201cIt would have to be an unusual case for that to happen, and I don\u2019t keep up with every case that comes in. But no, that\u2019s not our policy.\u201c\n\nHundreds of miles northeast, Rocky Harnen, chief deputy of the Jackson County Sheriff\u2019s Office, said preexisting conditions should be inmates\u2019 responsibility.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s something preexisting, say diabetes or something, and you\u2019ve got to go to the doctor every now and then, then that\u2019s their responsibility to pay for that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s going to your own doctor, they would be responsible for that. I guess they would bill them at their house. The taxpayers shouldn\u2019t be responsible for ongoing issues that are preexisting.\u201d\n\nHarnen referred subsequent questions about the legality of the practice to County Attorney John Porter, who did not cite any laws that allowed it.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say that there\u2019s not any medical care that they have to pay for,\u201d Porter said.\n\nAsked if inmates sometimes have to pay for outpatient care for preexisting conditions, he said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that that\u2019s incorrect. \u2026 I can\u2019t give you a blanket answer to that but it would be depending on the circumstances.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not the way inmate health care works in many county jails across Alabama. In Etowah County, northeast of Birmingham, inmates are never billed for care they receive while incarcerated, according to Sheriff Jonathon Horton.\n\n\u201cWe provide medical services for inmates in our care so they should not receive any bills,\u201d Horton said. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be billed. That\u2019s my understanding.\u201d\n\nLauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton said that he would love to have inmates in his jail in northwest Alabama foot the bill for certain types of medical care, but that he is not legally able to do so. For instance, he said he would like to have avoided the $300,000 the county once had to pay for open heart surgery for \u201cthe town drunk\u201d arrested on a public intoxication charge.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re in jail on public intoxication and they\u2019ve got preexisting health conditions, I don\u2019t think the taxpayer should have to foot the bill to pay for it,\u201d Singleton said. \u201cIf they get injured inside the jail or they get sick inside the jail, we of course pay for it. But my issue is with having to pay for preexisting conditions. But we have to do it.\u201d\n\nHelp Us Investigate\n\nProPublica and AL.com will be investigating the extraordinary power of Alabama sheriffs all year. Are you from Alabama?
