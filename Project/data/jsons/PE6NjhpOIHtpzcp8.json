    "content": "The Justice Department 's No . 2 on Monday acknowledged that when it comes to the showdown over Operation Fast and Furious , the ball is now in Republicans ' court .\n`` It 's up to the House to initiate it , we 'll see what they do , '' said Deputy Attorney General James Cole , one day after House Speaker John Boehner vowed that House Republicans would be filing a civil suit in federal court in an effort to force the Justice Department to turn over documents related to Fast and Furious .\n`` It needs to happen , '' Boehner said Sunday . `` The American people deserve the truth . ''\nOn Monday , Cole would not say if the Justice Department is already preparing for battle in federal court , insisting only that `` once litigation is initiated , we 'll respond . '' It was his first comment on the case since he wrote a letter to Boehner last week making clear the department would shield Holder from criminal prosecution .\nLast week , House Republicans -- and even many Democrats -- voted to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in both criminal and civil contempt of Congress for failing to give congressional investigators documents in response to a subpoena last year . Meetings in the run-up to the vote failed to reach a compromise , after President Obama asserted executive privilege over the documents .\n`` I think the first thing you need to realize is the documents that are at issue are not the documents concerning the actual Fast and Furious investigation , '' Cole said Monday . `` All of those -- other than sensitive law enforcement documents -- were turned over . These are just documents that occurred well after the fact . ''\nSpecifically , the documents at issue are mostly composed of internal Justice Department emails after Feb. 4 , 2011 , when department officials realized they would have to retract a letter to Congress that denied Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives agents ever let guns fall into the hands of suspected criminals .\n`` They concern internal communications in the Justice Department about how we would be responding to the congressional questions , and that 's all , '' Cole said of the documents . `` These are things we offered , frankly , in an accommodation to try and give to Congress in return for just having it satisfy the subpoena . ''\nIn one email from early 2011 , described to Fox News , Holder told subordinates : `` We need answers on this . Not defensive BS . Real answers . '' The email was among several shown in two separate meetings with House Republicans and Democrats last week .\nFor more than a year , Republicans have been leading an investigation into Fast and Furious , which was launched in Arizona in late 2009 by ATF , with help from the U.S. attorney 's office there . The operation 's targets bought nearly 2,000 weapons over several months . But for reasons that are still in dispute , most of the weapons sold were never followed , and high-powered weapons tied to the investigation ended up at crime scenes in Mexico and the United States , including the December 2010 murder of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry .\nThe chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , Rep. Darrell , R-Calif. , has said it is `` critically important '' to obtain the post-Feb. 4 , 2011 , documents at issue because , among other things , they could show whether top officials were `` surprised or were already aware '' about so-called `` gunwalking '' in Fast and Furious when confronted with new information . In essence , Republicans say the documents could show whether the false letter was part of a `` cover-up . ''\nIn a hearing before Thursday 's contempt votes , Issa insisted Holder offered `` to provide subpoenaed documents only if the committee agrees in advance to close the investigation , '' adding , `` No investigator would ever agree to that . ''\nBut Justice Department officials have disputed that account , as Cole did again Monday , saying , `` We never asked them to stop their investigation . ''\nA Justice Department official insisted last week the documents at issue `` show no intention or attempt to conceal information or mislead ( Congress ) . ''\nNevertheless , Boehner said Sunday that a civil lawsuit to obtain the documents `` would be coming in the next several weeks . ''\nDays earlier , Cole informed Boehner in a letter that the Justice Department had `` determined that the Attorney General 's respond to the subpoena ... does not constitute a crime , and therefore the Department will not bring the congressional contempt citation before a grand jury or take any other action to prosecute the Attorney General . ''\nThat left a civil lawsuit in federal court as the Republicans ' best option , and it 's unclear how a federal judge would rule .\n`` The American people have a right to know what happened here , '' Boehner said Sunday on CBS ' `` Face the Nation . '' `` Brian Terry 's family has a right to know what happened here . And the fact is , is that the only facts that we 've received about this entire Fast and Furious operation came from whistleblowers and others associated with it . ''\nIn fact , the Justice Department has turned over more than 7,600 documents , a small fraction of the 80,000 documents identified as responsive to the House subpoena .\nAccording to the publicly available documents , at least twice in 2010 a top federal prosecutor in Phoenix told U.S. Attorney Dennis Burke in memos that ATF agents `` have pursued interdiction of the firearms transferred to the conspirators where possible , '' and that agents `` have not purposely let guns 'walk . ' ''\nAfter allegations saying otherwise surfaced in late January 2011 , Burke told department officials in Washington that whistleblower claims of `` gunwalking '' were `` categorically false . ''\nDays later , on Feb. 4 , 2011 , the Justice Department sent its letter to Congress , saying , `` ATF makes every effort to interdict weapons that have been purchased illegally and prevent their transportation to Mexico . ''\nBut within a month , Holder directed the Justice Department 's inspector general to launch its own investigation . And months after that , the department retracted the letter .",
