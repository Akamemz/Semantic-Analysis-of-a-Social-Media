    "content": "The ideals gaining force during the Revolutionary era also inspired Northern states from Vermont to Pennsylvania to pass laws gradually ending slavery . These laws did not prescribe full and immediate emancipation : They freed the children of enslaved mothers only after the children served their mothers \u2019 enslavers through their early 20s . Nor did they promise racial equality or full citizenship for African Americans\u2014far from it . But black activism during the Revolutionary War and this era of emancipation led to the end of slavery earlier than prescribed in such laws . Enslaved black people negotiated with their owners to purchase their freedom , or simply ran away in the confused aftermath of war . And most Northern enslavers freed slaves ahead of the time mandated by law .\nAmong Northern\u2014and even some Southern\u2014white people , the push to end slavery during this time was real . The new nation almost faltered over the degree to which the Constitution supported the institution . In the end , Northern Colonies conceded a number of points to the protection of slavery on the federal level , even as the Constitution also pledged to end the trans-Atlantic slave trade by 1807\u2014all without once using the word \u201c slave. \u201d The degree to which the document was intended to provide for the protection or the destruction of slavery was hotly contested in the antebellum era . While Frederick Douglass may have seen the Constitution as an anti-slavery document , both radical abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison and pro-slavery ideologue John C.

Gradual emancipation laws , as well as a range of state and local laws across the antebellum nation limiting black suffrage , property ownership , access to education and even residency in places like Ohio , Washington and California , together demonstrate that legally , the struggle for black equality almost always took a back seat to the oppressive imperatives of white supremacy .

By the time Gordon Wood and Sean Wilentz were publishing their first , highly acclaimed books on pre-Civil War America , in the early 1970s and mid-1980s , respectively , academic historians had begun , finally , to acknowledge African American history and slavery as a critical theme in American history .

In his first book , Chants Democratic ( 1984 ) , Wilentz sought to explain how New York \u2019 s antebellum-era working class took up republican ideals , which had been used by some Founding Fathers to limit citizenship , and rewrote the tenets to include themselves as full-fledged citizens . Yet Wilentz \u2019 s work largely ignored issues of race and black workers , even though New York had the largest population of enslaved black people in the Colonial North , the second-largest population of free black people in the antebellum urban North , and was the site of the most violent race riots of the 19th century .

( The truth , obviously , is somewhere in between . ) In The Radicalism of the American Revolution ( 1991 ) , Wood acknowledges the new nation \u2019 s failure to end slavery , and even the brutality of some Founding Fathers who held people as property . But the facts of slave-owning are not presented as central to that time . While he discusses the Founders \u2019 ability to eliminate other forms of hierarchy , Wood has no explanation for why they were unable to eliminate slavery ; nor does he discuss how or why Northern states did so .

In a 2015 op-ed , and more fully in his 2018 book No Property in Man , he argues that the Constitutional Convention specifically kept support for slavery defined as \u201c property in man \u201d out of the Constitution , a key distinction that the Founders believed would eventually allow for ending slavery in the nation . Such an argument obscures the degree to which many Founding Fathers returned to a support of Southern slavery as the revolutionary fervor waned ; by the early 19th century , as only one example , Thomas Jefferson established the University of Virginia in part as a pro-slavery bulwark against Northern anti-slavery ideologies .\nFortunately , the works of Wood and Wilentz and others who underrepresent the centrality of slavery and African Americans to America \u2019 s history are only one strand of a vibrant scholarship on early America .
