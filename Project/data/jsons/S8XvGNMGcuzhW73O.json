    "content": "Republican leaders in Congress have been hesitant to raise tax rates on anyone because the party \u2019 s brand is largely built around the idea that the economy does best when people have more money to spend . Yet they may have no choice : Senator Susan Collins , Republican of Maine , said this week that she opposed lowering the top tax rate for individuals earning more than $ 1 million , creating pressure for Republicans to include a higher bracket in order to win passage .\nRepublican lawmakers are selling their plan as a middle-class tax cut , and the bill is expected to create three income tax brackets \u2014 12 percent , 25 percent and 35 percent \u2014 and call for doubling the standard deduction . Yet lawmakers are considering making these changes temporary , so they would expire after 10 years .\nThe conventional wisdom is that a future Congress will vote to continue the cuts and not allow them to expire . But that \u2019 s a tricky assumption given their cost , which will only exacerbate a federal deficit already on an upward trajectory . The Treasury Department said the deficit for the fiscal year 2017 grew by $ 80 billion , to $ 666 billion . Federal debt , which has already topped $ 20 trillion , is expected to grow by an additional $ 10 trillion over the next decade , according to the Congressional Budget Office .\nCompounding the math problem is that the plan would probably make the corporate tax cuts permanent . Lawmakers argue that a permanent cut , to 20 percent from today \u2019 s 35 percent rate , is needed to trigger the economic growth they anticipate , and they say it will ultimately put more money into workers \u2019 pockets .\nStill , those corporate tax cuts are expected to cost $ 2 trillion over the next decade and , to help make the budget work , lawmakers are discussing phasing in the corporate tax cut over several years to get to the 20 percent rate . The White House on Monday seemed to suggest that was a nonstarter .\nThe original framework called for repealing the estate tax , which would reduce federal revenues by $ 239 billion over a decade .\nEstates are taxed at a rate of 40 percent , but the first $ 5.49 million of an inheritance is exempt from taxation .
