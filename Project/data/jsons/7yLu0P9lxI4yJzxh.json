    "content": "The Obama administration has a tough sell convincing Congress to grant it \u201c fast track \u201d trade negotiating authority so it can complete negotiations on the biggest regional trade deal in United States history \u2013 the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement , involving a total of 12 nations ( though not China ) .\nThe administration sees this as a tremendous opportunity for economic growth . It wants fast track \u2013 which would require Congress only an up-or-down vote on a final agreement \u2013 to help it secure the best deal it can . Opponents , mostly Democrats but some Republicans , too , say fast track and TPP will cost America jobs . But supporters say their approach is \u201c new and improved . \u201d\nBelow are some of the critics \u2019 chief concerns , and how fast track and TPP supporters respond :\nCritics say free trade kills jobs . Business says it creates them . However , it \u2019 s not that simple .\nMost economists agree that broadening trade results in economic growth , but benefits are shared unevenly .\n\u201c Trade liberalization promotes overall economic growth among trading partners but \u2026 there are both winners and losers , \u201d the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in an April 2015 report . It \u2019 s also extremely difficult to calculate how a trade deal affects job creation and loss \u201c due to a lack of data and important theoretical and practical matters , \u201d CRS said .\nIn reviewing the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement , CRS found that `` NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters . ''\nThe Obama White House admits that while the overall benefits of trade expansion \u201c may be large \u201d they may also be \u201c unevenly distributed. \u201d Trade , therefore , \u201c can also have adverse effects for some workers \u201d the Council of Economic Advisers ( CEA ) said in \u201c The Economic Benefits of US Trade , \u201d a report issued earlier this month .\nSo the White House is arguing to members of Congress that policies the administration supports , such as investment in infrastructure , worker training , and education , can offset jobs lost as a result of trade deals .\nTrade adjustment assistance ( TAA ) programs provide help beyond traditional jobless benefits for workers displaced by trade . Displaced workers get help to train for a new career . Without such extra help , the thinking goes , these workers might find new jobs but have to take a big cut in pay \u2013 or they might drop out of the job market entirely .\nThe programs are also designed to boost chances of passing trade legislation , drawing in some Democrats who might otherwise be in the `` no '' camp . In a separate bill , TAA has been beefed up to raise benefits and to include service sector workers for the first time .\nWhether TAA works , however , is a matter of debate . One 2012 Labor Department study found that , after four years , participants had earnings comparable to a group of non-TAA job losers .\nThat can be viewed as bad news ( even with the help , they are n't doing any better than other people recovering from joblessness ) . Or as good news ( this is a particularly hard-hit group of workers , who might have fared worse without the training ) .\nPolitically , \u201c If TAA made even a relatively modest contribution to the ease of enacting free-trade policies , the program \u2019 s benefits would outweigh its costs , '' said the report .\nWhen countries such as China and Japan artificially lower the value of their currencies , it costs Americans jobs because foreign imports become cheaper and US exports more expensive . So critics want language in the fast-track bill against currency manipulation .\nThe bill \u2019 s supporters don \u2019 t dispute the dangers . That \u2019 s why , for the first time , fast-track legislation makes the issue a \u201c negotiating objective \u201d for the administration .\nBut an enforcement mechanism is too strong a remedy to include in the bill , the administration says , claiming that it would derail trade negotiations . It could also endanger America \u2019 s ability to manage its own currency , and lead to retaliation and trade wars , US officials say . They point to modest success in recent years in pressuring China to increase the value of its currency .\nSen. Charles Schumer ( D ) of New York , who calls currency manipulation the \u201c most significant trade challenge this country faces , \u201d succeeded in getting a currency amendment in a related customs bill . It \u2019 s not yet clear what will happen to this measure or other attempts to address the issue .\nDon \u2019 t know what \u2019 s in the TPP ? That \u2019 s because it \u2019 s \u201c top secret , \u201d criticizes Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D ) of Massachusetts , a vocal opponent of fast track .\nThat was a complaint that her colleague , Sen. Ron Wyden ( D ) of Oregon heard a lot at town halls . As a result , \u201c I really went to the mat on these secrecy issues , \u201d Senator Wyden said at a recent Monitor breakfast .\nSenator Wyden , who is the administration \u2019 s point man on trade in the Senate , points out that with the fast-track bill , the full text of the TPP and any other trade agreements will be public for the first time \u2013 60 days before Congress starts voting on it . Under fast track , any member of Congress can have access to classified negotiating texts . Members can attend negotiating rounds or be briefed by the administration on request .\nThat \u2019 s not good enough for Senator Warren . She \u2019 s pushing a petition that tells US trade officials : \u201c No vote on a fast-track for trade agreements until the American people can see what \u2019 s in this TPP deal. \u201d Members of Congress also complain about restricted access for their staffs , on whom they heavily rely .\nCritics are up in arms over the way corporations settle disputes over alleged violations of free-trade agreements . The investor-state dispute settlement , or ISDS , lets foreign countries sue governments in special tribunals , rather than going through the country \u2019 s court system .\nThe problem with this , they argue , is that the tribunals grant huge payments to corporations for the violations \u2013 such big payments that countries are then incentivized to change their regulations . Not only do supporters of labor object , they worry that foreign companies will use the tribunals to force changes in US regulations and laws .\nThe administration says it is writing safeguards into the TPP that will prevent this from happening .\nPresident Obama also told Yahoo Politics : `` There is no chance , zero chance , that the US would be sued on something like our financial regulations , and on food safety , and on the various environmental regulations that we have in place , mainly because we treat everybody the same .
