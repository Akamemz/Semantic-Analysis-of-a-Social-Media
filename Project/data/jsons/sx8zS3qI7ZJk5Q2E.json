Mazur , assistant secretary for tax policy at the Treasury , said the goal was to give businesses more time to comply with the rules , though opponents said it was an acknowledgment of a looming disaster .\nThe delay is to the mandate requiring businesses with more than 50 workers to offer insurance to all full-time employees , or else pay a fine of $ 2,000 per worker .
