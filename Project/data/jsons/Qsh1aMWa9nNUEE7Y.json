    "content": "I ended up in that particular Starbucks by accident , really . I \u2019 m glad I did , because a homeless woman taught me a valuable lesson about Christmas .\nIt was a few weeks ago and I had just finished catching up with one of my good friends over breakfast on the east side of New York City . We started walking to his office building , and as we did we strolled past the Starbucks . It seemed like the perfect place to park myself for the next two hours and work before I had to go to the airport .\nMy friend and I parted ways , and I dodged the trendy business suits holding their red cups and started looking for a seat . There was one open . Yes , I thought . Winning .\nAcross from the open seat was a homeless man , mouth gaped open and a pea-sized amount of foamy saliva pooling at the corner of his lips . At any minute , gravity was going to win . He had his once-white socks pulled up over the outside of his sweatpants , and a tattered , black jacket with the hood pulled over the top of his head . He repositioned himself , and I caught a glimpse of days-old scruff that was clinging to remnants of what was likely someone else \u2019 s discarded meal .\nI lived in New York City for six years . This type of scene isn \u2019 t new or abnormal for me . It \u2019 s life in the city . So I grabbed the seat .\nI worked as the man slept . Tap , tap , tap on my keyboard . He barely flinched . People came and went . Baristas called out wrong names . Two hours later , he and I were the longest-tenured inhabitants , besides the employees behind the counter .\nThat \u2019 s when I caught a glimpse of an L.L . Bean-type man , a canvas messenger bagged draped over his shoulder .\n\u201c Sir . Sir ! SIR ! \u201d He tried to wake the homeless man up , but nothing happened . He never touched him , just leaned in close . After a few unsuccessful attempts , he walked off .\nFive minutes later , it happened again , but this time it was a small woman dressed in a Starbucks uniform . She approached the homeless man from the front , gently placing her hand on his knee .\n\u201c Sir . Sir ! \u201d His head finally moved . \u201c You can \u2019 t be here anymore . You need to leave . \u201d\nShe walked toward the man who had tried to do the same thing earlier and they began talking about inventory and product placement as they toured the store . A regional manager of some sort , I assumed .\nAt this point you \u2019 re probably wondering why I keep talking about a homeless man when I teased a lesson from a homeless woman . Well , here \u2019 s where she comes in .\nBehind the homeless man , a disheveled woman in a grimy flannel had sidled her way up to the counter and taken a sideways seat on a stool . A red cart loaded with her possessions stood as a sentry . As she sat there , she put one elbow on the counter and rested her head on her hand , staring up at an angle like a teenage girl daydreaming about her crush .\nAs the man began stirring , he reached in his pocket and pulled out a yellow iPhone . It must have been charged and operational , because he did something on it for about three minutes . I could see about five sets of eyes cast glances . That \u2019 s when it happened .\n\u201c Sir . Sir. \u201d The homeless woman from the counter was trying to get the man \u2019 s attention . He reluctantly looked up . \u201c Would you like a cup of coffee ? \u201d\nWhat ? I thought to myself .
