Mr. Cruz , Mr. Paul and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan , the 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee , have campaigned and raised money tirelessly for their party \u2019 s 2014 candidates .\nBut the early 2016 GOP field has three candidates in Mr. Paul , Mr. Cruz and Dr. Carson whose appeal has been built on being Washington outsiders willing to buck , shun and even ridicule the establishment in Washington . The art of collecting chits and hiring staffers can , at times , run contrary to those storylines .\nMr. Paul , for instance , was forced early this year to throw his support behind fellow Kentuckian Mitch McConnell in a tough Senate primary against a more conservative challenger , and later in Mr. McConnell \u2019 s re-election race against Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes .
