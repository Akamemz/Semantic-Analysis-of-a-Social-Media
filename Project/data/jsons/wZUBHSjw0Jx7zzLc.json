    "content": "At birth , you are given a pair of binoculars that see black life from a distance , never with the texture of intimacy . Those binoculars are privilege ; they are status , regardless of your class . In fact the greatest privilege that exists is for white folk to get stopped by a cop and not end up dead when the encounter is over .\nThose binoculars are also stories , bad stories , biased stories , harmful stories , about how black people are lazy , or dumb , or slick , or immoral , people who can \u2019 t be helped by the best schools or even God himself . These beliefs don \u2019 t make it into contemporary books , or into most classrooms . But they are passed down , informally , from one white mind to the next .\nThe problem is you do not want to know anything different from what you think you know . Your knowledge of black life , of the hardships we face , yes , those we sometimes create , those we most often endure , don \u2019 t concern you much . You think we have been handed everything because we have fought your selfish insistence that the world , all of it \u2014 all its resources , all its riches , all its bounty , all its grace \u2014 should be yours first , and foremost , and if there \u2019 s anything left , why then we can have some , but only if we ask politely and behave gratefully .\nSo you demand the Supreme Court give you back what was taken from you : more space in college classrooms that you dominate ; better access to jobs in fire departments and police forces that you control . All the while your resentment builds , and your slow hate gathers steam . Your whiteness has become a burden too heavy for you to carry , so you outsource it to a vile political figure who amplifies your most detestable private thoughts .\nWhiteness is blindness . It is the wish not to see what it will not know .\nIf you do not know us , you also refuse to hear us because you do not believe what we say . You have decided that enough is enough . If the cops must kill us for no good reason , then so be it because most of us are guilty anyway . If the black person that they kill turns out to be innocent , it is an acceptable death , a sacrificial one .\nTerror was visited on Dallas Thursday night . Unspeakable terror . We are not strangers to terror . You make us afraid to walk the streets , for at any moment , a blue-clad officer with a gun could swoop down on us to snatch our lives from us and say that it was because we were selling cigarettes , or compact discs , or breathing too much for your comfort , or speaking too abrasively for your taste . Or running , or standing still , or talking back , or being silent , or doing as you say , or not doing as you say fast enough .\nYou hold an entire population of Muslims accountable for the evil acts of a few . Yet you rarely muster the courage to put down your binoculars , and with them , your corrosive self-pity , and see what we see . You say religions and cultures breed violence stoked by the complicity of silence because peoples will not denounce the villains who act in their names .",
