    "content": "Columbia , South Carolina ( CNN ) Donald Trump acknowledged Thursday that he `` could have '' signaled support for invading Iraq during a 2002 interview with Howard Stern .\n`` It was probably the first time I was asked that question , '' the GOP presidential front-runner told CNN 's Anderson Cooper during a South Carolina town hall . `` By the time the war started , I was against the war . ''\nHe also noted he `` was n't a politician '' at the time of the interview .\nAhead of Saturday 's South Carolina Republican primary , Trump has repeatedly blasted former President George W. Bush for launching the war .\nBut Buzzfeed posted Thursday Trump 's interview with Stern , given on the first anniversary following the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terror attacks . When asked whether he would support an invasion , Trump responded : `` Yeah , I guess so . ''\n`` You know , I wish the first time it was done correctly , '' he added in the interview .\nTrump 's criticism of the war could be a risky move in this military-dominated state . One man in the audience confronted Trump for saying that Bush had lied about the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .\n`` I would probably say that something was going on , '' Trump said . `` I do n't know why he went in '' to Iraq .\nTrump called Pope Francis a `` wonderful guy '' after the pontiff said Thursday the candidate is `` not Christian '' if he wants to deport undocumented immigrants and build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border .\n`` I do n't think this is a fight , '' Trump said . `` I think he said something much softer than was originally reported by the media .

''\nBush , who is a devout Catholic , did n't criticize the Pope 's comments . But he said he personally would n't `` question people 's Christianity . ''\n`` I think that 's a relationship they have with their Lord and savior and themselves . So I just do n't think it 's appropriate to question Donald Trump 's faith , '' Bush said . `` He knows what his faith is . ''\nTrump , who is dominating most South Carolina polls , continued to pound his closest competitor : Ted Cruz .\nThe billionaire businessman said the Texas senator `` has a problem with the truth . ''\nTrump appeared to side with Marco Rubio after the Florida senator 's campaign accused Cruz 's team earlier Thursday of photoshopping an image to make it appear as though Rubio is shaking hands with President Barack Obama .\n`` They even made Marco a lot shorter than he is , '' Trump said , adding that this was `` probably the thing that bothered him the most . ''\nHe quipped that other tactics the Cruz campaign has used in this election were `` disgusting . ''\nTrump has confounded many political observers with his propensity for colorful , unfiltered and inflammatory language as a candidate . When Cooper asked whether he would take on a different tone as president , Trump suggested he could easily switch back and forth between being politically correct -- and not .\n`` I can be more politically correct than anybody you 've ever interviewed , '' Trump said .\nHe added : `` I can do whatever I want . ... I deal with society . Society loves me . ''\nTrump also shed light on his habits on the road , including his propensity to consume fast food from big chains like McDonald 's and Burger King .\n`` I 'm a very clean person . I like cleanliness , '' he said . `` And I think you 're better off going there than maybe some place where you have no idea where the food is coming from .

At a forum in Clemson earlier in the day , a tearful young man confessed to Kasich that after suffering personal losses , he had gone through a very dark period in life . Now , he had found hope in the message that Kasich was taking to voters , he said , prompting the governor to hug the man .\n`` There are a lot of people out there who are lonely , '' Kasich told Cooper . `` Could you believe that young man ?
