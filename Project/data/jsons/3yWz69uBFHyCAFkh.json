The House GOP's historic implosion McCarthy's stunning move leaves the House with no apparent line of succession to power.\n\nHouse Republicans are in a historic state of chaos, torn between two ideological poles with no clear sense of who will serve as their next leader, and no idea of their governing agenda with several legislative battles in the coming weeks.\n\nCalifornia Rep.

He thought he would win the speakership, but be crippled by the same problems that dogged Speaker John Boehner. He said Republicans created the Select Committee on Benghazi to harm Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances of winning the presidency, which alarmed Republicans.\n\nNow, the party is searching for a new answer.\n\nThe general consensus inside the House Republican Conference is that there is just one man standing who can garner the 218 votes needed to be speaker: Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan. He has resisted calls to run in the past, but the top two Republicans \u2014 Boehner and McCarthy \u2014 have asked him to reconsider. He has canceled his fundraising appearances for the next 48 hours, and is considering a bid.\n\nRepublicans are floating the names of other lawmakers, including Reps. Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia, Mike Conaway and Bill Flores of Texas, John Kline of Minnesota and Tom Cole of Oklahoma. Some of these men \u2014 most notably the retiring Kline \u2014 have been mentioned as caretakers of the office until after the 2016 elections. Reps.

Boehner canceled an appearance on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\u201d after McCarthy withdrew from consideration.\n\nThe chaos harkens to another dark time for Republicans. In Dec. 1998, during the impeachment proceedings of President Bill Clinton, Louisiana Rep. Bob Livingston plunged the House into chaos by admitting to extramarital affairs, and resigning from Congress. Livingston was speaker designate, slated to take the job from the outgoing Newt Gingrich. The admission stunned Capitol Hill, and the country.\n\nRep. Tom Delay of Texas, then majority whip, sensed an opportunity, and rallied his vote-counting operation behind Rep. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.). Within a matter of hours, while other Republicans hesitated to run for speaker, DeLay lined up the votes for Hastert. The race was over before the other hopefuls could organize. Hastert helped soothe the battered Republican Conference. To this day, he is the longest-serving Republican speaker.\n\nSeventeen years later, the Republicans need a soothing force once again. And that process will begin Friday morning, when the party retreats to a room in the Capitol basement for a special GOP conference meeting.

The bloc of roughly 40 Republicans endorsed Webster Wednesday, and vowed to vote together in the closed party election.\n\nThat was a key moment for McCarthy, demonstrating to him how difficult the contest would have been, he said. For a period of time, McCarthy considered forcing Republicans to vote in an open ballot to show he could get the 218 votes needed to win the speakership on the floor.\n\nInstead, he stepped down.\n\n",
