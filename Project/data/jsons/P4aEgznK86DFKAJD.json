The letter went public - and Mrs Clinton says it handed Donald Trump the election .\nOn 6 November , the FBI said it had completed its review into the new trove of emails and there would , again , be no charges .\nOnce Mr Trump became president , Mr Comey says he tried to extract a pledge of personal loyalty from him - something the president fiercely denies .\nIn March 2017 , when alleged links between Mr Trump 's campaign and Russia were being investigated by the FBI , Mr Trump allegedly pressured Mr Comey to publicly declare that the president was not personally being investigated - something the then director says he declined to do .\nSome Democrats blamed Mr Comey for costing Mrs Clinton the election , while Trump supporters felt he was targeting the president with the Russia investigation .\nBefore revealing the new Clinton investigation , one staff member asked Mr Comey : `` Should you consider that what you 're about do to may help elect Donald Trump president ?
