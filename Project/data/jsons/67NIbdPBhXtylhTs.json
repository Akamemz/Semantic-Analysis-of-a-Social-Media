    "content": "An estimated 6 million guns have been sold since the coronavirus outbreak began in March , as May marked the third consecutive month of record-high sales .\nMore than 1.7 million guns were sold in May 2020 , according to an analysis by Small Arms Analytics & Forecasting . That is an all-time record for the month and an 80 percent increase from 2019 . The spike in sales comes as rioting grips the nation and the coronavirus continues to dominate headlines . Jurgen Brauer , the group 's chief economist , called the trend `` unprecedented . ''\n`` Firearms sales have surged in unprecedented ways , '' he said in a statement . `` The boom in handgun sales has been particularly noticeable in recent months . ''\nMay is typically the slowest month of gun sales in the spring , but 2020 's record-setting monthly figures were down only slightly from April 's 1.8 million and March 's 2.5 million\u2014the highest sales total ever recorded in a single month . Most surprising to observers is the fact that May 2020 saw more sales than both March and April of 2019 . The record-setting sales pace has been driven in large part by new gun owners , according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation , the gun industry 's trade group .\n`` Our recent survey of firearm retailers shows us that 40 percent of these gun buyers are buying a firearm for the first time , '' Mark Oliva , a spokesman for the group , said in a statement . `` Of those first-time gun owners , 40 percent are women and these buyers are overwhelmingly purchasing handguns for personal protection . ''\nThe sales came as the death toll from the coronavirus rose to over 100,000 , unemployment soared to over 20 percent , and rioting swept the country in response to the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer . The influx of new gun owners has the potential to change the politics surrounding gun laws in America .
