    "content": "Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper made a startling break with President Trump on Wednesday , saying he opposes the use of active-duty troops to help quell nationwide protests while putting clear distance between himself and the White House as questions grow about the Pentagon \u2019 s role in the crisis .\nMr. Esper made the comments amid withering criticism from lawmakers and retired officers who said the Pentagon chief has allowed the military to be drawn into a fierce political debate . Bucking the president raises questions about how long he will remain in his post . The White House was noncommittal about his future .\n\u201c As of right now , Secretary Esper is still Secretary Esper , \u201d White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters . \u201c If the president loses faith , we will all learn about that in the future . \u201d\nDays after Mr. Trump said he was strongly leaning toward using the military to restore order in Washington and other cities , Mr. Esper told a Pentagon briefing that \u201c the option to use active-duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used as a matter of last resort and only in the most urgent and dire of situations . \u201d\n\u201c We are not in one of those situations now , \u201d he said .\nPentagon leaders mulled whether to send roughly 1,600 troops dispatched to Washington back to their home bases in New York and North Carolina . There were conflicting reports late Wednesday on whether the troop redeployments began . Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy told The Associated Press that some 200 troops from the 82nd Airborne Division scheduled to leave were staying in the Washington area for now .\nMr. Esper \u2019 s blunt words also underscored the delicate balance he must strike as the leader of a diverse military force with top leaders who are taking increasingly public stands against systemic racism and injustice after the death last week of George Floyd , a black man , during a confrontation with Minneapolis police .\nThe defense chief , a former defense industry official deeply familiar with the world of Washington politics , sought to keep his department out of the line of fire from the chain of events outside the White House on Monday night .\nMr. Esper said National Guard forces did not use tear gas or rubber bullets as widely reported . He insisted he played no role in the decision to aggressively disband protesters minutes ahead of the president \u2019 s extraordinary walk across Lafayette Square to pose with a Bible in front of the historic , riot-damaged St. John \u2019 s Church .\nBut he also acknowledged that he was aware of Mr. Trump \u2019 s destination when the walk began .\n\u201c I did know \u2026 that many of us were going to join President Trump and review damage at Lafayette Park and at St. John \u2019 s Episcopal Church , \u201d Mr. Esper told reporters . \u201c What I was not aware of was exactly where we were going when we arrived at the church , and what the plans were once we got there . \u201d\nMr. Esper said he personally ordered an investigation to determine who gave the green light for a National Guard helicopter to fly low over a crowd of demonstrators as an intimidation tactic , and he expressed regret over his widely criticized use of the term \u201c battlespace \u201d in a phone call with U.S. governors this week to describe city streets gripped by protests , riots and looting .\nBut the secretary made his strongest comments when he discussed Mr. Trump \u2019 s threat to invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act and the role of active-duty forces in a simmering domestic dispute .\n\u201c I do not support invoking the Insurrection Act , \u201d he said at one point . \u201c I do everything I can to stay apolitical . \u201d\nThe very suggestion sparked a roiling debate in military circles . Two retired former heads of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \u2014 Adm. Michael Mullen and Gen. Martin Dempsey \u2014 raised doubts about the wisdom of employing the military to keep order .\nAdm. Mullen , writing this week in The Atlantic , raised the stakes with a direct questioning of Mr. Trump \u2019 s leadership .\nThe admiral said he was confident that the men and women in uniform \u201c will obey lawful orders . \u2026 I am less confident in the orders they will be given by this commander in chief . \u201d\nGen. Dempsey wrote in a Twitter post that \u201c America is not a battleground . Our fellow citizens are not the enemy. \u201d Retired Gen. Michael V. Hayden , former director of the CIA and NSA , told CNN in an interview Wednesday that Mr. Esper \u201c didn \u2019 t do enough \u201d to keep the military out of the political dogfight .\nMr. Trump has not formally followed through with his threat to use the 1807 law . National Guard troops are active in dozens of states across the country to assist law enforcement , but no active-duty forces have been mobilized other than in the Washington area , where Army troops were placed on standby at bases outside the District of Columbia .\nEven some leading Republicans , such as Gov . Greg Abbott of Texas , said they had no interest in seeing active-duty forces patrol the streets in their states .\nBut Mr. Esper \u2019 s statement Wednesday is unlikely to be the last word on the controversy , Pentagon watchers said .\n\u201c Distancing himself from POTUS , and clarifying that he wasn \u2019 t aware what POTUS was going to ask of him , is not only surreal but also suggests SECDEF and POTUS aren \u2019 t in [ sync ] .
