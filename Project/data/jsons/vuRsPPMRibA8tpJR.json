''\nThe White House claimed there was a `` broad consensus '' across the federal government , from the Department of Defense , the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security , to prosecute OBL 's son-in-law in civilian court .\n`` The intelligence community agrees that the best way to protect our national security interests is to prosecute Abu Ghaith in an Article III court , '' Principal Deputy White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters today .\n`` We 're able to question him as a part of the regular process in detaining individuals like this , but we 're also able to put him through Article III courts to ensure that he 's held accountable for his crimes , '' Earnest added . `` This is somebody who 's going to be held accountable for his crimes and \u2026 that will be done in accordance with the laws and values of this country , and it will be done so in a pretty efficient way . ''\nStill , McConnell said that the administration 's justification `` makes little sense '' and the intelligence community `` deserve [ s ] the same access to intelligence and methods of defeating the enemy available to the team that found Bin Laden . ''\n`` At Guantanamo , [ Abu Ghaith ] could be held as a detainee and fulsomely and continuously interrogated without having to overcome the objections of his civilian lawyers , '' McConnell said .\nRep. Mike Rogers , R-Mich. , the chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , said civilian court `` is not the appropriate venue '' and the administration `` should treat enemy combatants like the enemy . ''\n`` Al Qaeda leaders captured on the battlefield should not be brought to the United States to stand trial , '' Rogers said . `` The president needs to send any captured al Qaeda members to Guantanamo . ''\nA spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner , who opposes closing Guantanamo and previously fought against efforts by the Obama administration to prosecute 9/11 suspects in New York City , said the speaker `` agrees '' with Rogers .\nNew York Republican Rep. Pete King , R-N.Y. , said he preferred that Abu Ghaith face trial in a military tribunal rather than civilian court , and he questioned what type of standard today 's hearing could set .\n`` While a federal court trial of Abu Ghaith in lower Manhattan would not present the same security issues as a trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , I strongly believe as a matter of policy that military tribunals are the proper venue for enemy combatants , '' said King , a member of the House committees on Intelligence and Homeland Security . `` If the Abu Ghaith trial does go forward in federal court , it must not be used as a precedent for future enemy combatants who should be tried at Guantanamo . ''\nBut not all members of Congress oppose the administration 's actions .\nNew York Democratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler , who represents the congressional district where Ground Zero is located in lower Manhattan , said he is `` pleased Sulaiman Abu Ghaith will have to face justice in New York .
