    "content": "Back in mid-June 2009 , two of Twitter \u2019 s highest ranking executives , co-founder Biz Stone and board member Jason Goldman , sat in a small , nondescript office at the company \u2019 s San Francisco headquarters and began drafting a blog post about a topic that they both realized was well beyond their comprehension : Iranian politics . By that point in its fledgling existence , Twitter was a three-year-old company experiencing the often peculiar exigencies of start-up life : the company , which had achieved widespread adulations at the 2007 SXSW conference as a \u201c status \u201d app that you might use to connect with friends at a rave or bar , had since grown into something else entirely , with a few expected pangs along the way . Twitter , which at the time was already on its third leader , had morphed into a company of some 60 employees , with tens of millions of users , including some of the most influential people on the planet . And while it had become a popular platform for entertainers and athletes ( and , as of a few months earlier , a certain orange-hued reality star ) , Twitter \u2019 s utility was now changing once again . As the protests mounted in Tehran to remove president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , many Iranians were using the social-media service to communicate with one another and foment their peaceful uprising in the name of # ChangeforIran . Whether it liked it or not , Twitter had become a political tool .\nStone and Goldman were fully aware of this development . As the now-familiar story goes , a person at the State Department known internally as an \u201c Iran watcher , \u201d had noticed that Twitter was planning to take the site offline for scheduled maintenance during one of the most pivotal protests in the country \u2019 s history . Hillary Clinton \u2019 s senior staffers had been given the go-ahead to ask Twitter to delay the maintenance until after the protest . After a slew of phone calls and e-mails , executives at the fast-growing start-up subsequently agreed , and on this June day , Stone and Goldman sat down to publish a post announcing that they would postpone the update for a day or two . As I reported in my book , Hatching Twitter , when the two men sat down to actually compose the blog post , they looked at each other , mystified by the responsibility and the challenge that had been laid upon them . \u201c We don \u2019 t know who the good guys are , or who the bad guys are , \u201d Stone said to Goldman .\nAlmost a decade later , Twitter is still struggling to understand who the good guys are , and who the bad guys are , and how to deal with them accordingly . And , now more than ever , Twitter often finds itself forced into a position as the ultimate arbiter between what is right and wrong in countless debates , skirmishes , and worse\u2014an uncomfortable role that was recently highlighted when Trump appeared to taunt Kim Jong Un on Twitter regarding the endowment of his nuclear button . Twitter \u2019 s centrality as the communications platform for these kinds of exchange is scary for obvious reasons , the most obvious of which is that Twitter , which disincentivizes nuance and patience and privacy , is where we increasingly talk about the most complex , intricate , and consequential topics . As the joke now goes , millions of people wake up each morning , log in to their Twitter accounts , and say to themselves , \u201c Who are we going to be mad at today ? \u201d The end result is that the platform is a place where fascists go head to head with snowflakes , neocons fight with conservatives , feminists argue with other feminists , bots attempt to out-bot other bots , climate-change deniers troll scientists , and the leader of the free world can play nuclear-football chicken .\nNo one is equipped to decide the fate of the free world in 280 characters or less , and Twitter \u2019 s founders almost certainly did not want to have the responsibility of brokering these conversations . But it \u2019 s hard to see how we can avoid catastrophe if the company doesn \u2019 t somehow find a way to manage the conversation . And that \u2019 s why many were frustrated , earlier this month , when C.E.O . Jack Dorsey put his foot down on the idea that Twitter would ever ban Trump , or any other world leader , from Twitter , no matter how many rules or regulations they broke . \u201c Blocking a world leader from Twitter or removing their controversial Tweets would hide important information people should be able to see and debate , \u201d the company explained in a blog post . \u201c It would also not silence that leader , but it would certainly hamper necessary discussion around their words and actions . \u201d\nTwitter is in an inarguably complicated spot , one that many of its earliest employees still can \u2019 t fathom it ended up in . On one hand , it \u2019 s a public company that has grown to 4,000 employees and $ 2.5 billion in revenue ; on the other , many of its employees are truly trying to make the world a better place , which , in their eyes , may require placing zero limits on free speech , as was the case during the Iranian protests of 2009 .
