    "content": "Questions swirled Wednesday over whether fugitive Edward Snowden , the admitted leaker of U.S. secrets , has a clear path to asylum in Ecuador .\nAs Russian officials reiterated that Mr. Snowden was in the transit zone of Moscow 's Sheremetyevo International Airport , his ability to leave appeared to hinge on two points\u2014whether there was a country that would allow him free transit on his way to Ecuador , which has said it would consider granting him asylum , and whether he had the temporary travel documents to get there .\nLate Wednesday , Univision Networks posted images of what it said was a `` safe pass '' for temporary travel that had been issued to Mr. Snowden\u2014a document he would need after U.S. officials said earlier this week they had canceled his passport . Word of such a pass echoed comments earlier this week by Julian Assange , the founder of antisecrecy group WikiLeaks , who said Ecuador had given Mr. Snowden a `` refugee document of passage . ''\nBut according to a senior official in Ecuador 's foreign ministry on Wednesday , Mr. Snowden had no such pass . `` He does not have any documents issued by the government of Ecuador , such as a passport or a refugee identification , '' said Galo Galarza , a senior ministry official . He did n't provide additional details .\nAlso Wednesday , Ecuador 's foreign ministry said the country would consider whether to grant asylum to Mr. Snowden if he presents himself at one of the country 's diplomatic missions .\n`` If he goes to an embassy , we will make a decision.\u2026But if he does n't , we can not speculate about it , '' Foreign Minister Ricardo Pati\u00f1o said on an official visit to Malaysia . Even then , Mr. Pati\u00f1o said , a decision could take a long time , as Ecuador is `` still studying '' the asylum request Mr. Snowden submitted . A message posted on Mr. Pati\u00f1o 's Twitter feed said the decision could be `` taken in one day , one week\u2026or two months . ''\nEcuador 's foreign minister , Ricardo Patino , arrives for a meeting in Malaysia on Wednesday . Reuters\nMr. Snowden arrived in Moscow from Hong Kong on Sunday , according to WikiLeaks , which has said it is funding and guiding the 30-year-old 's attempted escape . The U.S. , where authorities have filed espionage charges against Mr. Snowden , has demanded that international partners , including Russia , apprehend him . Russian President Vladimir Putin denied a U.S. request to expel Mr. Snowden , saying the U.S. fugitive is free to leave Sheremetyevo 's transit area and should get on his way .\nAn analysis of the commercial air routes available for a U.S. fugitive seeking to travel from Moscow showed that all necessary layover stops on the 7,000-mile route to Ecuador would be in countries that have extradition treaties with the U.S.\u2014including Cuba , which has been working recently to improve U.S. ties and has so far received two flights from Moscow since Sunday without Mr. Snowden aboard .\n`` I think the fact that for three days in a row , Snowden has n't gotten on the plane to Cuba begins to tell us something about how welcome he is in Havana , '' said Phil Peters , an analyst at the Cuba Research Center in Washington .\nIn Washington , Sen. Robert Menendez ( D. , N.J. ) , the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , said granting asylum to Mr. Snowden would imperil access to the U.S. market for Ecuadorean goods under a trade-preference regimen that must be renewed by Congress next month .\nSnowden on the Run U.S. authorities sought to catch Edward Snowden before he reached his next goal : political asylum in Ecuador .\n`` Our government will not reward countries for bad behavior , '' said Mr. Menendez in a news release . If Ecuador grants Mr. Snowden asylum , Mr. Menendez said he would lead the effort to cut Ecuador 's duty-free access to the U.S. market . `` I urge President [ Rafael ] Correa to do the right thing by the United States and Ecuador , and deny Snowden 's request for asylum . ''\nFour cities in the world could serve as a one-stop connection between Sheremetyevo airport and Quito , Ecuador , on a passenger flight , including Miami , Amsterdam and Madrid .\nThe fourth is Havana . That appears to make one of the five weekly flights on Russian airline OAO Aeroflot to Cuba Mr. Snowden 's best bet to reach Ecuador on a commercial flight .\nCuba has a bilateral extradition treaty with the U.S . The treaty has been little used in recent decades , though , and the country has a history of sheltering U.S. fugitives , most of them dating from the 1970s , including convicted murderers to hijackers . But Havana , which has just concluded talks in Washington about renewing direct postal links and is scheduled to start talks on immigration next month , would be loath to jeopardize a warming trend between the two countries , said Mr. Peters of the Cuba Research Center . In 2006 , in the State Department 's annual country report on terrorism , Havana said it would no longer provide safe haven to new fugitives , Mr. Peters noted .\n`` If that is the case , that 's what is applying to Snowden here , '' he said .\nRussia 's Mr. Putin has attempted to maintain some distance from Mr. Snowden , explaining that while the fugitive remains in the airport 's transit zone , he has n't crossed into Russian territory . But experts in international law say that while such zones are something of a no man 's land , they do n't operate outside a host country 's laws as would , for example , a diplomatic mission\u2014meaning that there would be little stopping Cuba from seizing a fugitive in its own transit zone .\n`` The misperception is that people in this zone are immune and that this is some kind of special international territory , which it is not .

Senegal does n't have an extradition treaty with the U.S . However , that scenario would require the cooperation of the German airline that operates the route , Deutsche Lufthansa AG . A Lufthansa spokesman said the airline never transports civilians on its cargo flights and would n't accommodate Mr. Snowden .\nOnly three or four private jets are capable of making a nonstop flight from Moscow to Quito .
