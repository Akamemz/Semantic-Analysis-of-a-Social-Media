The administration argued that the money that went to banks through the program would be better spent on direct federal loans to students or to Pell Grants, which provide students up to $5,600.\n\nA Democratic-led Congress approved the plan in March 2010 as part of the same budget bill that cemented Obama's signature health care legislation. It faced heavy opposition from Republicans, who criticized it as a \"government takeover\" of the student loan industry. But Rep. George Miller, the California Democrat who led the House committee that oversaw education, argued it ended a \"sweetheart deal\" for banks.\n\nDuring the debate, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the legislation would save the government up to $62 billion through 2020.\n\nMuch of that money has gone to the Pell Grant program, which has grown from about $19 billion in 2009 to a requested $36 billion for 2013. About 10 million students are expected to receive Pell Grants next year, up from about 6 million in the 2008-09 academic year, according to the Department of Education.\n\nHowever, observers of the higher education sector note that the grants aren't keeping up with inflated tuition.
