    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) With the first Democratic debate in the books , a new CNN/ORC poll finds most who watched think Hillary Clinton had the best performance of the night , but her strong showing has n't boosted her standing in the race for the party 's nomination .\nClinton stands at 45 % in the race for the Democratic nomination , with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders behind her at 29 % . Vice President Joe Biden , who is considering a run for presidency and did not participate in last week 's debate , follows at 18 % .\nBehind the top three , former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb had 1 % support , while former Rhode Island Gov . Lincoln Chafee , Harvard professor Larry Lessig and former Maryland Gov . Martin O'Malley all held less than 1 % support .\nCompared with pre-debate polling , Sanders ' support is up five points since mid-September , but no other candidate showed significant change .\nAs Biden mulls whether or not to get in the race , the poll suggests Democrats are becoming less enamored of a run from the vice president . In August , 53 % of registered Democrats said they wanted Biden to run , that 's down to 47 % in the new poll . Should Biden decide to sit out the race for the Democratic nomination , Clinton 's lead over Sanders climbs to 23 points : 56 % would back Clinton , 33 % Sanders .\nOverall , 31 % of registered Democrats say they watched all or most of the CNN/Facebook debate , held October 13 in Las Vegas . More than 6-in-10 Democrats who watched say Clinton did the best job , almost doubling the 35 % who thought Sanders had the best performance . On the other side of the coin , 43 % of those who watched said Chafee had the worst night , 31 % thought Webb did , 12 % O'Malley .\nAmong those Democrats who watched the debate , both Sanders and Biden are viewed more favorably than they are among Democratic voters generally : Sanders ' favorability number bumps from 62 % among all Democratic voters to 84 % among debate viewers , while Biden climbs from 76 % to 89 % favorable . Clinton 's numbers are about the same in both groups .\nDespite their positive feelings toward Biden , debate-watchers are more apt than others to say Biden should stay out of the contest ( 61 % think he should not run , compared with 43 % of those who did not watch ) and they are far more likely to be satisfied with the Democratic field generally ( 84 % compared with 64 % among those who did n't watch ) .\nAssessing the lesser-known candidates , debate-watchers are more positive than other Democrats toward O'Malley , ( 44 % favorable compared with 20 % among Democratic voters generally ) . But Webb and Chafee are both viewed more negatively among those who watched ( For Chafee , 32 % unfavorable among debate-watchers vs. 18 % among all Democratic voters ; Webb is at 37 % unfavorable among debate-watchers , 20 % among all Democratic voters ) .\nFollowing the debate , Clinton continues to dominate as the more trusted candidate across several top issues , with double-digit advantages over Sanders and Biden as the candidate who would best handle the economy , health care , foreign policy , race relations , climate change and gun policy . Clinton also now holds a small edge over Sanders as most trusted on income inequality ( 43 % Clinton , 38 % Sanders ) .\nDebate-watchers are more likely than others to say they trust Sanders on top issues , though even among this more-friendly audience , he continues to trail Clinton on most issues . Exceptions are income inequality ( 50 % of debate-watchers trust Sanders vs. 36 % for Clinton ) and climate change ( 40 % each say Clinton and Sanders would be best able to handle that ) .\nSanders gained no ground , however , on foreign policy . On that question , Clinton 's strength grows among those who watched : 77 % in that group say they trust her most to handle foreign policy , up from 66 % among Democratic voters overall .\nOn two issues where the debate highlighted differences among the candidates , fissures within the Democratic electorate on who would best handle them emerge .\nIncome inequality appears to be the most divisive issue , with women , older voters , those without college degrees , moderates and those with lower incomes more apt to trust Clinton on the issue , while those with college degrees , liberals , and urbanites are more likely to favor Sanders .\nAnd on gun policy , there 's a sharp gender divide . Women are far more likely to say they trust Clinton to handle it than men , 50 % to 37 % . Democratic gun owners are more evenly split on the question , with 35 % saying they trust Clinton most on gun policy , 27 % Sanders and 21 % Biden . Among those Democrats who do not own guns , it 's 48 % Clinton , 21 % Biden and 16 % Sanders .\nOverall , Democrats are n't much more satisfied with their field now than they were in July before any debates had happened . While the share `` very satisfied '' has risen from 26 % to 33 % , the share saying they are at least fairly satisfied has held steady at about 7-in-10 . Women do report feeling more satisfied with the field than men , but younger Democrats , a key group for Barack Obama 's general election victories , are far less satisfied with this field of candidates than older Democrats . Only about one-quarter of those under age 50 say they are very satisfied , compared with 40 % of those age 50 or older .\nWhen matched against the top candidates from the Republican field , Clinton , Sanders and Biden all top Donald Trump , who has been leading most polling on the Republican nomination contest since this summer . But Biden is the only one who holds a significant lead over Ben Carson , a more recent addition to the top of the Republican field . Trump trails Clinton by 5 , Sanders by 9 and Biden by 10 . But against Carson , both Clinton ( 47 % to Carson 's 48 % ) and Sanders ( 46 % to Carson 's 48 % ) run about evenly with the former neurosurgeon . Biden tops Carson by 8 points .\nThe CNN/ORC International Poll was conducted by telephone October 14-17 among a random national sample of 1,028 adult Americans . Results among the 425 registered voters who say they are Democrats or independents who lean toward the Democratic Party have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5 percentage points .",
