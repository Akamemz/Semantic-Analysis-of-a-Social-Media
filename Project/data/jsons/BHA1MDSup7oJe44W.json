Was the recent wave of kindness an aberration? Or is it the violence, especially police brutality against African Americans, that\u2019s the anomaly?\n\nNo. And absolutely not.\n\nThe acts of kindness witnessed before Floyd\u2019s death were genuine, frequently spontaneous and often viral. One morning in the midst of the Phase One lockdown, I woke up to find a calendar on my front stoop, left by Elaine O\u2019Neil, a neighbor whom I didn\u2019t know.\n\nLater O\u2019Neil explained, \u201cI wanted to do something to show our community that I was thinking about them, feeling the way they were feeling, trying to add something colorful and cheerful to a gloomy atmosphere of worry\u2026\u201d\n\nShe also wanted me to know that she\u2019s \u201cgotten many email thank you notes and written thank you notes regarding the calendars.

He said he's experienced \"an innate sense of joy\" from his teaching and that \"this joy can be a very powerful motivator. It can have a ripple or karmic effect on our lives.\"\n\nKindness also is rooted in our past. Especially at times of crisis or disaster \u2014 think 9/11 or Hurricane Katrina \u2014 \u201cthe soul of the country manifests itself in an inclination to open our arms rather than to clench our fists; to look out rather than to turn inward; to accept rather than to reject,\u201d wrote historian Jon Meacham.\n\nKindness begets kindness.\n\nViolent acts also haunt us\n\nTragically, though, violence also has a ripple effect: George Floyd\u2019s death at the knee of a white police officer came in a long line of African Americans' deaths: Tamir Rice, the 12-year-old African American boy carrying a toy gun who was killed in Cleveland by a 26-year-old white police officer; Sandra Bland, the 28-year-old African American woman found hanged in a Texas jail cell three days after being arrested during a traffic stop; Eric Garner, who died after a white police officer in Staten Island, N.Y., put him in a chokehold while arresting him; Travon Martin, the 17-year-old African American teenager shot dead by a neighborhood watch coordinator in Sanford, Fla.; Breonna Taylor, the black woman fatally shot by police in her own kitchen in Louisville, Ky.; and Ahmaud Arbery, the unarmed black man who was fatally shot while jogging in Atlanta.\n\nThese are only recent deaths in a long thread of violence against Blacks, an indelible stain on the American experiment that reaches back 400 years, to 1619, when 20 enslaved Africans first arrived in the colonies.\n\nKindness and violence, they are the twisted DNA of this nation.\n\nIt can be difficult to see hope against the dark. In the past three weeks, violence has dominated headlines and newscasts, most notably the egregious actions of law enforcement and the Trump administration. The righteous anger of those protesting brutality has been met with more violence: rubber bullets, tear gas and excessive force.\n\nNeighbors step out to help\n\nBut even in the current struggle to ensure that black lives matter, myriad acts of kindness are taking place. In Nashville, stylist Shawn Marqus Dromgoole expressed his fear of leaving his house on Instagram. \"I was afraid to walk by myself in my childhood neighborhood, because I was afraid I wouldn't live to see another day,\" he captioned his photos. \"When I shared this fear with my neighbors they said we will walk with you. This is only the beginning.\"\n\nIn Columbus, Ohio, The Dispatch reported, \u201cStrangers walked Downtown streets with trash bags and buckets, cleaning up their city. Some of them had been at the protests the night before. Others saw the protests on TV and knew they could help restore peace, one strewn plastic water bottle at a time.\u201d\n\nKindness is not an antiquated concept \u2014 it\u2019s alive and well, here and now.
