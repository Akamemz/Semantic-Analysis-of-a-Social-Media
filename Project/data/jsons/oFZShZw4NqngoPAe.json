The insiders participated in the survey immediately following the debate in Des Moines , an event more notable for the absence of Iowa and national poll-leader Donald Trump than anything else .\nMore than 4 in 10 GOP insiders \u2014 given the choice of the seven GOP candidates on the stage , plus Trump \u2014 rated Cruz as the loser of Thursday night \u2019 s debate , citing his defensive posture on his past immigration stances and opposition to ethanol subsidies .\n\u201c He seemed plastic and insincere , \u201d said one Iowa Republican , who , like all respondents , completed the post-debate survey anonymously . \u201c The crowd clearly liked Gov . [ Terry ] Branstad a lot more than they like Ted Cruz . \u201d\n\u201c His entanglement with the moderators was one of the worst moments for a candidate in any of the debates , \u201d added a New Hampshire Republican , alluding to the Texas senator \u2019 s sparring with Fox News Channel \u2019 s Chris Wallace . \u201c His opposition to ethanol was also highlighted on the eve of the Iowa caucuses . \u201d\n\u201c He did not explain his switch on immigration policy very well , \u201d another New Hampshire Republican said , citing Cruz \u2019 s attempts to address questions about his legislative maneuvering in the Senate during the 2013 immigration debate .\nAs for the winner of Thursday night \u2019 s debate , Marco Rubio ( 36 percent ) and former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush ( 29 percent ) were the top two finishers , according to the insiders .\nOne Iowa Republican called Rubio the \u201c strongest and most articulate \u201d candidate participating in the debate .
