To date , he has trailed Obama by single digits for months in most national polls while the president recently has watched his lead grow in key swing states .\nThe debate stage , for Romney , represents an opportunity to win over the wishy-washy .

In the run-up to Wednesday , each campaign is now engaged in a delicate political dance , trying to manage expectations and shoot down potential talking points while generally psyching out the other side .\nDueling campaign memos released Thursday and Friday contained practically the same message : The other guy is a skilled debater , the other guy has the advantage , but our guy has the truth on his side and debates are n't the only factor .\n`` Just as he was in the primaries , we expect Mitt Romney to be a prepared , disciplined and aggressive debater , '' Obama adviser David Axelrod wrote in a memo Friday , adding that debates `` generally favor challengers . ''\nAxelrod went on to list several other advantages Romney supposedly has -- the Republican nominee got plenty of debate practice during the primaries , and he 's `` unencumbered '' by the responsibility of being president .\n`` Maybe this is why the Romney campaign has so confidently predicted for months that he will turn in a campaign-changing performance such as Ronald Reagan 's in 1980 , '' Axelrod wrote .\nHe was referring to Reagan 's late surge past then-President Jimmy Carter in the polls following a strong debate performance .\nAxelrod 's counterpart on the Romney campaign , adviser Beth Myers , made a similar case .\n`` While Governor Romney has the issues and the facts on his side , President Obama enters these contests with a significant advantage on a number of fronts , '' she wrote in a strategy memo . `` Voters already believe -- by a 25-point margin -- that President Obama is likely to do a better job in these debates .
