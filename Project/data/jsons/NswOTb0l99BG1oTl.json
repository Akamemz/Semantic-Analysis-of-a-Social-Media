''\nIt is the centuries-honored tradition of conquest and control : What you take is what you have .\nIn Mosul , ISIS looted the central bank and other smaller provincial banks , resulting in a financial windfall of tens and possibly hundreds of millions of dollars .\nISIS formed in the void created by the pullout of U.S. troops and the retreating Iraqi army , says Mouaz Moustafa , the executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force in Washington . In the lawlessness that followed , he says , ISIS took over , robbed banks , began taxing and extorting the population , and now funds its war and expansion across Iraq and Syria almost independently .\nMoustafa lobbies U.S. lawmakers for more support of moderate Syrian rebels who are now fighting both ISIS and the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad . He recently helped bring together several Congressional delegations to meet with moderate rebel groups on the border as part of that effort .\nCoalition airstrikes , he says , are n't enough to destroy the kind of self-financing mob that ISIS has become . Instead , you need to take back the territory and restore civil order .\n`` They 're taxing the people ; that 's a huge revenue , '' he says of ISIS . `` But not only that . They also control sort of the breadbasket of Syria , in terms of Raqqa ( their defacto capital ) . They 've got the cotton and the wheat and all these other things .
