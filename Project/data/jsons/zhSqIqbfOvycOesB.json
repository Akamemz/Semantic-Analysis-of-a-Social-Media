The proposal includes more funding to help insurance plans cover the sickest patients , along with possibly changing the timing of the open enrollment season in hopes of attracting more Americans to sign up for insurance .\nThese Democrats are agitating for a new strategy , one where they speak openly about the health law \u2019 s weak spots \u2014 particularly the individual market \u2014 and how to shore them up . The party has so far been reticent to highlight Obamacare \u2019 s problems at a moment when Democrats are fighting against Republican efforts to repeal parts of the law .\n\u201c We need an alternative to the \u2018 just say no \u2019 policy that has pervaded Democrats up until now , \u201d says Rep. Kurt Schrader ( D-OR ) , who is involved with the new proposal . \u201c Let \u2019 s have that conversation . Let \u2019 s fix the damn thing and get real . \u201d\nThe plan notably does not come from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi \u2019 s office , which has not put forward any similar proposal . An aide said Pelosi was aware of this effort and supportive of the discussion , although did not comment on the specific policies .\nStill , it represents a shift from congressional Democrats \u2019 Obamacare strategy thus far , which has largely focused on defending the law \u2014 alongside a mounting push for a single-payer-style health plan to replace it eventually .\n\u201c Some Democrats are fearful to talk about what is wrong with [ Obamacare ] for fear we \u2019 ll be seen as abandoning it , \u201d says Rep. Peter Welch ( D-VT ) , a relatively progressive Democrat who supports Medicare-for-all . But he says now is a moment to talk about fixing Obamacare , and not single-payer . \u201c There is the practical reality that we \u2019 ve got a Republican president and a Republican Congress , \u201d he says . \u201c That \u2019 s not the opportune moment for Medicare-for-all . We \u2019 ve got to defend what we have . \u201d\nThis plan focuses on the Affordable Care Act \u2019 s individual market , which is struggling to attract health plans to sell coverage in 2018 . There are 38 counties that currently have zero options for next year .\nSome of the representatives involved in this effort have districts with significant rural areas , which have particularly struggled to attract multiple insurers .\nThe marketplaces have never had the robust competition that the health law \u2019 s drafters expected . Many plans lost money during their first years and quit . The Trump administration \u2019 s uncertain management of the marketplaces and threats of repeal have exacerbated the challenge .\nThis new plan proposes stabilizing the individual market with the following policies :\nCreating a permanent fund to offset the costs of especially expensive patients . This reinsurance program would funnel extra money to the health insurers who get stuck with high-cost patients . The Affordable Care Act included a program like this , but it was temporary and set to phase out in 2018 .\nThis program would be expected to reduce premiums , as insurance plans would know they \u2019 d get federal help for their highest bills . The Democrats \u2019 proposal would make this a permanent program with $ 15 billion in annual funding . The idea has found at least some favor with Republicans : This week , the Trump administration gave Alaska the funding it would need to create a state-level version of the program .\nMaking permanent the health law \u2019 s cost-sharing reduction subsidies . The Affordable Care Act included subsidies to reduce low-income patients \u2019 copayments and deductibles . The program is currently facing a federal court challenge , where House Republicans have argued the law didn \u2019 t appropriate its funding . The White House has floated the idea of halting the subsidies abruptly . This proposal would make them permanent and no longer subject to uncertainty .\nEnforcing the individual mandate and advertising open enrollment . This isn \u2019 t as much of a fix to the Affordable Care Act as it is a directive to the Trump administration to continue enforcing the health law \u2019 s requirement that all Americans purchase health coverage \u2014 and let people know when to sign up . Fears were stoked this winter when the administration came into power and quickly canceled outreach advertising contracts the Obama administration had purchased .\nOne other way the Democrats could strengthen the law would be to make the individual mandate penalty more severe , charging people a higher price to remain uninsured . But the group didn \u2019 t go that way , knowing such a proposal would be unpopular \u2014 and toxic to Republicans with whom they hope to discuss their ideas . \u201c The mandate may be too hard for the Republicans to swallow , \u201d says Rep. Ami Bera ( D-CA ) .\nPossibly changing the open enrollment period to align with tax season . This is an idea that hasn \u2019 t gotten mentioned as much : Move the open enrollment season to the spring , to coincide with when Americans are getting their tax returns and may have some extra cash to spend on health insurance . The Trump administration currently plans to end open enrollment on December 15 , which some consumer advocates worry will lead those who are cash-strapped from Christmas spending to skip coverage .\nA Medicare buy-in for older Americans . This idea was tossed around during the health care law \u2019 s drafting , and it would allow the elderly \u2014 who face some of the highest premiums in the individual market \u2014 to enroll in Medicare instead . The proposal does not specify at what age the buy-in would begin .\nSome of these ideas , like the reinsurance fund and the permanent cost-sharing reduction subsidies , are broadly quite similar to reforms recently proposed by the liberal Center for American Progress think tank .\nThe group of 10 Democrats will roll out their proposal Wednesday morning and then begin outreach on both sides of the aisle , hoping to gin up some momentum for turning the three-page white paper into actual legislation .\nSchrader was uncertain about whether Pelosi would endorse the bill and made the case that it might depend on rank-and-file members demanding that this Obamacare fix plan be taken seriously .\n\u201c Hopefully a number of members will petition Pelosi and will petition [ House Speaker Paul ] Ryan about this , \u201d he says . \u201c We \u2019 ve got a reasonable solution . I think our leadership is coming around . We \u2019 ve worked with them on the timing of this . \u201d\nBut getting either party on board may be a tough sell . This proposal comes mostly from more centrist Democratic legislators . The more progressive wing of the party has looked at single-payer health care as the next policy objective rather than small tweaks to existing law .\nAnd Republicans have so far been hesitant to do anything to help Democrats run the Affordable Care Act .
