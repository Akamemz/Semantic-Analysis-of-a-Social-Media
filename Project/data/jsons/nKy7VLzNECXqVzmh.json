As Trump has failed to make strides to remedy the problem, Democrats are becoming more vocal.\n\nSome Democrats have been making big promises on healthcare, vowing to sweeping overhauls and complete government takeovers.\n\nBut even candidates like U.S. Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who would abolish private health insurance, are wading into the debate about lowering costs for consumers buying drugs in the current market.\n\nTrump talked regularly about drug prices during his 2016 campaign, but has failed so far to deliver the changes he promised.\n\nOn Thursday his administration scrapped one of its most ambitious proposals for lowering prescription medicine prices, backing down from a policy aimed at health insurers and raising the possibility of new measures focused on drugmakers.\n\nThe abandoned proposal would have required health insurers to pass billions of dollars in rebates from drugmakers to Medicare patients.\n\nDrug prices directly affect consumers, making it a more pressing concern for voters than debates over the structure of the healthcare system, said Robert Blendon, a political scientist at Harvard University who researches public opinion on healthcare.\n\nBlendon said Trump, having failed to broker any deals in Congress, made his drug price plan too complicated, and voters are unlikely to see him as having made any strides.
