In Minnesota we lived through this in 1998 , when Jesse Ventura was elected , '' explained Ken Martin , the chairman of Minnesota 's Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party and a Clinton fundraiser . `` The concern for me at the DFL is that there 's a complacency among some party leaders who do n't believe that he 's electable . The more that people believe that , the more dangerous it gets .
