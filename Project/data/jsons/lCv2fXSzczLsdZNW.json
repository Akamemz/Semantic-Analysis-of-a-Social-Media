    "content_original": "What gyms are doing to reduce the risk\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revised its website to emphasize that touching contaminated surfaces does not appear to be a main way the virus spreads. Even so, gyms are taking precautions, from purchasing electrostatic sprayers to ensure every millimeter of surface area is disinfected to getting rid of porous equipment such as foam rollers.\n\nSome of the key changes gyms across the country are making to minimize risk include:\n\n1. New check-in procedures\n\nNearly all gyms have implemented a touch-free check-in process and some are enforcing temperature scans. Cooper Fitness Centers has one of the most thorough check-in protocols. Before being allowed to enter the club, members must now answer questions including: \u201cAre you experiencing any flulike symptoms? Is anyone in your household currently under COVID-19 quarantine?\u201d They then have their temperature taken and are given a wristband to signal to staffers they passed the health screening.\n\n2. Masks and gloves for staff\n\nMedical experts believe the virus spreads mainly from person to person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. Nearly all gyms are mandating that staff wear face masks and gloves. Instead of masks, spin instructors are wearing clear face shields that better accommodate microphones while still providing a barrier of protection. Members are not required to wear masks, though Zwiefel estimates 1 in 10 returning Life Time members do.\n\nDavid Flench, director of Hancock Wellness Center, a medically integrated fitness center in Greenfield, Ind., says their gym has decided not to require anyone doing vigorous exercise to wear a mask, based on the opinion of Hancock Health's medical director. People doing low-impact exercise are encouraged to wear one.\n\n3. Physical distancing\n\nGyms are strictly implementing the CDC's suggested 6 feet of social distancing by spacing out everything from cardio equipment to lockers and encouraging members to share a thumbs up instead of a high five. Crunch Fitness staff held trial runs of socially distanced group fitness classes to ensure that floor graphics kept people 6 to 8 feet apart.\n\nGyms have shut down contact sports like basketball and those that have opened pools are limiting usage to single-lane swimming.

Smaller class sizes and no shared equipment\n\nA number of gyms have decided to continue solely with virtual group fitness classes in phase one of reopening.
