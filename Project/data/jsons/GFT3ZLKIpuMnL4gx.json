Flynn is a retired Army lieutenant general who served as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency until August 2014 .\nAmerican officials said this week they plan to train up to 25,000 Iraqi troops in a major mission to retake Mosul , Iraq \u2019 s second-largest city , from Islamic State militants sometime this spring .\nThe mission is welcome , but frankly it is unlikely to succeed unless there is , at the same time , a deeper understanding on the part of our government of the real threat that the Islamic State and its adherents pose to us as a nation\u2014and what our role in this broader fight must be . Unless the United States takes dramatically more action than we have done so far in Iraq , the fractious , largely Shiite-composed units that make up the Iraqi army are not likely to be able , by themselves , to overwhelm a Sunni stronghold like Mosul , even though they outnumber the enemy by ten to one . The United States must be prepared to provide far more combat capabilities and enablers such as command and control , intelligence , logistics , and fire support , to name just a few things .\nYet to defeat an enemy , you first must admit they exist , and this we have not done . I believe there continues to be confusion at the highest level of our government about what it is we \u2019 re facing , and the American public want clarity as well as moral and intellectual courage , which they are not now getting .\nThere are some who argue that violent Islamists are not an existential threat and therefore can simply be managed as criminals , or as a local issue in Iraq and Syria . I respectfully and strongly disagree .\nWe , as a nation , must accept and face the reality that we and other contributing nations of the world are at war , and not just in Iraq .
