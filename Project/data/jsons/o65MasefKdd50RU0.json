    "content": "As he prepares to deliver his budget on Monday , President Barack Obama is lurching to the left .\nThe president has already proposed \u2014 and had to drop \u2014 a plan to tax college savings accounts . He \u2019 s writing for The Huffington Post . He declared war on \u201c mindless austerity \u201d while pledging fresh tax hikes on banks and the rich to pay for free community college and other goodies . Remember those budget caps put in place in 2011 ? Obama wants to blast right through them .\nIt \u2019 s a progressive \u2019 s dream version of Obama , untethered from earlier centrist leanings and flirtations with \u201c grand bargains \u201d with Republicans on entitlement reform . But the approach also carries significant risks , analysts and some Democrats say .\nObama could wind up alienating moderate swing voters who still tend to worry about debt and deficits , generally oppose higher taxes and fear the economy the president is now celebrating is not really all that great . And the president could wind up bequeathing to nominee-in-waiting Hillary Clinton a Democratic Party that is oriented well to the left of her traditional comfort zone , making an eventual general election campaign more challenging .\n\u201c There are some real risks here , though we won \u2019 t be able to assess whether they have really gone too far left until we see the full budget , \u201d said Matt Bennett , co-founder of the centrist Democratic group Third Way . \u201c We are big believers in dealing with the long-term mandatory spending crisis and driving economic growth for the middle class , and we hope to see some of that when the whole budget comes out . \u201d\nObama initially wanted to include a provision in his budget taxing 529 college savings plans , arguing they tend to benefit wealthier families . But many of those families reside well below the level Obama himself previously defined as \u201c middle class , \u201d having combined household incomes of below $ 250,000 .\nAfter a backlash from both Republicans and Democrats \u2014 including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi \u2014 the White House backed off the plan and said it would not be in the budget . Asked why they dropped it , White House spokesman Eric Shultz called the issue a \u201c distraction \u201d that was taking attention away from other elements of the president \u2019 s education agenda .\nBut its initial inclusion suggested that Obama had recalibrated his view of what constitutes \u201c middle class \u201d in America . In his 2008 campaign , Obama repeatedly vowed that no family making under $ 250,000 per year would face \u201c any form of tax increase . \u201d\nObama has also clearly signaled that his days of negotiating big budget cuts with Republicans are over .\n\u201c America \u2019 s resurgence is real , \u201d Obama wrote on the progressive Huffington Post website on Thursday . \u201c With a growing economy , shrinking deficits , bustling industry , and booming energy production , we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth , \u201d the president wrote , arguing for an end to sequestration spending cuts . He vowed to \u201c eliminate the trust fund loophole that allows the wealthiest Americans to avoid paying taxes on their unearned income , and use the savings to cut taxes for middle class families . \u201d\nHowever , an analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that the president \u2019 s proposals to enact a new tax on large banks while increasing the capital gains levy would actually increase taxes on those in the middle section of earners , while giving the biggest tax cut to those with incomes $ 25,000 and below .\nIn addition , the president told House Democrats at their party retreat in Philadelphia on Thursday that he would propose increasing spending by $ 74 billion above previously agreed-to \u201c sequestration \u201d spending caps for the upcoming fiscal year .\nBoth parties and many fiscal policy experts loathe the sequester caps as arbitrary and damaging . But analysts say Obama risks tacking too hard left on the overall issue of spending and long-term debt . Data from the Pew Research center show that 55 percent of Democrats still view deficit reduction as a \u201c top priority . \u201d\nAnd while the short-term deficit numbers Obama regularly cites as a major achievement are real , the longer-term picture is much darker . The Congressional Budget Office on Monday reported that even with current spending restraint and a rosy outlook for economic growth , deficits between 2016 and 2025 would reach $ 7.6 trillion . And even now , the $ 13 trillion in federal debt expected by the end of the current fiscal year would amount to 74 percent of gross domestic product , twice what it was in 2007 and the highest level since 1950 .\nProgressives tend to dismiss these long-term budget projections as just wild guesses that will come down if health care costs keep declining . And they love the president \u2019 s new approach .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s great , \u201d said Mike Konczal of the progressive Roosevelt Institute . \u201c It doesn \u2019 t feel like this budget is trying to set up negotiations with Republicans like he \u2019 s done in the past , and it takes the focus off the deficit as the biggest problem . \u201d\nPolling data suggest the general public takes the longer-term deficit picture much more seriously , potentially leaving Obama out of step with average Americans . \u201c The concern about the deficit has subsided at the moment but it has not gone away , \u201d said Bill Galston , a scholar at the Brookings Institution who worked in the White House under President Bill Clinton . \u201c You have a bit of running room if you are president right now , but it \u2019 s not an infinite amount of running room . You certainly can not let it rip on the spending front without incurring some serious risks . \u201d\nThe budget itself is mostly a political document . Republicans are expected to dismiss it as dead on arrival on Monday , and it is not likely to serve as the basis for any negotiations on fiscal policy later this year .\nBut it will serve as an important marker of where the party is as the 2016 presidential campaign approaches and Hillary Clinton launches her expected bid to succeed Obama . And some in the Democratic Party worry that when Clinton does finally announce her campaign \u2014 which sources told \u2588\u2588\u2588 may not come until July \u2014 she may take over as the head of a party celebrated by the activist left but without a clear purchase on the moderate voters who will help decide the outcome of the election in Florida , Ohio and other key swing states .\nClinton has already proved herself very unsteady when wielding a populist message that targets the rich . She stumbled on the campaign trail in 2014 , saying it was not corporations that create jobs . And she has earned a good bit of her sizable personal wealth in fees generated by speaking to the same Wall Street executives that Obama is targeting in his budget .\nThe direction Obama is steering the party lines up much more closely with the politics of Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts , who recently succeeded in killing Obama \u2019 s nomination of a Wall Street banker for a top administration post and who has emerged as a major power broker in the increasingly liberal congressional wing of the party .\nAll this has Republicans salivating at the thought of Hillary Clinton inheriting a much more liberal version of the Democratic Party , possibly against a moderate Republican such as former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush running on a platform of speeding up economic growth . \u201c Obama \u2019 s budget and his second-term lurch to the left presents not just headaches for his own lame duck agenda but also for Hillary \u2019 s 2016 prospects , \u201d said Kirsten Kukowski , national spokesperson for the Republican National Committee . \u201c No wonder the message ahead of the Democrat retreat is that their party doesn \u2019 t have a message . \u201d\nKukowski was referring to a survey of Democratic House members conducted ahead of the party \u2019 s retreat in Philadelphia suggesting the party lacked a coherent economic message in the 2014 midterms . The question now is whether the message Obama is crafting resonates with or alienates the middle-class voters Democrats are now so focused on .\nThere is also the question of whether Obama is declaring victory on the economy before it has really gained much traction . Obama declared in his State of the Union that the \u201c shadow of crisis \u201d had passed and the state of the union was strong . And remarks around his budget suggest the president believes that the resurgent economy and shrinking deficit allow him to ramp up spending on liberal priorities while increasing taxes on banks and investment capital .\nBut not all of the economic data are strong . Pending home sales dropped nearly 4 percent in December , the biggest drop in over a year , further evidence that a slow housing sector continues to drag on the economy . And the jobless rate is down so low in part because the labor force participation rate , at 62.7 percent , is the lowest it has been since the late 1970s . And wages for middle-income Americans have declined under Obama when adjusted for inflation .\nThe president is now attempting to address these problems with a mix of higher taxes on the rich and banks and increased government spending , an approach not guaranteed to be a huge hit , politically .\nBut even if that message fails to resonate beyond the progressive base , some senior Democrats say Clinton might be able to set herself up in part as an alternative to the Obama approach , embracing the positives of his economic record while pivoting away from some of his policy proposals . This is part of the reason Clinton is inclined to delay her announcement as long as possible , some Democrats suggest . So if Obama \u2019 s new tack to the left does fall flat , Clinton can shift the party right back to the middle .\n\u201c She will obviously have to take into account the predicates that the president lays down , \u201d said Galston . \u201c But she won \u2019 t feel that it \u2019 s politically necessary to take them on board as her own program . She has pretty memorably butted heads with Obama before . And it certainly would not be unprecedented for a president , even a Clinton , to take office while not being in perfect lock step with the rest of the Democratic Party . \u201d",
