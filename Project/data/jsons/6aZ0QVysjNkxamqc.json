Tom Cole of Oklahoma , a member of the leadership team that helps round up House votes , told fellow GOP lawmakers that he thought they should , as a matter of political strategy , extend just the tax-rate cuts for those making $ 250,000 or less before the end of the year -- a position being pushed by President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats .\nCole first floated the idea at a closed-door meeting of the Republican whip team on Tuesday and his comments were first reported by Politico .\nCole told reporters after another meeting on Wednesday with House Republicans that he believed giving certainty to the majority of American taxpayers now was important .
