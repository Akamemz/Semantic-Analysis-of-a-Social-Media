Maria Butina pleaded guilty ... but the finish line looks no closer\n\nThe shifting sands\n\nPolitical and legal danger for President Trump may be sharpening by the day, but the case that his campaign might have conspired with the Russian attack on the 2016 election is still unproven despite two years of investigations, court filings and even numerous convictions and guilty pleas.\n\nTrump has been implicated in ordering a scheme to silence two women ahead of Election Day in 2016 about the alleged sexual relationships they had with him years before.\n\nThat is a serious matter, or it might have been in other times, but this scheme is decidedly not a global conspiracy with a foreign power to steal the election.\n\nMore broadly, the president and his supporters say, the payments to the women in 2016 are penny ante stuff: Breaking campaign finance law, if that did take place, isn't like committing murder, said one lawyer for the president.\n\nThe \"biased\" Justice Department is just grasping at straws to use something against Trump because it hasn't been able to locate a \"smocking gun,\" as Trump wrote this week, that would tie his campaign in with Russia's active measures in 2016.\n\nThere's an important kernel of truth in that argument \u2014 not only is there no smoking gun, but the Russia case also appears to have been weakening, not strengthening, while America's eyes have been on the payments.\n\nThe charges they didn't make\n\nItem: Cohen ostensibly played a key role in the version of events told by the infamous, partly unverified Russia dossier. He denied that strongly to Congress. He also has admitted lying to Congress and submitted an important new version of other events.\n\nBut that new story didn't include a trip to Prague, as described in the dossier.
