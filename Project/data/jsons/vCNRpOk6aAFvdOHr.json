On April 21 , Reuters reported that more than 234 young girls had been kidnapped from Chibok school in Nigeria by an extremist group known as Boko Haram .

But this week its stunning abduction appeared too much even for fellow militants normally eager to condone terrorist acts against the West and its allies . [ ... ] Boko Haram is in many ways an awkward ally for any of them . Its violence is broader and more casual than Al Qaeda or other jihadist groups . Indeed , its reputation for the mass murder of innocent civilians is strikingly inconsistent with a current push by Al Qaeda 's leaders to avoid such deaths for fear of alienating potential supporters . That was the subject of the dispute that led to Al Qaeda 's recent break with its former affiliate , the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria . What 's more , Boko Haram 's recruits and targets have always been purely local , not international . And the group is centered on a messianic leader who claims to speak with God and demands that its adherents surrender all their possessions to the group , resembling a cult , like Uganda 's Lord 's Resistance Army , more than it does an orthodox Islamist movement .

Asst . Secretary of State for African Affairs Johnnie Carson defended the decision not to label Boko Haram a foreign terrorist group , arguing that the designation \u201c would in fact raise its profile , give it greater publicity , give it greater credibility , help in its recruitment , and also probably drive more assistance in its direction \u201d :\nIn 2012 , more than 20 prominent U.S. academics in African studies wrote to Clinton , urging her to not to label Boko Haram as a foreign terrorist organization . \u201c An FTO designation would internationalize Boko Haram 's standing and enhance its status among radical organizations elsewhere , \u201d the scholars said . \u201c There was a concern that putting Boko Haram on the foreign terrorist list would in fact raise its profile , give it greater publicity , give it greater credibility , help in its recruitment , and also probably drive more assistance in its direction , \u201d he said . The U.S. has plenty of ways to assist the Nigerian government with counterterrorism even without designating Boko Haram , Carson said .

[ The Daily Beast , 5/7/14 ]\nCSIS : Designating FTO Status Is Not Always An Appropriate Tool To Combat Terrorism . The Center for Strategic And International Studies ( CSIS ) pointed out that FTO designation is not always an appropriate tool to \u201c mitigate a given threat. \u201d In an October , 2012 study of the FTO status ' effect on Pakistani-based Haqqani network , CSIS argued that FTO status actually hampered the United States ' ability combat the designated group :\nFTO designation is deliberately left to the discretion of the secretary of state and reflects his or her judgment about the most appropriate way to mitigate a given threat . As a report by the Congressional Research Service explains , \u201c There may be competing priorities in dealing with a group , such as a desire to engage a group in negotiations or to use the FTO naming as leverage for another foreign policy aim. \u201d The Taliban 's continuing absence from the FTO list , despite also meeting the criteria , is one reflection of these competing priorities . The key question then is whether designation is the appropriate tool to apply given the priorities in this case . The case for designation relies largely on its expected financial effects on the Haqqanis ; on the diplomatic pressure the designation might exert on Pakistan to oppose the network more vigorously ; and finally on the perceived need for the United States to use \u201c all available tools \u201d to curtail the group 's activities . In reality , however , designation restricts the tools available , and its financial , diplomatic , and military effects on the ground will be at best unhelpful and at worst counterproductive .
