This starts becoming the definition of terrorism when people develop anxiety about what should be free-flowing public places.\n\nFRANK FIGLIUZZI:\n\nExactly right. The definition of terrorism is conduct designed to co-intimidate the civilian population, and if we don\u2019t take action quickly, then that will continue to play out. I have a piece out just tonight in the New York Times on what, sadly, I think is going to happen next if we don\u2019t disrupt the chain of radicalization.\n\nWhat were the warning signs for me, Brian, ironically, they weren\u2019t from my experience in domestic terrorism, but rather they were from my experience in international terrorism and radicalization to Islamic jihad. You see the same things happening now in white hate groups and white supremacy groups where not only is the Internet facilitating the speed of radicalization but our leader, our chief executive is seen as almost a mentor and a radicalizer and unfortunately, today, we did not hear what we needed to hear from that person that these extremists and unstable people look to.\n\nHe spoke in the passive voice, in the collective voice. We didn\u2019t hear first-person from him. We didn\u2019t hear \u201cI condemn\u201d white hate ideology. We heard \u201cthe nation\u201d must condemn it. Well, the nation does condemn it, but we didn`t hear what we needed to hear, so what happens is the extremists interpreted what the president read off a script today as something he needed to say, something he didn\u2019t really want to say. So, the president is either getting really good advice and rejecting it or is getting really bad advice. And I\u2019ll give you an example of that. We have to understand the adversary and the threat we\u2019re dealing with. And if we don\u2019t understand how they think, we\u2019ll never understand how to encounter them. So it\u2019s little things and language and messaging that matters. The president said that we will fly our flags at half-mast until August 8th. That`s 8/8. Now, I\u2019m not going to imply that he did this deliberately but I am using it as an example of the ignorance of the adversary that`s being demonstrated by the White House.\n\nThe numbers 88 are very significant in neo-Nazi and white supremacist movement. Why? Because the letter H is the eighth letter of the alphabet and to them, the numbers 88 together stand for \u201cHeil Hitler.\u201d So we\u2019re going to be raising the flag back up at dusk on 8/8. No one is thinking about this. No one is giving him advice or he\u2019s rejecting the advice. So, understand your adversary to counter the adversary.",
