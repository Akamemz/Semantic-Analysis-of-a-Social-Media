The move would hand the party a major accomplishment to tout heading into the 2018 midterm elections .\nBoth the House and Senate took steps this week toward that goal . The House cleared its 2018 fiscal year budget , with 18 Republicans joining Democrats in voting against it . Meanwhile , the Senate Budget Committee advanced its own measure along party lines .\nThe fiscal blueprint will unlock a procedure allowing Republicans to bypass a filibuster and pass tax legislation through the Senate with 51 votes .\nBut key lawmakers are warning that while the budget is a necessary first step , they still have a long way to go before getting a bill to President Trump \u2019 s desk .\nSen.
