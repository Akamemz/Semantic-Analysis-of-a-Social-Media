    "content": "In Florida , Democrat Andrew Gillum preached it to supporters up and down the state . Throughout the week , Stacey Abrams , his counterpart in Georgia , pushed new ads with the same demand .\nBoth Gillum and Abrams lost their respective races for governor . But their message , as the recounts and lawsuits wind down , is expected to endure and , with a Democratic House majority headed to Washington , escalate ahead of the coming presidential cycle .\nEmboldened by their midterm successes and enraged by the handling of elections in Florida and Georgia , Democrats are now girding for what many on the left view as an existential fight over voting rights across the country . The court decisions handed down over the past few days , as Florida Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson fought to expand the scope of the recount and Abrams sued to bring more ballots into the mix , are likely to shape future Democratic campaigns in Republican-held states with restrictive voting laws .\nThe returns to date have offered the party new reason for hope -- and cause for continued concern . Faced with a rapid-fire succession of legal challenges , judges have refused to strike down or roll back laws Democrats argue were designed to disenfranchise minorities and the poor . But the courts have also been willing to offer relief to narrowly affected voter groups , like the thousands snagged by Florida 's `` signature match '' law , who were allowed an extra few days to clear their ballots .\nLet America Vote , the nonprofit started by former Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander , has been frustrated by the outcomes , but pleased to see the sun shining on the process .\n`` What this has really highlighted is that there are probably a bunch of people in Florida who have been disenfranchised in past elections and did n't even know it , '' Abe Rakov , Let America Vote 's chairman , told CNN . `` But now that this election is so close , and people are making sure that every eligible vote is being counted , it 's being highlighted . ''\nAfter withdrawing his election night concession last weekend , Gillum in Florida hammered home the message in both interviews with national liberal outlets and to supporters across the state .\nOn Tuesday night at St. Mark AME Church in Orlando , Gillum , whose term as Tallahassee mayor ends next week , cast the stakes of the ongoing recount efforts -- and his push to find and count every valid vote -- in imposing historical terms .\n`` We 've got to demand a more perfect union , we have to demand a process that is more fair , '' Gillum said . `` We have to reject the belief that a signature difference is enough for somebody 's entire vote to be dismissed . We 've got to get rid of these arbitrary deadlines . ''\nNelson 's recount effort has raised $ 2.5 million off a string of emails from top Democratic lawmakers . Republican Gov . Rick Scott , his challenger and the leader in their tight race , brought in just $ 1.4 million over the same period . The spread has also confirmed for Democratic leaders that their vaunted small-dollar donor base remains fired up and ready to spend on candidates willing to fight -- even when the odds are against them .\nGillum refused to re-concede his race on Thursday despite the completion -- in all but one county -- of a machine recount that confirmed Republican Ron DeSantis 's lead . In a statement , Gillum pointed to both failures by some counties deliver updated results and arguments made by Democrats in court as his reason for continuing on .\n`` Voters need to know that their decision to participate in this election , and every election , matters , '' he said . `` It is not over until every legally-cast vote is counted . ''\nBut Gillum 's message to voters hints at sharper anxieties shared by Democrats around the country : that voters will be discouraged by the unfolding events in Florida and Georgia , and turnout numbers , up this year , will drop again . Abrams , in a fiery speech on Friday evening , first ended her campaign for governor , then announced the creation of a new voting rights PAC that in the coming days plans to launch what she described as a `` major federal lawsuit against the state of Georgia for the gross mismanagement of this election and to protect future elections from unconstitutional actions . ''\nAbrams also leveled another round of stinging accusations against her GOP rival , former Secretary of State Brian Kemp , saying that under his watch , `` democracy failed Georgia . ''\n`` Georgia still has a decision to make about who will we be in the next election . And the one after that . And the one after that , '' Abrams said , looking ahead that next round of races . `` So we have used this election and its aftermath to diagnose what has been broken in our process . ''\nDemocrats worry that anything less than a robust and well-funded fight in the aftermath of these contested 2018 elections will encourage President Donald Trump and loyal elected officials like Kemp , who over nearly a decade as Georgia 's chief elections officials helped set in place the rules for a gubernatorial contest he would both run in and oversee .\nKemp stepped down from his position after the voting , and most of the vote-counting , was over . But on the Sunday before Election Day , his office lobbed baseless charges of voter database hacking at Georgia Democrats , while his campaign piled on -- creating a confusing swirl of accusations that , given Kemp 's day job , might have appeared to carry more weight than those of typical , if outlandish , claims by a candidate .\nTrump is a good bet , if his first campaign was any indication , to employ similar tactics in the run-up to -- and , potentially , the aftermath of -- the 2020 election . That his conspiratorial comments about the Florida election have been so easily adopted by the previously Trump-shy Scott -- who was admonished by a federal judge for `` ( toeing ) the line between imprudent campaign trail rhetoric and problematic state action '' -- is viewed by voting rights advocates as a sign of things to come .\n`` This is President Trump laying the groundwork for 2020 , to make sure his supporters will call into question the results of the election if he does n't win , '' Rakov said . `` He 's using this situation to further himself . He does n't care about having one more senator in Washington , he just wants people to start getting the idea that election results are n't real . ''\nOn Wednesday , both Trump and Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz , one of his most ardent backers on Capitol Hill , took turns trying to stoke fears over Democratic efforts in Florida .\nThe President sent a fundraising email with a subject line , `` NON-CITIZENS VOTING ? '' and a claim below that `` Democrats are trying to overturn our Republican victories in Florida . ''\nGaetz , meanwhile , in an interview with Breitbart , claimed Nelson 's ongoing court challenges were the precursor to a presidential heist .\n`` If the Democrats are able to learn now what techniques work and do n't work , what transparency laws are going to be followed and which ones are n't , then it gives them a road map on how to steal the election from Donald Trump in 2020 , '' he said .\nIn an interview after Gaetz 's comments began to spread , Maryland Democratic Rep. John Sarbanes , pointing to new legislation being crafted by House Democrats , offered a more mundane explanation .\n`` What we 're trying to do is create a roadmap for how to protect people 's vote and their voice everywhere in this country , '' Sarbanes said . `` If we can learn something from challenging these deficiencies in our voting process ( in Florida ) and our voting system in this country , you 're putting together a handbook not to steal elections but to have elections be an accurate reflection of the will and the voice of the people . ''\nSarbanes and other Democrats will introduce a host of `` democracy reforms '' to kick off the new Congress . One key piece is automatic voter registration , which would add eligible voters to the rolls unless they chose to opt out .\nWith Republicans adding to their majority in the Senate , the Democratic-backed measure is a near-lock to disappear once it reaches the upper chamber . Sarbanes understands the math but is hoping the optics will prompt a backlash against the Senate GOP and , eventually , the President .\n`` If you come with a strong , big bang declaration right out of the gate , the fact that Mitch McConnell and the Republican Senate ignore it just makes the contrast even clearer , '' Sarbanes said .\nThe argument to voters , he added , was this : `` You gave us the gavel in the House and we showed that you that we 're committed to those things . Give us the gavel in the Senate and we 'll do it there . Give us a pen in the White House and we 'll do it there . ''",
