Both Democrats and Republicans who voted for Trump gave him positive marks \u2013 a B-plus or A-minus \u2013 although many supporters said the clock is ticking for the president to deliver on tax reform and other promises .\n\u201c The people who were for Trump and who supported him and voted for him are still 100 % behind him , \u201d said John Morganelli , the Democratic county district attorney who has been re-elected six times ( and who declined to say whom he voted for last November ) . \u201c So I think if the election was held again today , in Northampton County there \u2019 s a good chance that Trump would carry this county again . And it might be slightly closer , but I think that he would probably do well . \u201d\nNorthampton was not supposed to jump for Trump in 2016 . The Hillary Clinton campaign was so confident of victory here that it moved local operatives out of state , to North Carolina and elsewhere , in the run-up to the election .\nBut Trump \u2019 s promise to make America great again found unexpected traction in Northampton , among Democratic voters who remembered the heyday of Bethlehem steel , once a local symbol of national strength , or who sensed , they say , that Clinton did not truly care about their lives and challenges .\nTrump won here by four points . To hear many voters in Northampton tell it , he would do the same tomorrow .\n\u201c It \u2019 s only 100 days , \u201d said Christy Facciponti , 54 , a former engineer at Bethlehem Steel , who was flying a Trump flag outside her home in Nazareth , Pennsylvania , last week . \u201c Please , give him a second . He \u2019 s already done more than Obama ever did . \u201d\nThe little fat boy over there , I think he \u2019 s putting a set of manners on him . Barber Joe D \u2019 Ambrosio\nJoe D \u2019 Ambrosio , a barber in Bethlehem who changed his party registration from Democratic in 2016 to vote for Trump in the primary , praised the president \u2019 s conduct of foreign policy , especially his showdown with the North Korean leader , Kim Jong-un .\n\u201c Trump tells the strongest guys in town , if you want to mess with him , he \u2019 ll mess with you , \u201d D \u2019 Ambrosio said . \u201c And the little fat boy over there , I think he \u2019 s putting a set of manners on him . \u201d\nBruce Haines , a Republican former steel executive who runs the Historic Hotel Bethlehem , praised Trump \u2019 s installation of Neil Gorsuch on the supreme court and said support for the president in the business community was robust .\nHealth insurance woes helped elect Trump , but his cure may be more painful Read more\n\u201c The divisions are as strong as they were on election night , \u201d Haines said . \u201c The Trump people are just as supportive of Trump as they were on election night , and the anti-Trump voters are probably stronger against \u2013 there isn \u2019 t anything that guy \u2019 s going to do to get the Hillary voters . They \u2019 re just not going to accept anything . \u201d\nBut even Trump \u2019 s strongest supporters say the clock is ticking for the president to sign major legislation in multiple areas , no matter how out to lunch Congress may be .\n\u201c Goodness sakes alive , Republicans have run on tax reform as long as I can remember , and we don \u2019 t seem to get it , \u201d said Lee Snover , a Republican activist who is a kind of Patient Zero for Trump support in Northampton . \u201c I mean I \u2019 ve got a Republican House , and a Republican Senate and a Republican president , and I still don \u2019 t have lower taxes ? So I \u2019 m really having a difficult time internalizing that , coming to grips with that and accepting that . I really am .\nAs the dogwoods and magnolias bloomed and lawnmowers came out across Northampton county , interviews with Trump voters did reveal some pockets of discontent with the president , especially among people who said they had backed him on an impulse , or who had expected him to do more , sooner .\nMarie Claire Placide is a two-time Obama voter whose dress shop in Bangor , in the north of the county , is going out of business . She voted for Trump , she said , \u201c because I know he \u2019 s a businessman , and , you know , he used to be a Democrat \u201d .\n\u201c So I chose him , \u201d Placide said . \u201c I even had some Democrat friends angry \u2013 \u2018 Why were you voting for Trump ? \u2019 I said it \u2019 s a free country . I vote for who I want . \u201d\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 asked Placide , who was naturalized as an American citizen in 1990 and who works an evening shift for a nursing agency to put her two children through college , whether she thought Trump had made America great again .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t watch the news any more , \u201d Placide continued . \u201c I \u2019 m not interested any more . After the election , I didn \u2019 t watch the news . \u201d\nAround the corner from Placide \u2019 s soon-to-be-shuttered shop sits Miller \u2019 s Paint and Wallpaper , a local mainstay since 1923 . Duane Miller , the 79-year-old owner and a Democrat , was mayor of Bangor from 1974 to 1990 .\n\u201c As a very last-minute voter , I voted for Trump , \u201d Miller said . \u201c My first reaction was that Hillary would be the president and was unbeatable , you know , and there would be no problem . Having said that , my customers here , I was extremely surprised to find how many voted for Donald Trump . And it was almost as a protest .\n\u201c It \u2019 s the disillusionment of the common man with government , because government has done nothing to help the average working man . \u201d\nMiller said that he had detected a provisional fall-off in enthusiasm for Trump around town , and he said that if the election were held in Bangor tomorrow , there was a chance Trump might lose .\nTrump loyalists stand by their man \u2013 but the resistance is taking root Read more\n\u201c There \u2019 s been a change , but how much I \u2019 m not sure , \u201d Miller said . \u201c In other words , people are saying , well , \u2018 I don \u2019 t agree with Trump that he did this , or I don \u2019 t agree with that. \u2019 But not to a big factor . The factor is , \u2018 I voted for Trump , but I \u2019 m not sure I should have , \u2019 would be the best way to say it . \u201d\nMelissa Hough runs the Slate Belt Heritage Center in Bangor , which showcases the region \u2019 s once-thriving slate quarries and the historic immigration flows that shaped its diverse labor pool .\nAs the 100-day mark approached , Hough said : \u201c I think the support remains . \u201d\n\u201c The economy improved elsewhere , \u201d she said . \u201c It didn \u2019 t improve here , so I think a lot of people blamed the government , because that \u2019 s what they heard on TV , and they do not blame the factors closest to them \u2013 like the companies they worked for , the corporations . \u201d\nMiller said voters had noticed that Trump has not repealed Obama \u2019 s healthcare law , has not started construction on a border wall and has not enacted tax reform .\nOn health reform , Miller says , \u201c he promised a promise he can \u2019 t keep \u201d . \u201c And other things he promised , he can \u2019 t keep . So how will that come out in the long run ? If it continues that he can \u2019 t keep these promises , or some of them , then we won \u2019 t have a Republican president next time .\n\u201c If he can \u2019 t produce , then he \u2019 ll be as bad as Hillary . \u201d\nBack down south , in Bethlehem , D \u2019 Ambrosio , the barber , pointed out a bumper sticker someone had left on his car , which already had a Trump sticker . The anonymously gifted sticker read : \u201c Trump 2016 : Finally someone with balls ! \u201d\n\u201c I think my customers , they \u2019 re all behind him , \u201d D \u2019 Ambrosio said .\n\u201c I knew you were coming , so I did a little survey this week . And I said to everybody , \u2018 This guy \u2019 s gon na come from \u2588\u2588\u2588 , and is gon na ask these questions. \u2019 I said , \u2018 What do you want me to tell him ? \u2019\nD \u2019 Ambrosio said that some customers faulted Trump for using Twitter too much , but the reception for his cabinet appointments , his leadership style and particularly for his military actions had been \u201c very positive \u201d .\n\u201c He jumped in polls , \u201d the barber said . \u201c Why did he jump in polls ? Because he showed strength . And listened to the people he put in charge . \u2018 Cause hell , he \u2019 s no general .\n\u201c He doesn \u2019 t have to know everything about everything , because you know , he doesn \u2019 t walk on water . But as long as he \u2019 s a good administrator , and he picks good people , and he works with them , that \u2019 s what we want . \u201d\nSnover , the Republican activist , said people took confidence from what they perceived as Trump \u2019 s projection of power .\n\u201c I think the people have a lot more confidence in America , \u201d Snover said . \u201c They \u2019 re losing fear and they \u2019 re gaining courage , especially from the military positions he \u2019 s taken . His overall theme , that we \u2019 re powerful , has made Americans feel encouraged \u2013 they feel confident . I think he \u2019 s brought on that feeling . \u201d\nHaines , the hotel owner , said he gave Trump an A-minus on the strength of the Gorsuch appointment to the supreme court , but added that the president needed to reach across the aisle to close deals on healthcare reform and tax cuts .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t really have a strike against him , \u201d Haines said . \u201c I would encourage him to try and find some moderate Democrats that he can schmooze . \u201d\nSnover said that , for now , Congress was catching the blame for whatever was not getting done .\n\u201c A lot of people , people in the party , are not blaming Trump for anything that \u2019 s not been accomplished , \u201d she said . \u201c They \u2019 re blaming Congress , including the Republicans , because they \u2019 ve been there longer and they \u2019 ve always been the problem . \u201d\nFacciponti , the Nazareth resident flying a Trump flag , sat down for a chat on her porch swing .\n\u201c We put it back up for the inauguration and kept it up , \u201d she said of the flag . If the election were held again today , she said , \u201c I think he \u2019 d win by more . \u201d\nA conversation about possible areas where Trump had fallen short quickly turned to what Facciponti said were the media \u2019 s efforts to tear down the president .\n\u201c The media just hates him , \u201d she said . \u201c It \u2019 s really sad . If the mainstream media would give him one-tenth of the chance they gave Obama , he would be so loved . It \u2019 s just sad that people \u2013 the Never Trumpers \u2013 that people are that stubborn . \u201d\nLarry Hallett , the owner of a restaurant and paving company outside Bangor , also thought that Trump \u2019 s good intentions and efforts to compromise had been undercut by antagonists in the media and the Washington establishment .\n\u201c I think he \u2019 s trying actually , I think he \u2019 s sincerely trying to get everybody together and try to use them all , but they \u2019 re making it very difficult for him . I really do , \u201d said Hallett .\n\u201c I think if the Democrats came up with something that was a very good decision , I think he would try everything , no matter how much it takes . The man I seem to know there would cherish all of them . \u201d\nMorganelli , the district attorney , said \u201c a lot of people \u201d agreed with that assessment .\n\u201c Everywhere I go , restaurants , I bump into folks , sometimes just in casual conversation , \u201d he said . \u201c It \u2019 s anecdotal evidence , but , \u2018 What do you think of Trump ? \u2019\n\u201c And over and over again , the people who voted for him say \u2018 Hey , I voted for him , I \u2019 m still thinking what he \u2019 s doing is right . \u2019\n\u201c There are a lot of people who agree that the media overall has been tough on him , maybe perhaps tougher than they have on other presidents . \u201d\nD \u2019 Ambrosio saw Trump \u2019 s clashes with the media as a sign of his tactical canniness .\n\u201c I think his big thing is unpredictability , and that \u2019 s the best thing that you could do . And that comes from negotiating , \u201d D \u2019 Ambrosio said .\n\u201c He throws the bait out with these tweets , and lets people chew on it . He knows what he \u2019 s going to do , he wasn \u2019 t born yesterday . He actually plays the game , and I think the press doesn \u2019 t know it , and they take the bait all the time .",

The man I seem to know there would cherish all of them.\u201d\n\nMorganelli, the district attorney, said \u201ca lot of people\u201d agreed with that assessment.\n\n\n\n\u201cEverywhere I go, restaurants, I bump into folks, sometimes just in casual conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s anecdotal evidence, but, \u2018What do you think of Trump?\u2019\n\n\u201cAnd over and over again, the people who voted for him say \u2018Hey, I voted for him, I\u2019m still thinking what he\u2019s doing is right.\u2019\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people who agree that the media overall has been tough on him, maybe perhaps tougher than they have on other presidents.\u201d\n\nD\u2019Ambrosio saw Trump\u2019s clashes with the media as a sign of his tactical canniness.\n\n\u201cI think his big thing is unpredictability, and that\u2019s the best thing that you could do. And that comes from negotiating,\u201d D\u2019Ambrosio said.\n\n\u201cHe throws the bait out with these tweets, and lets people chew on it. He knows what he\u2019s going to do, he wasn\u2019t born yesterday. He actually plays the game, and I think the press doesn\u2019t know it, and they take the bait all the time.\n\n\u201cThey really take the bait.\u201d\n\nSign up for regular email dispatches throughout the year to hear from Tom and the people of Northampton County",
