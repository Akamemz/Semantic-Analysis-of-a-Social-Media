    "content": "Embattled U.N . Ambassador Susan E. Rice withdrew her name Thursday from consideration to succeed Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton after months of criticism over her comments about the terrorist attack that killed four Americans in Benghazi , Libya , in September .\nAlthough the decision had been building for weeks , Mrs. Rice \u2019 s request was a stunning setback for President Obama , who angrily defended her in a November news conference and challenged the Republican critics that \u201c they should go after me \u201d over the handling of the Benghazi attack . Mrs. Rice is a longtime senior adviser on foreign policy for the president and had been seen as a front-runner for Foggy Bottom in his second term .\nRepublican Sens . John McCain of Arizona , Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and others had criticized Mrs. Rice \u2019 s appearances on a series of Sunday talk shows after the Sept. 11 Benghazi attack , which she repeatedly characterized as a largely spontaneous response to an anti-Islam film produced in the U.S. Several senators said they could not vote to confirm Mrs. Rice as secretary of state because of a lack of trust in her public statements .\nCritics argued that the administration had ample evidence by the time the ambassador went on television that terrorists linked to al Qaeda were responsible for the attack , which killed U.S . Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens , another State Department employee and two security workers . Mrs. Rice and others in the administration said she was simply relaying information gleaned by U.S. intelligence services at the time .\n\u201c If nominated , I am now convinced that the confirmation process would be lengthy , disruptive and costly \u2014 to you and to our most pressing national and international priorities , \u201d Mrs. Rice wrote in her letter to Mr. Obama , saying she was saddened by the partisanship over her candidacy . \u201c That trade-off is simply not worth it to our country . \u2026 Therefore , I respectfully request that you no longer consider my candidacy at this time . \u201d\nMr. Obama said in a statement Thursday that he is \u201c grateful \u201d that Mrs. Rice will remain in her post at the United Nations , and he decried the criticism of her as politically motivated .\n\u201c While I deeply regret the unfair and misleading attacks on Susan Rice in recent weeks , her decision demonstrates the strength of her character and an admirable commitment to rise above the politics of the moment to put our national interests first , \u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201c The American people can be proud to have a public servant of her caliber and character representing our country . \u201d\nRepublicans said Mrs. Rice made the right decision in backing out , as speculation turned to other candidates Mr. Obama might pick to succeed Mrs. Clinton , who plans to step down early next year .\n\u201c I respect Ambassador Rice \u2019 s decision , \u201d Mr. Graham said in a statement . \u201c President Obama has many talented people to choose from to serve as our next secretary of state . \u201d\nThe most prominently rumored candidate for secretary of state is Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John F. Kerry , Massachusetts Democrat .\nMr. Obama also was said to have been considering Mr. Kerry to replace Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta , but another candidate for the Pentagon job has emerged \u2014 former Sen.

The national security post , unlike secretary of state , does not require Senate confirmation .\nIn a brief statement , Mrs. Clinton seemed to hint that Mrs. Rice will stay with the Obama administration , saying she is confident Mrs. Rice \u201c will continue to represent the United States with strength and skill . \u201d\nSome congressional Democrats took a sharper tone about Thursday \u2019 s turn of events .\nRep. Karen Bass , California Democrat and a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , said Mrs. Rice was \u201c extraordinarily qualified \u201d to become secretary of state , and decried the campaign to block her nomination .\n\u201c It is unfortunate Ambassador Rice had to make this decision in the face of such unfounded and unfair character attacks , \u201d Ms. Bass said .\nSen.
