Ask most any third-grader : Just as Education Secretary Arne Duncan , the cheerleader in chief for the Common Core and rigorous standards , prepares to step down , the standards that naysayers love to call \u201c Obamacore \u201d have become the reality on the ground for roughly 40 million students \u2014 or about four out of every five public school kids .\nThe math and English standards designed to develop critical thinking have been guiding classrooms for years now , even as the political fight rages on in statehouses and on the campaign trail : Many of today \u2019 s textbooks , workbooks , software and tests are designed to teach the oft-bashed academic standards and measure whether students are meeting them . The federal Education Department gave them a big boost but never required them , nor can it .\nIn more than half of all states , millions of students took new standardized tests last spring based on the standards , and the expected uproar over these test scores has n't materialized . The conspiracy theories that Common Core would require monitoring kids via iris scans , force teachers to use porn to help students learn to read or ban teaching cursive have largely quieted .\nAfter years of hand-wringing , very few of the 45 states that fully adopted the standards have attempted a clean break \u2014 and those that did found it wasn \u2019 t easy to do . In Indiana , where Republican Gov . Mike Pence signed a bill last year to ditch the standards , even Common Core haters have said the new ones are just the same standards by a different name .\n\u201c The few states that have rolled it back , when you look at what they \u2019 ve actually done , the standards they are using are 95 percent the Core standards .
