'' The plaintiffs have filed a complaint against Trump and two of his supporters , Trump 's attorneys have filed a motion to dismiss the case , but the judge has yet to rule .

Trump has not been deposed in the case and no trial date has been set .\nFinally , a former Trump campaign staffer claims that Trump 's North Carolina State Director pulled a gun on him , and the campaign did nothing about it after the staffer reported the incident . Described in the complaint as a `` passionate '' Trump supporter , Vincent Bordini sued the Trump campaign and Earl Phillip , the state director , in August , asserting several causes of action , including battery , intentional infliction of emotional distress , and negligent supervision .

Both Donald and Eric Trump were deposed in the matter , it went to trial before a judge in August , and the parties are awaiting a ruling .\nIn an unrelated case , a woman filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Jupiter in June , alleging she endured persistent unwelcome advances from the Food and Beverage Director of the club , and was then retaliated against for reporting him . The parties have submitted a joint scheduling order proposing a December 2017 trial date in that matter .\nThen there is the case of a former maintenance worker at the Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey who claimed he faced intense harassment after coming out to his co-workers as gay , including having golf balls and rocks `` routinely '' thrown at him , according to court papers .\nThe soon-to-be First Lady has not shied away from lawsuits herself . Last fall , Melania Trump threatened to sue People magazine for an article accusing her husband of forcing himself on a reporter .\nThen in September , she sued the Daily Mail for defamatory statements about her supposedly having been an `` escort '' in the 1990s . The paper printed a retraction , but the lawsuit appears to be moving full steam ahead , with Melania Trump seeking $ 150 million in damages and even making an in-person appearance at a routine court hearing earlier this month .\nThe next status conference in the case is scheduled for January 27 -- just one week after Donald Trump 's inauguration .",
