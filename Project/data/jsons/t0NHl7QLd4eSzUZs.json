    "content": "There are few constants in the presidential primary , but the order in which early states vote is roughly set in stone : first Iowa , then New Hampshire and then either Nevada or South Carolina , depending on the party . This is critical to how candidates operate in a presidential primary because what happens in one state can influence what happens in the next state to vote . Knowing this , campaigns often tailor their strategies to how they can best contend in each individual state , emphasizing the early-voting states as they try to advance deeper into the primary .\nThis is why it is important to know how candidates are faring in each state , rather than just how they are performing nationally . We \u2019 re about six months away from the first nomination contest in Iowa , but a look at the number of surveys conducted in each state gives us a window into which states are \u2014 and aren \u2019 t \u2014 being polled enough based on their position on the primary calendar . With the addition of an Iowa survey by Monmouth University released on Thursday , Iowa now has more Democratic presidential primary polls than any other state thus far in the 2020 cycle \u2014 22 surveys . But while Iowa leads the way , another early-voting state , Nevada , has been surveyed just three times ! Granted , Iowa does hold the first caucus , but even states like South Carolina , California and Texas , which go after Nevada , have been polled far more . And yes , each of these states could host a crucial contest , but so could Nevada !\nWhere are those Nevada polls ? Number of state primary polls for the 2020 Democratic presidential primary , as of Aug. 8 , 2019 Date State Number of polls Feb. 3 Iowa 22 \u2013 Feb. 11 New Hampshire 21 \u2013 Feb. 22 Nevada 3 \u2013 Feb. 29 South Carolina 17 \u2013 Mar . 3 California 14 \u2013 Texas 9 \u2013 Massachusetts 3 \u2013 Alabama 2 \u2013 North Carolina 2 \u2013 Virginia 2 \u2013 Colorado 1 \u2013 Maine 1 \u2013 Minnesota 1 \u2013 Tennessee 1 \u2013 Later in March Florida 9 \u2013 Michigan 4 \u2013 Mississippi 2 \u2013 Ohio 2 \u2013 Arizona 1 \u2013 Georgia 1 \u2013 Illinois 1 \u2013 Missouri 1 \u2013 Washington 1 \u2013 April Pennsylvania 5 \u2013 Wisconsin 3 \u2013 New York 1 \u2013 May Indiana 1 \u2013 Oregon 1 \u2013 Some dates of state primaries or caucuses are still tentative and may change . The table does not include polls from any pollsters banned by \u2588\u2588\u2588 . States not listed here do not yet have any polls for the Democratic contest in the 2020 cycle . Source : Polls , Frontloading HQ\nHowever , the dearth of polls in Nevada isn \u2019 t anything new . The Silver State only became an early state in the 2008 nomination process , and it \u2019 s struggled since then to attract pollsters \u2019 attention . In 2008 , at the same point that we are at now \u2014 about six months before Iowa \u2014 just 3 percent of the state-level Democratic and GOP primary polls had come from Nevada . During the 2012 Republican primary , about 5 percent of state-level polls were from Nevada six months before Iowa . And by that point in 2016 , only 3 percent of Democratic polls and 2 percent of GOP polls came from there . For comparison , the three polls conducted up to this point in the 2020 cycle equal just 2 percent of all state-level surveys .\nOne reason for the lack of polls is that it \u2019 s hard to poll Nevada . The caucuses aren \u2019 t as embedded in the state \u2019 s political fabric as contests in other early states \u2014 Iowa \u2019 s caucuses have led since 1972 , New Hampshire has held the first primary since 1920 and South Carolina \u2019 s \u201c First in the South \u201d primary dates back to 1980 on the Republican side . And considering caucuses have lower turnout than primaries , it \u2019 s challenging for pollsters to survey participants , too , especially given Nevada \u2019 s fairly transient population and the unusual hours many residents work because of the state \u2019 s hotel and gaming industries . All of this makes it difficult \u2014 and costly \u2014 for pollsters to survey Nevada caucus-goers .\nNevertheless , veteran Nevada political journalist Jon Ralston isn \u2019 t totally buying the claims that Nevada is too tough to survey more regularly . \u201c I think ultimately it \u2019 s a cop-out by pollsters and by others , \u201d he told me . But Ralston also senses that the campaigns and media aren \u2019 t giving Nevada its due either . \u201c I don \u2019 t think people take us as seriously as an early state as they take Iowa and New Hampshire , who have been there forever , \u201d he said . Nevada may be the frontier of polling , but a state with this much say early in the nomination process should be surveyed more .\nMorning Consult has released its monthly numbers on President Trump \u2019 s approval rating in each of the 50 states , finding that he had a net negative approval rating ( approval rating minus disapproval rating ) in 30 states in July . Trump was underwater in all three states that made the difference in the 2016 election : Michigan ( -11 ) , Pennsylvania ( -8 ) and Wisconsin ( -14 ) .\nA new report from the Pew Research Center found that Americans remain supportive of separation of powers in government , but perhaps less solidly than before . Pew \u2019 s polling showed that 66 percent felt it was \u201c too risky \u201d to give the president more power to tackle many of the country \u2019 s problems while 29 percent said that the country could more effectively handle problems if presidents \u201c didn \u2019 t have to worry so much about Congress or the courts. \u201d Back in 2018 , 76 percent felt giving the president more power was too risky and 21 percent said presidents could operate more effectively if they had less concern about Congress and the courts . Most of the change comes from Republicans : 70 percent said in 2018 that they opposed giving more power to the president , but only 51 percent did in the new poll . By comparison , Democrats saw virtually no change : 82 percent said they felt it was too risky versus 83 percent in 2018 .\nNorth Carolina could be a key battleground state in the 2020 general election , and SurveyUSA has some early head-to-head numbers for Trump against different Democratic contenders . Trump performed worst against former Vice President Joe Biden , earning 41 percent support to Biden \u2019 s 49 percent . Trump also trailed Sen. Bernie Sanders by 4 points and Sen. Elizabeth Warren by 1 point , but he led Sen. Kamala Harris by 1 point and Pete Buttigieg , mayor of South Bend , Indiana , by 2 points .\nIn their weekly poll , The Economist and YouGov found a clear partisan divide over what statistic best measures Trump \u2019 s economic performance as president . Forty-five percent of Republicans felt \u201c the unemployment rate and jobs reports \u201d are the best way to judge Trump \u2019 s work on the economy , while only 16 percent preferred \u201c the prices of goods and services you buy \u201d ( the remainder answered \u201c the stock market index , \u201d \u201c personal finances \u201d or didn \u2019 t know ) . Meanwhile , 36 percent of Democrats said the price of goods and services are the most important way to rate the president \u2019 s economic performance compared to 19 percent who preferred the unemployment rate and jobs reports ( the remaining respondents chose one of the other three options ) .\nMorning Consult also asked Americans about whether 99 different activities ought to be considered sports and what attributes are most important to determining whether an activity is a sport . For example , Americans uniformly agreed that basketball is a sport \u2014 97 percent said it was \u2014 but were divided over how to define miniature golf . Fifty-two percent said it was a sport , while 46 percent said it wasn \u2019 t . The polls also found a nearly even three-way split over what aspect is most important in determining if something is a sport : 34 percent said the physical effort required , 34 percent said the skill involved in playing and 32 percent said the competitive element of the activity .\nEver wondered what Americans \u2019 preferred sandwich is ? YouGov recently found that 79 percent of Americans \u201c really like \u201d or \u201c somewhat like \u201d a grilled cheese , which tops the list of 15 sandwich options . Bringing up the rear was the French dip , with 46 percent of respondents expressing fondness for it .\nAccording to \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s presidential approval tracker , 42.1 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president , while 53.2 percent disapprove ( a net approval rating of -11.1 points ) . At this time last week , 42.5 percent approved and 52.9 percent disapproved ( for a net approval rating of -10.4 points ) . One month ago , Trump had an approval rating of 42.6 percent and a disapproval rating of 52.5 percent , for a net approval rating of -9.9 points .\nIn our average of polls of the generic congressional ballot , Democrats currently lead by 6.2 percentage points ( 46.1 percent to 39.9 percent ) . A week ago , Democrats led Republicans by 6.1 points ( 46.1 percent to 40.0 percent ) . At this time last month , voters preferred Democrats by 6.2 points ( 46.3 percent to 40.1 percent ) .",
