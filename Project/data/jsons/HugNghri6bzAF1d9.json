He behaved less like an affectionate pal than a guy getting paid to do a job , a pet employee reassuring disgruntled co-workers that their unpopular boss was actually a great guy , really , if only you guys got to know him .\nIn the end you got the sense that Pence did as much ( maybe more ) to burnish his own brand than Trump \u2019 s \u2013 and even if he \u2019 s widely deemed the winner , what lasting good will it do for his undisciplined , self-defeating nominee ? Here are five takeaways .\n1 . Hillary Clinton is lucky she \u2019 s facing Trump instead of Pence . Even after having his leonine head handed to him at the first presidential debate last week , there \u2019 s no decisive evidence that Trump is taking prep for Sunday \u2019 s second round in St. Louis any more seriously than he took prep for the first . The same can not be said for Pence , a true professional , who huddled with Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker for a week , and produced a focused performance , parrying every attack with a sharp assault on the unholy trinity of Clinton sins : emails , the foundation and her foreign policy failings as secretary of state .\nPence was as un-goad-able as Trump was easily gulled . When an aggressive Kaine demanded he defend his running mate \u2019 s comments on everything from declaring Mexican immigrants \u201c rapists \u201d to Trump \u2019 s suggestion that the U.S. encourage other countries to develop nukes , Pence mocked him . \u201c Did you work on that one a long time ? Because that had a lot of creative lines in it . \u201d\nIn the real world outside the Farmville , Va. debate hall , Pence has contradicted or contrasted himself from Trump on any number of issues \u2013 most notably his flat refusal to entertain the false assertion that President Obama isn \u2019 t a native-born citizen . But inside he did a far better job of making Trump \u2019 s case than the candidate has made on his own behalf .\nDuring his Hofstra meltdown Trump was so occupied defending himself against the self-assured Clinton he forgot his most effective attacks , including a much-anticipated hit on the fundraising practices of the Clinton Foundation . Pence was a cooler customer who calmly went through his head-hunting to-do list .\n\u201c While she was secretary of state , the Clinton foundation accepted tens of millions of dollars from foreign governments , and foreign donors , '' he said \u2013 precisely the kind of targeted attack Trump needs to make in order to recover from his disastrous first debate .\nAlec Baldwin studied Trump for weeks to pull off his uncanny impersonation on last week \u2019 s Saturday Night Live . Trump would be well served to study the YouTube of Pence \u2019 s performance for pointers .\n2 . Tim Kaine wasn \u2019 t trying to win the debate \u2013 he was trying to bash Trump . The Virginia senator has a reputation for being a nice guy , but he was given a hit man \u2019 s job on Tuesday . And the target was Trump , not Pence , whom the Clinton campaign regards as a political bit player who will vanish into obscurity after the election .\nHence , Kaine \u2019 s task was a slightly awkward one : to aim over Pence and hit Trump . It didn \u2019 t really work , and not for lack of trying .\nHis best moment , arguably , came when he produced a laundry list of awful things Trump has said about women , Mexicans and a disabled reporter ; Pence juked and refused to answer \u2013 which allowed Kaine to declare : \u201c He 's refused to defend his running mate . . .and yet , he 's asking everybody to vote for somebody that he can not defend , '' he said in one of the debate \u2019 s few memorable exchanges .\nBut he came off as a bit nervous , like a frustrated school kid trying to disgorge a memorized speech if only his rowdy classmates would allow him to deliver it . At times , he seemed peevish . Pence actually interrupted Kaine a lot , but his interjections were punchy ( often an aspirated \u201c no ! \u201d intended to deprive the former Virginia governor a clean sound bite ) while Kaine \u2019 s frequent attempts to be heard were of the whiny it \u2019 s-my-turn-to-talk variety which had many viewers ( and a focus group convened by GOP pollster Frank Luntz ) judging Kaine to be rude .\n3 . Snatching discord from the jaws of victory ? Clinton and her brain trust , according to several Democrats I spoke to , were satisfied ( if not elated ) by Kaine \u2019 s performance . Whether Trump appreciated Pence \u2019 s defenses , well that \u2019 s less clear . Moments after the candidates left the stage , John Harwood of CNBC and The New York Times quoted a Trump adviser saying that the GOP nominee , who was watching the debate from a hotel in Vegas , was less than satisfied with his running mate .\n\u201c Pence won overall , but he didn \u2019 t win with Trump , \u201d the adviser told Harwood .\n4 . Pence dodged almost every tough question . How do you defend a running mate much of America deems as indefensible ? You don \u2019 t !\nTrump \u2019 s chorus of validators fanned out this week to declare him a \u201c genius \u201d for \u201c using \u201d the tax code to avoid paying taxes \u2013 but the real genius may have been Pence who figured out the best way to answer the thorniest questions about Trump was to respond with an attack on Kaine , or the moderator Elaine Quijano .
