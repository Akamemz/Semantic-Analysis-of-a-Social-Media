    "content": "Yesterday , the US Supreme Court granted the federal government \u2019 s emergency request to stay an injunction in an Illinois case about the \u201c public charge \u201d rule in immigration . The order came with no explanation from most\u2014not those in favor or opposed\u2014just a vote count and a a damning dissent ( pdf ) from justice Sonia Sotomayor .\nThe five conservatives on the bench approved the government \u2019 s request and the four progressives voted no . Sotomayor accused her colleagues in the majority of undermining fairness and process by continually granting the Trump administration \u2019 s allegedly urgent demands .\n\u201c Claiming one emergency after another , the Government has recently sought stays in an unprecedented number of cases , demanding immediate attention and consuming limited Court resources in each . And with each successive application , of course , its cries of urgency ring increasingly hollow , \u201d Sotomayor writes .\nBut the disingenuous alarm isn \u2019 t what bothers her most . \u201c Perhaps most troublingly , the Court \u2019 s recent behavior on stay applications has benefited one litigant over all others , \u201d she notes .\nThat litigant is the federal government under president Donald Trump . Though she didn \u2019 t name the president in her dissent , the justice is clearly unimpressed with the Trump administration \u2019 s exceptional neediness , and even less taken with her colleagues \u2019 willingness to be its supreme enforcers .\nIt \u2019 s not the first time Sotomayor has complained about the administration \u2019 s reliance on emergency action , and she \u2019 s not alone in seeing a disturbing practice emerging .\nUniversity of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck wrote in the Harvard Law Review last year about the high court \u2019 s unusually active \u201c shadow docket. \u201d The federal government now turns to the justices for emergency relief , circumventing the usual appellate process , more than ever before . It doesn \u2019 t wait for lower courts to decide matters but goes straight to the top , claiming extraordinary needs\u2014often with little supporting evidence\u2014and has created this alternate docket , a shadow caseload the high court continually considers prematurely .\nDuring the first 30 months of the Trump administration , the government sought emergency or extraordinary relief from the Supreme Court with \u201c unprecedented frequency , \u201d Vladeck argues . It applied for at least 20 emergency stays , filed petitions for review before judgment in nine cases , and sought writs of mandamus against three judges . That \u2019 s a stark contrast to the past 16 years , during which the government sought only eight stays total , four reviews before judgment , and no mandamus writs .\nVladeck , like Sotomayor , partly blames the court for the uptick in action . \u201c [ T ] he Justices have largely acquiesced in the [ government \u2019 s ] newfound aggressiveness , \u201d the professor writes .
