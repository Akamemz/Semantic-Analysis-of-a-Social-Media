    "content": "Donald Sterling , in all his reprehensible anti-glory , is officially representative of only one person , Donald Sterling . But it was hard not to think about the insularity and cossetting the super-wealthy enjoy , once they get super-wealthy , watching the maligned Los Angeles Clippers owner self-destruct with Anderson Cooper Monday night .\nSterling is a man who is obviously used to holding forth on his mind-blowingly prejudiced views without challenge . He wants us to think V. Stiviano entrapped him with her magic lady parts -- \u201c I don \u2019 t know why the girl had me say those things , \u201d he told Cooper -- and got him to launch a paranoid racist rant out of lust . But clearly that is not true , unless he \u2019 s lusting after Anderson Cooper .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not a racist , \u201d Sterling told Cooper . \u201c I made a terrible , terrible mistake . And I \u2019 m here with you today to apologize and to ask for forgiveness for all the people that I \u2019 ve hurt . When I listen to that tape , I do n't even know how I can say words like that .... I mean , that 's not the way I talk. \u201d Actually , it seems to be exactly the way Sterling talks .\nIt \u2019 s hard to know where to start with the NBA franchise owner \u2019 s outrageous remarks . He called Stiviano \u201c a street person \u201d and said Magic Johnson \u201c ought to be ashamed of himself. \u201d No , that doesn \u2019 t do Sterling justice . This is what he said about Johnson :\nHere is a man , he acts so holy . He made love to every girl in America in every city and he had AIDS . When he had those AIDS , I went to my synagogue and I prayed for him .\n\u201c Those AIDS \u201d ? ( For the record , Johnson has HIV , not AIDS ) . But it got worse :\nWhat has Magic Johnson done ? He 's got AIDS . Did he do any business ? Did he help anybody in south L.A. ? I think he should be ashamed of himself . What does he do for the black people ? I 'm telling you he does nothing . It 's all talk . I spent millions on giving away and helping minorities . Does he do that ? That 's one problem I have . Jews , when they get successful , they will help their people . And some of the African-Americans , maybe I 'll get in trouble again . They do n't want to help anybody . What has Magic Johnson really done for Children 's Hospital which kids are lying in the hallways . They are sick . They need a bed . What has he done for any hospital ? What has he done for any group ?\nFor the record , Magic Johnson has a foundation that gives away almost $ 2 million a year and got a four-star rating by Charity Navigator last year . A recent Los Angeles Times investigation found little evidence of the Donald Sterling Foundation \u2019 s good work . He does reportedly give a lot of money to women he \u2019 s trying to bed .\nFor his part , Johnson replied an hour after the interview aired :\nMaybe Sterling thought his sit-down with Cooper would help him rehabilitate himself , but at one point he even turned on Cooper . When the CNN anchor suggested that Sterling \u2019 s paternalistic comments about his players , that \u201c I support them and give them food , and clothes , and cars , and houses , \u201d had been criticized as reflecting a plantation mentality , Sterling turned on his host : \u201c I think you have more of a plantation mentality than I do .
