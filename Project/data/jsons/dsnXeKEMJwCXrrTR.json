It also leaves `` Obamacare '' in place , despite his assertion that the tax plan repeals the health care law . Nothing about the plan provides the fuel to achieve economic growth at the levels he 's predicted .\nTrump 's penchant for exaggeration and sometimes pure fiction has clouded the realities of the overhaul as it has shaped up over months . As for Democrats , you would n't know to hear them talk that middle-class people are getting a tax cut out of the deal , too .\nA look at remarks made Wednesday and earlier about the tax plan Trump will shortly sign into law .\nPRES . TRUMP : `` It 's the largest tax cut in the history of our country . '' \u2014 remarks Wednesday .\nTHE FACTS : It is n't . For months Trump has refused to recognize larger tax cuts in history , of which there have been many , or to grant that other presidents have enacted big tax cuts since Ronald Reagan in the 1980s .\nAn October analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that it would be the eighth biggest since 1918 . As a percentage of the total economy , Reagan 's 1981 cut is the biggest followed by the 1945 rollback of taxes that financed World War II . Trump 's plan is also smaller than cuts in 1948 , 1964 and 1921 , and probably in other years .\nValued at $ 1.5 trillion over 10 years , the plan is indeed large and expensive . But it 's much smaller than originally intended . Back in the spring , it was shaping up as a $ 5.5 trillion package . Even then it would have only been the third largest since 1940 as a share of gross domestic product .\nVICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE : `` You 're delivering on that middle-class miracle . '' \u2014 to Trump at a Cabinet meeting Wednesday .\nTHE FACTS : Modest does n't make for a miracle . Pence 's praise to the boss reflects Trump 's assertion that `` it 's a tax bill for the middle class , '' as he put it earlier and many times , but average people are not the prime beneficiaries of the tax cuts . Aside from businesses , rich people get the most .\nThe nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates the biggest benefit of the new law will go to households making $ 308,000 to $ 733,000 . Households making over that should get a tax cut worth 3.4 percent of their after-tax income . For the richest 0.1 percent ( making over $ 3.4 million ) , the tax cut should be worth 2.7 percent of their after-tax income . For middle-income earners : 1.6 percent , the center estimates .\nMoreover , only high-income people would get a meaningful tax cut after 2025 , when nearly all of the plan 's individual income tax provisions are due to expire .\nRepublicans argue that the middle class will also see benefits from the business tax cuts , in the form of more jobs and higher wages .\nDEMOCRATIC SEN. CHARLES SCHUMER : `` Their bill increases taxes on lots of middle-class people . ... According to the Tax Policy Center , the top one percent of earners in our country gets 83 percent of the benefits . '' \u2014 remarks Tuesday .\nTHE FACTS : The tax cuts are not nearly as lopsided as many Democrats are portraying them . Almost all of the middle class would initially pay less in taxes .\nFor the next eight years , the vast majority of middle-class taxpayers \u2014 those earning between $ 49,000 and $ 86,000 \u2014 will receive a tax cut , albeit a small one . In 2018 , nine-tenths of the middle class will get a cut , according to the Tax Policy Center . In 2025 , 87 percent will . The tax cut wo n't be very big : just $ 930 next year for the middle one-fifth of taxpayers , the center 's analysis concludes . For those paid twice a month , that 's about $ 40 a paycheck .\nSchumer and other Democrats are basing their assertions on the fact that nearly all personal tax cuts expire after 2025 , which would result in a slight tax increase for about two-thirds of the middle class by 2027 . The top 1 percent would still get a cut that year .\nOnly in 2027 do the wealthiest taxpayers get 83 percent of the benefit , as Schumer says . In 2018 , roughly 21 percent of the tax cut 's benefits go to the richest 1 percent , a much smaller figure , though still a disproportionate share . Just 11 percent will go to the middle one-fifth .\nREP. NANCY PELOSI , House Democratic leader : `` 86 million middle class families get a tax hike . '' \u2014 tweet Wednesday .\nTHE FACTS : She 's ignoring all the middle class tax cuts before 2027 ; that year , taxes will be slightly higher for the middle class unless the cuts are extended .\nPRES . TRUMP on his tax legislation : `` Obamacare has been repealed in this bill . '' \u2014 remarks Wednesday .\nTHE FACTS : It has n't . The tax plan ends fines for people who do n't carry health insurance . That 's a major change but far from the dismantling of the law .\nOther marquee components of Obama 's law remain , such as the Medicaid expansion serving low-income adults , protections that shield people with pre-existing medical conditions from being denied coverage or charged higher premiums , income-based subsidies for consumers buying individual health insurance policies , the requirement that insurers cover `` essential '' health benefits , and the mandate that larger employers provide coverage to their workers or face fines .\nAlso , the tax bill does n't repeal fines for uninsured individuals until the start of 2019 , meaning the `` individual mandate '' is still in force for next year unless the administration acts to waive the penalties .\nPRES . TRUMP : `` When the individual mandate is being repealed , that means Obamacare is being repealed because they get their money from the individual mandate . '' \u2014 remarks Wednesday .\nTHE FACTS : This is also wrong . The fines on people who do n't carry health insurance only provide a small fraction of the financing for the program . Most of the money comes from higher taxes on upper-income people , cuts in Medicare payments to service providers , and other tax increases .\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated that fines from uninsured people would total $ 3 billion this year , while the government 's cost for the coverage provided under the health law would total about $ 117 billion .\nPRES . TRUMP : `` So we 're at 3.3 percent GDP . I see no reason why we do n't go to 4 percent , 5 percent and even 6 percent . '' Speaks of GDP `` getting up to 4 , 5 , and even 6 percent , because I think that 's possible . '' \u2014 Cabinet meeting last week .\nTHE FACTS : There are no signs the economy is capable of delivering a phenomenal and rarely achieved growth rate in the order of 6 percent , or 5 or even 4 .
