The Villages is a retirement community in Florida , billed as the state \u2019 s \u201c Friendliest Hometown . \u201d\nYou would not want to cite that video in support of that contention .\n\u201c Thank you to the great people of The Villages , \u201d the president wrote . \u201c The Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats will Fall in the Fall . Corrupt Joe is shot . See you soon ! ! ! \u201d\nThe video was approximately two minutes long , and approximately ten seconds in , a pro-Trumper yelled , \u201c White power ! \u201d twice .\nThree hours after he circulated the video , the president deleted his tweet , with a spokesman saying , \u201c President Trump is a big fan of The Villages . He did not hear the one statement made on the video . What he did see was tremendous enthusiasm from his many supporters . \u201d\nThe \u201c white power \u201d guy got me to thinking about identity politics , as happens .\nObviously , not all expressions of identity politics are equal . When I was young , the slogan \u201c black power \u201d was in the air . Black Americans had been severely disadvantaged for a long time . They were sick of being powerless .\nThere was also the slogan \u201c Black is beautiful. \u201d You did not hear \u201c White is beautiful. \u201d There was no need for such a slogan . The denigration of black skin needed to be countered .\nI grew up in Ann Arbor , Mich. , a liberal citadel ( and , to a degree , a left-wing one ) . For my twelfth-grade year , I went to a boarding school elsewhere in the state , and heard a kid from a Detroit suburb say something jarring . He was a white kid , I should say . And he said , \u201c Black is beautiful , but white is right . \u201d\nWhat in the world ? How could a skin color be right or wrong ?\nLike you , certainly , I knew good white people and lousy white people . Good black people and lousy black people . One knew people .\nI belonged to a \u201c colorblind \u201d school of thought , or approach to life : a school that was soon to be attacked , mocked , and routed . It \u2019 s not that we were na\u00efve . No , not at all . It \u2019 s that we held a view of man that did not allow race as defining .\nYes , I actually use the word \u201c man. \u201d See what a dinosaur I am ?\nThe \u201c colorblind \u201d view was related to a political outlook : \u201c We hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal. \u201d And don \u2019 t forget the national motto : E pluribus unum .\nBut mainly , I think , our view was rooted in religion : a religious , or spiritual , estimate of man ( rising way , way above the physical ) .\nIn 1998 , Vice President Al Gore made a statement to the NAACP : \u201c I \u2019 ve heard the critics of affirmative action . They talk about a colorblind society . Give me a break ! Hel-lo ? They use their \u2018 colorblind \u2019 the way duck hunters use their duck blind : They hide behind it and hope the ducks won \u2019 t figure out what they \u2019 re up to . \u201d\nI burned at this statement , as I did at most things Gore . I thought it was grossly defamatory .\nIs man a tribal animal ? I find it increasingly hard to deny that this is so . \u201c What took you so long ! \u201d I can almost hear my old anthro profs say . ( Yes , I was an anthropology major . To see my 2015 piece \u201c Majoring in Anthro , \u201d go here . )\nThose who escape a tribal mentality are mainly able to do so through a religious or spiritual outlook , I think . Although it could be that secular humanism is enough . Of course , there \u2019 s plenty of religious tribalism ( or ecclesiastical tribalism , let \u2019 s say ) .\nIn any case , the \u201c default \u201d of man , I suspect , is tribal . It seems to be baked way in .\nSome individuals and some groups have tribalism forced on them , at least to a degree , by the tribalism of others . That must be acknowledged . If Smiths are constantly running down Joneses , people named \u201c Jones \u201d are going to feel like Joneses \u2014 are going to \u201c identify \u201d that way .\nSo , tribalism is a flagrant reality . But I hope people will not stop striving for one America . For the goal , or ideal , of E pluribus unum .\nAmerica aside , there is also the old concept of a \u201c family of man , \u201d which makes many eyes roll . I \u2019 m talking about a condition \u201c where there is neither Greek nor Jew , circumcision nor uncircumcision , Barbarian , Scythian , bond nor free . . . \u201d ( Told you about the eye rolling . )\nI find the identity politics of the Left and the identity politics of the Right distasteful , when not repulsive , but I don \u2019 t get a vote . Or rather , I get only one vote . And we see identity politics of many stripes on the rise .\nFurthermore , I think that identity politics begets identity politics .
