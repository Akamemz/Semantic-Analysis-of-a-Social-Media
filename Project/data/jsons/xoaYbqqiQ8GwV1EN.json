    "content": "The crunch was exacerbated by the disaster of the Iowa caucuses , which dominated headlines and deprived Warren and the other top three campaigns of bragging rights and a potential fundraising boost .\nThat was just one of several mistakes campaign officials are grappling with now as they contemplate how Warren \u2019 s once-surging campaign ended without placing above third in any of the first 18 contests . The campaign \u2019 s collapse has led to finger-pointing and self-doubt among Warren staffers and outside allies , who believe that even with the headwinds of sexism and electability she faced , the nomination was within reach .\n\u201c They chose ... Bailey over \u2018 blood and teeth , \u2019 \u201d said one staffer , referring to Warren \u2019 s golden retriever that the campaign made into an omnipresent prop to soften her image . \u201c Unforgivable . \u201d\n\u201c Blood and teeth \u201d refers to a famous Warren quote from the legislative fight over the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , which transformed Warren from a respected Harvard academic into a national progressive star . \u201c My first choice is a strong consumer agency , \u201d Warren said then . \u201c My second choice is no agency at all and plenty of blood and teeth left on the floor . \u201d\nThis account is based on interviews with more than two dozen people with intimate knowledge of Warren \u2019 s operation . They include some of her most senior aides , as well as junior staffers who implemented strategy and outside allies who worked closely with the campaign .\nFamously disciplined about not discussing internal campaign dynamics or strategy with reporters , they let loose after Warren \u2019 s withdrawal and described a series of botched strategic decisions and if-I-could-do-it-over-agains .\nBesides the misallocation of resources , many felt they had turned a candidate known for her tough-minded , blunt-spoken approach to politics into a more conventional politician . The portrayal of Warren primarily as a candidate of competence \u2014 \u201c Warren has a plan for that \u201d became a signature rallying cry \u2014 was not true to the candidate \u2019 s strongest selling points .\nMany also regret Warren playing too nice with her rivals until the very end , when it was too late .\nJoe Rospars , Warren \u2019 s chief strategist , said he and the campaign were trying to showcase the full Warren , not dull her edges .\n\u201c People watching closely got as complete a view of Elizabeth Warren as anyone who \u2019 s ever run for president , and she is more beloved because of it , \u201d he said in a statement . \u201c She is a tireless fighter with an uncommon humility and humanity , and it \u2019 s precisely that rare combination that would have made her a uniquely great president . \u201d\nNearly all the officials , who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to share their insights candidly , cited the double standard Warren faced on the campaign trail . When she went on the offensive , the backlash was usually more severe than it was for her male rivals , they said . And her bar for overcoming gaffes and misstatements , they believe , was much higher .\nSome have gloomily asserted that no woman could have solved the electability riddle in 2020 , with a Democratic electorate obsessed with defeating Donald Trump and traumatized by Hillary Clinton \u2019 s 2016 loss .\nBut most of the advisers and allies said that sexism doesn \u2019 t capture the entire story ; some argued it \u2019 s a distraction to paper over missteps . Warren was the Democratic frontrunner for weeks in the fall , they noted , and victory slipped through their grasp .\nSeveral people pointed to Rospars \u2019 overarching effort to make Warren less objectionable to voters . They argued there was excessive concern within the campaign that her hard-charging reputation would be too polarizing to the center of the party , and that only so many Bernie Sanders voters could be persuaded to switch to her .\nMany advisers acknowledged they were too wary of how female anger is perceived differently from male anger , and said Warren should have drawn contrasts with her rivals sooner and more often .\nFour veterans of Warren \u2019 s first run for Senate in 2012 said the 2020 campaign was sometimes unrecognizable .\n\u201c People really knew her as a fighter for the middle class . And people would shout at us [ at campaign events ] , \u2018 The middle class is getting hammered ! \u2019 So we knew they knew who she was , \u201d said Abby Clark , the deputy field director on the 2012 race who also volunteered for Warren in New Hampshire and Massachusetts this year . \u201c The language was accessible and people got it . The meaning of \u2018 big structural change \u2019 is mystifying to the average person .

Despite her very deliberate incorporation of race and the effects of racism into her policy proposals and speeches , Warren never earned significant support among minority voters , a fatal shortcoming that also did in several of her rivals .\n\u201c It just seemed we couldn \u2019 t talk to nonwhite folks , \u201d one Warren staffer said .\nEven after \u2588\u2588\u2588 reported the departure of several women of color from the Nevada team in the final stretch of the caucus , inside the campaign many advisers in the state complained the media sensationalized the story , rather than trying to address the culture that led to the women \u2019 s departures , according to two staffers on the ground in Nevada .\nWith her torrent of detailed policies , Warren established herself as the \u201c plans \u201d candidate by the spring .
