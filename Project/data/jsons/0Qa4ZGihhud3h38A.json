The previous week \u2019 s claims figure was revised down 2,000 to 5,506,500 .\nContinuing claims , those made after an initial week of benefits , rose to 15.98 million . Continuing claims , however , are reported with a one week lag . The total number of Americans who have lost their jobs since claims spiked five weeks ago because of coronavirus and shutdowns rose to around 26.4 million , enough to erase all the job gains since the economy began to recover after the financial crisis .\nThe 4-week moving average was 5,786,500 , an increase of 280,000 from the previous week \u2019 s revised average .\nThe CARES Act , passed to offset the economic impact of the coronavirus and stay-at-home orders , expanded the ranks of those eligible to file claims for unemployment benefits and raised the amount paid to unemployed workers .
