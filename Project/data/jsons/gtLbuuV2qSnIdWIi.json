    "content": "PALM BEACH , Fla.\u2014President Donald Trump called together several top advisers Saturday , including Attorney General Jeff Sessions and political strategist Steve Bannon , as the White House faced a growing furor over the president \u2019 s early morning claims he had been wiretapped by his predecessor .\nMr. Trump , who is spending the weekend at his private Mar-a-Lago club here , added a meeting with Mr . Sessions and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly to his calendar on Saturday , as political allies and foes of the president continued to react to the president \u2019 s claim on Twitter .\nMr. Trump tweeted early Saturday morning that former President Barack Obama had tapped his phones at Trump Tower , where Mr. Trump lived and worked in New York during the campaign , but provided no evidence for what amounted to an extraordinary claim of illegal activity by a former president .\nThe tweets used strong language and compared Mr. Obama to Joseph McCarthy and Richard Nixon . \u201c Terrible ! Just found out that Obama had my \u201c wires tapped \u201d in Trump Tower just before the victory , \u201d Mr. Trump tweeted at 6:35 a.m. \u201c Nothing found . This is McCarthyism ! \u201d\nHis postings also referred to Mr. Obama as a \u201c bad ( or sick ) guy , \u201d compared any such phone tapping to the Watergate scandal , and suggested that \u201c a good lawyer could make a great case \u201d of the matter .\nPublic officials , including some of Mr. Trump \u2019 s fellow Republicans , reacted sharply to the allegation . A spokesman for Mr. Obama said \u201c neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen . Any suggestion otherwise is simply false . \u201d\nThe White House didn \u2019 t provide clarification on what Mr. Trump may have been referring to or what evidence he had for his claims , though a recent article on the Breitbart website made similar allegations about the Obama administration . The furor threatened to overshadow a crucial upcoming week for Mr. Trump , in which he is scheduled to release a revised executive order on immigration and Republican-led congressional committees are set to begin producing health-care legislation .\nMr. Trump had been scheduled to dine Saturday evening with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross at Mar-a-Lago . In an update , the president \u2019 s staff said the two also would be joined by Messrs . Sessions , Bannon and Kelly , as well as policy adviser Stephen Miller and the White House counsel , Don McGahn , turning the dinner into a session of the president \u2019 s inner circle .\nThe meeting came as some prominent Republicans joined Democrats in calling on the president to explain his claims . Sen. Ben Sasse ( R. , Neb . ) , a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee , said in a written statement Saturday that Mr. Trump should \u201c explain what sort of wiretap it was and how he knows this . \u201d\nMr. Sasse said the president \u2019 s statement suggests he may have been illegally tapped , or the courts may have approved a legal wiretap out of national security concerns , which would raise its own set of questions . \u201c We are in the midst of a civilization-warping crisis of public trust , and the president \u2019 s allegations today demand the thorough and dispassionate attention of serious patriots , \u201d Mr. Sasse said .\nEarlier in the day , Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R. , S.C. ) , told an audience at Clemson University that Mr. Trump \u2019 s claim of having been illegally wiretapped , if true , would be \u201c the biggest scandal since Watergate. \u201d He added that he was also \u201c very worried if in fact the Obama administration was able to obtain a warrant lawfully about Trump campaign activity with foreign governments . \u201d\nRep. Justin Amash ( R. , Mich. ) , also called on Mr. Trump to share any evidence for his claim , saying on Twitter that the president \u201c should provide more info to Congress immediately to assess constitutionality and legality . \u201d\nMessrs. Sasse , Graham and Amash have been among the Republicans most willing to publicly criticize Mr. Trump in the past . Still , few if any Republicans defended his comments Saturday .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s assertion followed several days of negative news coverage , as attention focused on interactions between Mr. Trump \u2019 s campaign advisers , family , and political allies with representatives of the Russian government . Saturday \u2019 s tweets marked a return to the caustic tone that has often characterized the president \u2019 s remarks , a tone he departed from during a well-received speech to a joint session of Congress earlier in the week .\nUnder the law , presidents can \u2019 t legally order wiretaps . In a national security probe , investigators seeking a wiretap must convince a judge there is probable cause that a target for surveillance is an agent of foreign intelligence , and that the main purpose of the surveillance is to obtain foreign intelligence information . Investigators sometimes face a higher bar if the target is an American citizen .\nIn a criminal probe , investigators must show probable cause that a crime has been committed for electronic surveillance to be approved .\nThe conservative media outlet Breitbart , whose former chairman , Mr. Bannon , is Mr. Trump \u2019 s political strategist , published an article Friday based on the claims of a right-wing radio host that intelligence agencies were conducting a \u201c silent coup \u201d against Mr. Trump .\nThe host , Mark Levin , and the Breitbart article assert the Obama administration received authorization to conduct surveillance on the Trump campaign . Mr. Levin said that intelligence-gathering on the Trump campaign and its surrogates\u2014rather than the communications between Mr. Trump \u2019 s allies and Russian officials\u2014should be investigated by Congress .\nDemocrats reacted angrily to what they called baseless claims by Mr. Trump , including the president \u2019 s description of his predecessor as \u201c bad \u201d or \u201c sick . \u201d\n\u201c The President offered no evidence to support this spectacularly reckless allegation , \u201d said Rep.
