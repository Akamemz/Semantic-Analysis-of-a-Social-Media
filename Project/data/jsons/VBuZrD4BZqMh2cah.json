Drake and others who are challenging a recent appeals court ruling .\nA three-judge panel of the 3rd U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals last summer ruled against Drake 's challenge to a provision in New Jersey law that says people seeking permits to carry a concealed firearm must prove to police that they have a justifiable need .\nThe brief from Wyoming Attorney General 's Office says that Wyoming and the other states are concerned that if the appeals court ruling stands , it could threaten their less-restrictive concealed carry laws .\n`` This decision out of New Jersey impacts the right to keep and bear arms outside of the home , '' Wyoming Gov . Matt Mead said Wednesday . `` So , I felt it was necessary to have the attorney general support a petition to the Supreme Court to hear this case .\n`` If the current decision stands , states providing greater protections than New Jersey under the Second Amendment may be pre-empted by future federal action , '' said Mead , a Republican .\nWyoming is among the most pro-gun states in the nation . Although Wyoming still issues concealed carry permits to its citizens , the state in 2011 changed its laws to allow concealed carry without a permit .\nMead and other statewide officials this month approved $ 13 million in grants to help a Colorado producer of ammunition magazines for guns move its manufacturing operations to Wyoming . Magpul Industries of Erie , Colo. , pledged to move out of Colorado after lawmakers in that state enacted gun control measures last year .\nThe Star-Ledger , a New Jersey newspaper , reported Wednesday that Drake , of Fredon , N.J. , is a business owner who owns and services ATMs . He told the paper he sometimes carries large amounts of cash .\n`` It seems unreasonable to me to have to wait until you 're beaten up or shot at to get a permit , '' Drake said told the newspaper .\nThe National Rifle Association also is supporting Drake 's legal challenge .\nThe Star-Ledger quoted Chris W.
