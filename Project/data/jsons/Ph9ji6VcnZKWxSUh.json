It \u2019 s not just court cases and laws that shape these views , but also a larger backdrop of the nation \u2019 s attempt to come to grips with a long history of race and inequality .\nAffirmative action is a major hot button in that context , but on a practical level , it \u2019 s not a focal point for a large swath of American colleges .\n\u201c The number of universities that use race in admissions has always been a small fraction of the higher education landscape , but it is dwindling over the past 20 years , \u201d says Matthew Johnson , an assistant professor of history at Texas Tech University .\nJudge Allison Burroughs ruled strongly in favor of Harvard , but she did not espouse a view that race-conscious admissions policies will be justifiable forever , nor did she let the college off the hook for imperfections in its admissions system . She recommended implicit bias training and continued monitoring of admissions data .\nQuoting from the Supreme Court in its 2016 Fisher II decision on behalf of the University of Texas , Austin , she wrote that the university must \u201c scrutinize the fairness of its admissions program ... and engage in constant deliberation and continued reflection regarding its admissions policies . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s not just universities , but parents and students themselves who should be engaging in more reflection , suggests Ethan , an Asian American freshman at Harvard who asked that his last name not be used . \u201c The most important thing regarding this discussion is that where you go is not going to decide how successful you \u2019 re going to be , \u201d he says , noting a cultural tendency within the Asian American community to focus perhaps too heavily on the elite institutions . \u201c The university is a part of your identity , but if it \u2019 s such a determining factor of identity , I think that \u2019 s not a healthy mindset , \u201d he says .\nSitting outside the Harvard Science Center on Wednesday morning , Ethan adds that if the case does go to the Supreme Court , \u201c Harvard needs to argue convincingly that , yes , diversity is something that is really key to our university and our environment. \u201d But he also understands the frustrations of Asian American prospective college students , he says , recognizing that he \u2019 s speaking from a position of privilege being at the university .\nWith the pressure still on , many selective colleges and universities have been steering themselves toward \u201c race neutral \u201d policies to dodge the volleys of affirmative action opponents , even before any potential ban from the Supreme Court materializes . Now , though , even race-neutral strategies \u2013 such as relying more on socioeconomic factors to diversify an incoming class \u2013 are also becoming targets of scrutiny , if not outright attack .\nParticularly in states with laws against affirmative action in admissions , universities often create race-neutral systems to diversify their student bodies . The courts so far haven \u2019 t precisely defined what counts as race neutral , Professor Johnson says , so currently \u201c there are lots of ways you can kind of capture race without really capturing race on the surface . \u201d\nIn California , where voters opted to ban race-conscious admissions in 1996 via Proposition 209 , a lawsuit is under way with the ultimate goal of making sure the University of California isn \u2019 t \u201c cheating \u201d by surreptitiously \u201c using race consciously to bring about racial outcomes , \u201d says Richard Sander , a UCLA economist and law professor , whose data methodologies and arguments criticizing affirmative action have long been controversial .\nLast November , he joined forces with the Asian American Community Services Center in filing the public records lawsuit against the University of California regents .\nProfessor Sander \u2019 s contested \u201c mismatch \u201d theory argues that when race is no longer used in admissions , a higher caliber of students among underrepresented minorities are attracted to apply , and when they don \u2019 t feel stigmatized , they remain and graduate at higher rates .\nHe studied Prop 209 with previous data , and wants to update his research because in 2007 , UCLA shifted away from a demonstrably race-neutral admissions approach to a \u201c holistic \u201d process , which he and other critics claim is less transparent and has reintroduced race into the calculation .\nIf this leads to a discrimination lawsuit against the UC system , it could launch a sort of Stage II of the anti-affirmative action mission . That \u2019 s because even if the Supreme Court eventually bans the use of race in admissions , \u201c some court has to come up with how you ensure universities are obeying the law , \u201d Professor Sander says .\nSpokeswoman Claire Doan said in an email that responding to Professor Sander \u2019 s records request \u201c would impose an extensive burden on University resources and is not required by state law , \u201d and noted UC \u2019 s commitment to \u201c fairness and transparency \u201d in admissions .\nBut advocates for racial equity are concerned . For California to lose the race-neutral approach to promoting diversity would mean \u201c a decline again in underrepresented minority students in the UC system , \u201d Professor Johnson says .\nMany universities and even corporations would be likely to come together to defend race-conscious admissions if the issue winds up back on the Supreme Court docket , says Professor Johnson from Texas Tech .\nSuch supporters would have plenty to draw from in Judge Burroughs \u2019 ruling in the SFFA v.

It is this , at Harvard and elsewhere that will move us , one day , to the point where we see that race is a fact , but not the defining fact and not the fact that tells us what is important , but we are not there yet. \u201d Until then , she noted , policies like Harvard \u2019 s , which use race in a narrowly tailored way , \u201c will have an important place in society ... \u201d\nThe University of Texas , whose use of race in admissions was approved by the Supreme Court in 2016 , is still having to defend its policies against Mr. Blum .
