Could term limitation laws actually make our poor underpaid and overworked politicians vacate their powerful perches . . . even when they don \u2019 t want to ?\nWho could have foreseen this strange turn of events ? Who could have predicted that limits on the number of terms politicians may stay in office would mandate that politicians , having reached that limit , would be summarily cast out to live like the rest of us ?\nYou guessed . Everyone . The \u201c mass turnover \u201d coming after the 2018 election cycle will indeed be caused by term limits . Booted out will be 26 of 38 state senators and 24 of 110 reps in the House .\nWhile this level of turnover is certainly unheard of in the U.S. Congress and the 35 states lacking term limits , it is not so out of the ordinary for Michigan . For instance , the Great Lakes State saw greater turnover in 2010 with 25 senators and 34 representatives termed-out .\nIn fact , one clear result of the state \u2019 s toughest-in-the-nation term limits law is the state \u2019 s best-in-the-nation level of electoral competitiveness . In both the 2014 and 2016 election cycles , Michigan led the nation with every single state legislative seat contested . Michigan \u2019 s 100 percent competitiveness in the last two cycles compares to a national average of just 58 percent in 2016 and 57 percent in 2014 .\nIs it possible that voters are much fonder of competitive elections than are incumbent politicians and powerful lobbyists ? Perhaps that is why the \u201c renewed interest in reform \u201d comes not from the state \u2019 s citizens , but their politicians .\nThe newspaper report continues : \u201c Term limits remain popular with the voting public , but critics say Michigan rules have thrust inexperienced legislators into complex policy issues they may be ill-equipped to address . \u201d\nRich Studley , the Michigan Chamber of Commerce \u2019 s head-honcho , argues that \u201c Leadership really matters , and experience really matters. \u201d His lobbying outfit , \u201c an influential business group with significant financial resources , \u201d is working to organize support for a ballot measure to weaken the limits it has so vehemently opposed for the last 25 years .\nWhy such fierce opposition ? Because term limits supposedly give too much power and influence to . . . ( drum roll ) . . . lobbyists and special interests .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t want [ the legislature ] to be strictly a place , \u201d counters Scott Tillman , national field director of U.S . Term Limits , \u201c where a bunch of people with an incumbent advantage have a lock on the system and are the only ones who can get elected and make decisions for the state . \u201d\n\u201c The basic message citizens have given their government for 200 years now has been to have a Legislature full of people who represent citizens , \u201d contends Patrick Anderson , the author of the 1992 term limits measure . \u201c To do that effectively , you want to make sure that those legislators are periodically drawn from the citizenry , and term limits ensures that . \u201d\nTaking the opposite point of view is Wayne State University Political Science Professor Marjorie Sarbaugh-Thompson . The author of two books on term limits , she dubs Michigan \u201c the Draconian term limits state , \u201d and claims legislators are ineffective because they have \u201c one eye on that clock all the time instead of thinking , \u2018 I need to really fix this problem because it \u2019 s going to come back to haunt me . \u2019 \u201d\nYet , Sarbaugh-Thompson offers no analysis as to why legislators in the non-term-limited states \u2014 or the career-dominated Congress in D.C. \u2014 are much more hauntingly ineffective .\n\u201c Her research suggests Michigan \u2019 s term limits have failed to deliver on many of the \u2018 good government \u2019 promises that appeal to citizens , \u201d according to the News . What the News neglects to tell readers is that Sarbaugh-Thompson \u2019 s \u201c research relies heavily on face-to-face interviews with Michigan \u2019 s state House members conducted in 1998 , 2000 , 2002 and 2004 and State Senators in 2000 , 2006 , and 2010 . \u201d\nWhy am I not surprised that \u201c research \u201d centered on the views of incumbent officeholders is not very favorable to limits on incumbent officeholders ?\nTwo things we know for certain : politicians hate term limits ; voters love them .\nThat \u2019 s why the News explains , \u201c Any reform plan is unlikely to extend or repeal term limits , but may instead allow legislators to serve longer in the House or Senate . \u201d\nCome again ?
