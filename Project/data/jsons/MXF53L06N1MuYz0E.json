    "content": "Inevitably , he arrives late , by SUV or van . The former vice-president is thin and , yes , he \u2019 s old . He dresses neatly and always in blue . Staff envelop him . There \u2019 s the body man , the advance man , the videographer , the photographer , the digital director , the traveling chief of staff , the traveling press secretary , the local press secretary , the adviser , the other adviser , the adviser \u2019 s adviser , the surrogate , the other surrogate , and the bodyguard .\nThe looming presence of the last guy , Jim , is especially important for optics . Jim is tall and official-looking . He greets the world chest-first , his hands resting in a dignified clasp , his expression even , his mouth unmoving . Most people assume that he \u2019 s a Secret Service agent . Which he was .\nBut ex-VPs don \u2019 t get security for life the way ex-presidents do . Most people don \u2019 t know that , not even the politically savvy types who attend these sorts of things . And that \u2019 s all for the best , because Jim \u2014 or whatever local guy they \u2019 ve got filling in for him in Iowa or New Hampshire or Nevada or wherever else \u2014 is a necessary component of the vibe they \u2019 re trying to generate here , the Big Presidential Energy , if you will , that powers this production .\nAnd it is a production . This is true even when the event is small , which it often is , because the stakes never are \u2014 Joe Biden speaking off the cuff is something the entire campaign seems focused on preventing at all costs . Inside the community center or union hall or college auditorium , the stage is crafted just so . The red and blue letters \u2014 each roughly the size of a 9-year-old \u2014 spell IOWA 4 BIDEN . The American flag is stretched taut and stapled to the plywood . The lawn sign is stapled to the lectern . The delicate panes of teleprompter glass angle to meet his hopeful gaze , so that he may absorb the programmed speech as he peers out at his audience , which usually skews quite old and white , unless he \u2019 s in South Carolina .\nThis first part \u2014 the reading of the speech \u2014 he almost always gets right . Even when he makes changes , rearranging the order of the words , skipping over a few , adding others , how could he not get it right ? He \u2019 s been delivering some version of it for more than 40 years and living it for longer . He could deliver it in his sleep , if he ever sleeps . It \u2019 s like my father always said : Joey , a job is about more than just a paycheck . It \u2019 s about your dignity . It \u2019 s about being able to look your child in the eye and say , \u201c It \u2019 s gon na be okay \u2026 \u201d There is an undercurrent of shame that pulses throughout , this idea that the unequalness of our society is embarrassing for those who have access to less , rather than embarrassing for those who have more than anyone could need .\nFolks \u2026 Not a joke ! He \u2019 s always saying something rather solemn , about cancer or immigration , and then adding , \u201c Not a joke ! \u201d as if anyone thought it might be . I \u2019 m being serious here \u2026 Come on \u2026 The bottom line is \u2026 I \u2019 m not kidding around \u2026 The fact of the matter is \u2026 Barack and me \u2026 Folks \u2026 Folks \u2026 Folks \u2026 folks \u2026 folks \u2026 folks \u2026 folks \u2026 folks \u2026 folks \u2026 folks \u2026 FOLKS \u2026 folks \u2026 FoLkS \u2026 fOlKs \u2026 F. O. L. K. S. \u2026\nAnd this next part \u2014 the greeting of the voters \u2014 he gets right , too . In this context , he possesses an almost mystical quality that , for whatever reason , does not come across when filtered through the kaleidoscope of newsprint or television . It \u2019 s the way he focuses his eyes , which are as blue as the seas , except for ( yikes ) that time the left eye filled with blood on CNN a few weeks back .\nHe is swarmed . Women reach out to him , linking their arms in his . He bows his head and lifts their hands to his mouth for a kiss and , later , when you ask them if that makes them uncomfortable , they look at you like you have three heads . This is the best day of their lives . Are you insane ? There are men , too , who embrace him , wrapping their hands around his neck . He calls every male-presenting human he encounters \u201c man. \u201d I watched him call a baby \u201c man. \u201d As in , Hey ! How\u00adareya , man ? ! He is as skilled a selfie-taker as any influencer , and in the span of 30 or 40 minutes , he snaps hundreds , leaning his body against the rope that separates him from the crowd , straining it one , two , three feet forward . He really does connect with every living being this way , talking about their jobs or their health care as he listens , sometimes crying with them , whispering in their ears , taking their phone numbers and promising to call them . He does , in fact , do that . Everybody is Joe Biden \u2019 s long-lost friend . Every baby is Joe Biden \u2019 s long-lost child . A little girl in Iowa City called him her uncle Joe . On the Fourth of July in the town of Independence , he took off , running through the parade like a dingo with somebody \u2019 s newborn . As hard as it might be to believe that anything in this realm could not be bullshit , it \u2019 s simply true that this isn \u2019 t .\nHis own loss is staggering in its scale and cruelty : Neilia , his wife , and Naomi , his infant daughter , killed in a car crash . Beau , his oldest son , who survived that crash with his brother , Hunter , killed decades later by brain cancer . And it \u2019 s as though in that loss he \u2019 s gained access to an otherwise imperceptible wavelength on which he communicates in this way , with the eyes and the hands .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t know how to describe it , but sometimes some people would walk up with a lot of emotion in their face , and without even hearing their story , he could connect with them , \u201d John Flynn , who served as Biden \u2019 s senior adviser in the White House , said . \u201c He would know it was either one thing or another , and he would just know how to approach them and to get them to gently open up if they wanted to . And if they didn \u2019 t want to , he just said , \u2018 Hey , I \u2019 m with you , and I \u2019 m there for you . I feel your pain . \u2019 \u201d\nChris Coons was an intern for Biden in the Senate and is now a United States senator from Delaware himself . He told me about Loretta Wootten , a former colleague who in January went into a coma after a car crash that killed her husband . \u201c I went to visit Loretta when she regained consciousness , and she looks at me , and she says , \u2018 Does Joe know I \u2019 m here ? \u2019 That \u2019 s her first sentence . I said , \u2018 I don \u2019 t know . I mean , he \u2019 s running for president. \u2019 And , she says , \u2018 I just would love to hear from him. \u2019 The next time I see him , I say , \u2018 Do you remember Loretta Wootten ? \u2019 and he smiles and he says , \u2018 Of course. \u2019 I said , \u2018 Well , Loretta \u2019 s husband was just killed in a car accident , and she \u2019 s in recovery. \u2019 And he gets this look , and he turned to someone and said , \u2018 Get me a piece of paper. \u2019 And he writes out this page-long , heartfelt message to her , hands it to me , and says , \u2018 Please get this to her. \u2019 When I delivered that to her , she wept with joy . \u201d\nI have witnessed this kind of connection at nearly all of the countless events I \u2019 ve attended in a half-dozen states in the six months since Biden announced his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination . If he ever does sleep , surely Joe Biden dreams as he proselytizes , of an unbroken America , its ideals and reputation restored , where everybody is folks and folks have everything they need and maybe some of what they want , where the field is just even enough that nobody is ashamed of their own place on it , and where the president isn \u2019 t an idiot but where you can easily deal with the idiots by kicking the shit out of them out back in a parking lot or something . Crucially , in this dream , Joe Biden is the president .\nThe pitch goes like this : Joe Biden ought to be the nominee because he \u2019 s electable , a meaningless concept if recent history is any guide , and presidential , that wonderful word \u2014 the thing Donald Trump could never be even though he literally is president \u2014 despite the fact that Biden , who appears by almost any measure to be a good man , a man whose lone sin in life is ego ( and does that even count anymore ? ) , has spent a half-century grasping for this position and watching it slip through his fingers .\nTo anyone paying attention \u2014 the army of political professionals more wired to observe shortcomings than are those likely to actually vote for him or for anyone else \u2014 it looks , unmistakably , like it \u2019 s happening again . His vulnerabilities are close to the surface . There \u2019 s the basic fact of his oldness and the concerns , explicit or implicit , about his ability to stay agile and alive for four more years . This was true of Biden , who is 76 , even more than it was true of Bernie Sanders , who is the oldest candidate at 78 , up until Sanders had a heart attack while campaigning in Nevada earlier this month . ( It \u2019 s not true at all of Elizabeth Warren , who is 70 but seems a decade younger . And it \u2019 s not exactly true of Trump , who is 73 and really just seems crazy , not old . )\nBut it \u2019 s not just his age itself . It \u2019 s his tendency to misspeak , his inartful debating style , and \u2014 most of all \u2014 his status as a creature from another time in the Democratic Party , when the politics of race and crime and gender were unrecognizably different . It \u2019 s not just that the Joe Biden of yesteryear sometimes peeks out from behind the No . 1 Obama Stan costume . It \u2019 s that the Joe Biden of today is expected to hold his former self accountable to the new standards set by a culture that \u2019 s prepared to reject him . And though he \u2019 s the party Establishment \u2019 s obvious exemplar , he can \u2019 t seem to raise any money \u2014 spending more in the last quarter than he brought in and moving into the homestretch with less than $ 9 million in the bank ( roughly a third of what Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders has on hand ) . For political reporters , marveling every day at just how well this isn \u2019 t going , watching Biden can feel like being at the rodeo . You \u2019 re there because on some level you know you might see someone get killed .\nYet Biden is still the front-runner . Volatile and potentially worthless as they may be , it \u2019 s what the polls say . Biden leads the field on average by a handful of percentage points , though his lead has trended steadily downward , from a high of 33 in May to 20 in June to 11 , and then to 9.9 , and 6.6 , and 5.4 , according to RealClearPolitics . In the whole campaign , there has only been one day \u2014 October 8 \u2014 when he slipped to second place , an average of 0.2 points behind Warren . He \u2019 s also the front-runner in South Carolina , Nevada , California , Texas , North Carolina , and Florida . \u201c There is this sense of hanging on . And perhaps he can . But that \u2019 s generally not the way the physics of these things work , \u201d former Obama adviser David Axelrod told me . \u201c Generally , you \u2019 re either moving up or moving down . Warren is clearly moving up . There \u2019 s no sign that he is . \u201d\nBiden is aware that it \u2019 s not going well . But it \u2019 s not apparent that he knows how to fix it . Recently , according to his staff , his anxieties have manifested more visibly . If he begins to question something small , he spirals , eventually questioning everything . Should he be saying this in his speech ? Wait , should he be giving this speech at all ? Should he even be focusing on this group ? Is this even the right position ? He freaks out over minor stuff on the trail that staffers don \u2019 t believe he should be concerning himself with and yet is unable to make strategic adjustments . But the staff concern themselves with unimportant matters , too , running what they think is a general-election campaign when they need to be running a primary . Inside the campaign , the Biden brain trust seems to exist more to comfort the candidate than to compel him , and strategy meetings inevitably devolve into meandering , ruminative roundtables that feel purposeless except to fill time in the day . Nobody will tell the candidate in plain terms what they think he needs to change . Not that Biden really listens anyway .\nSome on the campaign still believe he can win , in part because they believe he should win . But even to them , the path to a collapse seems clear : Biden loses in Iowa and New Hampshire , where his leads have been steadily declining for months and where , recently , Elizabeth Warren has overtaken him , and then , as a result , loses his sheer aura of electability , too . But inside the campaign , they reportedly see another path , though it might not seem , at first , an optimistic one : Okay , so he loses Iowa and then New Hampshire , but so what ? Because he is who he is and represents what he represents \u2014 the embodiment of both the white-working-class model of the electorate and the glow of the Obama years \u2014 he can weather the losses and march to victory through Super Tuesday and beyond . \u201c Their theory is a long , twilight struggle where they accumulate delegates everywhere as minority voters start playing a larger role , \u201d Axelrod said . \u201c But in reality , it \u2019 s tough to be a winner when you keep losing or at least appear to be . \u201d\nBiden would obviously like you to think about his age as experience , but another way of thinking about experience is as a record . He \u2019 s got a long one . When he was elected to the Senate , Pete Buttigieg was still a decade away from birth . There \u2019 s a lot of material , then , for Biden \u2019 s critics to work with . All sorts of stuff that doesn \u2019 t age well , or doesn \u2019 t quite compute , in this season of absolutism : Anita Hill and allegations that he violated the personal space of several women , controversy over his crusade against busing as a desegregation measure and his eagerness to work with segregationist lawmakers . Last week , after Biden attacked Trump for calling his impeachment a \u201c lynching , \u201d video emerged of Biden calling Bill Clinton \u2019 s impeachment the same thing . If it was relevant to American political life at any point since Richard Nixon was president , Biden probably said something about it , but it \u2019 s new to many younger voters and activists and talking heads now .\nMany of them treat Biden \u2019 s talking as yet another symptom of his age , but Biden has always been like this . \u201c His major defect is that he goes on and on and on , \u201d Orrin Hatch told the Washington Post in 1986 , when Biden was 43 . To say he overcame his childhood stutter would be a bad joke , like one of those I BEAT ANOREXIA T-shirts they sell on the Jersey boardwalk in size XXXL .\nIn Des Moines , in August , he told a crowd , \u201c Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids. \u201d Realizing what he \u2019 d done , he tried to correct himself . \u201c Wealthy kids , \u201d he said , \u201c black kids , Asian kids . No , I really mean it , but think how we think about it. \u201d Two weeks later , in Keene , New Hampshire , he said , \u201c I love this place . Look , what \u2019 s not to like about Vermont in terms of the beauty of it ? And what a neat town . This is sort of a scenic , beautiful town. \u201d ( When he returned to New Hampshire the following month , a protester held a sign that read WELCOME TO VERMONT , JOE . ) And so on .\nBiden is cocooned by family , longtime advisers , and former White House staff . His wife Jill , Val , Mike Donilon , Ted Kaufman , Bruce Reed , Annie Tomasini , Tony Blinken , Steve Ricchetti , Ron Klain . But beyond that small circle , veterans are harder to find on his campaign . Biden is chronically slow to make decisions , and his late entry into the race , which came months after many of his competitors , was an additional challenge to staffing the campaign . Many working at Biden headquarters in Philadelphia have no experience on a presidential campaign , and some have never worked on any campaign at all ; even those closest to the candidate address him , deferentially , as \u201c sir . \u201d\n\u201c Some of these folks who have never worked on a presidential before are like , \u2018 Okay , I \u2019 m working for the former vice-president ! \u2019 They don \u2019 t really feel like it \u2019 s slipping , \u201d one senior campaign adviser told me . \u201c There \u2019 s such reverence for getting to work for the vice-president that I think , for some of those folks , there \u2019 s a mentality of How could we possibly lose ? He \u2019 s who he is . I don \u2019 t think they see that that \u2019 s not all it \u2019 s gon na take. \u201d ( Yes , even Biden \u2019 s staff say \u201c folks \u201d the way others say \u201c like \u201d or \u201c um . \u201d )\nFor many of these staffers , the campaign feels like it should be a coronation . Joe Biden 2020 isn \u2019 t a labor of love or ideology . It \u2019 s about the proper order of things . It \u2019 s about who \u2019 s entitled to what . It \u2019 s the vehicle by which the Democratic Party Establishment arrives once more to power , the displaced Obama and Clinton professionals reinstalled at the levers . If the Republic is spared in the process \u2014 which everybody genuinely wants , sure ! \u2014 that \u2019 s a plus . And it \u2019 s great branding . When it comes to the enthusiasm voters wear on their sleeves for Warren or Sanders , the Biden campaign strikes a cool , dismissive pose , as if it could be believed that a candidate for president weren \u2019 t preoccupied with such metrics .\nThe activist wing of the party is a lost cause to Biden just as he \u2019 s a lost cause to them . When they show up at his speeches to confront him or protest in support of the Green New Deal , something I \u2019 ve witnessed twice in New Hampshire , he attempts to formulate what he surely believes is a respectful response , and yet they don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s enough , because nothing that he says could be enough because of who he is . Can you blame anyone under the age of 30 for their cynicism , for their hostility ?\n\u201c Internally , there was always this idea that there would be some point when he wasn \u2019 t No . 1 , \u201d one senior campaign adviser swears . \u201c To some extent , people were prepped for that . There isn \u2019 t a culture inside the campaign right now like , This is a done deal and we \u2019 ve lost . The culture is , This is getting real . People are still reacting to that . The question is : Does this now change our strategy and our culture ? That \u2019 s where we are right now , figuring out what this new stature means . \u201d\nWhere they are , if you \u2019 re keeping track , is slumped . And it \u2019 s a strange dynamic \u2014 the most qualified candidate in the race , surrounded by entitled staff who don \u2019 t understand that they have to fight for the nomination , or even the presidency , but without a real case to make beyond a Democratic succession that would amount to an Obama restoration . \u201c He has no center , \u201d as one person close to the Biden family put it . \u201c He \u2019 s literally only a politician . That \u2019 s who he is . That \u2019 s all he is . Biden is fundamentally a toadie . He \u2019 s just political . He needs to kiss ass ? He \u2019 ll kiss ass . \u201d\n\u201c They have him in the candidate-protection program , \u201d Axelrod says . \u201c I don \u2019 t know if you can do that . I don \u2019 t know if you can get through a whole campaign that way . Either he can hack it or he can \u2019 t hack it . If you \u2019 re worried the candidate can hurt himself talking to a reporter , that \u2019 s a bad sign. \u201d ( Biden declined to be interviewed for this story . )\nFor his part , Biden is consumed with his endorsements , another sign of his perhaps outdated political instincts ; getting insiders to declare their support meant something when powerful political machines controlled the primary process , but it has much less relevance to presidential politics today . And the only endorsement that could matter hasn \u2019 t materialized . President Barack Obama has remained silent on the 2020 primary even as he saw it fit to involve himself in Canadian affairs , endorsing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau . A senior White House official , reflecting on Biden \u2019 s weakness , told me Biden should have never even entered the race without knowing he \u2019 d have the former president \u2019 s support .\nOf course , that was always less of a sure thing than it might have seemed . In 2016 , Obama went all-in for Hillary , even as his vice-president contemplated a run . In the early stages of this race , he didn \u2019 t just avoid aligning himself with Biden but gestured toward other candidates , including unlikely contender Deval Patrick , the former governor of Massachusetts , possibly to discourage his former veep from running .\nAnd then there \u2019 s Hunter Biden himself , who was going to become an issue one way or another . The 49-year-old son of privilege and tragedy , he has had struggles with addiction and run-ins with the law that have been well-documented . The campaign did its best to control the subject , cooperating with a tell-all interview over the summer in which Hunter candidly discussed his drug use and his relationship with his brother \u2019 s widow . This is sometimes how flacks think they \u2019 ll get ahead of a story : You neuter the shock value by delivering the shock yourself . But when your son is a central character in an impeachment saga likely to preoccupy all of Washington and political news for six months , it \u2019 s a hard thing to get ahead of , especially when you don \u2019 t really seem to want to engage .\n\u201c It \u2019 s sort of bewildering , \u201d Axelrod says . \u201c I guess I understand it from a familial , psychological sense . It would just be so much better if he stated the obvious : Even Hunter has said he exercised poor judgment . He won \u2019 t even say what his kid said . It \u2019 s an obvious question as to why the rules that he \u2019 s going to apply in the future didn \u2019 t apply in the past . All this was foreseeable \u2026 You can \u2019 t say , \u2018 He did nothing wrong , \u2019 and , \u2018 He \u2019 ll never do it again. \u2019 Those things don \u2019 t go together . Biden can be stubborn . I think his stubbornness is showing here. \u201d All of that said , Axelrod added , \u201c what Trump is doing is loathsome and outrageous because there \u2019 s no evidence that Biden did anything wrong or that Hunter did anything wrong . \u201d\nIn a certain sense , impeachment creates for Biden what he wanted all along : a direct competition with Trump . Looked at it one way , it \u2019 s a story about how the president of the United States was so worried about his formidable opponent that he risked his entire presidency , and even broke the law , to try to stop him . But in other ways , it \u2019 s exactly what Biden hoped to avoid : a focus on his most troubled child , the last remaining member of his first family , and the privilege his political and celebrity status affords . Even if he didn \u2019 t do anything \u201c wrong , \u201d Trump is right that there \u2019 s a swamp , though he doesn \u2019 t realize he \u2019 s its ugliest creature , and impeachment is a daily reminder that Biden swims there , too . Who could withstand an entire year of character assassination by the president , who is aided by a political media that projects his every statement to the world ?\nAt the Iowa State Fair in August , as candidates took to the stage to deliver their stump speeches and answer questions from the Des Moines Register , I stood off to the side with a few members of the press . We craned our necks downward to squint at a zoomed-in photo of the side of Joe Biden \u2019 s head . There , just behind the ear , is where you can supposedly observe the scar from a face-lift , one of many cosmetic procedures Biden is rumored to have had .\nThe dramatic change to Biden \u2019 s appearance is a matter of preoccupation for Biden-watchers . In the timeline of images from throughout his career , you can observe as he grows older and then younger and then older but somehow more elegant and alert . His hair is white now but thicker than it was in the 1980s . He \u2019 s thinner , but his cheeks are fuller than they were in 2008 . To be honest with you , he looks good . He \u2019 s almost 77 !\nThis is also a minor obsession of the White House , as you can probably imagine . Privately , Trump has marveled at the \u201c work \u201d Biden has had done and the fact that , in his opinion , he doesn \u2019 t look any better for it . Those who know him say the president is against plastic surgery ( by which I assume they don \u2019 t mean breast implants ) and , especially , bad plastic surgery , and he considers it an all-too-common tragedy when someone has their face inexpertly altered .\nA senior White House official who regularly discusses the campaign with Trump was describing how his view of Biden has evolved since the winter . It was then , before Biden declared , that the campaign began conducting polling and sharing the results with Trump himself . The internal numbers were as bad as the external . Biden destroyed Trump . The president \u2019 s anxieties only grew as Biden became a more popular topic on cable news . \u201c It was easy to get caught up , \u201d this official said . \u201c The president saw that it \u2019 s easier to picture Joe Biden up on the debate stage than some of the others . \u201d\nOver time , as Biden formally waded into the race , and the president saw the reality of the candidate as opposed to the idea of Vice-President Joe Biden , he grew less concerned , according to the senior White House official . Biden was no longer \u201c the guy he was worried about. \u201d And one of the reasons was , in Trumpian fashion , \u201c his look. \u201d Though the official adds a few more items to the list as well : \u201c His cadence . His inability to speak . His small crowds . \u201d\nTrump has also commented on Biden \u2019 s wardrobe choices , wondering why he \u2019 d wear Ralph Lauren polo shirts on the campaign trail that show off his graying chest hair and skinny arms . ( Trump himself wears polo shirts almost exclusively while golfing ) .\nInside the White House and the reelection campaign , the true believers know how to decode Trump \u2019 s bitchy nicknames for his competitors . As iconic as \u201c Crooked Hillary \u201d and \u201c Lyin \u2019 Ted \u201d may be , his crowning achievement remains \u201c Low Energy , \u201d his characterization of Jeb Bush . \u201c Sleepy Joe \u201d is considered Trump \u2019 s attempt at a 2020 remake of \u201c Low Energy , \u201d and it \u2019 s all about emphasizing Biden \u2019 s age .\nIn September , somebody had the bright idea to stage an afternoon event under the open sky at the Indian Creek Nature Center in sunny Cedar Rapids . It was the day after news of the whistle-blower broke , but Biden stuck to the event \u2019 s topic , climate change , addressing all the usual themes . Then faces began turning upward to the birds overhead . Somebody from Showtime \u2019 s The Circus told me the birds were bald eagles , but at the time I thought they looked like hawks , which , I guess , is a sort of glass-half-empty or -half-full dilemma . Eventually , word of the alleged bald eagles made its way to Biden , and with a look of optimism , he turned his face to the sky . He grew emotional . He said that at the Lake House , Beau used to sit by the water and watch the bald eagles fly overhead . The night Beau died , in 2015 , Biden said he watched an eagle take off from the lake , circle in the sky , and then fly away . He hadn \u2019 t seen another bald eagle since that night , he said , until now . Looking at the bird , he said , \u201c Maybe that \u2019 s my Beau . \u201d\nBiden wrote a book about his grief , and about his son , called Promise Me , Dad . Therein , he tells a similar story , but with a different bird . That night , he wrote , \u201c Jill spotted a white egret at the far edge of the water. \u201d She told her husband that , as he lay dying , she whispered to Beau to go to the dock , \u201c his happy place , \u201d with his brother . \u201c We watched the egret for twenty minutes , until it finally took flight , \u201d Biden wrote . \u201c The two of us sat in silence as the egret circled overhead repeatedly , slowly gaining altitude , until it finally headed away to the south , beneath the clouds , and gradually disappeared from sight . \u2018 It \u2019 s a sign from God , \u2019 Jill said . \u2018 Beau being at the lake one last time , and heading for heaven . \u2019 \u201d\nAnne Kearns is an 84-year-old grandmother of 16 and retired professor . For 58 years , she has lived in the modest blue house with black shutters on North Washington Avenue in Scranton , Pennsylvania , where Joe Biden lived during the first decade of his life .\n\u201c He calls this \u2018 the Homestead , \u2019 \u201d she told me last Sunday . We were sitting in the living room , surrounded by framed photos of her large family and one photo of Biden , propped up on the TV stand . For most of his career , Biden was among the least-wealthy members of Congress , an attractive bullet point that he continues to note even after amassing a fortune in his post\u2013White House life . He often claims that \u201c they \u201d call him \u201c Middle-Class Joe. \u201d ( As far as I can tell , he is the only person who calls himself this . ) But he \u2019 s always had a weakness for grand old houses , even before he could really afford them , and an odd habit of referring to his properties by nicknames : North Star ( for the Delaware village in which it was located ) , the Station ( his once-bustling home in Wilmington ) , and the Lake House ( self-explanatory ) . What does Anne call the Homestead in which she lives ? \u201c Well , nothing , \u201d she said , laughing .\nYou could tell the story of Biden \u2019 s astonishingly long political career through Anne and through this house .\nShe first learned there was an interesting man who had once lived here in 1972 , when she saw Biden \u2019 s ads on TV . At the time , he was running for the U.S. Senate against Cale Boggs , a powerful Republican who had won seven consecutive elections in Delaware , climbing from Congress to the governor \u2019 s mansion and ultimately to the Senate . Boggs was 63 , and Biden , who at 29 wouldn \u2019 t even be eligible to serve in the office he was seeking until two weeks after Election Day , used his seniority against him . \u201c We need some new thinking , \u201d read one of Biden \u2019 s advertisements . \u201c He understands what \u2019 s happening today , \u201d read another . \u201c My husband said to me \u2014 he watched him all the time on TV \u2014 and he \u2019 d say , \u2018 Ah , he \u2019 s going to be something someday , \u2019 \u201d Anne said .\nIn 1988 , when Biden was running for president the first time , reporters and authors began knocking on Anne \u2019 s door . A boy who lived down the street brought her a signed photo Biden had addressed to her , thanking her for her cooperation in this strange endeavor .\nBy her count , Biden himself has visited the Homestead six times over the years , once privately with his late mother , who refused to get out of the car despite Anne assuring her that the visit was not a disturbance , and other trips with the media and even Hillary Clinton .\n\u201c He came another time with Terry Moran from Nightline , and they walked across the street . At that time , I had a leg done , and so my niece was sitting where you are \u201d \u2014 she gestured to my chair \u2014 \u201c and she said , \u2018 I think that \u2019 s Joe Biden coming. \u2019 I thought , No , he was here two weeks ago . My nephew stood up , and he said , \u2018 Anne , it is Joe Biden. \u2019 They had left a message on my phone and I didn \u2019 t hear it . \u201d\nIn 2008 , the Obama-Biden campaign staged a formal event here with 400 people plus Secret Service sweeping through and rows of seating set up next door for reporters . Biden went upstairs to his old bedroom and signed the wall . Anne keeps photos from that day in an album underneath the television , and in them , Biden can be seen writing in black Sharpie , I AM HOME \u2014 JOE BIDEN 9 * 1 * 08 . By then , Biden had served in the Senate for 25 years and run for president twice \u2014 once disastrously , ending in a plagiarism scandal , and once unremarkably , ending in a vice-presidential campaign .\nThe whole neighborhood , Anne said , took pride in him , supported him . Even the old lady across the street , whose sons told her she wasn \u2019 t allowed to speak to reporters or let them into the house anymore , still loves Joe Biden .\nAge isn \u2019 t just a weakness for Biden . There are a lot of old people in America , and many of them really like the former vice-president . They don \u2019 t see a doddering , out-of-touch , exhausted man , as the 20- and 30- and 40-somethings who cover the campaign and dominate social media do . They look at him and see , well , a statesman from the popular recent administration who has moved to the left as the party has , if not quite as much as his younger rivals . These are the people that really vote in elections , and , to them , that all seems pretty good . \u201c I worry when I read that he is even with somebody . I just read a piece this morning that he \u2019 s even with the Warren lady , \u201d Anne said .\n\u201c I really think he \u2019 d be wonderful in getting us back with the people that are overseas . I think he \u2019 s wonderful dealing with people . I would definitely support him . I think he knows what \u2019 s going on with all those people \u2026 He \u2019 s a wonderful man . He really is wonderful , and he cares about people . \u201d\nA few days after I left the Homestead , Biden gave a speech at the Scranton Cultural Center . At the last minute , he decided to make an unplanned stop on North Washington Avenue . As photographers snapped away from the sidewalk , Anne answered the door . Biden wrapped her in a hug .\n* This article appears in the October 28 , 2019 , issue of \u2588\u2588\u2588 . Subscribe Now !",
    "content_original": "Vice President Joe Biden at a campaign rally in Philadelphia on May 18, 2019. Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nInevitably, he arrives late, by SUV or van. The former vice-president is thin and, yes, he\u2019s old. He dresses neatly and always in blue. Staff envelop him. There\u2019s the body man, the advance man, the videographer, the photographer, the digital director, the traveling chief of staff, the traveling press secretary, the local press secretary, the adviser, the other adviser, the adviser\u2019s adviser, the surrogate, the other surrogate, and the bodyguard.\n\nThe looming presence of the last guy, Jim, is especially important for optics. Jim is tall and official-looking. He greets the world chest-first, his hands resting in a dignified clasp, his expression even, his mouth unmoving. Most people assume that he\u2019s a Secret Service agent. Which he was.\n\nBut ex-VPs don\u2019t get security for life the way ex-presidents do. Most people don\u2019t know that, not even the politically savvy types who attend these sorts of things. And that\u2019s all for the best, because Jim \u2014 or whatever local guy they\u2019ve got filling in for him in Iowa or New Hampshire or Nevada or wherever else \u2014 is a necessary component of the vibe they\u2019re trying to generate here, the Big Presidential Energy, if you will, that powers this production.\n\nAnd it is a production. This is true even when the event is small, which it often is, because the stakes never are \u2014 Joe Biden speaking off the cuff is something the entire campaign seems focused on preventing at all costs. Inside the community center or union hall or college auditorium, the stage is crafted just so. The red and blue letters \u2014 each roughly the size of a 9-year-old \u2014 spell IOWA 4 BIDEN. The American flag is stretched taut and stapled to the plywood. The lawn sign is stapled to the lectern. The delicate panes of teleprompter glass angle to meet his hopeful gaze, so that he may absorb the programmed speech as he peers out at his audience, which usually skews quite old and white, unless he\u2019s in South Carolina.\n\nThis first part \u2014 the reading of the speech \u2014 he almost always gets right. Even when he makes changes, rearranging the order of the words, skipping over a few, adding others, how could he not get it right? He\u2019s been delivering some version of it for more than 40 years and living it for longer. He could deliver it in his sleep, if he ever sleeps. It\u2019s like my father always said: Joey, a job is about more than just a paycheck. It\u2019s about your dignity. It\u2019s about being able to look your child in the eye and say, \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be okay \u2026\u201d There is an undercurrent of shame that pulses throughout, this idea that the unequalness of our society is embarrassing for those who have access to less, rather than embarrassing for those who have more than anyone could need.\n\nFolks \u2026 Not a joke! He\u2019s always saying something rather solemn, about cancer or immigration, and then adding, \u201cNot a joke!\u201d as if anyone thought it might be. I\u2019m being serious here \u2026 Come on \u2026 The bottom line is \u2026 I\u2019m not kidding around \u2026 The fact of the matter is \u2026 Barack and me \u2026 Folks \u2026 Folks \u2026 Folks \u2026 folks \u2026 folks \u2026 folks \u2026 folks \u2026 folks \u2026 folks \u2026 folks \u2026 FOLKS \u2026 folks \u2026 FoLkS \u2026 fOlKs \u2026 F. O. L. K. S. \u2026\n\nAnd this next part \u2014 the greeting of the voters \u2014 he gets right, too. In this context, he possesses an almost mystical quality that, for whatever reason, does not come across when filtered through the kaleidoscope of newsprint or television. It\u2019s the way he focuses his eyes, which are as blue as the seas, except for (yikes) that time the left eye filled with blood on CNN a few weeks back.\n\nHe is swarmed. Women reach out to him, linking their arms in his. He bows his head and lifts their hands to his mouth for a kiss and, later, when you ask them if that makes them uncomfortable, they look at you like you have three heads. This is the best day of their lives. Are you insane? There are men, too, who embrace him, wrapping their hands around his neck. He calls every male-presenting human he encounters \u201cman.\u201d I watched him call a baby \u201cman.\u201d As in, Hey! How\u00adareya, man?! He is as skilled a selfie-taker as any influencer, and in the span of 30 or 40 minutes, he snaps hundreds, leaning his body against the rope that separates him from the crowd, straining it one, two, three feet forward. He really does connect with every living being this way, talking about their jobs or their health care as he listens, sometimes crying with them, whispering in their ears, taking their phone numbers and promising to call them. He does, in fact, do that. Everybody is Joe Biden\u2019s long-lost friend. Every baby is Joe Biden\u2019s long-lost child. A little girl in Iowa City called him her uncle Joe. On the Fourth of July in the town of Independence, he took off, running through the parade like a dingo with somebody\u2019s newborn. As hard as it might be to believe that anything in this realm could not be bullshit, it\u2019s simply true that this isn\u2019t.\n\nHis own loss is staggering in its scale and cruelty: Neilia, his wife, and Naomi, his infant daughter, killed in a car crash. Beau, his oldest son, who survived that crash with his brother, Hunter, killed decades later by brain cancer. And it\u2019s as though in that loss he\u2019s gained access to an otherwise imperceptible wavelength on which he communicates in this way, with the eyes and the hands.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to describe it, but sometimes some people would walk up with a lot of emotion in their face, and without even hearing their story, he could connect with them,\u201d John Flynn, who served as Biden\u2019s senior adviser in the White House, said. \u201cHe would know it was either one thing or another, and he would just know how to approach them and to get them to gently open up if they wanted to. And if they didn\u2019t want to, he just said, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m with you, and I\u2019m there for you. I feel your pain.\u2019 \u201d\n\nChris Coons was an intern for Biden in the Senate and is now a United States senator from Delaware himself. He told me about Loretta Wootten, a former colleague who in January went into a coma after a car crash that killed her husband. \u201cI went to visit Loretta when she regained consciousness, and she looks at me, and she says, \u2018Does Joe know I\u2019m here?\u2019 That\u2019s her first sentence. I said, \u2018I don\u2019t know. I mean, he\u2019s running for president.\u2019 And, she says, \u2018I just would love to hear from him.\u2019 The next time I see him, I say, \u2018Do you remember Loretta Wootten?\u2019 and he smiles and he says, \u2018Of course.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, Loretta\u2019s husband was just killed in a car accident, and she\u2019s in recovery.\u2019 And he gets this look, and he turned to someone and said, \u2018Get me a piece of paper.\u2019 And he writes out this page-long, heartfelt message to her, hands it to me, and says, \u2018Please get this to her.\u2019 When I delivered that to her, she wept with joy.\u201d\n\nI have witnessed this kind of connection at nearly all of the countless events I\u2019ve attended in a half-dozen states in the six months since Biden announced his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. If he ever does sleep, surely Joe Biden dreams as he proselytizes, of an unbroken America, its ideals and reputation restored, where everybody is folks and folks have everything they need and maybe some of what they want, where the field is just even enough that nobody is ashamed of their own place on it, and where the president isn\u2019t an idiot but where you can easily deal with the idiots by kicking the shit out of them out back in a parking lot or something. Crucially, in this dream, Joe Biden is the president.\n\nA campaign event in New Hampshire in October. Photo: M. Scott Brauer\n\nThe pitch goes like this: Joe Biden ought to be the nominee because he\u2019s electable, a meaningless concept if recent history is any guide, and presidential, that wonderful word \u2014 the thing Donald Trump could never be even though he literally is president \u2014 despite the fact that Biden, who appears by almost any measure to be a good man, a man whose lone sin in life is ego (and does that even count anymore?), has spent a half-century grasping for this position and watching it slip through his fingers.\n\nTo anyone paying attention \u2014 the army of political professionals more wired to observe shortcomings than are those likely to actually vote for him or for anyone else \u2014 it looks, unmistakably, like it\u2019s happening again. His vulnerabilities are close to the surface. There\u2019s the basic fact of his oldness and the concerns, explicit or implicit, about his ability to stay agile and alive for four more years. This was true of Biden, who is 76, even more than it was true of Bernie Sanders, who is the oldest candidate at 78, up until Sanders had a heart attack while campaigning in Nevada earlier this month. (It\u2019s not true at all of Elizabeth Warren, who is 70 but seems a decade younger. And it\u2019s not exactly true of Trump, who is 73 and really just seems crazy, not old.)\n\nBut it\u2019s not just his age itself. It\u2019s his tendency to misspeak, his inartful debating style, and \u2014 most of all \u2014 his status as a creature from another time in the Democratic Party, when the politics of race and crime and gender were unrecognizably different. It\u2019s not just that the Joe Biden of yesteryear sometimes peeks out from behind the No. 1 Obama Stan costume. It\u2019s that the Joe Biden of today is expected to hold his former self accountable to the new standards set by a culture that\u2019s prepared to reject him. And though he\u2019s the party Establishment\u2019s obvious exemplar, he can\u2019t seem to raise any money \u2014 spending more in the last quarter than he brought in and moving into the homestretch with less than $9 million in the bank (roughly a third of what Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders has on hand). For political reporters, marveling every day at just how well this isn\u2019t going, watching Biden can feel like being at the rodeo. You\u2019re there because on some level you know you might see someone get killed.\n\nYet Biden is still the front-runner. Volatile and potentially worthless as they may be, it\u2019s what the polls say. Biden leads the field on average by a handful of percentage points, though his lead has trended steadily downward, from a high of 33 in May to 20 in June to 11, and then to 9.9, and 6.6, and 5.4, according to RealClearPolitics. In the whole campaign, there has only been one day \u2014 October 8 \u2014 when he slipped to second place, an average of 0.2 points behind Warren. He\u2019s also the front-runner in South Carolina, Nevada, California, Texas, North Carolina, and Florida. \u201cThere is this sense of hanging on. And perhaps he can. But that\u2019s generally not the way the physics of these things work,\u201d former Obama adviser David Axelrod told me. \u201cGenerally, you\u2019re either moving up or moving down. Warren is clearly moving up. There\u2019s no sign that he is.\u201d\n\nBiden is aware that it\u2019s not going well. But it\u2019s not apparent that he knows how to fix it. Recently, according to his staff, his anxieties have manifested more visibly. If he begins to question something small, he spirals, eventually questioning everything. Should he be saying this in his speech? Wait, should he be giving this speech at all? Should he even be focusing on this group? Is this even the right position? He freaks out over minor stuff on the trail that staffers don\u2019t believe he should be concerning himself with and yet is unable to make strategic adjustments. But the staff concern themselves with unimportant matters, too, running what they think is a general-election campaign when they need to be running a primary. Inside the campaign, the Biden brain trust seems to exist more to comfort the candidate than to compel him, and strategy meetings inevitably devolve into meandering, ruminative roundtables that feel purposeless except to fill time in the day. Nobody will tell the candidate in plain terms what they think he needs to change. Not that Biden really listens anyway.\n\nSome on the campaign still believe he can win, in part because they believe he should win. But even to them, the path to a collapse seems clear: Biden loses in Iowa and New Hampshire, where his leads have been steadily declining for months and where, recently, Elizabeth Warren has overtaken him, and then, as a result, loses his sheer aura of electability, too. But inside the campaign, they reportedly see another path, though it might not seem, at first, an optimistic one: Okay, so he loses Iowa and then New Hampshire, but so what? Because he is who he is and represents what he represents \u2014 the embodiment of both the white-working-class model of the electorate and the glow of the Obama years \u2014 he can weather the losses and march to victory through Super Tuesday and beyond. \u201cTheir theory is a long, twilight struggle where they accumulate delegates everywhere as minority voters start playing a larger role,\u201d Axelrod said. \u201cBut in reality, it\u2019s tough to be a winner when you keep losing or at least appear to be.\u201d\n\nBiden would obviously like you to think about his age as experience, but another way of thinking about experience is as a record. He\u2019s got a long one. When he was elected to the Senate, Pete Buttigieg was still a decade away from birth. There\u2019s a lot of material, then, for Biden\u2019s critics to work with. All sorts of stuff that doesn\u2019t age well, or doesn\u2019t quite compute, in this season of absolutism: Anita Hill and allegations that he violated the personal space of several women, controversy over his crusade against busing as a desegregation measure and his eagerness to work with segregationist lawmakers. Last week, after Biden attacked Trump for calling his impeachment a \u201clynching,\u201d video emerged of Biden calling Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment the same thing. If it was relevant to American political life at any point since Richard Nixon was president, Biden probably said something about it, but it\u2019s new to many younger voters and activists and talking heads now.\n\nMany of them treat Biden\u2019s talking as yet another symptom of his age, but Biden has always been like this. \u201cHis major defect is that he goes on and on and on,\u201d Orrin Hatch told the Washington Post in 1986, when Biden was 43. To say he overcame his childhood stutter would be a bad joke, like one of those I BEAT ANOREXIA T-shirts they sell on the Jersey boardwalk in size XXXL.\n\nIn Des Moines, in August, he told a crowd, \u201cPoor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.\u201d Realizing what he\u2019d done, he tried to correct himself. \u201cWealthy kids,\u201d he said, \u201cblack kids, Asian kids. No, I really mean it, but think how we think about it.\u201d Two weeks later, in Keene, New Hampshire, he said, \u201cI love this place. Look, what\u2019s not to like about Vermont in terms of the beauty of it? And what a neat town. This is sort of a scenic, beautiful town.\u201d (When he returned to New Hampshire the following month, a protester held a sign that read WELCOME TO VERMONT, JOE.) And so on.\n\nBiden is cocooned by family, longtime advisers, and former White House staff. His wife Jill, Val, Mike Donilon, Ted Kaufman, Bruce Reed, Annie Tomasini, Tony Blinken, Steve Ricchetti, Ron Klain. But beyond that small circle, veterans are harder to find on his campaign. Biden is chronically slow to make decisions, and his late entry into the race, which came months after many of his competitors, was an additional challenge to staffing the campaign. Many working at Biden headquarters in Philadelphia have no experience on a presidential campaign, and some have never worked on any campaign at all; even those closest to the candidate address him, deferentially, as \u201csir.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of these folks who have never worked on a presidential before are like, \u2018Okay, I\u2019m working for the former vice-president!\u2019 They don\u2019t really feel like it\u2019s slipping,\u201d one senior campaign adviser told me. \u201cThere\u2019s such reverence for getting to work for the vice-president that I think, for some of those folks, there\u2019s a mentality of How could we possibly lose? He\u2019s who he is. I don\u2019t think they see that that\u2019s not all it\u2019s gonna take.\u201d (Yes, even Biden\u2019s staff say \u201cfolks\u201d the way others say \u201clike\u201d or \u201cum.\u201d)\n\nFor many of these staffers, the campaign feels like it should be a coronation. Joe Biden 2020 isn\u2019t a labor of love or ideology. It\u2019s about the proper order of things. It\u2019s about who\u2019s entitled to what. It\u2019s the vehicle by which the Democratic Party Establishment arrives once more to power, the displaced Obama and Clinton professionals reinstalled at the levers. If the Republic is spared in the process \u2014 which everybody genuinely wants, sure! \u2014 that\u2019s a plus. And it\u2019s great branding. When it comes to the enthusiasm voters wear on their sleeves for Warren or Sanders, the Biden campaign strikes a cool, dismissive pose, as if it could be believed that a candidate for president weren\u2019t preoccupied with such metrics.\n\nThe activist wing of the party is a lost cause to Biden just as he\u2019s a lost cause to them. When they show up at his speeches to confront him or protest in support of the Green New Deal, something I\u2019ve witnessed twice in New Hampshire, he attempts to formulate what he surely believes is a respectful response, and yet they don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough, because nothing that he says could be enough because of who he is. Can you blame anyone under the age of 30 for their cynicism, for their hostility?\n\n\u201cInternally, there was always this idea that there would be some point when he wasn\u2019t No. 1,\u201d one senior campaign adviser swears. \u201cTo some extent, people were prepped for that. There isn\u2019t a culture inside the campaign right now like, This is a done deal and we\u2019ve lost. The culture is, This is getting real. People are still reacting to that. The question is: Does this now change our strategy and our culture? That\u2019s where we are right now, figuring out what this new stature means.\u201d\n\nWhere they are, if you\u2019re keeping track, is slumped. And it\u2019s a strange dynamic \u2014 the most qualified candidate in the race, surrounded by entitled staff who don\u2019t understand that they have to fight for the nomination, or even the presidency, but without a real case to make beyond a Democratic succession that would amount to an Obama restoration. \u201cHe has no center,\u201d as one person close to the Biden family put it. \u201cHe\u2019s literally only a politician. That\u2019s who he is. That\u2019s all he is. Biden is fundamentally a toadie. He\u2019s just political. He needs to kiss ass? He\u2019ll kiss ass.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have him in the candidate-protection program,\u201d Axelrod says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you can do that. I don\u2019t know if you can get through a whole campaign that way. Either he can hack it or he can\u2019t hack it. If you\u2019re worried the candidate can hurt himself talking to a reporter, that\u2019s a bad sign.\u201d (Biden declined to be interviewed for this story.)\n\nFor his part, Biden is consumed with his endorsements, another sign of his perhaps outdated political instincts; getting insiders to declare their support meant something when powerful political machines controlled the primary process, but it has much less relevance to presidential politics today. And the only endorsement that could matter hasn\u2019t materialized. President Barack Obama has remained silent on the 2020 primary even as he saw it fit to involve himself in Canadian affairs, endorsing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. A senior White House official, reflecting on Biden\u2019s weakness, told me Biden should have never even entered the race without knowing he\u2019d have the former president\u2019s support.\n\nOf course, that was always less of a sure thing than it might have seemed. In 2016, Obama went all-in for Hillary, even as his vice-president contemplated a run. In the early stages of this race, he didn\u2019t just avoid aligning himself with Biden but gestured toward other candidates, including unlikely contender Deval Patrick, the former governor of Massachusetts, possibly to discourage his former veep from running.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Hunter Biden himself, who was going to become an issue one way or another. The 49-year-old son of privilege and tragedy, he has had struggles with addiction and run-ins with the law that have been well-documented. The campaign did its best to control the subject, cooperating with a tell-all interview over the summer in which Hunter candidly discussed his drug use and his relationship with his brother\u2019s widow. This is sometimes how flacks think they\u2019ll get ahead of a story: You neuter the shock value by delivering the shock yourself. But when your son is a central character in an impeachment saga likely to preoccupy all of Washington and political news for six months, it\u2019s a hard thing to get ahead of, especially when you don\u2019t really seem to want to engage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of bewildering,\u201d Axelrod says. \u201cI guess I understand it from a familial, psychological sense. It would just be so much better if he stated the obvious: Even Hunter has said he exercised poor judgment. He won\u2019t even say what his kid said. It\u2019s an obvious question as to why the rules that he\u2019s going to apply in the future didn\u2019t apply in the past. All this was foreseeable \u2026 You can\u2019t say, \u2018He did nothing wrong,\u2019 and, \u2018He\u2019ll never do it again.\u2019 Those things don\u2019t go together. Biden can be stubborn. I think his stubbornness is showing here.\u201d All of that said, Axelrod added, \u201cwhat Trump is doing is loathsome and outrageous because there\u2019s no evidence that Biden did anything wrong or that Hunter did anything wrong.\u201d\n\nIn a certain sense, impeachment creates for Biden what he wanted all along: a direct competition with Trump. Looked at it one way, it\u2019s a story about how the president of the United States was so worried about his formidable opponent that he risked his entire presidency, and even broke the law, to try to stop him. But in other ways, it\u2019s exactly what Biden hoped to avoid: a focus on his most troubled child, the last remaining member of his first family, and the privilege his political and celebrity status affords. Even if he didn\u2019t do anything \u201cwrong,\u201d Trump is right that there\u2019s a swamp, though he doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s its ugliest creature, and impeachment is a daily reminder that Biden swims there, too. Who could withstand an entire year of character assassination by the president, who is aided by a political media that projects his every statement to the world?\n\nPhoto: Mark Peterson/Redux/Mark Peterson/Redux\n\nAt the Iowa State Fair in August, as candidates took to the stage to deliver their stump speeches and answer questions from the Des Moines Register, I stood off to the side with a few members of the press. We craned our necks downward to squint at a zoomed-in photo of the side of Joe Biden\u2019s head. There, just behind the ear, is where you can supposedly observe the scar from a face-lift, one of many cosmetic procedures Biden is rumored to have had.\n\nThe dramatic change to Biden\u2019s appearance is a matter of preoccupation for Biden-watchers. In the timeline of images from throughout his career, you can observe as he grows older and then younger and then older but somehow more elegant and alert. His hair is white now but thicker than it was in the 1980s. He\u2019s thinner, but his cheeks are fuller than they were in 2008. To be honest with you, he looks good. He\u2019s almost 77!\n\nThis is also a minor obsession of the White House, as you can probably imagine. Privately, Trump has marveled at the \u201cwork\u201d Biden has had done and the fact that, in his opinion, he doesn\u2019t look any better for it. Those who know him say the president is against plastic surgery (by which I assume they don\u2019t mean breast implants) and, especially, bad plastic surgery, and he considers it an all-too-common tragedy when someone has their face inexpertly altered.\n\nA senior White House official who regularly discusses the campaign with Trump was describing how his view of Biden has evolved since the winter. It was then, before Biden declared, that the campaign began conducting polling and sharing the results with Trump himself. The internal numbers were as bad as the external. Biden destroyed Trump. The president\u2019s anxieties only grew as Biden became a more popular topic on cable news. \u201cIt was easy to get caught up,\u201d this official said. \u201cThe president saw that it\u2019s easier to picture Joe Biden up on the debate stage than some of the others.\u201d\n\nOver time, as Biden formally waded into the race, and the president saw the reality of the candidate as opposed to the idea of Vice-President Joe Biden, he grew less concerned, according to the senior White House official. Biden was no longer \u201cthe guy he was worried about.\u201d And one of the reasons was, in Trumpian fashion, \u201chis look.\u201d Though the official adds a few more items to the list as well: \u201cHis cadence. His inability to speak. His small crowds.\u201d\n\nTrump has also commented on Biden\u2019s wardrobe choices, wondering why he\u2019d wear Ralph Lauren polo shirts on the campaign trail that show off his graying chest hair and skinny arms. (Trump himself wears polo shirts almost exclusively while golfing).\n\nInside the White House and the reelection campaign, the true believers know how to decode Trump\u2019s bitchy nicknames for his competitors. As iconic as \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d and \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d may be, his crowning achievement remains \u201cLow Energy,\u201d his characterization of Jeb Bush. \u201cSleepy Joe\u201d is considered Trump\u2019s attempt at a 2020 remake of \u201cLow Energy,\u201d and it\u2019s all about emphasizing Biden\u2019s age.\n\nIn September, somebody had the bright idea to stage an afternoon event under the open sky at the Indian Creek Nature Center in sunny Cedar Rapids. It was the day after news of the whistle-blower broke, but Biden stuck to the event\u2019s topic, climate change, addressing all the usual themes. Then faces began turning upward to the birds overhead. Somebody from Showtime\u2019s The Circus told me the birds were bald eagles, but at the time I thought they looked like hawks, which, I guess, is a sort of glass-half-empty or -half-full dilemma. Eventually, word of the alleged bald eagles made its way to Biden, and with a look of optimism, he turned his face to the sky. He grew emotional. He said that at the Lake House, Beau used to sit by the water and watch the bald eagles fly overhead. The night Beau died, in 2015, Biden said he watched an eagle take off from the lake, circle in the sky, and then fly away. He hadn\u2019t seen another bald eagle since that night, he said, until now. Looking at the bird, he said, \u201cMaybe that\u2019s my Beau.\u201d\n\nBiden wrote a book about his grief, and about his son, called Promise Me, Dad. Therein, he tells a similar story, but with a different bird. That night, he wrote, \u201cJill spotted a white egret at the far edge of the water.\u201d She told her husband that, as he lay dying, she whispered to Beau to go to the dock, \u201chis happy place,\u201d with his brother. \u201cWe watched the egret for twenty minutes, until it finally took flight,\u201d Biden wrote. \u201cThe two of us sat in silence as the egret circled overhead repeatedly, slowly gaining altitude, until it finally headed away to the south, beneath the clouds, and gradually disappeared from sight. \u2018It\u2019s a sign from God,\u2019 Jill said. \u2018Beau being at the lake one last time, and heading for heaven.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAnne Kearns is an 84-year-old grandmother of 16 and retired professor. For 58 years, she has lived in the modest blue house with black shutters on North Washington Avenue in Scranton, Pennsylvania, where Joe Biden lived during the first decade of his life.\n\n\u201cHe calls this \u2018the Homestead,\u2019 \u201d she told me last Sunday. We were sitting in the living room, surrounded by framed photos of her large family and one photo of Biden, propped up on the TV stand. For most of his career, Biden was among the least-wealthy members of Congress, an attractive bullet point that he continues to note even after amassing a fortune in his post\u2013White House life. He often claims that \u201cthey\u201d call him \u201cMiddle-Class Joe.\u201d (As far as I can tell, he is the only person who calls himself this.) But he\u2019s always had a weakness for grand old houses, even before he could really afford them, and an odd habit of referring to his properties by nicknames: North Star (for the Delaware village in which it was located), the Station (his once-bustling home in Wilmington), and the Lake House (self-explanatory). What does Anne call the Homestead in which she lives? \u201cWell, nothing,\u201d she said, laughing.\n\nYou could tell the story of Biden\u2019s astonishingly long political career through Anne and through this house.\n\nShe first learned there was an interesting man who had once lived here in 1972, when she saw Biden\u2019s ads on TV. At the time, he was running for the U.S. Senate against Cale Boggs, a powerful Republican who had won seven consecutive elections in Delaware, climbing from Congress to the governor\u2019s mansion and ultimately to the Senate. Boggs was 63, and Biden, who at 29 wouldn\u2019t even be eligible to serve in the office he was seeking until two weeks after Election Day, used his seniority against him. \u201cWe need some new thinking,\u201d read one of Biden\u2019s advertisements. \u201cHe understands what\u2019s happening today,\u201d read another. \u201cMy husband said to me \u2014 he watched him all the time on TV \u2014 and he\u2019d say, \u2018Ah, he\u2019s going to be something someday,\u2019 \u201d Anne said.\n\nIn 1988, when Biden was running for president the first time, reporters and authors began knocking on Anne\u2019s door. A boy who lived down the street brought her a signed photo Biden had addressed to her, thanking her for her cooperation in this strange endeavor.\n\nBy her count, Biden himself has visited the Homestead six times over the years, once privately with his late mother, who refused to get out of the car despite Anne assuring her that the visit was not a disturbance, and other trips with the media and even Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cHe came another time with Terry Moran from Nightline, and they walked across the street. At that time, I had a leg done, and so my niece was sitting where you are\u201d \u2014 she gestured to my chair \u2014 \u201cand she said, \u2018I think that\u2019s Joe Biden coming.\u2019 I thought, No, he was here two weeks ago. My nephew stood up, and he said, \u2018Anne, it is Joe Biden.\u2019 They had left a message on my phone and I didn\u2019t hear it.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, the Obama-Biden campaign staged a formal event here with 400 people plus Secret Service sweeping through and rows of seating set up next door for reporters. Biden went upstairs to his old bedroom and signed the wall. Anne keeps photos from that day in an album underneath the television, and in them, Biden can be seen writing in black Sharpie, I AM HOME \u2014 JOE BIDEN 9 * 1 * 08. By then, Biden had served in the Senate for 25 years and run for president twice \u2014 once disastrously, ending in a plagiarism scandal, and once unremarkably, ending in a vice-presidential campaign.\n\nThe whole neighborhood, Anne said, took pride in him, supported him. Even the old lady across the street, whose sons told her she wasn\u2019t allowed to speak to reporters or let them into the house anymore, still loves Joe Biden.\n\nAge isn\u2019t just a weakness for Biden. There are a lot of old people in America, and many of them really like the former vice-president. They don\u2019t see a doddering, out-of-touch, exhausted man, as the 20- and 30- and 40-somethings who cover the campaign and dominate social media do. They look at him and see, well, a statesman from the popular recent administration who has moved to the left as the party has, if not quite as much as his younger rivals. These are the people that really vote in elections, and, to them, that all seems pretty good. \u201cI worry when I read that he is even with somebody. I just read a piece this morning that he\u2019s even with the Warren lady,\u201d Anne said.\n\n\u201cI really think he\u2019d be wonderful in getting us back with the people that are overseas. I think he\u2019s wonderful dealing with people. I would definitely support him. I think he knows what\u2019s going on with all those people \u2026 He\u2019s a wonderful man. He really is wonderful, and he cares about people.\u201d\n\nA few days after I left the Homestead, Biden gave a speech at the Scranton Cultural Center. At the last minute, he decided to make an unplanned stop on North Washington Avenue. As photographers snapped away from the sidewalk, Anne answered the door. Biden wrapped her in a hug.\n\n*This article appears in the October 28, 2019, issue of New York Magazine. Subscribe Now!",
