Then the April jobs report was released Friday morning , and now some economists are doing a double-take .\nThe economy added 165,000 jobs in April , according to the Labor Department . That was more than the 140,000 jobs economists expected , and it marked an improvement over March .\nThe even bigger story , though , came from large revisions to earlier numbers . It 's a common practice for the Labor Department to revise its data for the two prior months , and this time , those revisions showed an additional 114,000 jobs were added in the U.S. economy over February and March alone .\nPreviously , March hiring had looked particularly weak , with only 88,000 jobs added that month . Now , the Labor Department says 138,000 jobs were added in March .\nFebruary job growth , which had already looked solid , now looks even stronger . About 332,000 jobs were added in February , making it the strongest month for hiring since the Census hired temporary workers in 2010 .\nThe report goes a long way `` toward soothing fears of another spring slowdown , '' said Paul Ashworth , chief U.S. economist for Capital Economics .\nEconomists had been warning of a spring swoon for the third year in a row , this time driven largely by government spending cuts and global economic weakness . Retail sales slumped unexpectedly in March , the manufacturing sector stalled in April , and signs abroad point to a global deceleration .

Overall , federal , state and local governments cut 11,000 jobs in April .\nThe bigger picture , however , remains static . About 11.7 million people remain unemployed , and the unemployment rate fell to 7.5 % in April , but that 's still high compared to historical levels .
