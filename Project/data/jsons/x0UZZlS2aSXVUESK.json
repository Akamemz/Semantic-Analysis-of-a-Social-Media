    "content": "The increasingly nasty public tone of the Democratic presidential race is also playing out behind the scenes , with superdelegates committed to Hillary Clinton facing a barrage of abusive and threatening emails urging them to switch allegiance and back her opponent , Sen. Bernard Sanders .\nThe guerrilla tactics include vows to try to oust Clinton supporters from office or threats to withhold funding from the Democratic Party .\nBut superdelegates reached by The \u2588\u2588\u2588 said they won \u2019 t be bullied .\n\u201c It goes with the territory . I have thick skin . But you \u2019 re not going to [ get ] people like myself to support your candidate by making threats , \u201d said Ken Martin , chairman of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party and a superdelegate backing Mrs. Clinton .\nHe said he receives between 10 and 20 threatening emails daily and gets just as many abusive phone calls , which he said were spurred by a Sanders supporter posting his cellphone number online .\nSuperdelegates are a unique part of Democrats \u2019 nominating process . In addition to the delegates won at the ballot box , the party grants delegate status to 712 Democratic bigwigs , who are able to vote for whomever they want at the convention .\nMrs. Clinton has locked up the support of 469 superdelegates so far , while Mr. Sanders has 31 , according to the tally kept by The Associated Press .\nUnless he \u2019 s able to get some of Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s backers to switch and support him , his path to the nomination is realistically very narrow .\nMr. Sanders has publicly urged Clinton supporters to defect , and his supporters have taken up the cry , particularly in states the senator won at the ballot box or in caucuses .\nPro-Clinton superdelegates targeted in Minnesota , where Mr. Sanders trounced Mrs. Clinton 61 percent to 38 percent in Democratic caucuses , included Gov . Mark Dayton and U.S. Sens . Al Frankin and Amy Klobuchar , as well as state party officials and national committeemen .\nBut even those in states won by Mrs. Clinton are feeling the heat .\nJocelyn Bucaro , chair of the Democratic Party executive committee in Butler Country , Ohio , and a superdelegate committed to Mrs. Clinton , said she gets cajoled with phone calls , emails and Facebook messages \u2014 though she didn \u2019 t describe them as threatening .\n\u201c Their arguments are mostly to follow the will of the voters of Ohio , \u201d said Ms. Bucaro . She said it made her \u201c giggle \u201d because Mrs. Clinton won Ohio by a wide margin .\nStill , she said that she respects \u201c their passion for their candidate . \u201d\n\u201c I think it is wonderful the they feel so strongly for their candidate . I hope , when this process is over , they will come out and support the nominee and support Democrats up and down the ticket , \u201d said Ms. Bucaro .\nA recent McClatchy-Marist Poll suggested that Mr. Sanders \u2018 supporters won \u2019 t come together for the sake of the party if Mrs. Clinton , as expected , becomes the nominee .\nThe poll found that 25 percent of his supporters said they would not back Mrs. Clinton in a general election . What \u2019 s more , Mr. Sanders edged out Mrs. Clinton 49 percent to 47 percent in the national survey .\nThose numbers underscore Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s vulnerabilities in the 2016 race , both as a primary candidate who can \u2019 t seem to muster the same enthusiasm as Mr. Sanders and as the likely nominee who will lose votes from the base when facing a Republican in November .\nThe Sanders campaign declined to comment on the actions of its supporters .\nThe liberal activist group Democracy for America ( DFA ) , which is backing Mr. Sanders , has been promoting a petition that calls on superdelegates to back the popularly elected nominee .\nDFA spokesman Neil Sroka said that threats have no place in politics but that it was \u201c reasonable \u201d for Minnesota voters to want the state \u2019 s superdelegates to respect the caucus results .\n\u201c It would make sense for superdelegates to reconsider who they are supporting , \u201d he said . \u201c Superdelegates should not decide who wins . The Democratic primary has to be decided by the grass-roots base of the Democratic Party \u2014 the people who vote and caucus . \u201d\nMr. Martin compared the recent move by the Sanders campaign to realign superdelegates to a late-in-the-game \u201c Hail Mary pass . \u201d\nHe insisted that he wasn \u2019 t bucking the will of Democratic voters .\n\u201c The last thing any of us superdelegates want is to throw our party into tumult , \u201d said Mr. Martin . \u201c If Bernie ends up winning the majority of elected delegates , I will support him .
