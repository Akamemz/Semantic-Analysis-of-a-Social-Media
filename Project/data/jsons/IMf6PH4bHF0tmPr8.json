    "content": "The Supreme Court indicated on Wednesday that it probably won \u2019 t blow up the 2020 election by letting 538 people you \u2019 ve never heard of pick the president . This presidential race promises to be one of the most divisive and chaotic in recent history , and courts should not inject any unnecessary mayhem . Wednesday \u2019 s cases present a superficial opportunity to send the Electoral College into a death spiral . But in reality , they ask the federal judiciary to make the Electoral College even more dangerous and undemocratic than it already is .\nThose cases , Chiafalo v. Washington and Baca v. Colorado , probe the confusing reality of America \u2019 s true presidential election , which does not occur on Election Day . Sure , millions of Americans will go to the polls in November 2020 to pick the next commander in chief . But , constitutionally speaking , they will not actually vote for president . Instead , they will vote for electors\u2014typically party operatives whose names may not even appear on the ballot . In December , those electors meet at their state capitols to cast their votes . Thirty-two states and the District of Columbia compel electors to cast their ballots for the winner of the statewide popular vote . The plaintiffs in Chiafalo and Baca are \u201c faithless electors \u201d who sought to buck these laws in 2016 and select a different candidate than the one chosen by voters of their state . They argue that the Constitution grants electors the right to vote for whomever they want . In their view , the statewide vote is essentially advisory and states have no power to punish electors who go their own way .\nThe best argument for the plaintiffs is Alexander Hamilton \u2019 s Federalist No . 68 , which envisioned electors as wise men who would exercise independent judgment . The best argument against the plaintiffs is everything else under the sun . From the early days of the republic , states have forced electors to side with the winner of the statewide vote . Nothing in the Constitution clearly prohibits this option ; to the contrary , it grants states broad power over their electors . And the practical consequences of a decision for the plaintiffs would be pandemonium : It would leave the race in the hands of a few obscure partisans who would surely face intense lobbying after Election Day . In a close race , a few \u201c faithless electors \u201d could change the outcome , raising grave questions of the winner \u2019 s legitimacy .\nHarvard Law professor Larry Lessig , who represents the plaintiffs , is aware of that possibility . Indeed , it seems to be his goal . Lessig wants to make the Electoral College so wacky and unpredictable that the entire country turns against it , then adopts a constitutional amendment creating a nationwide popular vote for president . The justices appeared to be aware of this end goal on Wednesday . And they had no apparent interest in facilitating Lessig \u2019 s master plan .\n\u201c Those who disagree with your argument , \u201d Justice Samuel Alito told Lessig , \u201c say that it would lead to chaos \u201d \u2014that in a close election , \u201c the rational response of the losing political party \u201d would be \u201c to launch a massive campaign to try to influence electors , and there would be a long period of uncertainty about who the next president was going to be. \u201d Lessig told Alito he did not \u201c deny it \u2019 s a possibility , \u201d but it \u2019 s one that hasn \u2019 t happened yet\u2014and even if it does , that \u2019 s the Constitution \u2019 s fault .\n\u201c I want to follow up on Justice Alito \u2019 s line of questioning , \u201d an alarmed Justice Brett Kavanaugh said , \u201c and what I might call the \u2018 avoid chaos \u2019 principle of judging , which suggests that if it \u2019 s a close call or tiebreaker , that we shouldn \u2019 t facilitate or create chaos. \u201d Lessig responded that \u201c the likelihood \u201d of a chaotic outcome \u201c is extremely small. \u201d Kavanaugh then flipped Lessig \u2019 s framing of the case . \u201c You set this up \u201d as \u201c the states versus the electors , \u201d he said . \u201c But isn \u2019 t it also appropriate to think of this as the voters versus the electors , and that your position would , in essence , potentially disenfranchise voters in the state ? \u201d In other words , if electors can buck the statewide vote , aren \u2019 t they nullifying thousands or millions of ballots ?\nThe justices had no apparent interest in facilitating Lessig \u2019 s master plan .\n\u201c It \u2019 s potentially true , \u201d Lessig admitted . \u201c That \u2019 s right , Your Honor. \u201d But Lessig insisted that allowing states to control electors is the greater evil . \u201c There is no tradition in America \u201d of the government \u201c exercising control over a voter , over an elector , \u201d Lessig said . \u201c Maybe in the Soviet Union , \u201d but not the United States .\nAs that exchange indicates , Lessig \u2019 s theory rests on a sleight of hand . He suggests that state control over electors presents authoritarian-style election rigging . But in reality , the states are merely directing electors to respect the result of elections . Lessig \u2019 s position isn \u2019 t democracy-enhancing\u2014it \u2019 s democracy-diminishing .\nIt is also \u201c pretty limitless , \u201d as Chief Justice John Roberts told Jason Harrow , Lessig \u2019 s associate , who argued on behalf of Colorado \u2019 s faithless electors . \u201c So the elector can decide , \u2018 I am going to flip a coin and however it comes out , that \u2019 s how I \u2019 m going to vote ? \u2019 \u201d Roberts asked Harrow . \u201c Yes , \u201d Harrow said\u2014just like senators can . \u201c They have that same discretion . \u201d\nBut with senators , Justice Clarence Thomas pointed out , \u201c there \u2019 s some degree of accountability for them when they vote a particular way . What \u2019 s the accountability here for an elector who strays from what is expected ? \u201d Harrow said , \u201c They can be kicked out of the political party. \u201d That consequence seems like small potatoes compared with losing a senatorial election , and it leaves accountability in the hands of the party , not the voters .\nJustice Elena Kagan asked Harrow why , in the absence of a clear constitutional command , federal courts shouldn \u2019 t just leave states to their own devices . \u201c What would you say if I said that if there \u2019 s silence , the best thing to do is leave it to the states and not impose any constitutional requirement on them ? \u201d Harrow said there wasn \u2019 t silence\u2014though , as Kagan reminded Lessig , there is ambiguity . \u201c Most of your argument depends on a particular reading of the terms vote and ballot and elector , \u201d Kagan said . But \u201c why do these terms necessarily involve choice in the way you suggest ? \u201d Put simply , the Constitution uses terms that we associate with free elections today . But are those terms really enough to strip states and their residents of influence over a presidential election ?\nIn light of this skepticism , Noah Purcell , who argued for Washington , and Philip Weiser , who argued for Colorado , had little to do but sound like reasonable defenders of the status quo .
