    "content": "Just as Americans prepare to express their hospitality toward others during Thanksgiving , a national debate has erupted over another kind of hospitality : President Obama \u2019 s plan to welcome 10,000 Syrian refugees into the United States . After the Paris attacks , the plan has been widely challenged , not least by nearly half the US governors . They fear Islamic State terrorists might slip in as \u201c sleepers \u201d among the refugees . Others argue back that the US already rigorously vets all asylum seekers \u2013 for as long as two years .\nMight Thanksgiving , with all its traditions and meaning , shed some light on this debate ?\nThe practice of welcoming strangers into one \u2019 s home or community long precedes the first American thanksgiving , that autumn feast of 1621 when Pilgrims and native Americans expressed gratitude for either the harvest , each other , or God \u2019 s mercy ( or all of the above ) . Hospitality is an ancient Middle East virtue , rooted in the traditions of desert tribes and deeply encoded in the three Abrahamic religions .
