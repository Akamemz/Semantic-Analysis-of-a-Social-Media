As expected , Hillary Clinton 's anticlimactic acceptance speech capped off a Democratic convention at which two of the weakest primetime speeches were delivered by the the two members of the nominated ticket . There were powerful moments earlier in the evening -- including an impactful address by the father of a Muslim US soldier who paid the ultimate sacrifice for his country in Iraq , and an address from a valorous Medal of Honor recipient , who was shamefully heckled by some DNC delegates . But when the lights shone brightest , we got a perfectly nice little talk by Chelsea Clinton , an over-the-top 'Heroine Hillary ' introductory video , and a over-long , mediocre , robotically-delivered address by the woman of the hour . Pete Wehner , a senior speechwriter for President Bush and an exceptionally harsh conservative critic of Donald Trump , rendered this assessment of her performance :\nWhat a dismal speech -- poorly written , even more poorly delivered . In the biggest speech of her life , she fell flat . \u2014 Peter Wehner ( @ Peter_Wehner ) July 29 , 2016\nSome bits were better than others , but Clinton only seemed to truly come into her own when she was attacking Donald Trump -- her longtime friend and donor , whose wedding she attended . Hillary quoted Trump 's infamous statement that he understands ISIS better than our generals . She looked into the camera , ice cold , and unleashed one of several stinging lines :\n`` No , Donald , you do n't .

If only she and Donald had taken some voice modulation lessons -- maybe ( stronger ) together ? -- a few weeks ago , things might have been better . They were n't . In any case , even if you 're inclined to agree with her temperament critiques of Trump ( as I am ) , it 's quite rich listening to a woman who knowingly compromised high-level secrets for her own selfish reasons and lied repeatedly about it lecture anyone about trust and national security . The rest of her speech was almost entirely unmemorable -- although newscasts will love her 'break the ceiling , sky 's the limit ' formulation . She talked a little bit about her upbringing and family , she tossed a few bland rhetorical scraps to independent and Republican-leaning voters , and she rattled off a laundry list of liberal-left agenda items . She made sure to highlight her strong opposition to Citizens United -- because this woman is so terribly offended by money in politics , you see -- failing to mention that the ruling she abhors literally overruled the government 's censorship of a film that was critical of ... Hillary Clinton . She also condemned `` mean and divisive rhetoric , '' which seems apt in an age of Trump . But once again , physician , heal thyself . As I predicted , Donald Trump earned a clear polling bounce out of Cleveland . It may or may not be receding .
