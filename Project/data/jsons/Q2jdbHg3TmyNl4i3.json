He said that \u2019 s what this year \u2019 s election comes down to .\n\u201c The most important question is , what kind of country do you want to live in ? \u201d Mr. Clinton said . \u201c If you want a winner-take-all , you \u2019 re-on-your-own society , you should support the Republican ticket . If you want a country of shared prosperity and shared responsibility \u2014 a we \u2019 re-all-in-this-together society \u2014 you should vote for Barack Obama . \u201d\nMr. Obama himself arrived in Charlotte Wednesday afternoon and prepared for his Thursday speech accepting his party \u2019 s nomination .\nHe had been slated to speak at Bank of America Stadium , in front of more than 65,000 cheering supporters , much as he did four years ago to a stadium audience in Denver . But his campaign on Wednesday canceled the stadium and said Thursday \u2019 s speeches will take place in the much smaller arena where the convention met on Tuesday and Wednesday .\nThe party blamed the chances of thunderstorms , and said it would hold a conference call with those who \u2019 d gotten tickets for the stadium but would now be shut out .\nRepublicans , though , said the president was afraid he wouldn \u2019 t be able to fill the stadium , which they said highlighted the gap in enthusiasm for Mr. Obama compared to 2008 , when he filled the stadium in Denver .\nDemocrats also scrambled to recover after they adopted a platform earlier this week that excluded language declaring U.S. support for Jerusalem as the capital of Israel , and dropped a mention of God that had been in previous platforms .\nOn Wednesday they held a voice vote trying to add Jerusalem and God provisions back in \u2014 but had to hold the vote several times before the \u201c Yes \u201d votes clearly out-shouted the \u201c No \u201d votes .\nThe White House had pushed to add the language back in after platform became a distraction from their message .\nDemocrats are desperate to frame this year \u2019 s election as a choice between candidates rather than a referendum on Mr. Obama \u2019 s stewardship of the economy , and have repeatedly turned to social issues to try to peel black , Hispanic and women voters away from the GOP .\nOn Wednesday Sandra Fluke , the woman who Republicans denied a chance to testify to Congress on her support for Mr. Obama \u2019 s contraceptive policy , told the convention Mr. Romney \u201c wont stand up to the slurs , or to any of the extreme , bigoted views in his own party . \u201d\nBut it was Mr. Clinton , the man who led Democrats back to the White House in the 1990s , who was left the task of explaining the sluggish economy under Mr. Obama .\n\u201c He inherited a deeply damaged economy , put a floor under the crash , began the long hard road to recovery , and laid the foundation for a more modern , more well-balances economy , \u201d Mr. Clinton said in a speech that , in typical Clinton fashion , ran more than 20 minutes past his allotted time .\nMr. Clinton laid out math he said showed that over the last half-century , Democrats and Republicans have held the White House for about the same number of years , but Democrats lead in job-creation , 42 million to 24 million .\n\u201c It turns out that advancing economic opportunity and economic empowerment is both morally right and good economics , \u201d he said , drawing repeated shouts of \u201c We love you Bill ! \u201d from delegates .\nMr. Clinton also looked past Mr. Obama \u2019 s legislative agenda such as health care and the stimulus , which he passed almost exclusively on Democratic votes , and said the president is committed to cooperation .
