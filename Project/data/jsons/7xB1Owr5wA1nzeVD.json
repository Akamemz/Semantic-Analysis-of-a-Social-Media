''\nFor his part , Obama seemed to acknowledge his political troubles at a fundraiser on Wednesday night in Chicago , telling supporters that `` sometimes we take a bad turn , sometimes we make mistakes . ''\nAt the same time , the president complained of `` obstructionism for the sake of obstructionism '' by political foes who appeared interested `` only in scoring political points or placating a base , as opposed to trying to advance the interests of the American people .
