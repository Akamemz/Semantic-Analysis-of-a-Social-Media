Still from video by ( c ) 2019 Thomson Reuters\nOn Wednesday , Lawrence VanDyke , Donald Trump \u2019 s nominee for a seat on the 9th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals , made news by crying at his confirmation hearing . He began weeping after he was confronted with a letter from the American Bar Association that had deemed him \u201c Not Qualified , \u201d a ranking based on 60 interviews with 43 lawyers , 16 judges , and one other person who had worked with him . In their dealings with VanDyke , these individuals found him to be \u201c arrogant , lazy , an ideologue , and lacking in knowledge of the day-to-day practice including procedural rules. \u201d When Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley asked him , sympathetically , about the ABA concerns over whether \u201c VanDyke would be fair to persons who are gay , lesbian , or otherwise part of the LGBTQ community , \u201d the nominee sobbed openly . Despite his years of anti-LGBTQ writings and advocacy , VanDyke was the one who felt persecuted . Did he believe , Hawley asked , that he would treat LGBTQ litigants unfairly ? \u201c I do not believe that , \u201d VanDyke said . \u201c It is a fundamental belief of mine that all people are created in the image of God , \u201d he insisted . \u201c They should all be treated with dignity and respect . \u201d\nWhat , exactly , does VanDyke have to cry about ? That someone hurt his feelings ? That after a career spent maligning and excluding gay Americans from everyday civic life , he feels entitled to glide onto an Article III court without answering for any of it ? For his entire career , he has been the one defending invidious discrimination , not suffering it . But upon being asked to answer for his anti-gay work , VanDyke did what many anti-LGBTQ advocates do today : He played the victim . He literally cried . He talked about God . And he centered his own pain . Imagine the indignity of having to answer for your years of tireless toil in opposition to marriage equality , civil rights protections for LGBTQ Americans , and the rights of gay students to join school clubs ! How awful .\nAlong with the crying , VanDyke tried to explain that his views have changed since he penned a 2004 op-ed at Harvard Law School insisting that same-sex marriage \u201c will hurt families , and consequentially children and society. \u201d He also distorted his more recent advocacy work defending anti-gay discrimination . In 2010 , he filed an amicus brief in Christian Legal Society v. Martinez on behalf of Gays and Lesbians for Individual Liberty\u2014a small group that brings together \u201c classical liberals , market liberals , limited-government libertarians , anarcho-capitalists , and objectivists \u201d to oppose nondiscrimination laws . VanDyke \u2019 s brief argued that student groups at public universities have a constitutional right to discriminate against gay students . On Wednesday , though , he was unwilling to say out loud that he had joined a group to side with religious liberty against gay students , so he pretended to have been for both .\nWhat was VanDyke and his not-qualified rating and record of anti-gay advocacy doing in front of the Senate , anyway ? Let \u2019 s pause to remember that Donald Trump could have selected a fit conservative for this seat . ( Indeed , VanDyke testified alongside Patrick Bumatay , who was rated \u201c Qualified \u201d by the ABA , has no history of inflammatory remarks and is openly gay himself . ) But instead , Trump picked someone who , by the accounts of 60 interviewees , \u201c lacks humility , has an \u2018 entitlement \u2019 temperament , does not have an open mind and does not always have a commitment to being candid and truthful . \u201d\nVanDyke is the ninth judge Trump has nominated who has received such a rating from the ABA , which has been conducting evaluations of judicial nominees since 1953 ( five of these \u201c not qualified \u201d judges have been confirmed , two were denied , and , like VanDyke , one \u2019 s nomination is still pending ) . It claims the assessments are nonpartisan evaluations and based on three metrics : professional competence , integrity , and judicial temperament . Of the 255 evaluations the ABA standing committee has completed for Trump nominations , 97 percent have been rated \u201c qualified \u201d or \u201c well qualified. \u201d Having assessments from local counsel and judges who actually work with the nominee is generally useful , which is why Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham continues to say the ratings are helpful .\nBy the accounts of 60 interviewees , VanDyke \u201c lacks humility , has an \u2018 entitlement \u2019 temperament , does not have an open mind and does not always have a commitment to being candid and truthful . \u201d\nBut at this most recent confirmation hearing , Republicans decided they \u2019 d had enough of the ABA . As Utah Sen. Mike Lee insisted on Wednesday , any group that doesn \u2019 t rate 100 percent of Donald Trump \u2019 s judicial picks as qualified is by definition biased and useless . Or as Lee put it , \u201c The ABA has essentially called you a homophobic bigot \u2026 with no apparent basis. \u201d Never mind that as Montana solicitor general in 2013 , he advocated for the state to join two abhorrent briefs arguing against marriage equality that disparaged LGBTQ families , suggesting legal recognition of same-sex partnerships would harm children . The first claimed that a prohibition on same-sex marriage was necessary to promote \u201c optimal childrearing \u201d because gay couples \u201c can not provide \u201d the optimal \u201c family structure \u201d ( the position he claimed to have disavowed after 2004 ) . And the second alleged that states \u201c may rationally conclude \u201d that \u201c it is better \u201d for parents to have a \u201c biological \u201d connection to their children .\nWhy does the Trump administration believe that someone who has done nothing but push fringe legal notions into the mainstream is fit to serve on a federal appellate bench ? It \u2019 s a puzzler . But unlike some of Trump \u2019 s nominees , VanDyke at least has legal experience on which he can be judged . He served as solicitor general of Montana and Nevada , in 2013\u201314 and from 2015\u201318 , respectively . While he served as Montana \u2019 s solicitor general , he spent much of his time working on amicus briefs filed in other states , giving us a clear sense of his ideology . Many of those briefs dealt with constitutional challenges to state and federal gun laws , abortion , and same-sex marriage . ( VanDyke has a knack for controversy : He also penned a discredited article arguing that \u201c intelligent design , \u201d a form of creationism , should be taught in public schools . He did it in this century ! )\nIn 2013 , VanDyke co-authored a brief in an abortion case seeking the wholesale reconsideration of Roe v. Wade . As the Las Vegas Sun editorialized this week about his extreme tendencies , \u201c VanDyke was so gung-ho about joining Montana into one politically charged case that he committed to it without even bothering to review the legal document at issue. \u201d The Sun went on to note that \u201c emails from Montana also showed that VanDyke worked hand-in-hand with the Federalist Society , the hugely powerful conservative legal organization , from which VanDyke asked for help while \u2018 having trouble coming up with any plausible ( much less good ) arguments \u2019 in a guns case. \u201d And while he served as Nevada \u2019 s solicitor general , VanDyke was not even admitted to the state bar , even after a temporary two-year waiver expired .\nBut Republican senators did not dig into most of this , nor did they probe VanDyke \u2019 s record of extreme and punitive anti-gay , anti-women , pro-gun advocacy on Wednesday . Rather , they took turns bashing the ABA for its scathing assessment . To discredit the group \u2019 s rating , Republicans drew from a playbook laid out by Mike Davis , a former clerk for Justice Neil Gorsuch who lobbies for Trump \u2019 s judicial nominees , on Twitter Tuesday night . Lee accused the ABA of having \u201c lost its credibility as a neutral arbiter \u201d and operating as a \u201c special interest group. \u201d He urged the White House \u201c to suspend the unique access that the American Bar Association has \u201d to nominees \u201c until such time as a thorough investigation and review is undertaken to inquire into \u201d its investigative methods . Hawley zeroed in on the fact that Marcia Davenport , the ABA \u2019 s chief evaluator of VanDyke , donated $ 150 to his opponent in a 2014 Montana Supreme Court race .\nLet \u2019 s stipulate that Davenport was not an ideal candidate to lead the ABA \u2019 s assessment of VanDyke . But let \u2019 s also remember that after Davenport filed her initial report , a full committee of 15 ABA members supported , by majority vote , the rating of \u201c not qualified. \u201d And that after this vote , the organization conducted a supplemental review and held a second vote , which led to the same result .
