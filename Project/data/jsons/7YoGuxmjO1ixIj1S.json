    "content": "There I was , watching college football and the Ryder Cup as my daughter sat next to me on the couch drawing Rapunzel and Ariel . Halftime of the game I was watching came so I moseyed over to my office to look in on the political world , expecting not much new at 5 o \u2019 clock on a Saturday . Didn \u2019 t see much at first . And then ... oh , what \u2019 s this ? Something about basement dwellers . And Hillary . Making fun of people living in basements ? What ? Oh Christ . Here we go again .\nBackstory : The Intercept , the ( I think it \u2019 s fair to say ) anti-Clinton-though-by-no-means-pro-Trump web site , got a tape of a talk Clinton gave at a private fundraiser in McLean , Virginia , back in February . No , check that . It looks like the Washington Free Beacon got it first and posted it Tuesday . But the conservative Beacon , reflecting house priorities , led with the fact that Clinton evidently said on the tape that she wouldn \u2019 t upgrade the nuclear arsenal , which for the Beacon indicates of course that she wants America to lose .\nAfter that I \u2019 m not certain what happened but it seems as if after the Beacon published the audio , a couple Intercept reporters were the first people on the left who got around to listening to it . The Intercept account , as you might guess , didn \u2019 t give a rat \u2019 s pooper about the nuclear arsenal but led with the fact that Clinton said , somewhat unfortunately\u2014but in context only somewhat , for reasons I \u2019 ll explain\u2014that she occupies the \u201c center-left to the center-right . \u201d\nThat was a responsible and , for the Intercept , predictable and understandable way to play the story . But then , by the time it got to the Twittersphere , Clinton was somehow making fun of Sanderistas , mocking them for being such losers that they \u2019 re living in their parent \u2019 s basements . The hashtag # basementdwellers was trending like mad when I checked in , and I \u2019 d imagine it \u2019 ll be going strong all night . I read a few of them , which boiled down to fuck you , Hillary , you corporate hack , this is why we need the revolution and you \u2019 re going to be the first to face the firing squad ( although I thought I smelled a lot of trolling from the deplorable caucus too ) .\nOf all the arrant bullshit I \u2019 ve seen on Twitter this election , this is easily the bullshittiest . She insulted no one . In fact quite the opposite\u2014for someone speaking behind closed doors to ardent supporters , she was not only restrained , but she openly and directly asked her supporters to be patient with the impatient ; that is , to understand the views and motivations of the younger people who wanted more radical change .\nThe Intercept quoted two passages . I \u2019 ve not listened to the tape yet , but we can presume that between them , the Beacon and the Intercept plucked out the interesting parts . So here \u2019 s what the Intercept came up with .\nIt is important to recognize what \u2019 s going on in this election . Everybody who \u2019 s ever been in an election that I \u2019 m aware of is quite bewildered because there is a strain of , on the one hand , the kind of populist , nationalist , xenophobic , discriminatory kind of approach that we hear too much of from the Republican candidates . And on the other side , there \u2019 s just a deep desire to believe that we can have free college , free healthcare , that what we \u2019 ve done hasn \u2019 t gone far enough , and that we just need to , you know , go as far as , you know , Scandinavia , whatever that means , and half the people don \u2019 t know what that means , but it \u2019 s something that they deeply feel . So as a friend of mine said the other day , I am occupying from the center-left to the center-right . And I don \u2019 t have much company there . Because it is difficult when you \u2019 re running to be president , and you understand how hard the job is\u2014I don \u2019 t want to overpromise . I don \u2019 t want to tell people things that I know we can not do .\nSome are new to politics completely . They \u2019 re children of the Great Recession . And they are living in their parents \u2019 basement . They feel they got their education and the jobs that are available to them are not at all what they envisioned for themselves . And they don \u2019 t see much of a future . I met with a group of young black millennials today and you know one of the young women said , \u201c You know , none of us feel that we have the job that we should have gotten out of college . And we don \u2019 t believe the job market is going to give us much of a chance. \u201d So that is a mindset that is really affecting their politics . And so if you \u2019 re feeling like you \u2019 re consigned to , you know , being a barista , or you know , some other job that doesn \u2019 t pay a lot , and doesn \u2019 t have some other ladder of opportunity attached to it , then the idea that maybe , just maybe , you could be part of a political revolution is pretty appealing . So I think we should all be really understanding of that and should try to do the best we can not to be , you know , a wet blanket on idealism . We want people to be idealistic . We want them to set big goals . But to take what we can achieve now and try to present them as bigger goals .\nAll right . Let \u2019 s parse them . In the first quote , the first sentence is just an opener , and the second critiques the Trump movement . The third sentence critiques the Sanders people , but there \u2019 s nothing condescending in it . Maybe that \u201c whatever that means \u201d after the mention of Scandinavia is a little dismissive . But really . Now we \u2019 re at the point where we \u2019 re not permitting people speaking in private the occasional verbal tic of the sort we all employ ?\nThen comes center-left and center-right . It \u2019 s the mention of \u201c center-right \u201d that the Intercept meant to rub in her face , and in a perfect world I \u2019 d rather she \u2019 d not said it . But it \u2019 s quite obvious that she is contrasting herself with the movements to her left and to her right\u2014the very two movements she had just described . So she was really just saying , I \u2019 m in between those two . And who knows\u2014there were probably Republicans in the room . It was McLean . She may have been trying to reassure them and get them to tell their friends , \u201c You know , we can live with her. \u201d No , that \u2019 s not pandering . It \u2019 s politics . If she weren \u2019 t chasing responsible Republican votes , she \u2019 d be an idiot .\nNow , the second and \u201c offending \u201d graf . How in the world these words can offend anyone is just absurd . OK , baristas . But I \u2019 m sure even most baristas have higher aspirations in life . But the main thing is that when she says \u201c they are living in their parents \u2019 basement , \u201d she \u2019 s obviously not making fun of them . She \u2019 s just describing them . Indeed , she is explaining to these rich people in one of America \u2019 s richest towns , hey , take a minute to understand where these folks are coming from . And she \u2019 s doing so the week after Sanders throttled her in New Hampshire\u2014a point in time when , if anything , she \u2019 d have been prone to lash out at them .\nThere \u2019 s nothing patronizing about any of this . I also saw a bunch of people on Twitter saying in effect for the life of me , I don \u2019 t see what the big deal is here . I retweeted a guy who said the # basementdwellers \u201c controversy \u201d is proof enough of the reason why she didn \u2019 t release her speech transcripts . Amen to that .\nSo why is this even a thing ? I think chiefly because it \u2019 s a hacked transcript . Hacked transcripts are the crack of Twitter . Who exactly ? \u201c Hackers who breached the email account of a campaign staffer , \u201d according to the Beacon . Country not specified .\nAnd because it \u2019 s Hillary . Hoo boy ! Hacked Hillary emails ! There must be something there ! So the transcript is scoured , and in fact it \u2019 s disappointing , but there \u2019 s something there , if read in negative and paranoid enough light .\nCORRECTION ( Saturday , Oct. 1 , 7:10 p.m. ) : Originally , this column said The Daily Caller first got the audio . It was , as corrected , the Washington Free Beacon . Also , the Beacon first published its story Tuesday , not Thursday , as this column originally said .",

People are such babies sometimes.\n\nCORRECTION (Saturday, Oct. 1, 7:10 p.m.): Originally, this column said The Daily Caller first got the audio. It was, as corrected, the Washington Free Beacon.
