What made this strike more newsworthy than most was its use of a GBU-43 bomb .\nThe Massive Ordnance Air Burst Bomb ( MOAB ) , known more colloquially as the \u201c mother of all bombs \u201d is the most powerful conventional bomb in the U.S. arsenal .\nThe commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan , General John Nicholson noted that \u201c this is the right munition to reduce these obstacles and maintain the momentum of our offensive against ISIS-K \u201d ( the Afghan branch of ISIS ) .\nThe MOAB was developed in 2002 , but had never been used in combat . Thus , the strike in Nangahar Province will inevitably spark speculation about what it all means . Does this represent an escalation of the Afghan war effort ? Is it another , extremely loud signal of seriousness from the Trump administration ? Was it a response to the death of Staff Sergeant Mark De Alencar , a Special Forces soldier who was killed April 8 in the same province ?\nMost likely the MOAB was used for a simple reason : it was the right bomb for the right target .\nMost likely , however , the MOAB was used for a far simpler reason : it was the right bomb for the right target .\nDespite some reports to the contrary , the destructive force of the MOAB is nowhere near that of a nuclear weapon . The MOAB has the force of 11 tons of TNT . For comparison , the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 had the force of 15 thousand tons of TNT .\nThe MOAB is designed to destroy surface targets in a contained environment such as a valley or a cave system . It does not have the capability to penetrate deeply into terrain and destroy a deeply buried target . It is , however , imminently well-suited to collapsing cave openings and killing combatants within the local area .\nNow , consider Thursday \u2019 s target . Nangahar Province is a deeply mountainous area , making normal military operations difficult . In 2001 , Usama bin Laden was believed to have taken refuge in caves in the Tora Bora region of the province . Back then , the U.S. used large BLU-82 15,000 lb . bombs , known as \u201c daisy cutters \u201d in an attempt to seal and deny the use of caves to bin Laden and his followers . The MOAB was not available then .\nThe MOAB contains a few thousand pounds more explosive than the BLU-82 daisy cutter . It also incorporates improvements in delivery , making it more precise than the daisy cutter .\nGiven the difficulty of military movement in the province , the MOAB is an excellent choice for reducing enemy infrastructure and forces in the area . For those reasons , the use of the MOAB probably represents neither an escalation nor a change in strategy or tactics by the Trump administration . It \u2019 s just the appropriate matching of ordnance to target .\nSome will try to link the use of the MOAB to the death of Staff Sergeant De Alencar .
