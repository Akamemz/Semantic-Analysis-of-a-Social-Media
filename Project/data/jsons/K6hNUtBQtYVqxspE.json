And that would quickly force other elected Republicans there to decide how tightly they want to embrace a candidate who , even with his victories in the primary , could prove repellent to the sort of up-for-grabs voters most coveted in these pre-eminent swing states . This calculation could also prove consequential in the Senate campaign , as both states have Republican-held seats at stake that could determine the balance of power in that chamber .\nEven as Ohio \u2019 s economy has recovered since the Great Recession , manufacturing jobs have continued to vanish . Should Mr. Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on the Democratic side win Ohio , it will be in part because of their ferocious assault on the United States \u2019 international trade agreements \u2014 a line of attack that also lifted them in Michigan . The economic conditions in the state have undermined support for free trade among voters and leaders in both parties . That augurs for a general election where the eventual party nominees will confront immense pressure to abandon the bipartisan free-trade consensus that has shaped every modern presidential administration .\nIllinois and Missouri have a lot in common ( besides being Midwestern states that share the Mississippi River ) . Both have been obscured by the action in Florida and Ohio , which are winner-take-all contests for Republicans and elimination races for Mr. Kasich and Mr. Rubio .\nBut Illinois and Missouri , which allocate a handful of delegates to the statewide winner and the rest to the top vote-getter in each of their congressional districts , could be just as important . If Mr. Trump overwhelms his competition in each , capturing every congressional district , he could effectively turn them into winner-take-all states .\nBut Mr. Kasich has aggressively campaigned in the Chicago area , and Mr. Cruz has stumped in nearly every corner of both the states .
