    "content": "Shock : Virginia Attorney General and presumptive gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli is trampling gay rights by trying to re-criminalize sexual behavior between consenting adults ! That was the shrill storyline on liberal blogs yesterday , touched off by a legal petition filed by Cuccinelli 's office over a court ruling on the state 's anti-sodomy laws . Unsurprisingly , the `` anti-gay '' frame is a total red herring . Cuccinelli 's narrow interest in the case lies in upholding a conviction of a 47-year-old man who solicited a sexual act from a 17-year-old girl . The Washington Post reports :\nVirginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli has challenged a recent court ruling finding Virginia \u2019 s anti-sodomy law unconstitutional . The appeal has gotten national attention as Cuccinelli \u2019 s gubernatorial bid ramps up . A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit ruled on March 12 that Virginia \u2019 s \u201c Crimes Against Nature \u201d statute , which banned oral and anal sex , violates the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . One judge dissented , agreeing with a lower court that the Supreme Court \u2019 s ruling in Lawrence v. Texas on sodomy laws applied only to consenting adults . The case in question involved a teenage girl and a 47-year-old man , William Scott MacDonald , who was convicted of soliciting a minor to commit a felony . A petition was filed on Cuccinelli \u2019 s behalf asking for the full 15-judge court to reconsider the panel \u2019 s decision . LGBT advocates have expressed disappointment , saying the law is unconstitutional and anti-gay . \u201c This case is not about sexual orientation , but using current law to protect a 17 year-old girl from a 47 year-old sexual predator , \u201d Cuccinelli spokeswoman Caroline Gibson said in a statement . \u201c We agree with the dissenting opinion that the petitioner was not entitled to federal habeas corpus relief and the full court should have the opportunity to decide this matter .

It 's about a case involving a man pushing 50 and a high school-aged girl . Oh , and the Attorney General 's office is siding with an Obama appointee 's ruling on the matter . Those facts aside , the McAuliffe campaign ripped Cuccinelli for playing `` divisive '' politics :\nCuccinelli is running for governor this year against former Democratic National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe , whose campaign picked up on the case . \u201c This is just another example of Ken Cuccinelli ignoring the economy and instead focusing on his divisive ideological agenda , \u201d McAuliffe spokesman Josh Schwerin said in a statement .\nYes , let 's talk about the economy . Virginia 's unemployment rate is 5.6 percent and the state enjoys a substantial budget surplus thanks to the stewardship of Virginia 's current governor , Bob McDonnell .

McAuliffe and Virginia Democrats hope voters will ignore McDonnell 's successful record of governance , which is why they 're eager to harp on the culture wars , even when there 's no basis for doing so . And the notion that Cuccinelli is `` focused '' on things like sodomy laws is absurd . Unlike McAuliffe , Cuccinelli has a day job other than full-time candidate .
