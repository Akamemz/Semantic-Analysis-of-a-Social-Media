Lindsey Graham of South Carolina looks like the only lawmaker in Congress trying to make a deal that would reopen the federal government .\nIn the Senate Friday night , in a desperate but ultimately failed attempt to avert a government shutdown , Graham was the main character .

As the clock neared midnight , Graham was surrounded by the better part of the Democratic caucus , making an impassioned plea to Schumer to prevent the shutdown .\nHe failed , of course . Senate Republicans and Democrats were reportedly coalescing around a deal to fund the government for three weeks \u2014 instead of the House plan \u2019 s four \u2014 and set up floor movement on immigration legislation to fix the issue of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program , which is the source of Democratic frustration and the minority \u2019 s willingness to shut down the government . It came up short , reportedly because House conservatives were unwilling to take up the plan that Graham had been negotiating with Democrats .\nBut on Saturday morning , Graham was still at it . He is pushing the proposal to fund the government through February 8 \u2014 a bill that McConnell is setting up a vote on \u2014 alongside a handshake deal for an open immigration debate before then .\n\u201c After my discussions with numerous senators on both sides of the last night it is clear to me a commitment to move to immigration after February 8th is the key to ending the government shutdown and finding resolution on all the outstanding issues , \u201d he said in a statement .\nBut Graham has one very big problem that might prevent him from the breakthrough he \u2019 s working so hard to find .\nGraham seems like the only person with a plan to open the government\nDemocrats and Republicans have been at an impasse for a week .
