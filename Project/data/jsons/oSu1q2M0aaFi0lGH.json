On numerous occasions we have asked the Department to keep us apprised of Fast and Furious weapon recoveries -- especially as they relate to violent crimes , '' Grassley wrote . `` Despite our repeated requests , it has been over a year since we last heard from the Department on this issue . The Department his from Congress this recent internal trace record showing a link between the murder of a police chief and Fast and Furious .
