    "content": "Earlier today , I talked with Libertarian Party presidential candidate Gary Johnson for about half an hour . Here 's an edited version of my conversation with the former two-term Republican governor of New Mexico . The topics we covered include whether he supports carbon taxes and mandatory vaccines ( no to both ) , agrees with Hillary Clinton 's characterization of Donald Trump as racist ( yes ) , and if he thinks there is any chance he will crack 15 percent in the national polls that will earn him a ticket to the presidential debates ( `` We 're very optimistic '' ) .\nJohnson , who ran for president on the LP ticket in 2012 and pulled more than 1 million votes , says that the response his campaign is getting this time around is a `` transformation . '' He attributes this to an `` appetite '' voters have for a different approach to politics , one that combines liberal social views and conservative fiscal views . He is certainly the only presidential candidate who believes `` taxes to me are like a death plague , '' blacks are systematically denied equal opportunities in America , minimum-wage laws punish low-skilled workers , and marijuana should be legalized .\n`` We are two former Republican governors who served in heavily Democratic states , '' Johnson told me while discussing the reaction to the way he and his running mate , former Massachusetts Gov . Bill Weld , mash-up positions normally associated with either the right or the left . `` What that meant is that we pissed everybody off , and because we pissed everybody off , we both got re-elected by bigger margins . We pissed off the left , we pissed off the right , but really where we came down was right in the middle . Where we came down on was right where everybody is , right where the majority of people are at . `` \u2014Nick Gillespie\nNICK GILLESPIE : Earlier this week , you suggested you were in favor of a carbon tax or fee . Yesterday , at a rally in New Hampshire ( video here ) , you said you were against it . What is your position on carbon taxes ?\nGARY JOHNSON : [ A carbon tax ] sounds good in theory , but it would n't work in practice . I never called it a tax . I called it a fee . As it was presented to me , this was the way to reduce carbon and actually reduce costs to reduce carbon . Under that premise\u2014lower costs , better outcomes\u2014you can always count on me to support that [ sort of ] notion . In theory it sounds good , but the reality is that it 's really complex and it wo n't really accomplish that . So , no support for a carbon fee . I never raised one penny of tax as governor of New Mexico , not one cent in any area . Taxes to me are like a death plague .\nGILLESPIE : You do believe that climate change is happening and that human activity adds to it . Does that mean it is an issue that should be addressed by government policy ?\nJOHNSON : Well , I 'll agree with the first two , but I 'm a skeptic that government policy can address this . The United States contributes 16 percent of the contribution of carbon in the world\u2026\nGILLESPIE : So you would be against the United States unilaterally making any kind of move that puts a huge economic disadvantage that also would n't really mitigate carbon ?\nJOHNSON : If there is any way we can address this issue without the loss of U.S. jobs , my ears are open .\nGILLESPIE : Let 's talk about vaccines . There are no federal laws mandating vaccines , and that 's how it should be , as far as you 're concerned .\nGILLESPIE : Various states treat vaccines differently , and you 're not wild about the range of individual choice and opt-out provisions , but you do believe it 's a state-level decision\u2014or certainly that it 's not a federal-level decision .\nGILLESPIE : There are people who say vaccines cause autism [ and other problems ] or that vaccines do n't work . Are you in that camp ?\nJOHNSON : No , I chose to have my children vaccinated . I understand all the concerns that some people have , but for me personally , I made a decision to have my children vaccinated . I want people to make decisions and I believe in [ opt-outs ] . With the exception of a few states , everyone has an opt-out . But I also want to say that , as president of the United States , if I am confronted with a zombie apocalypse that will happen unless the total herd is totally immunized , I will support [ mandatory vaccinations ] .\nGILLESPIE : Yesterday , Hillary Clinton gave a speech in which she explicitly said that Donald Trump was racist and that he has brought a racist presence into the Republican Party . A year ago , you told \u2588\u2588\u2588 something very similar . You said Trump 's comments about Mexicans and his views on immigration were racist . Do you agree with Hillary Clinton that Donald Trump is a racist ?\nJOHNSON : Well , if it walks like a duck , if it talks like a duck , it 's a duck .\nGILLESPIE : As a former Republican governor , how does that make you feel about the current state of the GOP ?\nJOHNSON : It makes me feel like I think more than half of Republicans feel : This is not representative of Republicans .\nGILLESPIE : Do you think the Republican Party is going to be permanently damaged by Donald Trump 's candidacy ?\nGILLESPIE : What do you think of his recent appeals to black voters ? He 's been saying to African Americans that the Democratic Party has n't really helped them much . That everything in their lives has gotten worse under Barack Obama and that Hillary Clinton is not their champion . Do you agree with Trump that Democratic Party policies have n't really benefited the black community ?\nJOHNSON : I do . Both parties are engaged in pandering . The libertarian approach\u2014equal opportunity\u2014is n't that what you really want ? But I 'd argue that equal opportunity currently does not exist .\nGILLESPIE : How does it not exist , and what policies would you enact to make it a reality ? Is it a question of ending a drug war that disproportionately impacts blacks , promoting school choice so they can escape chronically bad schools , and ending minimum-wage laws that price low-skilled workers out of getting their first jobs ?\nJOHNSON : All of what you just mentioned . Let me offer up a story . I was on Fox News ' The Five a couple of days ago with Eric Bolling . I made the statement that `` black lives matter '' and Eric chimed in to say , `` All lives matter . '' It 's not a criticism of him , it 's just indicative of the conversation [ about race and politics ] . I said , `` Yes , all lives do matter , but blacks are getting shot at the rate of six times that whites are . If you 're of color and you 're arrested , there 's a four times greater likelihood that you 'll go to jail than if you 're white . Eric said , `` Blacks commit eight times the crime . '' My answer was little muddied , but I think I got to my point . Yes , blacks are being arrested , they are being charged , and they are being convicted at eight times the rate of whites . If that same scrutiny were applied to you and I as whites , we would have those same results . That 's the awareness [ of unequal treatment ] that does n't currently exist .\nGILLESPIE : The set of ideas , mind-sets , and positions that your campaign is putting out there does n't have a home in contemporary Republican and Democratic politics . The way things are is that if you 're against the minimum wage because you think it hurts unskilled workers , you 've got to be a conservative . But then you 're saying , `` I care about blacks and they are having a tougher time in America than whites . '' So then you must be on the left . Do you feel the framework you and Bill Weld are presenting is getting through ? Is it changing the way people think about politics ?\nJOHNSON : I think we 're getting through in a huge way . Between Facebook , Twitter , and other social media , we 've got a reach of 300 million . We had a rally the other night in Vermont , and there was a crowd of 300 or 400 people , very enthusiastic people . Our Facebook Live stream of the rally got 300,000 views on Facebook Live in two hours . 300,000 ! Clearly there 's an appetite for what we 're talking about . Bill Weld says this all the time : We are two former Republican governors who served in heavily Democratic states . What that meant is that we pissed everybody off , and because we pissed everybody off , we both got re-elected by bigger margins . We pissed off the left , we pissed off the right , but really where we came down was right in the middle . Where we came down on was right where everybody is , right where the majority of people are at .\nGILLESPIE : A writer at the conservative website The Federalist recently said that your embrace of a carbon tax clearly meant you are `` a left-wing candidate . '' Do you consider yourself a left-winger ?\nJOHNSON : Well , no . But you know , tomorrow you will see an article that says this guy is a right-wing radical . Bravo .\nGILLESPIE : Let 's talk about your stance on religious-liberty issues , which has angered a lot people on the right and many libertarians . Your position is that you essentially want to extend anti-discrimination protections for race and gender to cover sexual orientation when it comes to businesses that are open to the public . Yet you support an opt-out for vaccinations . Why not support an opt-out for the religious owner of a business who does n't want to bake a gay Nazi wedding cake ?\nJOHNSON : Because it would create a new exemption for discrimination . At the end of the day we 're just going to agree to disagree . But you bring me specific legislation dealing with a cake baker not having to decorate a cake for a Nazi and I 'll sign it .\nGILLESPIE : Let 's talk about Hillary Clinton . In response to being called a bigot and a racist by her , Donald Trump said that she was fundamentally not trustworthy . Do you agree with him on that ?\nGILLESPIE : So you 're in a weird position , are n't you ? You actually agree with both Hillary and Donald , but you do n't think either should be president .\nJOHNSON : I agree . I had always surmised that Bill Clinton 's speaking fees\u2014which had n't been highly publicized over the years\u2014were tied to payoffs for what he had done as president . I 've always felt that , OK , this is the way of paying him back . What I 've come to discover is that it was also access to Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State that was being sold . It 's pay-to-play , textbook pay-to-play . That 's not right . Having never held political office before [ becoming governor ] , I had no idea of what was possible [ in terms of selling access and favors ] . For me , it had everything to do with doing the right thing . For me , it had everything to do with analyzing legislation\u2014would this actually improve lives or would it not ? If it did n't , I was going to veto it . If it was going to make things better , even incrementally , I signed on to it .\nGILLESPIE : Do you have a particular instance that you can point to with Hillary Clinton where she accepted a donation to the Clinton Foundation in regard to this action or this access ?\nJOHNSON : View the documentary that 's online right now : Clinton Cash . The preponderance of what they break down [ in the film ] clearly shows to me that this was an ongoing activity .\nGILLESPIE : You still have a lot of ground to cover to reach 15 percent in the national polls that will get you into the presidential debates . What do you think your odds are at this point ?\nJOHNSON : We 're very optimistic . Our reach on social media is doubling every three weeks right now . That simply means that for the first time people are hearing the name Gary Johnson . In the five polls [ being used by the Commission on Presidential Debates ] , we 're smack dab at 10 percent . Not 10.1 percent , not 9 percent , but smack dab at 10 percent . And if you look at those polls six weeks ago , the average would have probably been between 6 percent and 7 percent . Currently , we 're on the ballot in 45 states and we have 100 percent belief that we 'll be on the ballot in all the states and [ the District in Columbia ] . This campaign is really a transformation . We showed up in New Hampshire the other day to a big crowd . I ran in the 2012 cycle , and I think I got more media at that event than I got in the entire 2012 cycle . Everything is changed right now from an attention standpoint . Whether or not that means we end up in the debates and getting to make a difference on the stage is still a question . But right now ? I 'm as optimistic as ever .",
