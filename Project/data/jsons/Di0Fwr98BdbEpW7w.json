But the dramatic predictions about long lines at airports and the loss of special education funding involve some large assumptions.\n\n( PHOTOS: What they\u2019re saying about sequestration)\n\nHere is POLITICO\u2019s guide to evaluating the warnings in the White House sequester reports.\n\nThey\u2019re never going to fix the sequester?\n\nThe state-by-state reports are full of scary numbers about funding cuts for schools, defense, public health, law enforcement and social services \u2014 any of which could be true if Congress and Obama fail to act this week, next month \u2014 or ever.\n\nSo the scenarios described by Obama \u2014 \u201cthousands of teachers and educators will be laid off\u201d or \u201chundreds of thousands of Americans will lose access to primary care and preventive care like flu vaccinations and cancer screenings\u201d \u2014 are the worst-case scenario.\n\nEven Washington skeptics expect the sequester to soften eventually, even if the cuts take effect.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: What is sequestration?)\n\nOn Monday morning, for example, POLITICO Playbook broke news that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker John Boehner may retroactively give agencies wiggle room in a spending bill due at the end of March, which could make cuts to important programs potentially easier to handle.\n\nSo while Obama\u2019s numbers add up under the current stalemate, the picture could improve if a deal is reached \u2014 even after the fact.\n\nThey really do have some time\n\nSome of the most dire White House predictions are about education funding \u2014 like the deep cuts in aid for disadvantaged kids that could hurt 2,700 schools and 1.2 million students. And states could face the loss of federal special-education funding for 7,200 teachers and staff members who teach children with disabilities, according to the reports.\n\nThere\u2019s just one thing the White House doesn\u2019t mention: Those cuts wouldn\u2019t actually kick in until the next school year.\n\n( WATCH: Obama calls for governing on sequester)\n\nThat\u2019s because those two programs \u2014 Title I aid to disadvantaged students and special-education aid under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \u2014 are funded in advance, so they\u2019re already covered for this school year.\n\nAs Education Secretary Arne Duncan pointed out in a letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee earlier this month, \u201cthe hardship will be concentrated in the 2013-2014 school year\u201d because of the way the programs are funded.\n\nSchool districts won\u2019t be able to wait that long to plan for the possible cuts \u2014 Duncan\u2019s letter says they\u2019ll have to start making teacher hiring decisions in April and May.\n\nBut it does buy Obama and Congress at least a bit of time to negotiate a deal that could prevent the cuts.\n\nA Department of Education official noted that \u201cthe forward funding doesn\u2019t mitigate the impact of the sequester cuts, it just delays it on the calendar\u201d \u2014 but added that the school districts do need to start planning ahead.\n\n\"It just means a lot more children will not get the kinds of services they need, and as many as 40,000 teachers could lose their jobs,\u201d Duncan said Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d\n\nAnd there are other education cuts that will kick in sooner.
