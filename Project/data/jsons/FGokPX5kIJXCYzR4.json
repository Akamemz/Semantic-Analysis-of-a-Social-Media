    "content": "President Trump said Tuesday that he misspoke when he seemed to dismiss allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 elections , stating clearly that he accepts the U.S. intelligence community 's conclusions as he sought to quell a bipartisan firestorm over his press conference with Vladimir Putin .\nThe president clarified his remarks during a meeting with lawmakers at the White House , in a rare backtrack .\nIn Helsinki a day earlier , Trump had said he does n't `` see any reason why '' Russia would be behind election meddling . This and other comments led to bipartisan outrage and accusations that he was taking Putin 's word over the intelligence community 's .\nBut Trump said Tuesday he meant the opposite . He suggested he was surprised by the negative reaction when he returned to Washington .\n`` I came back and said 'What is going on , what \u2019 s the big deal ? ' \u201d Trump said , adding that he reviewed the transcript and `` realized that there is a need for some clarification . ''\nThe president told reporters that he meant to say he does n't see why Russia `` would n't '' be responsible .\n\u201c I said the word 'would ' instead of 'would n't ' ... sort of a double negative , '' he said .\nIt 's unclear whether the clarification will calm the backlash in Washington , as Trump also said following his meeting with Putin that the Russian leader gave a `` strong and powerful '' denial . Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer , D-N.Y. , kept up his criticism Tuesday afternoon , tweeting : `` President Trump tried to squirm away from what he said yesterday . It \u2019 s twenty-four hours too late , and in the wrong place . ''\nBut Trump sought to make clear Tuesday that he stands behind the intelligence community .\n`` I accept our intelligence community 's conclusion that Russia \u2019 s meddling in the 2016 election took place , '' he said , adding : `` It could be other people also . ''\nTrump 's comments came after even his allies urged him to clean up the press conference statements from Finland . Until now , Trump had battled his critics via Twitter while defending his trip abroad .\nTrump tweeted earlier Tuesday that his earlier NATO meeting , where he pressed allies to commit more in defense spending , as well as the Putin summit were a success . Further , he argued his actions at NATO would be bad for Russia .\n\u201c I had a great meeting with NATO . They have paid $ 33 Billion more and will pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars more in the future , only because of me . NATO was weak , but now it is strong again ( bad for Russia ) . The media only says I was rude to leaders , never mentions the money ! \u201d Trump tweeted on Tuesday .\nHe added , moments later , that his meeting with Putin was \u201c even better . \u201d\n\u201c While I had a great meeting with NATO , raising vast amounts of money , I had an even better meeting with Vladimir Putin of Russia . Sadly , it is not being reported that way\u2014the Fake News is going Crazy ! \u201d\nTrump continued to defend the meetings themselves while speaking to lawmakers at the White House , touting them as a success .\n`` We are going to have peace , that 's what we want , and that 's what we 're going to have . I say peace through strength , '' Trump said of his talks with NATO allies , noting that the talks brought a `` great spirit that we did n't have before . ''\nTrump also defended his meeting with Putin , saying he entered with a strategy of `` diplomacy '' and `` engagement , '' which is `` better than hostility . ''\nTrump said he was in a position of `` strength '' in the meeting .\n`` Our economy is booming , and our military ... it will be more powerful of a military than we 've ever had before , '' Trump said , noting the range of topics he and Putin discussed included Syria , Iran , nuclear proliferation , North Korea and Israel .\n`` I think the meeting I had with President Putin was really strong . I think they were willing to do things , frankly I thought they would n't be willing to do , '' Trump said . `` It was a very , very good meeting . ''\nTrump had angered members of both parties , though , by saying both countries are to blame for damaged U.S.-Russian relations , and letting Putin deny election meddling unchallenged .\nHouse Minority Whip Steny Hoyer , D-Md. , said earlier Tuesday that Trump 's remarks were `` nothing short of treason , '' echoing comments from Obama CIA boss John Brennan . He brushed off pressure from the party \u2019 s left flank to pursue impeachment , calling the issue a \u201c distraction \u201d \u2013 but kept the door open for some kind of future rebuke , saying there will be time to address such issues \u201c once we take control of the House back . \u201d\n\u201c Russia did meddle with our elections , \u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan , R-Wis. , told reporters on Capitol Hill Tuesday , while urging the U.S. to aid other democracies around the world in protecting their election systems . \u201c We know that they interfered , and we have passed sanctions\u2026to make sure they don \u2019 t interfere again . \u201d\nRyan suggested that the U.S. \u201c will face this Russian aggression again . \u201d\nWhen asked whether he thought Trump was treasonous , he responded : \u201c I do not . \u201d\nRyan did say , however , that Special Counsel Robert Mueller \u201c should be allowed to carry out his work \u201d in investigating Russian meddling and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates during the 2016 presidential election .\nOn the Senate side , Republicans are discussing a new measure to back the intelligence community \u2019 s findings that Russia meddled in the 2016 election . So far , a similar measure has not been introduced or discussed in the House .\n\u201c I do think that the findings ... during the end of the Obama administration provides a road map to what the Russians did , as do the indictment of the 12 Russian GRU intelligence officials .
