    "content": "Hillary Clinton has managed to win support from Republicans without conceding any part of the progressive economic agenda she outlined during the Democratic primary .\nBut with fall approaching and momentum on Clinton \u2019 s side , Democrats and Republicans alike are looking over the horizon to a thornier reality : If elected , Clinton would likely become the first Democrat since Grover Cleveland to enter office without control of both houses of Congress .\nThat means the bipartisan show of support she has now \u2014 thanks to Donald Trump and the \u201c alt-right , \u201d conspiracy-driven campaign Clinton attacked Thursday in Reno , Nevada \u2014 is likely to evaporate as soon as the race is called . If she wins the presidency , Clinton would likely enjoy the shortest honeymoon period of any incoming commander in chief in recent history , according to Washington strategists , confronting major roadblocks to enacting her ambitious agenda , as well as Republican attacks that have been muted courtesy of the GOP nominee .\n\u201c It will be the defining fact of her presidency , \u201d Jonathan Cowan , president of the moderate think tank Third Way , said of Clinton 's problem of entering office with a divided Congress . \u201c It \u2019 s unprecedented . ''\nPresident Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton both enjoyed at least two years of a Democratic majority in Congress when they entered the White House , a period during which they were able to enact major portions of their agendas .\nWhile Democrats are confident about taking control of the Senate if Clinton wins the election , even her top operatives who have been working to elect down-ballot Democrats do not expect to snatch up the House of Representatives .\n\u201c What that would leave her with is an absolute imperative to govern from the center , '' said Cowan , a former Bill Clinton White House official . `` She will have no choice .
