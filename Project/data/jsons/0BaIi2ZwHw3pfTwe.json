And so the question here tonight is not where we \u2019 ve been , but where we \u2019 re going , \u201d he said . \u201c Governor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes , skewed towards the wealthy , and roll back regulations , that we \u2019 ll be better off . \u201d\nLike challengers before him , Mr. Romney benefitted from being on the same stage as the president in the 90-minute sparring match , broadcast to a national audience , that underscored the deep policy differences between the two men \u2014 probably the biggest divide between presidential candidates in a generation .\nUnlike Mr. Obama , who said he wanted to look forward , Mr. Romney repeatedly pointed back to the last four years , laying a devastating litany of failures on Mr. Obama \u2019 s doorstep .\n\u201c What we \u2019 re seeing right now is a trickle-down government approach which has government thinking it can do a better job than people pursuing their dreams . It \u2019 s not working , \u201d he said . \u201c And the proof of that is 23 million people out of work . The proof of that is one out of six people in poverty . The proof of that is we \u2019 ve gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps . The proof of that is 50 percent of college graduates this year can \u2019 t find work .

It \u2019 s time for a new path . \u201d\nThe early reviews were far kinder to Mr. Romney than to the president .\n\u201c It looked like Romney wanted to be there , and Obama looked like he didn \u2019 t want to be there , \u201d James Carville , a Democratic strategist who advised President Clinton , said on CNN .\nAnd a CNN flash poll of registered voters who watched the debate found 67 percent thought Mr. Romney won to 25 percent for Mr. Obama .\nA separate CBS poll of undecided voters also give Mr. Romney \u2019 s performance a decisive edge , 46 percent to 22 percent , with the rest saying it was a tie .\nThe Republican had the bigger challenge coming in . He trails in the polls , and voters say they don \u2019 t know as much about him and find him less likable than Mr. Obama .\nWith that context , Mr. Romney labored to portray himself as the defender of the middle class , and to overcome the video released last month that showed him telling wealthy donors that 47 percent of Americans are \u201c victims \u201d receiving government benefits .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t have a $ 5 trillion tax cut . I don \u2019 t have a tax cut of a scale that you \u2019 re talking about , \u201d he told the president . \u201c My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class . But I \u2019 m not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people . High-income people are doing just fine in this economy .
