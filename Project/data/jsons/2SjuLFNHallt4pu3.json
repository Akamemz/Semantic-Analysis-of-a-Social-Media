We are once again facing a crisis , though this time a global one\u2014fitting for our cosmopolitan era .

While John F. Kennedy was not the first president to be assassinated in office , the effect of his presence on television in the American psyche should not go overlooked when considering the country \u2019 s response to his murder . Though President Eisenhower had previously held a press conference that was filmed and later televised , President Kennedy was the first to address the nation on live television without delay or editing , and many consider the televised Kennedy-Nixon debates to be the key turning point of his 1960 campaign . The medium allowed him to enter the homes of thousands of families in not just sound but in moving image , penetrating the nation \u2019 s consciousness in a manner even Roosevelt in his famed Fireside Chats could not hope to achieve . What bitter tragedy that it would be for the same reason that he became such a part of Americans \u2019 identities that would then make it possible for them to watch , frame-by-frame , his heartbreaking end . But on television they could watch , too , the remarkable state funeral that channeled their grief to a single focal point\u2014solemn and dignified , and set against the backdrop of the nation \u2019 s capital\u2014and achieve the catharsis necessary to begin healing their shaken spirits .\nAs some Americans are quarantined and many more practice social distancing in the coming weeks and months , we are sure to experience uncertainty , restlessness , and significant human tragedy as COVID-19 spreads across the country and wreaks havoc on the global economy . The source of our suffering is invisible to the eye and ubiquitous ; there is no established ritual to assist us in channeling our fear and despair , no single body that may be laid to rest as there was in the case of President Kennedy . We have not even a mater dolorosa to preside over our despair , as we did then with the dowager first lady . Without a clear vision of the future and so much at stake , we face not only the physical threats of the coronavirus but also that of an epidemic of hopelessness\u2014one even greater than that which already existed in many parts of our nation .\nWhen I first began mulling the potential role of mythos in this pandemic , I wondered briefly if film and television show production would shut down . Logically , it made sense\u2014but was somehow unthinkable . Yet here we are , with a much larger crisis than the Kennedy assassination and yet deprived of nearly every medium to shape and coalesce what might be called the nation \u2019 s \u201c macro-mythos \u201d : public gatherings , the formal rituals of grief , the high-production-value depictions of unifying narrative stories in movies and on TV . Across social media , however\u2014between the latest bleak , breaking news , partisan finger-pointing , absurdist memes , and personal statements of loved ones suffering or lost to the virus\u2014there are stories of people around the world stepping up to contribute their time , resources , and skills to fight COVID-19 . Heroic doctors , nurses , and other healthcare professionals in every state risk their own well-being to attend the bodies of the afflicted . Policymakers and civil society leaders across America are working tirelessly to soothe the nation \u2019 s economic concerns , and volunteers , innovators , and heads of industry are mobilizing to meet the material demands necessary for fighting the novel coronavirus .\nEven if we are not particularly well-positioned to contribute to this war effort , our duty as individuals must then be to have courage and faith , to contribute to the \u201c micro-mythos \u201d through consoling and giving strength to those around us . \u201c Reflecting today on Jackie \u2019 s stoical management of self and surroundings in the aftermath of the assasination , we may rue the disrespect with which my Romantic Sixties generation treated the artifice of etiquette , \u201d writes Paglia . \u201c Jackie \u2019 s classy grace under pressure , her cool rejection of complaint or self-pity demonstrate the redemption possible in repression , sublimation , and silence. \u201d It \u2019 s natural to feel anxiety , distress , and sadness in the face of disaster\u2014but through self-discipline and restraint we can give meaning to our own suffering , and do our part to prevent each new tragedy from becoming a fresh hell by choosing instead to focus on supporting others .\n[ Read \u201c Why Demonic Forces Are the Best We Can Hope for \u201d ]\nEventually film studios will reopen , and the stories of these times will be told in technicolor .

You will be affected by this horrific beginning no differently than travelers are by a steep and rugged mountain , for beyond it there lies a most beautiful and delightful plain , which will supply them with pleasure that matches the difficulty of both their ascent and descent .
