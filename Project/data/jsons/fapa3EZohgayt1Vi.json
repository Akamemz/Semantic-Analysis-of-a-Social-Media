They include a review of the clean power plan , which restricts greenhouse gas emissions at coal-fired power plants .\nTrump , who has called global warming a \u201c hoax \u201d , has criticised the power-plant rule and others as placing an unnecessary burden on American workers and the struggling US coal industry .\nThe official acknowledged the orders \u2019 effects would not be immediate , especially in view of legal challenges . \u201c I would bet a good deal I \u2019 m sure there \u2019 ll be litigation \u2026 Whether that \u2019 s three years , two years or one year , I don \u2019 t know . It \u2019 s going to take some time . \u201d\nThe US agreed to cut its greenhouse gas emissions 26-28 % by 2025 compared with 2005 levels under the Paris agreement . Obama \u2019 s clean power plan is the chief policy designed to lower US emissions . In 2015 it was billed as the strongest action ever on climate change by a US president but criticised for targeting coal-fired power plants .\nRichard Lazarus , an environmental law expert at Harvard University , said : \u201c It was launched before Paris for a reason . Everyone knew if the United States didn \u2019 t make a serious commitment , Paris wouldn \u2019 t happen . It \u2019 s now an open question how the rest of the world is going to respond if the United States eliminates a linchpin of its commitment . \u201d\nTrump will also aim to wipe out Obama \u2019 s climate action plan , the 2013 directive outlining the government \u2019 s response to climate change . His orders will lift a 14-month-old moratorium on new coal leases on federal lands , while a major hydraulic fracturing ( fracking ) regulation will be reviewed .\nGuidelines published by the White House Council on Environmental Quality last August will be rescinded . Estimates of the social costs of carbon and other greenhouses gases will be overturned because they were not put out in \u201c a transparent fashion \u201d , the White House official said .\nAides insisted the official speak without being named , despite Trump \u2019 s past criticism of the use of unnamed sources . The official said the measures were aimed at achieving the goal of energy independence . \u201c We want to take our own course and do it in our own fashion . \u201d\nClimate change is \u201c an issue that deserves attention but again I think the president \u2019 s been very clear he \u2019 s not going to pursue a climate or environmental policies that put the US economy at risk \u201d , he said . \u201c It \u2019 s very simple . \u201d\nTrump and his allies , including Scott Pruitt of the Environmental Protection Agency , have previously criticised the 2016 Paris climate accord involving nearly 200 countries . The official said on Monday : \u201c In terms of the Paris agreement , whether we stay in or not is still under discussion . \u201d\nAsked what message he wanted to send to major carbon producers such as China and India , the official said : \u201c I think the United States is going to pursue its interests as it sees fit . I think the president \u2019 s been very clear about having an America-first energy policy . We have a lot of energy in this country and the president wants to continue to remove any obstacles so we can produce . \u201d\nThe official was pressed by reporters on how climate change should be tackled . He said : \u201c One , you \u2019 ve got to make sure you have a strong economy . You \u2019 ve got to make sure you have people who are actually working .

The more prosperous the economies \u2026 if you compare the United States to other economies , we have a cleaner , healthier environment than other countries that don \u2019 t . I mean , look at China . \u201d\nThe official insisted : \u201c The previous administration devalued workers by their policies . We \u2019 re saying we can do both : we can protect the environment and provide people with work and keep the economy going and that \u2019 s the policy agenda we \u2019 re going to focus on . \u201d\nThe 2015 clean power plan has been on hold since 2016 while a federal appeals court considers a challenge by coal-friendly states and more than 100 companies . The attempt to roll it back completely will meet with fierce opposition .\nTom\u00e1s Carbonell , director of regulatory policy and senior attorney at the Environmental Defense Fund , said the White House must adhere to the same process of public notice and comment that was followed in adopting the plan , which took almost two years .\n\u201c Large majorities of Americans in red and blue states alike support strong action to reduce carbon pollution from the nation \u2019 s power plants , and the clean power plan is supported by a broad and diverse coalition of states , municipalities , power companies , leading businesses , consumer advocates , faith organizations and many others , \u201d he said .\n\u201c These supporters will turn out in force to oppose the administration \u2019 s outrageous attack on the United States \u2019 only nationwide limits on carbon pollution from power plants \u2013 safeguards that are essential to protecting our public health , securing a clean energy economy and yielding a safer climate for our children . \u201d\nTravis Nichols , a spokesman for Greenpeace , said : \u201c This proposed executive order gives us further proof that Trump isn \u2019 t a leader , he \u2019 s just a fossil fuel industry stooge with a presidential pen . Thankfully , for all his bluster , the best Trump can do is delay America \u2019 s inevitable transition to clean energy , but he can \u2019 t stop it .\n\u201c The problem , of course , is how much devastation his administration will inflict on the climate , vulnerable communities and the environment in the meantime . With this proposed executive order the Trump administration is simply putting America further behind in the global race towards a renewable future . \u201d\nThe American Sustainable Business Council said : \u201c Businesses want action that addresses climate change . They know that rolling back the clean power plan without a meaningful alternative in its place , like a carbon fee , will make climate change worse . That will further hurt economic growth .\n\u201c The business community is looking for real leadership on climate change , and so far all we \u2019 ve seen are decisions from the polluters \u2019 playbook . \u201d\nTrump has promised to revitalise the coal industry .
