He had just announced as much to a crowd in Ohio . The assembled military and national security advisers told him the move was rash and unwise . So he gave them six months .\nEight months later , planning for the withdrawal is now underway -- against the advice of those same officials , who warned in April that Russia and Iran would gain stronger footholds in Syria when the US presence there evaporates .\nOn Capitol Hill , even some of Trump 's GOP allies were warning of a grave mistake .\n`` My sense is that it 's been a shock through the administration that this was made , '' Senate Foreign Relations chairman Bob Corker told reporters on Wednesday after returning from the White House , where he had traveled to meet with Trump but was told as he waited the meeting was canceled .\n`` It 's hard to imagine that any president would wake up and make this kind of decision with this little communication , with this little preparation , '' Corker said . `` I mean , my understanding is that we 're beginning to move out right now . ''\nHurried discussions continued Wednesday about the timing and pace of the troop withdrawal , which the White House said has already begun . The announcement lacked the formality of previous presidents ' declarations they would remove troops from war zones : the White House did not schedule any presidential remarks nor provide any concrete details of the decision .\nTrump issued his first public comments on the decision Wednesday evening in a video message posted to Twitter , in which he pointed to the sky to reference US military personnel who have been killed in Syria .\n`` We have won against ISIS , '' Trump said . `` We 've beaten them and we 've beaten them badly . We 've taken back the land and now it 's time for our troops to come back home . I get very saddened when I have to write letters or call parents or wives or husbands of soldiers who have been killed fighting for our country . ''\nHe added later , `` So our boys , our young women , our men , they 're all coming back and they 're coming back now . We won , and that 's the way we want it .
