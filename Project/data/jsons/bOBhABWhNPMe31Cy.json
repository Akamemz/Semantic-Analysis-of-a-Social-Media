( Photo by Amarjeet Kumar Singh / SOPA Images/Sipa USA ) \u00a9 Sipa via AP Images\n( New York ) \u2013 Indian authorities should immediately drop politically-motivated charges against those peacefully protesting against citizenship policies that discriminate against Muslims and release them from custody , \u2588\u2588\u2588 said today .\nPolice have used draconian anti-terrorism , sedition , and other laws against students , activists , and other government critics , but have not acted against violence by supporters of the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) . In some cases , the police filed new charges after activists were granted bail to ensure that they remained in custody , placing them at further risk during the Covid-19 outbreak in overcrowded prisons with inadequate sanitation , hygiene , and access to medical care .\n\u201c The Indian authorities have used the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown to arrest activists , silence dissent , and deter future protests against discriminatory policies , \u201d said Meenakshi Ganguly , South Asia director at \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c Instead of addressing past police abuse , the authorities seem to be trying their best to add to the list . \u201d\nIn December 2019 , the BJP-led government adopted the Citizenship Amendment Act , which for the first time in India makes religion a basis for citizenship . In response , protests broke out throughout the country following fears that the act , together with a planned nationwide verification process to identify \u201c illegal migrants , \u201d could threaten the citizenship rights of millions of Indian Muslims .\nViolence around the protests broke out in Delhi on February 24 , 2020 , leaving at least 53 people dead and hundreds injured , most of them Muslim . The police failed to respond adequately and were at times complicit in these attacks . The authorities have failed to conduct impartial and transparent investigations into the violence .\nWhile peaceful protests were dispersed after the government announced a lockdown in March 2020 to contain the spread of Covid-19 , the authorities have since started arresting protesters , including students and activists , and filing charges of sedition , murder , and terrorism under the Unlawful Activities ( Prevention ) Act ( UAPA ) , accusing them of a \u201c conspiracy \u201d to \u201c defame the country in the international arena . \u201d\nThose arrested include Meeran Haider , Safoora Zargar , Asif Iqbal Tanha , and Gulfisha Fatima , student activists ; Shifa-Ur-Rehman and Khalid Saifi , activists ; Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal , student activists from the feminist collective Pinjra Tod ; Tahir Hussain , a local political leader from Aam Aadmi Party ; and Ishrat Jahan , local leader from the opposition Congress party .\nZargar , arrested on April 10 for rioting , was granted bail three days later . But that day the police booked her under the UAPA and for murder and sedition . She was denied bail on those charges despite her being in the second trimester of pregnancy and having an underlying medical condition , two factors that could place her at heightened risk of complications if she were to contract Covid-19 .\nKalita and Narwal were granted bail after being arrested for rioting . In Kalita \u2019 s case , the magistrate noted that the police could not produce any concrete evidence to prove her role in the violence . However , the Delhi police immediately booked them on other charges , including sedition , murder , and under the UAPA , and they remain in jail .\nViolence broke out in Delhi on February 24 , soon after a local BJP politician , Kapil Mishra , demanded that the police clear the roads of protesters . Tensions had been building for weeks , with BJP leaders openly advocating violence against the protesters , portraying anyone who spoke out against the government as working against the country \u2019 s interests .\nClashes between BJP supporters and citizenship law protesters soon transformed into Hindu mobs rampaging through northeast Delhi , killing Muslims and damaging their homes , shops , mosques , and property . While several Hindus were also killed , including a policeman and a government official , Muslims overwhelmingly bore the brunt of the violence .\nActivists fear the police have overwhelmingly arrested Muslim residents from northeast Delhi neighborhoods where the violence took place in February , some of them victims of attacks , while failing to act against those responsible for the mob violence . The Delhi police have denied these allegations , saying the number of people arrested from the two communities are \u201c almost identical to each other , \u201d but have failed to disclose arrest details . The authorities have even provided contradictory information . In March , Home Minister Amit Shah told parliament that the violence was a \u201c well-planned conspiracy \u201d and that the police had filed over 700 cases , and detained 2,647 people . In a media briefing a day later , the Delhi police said that 200 people had been arrested . A month later , in reply to a Right to Information request , the Delhi police claimed that 48 people had been arrested . In May , a police spokesperson said that more than 1,300 people had been arrested in over 750 cases .\nIn several cases , \u2588\u2588\u2588 found that the police did not follow procedures established under the criminal code such as producing an arrest warrant , informing the person \u2019 s family of the arrest , and providing them a copy of the First Information Report , the official police case , or ensuring that those arrested have access to legal counsel , including during interrogation .\nA lawyer reported that his 45-year-old client was accused of looting and burning a shop as part of a mob . On April 2 , when the man and his wife were not at home , several policemen barged into their house , searched it , and took their younger son to the police station . His son was released only when the man presented himself to the police , who detained him without telling him or his wife of his charges . His wife was given a copy of the First Information Report after 10 days . He was not able to meet or speak to his lawyer until he received bail over two months later .\nA 35-year-old man who was shot and injured during the violence in Delhi in February was detained without a warrant on April 7 , his lawyer said . His family went to three police stations to inquire about his whereabouts but were given no information . They were eventually informed that he had been arrested but were not given a copy of the First Information Report . His lawyer had to apply for his records through the courts and found out that he was charged with murder . He remains in jail .\nDue to the Covid-19 lockdown , those arrested have limited to no access to legal counsel or to family members . A 21-year-old man was arrested on April 7 on charges of rioting and arson . His lawyer told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that she is yet to meet her client : \u201c At the beginning of the lockdown , access to court records was a huge challenge . Generally , people being arrested were being sent into judicial remand without a lawyer present . I have had no contact with my client . Under normal circumstances , he would have been produced in court every 14 days and I would check on his health , have a conversation with him , move an application if he needs anything , but I can not do any of that now . \u201d\nActivists and students across the country , especially in BJP-ruled states , continue to be targeted for participating in anti-citizenship law protests . In Uttar Pradesh state , Farhan Zuberi , a student at Aligarh Muslim University , was arrested on charges of sedition , rioting , and attempted murder . Dr. Kafeel Khan was initially arrested for promoting enmity between groups for a speech during the protests , but after he received bail on February 11 , he was charged under the draconian National Security Act and kept in custody .\nIn Assam state , the police arrested several activists , charging some of them with sedition and under the UAPA . In January , Delhi police charged a university student , Sharjeel Imam , with sedition and he remains in jail . In February , Amulya Leona Noronha was arrested for sedition in Karnataka for raising the slogans for Pakistan and India unity at a protest but released on bail after over three months in detention because the authorities failed to file charges within the 90-day mandated time period .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 previously documented that the authorities responded to the largely peaceful protests in a partisan manner . In many cases , when BJP-affiliated groups attacked protesters , the police did not intervene .\nNor have the authorities taken any action against BJP leaders who incited violence against the protesters , calling to \u201c shoot \u201d them .
