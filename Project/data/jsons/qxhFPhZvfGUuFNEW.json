    "content": "A Guide To Spotting Pretzel Logic On The Campaign Trail\nIt 's a good thing presidential campaigns are n't college debates because politicians routinely spout arguments on the stump ( and in their ads ) that would never pass muster on the university rostrum .\nCampaigns are rife with logical fallacies aimed at whipping up voters and herding them to the polls . Some are deceptively difficult to recognize , while others are familiar but no less seductive .\n`` Fallacies are used all the time in campaigns , '' says Sam Nelson , director of forensics at Cornell University 's school of Industrial and Labor Relations .\n`` Human beings are busy . We have all kinds of information around us all the time , we do n't have time to logically think through every argument , so we 're looking for short cuts , '' Nelson says . `` The issue is whether you can recognize these short cuts that are really fallacies and avoid falling for them . ''\nAs we head into the final months before November elections \u2014 with party convention bluster , brutal ad wars and debate posturing \u2014 Americans will almost certainly be exposed to a lot more pretzel logic . So with the help of Cornell 's Nelson and Storey Clayton , a debate coach for Rutgers University Debate Union , here 's an election-season primer to help people at home spot the top five logical fallacies so far in this year 's presidential campaign . The Latin is optional .\nARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM \u2014 'Appeal to Authority ' What it means : There 's nothing like name-dropping a Founding Father , a former U.S. president or a Nobel laureate to boost your argument . But that still does n't change the substance of the argument . Why it works : `` It 's the devil we know as opposed to something new , which we 've never tried , '' Nelson says . `` There 's always risk in change . Some people are big risk takers , but most people seek safety . '' Examples from the campaign trail : Mitt Romney , July 29 Enlarge this image Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP `` Ronald Reagan was one of our great foreign policy presidents . He did not come from the Senate . He did not come from the foreign policy world . He was a governor . '' The Take-Away : `` As Reagan 's presidency has grown more distant , his star has sort of grown . He 's a very appealing authority figure , '' Clayton says .\nPresident Obama , Aug. 1 `` You do not have to take my word for it . Just today , an independent , nonpartisan organization ran all the numbers on Gov . Romney 's plan . This was n't my staff . This was n't something we did . An independent group ran the numbers . '' The Take-Away : `` This is a shortcut for most citizens who are n't willing to do the hard policy analysis . Obama is saying these people did the work so you do n't have to , '' Nelson says . YouTube\nPOST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC \u2014 'After this , therefore because of this ' What it means : The argument attempts to turn simple correlation into false or questionable causation . A textbook example : Because the birds sing every morning before the sun rises , the birds ' singing causes the sun to rise . Why it works : `` It 's a very appealing , intuitive fallacy , '' Clayton says . `` A lot of the arguments that people make around presidential campaigns , for example , are essentially drawing the inference that whatever happened in one 's time in office is their responsibility , whether or not they were actually responsible . '' Examples from the campaign trail : Mitt Romney , Aug. 1 `` We have fewer jobs under President Obama . Then there 's unemployed and underemployed . That 's gone up , that 's in red , because that 's a bad direction . Then we have the unemployment rate , that 's bad too , that 's why that 's in red . '' The Take-Away : `` What you 're trying to do in a presidential campaign is take relatively complex issues that there 's a lot of division on and simplify it so that everyone understands what you 're trying to say , '' Nelson says . `` Everyone understands the idea of a report card . Holding it up visually even makes it better . Now , is that report card based on reliable information ? We do n't know . '' YouTube\nEx-Steel Plant Worker Joe Soptic , Speaking In Obama-Affiliated PAC Priorities USA Ad `` When Mitt Romney and Bain closed the plant , I lost my health care . My family lost their health care . A short time after that , my wife became ill. ... She passed away in 22 days . '' The Take-Away : `` Someone responsible for a business is not necessarily responsible for every single decision or every single aspect that 's made within that business , '' Clayton says . `` But that 's exactly what this ad is trying to argue . It 's a classic example of giving someone responsibility over foreseeing every possible effect or every possible outcome . '' YouTube\nARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM \u2014 'Argument to the man ' What it means : Anyone who 's ever been verbally taunted or bullied in a schoolyard is familiar with argumentum ad hominem \u2014 basically a fancy debate term for name-calling . Its purpose , like that of all fallacies , is to divert attention away from substantive arguments . Why it works : `` It short-circuits the thinking part of your brain and makes you think , 'This guy 's an idiot , ' `` says Rutgers University 's Clayton . Nelson of Cornell agrees , saying ad hominems are `` funny and memorable '' and that the person launching one often benefits from being perceived as a fighter . `` It appeals to aspects of American culture that we got on the schoolyard and we still have when we 're adults , '' he says . The Take-Away : `` These examples basically reduce everything to name calling , '' Clayton says . `` They cut through the logic and all the rational arguments . '' Examples from the campaign trail : President Obama , Aug. 6 Gov . Romney `` would ask the middle class to pay more in taxes to give another $ 250,000 tax cut to people making more than $ 3 million a year . It 's like Robin Hood in reverse . It 's Romney Hood . '' YouTube\nMitt Romney , Aug. 7 `` We 've been watching the president say a lot of things about me and my policies , and they 're just not right . And if I were to coin a term , it would be 'Obamaloney . ' `` YouTube\nARGUMENTUM AD LOGICAM , aka 'Straw man argument ' What it means : Falsely creating an overly simplistic or undesirable argument because it 's easier to defeat than the real argument . Why it works : `` It basically works like an inoculation , '' Nelson says . `` Just like a vaccine uses a weakened version of a virus to stimulate an immune response , you tell the person a weakened version of an argument so that when the real thing appears , they have an idea how to answer it . You explain someone 's argument in a way that does n't give it full strength , and then you knock it down . '' Examples from the campaign trail : Mitt Romney , July 18 `` [ President Obama ] said something ... which really reveals what he thinks about our country , about our people , about free enterprise , about freedom , about individual initiative , about America . ... I just want to say it exactly as he said it , speaking about small business and business of all kinds , he said this , 'If you 've got a business , you did n't build that , somebody else made that happen . ' `` The Take-Away : In his speech , Romney takes Obama 's remark out of context to reduce a complex argument about the collective nature of success to a simple straw man , Clayton says . He adds : `` So , he is characterizing the argument that Obama did make , but he 's taking the worst possible , least relatable version of what Obama was saying and defeating that . '' YouTube\nPresident Obama , Aug. 9 Enlarge this image Carolyn Kaster/AP Carolyn Kaster/AP `` We 're certainly not going to follow Mr. Romney 's lead and go back to the days when women did n't have control of their own health care choices . '' The Take-Away : Obama hyperbolizes Romney 's position , `` making it sound like you 're going back to the 1300s and that women would have no control over their health care choices whatsoever , '' Clayton says . `` So , he 's making the most dramatic , worst-case version of the argument . Then it 's easy for him to make the case that his policies are better . ''",
