Those leaks , along with the drip-drip of information about the Usama bin Laden raid and the U.S. drone program , prompted accusations last year that the Obama administration was strategically releasing sensitive information to make President Obama look good in an election year .\nBrennan was never directly accused of leaking those details , and last summer he even condemned some of the leaks as `` devastating . ''\nBut some lawmakers are n't convinced Brennan , as the top White House adviser on counterterrorism matters , is in the clear either .\n`` To our knowledge , John Brennan has not been absolved of responsibility for the high-level national security leaks that have characterized this White House , '' an aide to Sen. John Cornyn , R-Texas , told FoxNews.com , noting the senator has `` some concern '' about the issue .\nSen. John McCain , R-Ariz. , has also raised questions about whether Brennan bears some responsibility for sensitive security details leaked to the media .\nBrennan , as he has been for the past four years , was in the top tier of Obama 's security advisers at the time of the leaks .\nLast July , then-House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith , R-Texas , included Brennan on a list of top administration officials he wanted to interview on the issue .
