    "content": "The French magazine Charlie Hebdo , attacked on Wednesday by terrorists who worked methodically through its Paris office with Kalashnikovs , was known for its provocative cartoons . Some of them mocked Islamic extremism , and they often portrayed the Prophet Mohammed , a fact that in itself is considered an insult and profound religious violation by many Muslims , extreme and not extreme .\nYet it would do a profound disservice to Charlie Hebdo and its leading cartoonists , many of whom were murdered in the attack , to describe it as an anti-Islam or anti-religion magazine , or to portray it as having provoked just for the sake of provocation .\nThe cartoonists of Charlie Hebdo were making a substantial point with their cartoons . That point is perfectly summed up , albeit in ways more subtle than first meet the eye , in one of its most famous covers , from November 2011 . The title reads `` Love is stronger than hate '' :\nThe cover depicts Charlie Hebdo ( the magazine portrayed by a generic male staffer with a pencil behind his ear ) kissing a generic Muslim man ; in the background are the smoldering ashes of the Charlie Hebdo office .\nThe context here : the magazine had recently published an issue `` guest-edited by Mohammed '' that depicted a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed on the cover saying , `` 100 lashes if you do n't die of laughter , '' with similar fare inside the issue . It was far from the first such cartoon in the magazine , but , in response , unknown assailants hacked Charlie Hebdo 's website and firebombed its offices .\nThe magazine was not just criticized by Islamist extremists . At different points , even France 's devoutly secular politicians have questioned whether the magazine went too far . French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius once asked of its cartoons , `` Is it really sensible or intelligent to pour oil on the fire ? ''\nIt is , actually . Part of Charlie Hebdo 's point was that respecting these taboos strengthens their censorial power . Worse , allowing extremists to set the limits of conversation validates and entrenches the extremists ' premises : that free speech and religion are inherently at odds ( they are not ) , and that there is some civilizational conflict between Islam and the West ( there is n't ) .\nThese are also arguments , by the way , made by Islamophobes and racists , particularly in France , where hatred of Muslim immigrants from north and west Africa is a serious problem .\nAnd that is exactly why Charlie Hebdo 's `` Love is stronger than hate '' cover so well captures the magazine 's oft-misunderstood mission and message . Yes , the slobbery kiss between two men is surely meant to get under the skin of any conservative Muslims who are also homophobic , but so too is it an attack on the idea that Muslims or Islam are the enemy , rather than extremism and intolerance .\nLaurent L\u00e9ger , a Charlie Hebdo staffer who survived the attack , told CNN in 2012 , `` The aim is to laugh . ... We want to laugh at the extremists \u2014 every extremist . They can be Muslim , Jewish , Catholic . Everyone can be religious , but extremist thoughts and acts we can not accept . ''\nThat this mission had gotten the magazine attacked in the past , and may have contributed to the terrorists ' motivation in murdering its staffers today , should show us all just how important it is , and how high the stakes are for all of us .",
