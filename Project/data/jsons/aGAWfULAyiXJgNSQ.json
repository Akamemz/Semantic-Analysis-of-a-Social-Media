She has denied steadfastly and consistently that she ever sent or received any materials marked `` classified \u201d while secretary of state using her private server .\nAll of her behavior has triggered the FBI investigation because she may have committed serious federal crimes . For example , it is a crime to steal federal property . What did she steal ? By diverting to her own venue the digital metadata that accompany all emails -- metadata that , when attached to the work-related emails of a government employee , belong to the government -- she stole that data . The metadata do not appear on her paper copies -- hence the argument that she stole and destroyed the government-owned metadata .\nThis is particularly troublesome for her present political ambitions because of a federal statute that disqualifies from public office all who have stolen federal property .

She did that by diverting those secrets to an unprotected , nongovernmental venue -- her own server -- and again by emailing those secrets to other unprotected and nongovernmental venues . The reason she can deny sending or receiving anything marked `` classified \u201d is that protected government secrets are not marked \u201c classified . \u201d\nSo her statement , though technically true , is highly misleading .
