His plan after graduation is to enroll in a technical college and get a certificate in precision machinery .\n\u201c I want to learn a skill , something I can do when I \u2019 m done with school , \u201d he says .\nFor students like Mr. Blanc , that step of education beyond high school holds the hope of a better life . For America , it could be the key to an economy that better serves the middle-skill workers who feel their futures are closing in front of them .\nTheir plight proved a major factor in the recent election , with Rust Belt states such as Michigan , Pennsylvania , and Wisconsin tilting to Donald Trump , who promised a renaissance of blue-collar jobs . But the contours of the United States labor market have long been clear . America is not going to see a major resurgence of the factory jobs that have fled to China or Mexico . The jobs of the future will be higher-value jobs , and the path to that prosperity will come through education .\nBy 2020 , 2 of every 3 jobs will require some kind of postsecondary education . And most of these jobs will be in services like health care , customer service , and food preparation , not the manufacturing sector . Among traditional blue-collar jobs , only construction is likely to see a major bump in employment over the next two presidential terms .\nIn many respects , the country is showing signs of adapting . This year marked the first time that the share of workers with a bachelor \u2019 s degrees or higher ( 36 percent ) exceeded those with a high school diploma or less ( 34 percent ) \u2013 a trend that will accelerate as more Millennials enter the labor market .\nBut the transition is slow , and the blue-collar labor market still hasn \u2019 t recovered from the Great Recession , forcing middle-skill workers to take low-income jobs that feel like a dead end . The only way up and out , experts say , is education .\n\u201c The one thing we do know is at the very bottom end if you don \u2019 t advance the skills of those who don \u2019 t graduate or barely graduate from high school , they are surely going to be left behind , \u201d says Alicia Modestino , an associate professor of public policy at Northeastern University in Boston who studies labor markets .\nThis shift away from an industrial economy , undergirded by unions and requiring less education , has been a long time coming . But the Great Recession accelerated the process : Companies laid off millions of white- and blue-collar workers doing routine tasks and invested more in machinery and IT software . Now , firms have been reluctant to hire back those workers , instead picking more educated , younger workers for higher-skilled positions .\nVirtually all the 11.6 million jobs created since 2010 went to workers with some kind of postsecondary education , according to a recent study by Georgetown University \u2019 s Center on Education and the Workforce . Workers with a four-year college degree were hired for nearly 3 out of every 4 positions . Those with a high school diploma or less saw almost no recovery in demand for their labor over this period .\n\u201c The recession has a way of bringing it all to the fore , separating the wheat from the chaff . At the end of the day , we know where demand is , where [ job ] creation is occurring and that some jobs are dying , \u201d says Nicole Smith , the center \u2019 s chief economist .\nThe worry is that the US job market is becoming polarized \u2013 split into a high-end track and a low-end track with little in the middle . Less-educated Americans with a high school diploma or less could get trapped in low-wage jobs while the income gains go to the top 5 to 10 percent .\nFor some workers , this is already reality : Wages for men without a college degree have barely budged in buying power since the 1970s . Millions have dropped out of the labor force entirely , either by choice or inability to find work .\nYet the jobs market still holds out hope for middle-skilled workers , so long as they have postsecondary education or training . Millions of Baby Boomers will be retiring and need to be replaced . Firms are looking for workers certified in specific industries that cluster in metro areas , from petrochemicals in Houston to health care in Boston , and pay decent salaries . Even manufacturers are hiring , though mostly for technicians and in logistics and other office jobs .\nSo high school counselors are trying to steer students like Blanc into postsecondary programs that give them an edge that their high school diploma alone can \u2019 t .
