It 's these pipes that are most often the cause of deadly gas explosions . VPC\nIn the four years since a natural gas explosion rocked San Bruno \u2014 killing eight people and injuring 51 others \u2014 gas pipelines have faced increased public scrutiny . But despite new regulations designed to identify and replace potentially dangerous pipelines , thousands of miles of high-risk pipeline remain in operation in Southern California .\nThe vast majority of those high-risk pipelines are operated by the Southern California Gas Co. , the nation 's largest natural gas distributor . Of the company 's nearly 50,000 miles of gas distribution pipeline , more than 3,000 are made of bare steel and more than 19,000 were built before 1970 \u2014 two factors that federal regulators describe as `` significant risk indicators . ''\nDespite those numbers , The Gas Co. has an above-average safety record , considering that it operates more miles of gas distribution pipeline than any other utility in the country . Since 2004 , the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration has recorded 34 `` significant '' gas leaks involving The Gas Co. pipelines that resulted in four deaths , four injuries , and more than $ 11 million in damage .\nNationwide , there have been more than 1,700 significant gas leaks over that time , resulting in 135 deaths , 600 injuries , and about $ 2 billion in damages . The Gas Co. has reported about 17 hazardous leaks per 1,000 miles of pipelines \u2014 less than half the national average of about 35 .\nAdditionally , The Gas Co. no longer operates cast iron pipelines , which are considered particularly dangerous . But experts say the company 's thousands of miles of bare steel pipelines \u2014 which can corrode more easily than modern pipelines , leading to hazardous gas leaks \u2014 are still cause for concern .\n`` We have all kinds of aging infrastructure , and we are n't dealing with it very well , '' said Carl Weimer , executive director of the nonprofit Pipeline Safety Trust in Washington state . `` We certainly support the idea of getting all cast iron out of the ground as soon as possible , but bare steel is the next step . ''\nPipeline safety expert Bob Ackley \u2014 who runs the Massachusetts-based consulting firm Gas Safety USA , which has tested for gas leaks across the country \u2014 calls bare metal pipelines `` a ticking time bomb . ''\n`` The steel 's going to corrode , '' Ackley said . `` It 's only a matter of time before it rusts out . ''\nAging and bare metal gas pipelines are a growing concern , particularly in the wake of the San Bruno explosion and other serious pipeline incidents . While many gas leak incidents are not caused by failing infrastructure \u2014 car accidents , careless digging and other factors are sometimes to blame \u2014 regulators have worked to identify and encourage the replacement of the pipelines most likely to fail .\nThe federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ( PHMSA ) \u2014 which provides guidance and minimum standards for state regulators \u2014 classifies bare steel pipelines as `` candidates for accelerated replacement programs . '' These pipelines were largely built in the 1960s or earlier , before the first federal safety rules for gas pipelines took effect in 1970 .\n`` Over the past few years , the numbers of those cast iron and bare steel pipes are going down , '' administration spokesman Damon Hill said . `` The states are working with operators to find ways that they can reduce the cost and fast-track those efforts . ''\nWhile The Gas Co. 's more than 3,000 miles of bare metal distribution pipeline are the third-most of any utility the country , those miles account for just 6.4 percent of its distribution pipelines , compared to a national average of 7 percent . Of the company 's 3,508 miles of transmission pipeline , just one is bare metal .\nTransmission pipelines \u2014 which usually transport natural gas from processing facilities to distribution centers \u2014 are generally larger and operate at a higher pressure than distribution pipelines , which usually transport gas from distribution centers to homes and businesses .\nThe California Public Utilities Commission \u2014 which regulates The Gas Co. and other utilities \u2014 has not mandated that bare steel pipelines be replaced . The agency has , however , required gas providers to launch `` integrity management programs '' for their distribution and transmission pipelines .\n`` Those integrity management programs basically lay out the principles that the utilities need to use in order to ensure the integrity of their pipelines , which includes how they prioritize or test the system \u2014 identifying the threats , ranking their risks , and then identifying and implementing different measures to protect them , '' said Elizaveta Malashenko , the utilities commission 's deputy director of safety and enforcement .\nAccording to Malashenko , utilities do n't necessarily need to replace bare metal pipelines to maintain safety . They can also outfit such pipelines with cathodic protection , which reduces their susceptibility to corrosion by connecting them to a `` sacrificial metal '' that corrodes more easily .\n`` Replacement is obviously one way to mitigate the risk , but cathodic protection is also a very effective mechanism , '' she said .\nBut while The Gas Co. 's single mile of bare metal transmission pipeline is cathodically protected , its 3,202 miles of bare metal distribution pipeline are not .\n`` The federal government is kind of pushing for bare steel to be out of the ground , '' Weimer said , `` because sooner or later , it will be a problem . ''\nDoug Schneider , vice president of gas engineering and pipeline integrity for The Gas Co. , said the company does not plan to replace all of its bare steel pipelines in the near future . Rather , it works to identify the pipelines most in need of repair or replacement through its Distribution Integrity Management Program and its Transmission Integrity Management Program , both of which are mandated by state regulators .\nUnder its transmission integrity program , The Gas Co. completed baseline assessments for all transmission pipelines by the end of 2012 . Additionally , under its Pipeline Safety Enhancement Program \u2014 which is also mandated by California \u2014 the company is conducting pressure testing for all transmission pipelines that have not had post-construction pressure tests , which were first required in 1970 .\nA key part of the company 's distribution integrity program is its Distribution Risk Evaluation and Monitoring System ( DREAMS ) , a computer modeling program that examines its infrastructure and prioritizes pipeline segments for replacement . Schneider said the system considers several factors , including whether a pipeline is coated , whether it 's cathodically protected , what material it 's made of , its leakage history , and its age .\n`` We do not compromise safety . If there 's any type of information that we think a pipeline is unsafe , we 'll take immediate action , '' Schneider said . `` But really , what we 're doing here is more replacement on a maintenance basis . We 're prioritizing pipes , and we 're replacing them . ''\nAccording to Schneider , The Gas Co. replaces about 100 miles of distribution pipeline per year under its DREAMS program \u2014 a process that can cost $ 1 million or more per mile . Weimer said regulators are often hesitant to mandate pipeline replacement because utilities would need to raise consumers ' gas rates to pay for it .\nAckley argues that gas utilities and state regulators need to think more seriously about raising customers ' gas rates to pay for pipeline replacement .\n`` They 're just going with the flow and rolling the dice , '' he said .\nStill , state regulators say replacing some bare metal pipelines is unnecessary , if a utility can show that those pipelines are in good working condition . Malashenko said utilities can take several steps \u2014 including cathodic protection , leak surveys and patrols , and direct assessments to check for corrosion \u2014 to ensure their pipelines are as safe as possible .\n`` It 's all about how the operator measures the risk , and manages the overall health of their system , and takes action when they need to , '' Hill said .\nSchneider said The Gas Co. has a `` continual goal to reduce the amount of pipe that is not cathodically protected and is also bare . He 's confident the company 's integrity management programs are advancing that goal \u2014 even if they leave some bare steel pipelines in place .\n`` If it 's performing very well , we 're going to look at something else , rather than replacing it for the sake of replacing it , '' Schneider said .\nThe relationship between a pipeline 's age and its reliability is less straightforward than the relationship between what it 's made of and how safe it is . The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration considers pre-1970 pipelines to pose greater risks than post-1970 pipelines , because the first federal safety rules governing gas pipelines took effect that year .\nThe Gas Co. operates more than 19,000 miles of distribution pipeline that were built before 1970 , the most of any utility in the country . Those miles account for 38.2 percent of the company 's distribution pipeline mileage \u2014 just above the national average of 37.9 percent .\nThe company 's network of transmission pipelines is even older . Of The Gas Co. 's 3,508 miles of distribution pipeline , 71.4 percent were built before 1970 \u2014 far more than the national average of 56.6 percent .\nBut regulators and pipeline experts say older pipelines are not necessarily more dangerous than newer ones . According to Weimer , `` the age of the pipeline is not a particularly good indicator for the risk . ''\n`` We 've seen brand-new pipelines that look really bad , and we 've seen ones that are 70 years old that look brand-new , '' Weimer said . `` A lot more of the risk is determined by how companies operate and maintain their pipelines . ''\nHill agreed , saying effective integrity management `` can counterbalance the impact of a pipeline 's overall age . ''\n`` An older pipeline does n't necessarily have a higher likelihood of leaking or rupturing than an older one , '' he said .\nAckley agreed that many aging pipelines are in good condition , but he questioned whether the hazardous leak data reported by federal regulators offers a complete picture of the safety of older pipelines . While The Gas Co. 's hazardous leak rate is half the national average , Ackley said the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration only counts leaks that happen near buildings and underground infrastructure as hazardous \u2014 leaving out many leaks that happen in more remote locations .\n`` I think people should know how old their pipe is , if it comes into their house , '' Ackley said . `` If you know you have an old pipe , you should be a little more vigilant than if you have a brand-new pipe . ''\nAs Schneider sees it , 1970 is `` not a magical year . '' The Gas Co. , he said , met many of the 1970 safety requirements decades before they took effect .\nThe age of a gas utility 's pipelines , Schneider added , is largely determined by the history of the area those pipelines serve \u2014 and Southern California 's population more than doubled between 1940 and 1970 .\n`` Our system was built over time to meet the demands of the growth of Southern California , '' he said . `` A properly maintained pipeline should last indefinitely . ''\nWhile the company has a particularly high percentage of transmission pipelines that were built before 1970 , it has just one mile of bare steel transmission pipeline \u2014 and that mile is cathodically protected . Those factors make `` the age issue less relevant , '' Weimer said .\n`` A majority of the pipeline in this country is pre-1970 , '' he said . `` It does n't sound like it 's out of the norm . ''\nFour people have died in incidents involving The Gas Co. pipelines over the last decade . In one of those incidents , three people died after a vehicle crashed into a Studio City building , causing a gas explosion . In the other , one person was killed by electrocution after tampering with gas distribution equipment in Los Angeles , in an apparent effort to siphon gas illegally .\nOf The Gas Co. 's 34 `` significant '' gas leak incidents over the past decade , seven have taken place in Riverside County \u2014 none involving deaths or injuries , and none in the Coachella Valley . An incident is generally considered `` significant '' if it results in a death , an injury , or at least $ 50,000 in property damage .\nTo an extent , the Coachella Valley is protected from the dangers of bare steel and aging pipelines . Pipelines closer to the ocean , Malashenko said , are subject to more moisture than desert pipelines and , as a result , are more likely to corrode .\n`` That 's a big part of it , where things are , '' she said . `` The ocean is not kind on infrastructure , above ground or underground . ''\nBut The Gas Co. 's thousands of miles of bare steel and pre-1970 pipelines are still a cause for concern \u2014 especially considering the hundreds of people who have died or been injured in gas pipeline incidents over the past decade . Ackley said that even if deserts are safer than coastal areas , it just takes one `` black swan '' \u2014 a low-probability , high-consequence event \u2014 to remind people how dangerous faulty pipelines can be .\nFor Malashenko , the key question is how well a company is addressing the risks posed by its pipeline network .\n`` The important part is , what are utilities doing about whatever mix of infrastructure that they have ? '' she said . `` In an ideal world , we 'd have brand-new pipelines everywhere , and there would n't be any aging infrastructure underground . But that 's not reality . ''\nThe public utilities commission has audited The Gas Co. 's distribution and transmission integrity management plans over the last few years , without finding any major concerns . The commission did , however , partly reject the company 's proposed Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan earlier this year , saying the prospective budget was `` too rudimentary to preapprove .
