The number of people crossing the border unlawfully is far down from its peak of nearly two decades ago.

The problem is that Congress has enabled that abuse of power by putting virtually no limits on the president\u2019s ability to declare an emergency.\u201d\n\nWhy did Congress give presidents such broad power?\n\nIn part by accident. When passing many emergency-powers laws, Congress attached a procedure that would let lawmakers override any particular invocation of that authority. The National Emergencies Act, for example, permitted Congress to rescind an emergency if both the House and the Senate voted for a resolution rejecting the president\u2019s determination that one existed.\n\nBut in 1983, the Supreme Court struck down such legislative vetoes.
