With more than 240,000 employees and an annual budget of $40 billion, it is the epitome of government bureaucracy. Although spending on security is essential, DHS\u2018 massive size has unintentionally caused it to become flat-footed and complacent.\n\nGiven our deteriorating fiscal situation, we must come to terms with the fact that endless spending is not the right solution to the evolving security challenges we face.

I think there are three concrete steps that can be taken to make not only TSA, but also the rest of DHS smarter and leaner without compromising security:\n\n1. Right-sizing the workforce. Nearly 1 out of every 4 DHS employees works at TSA. Over the past four years alone, TSA has increased its ranks by close to 10 percent. Meanwhile, passenger traffic at our nation\u2019s airports has declined. TSA could do a far better job of security with roughly 20 percent to 30 percent fewer, better-trained employees and could save up to $1.6 billion from DHS\u2018 annual budget.
