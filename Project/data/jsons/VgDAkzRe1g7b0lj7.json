Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi is seen complimenting a supporter by saying , `` If he invited me to a public hanging , I 'd be on the front row . ''\nHyde-Smith , who is white , is the appointed incumbent locked in a runoff for her Senate seat with Democratic challenger Mike Espy , a former congressman and U.S. agriculture secretary who is African-American .\nThe now viral video was posted on Twitter Sunday by Lamar White Jr. , publisher of a progressive site in Louisiana called The Bayou Brief . White says he received the video from a source . It shows Hyde-Smith speaking to a small group in Tupelo , Miss. , standing with cattle rancher Colin Hutchinson .\nIn a statement , Hyde-Smith said that her remark on Nov. 2 was an `` exaggerated expression of regard . ''\n`` Any attempt to turn this into a negative connotation is ridiculous , '' she said .\nAt a campaign event Monday , Hyde-Smith refused to answer repeated questions about her comments , saying she has nothing to add to her statement .\nEspy 's campaign calls Hyde-Smith 's comments `` reprehensible '' and says they have no place in political discourse .\n`` We need leaders , not dividers , and her words show that she lacks the understanding and judgment to represent the people of our state , '' said Espy campaign spokesman Danny Blanton in a statement .\nMississippi has a tortured history of racially motivated killings . According to the NAACP , Mississippi had 581 lynchings between 1882 and 1968 , more than any other state . The state 's population has the highest percentage of African-Americans of any state , 37 percent according to the last census .\n`` Hyde-Smith 's decision to joke about 'hanging , ' in a state known for its violent and terroristic history toward African-Americans is sick , '' said NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson in a statement to NPR . `` To envision this brutal and degenerate type of frame during a time when Black people , Jewish People and immigrants are still being targeted for violence by White nationalists and racists is hateful and hurtful . ''\nDuring an appearance on CNN , Espy was asked if the comment was racist .\n`` All I know is we need leaders now here in 2018 that will bring us together , '' Espy replied . `` My campaign is a campaign that tries to reach across the racial chasm , reach across the party chasm and bring us together . ''\nBecause neither candidate got more than 50 percent of the vote on Election Day , Espy and Hyde-Smith are in a runoff on Nov. 27 in the special election to replace former Republican Sen. Thad Cochran , who retired amid health concerns in April .\nMississippi GOP Gov . Phil Bryant stood by Hyde-Smith , whom he appointed to the seat .\n`` All of us in public life have said things on occasion that could have been phrased better , '' Bryant said , according to the AP . `` When you make as many speeches as we do in public life , that does occur . But I know this woman and I know her heart . I knew it when I appointed her . I know it now . She meant no offense by that statement . There was nothing in her heart of ill-will .
