Feeling confident he has done so , Mr. Buttigieg is starting to put greater emphasis on his service with the Navy Reserve , including a six-month deployment to Afghanistan .\nHe said overseas challenges , such as the political turmoil in Venezuela and U.S. tensions with Iran , offered a chance to make a foreign-policy appeal to voters .\nShare Your Thoughts How much should it matter whether a presidential candidate has military experience ? Join the conversation below .\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s particularly important right now to make clear what a strong , Democratic message on national security\u2014expressed by a veteran\u2014ought to look like , \u201d Mr. Buttigieg said . \u201c What I learned being in uniform is a really important part of that . \u201d\nMr. Buttigieg joined the Navy Reserve as an ensign in 2009 and spent time providing intelligence reports for European Command from the U.S. His six-month overseas assignment , in 2014 , was as an officer with the Afghanistan Threat Finance Cell , tracking financial networks that supported the Taliban and al Qaeda . His deployment overlapped with his job as mayor of South Bend , an office he assumed in 2012 .\nMr. Buttigieg has detailed his experiences in the Navy in his 2019 memoir and featured photos of his time in Afghanistan in campaign ads . But he presented his military record as part of his overall credentials rather than a primary feature of his candidacy . Now , he is changing his approach .\nDuring a swing in Iowa over the weekend , he made repeated mentions of his service .\nMr. Buttigieg told reporters after an event on Friday that a president needed to tread lightly on the world stage to avoid conflict . \u201c I have low confidence that this administration is capable of doing that . It \u2019 s one more reason we need a different kind of president . Ideally , one who knows , personally , what it means to be sent off to war . \u201d\nOn Saturday , in Iowa City , Mr. Buttigieg nodded to his service with an appeal for national unity . He told a crowd of more than 600 : \u201c The flag that was on my shoulder when I got on that plane to Afghanistan did not say Republican or Democrat on it . It was a flag for the United States of America . \u201d\nLater that day in Dubuque , Mr. Buttigieg talked up his service when calling for gun control . \u201c I trained on these things , \u201d he said of assault-style weapons . \u201c I know what they can do . \u201d\nUnlike most of their predecessors , Presidents Obama and Trump had no military experience .

Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and Seth Moulton of Massachusetts .\nTim Murtaugh , a spokesman for Mr. Trump \u2019 s 2020 campaign , said : \u201c We respect his service , but Pete Buttigieg implies that Franklin Roosevelt would not be fully qualified to be president because he didn \u2019 t serve in the military . And last we checked , FDR was a pretty good wartime president. \u201d ( President Franklin D. Roosevelt served as assistant secretary of the Navy under President Wilson . )\nIn his book , \u201c Shortest Way Home , \u201d the mayor describes his day-to-day routine in Afghanistan . \u201c I might have planned to spend my time behind a sophisticated computer terminal in a secure areas somewhere , and sometimes that \u2019 s just what I did , \u201d Mr. Buttigieg writes . \u201c But it turned out my services were more often needed as a driver or vehicle commander on convoys moving people or gear in and around Kabul . \u201d\nIn the interview Saturday , Mr. Buttigieg , who is gay , described what it was like serving in the military both under \u201c Don \u2019 t Ask , Don \u2019 t Tell \u201d and after it was repealed in 2011 . Mr. Buttigieg came out as gay in 2015 after returning from Afghanistan ; he has previously said living in a war zone compelled him to come out so that he could openly pursue a relationship .\n\u201c It wasn \u2019 t like flipping a switch , \u201d Mr. Buttigieg said . \u201c \u2018 Don \u2019 t Ask , Don \u2019 t Tell \u2019 was over when I went to Afghanistan .
