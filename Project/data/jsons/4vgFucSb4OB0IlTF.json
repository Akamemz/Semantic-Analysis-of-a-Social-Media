    "content_original": "Paul Singer\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nPresident Trump will take the podium on the floor of the House of Representatives Tuesday night for his first State of the Union address. He addressed Congress last February, but as with all new presidents, that was not technically a State of the Union address, as new presidents are not expected to deliver one only a few weeks after starting the job.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Tuesday's address:\n\nWhat time does it start?\n\nThe president will begin speaking shortly after 9 p.m. Eastern time, but the politics nerds among us will tune in a half hour early to watch the \"red carpet\" arrivals of Cabinet officials, military brass, the Supreme Court and other dignitaries who are announced by the doorkeeper and then proceed down the aisle to their seats.\n\nHow long will it last?\n\nExpect the speech to last about an hour, give or take 15 minutes.\n\nWhat will the president talk about?\n\nState of the Union addresses have traditionally served as a platform for the president to spell out his agenda for the upcoming year, usually with references to funding requests that will be included in the budget the president proposes a week or so after the speech.\n\nIn these times, the president's budget request has become a forgotten document \u2014 not only has Congress not acted on the budget request Trump issued last year, it has not even been able to pass a full government spending plan for 2018, which is why the country keeps lurching from shutdown threat to shutdown threat.\n\nSo we may not get much in the way of spending details, but President Trump is still expected to offer up a broad, forward-looking agenda, ranging from his continued pursuit of a wall on the U.S.- Mexico border to a massive infrastructure proposal he is expected to roll out in the next few weeks. He will also likely revisit remarks he made to global economic leaders last week in Davos, Switzerland, where he highlighted a strong U.S. economy and said the U.S. is \"open for business.\"\n\nThis year's overarching theme: Trump will say that under his leadership, American is becoming \"safe, strong and proud.\"\n\nWho has the counter argument?\n\nAfter Trump speaks, Democratic Rep. Joe Kennedy III \u2014 the grandson of former Sen. Robert Kennedy \u2014 will offer the opposing views in a brief televised response, and the Democrats will also offer a Spanish language response by Virginia state House Del. Elizabeth Guzman, whose victory over an 8-term Republican incumbent highlighted dramatic election-night gains in November for Democrats in the Commonwealth.\n\nWho will be in the chamber?\n\nSince Ronald Reagan, presidents have invited guests to the State of the Union address to highlight key policy areas they want to focus on. Expect Trump this year to introduce workers or business owners who are benefiting from the sweeping tax overhaul he signed in December, and perhaps a family affected by the opioid crisis.\n\nOne of the emotional highlights of last year's address was when Trump acknowledged Carryn Owens, the widow of William \"Ryan\" Owens, who died a month earlier in commando raid in Yemen that targeted the al-Qaeda terrorist network.\n\nDemocrats are also planing to bring guests, particularly \"DREAMers\" \u2014 young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children, whose temporary deportation protections were cancelled by Trump last fall.\n\nWho will protest?\n\nThere are an array of demonstrations planned both inside and outside the House chamber.
