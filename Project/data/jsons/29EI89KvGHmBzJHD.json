She slammed Sanders \u2019 campaign promises as too costly , while standing firm in claiming she \u2019 s a true \u201c progressive \u201d despite Sanders \u2019 comments to the contrary .\nSanders , meanwhile , dug in as he questioned whether Clinton really \u201c walks the walk \u201d of the progressive cause \u2013 and described her as the candidate of the \u201c establishment . \u201d\n\u201c Secretary Clinton does represent the establishment .
