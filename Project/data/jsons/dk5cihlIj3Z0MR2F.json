    "content": "An Army officer at the National Security Council who twice raised concerns over the Trump administration 's push to have Ukraine investigate Democrats and Joe Biden , arrived in military uniform Tuesday on Capitol Hill and is testifying behind closed doors in the impeachment inquiry .\nAlexander Vindman , a lieutenant colonel who served in Iraq and later as a diplomat , was prepared to tell House investigators that he listened to President Donald Trump 's July 25 call with new Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and reported his concerns to the NSC 's lead counsel , according to an advance copy of his testimony .\nHis arrival in military blue , with medals , created a striking image as he entered the Capitol and made his way to the secure briefing room .\n`` I was concerned by the call , '' Vindman was saying , according to the testimony obtained Monday night by The Associated Press . `` I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen , and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government 's support of Ukraine . ''\nVindman , a 20-year military officer , is the first official who listened in on that phone call to testify as the impeachment inquiry reaches deeper into the Trump administration and Democrats prepare for the next , public phase of the probe . He 's also the first current White House official to appear before the impeachment panels .\nThe inquiry is looking into Trump 's call , in which he asked Zelenskiy for a `` favor '' \u2014 to investigate Democrats \u2014 that Democrats say was a quid pro quo for military aid that could be an impeachable offense .\nTrump took to Twitter Tuesday to denounce the probe as a `` sham , '' adding : `` Why are people that I never even heard of testifying about the call . Just READ THE CALL TRANSCRIPT AND THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX IS OVER ! ''\nVindman , who arrived in the United States as a 3-year-old from the former Soviet Union , wrote that it was his `` sacred duty '' to defend the United States .\nSome Trump allies , looking for ways to discredit Vindman , questioning the colonel 's loyalties because he was born in the region . But the line of attack was rejected by some Republicans , including Rep. Liz Cheney , who said it was `` shameful '' to criticize his patriotism .\nHis appearance came a day after Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the House will vote on a resolution to affirm the impeachment investigation , set rules for public hearings and outline the potential process for writing articles of impeachment against Trump . The vote is expected Thursday .\nVindman was testifying that he first reported his concerns after an earlier meeting July 10 in which U.S . Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland stressed the importance of having Ukraine investigate the 2016 election as well as Burisma , a company linked to the family of Biden , a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate .\nVindman says he told Sondland that `` his statements were inappropriate , that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security , and that such investigations were not something the NSC was going to get involved in or push . ''\nThat account differs from Sondland 's , a wealthy businessman who donated $ 1 million to Trump inauguration and testified before the impeachment investigators that no one from the NSC `` ever expressed any concerns . '' He also testified that he did not realize any connection between Biden and Burisma .\nFor the call between Trump and Zelenskiy , Vindman said he listened in the Situation Room with colleagues from the NSC and Vice President Mike Pence 's office and was concerned . He said he again reported his concerns to the NSC 's lead counsel .\nHe wrote , `` I realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma , it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained . This would all undermine U.S. national security . ''\nVindman served in various military and diplomatic posts before joining the NSC .

He attended Zelenskiy 's inauguration with a delegation led by Energy Secretary Rick Perry , and he and Hill were both part of a Ukraine briefing with Sondland that others have testified irritated Bolton at the White House .\nHe said he is not the whistleblower , the still unnamed government official who filed the initial complaint over Trump 's conversation with the Ukraine president that sparked the House impeachment inquiry .
