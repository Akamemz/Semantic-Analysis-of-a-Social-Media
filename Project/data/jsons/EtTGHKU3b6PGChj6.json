Google upended the 2020 digital race last month by restricting how narrowly campaigns can target voters . Facebook could follow . Candidates might have to get creative to reach dog-loving steelworkers who live in the country , say , or women with advanced degrees who read at least sixteen books a year .\nThe Democratic Party can \u2019 t match this data operation . At least , not yet \u2013 Democrats are investing millions in a new data exchange intended to recapture the magic that elected Barack Obama , twice . Welcome to Red versus Blue , data edition . Sophisticated digital operations helped President Trump win in 2016 . Republicans hope to harness microtargeting power once again . Democrats are countering with Data Warehouse , a new platform to handle massive data sets that crashed their old system last time .\nThe Republican Party has collected 3,000 data points on every voter in the country , say GOP officials . This technological treasure will allow President Donald Trump \u2019 s reelection effort to target potential supporters with mail , phone calls , and even door-knock scripts tailored to individuals \u2019 interests .\nThe pundits were wrong , Ronna McDaniel decided . Donald Trump was viable in Michigan ; she had seen the data . Even in famously purple Macomb County , the Michigan Republican Party chairwoman at the time was confident in Mr. Trump \u2019 s chances .\n\u201c We knew that something was happening in Macomb County that the rest of the country was not seeing , \u201d said Ms. McDaniel , now the Republican National Committee chairwoman , speaking at a Monitor Breakfast last month .\nHistory bore her out . And the same data operation that defied political expectations and helped place Mr. Trump in the White House has returned for Round 2 \u2013 organized , flush with cash , and armed with reams of voter data dating back to 2012 .\n\u201c That \u2019 s the beauty of our data : allowing us to customize for the voter and then target them through digital mail , phones , and door knocks . And really have a conversation based on the things that we know they care about , \u201d said Ms. McDaniel .\nMeanwhile , the Democratic party is candidate-less , in debt , and banking on recent investments in a new data exchange to recapture the magic that fueled President Barack Obama \u2019 s victories .\n\u201c The benefits to being an incumbent extend far beyond \u2026 name recognition and having existing relationships with supporters . It means that candidates are able to build systems and collect data for years in advance of the general election , \u201d says Daniel Kreiss , an associate political communications professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill .\nHowever , Google upended the 2020 digital arms race last month by changing its digital advertisement policy to restrict who political campaigns could target . Both parties decried the move , saying it doesn \u2019 t address advertisements that spread lies or misinformation , which they see as crucial in the wake of a 2016 presidential election marked by digital disinformation .\nIf Facebook enacts similar rules , as many experts predict , it could radically alter campaign strategy and the 2020 trajectory . While it \u2019 s difficult to measure microtargeting \u2019 s impact , there \u2019 s no doubt that it was a factor in Donald Trump \u2019 s victory in 2016 , and Democrats see these tools as crucial to winning in 2020 . Depending on Facebook \u2019 s moves , campaigns will need to get creative , says Republican digital strategist Eric Wilson .\n\u201c You \u2019 re going to see campaigns looking at other ad networks and other platforms and working with people who will allow this kind of targeting , \u201d he says . \u201c Elections are won with votes and we \u2019 ve got to find the voters . \u201d\nRichard Drew/AP Political ads that were on Facebook displayed on a computer screen , Oct. 31 , 2019 , in New York . Twitter 's ban on political advertising is ratcheting up the pressure on Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg to follow suit . Zuckerberg doubled down on Facebook \u2019 s approach in a call with analysts Wednesday , Oct. 30 , he reiterated Facebook \u2019 s stance that \u201c political speech is important . ''\nLosing to President Obama in the 2012 election left Republicans smarting and determined to level the technological playing field . GOP officials say they have invested over $ 300 million into their data operation since then and have collected roughly 3,000 data points on every voter in the country , in a system jointly owned by the Trump campaign and the RNC .\n\u201c Donald Trump has a more sophisticated operation than anybody else does , \u201d says Laura Edelson , a computer scientist at New York University who studies online political communication . \u201c They \u2019 re being very conscious about tracking not just who goes to a Donald Trump rally , but maybe who goes to some kind of event that indicates they might be open to this message , something like a gun show . \u201d\nMobilization , rather than persuasion , is the campaigns \u2019 focus a year out , say political analysts . The campaigns try to get potential voters onto what \u2019 s called the \u201c ladder of engagement , \u201d which is a marketing term for getting a customer ( or voter ) more and more interested and involved in the product ( or candidate ) .\nGetting voters onto this ladder has allowed the Trump campaign to build small-dollar donor lists and amass a giant war chest , says Michael Luciani , CEO of The Tuesday Co. , whose app organizes campaign volunteers digitally .\n\u201c With money to run targeted advertisements , you can get more people to sign up as donors and collect more data , which allows you to both pay for and better target more advertisements , \u201d he says .\nThis cycle and strategy helped the Trump campaign and the RNC raise a gobsmacking $ 334 million this year , more than five times as much as the DNC . ( The four top-polling Democratic presidential candidates have raised about $ 220 million among them . ) The GOP campaign is also spending more on Google and Facebook advertisements than the top Democratic candidates by a wide margin , but that disparity could change if a clear front-runner emerges .\nRaising money doesn \u2019 t just fill a campaign \u2019 s coffers . It also stuffs spreadsheets .\n\u201c A lot of what is useful about doing something like microtargeting on Facebook is not just that you can give someone a message that is really tailor-targeted to them , \u201d says Ms. Edelson . \u201c You get back really tailor-targeted information about how they responded to that message . \u201d\nMicrotargeting or tailoring a political message to a person \u2019 s behaviors , attitudes , or beliefs helps campaigns figure out how to get a supporter even more engaged or move them up the ladder of engagement , says Bryan Whitaker , CIO for TargetSmart , a Democratic political analytics firm .\nThese tactics also allow campaigns to get creative in locating slivers of the population amenable to their message . For the GOP , that meant finding people who watched the Golf Channel or attended gun shows , and crafting an ad specifically to their tastes rather than an appeal to broad swaths of the population .\nThe Trump campaign doesn \u2019 t hoard this data either . They release the voter file , no strings attached , to any Republican running in any election across the country .\n\u201c Whether you \u2019 re running for President or local dog catcher , any candidate in the country with an \u2018 R \u2019 next to their name can access our data free of charge in our party-centric model that benefits all Republican candidates , \u201d said RNC spokesman Michael Joyce in an email to the Monitor .\nDemocrats , though , place more restrictions on their data . Presidential candidates who want to access the highly-coveted voter file must pay $ 175,000 and help the DNC raise money through fundraisers and other events . Candidates are \u201c investing in the DNC \u2019 s infrastructure , including overhauling our data and technology , \u201d the DNC wrote in an email to the Monitor .\nSince President Obama \u2019 s highly-touted data team in the 2012 election , the Democratic party has been playing catch-up . Part of that was unavoidable : saddled with $ 24 million in debt after 2012 , the Democratic National Committee couldn \u2019 t afford to keep the team intact . ( The DNC is $ 7 million in debt . )\nOne of the stars of that campaign was Vertica , which housed all the voter data and was considered quite cutting-edge . As the years passed , however , the technology grew bloated and unwieldy \u2013 so much so that after the 2016 election Hillary Clinton famously blasted the party \u2019 s data operation and said she \u201c inherited nothing \u201d when she became the presidential candidate .\n\u201c Think about it this way : you \u2019 ve got a brand-new Mac laptop and it moves real fast , it \u2019 s real nimble , \u201d says Mr. Whitaker . \u201c And six years later you \u2019 re like , oh my God , why is this thing just like so slow ? \u201d\nReplacing this outdated system became the party \u2019 s top priority under new DNC Chair Tom Perez . The party unveiled Vertica \u2019 s replacement earlier this year : Data Warehouse , a Google- and cloud-based platform that can handle massive data sets and analyses that so often crashed Vertica .\nThe second change was the establishment of the Democratic Data Exchange , which allows the party to exchange data with outside political groups . Data Trust , the GOP equivalent , has been around since 2011 and has fueled their recent success . Mr. Whitaker says with the creation of the exchange , the Democrats have \u201c gotten all of our pieces in place \u201d to challenge Republicans in 2020 . That said , the party still lacks a presidential candidate . Until one of the Democratic hopefuls wins , the DNC won \u2019 t have a partner with which to merge money streams , and develop a data strategy to match the unified Republican front .\n\u201c This is , again , one of those advantages of incumbency , \u201d says Mr. Kreiss . \u201c It would be impossible and unreasonable for us to expect Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker , Bernie Sanders to be doing a \u2018 vote Democrat \u2019 pitch right now or raising money or collecting email addresses for the party . \u201d\n\u201c In general , Republican presidents have invested more in party building and that extends to things like data operations . \u201d\nGoogle \u2019 s policy change means political campaigns will only be able to target people based on their age , gender , or location . Previously , it was an open field . A person \u2019 s political leanings or search history was fair game , as was tracking a user once they visit the campaign \u2019 s website .\nElections are about vying for eyeballs and finding votes , and limiting campaigns \u2019 tools limits their ability to reach potential supporters , says Mr. Wilson , the Republican strategist .\n\u201c It \u2019 ll be more difficult for campaigns to build their email lists and raise money from grassroots donors because you \u2019 re limiting your ability on how to reach them , \u201d he says .\nThese changes will help incumbents and hamstring campaigns without much pre-existing infrastructure , says Mr. Luciani .\n\u201c It makes it harder and more expensive to build your list of potential supporters , \u201d he says . \u201c It means that you also have to tailor your message to a broader audience . You can \u2019 t just microtarget people you know will support you . You \u2019 re going to be targeting a wider swath of the population . \u201d\nBoth parties echo the utility of microtargeting , but it \u2019 s trickier to figure out what these effects have on the people being targeted . Mr. Kreiss says this engagement cycle and digital ads overall have created an ethos of almost perpetual mobilization .\n\u201c If you look at the Trump ads , they \u2019 re always asking their supporters to do things , \u201d he says . \u201c They \u2019 re asking their supporters to click a link , to give money , to sign up , to volunteer , to give over their email address . They \u2019 re being asked to engage and do more on a regular basis much more often than what would have been the case 20 , 30 years ago . \u201d\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox . By signing up , you agree to our Privacy Policy\nThat perpetual mobilization would not be possible without Silicon Valley \u2019 s social media giants , all of whom are reckoning with their role as communities fueled by and facilitators of political speech . Twitter and now Google have announced targeting restrictions , and Facebook seems likely to follow suit in enacting rules that could have an outsized impact upon future elections .\n\u201c What content do people consider political ? \u201d says Ms. Edelson . \u201c It \u2019 s not entirely clear if a politician runs an ad that has no overt political message and says something like \u2018 Happy Holidays \u2019 \u2013 is that a political message ? Does it influence people \u2019 s perceptions of a politician ? Those are things that we \u2019 re actively trying to get answers to . \u201d",
