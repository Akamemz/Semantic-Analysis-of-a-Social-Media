''\nThe Christmas speech is titled `` Urbi et Orbi '' : to the city and the world .\nHe prayed that God would comfort those who are suffering , and he called on people to show good will and find solutions to ongoing humanitarian crises . Francis urged an end to conflicts in the Middle East , Latin America , Ukraine and Africa , and prayed for those who are persecuted on the basis of religion .\n`` May Christ bring his light to the many children suffering from war and conflicts in the Middle East and in various countries of the world , '' Francis said in his seventh Christmas address as the head of the Roman Catholic Church .\n`` May he bring comfort to the beloved Syrian people who still see no end to the hostilities that have rent their country over the last decade .

May he inspire governments and the international community to find solutions to allow the peoples of that region to live together in peace and security , and put an end to their unspeakable sufferings . ''\nLast week , Francis placed a cross encircled by a life jacket inside the Vatican , in memory of the migrants who drowned in the Mediterranean Sea as they sought refuge in Europe .\nIn a separate message on Wednesday , the pope and two other religious officials urged leaders in South Sudan to uphold their commitment to form a coalition government next year .
