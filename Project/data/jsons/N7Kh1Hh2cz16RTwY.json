The gun lobby \u2019 s opposition to reasonable controls is already fierce , and political courage is , as ever , wavering in Congress . But this singular opportunity to curb the gun violence must not be wasted in more of the posturing in Washington that tolerates 30,000 gun deaths a year .\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to hear a raft of proposals , including a vitally needed ban on fast-firing semiautomatic weapons , like the military-style Bushmaster assault rifle the Newtown gunman used in his killing spree at Sandy Hook Elementary School . The measure would also ban ammunition magazines that can hold more than 10 bullets , which have facilitated battlefield-scale killing of the innocent in the Newtown school , the movie theater in Aurora , Colo. , and dozens of similar tragedies .\nMaking federal background checks universal , instead of limiting them to sales by licensed gun dealers , is no less vital , closing a loophole that lets 40 percent of firearm sales take place with no oversight . This proposal is the chief goal of many gun-control groups and has a different aim than the assault weapons ban : the proliferation of handguns that are used in most gun violence , particularly in cities .\nAnother measure would create a separate criminal offense for gun trafficking and toughen penalties on those involved , including the \u201c straw buyers \u201d who purchase weapons later funneled into criminal hands . This should be accompanied by tighter restrictions on high-risk gun dealers who sell a disproportionate number of the guns traced to crimes , as well as new resources for more frequent inspection of all gun stores . Congressional corridors and committee evasions are not the way to advance these bills . They should be debated and voted on in public view so each lawmaker can be tallied on these major issues .
