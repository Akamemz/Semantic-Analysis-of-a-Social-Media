Anthony was a vehement opponent of the 15th Amendment . That \u2019 s the amendment which reads , \u201c The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race , color , or previous condition of servitude. \u201d Why would this genuine icon of feminism ( not to be confused with hustlers like Hillary Clinton ) object to such a huge leap forward for democracy and justice ? She believed it didn \u2019 t go far enough .\nWhat has this to do with Obamacare repeal ? Anthony \u2019 s argument against ratifying the 15th Amendment was identical to that which Senators Ted Cruz , Dean Heller , Ron Johnson , Mike Lee , and Rand Paul are using to justify their refusal to support the Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017 ( BCRA ) , a draft of which can be found here . Anthony was outraged that the 15th Amendment failed to extend the franchise to women . She was morally right , but politically na\u00efve . If that amendment had included the word \u201c sex , \u201d or \u201c gender \u201d as it would be formulated in our era , it would never have been ratified in 1870 .\nFor those who find the analogy between the 15th Amendment and Obamacare strained , consider that the former passed the House 144 to 44 and the Senate 39 to 13 , receiving zero Democrat support in either body . And ratification also encountered enormous resistance . In the end , the amendment was ratified by enough states , but not before being rejected by California , Delaware , Maryland , Kentucky , New Jersey , Oregon , and Tennessee . All of which means that , if Susan B. Anthony had prevailed in her quixotic quest to include women \u2019 s suffrage in the 15th Amendment , black men may have waited decades to get the vote .\nLikewise , we will be forced to live with Obamacare \u2014 in its current dysfunctional form \u2014 for decades if headline hounds like \u201c Grandstand Rand \u201d Paul insist on sprinting from one broadcast studio to another braying about insurance for $ 1 a day and parroting Democrat talking points like the following : \u201c The insurance companies make all the money ; all of this is predicated upon still propping up the insurance companies. \u201d Senators Cruz , Heller , Johnson , and Lee are not as irresponsible as Paul , but they tend to resist the reality that politics is the art of the possible . Lee provides an example in his statement on BCRA :\n[ T ] he Senate healthcare bill released yesterday does not repeal Obamacare . It doesn \u2019 t even significantly reform American healthcare\u2026 It bails out insurance companies . It props up Obamacare through the next election . It lays out plans to slow Medicaid spending beginning in 2025 , but that probably won \u2019 t happen . And it leaves in place the ham-fisted federal regulations that have driven up family health insurance premiums by 140 percent since Obamacare was implemented . As the bill is currently drafted , I won \u2019 t vote for it .\nThis nonsense suggests that Lee doesn \u2019 t get how reconciliation works . He has been in the Senate since 2011 , and should know about the Byrd Rule : \u201c The Byrd Rule generally treats as extraneous any provision of a reconciliation measure that doesn \u2019 t change the level of spending or revenues , or where the change in spending or revenues is \u2018 merely incidental \u2019 to the provision \u2019 s non-budgetary effects. \u201d Thus , Lee \u2019 s kvetching about the failure to eliminate Obamacare \u2019 s regulations is na\u00efve . Even less insightful is his claim that BCRA doesn \u2019 t significantly reform American healthcare . He clearly doesn \u2019 t get its Medicaid provisions .\nObamacare \u2019 s Medicaid expansion is a cruel fraud . It perverted the program \u2014 at the expense of poor children , the disabled , and the elderly \u2014 to cover able-bodied adults whose incomes exceed federal poverty guidelines .
