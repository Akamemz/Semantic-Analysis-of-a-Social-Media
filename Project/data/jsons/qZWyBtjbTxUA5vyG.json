    "content": "In their annual Gates Foundation letter , released Tuesday morning , Bill and Melinda Gates identify three persistent myths about global development that drive them crazy : that poor countries are doomed to stay poor , that foreign aid is a big waste and that saving lives leads to overpopulation .\nAll three , as Bill Gates put it , are informed by \u201c a dim view of the future , one that isn \u2019 t improving but staying poor and sick , and getting overcrowded. \u201d And how infuriating to the Gateses , who have pledged to spend their entire fortune\u2014currently estimated at some $ 72 billion\u2014on their foundation \u2019 s save-the-world work . In a conversation the other day about the myths , both couple couldn \u2019 t help but circle back to the big gap between their pragmatic , numbers-driven case for interventions that work\u2014and the persistence of false ideas and just wrong thinking . For Melinda Gates , who has taken on global access to contraception as a personal cause in recent years , there \u2019 s wonder that we \u2019 re still debunking the 1968 bestseller The Population Bomb , warning of the apocalyptic\u2014and very much yet to happen\u2014consequences of exploding global population . \u201c And now I \u2019 m going on the Jimmy Fallon show to try to change that 1970s misconception , \u201d Bill Gates added .\nThe conversation got us thinking . There are so many exaggerations and plain untruths out there about how the United States operates in the world , we at \u2588\u2588\u2588 Magazine decided to ask a group of globally minded people\u2014from diplomats and senators to economists and entrepreneurs\u2014to tell us : What myth about America \u2019 s role in the world most drives them crazy ? From the size of the U.S. foreign aid budget to the commander in chief \u2019 s power to change world events , from America \u2019 s isolationism to its secret hegemonic machinations , here are the misconceptions we heard from more than two dozen big thinkers .\nJohn Negroponte , former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and director of national intelligence under President George W. Bush\nThe biggest myth out there is that \u201c people hate us \u201d around the world . I have served at eight diplomatic postings abroad in four different continents and always encountered respect and admiration for what the United States stands for . Our political and economic systems are the envy of many across the globe and a magnet to millions seeking to reach our shores as visitors , immigrants or refugees . There are , to be sure , those who find fault with what America stands for , even to the point of outright hatred ; but I am convinced , based on more than five decades of having lived and traveled abroad , that they represent a very small , albeit vocal , minority . American can and does stand tall among nations of the world , and we are still looked to for a strong global leadership role .\nThe most bizarre myth I encounter in my travels is that the CIA is this omniscient , omnipotent organization that manages to pull strings all over the world and make things work . These conspiracy theories attribute to the CIA miraculous abilities and language skills ; as a taxpayer , I only wish that they were true . You \u2019 d think the Ray Davis affair might have taught Pakistanis in particular something of the CIA \u2019 s limitations . In fact , of course , the CIA has its fair share of incompetents who struggle with English , let alone foreign languages .\nStephen Walt , professor of international affairs at the Harvard Kennedy School\nThere are two myths that habitually infect U.S. foreign policy discourse . The first is the myth that U.S. foreign policy is powerful shaped by moral concerns . Nothing could be further from the truth : The United States has allied with brutal dictators , killed millions in illegal wars and through economic sanctions , and turned a blind eye to various atrocities whenever U.S. interests weren \u2019 t involved . Like with other great powers , in short , U.S. foreign policy is driven primarily by realpolitik ; by the desire to maximize U.S. power and primacy for as long as possible .\nA second and related myth is the notion that Washington always has the right answer to assorted world problems . Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright famously said that the United States \u201c stands taller and sees farther than others do , \u201d but there \u2019 s scant evidence to support that self-flattering notion . The United States may not be as prone to folly as some other states , but it is certainly not immune from it either . Just look at our inept Middle East diplomacy , our mishandling of relations with Russia and that little kerfluffle on Wall Street back in 2008 .\nWhat drives me the most crazy is the myth that our country \u2019 s power is diminished when we cooperate with other countries to achieve our national security interests . We are , as President Clinton said and I have often said since , the indispensable nation to this day . But there is nothing in the definition of \u201c indispensable \u201d that says \u201c alone. \u201d Another way to put it would be to engage in multilateral diplomacy , something I dabbled in once . The problem many Americans seem to have with \u201c multilateralism \u201d as a term is that it has too many syllables and ends in \u201c -ism \u201d ! What it really means is \u201c partnerships. \u201d Our country can be stronger and more effective when it engages in partnerships\u2014with allies , with businesses , with civil society\u2014to make our country and the world a better place .\nCharles Kenny , senior fellow at the Center for Global Development and author of The Upside of Down : Why the Rise of the Rest Is Good for the West\nAmerica is really generous giving to the world , and especially when you account for private philanthropy .

Private development assistance in the United Kingdom also equals 0.2 percent of gross national income\u2014while government assistance equaled 0.6 percent in 2011 . Add the two together , and the United States is one-half as generous as Great Britain \u2014 and two-fifths as generous as Sweden .\nAnother persistent myth is about America \u2019 s outsized role in peacekeeping when in fact the United States provides a fraction of 1 percent of United Nations peacekeeping forces\u2014which , especially after the last 10 years , look a little more effective at keeping the peace than go-it-alone U.S. efforts . America does have airlift and sealift capacities that are the envy of the world and plays a vital supporting role in some of those U.N. missions , but it is developing countries that do most of the heavy lifting in terms of troop numbers .\nEthan Zuckerman , director of the Center for Civic Media at MIT and author of Rewire : Digital Cosmopolitans in the Age of Connection\nWhat drives me craziest is the idea that United States has the ideal solution to all problems and that , by exporting what we know how to do well to the developing world , we \u2019 ll address endemic problems . The desire to do something helpful , combined with an implicit assumption that people in poor countries have no thoughts on how to solve their own problems , inevitably leads to failure .
