    "content": "In its final 20 minutes , the documentary film AKA Jane Roe delivers quite the blow to conservatives who have weaponized the story of Jane Roe herself\u2014real name , Norma McCorvey\u2014to argue that people with uteruses should have to carry any and all pregnancies to term .\nMcCorvey , who died in 2017 , became Jane Roe when , as a young homeless woman , she was unable to get a legal or safe abortion in the state of Texas . Her willingness to lend her experience to the legal case for abortion led to the passing of Roe v. Wade in 1973 , which legalized abortions in all 50 states ( though red states do all they can to get around this ; recently , several have even used the COVID-19 pandemic to make abortions functionally impossible to procure ) . But conservatives had a field day in the mid '90s when the assertive , media-savvy pro-choice advocate and activist McCorvey became an anti-abortion born-again ex-gay Christian with the help of leaders of the evangelical Christian right , Reverend Flip Benham ( of the infamous Operation Rescue ) and Reverend Rob Schenck . A conservative film , Roe v. Wade , starring Jon Voight and Stacey Dash , will dramatize McCorvey \u2019 s \u201c conversion . \u201d\nBut those filmmakers , and the rest of the pro-life evangelical community , have another curveball coming . In the final third of director Nick Sweeney \u2019 s 79-minute documentary , featuring many end-of-life reflections from McCorvey\u2014who grew up queer , poor , and was sexually abused by a family member her mother sent her to live with after leaving reform school\u2014the former Jane Roe admits that her later turn to the anti-abortion camp as a born-again Christian was \u201c all an act . \u201d\n\u201c This is my deathbed confession , \u201d she chuckles , sitting in a chair in her nursing home room , on oxygen . Sweeney asks McCorvey , \u201c Did [ the evangelicals ] use you as a trophy ? \u201d \u201c Of course , \u201d she replies . \u201c I was the Big Fish. \u201d \u201c Do you think you would say that you used them ? \u201d Sweeney responds . \u201c Well , \u201d says McCorvey , \u201c I think it was a mutual thing . I took their money and they took me out in front of the cameras and told me what to say . That \u2019 s what I \u2019 d say. \u201d She even gives an example of her scripted anti-abortion lines . \u201c I \u2019 m a good actress , \u201d she points out . \u201c Of course , I \u2019 m not acting now . \u201d\n\u201c I think it was a mutual thing . I took their money and they took me out in front of the cameras and told me what to say . That \u2019 s what I \u2019 d say . \u201d\nSweeney shows the video of McCorvey \u2019 s confession to her friends and acquaintances on the pro-abortion and anti-abortion sides , including pro-choice activist Charlotte Taft who , on the verge of tears , says , \u201c That just really hurts because it \u2019 s big stakes . It \u2019 s just really big stakes . \u201d\nReverend Schenck , the much more reasonable of the two evangelical leaders featured in the film , also watches the confession and is taken aback . But he \u2019 s not surprised , and easily corroborates , saying , \u201c I had never heard her say anything like this\u2026 But I knew what we were doing . And there were times when I was sure she knew . And I wondered , Is she playing us ? What I didn \u2019 t have the guts to say was , because I know damn well we \u2019 re playing her. \u201d Reverend Schenck admits that McCorvey was \u201c a target , \u201d a \u201c needy \u201d person in need of love and protection , and that \u201c as clergy , \u201d people like Schenck and Benham were \u201c used to those personalities \u201d and thus easily able to exploit her weaknesses . He also confirms that she was \u201c coached on what to say \u201d in her anti-abortion speeches . Benham denies McCorvey was paid ; Schenck insists she was , saying that \u201c at a few points , she was actually on the payroll , as it were. \u201d AKA Jane Roe finds documents disclosing at least $ 456,911 in \u201c benevolent gifts \u201d from the anti-abortion movement to McCorvey .\nReverend Benham then blurts out , \u201c Yeah , but she chose to be used . That \u2019 s called work . That \u2019 s what you \u2019 re paid to be doing ! \u201d Schenck \u2019 s thinking is quite different : \u201c For Christians like me , there is no more important or authoritative voice than Jesus , \u201d he explains . \u201c And he said , \u2018 What does it profit in the end if he should gain the whole world and lose his soul ? \u2019 When you do what we did to Norma , you lose your soul . \u201d\nIn fact , Reverend Schenck underlines his own conversion , which took place in the last decade : \u201c I still identify as an evangelical , but I like to think of myself as lovingly critical of my community . I guess in some ways I \u2019 d like to use whatever years I have remaining to undo the damage that I did and that many movement leaders did on the pro-life side . I used to think that Roe v. Wade would never be overturned . I think Roe v. Wade could be overturned now . And I think the result of that would be chaos and pain . And to impose that kind of crisis on a woman is unthinkable . \u201d\n\u201c \u2018 AKA Jane Roe \u2019 finds documents disclosing at least $ 456,911 in \u2018 benevolent gifts \u2019 from the anti-abortion movement to McCorvey . \u201d\nAnother crisis the evangelicals imposed was that of their homophobic teachings . To be born-again , McCorvey was required to stop having a romantic relationship with her long-time girlfriend\u2014and , for a while , her only family\u2014Connie . According to interviews , this confused and hurt Connie , though she stayed in the relationship for a decade after McCorvey \u2019 s conversion . Eventually , in 2004 , Connie had a stroke ; McCorvey moved out after a few years . Connie died two years before McCorvey , in 2015 . McCorvey always kept mementos from their romance , including jewelry Connie gave her , and expresses profound sadness over Connie \u2019 s death in the documentary . Unfortunately , AKA Jane Roe never explains why , if McCorvey \u2019 s born-again anti-abortion stance was all for the money , she would \u2019 ve ended her romantic relationship with Connie while continuing their domestic one . And if , on the contrary , the relationship wasn \u2019 t really over , then what could explain Connie \u2019 s anguished interviews\u2014surely , the act of a conservatory-trained actor if they , too , were a ruse ?\nAKA Jane Roe does succeed at painting a complex portrait of McCorvey , who was punished for being attracted to women from the time she was ten years old and ran away with a girlfriend .
