Our Country is counting on you ! \u201d the president tweeted , referring to congressional slang for overhauling the Senate filibuster so legislation can pass with just 51 votes , as opposed to the usual 60 .\nThe president prodded McConnell to shatter Senate precedent after the House approved $ 5.7 billion for a border wall as part of a measure to fund the government through early February .
