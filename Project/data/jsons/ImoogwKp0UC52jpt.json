    "content": "Speaking on CNN on Tuesday , Democratic presidential candidate Rep. Tulsi Gabbard ( D-HI ) argued that the United States was the cause of the attack on the Aramco oil facility in Saudi Arabia which the United States has said was launched by Iran . Referring to the tough sanctions placed on Iran by the United States , Gabbard stated , \u201c This latest attack on Saudi Arabia is a retaliatory attack because of all the sanctions in place that are essentially blocking Iran from selling their oil on the market . \u201d\nGabbard , whose history includes support for the Syrian regime that is allied with Iran , also attacked President Trump , claiming , \u201c He is treating our troops as though we are something that can be pawned off or prostituted off to the highest bidder . \u201d\nThe exchange prompting Gabbard \u2019 s claim that the U.S. caused Iran to launch their attack started with the CNN host asking , \u201c You \u2019 re running for president . If you were president right now , how would you deal with Iran ? \u201d\nI would see the situation for what it is , which is this latest attack on Saudi Arabia is a retaliatory attack because of all the sanctions in place that are essentially blocking Iran from selling their oil on the market . So by recognizing this is a retaliatory attack , that we can not continue this cycle of retaliation that can only lead to an all-out inferno of a war , both in Iran and across the region that would be so costly and devastating that would make the war we served in in Iraq look like a picnic in comparison in lost American lives , trillions of taxpayer dollars , exacerbating already a terrible refugee crisis . This is not serving the interests of our people nor is it serving the interests of our national security . As president right now what I would do is re-enter the Iran nuclear agreement , take away those \u2014 those sanctions that have been put in place so that Iran is brought back into an agreement where they are complying . We have inspectors going in \u2014 because every single day this doesn \u2019 t happen , Iran is moving forward towards developing a nuclear weapon . \u201d\nThe CNN host then referred to Gabbard \u2019 s remarks on September 16 in which she tweeted at Trump , \u201c Despicable . Offering to place our military assets under the command of a foreign country\u2014Saudi Arabia\u2014is a disgrace and betrayal of my patriotic brothers and sisters in uniform and to our Constitution .
