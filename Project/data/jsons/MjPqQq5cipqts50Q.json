Wuerl , archbishop of Washington , and the Vatican systematically worked to cover it up .\nAt almost 900 pages , the exhaustive report details methods by leaders of the dioceses to insulate accused members of the church from outside prosecution and judgment \u2014 employing the same strategies uncovered by The Boston Globe \u2019 s 2002 report on the systematic cover-up of sexual abuse within the Catholic Church .\nThe investigating team received files on at least 100 other priests but didn \u2019 t include them in the report for lack of sufficient evidence . The actual number of child victims is believed to be in the thousands , the jurors wrote , but there is no information because they either didn \u2019 t come forward or the dioceses didn \u2019 t create written records for all times they heard of the abuse .\nThe six dioceses \u2014 Allentown , Erie , Greensburg , Harrisburg , Pittsburgh and Scranton \u2014 serve nearly 1.6 million Catholics in Pennsylvania .\nIn 1993 , Cardinal Wuerl , then bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh , coined the term \u201c circle of secrecy \u201d to describe the methods in place to protect accused members of the church , according to the report .\nThe cardinal denies he came up with that term , according to the spokesman for the Washington Archdiocese .\nThis included downplaying accusations of rape and molestation with euphemisms like \u201c horseplay \u201d and \u201c wrestling , \u201d transferring accused priests around the country or placing them on \u201c health leave \u201d while keeping them on the church payroll \u2014 at times to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars . In some instances , accused sexual abusers were promoted .\nOther methods included covering costs of victims related to medical and psychological care and settlements to victims with the signing of a confidentiality agreement .\nCardinal Wuerl on Tuesday defended his role in the church at the time .\n\u201c While I understand this report may be critical of some of my actions , I believe the report confirms that I acted with diligence , with concern for the victims and to prevent future acts of abuse , \u201d the archbishop said in a statement before the grand jury was released . \u201c I sincerely hope that a just assessment of my actions , past and present , and my continuing commitment to the protection of children will dispel any notions otherwise made by this report . \u201d\nThe report \u2019 s effect on the Pennsylvania dioceses , as well as the Vatican , could be seismic and costly . The Archdiocese of Boston in 2002 paid $ 10 million to victims of a priest who had abused more than 130 children during his tenure and in 2003 paid $ 85 million to victims and their parents who had filed lawsuits over the abuse .
