A public memorial service is planned , they said .\n`` The outpouring of love and support over the last week has been tremendous , '' Denise and Bill Richard said in the statement . `` We laid our son Martin to rest , and he is now at peace . ''\nFamily , friends and colleagues mourned slain Massachusetts Institute of Technology police Officer Sean Collier at a private memorial service in Stoneham , Massachusetts , CNN affiliate WHDH reported .\nA memorial service open to law enforcement officers and the MIT community is scheduled for Wednesday on MIT 's campus , the university said .\nCollier was killed Thursday night , near the beginning of a wild 24 hours that culminated in Dzhokhar Tsarnaev 's capture in the backyard of a home in Watertown , a Boston suburb . Authorities suspect Tsarnaev and his 26-year-old brother of killing the officer , though Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has not been charged in Collier 's death .\nAccording to a source with direct knowledge of the investigation , Collier did n't even have time to activate his emergency alert before being shot four or five times in the chest and head as he sat in his patrol car on the MIT campus .\nIt 's not clear why the brothers allegedly ambushed the officer , the source said .\nThe source said investigators believe the Tsarnaevs then carjacked a black SUV , took the driver hostage and drove past the scene of the shooting before going to a gas station .\nInvestigators believe Tamerlan Tsarnaev carried out the car jacking while his younger brother was nearby at the time , a U.S. official told CNN Tuesday .\nIn an exclusive interview with CNN affiliate WMUR , a man identifying himself as the carjacking victim said he was worried for his life .\n`` They asked me where I 'm from . I told them I 'm Chinese , '' WMUR quoted the man as saying . `` I was very scared . I asked them if they were going to hurt me . They said they wo n't hurt me . I was thinking , ' I think they will kill me later . ' ``\nThe man escaped when the brothers stopped to fill up the gas tank , running for his life as one of the brothers swore at him , WMUR reported .\nMore than two months before the marathon bombings , Tamerlan Tsarnaev bought two reloadable mortar style fireworks a New Hampshire store .\nOn February 6 , Tsarnaev had one question for a store assistant at Phantom Fireworks in Seabrook , New Hampshire : `` What 's the biggest and loudest thing you have ? ''\nAfter that , store Vice President William Weimer said , Tsarnaev shelled out $ 200 cash for two `` lock and load kits . ''\nWeimer said such behavior is very common in the store . He said the store notified the FBI after discovering that the marathon bombing suspect had bought explosives there .\nLaw enforcement officials told CNN earlier Tuesday that the number of fireworks bought at the store was not enough to set off explosions the size of those at the Boston Marathon .\n`` My assumption is they bought this , experimented with it and decided against it and moved on and found another source , '' Weimer said .\nTamerlan Tsarnaev was pronounced dead early Friday . On Friday night , police captured Dzhokhar Tsarnaev hiding inside a boat in a backyard .\nBoat owner David Henneberry told CNN affiliate WCVB Tuesday that his obsession with how his boat was stored just right led him to discover the suspect as he stood on a ladder replacing two pads that had fallen out of the shrink wrap protecting his boat for the winter .\n`` I got three steps up the ladder and rolled the shrink wrap . I did n't expect to see anything , but I saw blood on the floor of the boat . A good amount of blood . ... And I looked back and forth a couple of times and my eyes went to the engine block and there was a body , '' he told the affiliate .\nHenneberry said Tuesday that he does n't even remember climbing down the ladder and running to the phone to dial 911 , delivering the tip that would lead to Tsarnaev 's capture .\n`` I did n't waste any time . I did n't ask him if he wanted a cup of coffee . I was off that ladder . That is all I remember , '' he told the affiliate .\nInvestigators swarmed the scene , forming a perimeter . Multiple shots rang out from behind the house , Boston Police Superintendent William Evans said Tuesday .\nAuthorities are still investigating whether Tsarnaev was armed and whether a shootout occurred at the boat , Evans told reporters .\n`` Clearly from everybody 's vantage point , we could see whoever was in that boat was poking at that top , '' he said .\nIt was n't clear at the time , he said , whether the suspect had a handgun or was trying to poke a hole in the boat 's cover . After a standoff , hostage negotiators persuaded him to surrender , Evans said .\nThe Tsarnaev family is from the Russian republic of Chechnya and fled the brutal wars there in the 1990s . The two brothers were born in Kyrgyzstan ; Dzhokhar became a U.S. citizen in 2012 . His brother was a legal U.S. resident .\nAlthough Tamerlan Tsarnaev had become increasingly radical in the past three or four years , there was no evidence Tuesday of any accomplices or connections to extremists , a U.S. official said .\nBut Dzhokhar Tsarnaev conveyed to authorities that his brother believed Islam is under attack and its adherents must fight back , a U.S. government source said Monday .\nCommunicating with investigators by writing and nodding , Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has indicated that his older brother masterminded the bombings , the source said .\nThe younger Tsarnaev has been charged with using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death , as well as one count of malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive device resulting in death .\nThe U.S. official said Tuesday that investigators have determined that the pressure cookers used in the attacks were purchased at a Macy 's department store .\nIn a statement issued through their lawyers Tuesday , the suspects ' sisters -- Ailina and Bella Tsarnaev -- said they were saddened `` to see so many innocent people hurt after such a callous act . ''\n`` As a family , we are absolutely devastated by the sense of loss and sorrow this has caused , '' they said . `` We do n't have any answers but we look forward to a thorough investigation and hope to learn more . ''\nAnd Tamerlan Tsarnaev 's wife , Katherine Russell , issued a statement through her attorney 's office saying she is `` doing everything she can to assist with the investigation '' and said she and her family are shocked and distraught .\n`` The reports of involvement by her husband and brother-in-law came as an absolute shock to them all , '' the statement said .\nThe suspects ' mother , Zubeidat Tsarnaev , said Tuesday that she believed her sons had been framed .\nSpeaking from her home in Dagestan -- a Russian republic on the Caspian Sea -- Tsarnaev said she thinks her older son died because he was a Muslim and charged that authorities silenced her younger son to prevent him from defending himself .\nShe said family members have arranged for Tamerlan Tsarnaev to be buried at a mosque in Cambridge , Massachusetts , Tuesday or Wednesday .\nAn official with the Islamic Society of Boston said it has not received any funeral requests from the family . A spokesman for the chief medical examiner 's office also said officials there have heard nothing about plans by the slain suspect 's family to claim his body .",

Hide Caption 15 of 15\n\nFamily, friends and colleagues mourned slain Massachusetts Institute of Technology police Officer Sean Collier at a private memorial service in Stoneham, Massachusetts, CNN affiliate WHDH reported.\n\nA memorial service open to law enforcement officers and the MIT community is scheduled for Wednesday on MIT's campus, the university said.\n\nNew details on officer's slaying\n\nCollier was killed Thursday night, near the beginning of a wild 24 hours that culminated in Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's capture in the backyard of a home in Watertown, a Boston suburb. Authorities suspect Tsarnaev and his 26-year-old brother of killing the officer, though Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has not been charged in Collier's death.\n\nAccording to a source with direct knowledge of the investigation, Collier didn't even have time to activate his emergency alert before being shot four or five times in the chest and head as he sat in his patrol car on the MIT campus.\n\nIt's not clear why the brothers allegedly ambushed the officer, the source said.\n\nThe source said investigators believe the Tsarnaevs then carjacked a black SUV, took the driver hostage and drove past the scene of the shooting before going to a gas station.\n\nCarjacking victim tells his story\n\nInvestigators believe Tamerlan Tsarnaev carried out the car jacking while his younger brother was nearby at the time, a U.S. official told CNN Tuesday.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with CNN affiliate WMUR, a man identifying himself as the carjacking victim said he was worried for his life.\n\n\"They asked me where I'm from. I told them I'm Chinese,\" WMUR quoted the man as saying. \"I was very scared. I asked them if they were going to hurt me. They said they won't hurt me. I was thinking, 'I think they will kill me later.' \"\n\nThe man escaped when the brothers stopped to fill up the gas tank, running for his life as one of the brothers swore at him, WMUR reported.\n\nSuspect shopped at fireworks store\n\nMore than two months before the marathon bombings, Tamerlan Tsarnaev bought two reloadable mortar style fireworks a New Hampshire store.\n\nOn February 6, Tsarnaev had one question for a store assistant at Phantom Fireworks in Seabrook, New Hampshire: \"What's the biggest and loudest thing you have?\"\n\nAfter that, store Vice President William Weimer said, Tsarnaev shelled out $200 cash for two \"lock and load kits.\"\n\nWeimer said such behavior is very common in the store. He said the store notified the FBI after discovering that the marathon bombing suspect had bought explosives there.\n\nLaw enforcement officials told CNN earlier Tuesday that the number of fireworks bought at the store was not enough to set off explosions the size of those at the Boston Marathon.\n\n\"My assumption is they bought this, experimented with it and decided against it and moved on and found another source,\" Weimer said.\n\nDetails emerge about boat, standoff\n\nTamerlan Tsarnaev was pronounced dead early Friday. On Friday night, police captured Dzhokhar Tsarnaev hiding inside a boat in a backyard.\n\nBoat owner David Henneberry told CNN affiliate WCVB Tuesday that his obsession with how his boat was stored just right led him to discover the suspect as he stood on a ladder replacing two pads that had fallen out of the shrink wrap protecting his boat for the winter.\n\n\"I got three steps up the ladder and rolled the shrink wrap. I didn't expect to see anything, but I saw blood on the floor of the boat. A good amount of blood. ... And I looked back and forth a couple of times and my eyes went to the engine block and there was a body,\" he told the affiliate.\n\nHenneberry said Tuesday that he doesn't even remember climbing down the ladder and running to the phone to dial 911, delivering the tip that would lead to Tsarnaev's capture.\n\n\"I didn't waste any time. I didn't ask him if he wanted a cup of coffee. I was off that ladder. That is all I remember,\" he told the affiliate.\n\nInvestigators swarmed the scene, forming a perimeter. Multiple shots rang out from behind the house, Boston Police Superintendent William Evans said Tuesday.\n\nAuthorities are still investigating whether Tsarnaev was armed and whether a shootout occurred at the boat, Evans told reporters.\n\n\"Clearly from everybody's vantage point, we could see whoever was in that boat was poking at that top,\" he said.\n\nIt wasn't clear at the time, he said, whether the suspect had a handgun or was trying to poke a hole in the boat's cover. After a standoff, hostage negotiators persuaded him to surrender, Evans said.\n\nInvestigation continues\n\nThe Tsarnaev family is from the Russian republic of Chechnya and fled the brutal wars there in the 1990s. The two brothers were born in Kyrgyzstan; Dzhokhar became a U.S. citizen in 2012. His brother was a legal U.S. resident.\n\nAlthough Tamerlan Tsarnaev had become increasingly radical in the past three or four years , there was no evidence Tuesday of any accomplices or connections to extremists, a U.S. official said.\n\nBut Dzhokhar Tsarnaev conveyed to authorities that his brother believed Islam is under attack and its adherents must fight back, a U.S. government source said Monday.\n\nCommunicating with investigators by writing and nodding, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has indicated that his older brother masterminded the bombings, the source said.\n\nThe younger Tsarnaev has been charged with using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death, as well as one count of malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive device resulting in death.\n\nThe U.S. official said Tuesday that investigators have determined that the pressure cookers used in the attacks were purchased at a Macy's department store.\n\nSuspects' family members react\n\nIn a statement issued through their lawyers Tuesday, the suspects' sisters -- Ailina and Bella Tsarnaev -- said they were saddened \"to see so many innocent people hurt after such a callous act.\"\n\n\"As a family, we are absolutely devastated by the sense of loss and sorrow this has caused,\" they said. \"We don't have any answers but we look forward to a thorough investigation and hope to learn more.\"\n\nAnd Tamerlan Tsarnaev's wife, Katherine Russell, issued a statement through her attorney's office saying she is \"doing everything she can to assist with the investigation\" and said she and her family are shocked and distraught.\n\n\"The reports of involvement by her husband and brother-in-law came as an absolute shock to them all,\" the statement said.\n\nThe suspects' mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaev, said Tuesday that she believed her sons had been framed.\n\nSpeaking from her home in Dagestan -- a Russian republic on the Caspian Sea -- Tsarnaev said she thinks her older son died because he was a Muslim and charged that authorities silenced her younger son to prevent him from defending himself.\n\nShe said family members have arranged for Tamerlan Tsarnaev to be buried at a mosque in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Tuesday or Wednesday.\n\nAn official with the Islamic Society of Boston said it has not received any funeral requests from the family. A spokesman for the chief medical examiner's office also said officials there have heard nothing about plans by the slain suspect's family to claim his body.",
