To be clear , this legislation has little to no chance of passing the Republican-controlled Senate or being signed by President Donald Trump . Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell already bluntly stated , \u201c That \u2019 s not going to go anywhere . \u201d\nBut by making anti-corruption their No . 1 priority , House Democrats are throwing down the gauntlet for Republicans . A vast majority of Americans want to get the influence of money out of politics , and want Congress to pass laws to do so . New polling from the PAC End Citizens United found 82 percent of all voters and 84 percent of independents said they support a bill of reforms to tackle corruption .\nGiven how popular the issue is , and Trump \u2019 s multitude of scandals , it looks bad for Republicans to be the party opposing campaign finance reform \u2014 especially going into 2020 .\n\u201c Our best friend in this debate is the public , \u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters recently . \u201c We believe it will have great support . \u201d\nThe issue is being spearheaded by Maryland Rep. John Sarbanes , a longtime advocate of campaign finance reform who has disavowed corporate PAC money for years . Sarbanes and other House Democrats have been working with progressive heavy hitters in the Senate including Massachusetts Sen.

Here \u2019 s the important part of each section .\nPublic financing of campaigns , powered by small donations . Under Sarbanes \u2019 s vision , the federal government would provide a voluntary 6-1 match for candidates for president and Congress , which means for every dollar a candidate raises from small donations , the federal government would match it six times over . The maximum small donation that could be matched would be capped at $ 200 . \u201c If you give $ 100 to a candidate that \u2019 s meeting those requirements , then that candidate would get another $ 600 coming in behind them , \u201d Sarbanes told \u2588\u2588\u2588 this summer . \u201c The evidence and the modeling is that most candidates can do as well or better in terms of the dollars they raise if they step into this new system . \u201d\n\u201c If you give $ 100 to a candidate that \u2019 s meeting those requirements , then that candidate would get another $ 600 coming in behind them , \u201d Sarbanes told \u2588\u2588\u2588 this summer . \u201c The evidence and the modeling is that most candidates can do as well or better in terms of the dollars they raise if they step into this new system. \u201d Support for a constitutional amendment to end Citizens United .\nPassing the DISCLOSE Act , pushed by Rep.
