    "content": "The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia has bestowed its blessing on cancel culture\u2013the twisted phenomenon whereby universities and public libraries cancel scheduled events just because someone claims to be offended . In Nova Scotia , cancel culture has spread to personalized license plates . Justice Darlene Jamieson ruled on January 31 , 2020 , that one anonymous complaint about Lorne Grabher \u2019 s personalized \u201c GRABHER \u201d license plate was enough to warrant its permanent cancellation . The Court affirmed the January 2017 decision to cancel the plate which the Grabher family had used for over 25 years , because Mr. Grabher \u2019 s surname could be \u201c misinterpreted \u201d as a \u201c socially unacceptable slogan . \u201d\nLorne Grabher is of Austrian-German heritage . His family immigrated to Canada from Europe in 1906 . His father served in the Canadian Armed Forces , and was stationed in Cape Breton , Nova Scotia . The family \u2019 s history , including their name and the heritage it signifies , is important to the Grabher family . In or around 1990 the Grabher family applied for the \u201c GRABHER \u201d plate , originally a gift to Lorne \u2019 s father and later used by Lorne \u2019 s son . For 27 consecutive years , through three generations of Grabhers , the Registrar authorized the plate for use on the family \u2019 s motor vehicles in Nova Scotia . Each year the Registrar of Motor Vehicles renewed the plate without issue .\nAll it took to wreck this noble family tradition was one anonymous complaint to the Registrar , in October of 2016 . Without taking into account the Grabher family \u2019 s pride in its Austrian-German heritage , and ignoring all prior decisions to renew the plate year after year after year , Janice Harland of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles told Lorne Grabher : \u201c While I recognize this plate was issued as your last name , the public can not be expected to know this and can misinterpret it as a socially unacceptable slogan . \u201d\nFor Lorne Grabher , this case is about more than a personalized plate . It \u2019 s about his family \u2019 s name , personal dignity , and the ongoing insult by the Nova Scotia government in its censorship of the plate .\nJustice Darlene Jamieson has effectively equated Lorne Grabher \u2019 s surname with EATASS , FOQME , HOTCOK , BLOWJB , BRDSHT , FSTFK , FCKPIG , 8CUNT , DCHBAG , GNGBNG , FQUALL and other objectionable terms on the Banned List of words that are prohibited by the Nova Scotia Registrar of Motor Vehicles . The court was not moved by the double standard of foul language used by another government entity , the Halifax Water Board , whose bus ads included the phrases \u201c Powerful Sh * t \u201d and \u201c Be proud of your Dingle. \u201d The court also deemed irrelevant the existence of Canadian place names like \u201c Dildo , Newfoundland , \u201d \u201c Swastika , Ontario , \u201d \u201c Red Indian Lake , Newfoundland , \u201d \u201c Crotch Lake , Ontario , \u201d \u201c Old Squaw Islands , Nunavut , \u201d and \u201c Cape Negro \u201d in Nova Scotia .\nJustice Jamieson relied heavily on a report by Carrie Rentschler ( https : //www.mcgill.ca/ahcs/people-contacts/faculty/rentschler ) a McGill University professor of \u201c feminist media studies \u201d who specializes in things like \u201c the construction of new political subjectivities , \u201d \u201c emergent forms of social collectivity , \u201d and \u201c the shape and practice of contemporary feminisms in social media networks and hashtag publics . \u201d\nProfessor Rentschler argued that the \u201c GRABHER \u201d license plate supports or increases violence against women ; that exposure to cultural slogans normalizes sexual violence against women ; that Mr. Grabher \u2019 s plate creates an elevated risk of rape ; and that Mr. Grabher \u2019 s surname is a statement in support of physical violence against women . As the Professor explains in her revised report :\n\u201c As an expression , the meaning of \u2018 Grabher \u2019 could be understood to signify the support , condoning and encouragement of gendered physical violence against girls and women . \u2018 Grabher \u2019 \u2013 read as \u2018 Grab her \u2019 - is a speech act that can potentially contribute to the harms of gendered violence against girls and women , \u2018 crossing over from expressive activity to threat \u2019 \u2026 As an injunction , recipients of the phrase may interpret it as encouragement to grab or grope female individuals without their consent . \u201d\nThere was no evidence before the court that there is less crime in Nova Scotia , or in Mr. Grabher \u2019 s neighborhood , since the plate was revoked . There was no evidence that anyone , including the anonymous complainant , had suffered any harm as a result of the plate .\nProfessor Rentschler claimed that Mr. Grabher \u2019 s plate is broadly \u201c offensive \u201d to the public , but provided no examples of any specific people or studies who find it so . Professor Rentschler is not from Nova Scotia , admitting on cross-examination that she did not know the name of the big blue ship in the background on all Nova Scotia licence plates . She provided no evidence to support her claim that the plate endangers the general public . Nor did the Nova Scotia government present any evidence to support any of Professor Renstchler \u2019 s assertions . There was no evidence that any roadway or motorist or citizen , female or male , was ever once endangered by the plate . There was therefore no evidence that the plate represents \u201c language that supports gendered violence \u201d or that the \u201c plate promotes violence against women . \u201d\nDespite the absence of evidence to support Professor Rentschler \u2019 s wild claims , Justice Jamieson actually agreed with her , ruling that \u201c the seven letters \u2018 GRABHER , \u2019 without added context to indicate this is a surname , could be interpreted as promoting sexualized violence against women and girls . \u201d\nJustice Jamieson decreed that banning Mr. Grabher \u2019 s plate is justified to prevent harm , to ensure a \u201c safe and welcoming \u201d environment on Nova Scotia roads , and to protect individuals in society from the effects of offensive expression . She stated : \u201c Clearly the provincial government can not sanction having vehicles with government-owned plates travelling the highways of this province and country bearing messages that could be considered \u2018 offensive or not in good taste \u2019 . \u201d\nWhere would we be without the government to keep us safe from the scourge of peoples \u2019 offensive surnames ?\nWhat actual harm Mr. Grabher \u2019 s personalized plate had caused from 1990 to 2017 was not explained by the Court , nor could the Registrar of Motor Vehicles point to any harm . The Nova Scotia government suggested the GRABHER plate hurt tourism , but the government \u2019 s witness , Peter Hackett , later admitted that there was no such evidence .\nThe Registrar provided no evidence on behalf of the person who complained , why that person complained , or even whether she or he resided in Nova Scotia . The Registrar treated an ethnically German name as an English phrase , and then attached an idiosyncratic and demeaning reading to it . Mr. Grabher \u2019 s claim of discrimination against Canadians of Austrian-German heritage was dismissed because , according to Justice Jamieson , persons of Austrian-German heritage do not suffer from any \u201c pre-existing disadvantage or stereotyping in Canadian society. \u201d Essentially : discrimination is only wrong if you belong to the right group .\nThe court minimized the hurt and humiliation experienced by Mr. Grabher in the past three years , claiming that he is \u201c free \u201d to \u201c choose another personalized plate consisting of up to seven letters or numbers . As Justice Jamieson explained it : \u201c He is not denied access to personalized plates , but solely access to the seven-letter , personalized \u201c GRABHER \u201d plate. \u201d This \u201c freedom \u201d is rather worthless because no other expression on the plate would communicate the same idea as the family surname . If you can not say what you want , there is no free expression . For a court to say \u201c no worries , you are allowed to say other things \u201d misses the whole point of free expression .\nCancel culture panders to the fragile snowflakes who file anonymous complaints . Their desire , to avoid feeling offended by their own imagination about what someone else \u2019 s last name could mean if translated into a different language and then distorted into something it is not , must take precedence over someone else \u2019 s right to display his own last name with pride .\nWhen courts promote cancel culture , they harm the free society .",
