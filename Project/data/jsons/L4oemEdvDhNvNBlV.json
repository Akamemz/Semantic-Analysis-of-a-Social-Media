But they build their campaigns on a common bedrock \u2013 rejection of the establishment and ruling elites that have led European nations into their current difficulties.\n\nIn most places, European populists play the nationalist card, blaming supra-national EU institutions for the continent\u2019s problems and calling for a return to full sovereignty within national borders. Many national government leaders have unwittingly given such arguments extra momentum by taking credit for things that go well, but blaming Brussels for things that go badly.\n\n\u201cAnti-establishment rhetoric mobilizes a unique set of voters, and then populists can combine it with other ideological positions\u201d with local appeal, says Bert Bakker, who studies far-right movements at the University of Amsterdam. [Editor's note: The original version misspelled Mr. Bakker's surname.]\n\nIn Germany, for example, where the EU remains popular among most Germans, the populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has focused on the problems caused by Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s willingness to allow more than a million refugees into the country.\n\nIn France, where voters have traditionally sought comfort in a strong state, Ms. Le Pen\u2019s party advocates nationalizing troubled industries and strongly opposes the sort of austerity policies that both the center-left and center-right parties have adopted.\n\nIn the Netherlands, Mr.Wilders has focused on what he calls \u201cde-Islamizing\u201d the country. A one-page manifesto he released earlier this year calls for the closure of all refugee centers, mosques, and Islamic schools, and for a ban on the Koran.\n\nOne common thread \u2013 and one that links European populist leaders not only with each other but also with Trump \u2013 is an admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, supplanting Europe\u2019s traditionally close ties with Washington by a new relationship with Moscow.\n\nTrump has often voiced his disdain for the EU, but since winning the election he has gone out of his way to thumb his nose at Brussels. The first foreign politician he met was Nigel Farage, the veteran British anti-EU campaigner, and he has invited to Washington Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, who has made himself a pariah in Europe by repeatedly scorning \u201cEuropean values.\u201d [Editor's note: The original version misidentified Mr. Orb\u00e1n's office.]\n\nNo counter-programming \u2013 yet\n\nThe various strains of European right-wing populism blend into a style of ethno-nationalism that has so shocked and surprised the traditional political establishment that little thinking has yet gone into how the trend might be countered.\n\n\u201cThe perception that this is not business as usual is there, but the ability to translate that into political priorities is not there,\u201d says Mr. Monti, who was an EU commissioner for a decade before becoming Italy\u2019s prime minister.\n\nMonti fears that Europe\u2019s traditional ruling political parties on the center-left and center-right are condemning themselves \u2013 and the European Union \u2013 to death unless they stop undermining the EU by blaming Brussels for their own faults. \u201cThey feel the pinch of populists and respond by imitating their approach and language,\u201d he says.\n\nThat risks lending legitimacy to the populists\u2019 arguments, worries Ralf Melzer, an expert on far-right groups with the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, the German Social Democratic party\u2019s think tank. Instead, he argues, \u201cwe have to revitalize pro-European discourse, and spread the knowledge that immigration has positive contributions to make to society.\u201d\n\nThat may be the case, but it is likely to go unheeded for the time being, says Sanders, who surveyed European \u201cauthoritarian populist\u201d trends.\n\n\u201cThe liberal establishment in Europe has made the same errors\u201d as its American counterpart, he suggests. \u201cWhen we talk about immigration we talk about its economic benefits, not its social consequences,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to start rebuilding communities to challenge the feeling that \u2018it doesn\u2019t feel like home around here anymore\u2019 that some folk on the front lines have.\u201d\n\nThat would have the merit of showing that someone in authority is listening, agrees Professor Berman.\n\nTaking it seriously\n\nIn the long term, she believes, only a fairer way of sharing the fruits of economic growth will coax angry and alienated voters back to the political center. In the meantime, for a start, it would help if immigration were better controlled \u201cto allow time for people to adjust.\u201d\n\nMs. Merkel seems to have got that message.
