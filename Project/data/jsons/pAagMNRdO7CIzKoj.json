The swiftness of the Obama campaign \u2019 s attack , calling in Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards to criticize Mr. Romney , underscored the concern in the president \u2019 s camp about the shifting attitudes of female voters since the first presidential debate on Oct. 3 , in which the president performed poorly .\nViewers of the debate rated Mr. Romney as the undisputed winner , and even some single women , who make up a key part of the president \u2019 s support , favored the Republican .
