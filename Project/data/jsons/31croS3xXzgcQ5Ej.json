Pair that with an end to the Medicaid expansion , and Kentucky stood to lose more than $ 40 billion over 10 years , with a corresponding loss of coverage , according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis . ( KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation . )\nWith Congress poised to convene in September , it remains unclear whether McConnell will try again to repeal Obamacare or shrink Medicaid , after several failed attempts . But perhaps a more fundamental question is whether Republican politicians who tried\u2014and may try again\u2014to take away often vital health care benefits from their voters will pay a political price .\nAmy McGrath , a former Marine fighter pilot , wants to extract just such a price in McConnell \u2019 s backyard . The Democrat is trying to recapture a House seat that flipped in 2012 . Her two-minute campaign launch video\u2014one minute on war and determination , the other on health care and her mom \u2019 s legacy\u2014went viral with more than 1.3 million views in two weeks .\nFormer Kentucky governor Steve Beshear and other Democrats see Republicans potentially getting trapped between their anti-Obamacare rhetoric and the reality of improved health coverage .\n\u201c Trump came along , and his basic message was , \u2018 Do you want this horrible Obamacare , or do you want something better , less expensive , more coverage , more people covered ? \u2019 You know , offering them the moon , \u201d said Beshear . \u201c Of course everybody said , \u2018 Oh , I \u2019 ll take the moon . \u2019 \u201d\nIn town hall meetings this summer , many congressional Republicans did hear loudly from constituents who would be hurt by repeal of the health law and who seem aware that \u201c the moon \u201d is no longer on offer as a replacement . All versions of the Republican bills would take coverage away from more than 20 million people and raise premium costs for most people .\nFor her part , Petrucci wasn \u2019 t thinking much about health care during the campaign . As a veteran , she liked Trump for his pledge to restore the military .\nSince the election , though , two things changed for her . Her stepson , Braden , came to live with her and her husband in the spring\u2014a transition that left the boy with a three-month gap in his Medicaid coverage due to a bureaucratic error . Then McConnell came just one vote shy last month in his bid to start carrying out Trump \u2019 s repeal of Obamacare . It was frightening when she realized how much Braden depended on Medicaid .\n\u201c I guess my view on everything changed when it happened to me , \u201d Petrucci said . Other reporting from the state finds Trump voters who benefited from the Affordable Care Act have similar concerns\u2014but may not change their votes .\nBeshear led one of the nation \u2019 s most successful rollouts of Obamacare coverage in 2014 by uniting the new insurance marketplace and the state \u2019 s Medicaid expansion under the umbrella of a health care exchange called Kynect .\nYet current Republican Gov . Matt Bevin campaigned in 2015 on ending Obamacare . He abandoned Beshear \u2019 s unified approach and shuttered Kynect , which excelled technologically as other states \u2019 exchanges stumbled badly . He shifted the 81,000 Kentuckians who bought subsidized insurance there to the federal government \u2019 s healthcare.gov marketplace .\nBut , as Bevin discovered , actual repeal is unappealing . Within days of taking office , he backed off his campaign pledge to roll back the Medicaid expansion that benefited 600,000 residents .\nPart of the reason people in Kentucky were hostile to the ACA , even as they were benefiting from it , was branding . The ACA , like the popular Children \u2019 s Health Insurance Program , gave states the option to put their own stamp on the law . Kentucky was the only Southern state that chose to do so\u2014and Kynect became one of the ACA \u2019 s most successful brands .\n\u201c A lot of people didn \u2019 t understand that the coverage they had gotten was Obamacare , \u201d said Rep. John Yarmuth , the Democratic congressman who represents the Louisville area . \u201c So when Bevin said , \u2018 I \u2019 m going to do away with Obamacare , \u2019 they didn \u2019 t realize that it was taking their coverage away . Now they know all of that . \u201d\nYet Trump and congressional Republicans are still looking for a way to repeal Obamacare . They say it is what people want them to do .\nFor people like Pipes , Petrucci , and Louisville resident Allison Swearingin , it \u2019 s obvious what is at stake . Swearingin has extremely painful psoriatic arthritis . Like the majority of Americans , Swearingin had insurance through her job , and the ACA initially had little impact on her life . She opposed the law . But when she left her last job , she needed to buy insurance through Kynect .\n\u201c There were a lot of things I didn \u2019 t think of before . It was all my own ignorance for why I was against it , \u201d Swearingin said . \u201c If I could look back at myself , I would smack myself and say , \u2018 You \u2019 re stupid . \u2019 \u201d\nThe simple fact that most Kentuckians\u2014and most Americans\u2014get insurance through work insulates Republican lawmakers from possible anger . In Kentucky , about 45 percent of the state \u2019 s 4.4 million residents get their insurance through work . Another 1.4 million rely on Medicaid .\n\u201c Until [ voters ] start feeling the pinch , all these debates about what a proposal might do tend to be temporary , \u201d said Stephen Voss , a political scientist at the University of Kentucky . \u201c When it doesn \u2019 t actually happen , usually voters will move on . \u201d\nFor McConnell , backlash against the repeal push is perhaps more a national concern than a local one . At home , observers and even Democrats doubt he , in the Senate since 1985 , would pay a price . Dewey Clayton , a politics professor at the University of Louisville , said McConnell , 75 , is probably safe until he decides to retire .\n\u201c McConnell has a way of outmaneuvering [ opponents ] even when it looks like there \u2019 s no way , \u201d Clayton said . \u201c There are so many other issues out here , and he \u2019 s such a shrewd politician . \u201d\nDemocrats think the repeal push could damage the GOP . But Yarmuth , who has known McConnell since the late \u2019 60s , said the current result\u2014where McConnell tried and fell one vote short\u2014is actually just about perfect for him .\n\u201c The worst thing you can do is hang a bill with 20 percent maximum support around your members \u2019 necks , \u201d Yarmuth said , referring to polling data that finds all the proposed repeal bills deeply unpopular . \u201c So I don \u2019 t really think he wants a bill . \u201d\nMcConnell \u2019 s office did not respond to requests for comment for this story .\nThe attempts at repeal appear to have harmed the re-election prospects of two Senate Republicans in swing states , Jeff Flake in Arizona and Dean Heller in Nevada . McConnell can afford to lose only two members of his 52-member caucus and still keep the majority , but in the next election , there are 10 Democrats facing races in states that Trump won .\n\u201c I think [ McConnell ] feels that the odds of the Republicans keeping control of the Senate in 2018 are pretty good , so he was willing to roll the dice and gamble on even losing a couple , \u201d said Beshear . \u201c His top priority is to be Senate majority leader , period . I mean , period . Forget about his constituency , forget about Americans , forget about anything . \u201d\nIn some ways , the failed repeal vote could actually help McConnell .\n\u201c He had to try , he had to show the right-wing Republicans who were blaming McConnell for not getting what they were demanding , \u2018 Face reality , folks ; we can \u2019 t pass this , \u201d Voss said . \u201c Instead of them having to believe McConnell , they \u2019 ve got it all on paper .
