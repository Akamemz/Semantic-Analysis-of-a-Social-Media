Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) July 12 , 2020\nTrump \u2019 s tweet , however , is belied by actions his administration has taken to support the wall \u2019 s builder .\nThe administration gave Fisher the billion-dollar contract in May to build additional stretches of the wall in Arizona , despite a lawsuit around the South Texas project and an ongoing audit by the Pentagon \u2019 s inspector general of a previous border wall contract that is looking into possible \u201c inappropriate influence . \u201d\nOn Sunday , the congressman who called for the audit responded to the president \u2019 s tweet .\n\u201c The President isn \u2019 t telling the truth again .

There is no reason for construction to continue during a pandemic . \u201d\nThe Army Corps of Engineers has said Fisher won the federal contract to build a segment of the border fence in Arizona because it was the lowest bid .\nU.S. Attorney Ryan Patrick of the Southern District of Texas called the private wall a \u201c vanity project \u2019 and a \u201c scam . \u201d\nHis office sued Fisher Sand and Gravel , its subsidiaries , and We Build the Wall on behalf of the International Boundary and Water Commission , to stop it from building the fence until it submitted a detailed engineering study to determine its impact on the flow of the Rio Grande and nearby properties . The commission is a binational body that regulates development in the floodplain between the U.S. and Mexico to ensure boundary treaties aren \u2019 t violated .\n\u201c We already owned the land a few hundred yards from the river and it cut the peninsula instead of following the river , \u201d Patrick tweeted Sunday . \u201c We said it was too close to the water , erosion would be an issue , the location made no sense , etc . Now we risk the thing falling down in a big storm/flood . \u201d\nSix engineering and hydrology experts consulted by \u2588\u2588\u2588 and The Texas Tribune said that it was concerning to see the level of erosion around the fence so soon after construction and that it shouldn \u2019 t have been built so close to the river .\nJust months after the wall went up , the experts said photos reveal a series of gashes and gullies at various points along the structure where rainwater runoff has scoured the sandy loam beneath the foundation .\nFisher disagreed with the experts , saying that it \u2019 s surface erosion where grass that was planted took longer to grow , but that it doesn \u2019 t compromise either the fence or the adjacent road . He said he hoped Trump could personally see what they \u2019 ve built .\nOn Wednesday , U.S. District Judge Randy Crane instructed attorneys to work out details of the inspection and to come to an agreement about the remediation and fixes for a part of the fence that violates a treaty with Mexico by deflecting too much water during floods .\nIn total , Fisher has secured $ 1.7 billion in federal contracts since December . Soon after the 2016 election , Fisher became a frequent guest on Fox News and other conservative media , where he caught the attention of Trump . Last year , The Washington Post reported that the president \u201c latch ( ed ) on \u201d to Fisher \u2019 s claims of speed and quality and \u201c aggressively pushed \u201d for the firm in conversations with top Homeland Security officials .\nFisher was also aided by a close relationship with freshman U.S. Sen. Kevin Cramer , R-N.D. , who advocated for the company with Trump and Trump \u2019 s son-in-law , Jared Kushner .

Initially , the idea was to give the funds to the federal government , but when that wasn \u2019 t legally possible , the group shifted its mission to helping the administration build the fence using private companies .\nSo far , it has worked on two fence projects , a half-mile stretch in New Mexico outside El Paso , completely funded by We Build the Wall and constructed by Fisher \u2019 s company , and in the Rio Grande Valley city of Mission . In Texas , We Build the Wall donated only $ 1.5 million , with Fisher putting in the rest of the $ 42 million project .\nIn this part of Texas , the government normally builds miles inland , on top of a levee system , in part because of flooding concerns .
