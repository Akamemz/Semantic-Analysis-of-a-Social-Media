When I got to the top of the stairs , I was pushed from behind into a bedroom across from the bathroom . I couldn \u2019 t see who pushed me . Brett and Mark came into the bedroom and locked the door behind them . There was music playing in the bedroom . It was turned up louder by either Brett or Mark once we were in the room . I was pushed onto the bed and Brett got on top of me . He began running his hands over my body and grinding into me . I believed he was going to rape me . I tried to yell for help . When I did , Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from yelling . This is what terrified me the most and has had the most lasting impact on my life . It was hard for me to breathe , and I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me. \u201d \u201c Dr . Ford , with what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you ? \u201d \u201c One hundred percent. \u201d \u201c What is the strongest memory you have ? \u201d \u201c Indelible in the hippocampus is the laughter \u2014 the uproarious laughter between the two , and they \u2019 re having fun at my expense. \u201d \u201c You \u2019 ve never forgotten that laughter , never forgotten them laughing at you ? \u201d \u201c I was underneath one of them while the two laughed \u2014 two friends having a really good time with one another. \u201d \u201c Are you aware that the three people at the party besides yourself and Brett Kavanaugh have given statements under penalty of felony to the committee ? \u201d \u201c Yes. \u201d \u201c And are you aware of what those statements say ? \u201d \u201c Yes. \u201d \u201c Are you aware that they say that they have no memory or knowledge of such a party ? \u201d \u201c I don \u2019 t expect that P.J . and Leland would remember this evening . It was a very unremarkable party . It was not one of their more notorious parties . Because nothing remarkable happened to them that evening \u2014 they were downstairs . And Mr. Judge is a different story \u2014 I would expect that he would remember that this happened. \u201d \u201c I categorically and unequivocally deny the allegation against me by Dr. Ford . This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit , fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election , fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record , revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside , left-wing opposition groups . The other night , Ashley and my daughter Liza said their prayers . And little Liza , all of 10 years old , said to Ashley , we should pray for the woman. \u201d \u201c Was there ever a time when you drink so much that you couldn \u2019 t remember what happened or part of what happened the night before ? \u201d \u201c I \u2013 no . I remember what happened . And , I think you \u2019 ve probably had beers , Senator , and so \u2014 \u201d \u201c So you \u2019 re saying there \u2019 s never been a case where you drank so much that you didn \u2019 t remember what happened the night before , or part of what happened ? \u201d \u201c That \u2019 s \u2014 you \u2019 re asking about yeah , blackout . I don \u2019 t know , have you ? \u201d \u201c Could you answer the question , Judge ? And just \u2014 so you \u2014 that \u2019 s not happened ? Is that your answer ? \u201d \u201c Yeah , and I \u2019 m curious if you have. \u201d \u201c I have no drinking problem , Judge. \u201d \u201c Yeah , nor do I. \u201d \u201c O.K. , thank you. \u201d \u201c In your yearbook , you talked about drinking and sexual exploits , did you not ? \u201d \u201c Senator , let me take a step back and explain high school . I was No . 1 in the class , freshman \u2014 \u201d \u201c And I thought \u2014 \u201d \u201c No , no , no , no , no , no , no , no. \u201d \u201c I thought only the Senate could filibuster. \u201d \u201c I \u2019 m going to talk about my high school \u2014 \u201d \u201c I thought only the Senate could filibuster. \u201d \u201c No , no , I \u2019 m going to talk \u2014 \u201d \u201c Let him answer. \u201d \u201c I \u2019 m going to talk about my high school record if you \u2019 re going to sit here and mock me. \u201d \u201c You said , \u2018 I welcome any kind of investigation. \u2019 I quote you . \u2018 I welcome any kind of investigation. \u2019 \u201d \u201c I welcome whatever the committee wants to do , because I \u2019 m telling the truth. \u201d \u201c I want to know what you want to do. \u201d \u201c I \u2019 m telling the truth. \u201d \u201c I want to know what you want to do , Judge. \u201d \u201c I \u2019 m innocent . I \u2019 m innocent of this charge. \u201d \u201c Then you \u2019 re prepared for an F.B.I . investigation ? \u201d \u201c They don \u2018 t reach conclusions . You reach the conclusions , Senator. \u201c \u201c No , but they do investigate questions. \u201d \u201c If you wanted an F.B.I . investigation , you could \u2019 ve come to us . What you want to do is destroy this guy \u2019 s life , hold this seat open and hope you win in 2020 . You said that , not me . You \u2019 ve got nothing to apologize for . When you see Sotomayor and Kagan , tell him that Lindsey said hello . Because I voted for them . I would never do to them what you \u2019 ve done to this guy . This is the most unethical sham since I \u2019 ve been in politics . And if you really wanted to know the truth , you sure as hell wouldn \u2019 t have done what you \u2019 ve done to this guy .
