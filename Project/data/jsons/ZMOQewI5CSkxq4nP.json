Complaints such as those offered by Cooper and others come , more or less , from the same genre , even if the particular grievances have varied .\nI am not entirely unsympathetic to their frustration : The Constitution is not like the Ten Commandments , handed down from God almighty . It is a document written by flawed humans that can , and often should , be critiqued . The Framers themselves acknowledged their own fallibility by including an amendment process .\nNevertheless , I think polemical calls to action such as this tend to dismiss out of hand the unique democratic theory underlying our system of government . In its place , they rely upon an undue confidence in the wisdom and virtue of numerical majorities .\nThere is admittedly a deep irony embedded in our constitutional order . By calling for public ratification of the Constitution , the Framers created a pristinely republican moment \u2014 one when the people alone would endorse the means by which they would be ruled . But in so doing , they erected a structure that has proven exceedingly difficult for subsequent generations to alter , let along tear down , leading to a \u201c dead hand \u201d of control that is not terribly republican . If our nation is a republic , it is one where the generation of 1787\u201388 continues to exercise significant authority over us .\nOf the Founders , Thomas Jefferson was the most sensitive of this , which is why he promoted the radical notion of periodic constitutional conventions .

James Madison , on the other hand , was a skeptic of this notion . As he wrote in Federalist No . 49 :\nNotwithstanding the success which has attended the revisions of our established forms of government , and which does so much honor to the virtue and intelligence of the people of America , it must be confessed that the experiments are of too ticklish a nature to be unnecessarily multiplied .\nThis is not merely Burkean prudence \u2014 don \u2019 t go unnecessarily upending existing forms of government \u2014 though it is certainly that . It also reflects a skepticism about the capacity of the public to rule , Madison \u2019 s compliment about their \u201c virtue and intelligence \u201d notwithstanding . There is , Madison reckoned , a lot to fear from majoritarian government . A numerical majority , after all , possesses no inherently normative authority .

Majorities can be factional \u2014 out for their own good rather than the good of the whole nation . Majority factions are the fatal disease of democratic government .\nOur system of government , then , is best understood as one of mediated majority rule .
