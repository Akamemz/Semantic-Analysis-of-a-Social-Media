What do you say to the millions of Americans who might have jobs today if you had made the 2009 stimulus package bigger, as many leading liberal economists argued it should have been. You came to office promising bold action, and in the eyes of many of your supporters, blinked \u2014 with devastating effects on the economy.\n\nThis is a hope-and-change meets reality question, and Obama could decide to blame Republicans, as he has throughout the campaign. But Obama has some reasons to take credit for a legitimate accomplishment early in his first term.\n\nMany economists agree that his $787 billion stimulus package \u2014 Obama\u2019s first big achievement as president \u2014 helped save the economy from imploding. What it didn\u2019t do was create a robust recovery, and the country will be shaking off that hangover for years to come.\n\nNor did the stimulus dramatically decrease the unemployment rate as Obama\u2019s advisers predicted, though, and stimulus has become a dirty word for most Americans.\n\nLiberals in Obama\u2019s own administration pressured the president to go bigger, and pumping more money in might have given the economy a bigger boost \u2014 or lessened the long-term pain. If Obama believes the stimulus worked, then wouldn\u2019t a bigger stimulus have worked better?\n\nObama had the congressional majorities to make it happen, but he offered a smaller compromise number in part to win Republican votes. Ultimately, every House Republican voted against the $787 billion number. So it seems like maybe the compromise wasn\u2019t worth it.\n\n2. Washington seems as toxic today as it was the day you took office. The country was looking to you to unite it, and you yourself admitted recently that you failed. In retrospect, do you feel you overestimated your own ability to bridge divides in Washington, and how do you answer people who say simply: Obama let me down?\n\nIt might be hard for the president to confront the ghost of Obama past, and any answer that comes down to \u201cIt\u2019s all the Republicans\u2019 fault\u201d might sound defensive and tinny. But that\u2019s where the president tends to go.\n\n\u201cObviously, the fact that we haven\u2019t been able to change the tone in Washington is disappointing,\u201d Obama said at the Univision town hall in Florida. \u201cWe know now that as soon as I came into office, you already had meetings among some of our Republican colleagues saying, \u2018How do we figure out how to beat the president?\u2019 And I think that I\u2019ve learned some lessons over the last four years, and the most important lesson I\u2019ve learned is that you can\u2019t change Washington from the inside.
