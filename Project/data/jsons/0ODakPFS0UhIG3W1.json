    "content": "What we just witnessed in Cleveland and Philadelphia defies our normal political vocabulary . We are used to speaking of American politics as split between the two major parties . It \u2019 s Democrats versus Republicans , liberals versus conservatives , left versus right .\nBut not this election . The conventions showed that this is something different . This campaign is not merely a choice between the Democratic and Republican parties , but between a normal political party and an abnormal one .\nThe Democratic Party \u2019 s convention was a normal political party \u2019 s convention . The party nominated Hillary Clinton , a longtime party member with deep experience in government . Clinton was endorsed by Bernie Sanders , the runner-up in the primary . Barack Obama , the sitting president , spoke in favor of Clinton . Various Democratic luminaries gave speeches endorsing Clinton by name . The assembled speakers criticized the other party \u2019 s nominee , arguing that he would be a bad president and should be defeated at the polls .\nThat isn \u2019 t to say that Democrats didn \u2019 t show divisions or expose fault lines . They did . Political parties are chaotic things . The Democratic Party \u2019 s primary was unusually bitter , and listening to the loud `` boos '' of Sanders \u2019 s most committed supporters , there \u2019 s real reason to wonder whether Democrats will fracture in coming years . But for now , the Democrats nominated a normal candidate , held a normal convention , and remain a normal political party .\nRepublicans held an abnormal convention and nominated an abnormal candidate\nThe Republican Party \u2019 s convention was not a normal political party \u2019 s convention . The party nominated Donald Trump , a new member with literally no experience in government . Ted Cruz , the runner-up in the primary , gave a primetime speech in which he refused to endorse Trump , and instead told Americans to `` vote your conscience . ''\nThe Republican Party \u2019 s two living presidents , George W. Bush and George H.W . Bush , declined to endorse Trump or attend the convention . The party \u2019 s previous two presidential nominees , Mitt Romney and John McCain , declined to endorse Trump or attend the convention . The assembled speakers \u2014 including Chris Christie , a prospective attorney general \u2014 argued that the other party \u2019 s nominee was a criminal who should be thrown in jail .\nEven the normal parts of the convention felt abnormal . The prospective first lady \u2019 s speech included a passage plagiarized from the Democratic Party \u2019 s first lady . Trump counterprogrammed the first night of his own convention by doing a phone interview with Fox News and an hour-long discussion with the Golf Channel . He distracted from his running mate \u2019 s acceptance speech by telling the New York Times he would not automatically honor America \u2019 s commitments under the NATO treaty . Trump \u2019 s speech was enthusiastically endorsed by David Duke , the former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan . `` Couldn \u2019 t have said it better , '' he tweeted .\nThe strangeness didn \u2019 t end with the convention . The next day \u2014 the very next day ! \u2014 Trump gave a press conference in which he said Ted Cruz \u2019 s father was likely involved in the assassination of JFK , swore he wouldn \u2019 t accept Cruz \u2019 s endorsement even if it were offered , and argued that the National Enquirer deserved a Pulitzer Prize . It was one of the strangest and most self-destructive political performances in recent memory . The conservative Weekly Standard was left agog . The Republican Party \u2019 s nominee , Stephen Hayes wrote , `` is not of sound mind . ''\nThen , befitting the dignity we expect in our presidential aspirants , the Republican Party \u2019 s nominee spent his week live-tweeting the Democratic Party \u2019 s convention , with deep , thoughtful commentary like :\nThe invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) July 26 , 2016\nElizabeth Warren , often referred to as Pocahontas , just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary , who she always hated ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) July 26 , 2016\nHe followed that up with a press conference at which he blasted the job Tim Kaine had done in \u2026 New Jersey ? Of course , Kaine was the governor of Virginia . Trump seems to have literally confused the Democrats \u2019 vice presidential nominee with Tom Kean , the former Republican governor of New Jersey .\nUnwilling to stop there , Trump went on to comment on the hack of the Democratic National Committee \u2019 s emails , which most experts think was conducted by Russia . `` Russia , if you are listening , I hope you are able to find the 33,000 emails that are missing \u2014 I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press , '' he said .\nLet \u2019 s stop there for a second : Donald Trump went out and asked a foreign government to conduct cyber espionage in order to help his campaign . His supporters initially tried to laugh it off as an ad-libbed joke , but then Trump tweeted the same thing . This came only hours after his running mate , Mike Pence , had warned of `` serious consequences '' if Russia truly was behind the DNC hack .\nAmerica \u2019 s main political cleavage is between the Democratic and Republican parties . That split has meant different things at different times , but in recent decades it primarily tracks an ideological disagreement : Democrats are the party of liberal policies ; Republicans are the party of conservative policies .\nBut in this year \u2019 s presidential election , the difference is more fundamental than that : The Democratic Party is a normal political party that has nominated a normal presidential candidate , and the Republican Party has become an abnormal political party that has nominated an abnormal presidential candidate .\nSimply saying that will raise people \u2019 s partisan hackles , but it \u2019 s not a partisan comment . Republicans know that Donald Trump is not a normal nominee . They know this isn \u2019 t what their 2012 convention looked like or how their 2008 convention felt . And while most Republicans fear Democrats keeping the White House enough to unhappily support Trump , it \u2019 s worth listening to what they \u2019 ve said about him .\nTed Cruz called Trump a `` pathological liar , '' `` utterly amoral , '' and `` a narcissist at a level I do n't think this country 's ever seen . ''\nRick Perry said Trump \u2019 s candidacy was `` a cancer on conservatism , and it must be clearly diagnosed , excised , and discarded . ''\nNational Review , the flagship journal of American conservatism , said Trump `` is a menace to American conservatism . ''\nRand Paul said Trump is `` a delusional narcissist and an orange-faced windbag . A speck of dirt is way more qualified to be president . ''\nA list like this could go on , and on , and on . But here \u2019 s the point : These aren \u2019 t normal political condemnations . This isn \u2019 t normal political language . Republicans know they \u2019 ve nominated a dangerous man . They tried to warn their voters in the strongest terms possible that Trump is unqualified , untrustworthy , and amoral .\nMichael Bloomberg , the former Republican mayor of New York City , put it simply in a speech endorsing Clinton . `` Together , let 's elect a sane , competent person , '' he said . That is what an endorsement sounds like when the choice shifts from left versus right to normal versus abnormal .\nThere are some differences in politics that transcend ideology . This is one of them . Clinton , say what you will about her , is a normal political candidate who will operate within the normal boundaries of American democracy . Donald Trump is an abnormal political candidate ; we have no idea which democratic boundaries he would respect , which conspiracy theories he would believe , which political enemies he would punish , which treaties he would honor .\nTrump has already been scolded by his own party for racist comments , for attacks on the judiciary , for undermining the NATO alliance , for inviting foreign governments to meddle in American elections . None of this is okay . None of it is normal . This is not a man with the temperament , the steadiness , or the discipline to be president .\nThis election puts Republicans in a hard position . Even as the choice in this election is between a normal candidate and an abnormal one , it \u2019 s also between a liberal candidate and a , well , conservative-ish one . I don \u2019 t doubt Trump would nominate pro-life judges , or that he would resist raising taxes . I understand why so many Republicans have decided to suppress their doubts and support him .\nBut this is a dangerous game . We are a nation protected by norms , not just by laws . Our political parties should be held to certain standards in terms of the candidates they nominate , the behaviors they accept , the ideas they mainstream . Trump violates those standards . By indulging him , the Republican Party is normalizing him and his behavior , and making itself abnormal .",
