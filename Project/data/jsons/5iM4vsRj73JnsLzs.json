    "content": "In his victory speech last night , Donald J. Trump paid homage to \u201c the forgotten men and women of our country , \u201d vowing that they \u201c will be forgotten no longer. \u201d This essential political idea \u2014 that a vast segment of the nation \u2019 s white citizens have been overlooked , or looked down upon \u2014 has driven every major realignment in American politics since the New Deal .\nIn 1932 , at the darkest moment of the Great Depression , Franklin Roosevelt evoked the \u201c forgotten man \u201d as a reason to rebuild the economy from the \u201c bottom up. \u201d More than three decades later , after Richard Nixon \u2019 s 1968 victory , the journalist Peter Schrag identified the \u201c Forgotten American \u201d \u2014 the white \u201c lower middle class \u201d voter \u2014 as the key to the nation \u2019 s apparent rejection of the Great Society and the New Deal order . \u201c In the guise of the working class \u2014 or the American yeoman or John Smith \u2014 he was once the hero of the civic books , the man that Andrew Jackson called \u2018 the bone and sinew of the country , \u2019 \u201d Mr. Schrag wrote . \u201c Now he is \u2018 the forgotten man , \u2019 perhaps the most alienated person in America . \u201d\nThat this \u201c forgotten \u201d American could be used both to uphold and to dismantle liberalism suggests that this American political identity has never been especially fixed : Democrat or Republican , liberal or conservative , but populist above all . Since the 1960s , the phrase has also implied that the country was paying too much attention to the wrong sorts of people \u2014 most notably , to African-Americans \u2014 at the expense of the white working class . It is no coincidence that the \u201c forgotten men and women of our country \u201d began their migration into the Republican Party at the very moment that African-Americans were asserting their right to vote , and voting Democratic , in large numbers for the first time . Mr. Trump \u2019 s victory will go down as one of the great upsets in United States history , but it is also the product of a long and bitter struggle over race and class in this country .\nThe Yale sociologist William Graham Sumner is often credited with coining the term \u201c forgotten man. \u201d Writing near the dawn of the Progressive Era , he lamented the lost autonomy of hard-working citizens suddenly forced to pay for high-flown programs of social reform . Sumner \u2019 s most famous political essay , \u201c What the Social Classes Owe to Each Other , \u201d rejected the very idea that government might mitigate class antagonisms by sharing the social wealth . What did social classes owe to each other ? Not much , in Sumner \u2019 s view . And his \u201c forgotten man \u201d owed the least of all .\nIn his 1932 campaign for the presidency , Roosevelt sought to claim the term for a different and more expansive purpose . \u201c These unhappy times call for the building of plans that rest upon the forgotten , \u201d he said in a radio address from Albany in April 1932 , for plans \u201c that build from the bottom up and not from the top down , that put their faith once more in the forgotten man at the bottom of the economic pyramid . \u201d\nTo Roosevelt , the \u201c forgotten man \u201d encompassed the industrial worker and struggling farmer and Keynesian consumer \u2014 ordinary citizens without whom a modern economy would falter . He built the New Deal around this image , establishing the minimum wage , Social Security and the federal right to organize unions . Those reforms cemented the loyalty of the white working class to the Democratic Party for a generation .\nBut the New Deal also \u201c forgot \u201d \u2014 or excluded \u2014 many people , including African-Americans . When the Great Society came along , Lyndon Johnson tried to make up for that by expanding federal programs serving the poor and by championing the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts . As the country started to \u201c remember \u201d its long-delayed promises of equality , however , the \u201c forgotten American \u201d began to emerge as term of exclusion and resistance to change . \u201c There is hardly a language to describe him , or even a set of social statistics , \u201d Mr. Schrag wrote in his August 1969 essay , \u201c The Forgotten American. \u201d \u201c Just names : racist-bigot-redneck-ethnic-Irish-Italian-Pole-Hunkie-Yahoo . The lower middle class . A blank . \u201d\nAs Mr. Schrag noted , all of that name-calling was part of the problem , a refusal on the part of liberal elites to recognize the real grievances and desires of what had once been a bedrock Democratic constituency . In the 1968 campaign , Nixon capitalized on this resentment with calls for \u201c law and order , \u201d a phrase that evoked not only fears of crime , but also anger at protesters and rioters and the college-campus liberals who tolerated them . Mr. Trump put that phrase back into political circulation in 2016 , a gesture of solidarity with the old ways of thinking about the \u201c silent majority \u201d \u2014 and the \u201c forgotten American. \u201d And though he included \u201c men and women \u201d in his victory speech , Mr. Trump \u2019 s campaign mobilized around the same image that once animated the Roosevelt coalition : the \u201c forgotten \u201d white working-class man .\nRace , too , remains an indelible part of today \u2019 s conversation about who has been \u201c forgotten \u201d and who deserves to be seen . To dismiss this language as simple racism , however , is to miss at least some of its political significance . What happened in the late 1960s and 1970s was not only that the Republican Party reclaimed and redefined Roosevelt \u2019 s \u201c forgotten man \u201d for a more conservative age . During those years , the Democratic Party itself began to turn away from the New Deal and its working-class politics , especially from its commitment to organized labor .\nWith Mr. Trump \u2019 s election , we may be witnessing the rise of a new party system , with the Democrats now the standard-bearers of racial tolerance and free-market globalization , and the Republicans the party of nationalist populist revolt . But as Roosevelt showed , this need not be a fixed political equation . If the 2016 election marks the final , gasping end of the New Deal coalition , it should also mark the start of a new reckoning within the Democratic Party .",
