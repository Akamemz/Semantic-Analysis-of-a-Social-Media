''\nMost cyberattacks must be authorized by the president , but because attacks happen in milliseconds , the document authorizes the military and other agencies to respond to the threat of an imminent attack or an emergency situation .\nProtecting critical infrastructure in the US also is outlined in the document .\nDespite years of wrangling , Congress has still not approved legislation addressing cybersecurity for the nation \u2019 s infrastructure , and the document does not permit the Pentagon to intrude into networks of domestic companies , such as utilities , and install defenses within computer networks that control the power grid .\nBut it does allow the military to defend the infrastructure from outside those networks \u2013 by identifying and undermining or destroying the attacking system and its key infrastructure .
