    "content": "It was , finally , the moment Democrats have been waiting for : Former Secretary Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders facing off one-on-one , unencumbered by extraneous candidates and audience questions . Last night \u2019 s MSNBC debate crackled with heat , as the two candidates stood very close to each other on stage and made their case to the watching public , answering questions from moderators Rachel Maddow and Chuck Todd . It led to both candidates becoming their most provocative\u2014Clinton was forceful and dismissive , while Sanders was stern and evasive . The first hour exacerbated the tension between them , as both candidates seemed to entrench in their worldviews , no matter how unpopular . The two bickered over the definition of the word \u201c progressive \u201d \u2014it comes from the word \u201c progress , \u201d did you know ? \u2014and of who , exactly , is part of the \u201c establishment. \u201d As I observed yesterday , during the CNN Democratic Town Hall , both Sanders and Clinton were attempting to finesse compromises ( or the semblance thereof ) between polar opposites , the rhetorical equivalent of walking the plank . But debates are about differentiation , and primaries are about being choosy , so here we stood , watching mom and dad argue after dinner as if the whole state of the free world depended on it .\nThings got kind of intense . They dug into each other \u2019 s differences , trying to make sound untrue what is patently obvious to the outside observer : Sanders is a stubborn college professor , obsessively dedicated to principle ; Clinton is a bureaucrat \u2019 s bureaucrat , doggedly focused on process . And frankly , neither candidate is served by a debate . This isn \u2019 t an election where adulation for a candidate \u2019 s ideology swept the other nominees , \u00e0 la then-Senator Barack Obama in 2008 . This is an election between two pragmatic , prickly politicians , two grandparents who have been in public service for decades . Debates make them fighters . And while this head-to-head match-up was long overdue , the first segment of the debate was honestly exhausting to watch , especially after the introspection of the informal town hall . Perhaps the Democratic party is just a little too bleeding-heart to revel in the bloodsport of two strong liberal politicians trying to take each other down , but it certainly seemed that every attack made from one candidate to the other looked mostly bad for that candidate ; when Clinton railed against Sanders for his \u201c artful smear \u201d of her politics , she was booed , and when Sanders dismissed Clinton as a shill of the establishment , he dismissed for the obvious fact that a woman candidate for president is a revolution in and of itself .\nProcess and principle sparred again and again , and moderators Maddow and Todd did well to let the two speak while also finding incisive , specific questions to address to each . It \u2019 s difficult for any moderator to hold a candle to Rachel Maddow , but especially when grilling both liberal candidates , she dazzled . She directed a question to Sanders that struck to the heart of the practical difficulties of his platform\u2014asking him how he planned to work with the corporations that advanced progressive agendas , those corporations that had to be dealt with to pass the Affordable Healthcare Act , for example . She asked Clinton for the chance to see the transcripts of those Goldman Sachs speeches . Maddow asked Sanders how he really intended to win the presidency as , essentially , a third-party candidate . And she asked Clinton to justify how she still considered herself a viable candidate , multiple scandals into her career . If Sanders and Clinton were bickering , last night , over the custody of the American people , Maddow was the impish child playing them against each other ; indeed , the night \u2019 s most heated exchanges came as a result of her pointed questioning .\nWhich might be why about halfway through the debate , the tension of night noticeably defused . Maybe Sanders and Clinton wised up to Maddow \u2019 s game ; maybe it was too late in the day , and too late in the campaign trail , to waste so much energy on being angry on television . Of course Clinton \u2019 s farther right than Sanders ; come the general election , she \u2019 s going to be trying to appear moderate . Of course Sanders \u2019 policies will be a bit harder to enact than Clinton \u2019 s ; he is , in his own words , literally instigating a revolution .\nThe segment on foreign policy allowed the candidates to take a breather ; Clinton immediately was more confident , going over her area of expertise , and diverted from his primary issue of capitalism , Sanders was a bit of a wallflower , allowing for some breathing room in the discussion . By the time Todd and Maddow returned to discussing the scandals of the campaign , both candidates seemed like they \u2019 d gotten the sparring out of their system . A question about Clinton \u2019 s emails elicited a steadfastly neutral response from Sanders : \u201c There 's not a day that goes by when I am not asked to attack her on that issue , and I have refrained from doing that and I will continue to refrain from doing that. \u201d And when Maddow asked Clinton if she wanted 30 seconds to discuss an allegedly misleading advertisement from the Sanders campaign , Clinton just stared a bit , with an exasperation she deployed well at the Benghazi hearings , and then simply responded , \u201c No . \u201d\nIt was a very parental \u201c no. \u201d Final , but with some warmth attached . And it indicated a deep respect for either the other candidate or for the optics of cooperation , which often are exactly the same . I think that Sanders and Clinton have real issues with each other , but I also think that neither Sanders nor Clinton really want to fight with each other , and at the end of the day , despite the whiz-bang of the zingers , neither do we . Beyond the artificial dichotomy of the debate , Sanders and Clinton are all we 've got\u2014two viable candidates against a stack of wildcards that are still funded and still in the race over on the other team . Of course , calling them Mom and Dad is reductive and gender-essentialist ; I am being a little facetious . But there 's a certain degree of unearned faith I 'm pinning on both that is the same desperate confidence we all invest in our parents , when we need to believe them when they say that they will keep us safe from danger . And it 's not just me that feels it . As is the habit of kids everywhere , Todd rushed into the awkward camaraderie between the candidates with a too-soon , too-intimate question .\nSecretary Clinton , you 've made it clear when you look at Senator Sanders , you do not see a president , but do you see \u2026 do you see a vice president ? [ Clinton laughs . ] Would you unite the party by trying to pick Senator Sanders as your running mate ?\nThere \u2019 s no better evidence of the Democratic Party \u2019 s desperate desire for a united front against the looming specter of loony Republicans than this question , the political equivalent of politely asking mom and dad if they will get back together . The debate was revealing , but the questions were even more so ; arguments about how to arrange the deck chairs gave way to the realization that the Titanic is sinking . Sanders quipped , \u201c On our worst days , I think it is fair to say we are 100 times better than any Republican candidate. \u201d The crowd cheered . And after closing statements , when Maddow and Todd said goodbye to the candidates , Maddow made sure to hug each .",
