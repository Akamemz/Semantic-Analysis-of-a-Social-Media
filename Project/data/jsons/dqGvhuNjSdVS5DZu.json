Another 14 officials were forwarded for possible disciplinary action .\nRep. Darrell Issa , R-Calif. , chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , said at a hearing Thursday where Inspector General Michael Horowitz testified that `` all 14 '' should leave the department .\nOther lawmakers suggested senior officials -- particularly criminal division chief Lanny Breuer -- should at least face discipline . Further , they hammered the point that the IG report appeared to contradict Holder 's testimony earlier this year in which he said wiretap applications did not reveal that gunwalking tactics were being used .\nThe complaints signaled that , while lawmakers on both sides of the aisle claim to be pleased with the extensiveness of the IG report , Republican critics will continue to push for more documents and more discipline in the wake of the Fast and Furious scandal .\n`` Sadly , the Department of Justice was not vindicated , '' said Rep. Trey Gowdy , R-S.C. `` I just ... ca n't imagine a headline that reads ... 'passengers charged with speeding , driver exonerated ' . ''\nThe report faulted a range of agencies and accused officials of a `` disregard '' for public safety .
