This is just politics as usual , via the WSJ :\nHouse Education Chairman John Kline \u2019 s bill sets floating rates on new Stafford loans at the 10-year Treasury rate plus 2.5 % , while also protecting borrowers by capping the rates at 8.5 % . Under this plan , a borrower can consolidate his loans after graduation to achieve a fixed rate . Mr. Obama \u2019 s plan is purely for fixed , not floating , rates at the 10-year Treasury rate plus 0.93 % or 2.93 % depending on the type of Stafford loan , and it has no rate cap . We wish both the House and Mr. Obama would drive a harder bargain on behalf of the taxpayer , but they aren \u2019 t separated by a difference of philosophy . A spread of 93 or 293 basis points means the President cares about young people , but 250 basis points signifies unspeakable cruelty ? \u2026 Under either plan , rates for new Stafford loans for undergraduates will not nearly rise all the way to 6.8 % from 3.4 % , as they are scheduled to do on July 1 . But the White House likes to run against a doubling of rates even when , as in this case , they are running unopposed . It has been a good political issue for Team Obama in the past , and there \u2019 s another reason they may regard it as favorable ground to attack imaginary adversaries .\nHey , if President Obama really wants to focus in on helping young people with life after college , maybe we could worry a little less about piddling , stimulus-esque , big-government market interferences and a little more on our sluggish economy and 16 percent youth unemployment rate ?
