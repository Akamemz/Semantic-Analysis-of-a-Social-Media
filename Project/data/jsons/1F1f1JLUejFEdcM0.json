The Islamic State has billions of dollars in the bank , so they call on their wilayah ( Province ) in Pakistan to purchase a nuclear device through weapons dealers with links to corrupt officials in the region .

''\nThe Islamic State is using the latest issue of its propaganda magazine Dabiq to pose the `` far-fetched '' hypothetical of purchasing its first nuclear weapon from Pakistan within a year and getting it into the United States through the porous Southern border.The terrorists raise the issue in an op-ed piece entitled `` The Perfect Storm '' that it attributes to John Cantlie , the British photojournalist whom ISIS took hostage in November 2012 , The Independent reports . Cantlie has since appeared in many of the group 's propaganda videos.Here are the key sections of the piece , according to the Independent Journal Review : The article readily admits , however , that the scenario is `` far-fetched , '' though warning : `` It \u2019 s the sum of all fears for Western intelligence agencies and it \u2019 s infinitely more possible today than it was just one year ago . `` And if not a nuke , what about a few thousand tons of ammonium nitrate explosive ? That \u2019 s easy enough to make . `` The piece , according to the Independent , also discussed how the militant Islamic group Boko Haram and others are uniting to create a global movement.Two months ago , Boko Haram pledged its support to ISIS . The alignment , according to Cantlie 's piece , comes as the Islamic State has seized `` tanks , rocket launchers , missile systems , anti-aircraft systems '' from the United States and Iran . The op-ed then raises the nuclear scenario , the Independent reports.The op-ed follows disclosures by the Obama administration that U.S. Delta Forces killed ISIS finance chief Fathi ben Awn ben Jildi Murad , known as Abu Sayyaf , on April 15 in a rare ground operation in Syria.Murad 's wife , known as Umm Sayyaf , was taken into custody for interrogation , U.S. officials said.The piece also comes as U.S. Border Patrol officials report a surge in illegal immigrants from Central America being apprehended while crossing into the U.S. at the border . In addition , Judicial Watch reported last month that ISIS has set up a training camp in northern Mexico just eight miles from El Paso , Texas.Further , an ISIS attack in the U.S. would pale compared to `` the attacks of the past , '' the op-ed piece states . `` They \u2019 ll [ ISIS ] be looking to do something big , something that would make any past operation look like a squirrel shoot , and the more groups that pledge allegiance the more possible it becomes to pull off something truly epic . `` Remember , all of this has happened in less than a year , '' the piece continued . `` How more dangerous will be the lines of communication and supply a year on from today ? `` This is n't the first time the terrorist group has made such a threat . In 2014 , a British member of the extremist group with the nom de guerre Muslim al-Britani claimed it had obtained uranium during its seizure of an Iraqi university in Mosul and was in possession of a \u201c dirty bomb. \u201d Others have claimed they could cause major damage in Western capitals such as London , according to the British Mirror newspaper.But many experts reject the idea that the major weapons possessed by ISIS could be easily transported outside Iraq or Syria .
