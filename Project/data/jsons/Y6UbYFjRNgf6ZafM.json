One student was recorded as saying , \u201c The rockets are hitting Israel every day , really ? Good for them , let \u2019 s keep hitting Israel until they give their [ the Palestinians ] land back. \u201d In the letter , New York State assemblyman Douglas Smith , a Republican , wrote that \u201c this video shows nearly 200 students harassing , cursing , yelling , and physically destroying tables and displays put together by the College Republicans to promote this prestigious speaker and the event. \u201d \u201c During the video , students are threatened and physically intimidated for expressing their political views , including their support for the nation of Israel , \u201d he wrote.Mentioned in the letter was also the way in which students reacted \u201c when State University Police arrived to intervene. \u201c [ The ] angry mob of students begin chanting , \u2018 No justice . No peace . No racist police. \u2019 They then proceed to get into the police officer \u2019 s face while screaming about how they believe it is within their first amendment rights to be violent , disruptive , and destructive of the property of others , \u201d he recalled.Smith , who is the Ranking Minority Member of the Assembly \u2019 s Committee on Higher Education , stressed that he would like to know \u201c what steps the college will be taking to promote inclusion and diversity on campus ; this includes diversity of political opinion. \u201d He added that \u201c the halls of academia should be a place for the free exchange of ideas. \u201d \u201c I am hopeful that you will actively work to ensure that State University of New York at Binghamton students are able to peacefully exercise their first amendment rights on campus without fear of physical violence in the future , \u201d he concluded.Following a response from the university to the letter , Smith said that he was \u201c very disappointed \u201d that the university seemed \u201c to excuse their students \u2019 bad behavior and blame the Binghamton College Republicans for \u2018 triggering \u2019 their students with a Second Amendment poster. \u201d He warned that \u201c if the university fails to identify and take proper disciplinary action against these students , who had a temper tantrum and physically shut down their peers \u2019 ability to peacefully exercise their First Amendment Rights , they will be condoning violence against their own students. \u201d Smith stressed that there was no excuse for this behavior.Tommy Gagliano , a Binghamton student and editor-in-chief of The Binghamton Review , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that he was in class when it happened , \u201c but saw it all over social media. \u201d \u201c It was a ridiculous overreaction to an innocent event , \u201d he said . \u201c Far-leftists saw \u2018 Make America Great Again \u2019 hats and flipped. \u201c Pipe Dream , the school \u2019 s mainstream newspaper , then wrote an extremely dishonest story in which they spread a false narrative that the members of the College Republicans and Turning Point USA were promoting gun rights in response to a school shooting , \u201d he claimed.He said that in his opinion , people trying to frame the conservative students was beyond ridiculous.He said that The Binghamton Review , which promotes free speech and has typically attracted conservative and libertarian writers , made a point of speaking to people and gathering information that was not previously reported.Binghamton University College Republicans president John Restuccia recalled the incident , citing that the almost 200 students \u201c mobbed our tables , verbally harassed us , knocked over our tables , threw our materials and generally threatened and intimidated us. \u201c There is plenty of video evidence of these dangerous and potentially criminal actions by those who mobbed the area , \u201d he said in a statement released on Sunday night. \u201c It has been suggested that the incident in question occurred because we didn \u2019 t have proper permitting , \u201d he said . \u201c In the past , Turning Point USA and our organization have \u2018 tabled \u2019 without any problems and weren \u2019 t required to secure any sort of permits.He emphasized that \u201c countless other organizations have similarly \u2018 tabled \u2019 without a permit requirement. \u201d Restuccia called on the university \u201c to protect the First Amendment \u201d and demanded that the University \u201c take action against those who committed criminal behavior clearly evidenced in the video. \u201d In a statement , Binghamton University president Harvey G. Stenger noted the incident and the need for university police to get involved. \u201c Police response was appropriate and important to make sure that every student involved in this matter was safe and remained safe , \u201d he said . \u201c The incident ended and the crowd was able to be dispersed without anyone getting injured. \u201d Stenger called the incident unfortunate \u201c from all perspectives. \u201c As a University , we encourage everyone to consider the perspectives of others \u2014 and the damaging impact words and images can have \u2014 even if they are protected as free speech under the First Amendment , \u201d Stenger continued . \u201c We strongly condemn any acts that impede the expression of one \u2019 s beliefs but also encourage everyone on this campus to enter into meaningful interactions with respectful dialogue and actions . \u201d",
