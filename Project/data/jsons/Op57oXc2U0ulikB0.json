President Obama has been asked what his biggest failure or disappointment has been during his first term three times this year and he's given three different answers.\n\nFrom 60 Minutes Sunday:\n\nI'm the first one to confess that-- the spirit that I brought to Washington, that I wanted to see instituted, where we weren't constantly-- in-- in a political slugfest but were focused more on problem solving that, you know, I haven't fully accomplished that. Haven't even come close in some cases. And-- you know, if you ask me\u2014what\u2019s my biggest disappointment is that we haven't changed the tone in Washington as much as I would have liked.\n\nFrom Univision last week:\n\nJORGE RAMOS: What is your biggest failure? OBAMA: Well, Jorge as you remind me, my biggest failure so far is we haven\u2019t gotten comprehensive immigration reform done, so we\u2019re going to be continuing to work on that. But it\u2019s not for lack of trying or desire.\n\nFrom ABC News in July:\n\n\u201cThe mistake of my first term \u2013 couple of years \u2013 was thinking that this job was just about getting the policy right,\u201d Obama told CBS News\u2019 Charlie Rose. \u201cAnd that\u2019s important, but, you know, the nature of this office is also to tell a story to the American people that gives them a sense of unity and purpose and optimism, especially during tough times.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs a recap, President Obama's \"biggest\" failure(s) are not telling enough stories, not changing the tone in Washington and not getting immigration reform through (despite having a super majority of Democrats his first two years in office.) Obama didn't say his biggest failure is not getting people back to work or not turning the economy around as he promised to do.\n\nObama has a habit of being inconsistent, whether it's giving different answers about his biggest failure, saying he hasn't raised taxes or making nearly everything a \"top priority.\"",
