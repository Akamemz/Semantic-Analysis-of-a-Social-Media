And some economists are also calling for a return-to-work timetable to protect the economy from long-term damage .\nIt \u2019 s a sign of how the stay-at-home orders that 21 states will have in place by the end of this week represent a blunt instrument , which may help keep the coronavirus from spreading but is also pounding the economy in unprecedented ways .\nOn Thursday , the U.S. Labor Department reported that 3.3 million Americans filed initial jobless claims , a record in more than 50 years of data and more than four times the previous record .\nSome Americans are beginning to chafe under the coronavirus restrictions that authorities have put into place \u2013 not least of them President Donald Trump , who this week suggested lifting restrictions at least partially by Easter on April 12 to start revving up the economy .\nIt \u2019 s an ambitious timetable and , to many , a callous one . How dare a president , or anyone , put the health of the economy ahead of the safety of citizens ? But the president \u2019 s statement highlights another reality that conservatives especially have been grumbling about : The extraordinary stay-at-home orders that 21 states will have in place by the end of this week represent a blunt instrument , which may keep the virus from spreading but is also pounding the economy in unprecedented ways .\nThe latest evidence came Thursday , when the U.S. Labor Department reported that 3.3 million Americans filed initial jobless claims last week , a record in more than 50 years of data and more than four times the previous record .\nA recession is likely , if not already underway . The restrictions on the economy are so far-reaching that businesses have been forced to close , throwing millions out of work , and keeping consumers , a mainstay of the economy , from shopping .\nSome analysts are predicting that economic activity could shrink by up to a quarter this spring , a terrifying drop that , were there no recovery the rest of the year , would mean economic dislocation on a scale that would outstrip any single year of the Great Depression .\nTo many experts , the question is not really if authorities will ease the restrictions , but when . In theory , the sooner that happens , the less damage the economy will sustain . But there \u2019 s a big caveat . The recent focus on containing the spread of the COVID-19 disease could be key to both limiting the ultimate costs both to the economy and to human lives \u2013 including the risk of hospital systems becoming overwhelmed with patients . For now , that focus on containment remains paramount , many say .\n\u201c We will get to a moment where there will be [ only ] so much risk we have to be willing to take , but right now we \u2019 re not in that world , \u201d says Sherry Glied , a health economist and dean of New York University \u2019 s Wagner Graduate School of Public Service . \u201c We have to stop the threat of this epidemic , \u201d she adds . \u201c There \u2019 s no point rebuilding while the bombs are still dropping . \u201d\nIn her view , it makes sense to wait for progress on the scientific front , and for the government to be planning now for how it will reopen the economy in the future , while also making sure basic needs like food and housing are met .\nAlready , nations including Denmark and Britain are trying to cap economic damage by covering a large chunk of worker salaries for businesses that have seen revenues plunge . A $ 2 trillion relief package moving through Congress Thursday , similarly , throws a lifeline to businesses ( loans ) and workers ( cash payments and stepped-up jobless benefits ) .\nSOURCE : Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis ( with data from U.S. Department of Labor ) | Jacob Turcotte/Staff\nIn weighing how and when to reopen the economy , part of the conundrum is that no one has fully quantified the risks posed by the virus .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t have that data , \u201d says Howard Markel , a medical doctor and professor of the history of medicine at the University of Michigan \u2019 s School of Public Health . The number of reported deaths has triggered alarm in the medical community and suggests that this virus is several times more deadly than a more typical seasonal flu . But public health officials have not been able to establish a concrete fatality rate because testing limitations have made it difficult to get a handle on the number of individuals who have become infected and recovered . When will health authorities have a handle on those numbers ? \u201c My hope is two to four weeks , \u201d Dr. Markel says .\nIt \u2019 s such timetables that make Mr. Trump \u2019 s Easter deadline , just over two weeks away , look unrealistic .\nEven with the data in hand , health authorities would have to determine the best ways to ease restrictions . Should they target only hard-hit regions ? Or is it better to focus on sheltering the elderly and those diagnosed with other diseases ?\nAccording to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center , the U.S. has become the global epicenter of the pandemic with nearly 86,000 confirmed cases , more than any other nation .\nWith the House of Representatives taking up the $ 2 trillion Senate-passed rescue bill , health authorities have some breathing room to determine the best ways to keep the population safe .\nThe economy can accept a certain amount of risk , and cost-benefit analyses are made routinely , points out Vivian Ho , an economics professor at Rice University and a professor at Baylor College of Medicine , both in Houston . \u201c It \u2019 s a tough exercise in this particular situation , but someone needs to put those numbers down . We need to start thinking of maybe we should not shut everything down . \u201d\n\u201c You \u2019 re talking about real damage to people \u2019 s lives , to the 30 million small businesses in America , \u201d says Chris Edwards , director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute , a libertarian think tank in Washington . \u201c People \u2019 s lives and dreams are in these small businesses and in their careers . And some of them could be ruined permanently . \u201d\nAlready , some Americans are beginning to push back on the restrictions , such as by holding social gatherings . A Louisiana pastor continues to defy Louisiana \u2019 s ban on gatherings of more than 50 by busing in attendees from five different parishes ( counties ) for Sunday services with what he claims are up to 1,000 people .\nIn Texas , public officials have begun to complain openly about the restrictions .\n\u201c My message is : Let \u2019 s get back to work . Let \u2019 s get back to living , \u201d Lt. Gov . Dan Patrick told Fox News in an interview Monday . \u201c Let \u2019 s be smart about it \u2026 but don \u2019 t sacrifice the country . Don \u2019 t do that . Don \u2019 t sacrifice the American dream . \u201d\nIn Harris County , home to Houston , Republican state Sen. Paul Bettencourt warned that a stay-at-home order restricting business would be \u201c economically calamitous . \u201d\nThere \u2019 s no real precedent for the economic threat now facing the U.S . The Spanish flu of 1918 occurred in a far different context . The country was coming off a war footing . Restrictions were limited to certain cities .\nEven comparisons to sudden recent economic disasters like 9/11 and the 2008 financial crisis are off base , says Jonathan Bydlak , director of the Fiscal and Budget Policy Project at the R Street Institute , a free-market think tank in Washington . \u201c We \u2019 re dealing with a very unique situation , and there \u2019 s not a whole lot in economics books that teach you how to deal with these situations . \u201d\nNevertheless , many economists continue to stress the importance of taming the virus first before tackling the economy .\n\u201c I think the first order of business will be to get the spread of the virus under control , and then resume economic activity , \u201d Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told NBC \u2019 s \u201c Today \u201d show Thursday .\nWhile not opposing that sequence , two high-profile economists called on Monday for a timetable to avoid letting the economy die of neglect .\nA quarter of all workers should be back on their jobs within two months , and 75 % of workers within four months , wrote Nobel Prize winner Paul Romer and Alan Garber , a physician and economist at Harvard University , in a New York Times opinion column .
