''\nWhile the administration has said the task force will look at a range of issues to address gun violence in the wake of the Connecticut school shooting -- from mental health to the entertainment industry -- the NRA said Thursday 's discussion focused `` on proposed restrictions on lawful firearms owners -- honest , taxpaying , hardworking Americans .
