    "content": "Happy tax day , America . Uncle Sam is processing more than $ 2.4 trillion in 2012 tax receipts -- which , all told , would less than 70 percent of the federal government 's expenditures during fiscal year '12 , resulting in a deficit of approximately $ 1.1 trillion .

As Philip Klein explained in February , we do n't have a `` revenue problem : ''\nBetween 2014 and 2023 , according to CBO estimates , annual tax receipts will soar by 65 percent . During that time period , revenue collected by the federal government will average 18.9 percent of the economy . That 's 1 point higher than the 17.9 percent average from the end of World War II to the year 2000 ( just before George W. Bush 's first round of tax cuts was passed . ) At the same time , due to negotiated budget caps and automatic cuts known as the sequester , defense spending is projected to grow relatively modestly -- by about 20 percent over the next decade . By 2023 , defense spending will account for only 12 percent of the overall federal budget . Not only is this well below the historical average , it 's the lowest level since at least 1940 , when the White House Office of Management and Budget data begin .
