Secretary Clinton , can you tell us why you appointed the Accountability Review Board , chaired by Ambassador Thomas Pickering and Adm. Michael Mullen , to investigate the Benghazi tragedy and what was the result of their work ?\nOf course , if they ask Clinton this question , they will learn that she gave the board , led by a former U.S . Ambassador to the United Nations under Republican President George H.W . Bush and a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs , complete independence and access . She committed ahead of time , unlike any prior secretaries before her , to full transparency . And when she published the full report ( except for some classified material ) , she immediately accepted all the board \u2019 s recommendations to correct \u201c systemic failures \u201d of the department prior to and during the tragedy , and took responsibility .\n2 . Secretary Clinton , as you know , seven other congressional committees have investigated the Benghazi attack . Is there anything they missed that we should be looking into ?\nOf course , if Gowdy and the Republican members ask this question , they will have to try to explain why their committee exists at all ( other than the anti-Clinton reason that everyone knows ) unless they are willing to criticize other Republican Benghazi committees for not doing an adequate job , such as the Republican-controlled House Armed Services and Intelligence committees , which published extensive reports and findings about Benghazi .\n3 . Secretary Clinton , did your choice to use a single BlackBerry to send out emails during your tenure as secretary of State rather than two , or your decision to store emails on a private server at your home , have any impact whatsoever on the tragic events of what happened at Benghazi and its aftermath ?\nOf course , the truthful \u2014 and indisputable \u2014 answer to this question is : No . Gowdy and his fellow Republicans know this .\nEvery single member who asks any question about emails \u2014 Gowdy , Brooks , Jordan , Pompeo , Roby , Roskham and Westmoreland \u2014 should be asked by the media and all constituents back home who care about wasteful government spending : How can you justify spending almost $ 5 million of taxpayer money when you have uncovered nothing new , duplicated spending by fellow Republicans , and have spent so much time on a subject having nothing to do with the tragedy at Benghazi ?\nLet \u2019 s see if any of these Republicans ask any of the above three questions or acknowledge that they have wasted taxpayer dollars in trying to hurt Hillary Clinton politically rather than trying to save American lives who serve at dangerous embassy locations in the future .\nDavis served as special counsel to former President Clinton and is principal in the Washington , D.C. , law firm of Lanny J.
