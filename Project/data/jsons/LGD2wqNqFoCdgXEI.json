    "content": "The Supreme Court on Thursday ruled against the FCC 's policy regulating curse words and nudity on broadcast television .\nIn an 8-0 decision , the high court threw out fines and sanctions imposed by the Federal Communications Commission . The case involved some uncensored curse words and brief nudity on various networks , including Fox .\n`` Because the FCC failed to give FOX or ABC fair notice prior to the broadcasts in question that fleeting expletives and momentary nudity could be found actionably indecent , the Commissions ' standards as applied to these broadcasts were vague , '' the Supreme Court said in its opinion .\nThe court said the FCC is `` free to modify its current indecency policy '' in light of the ruling .\nThe justices , though , declined to issue a broad ruling on the constitutionality of the FCC indecency policy . Instead , the court concluded only that broadcasters could not have known in advance that obscenities uttered during awards show programs and a brief display of nudity on an episode of ABC 's NYPD Blue could give rise to sanctions . ABC and 45 affiliates were hit with proposed fines totaling nearly $ 1.24 million .\nIt was the second time the court has confronted , but not ruled conclusively on , the FCC 's policy on isolated expletives . Justice Anthony Kennedy said in his opinion for the court that `` it is unnecessary for the court to address the constitutionality of the current policy . ''\nThe case arose from a change in the FCC 's long-standing policy on curse words . For many years , the agency did not take action against broadcasters for one-time uses of curse words . But , following several awards shows with cursing celebrities in 2002 and 2003 , the FCC toughened its policy after it concluded that a one-free-expletive rule did not make sense in the context of keeping the air waves free of indecency when children are likely to be watching television .\nBut Kennedy said the commission did not adequately explain that under the new policy `` a fleeting expletive or a brief shot of nudity could be actionably indecent . ''\nThe stepped-up indecency enforcement , including issuing record fines for violations , also was spurred in part by widespread public outrage following Janet Jackson 's breast-baring performance during the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show .\nThat incident , and the FCC 's proposed fine of $ 550,000 , are not part of the current case . The government has an appeal pending of a lower court ruling that threw out the fine in that case .\nThe material at issue in Thursday 's decision includes the isolated use of expletives as well as fines against broadcasters who showed a woman 's nude buttocks on a 2003 episode of the show `` NYPD Blue . ''\nIn December 2002 , singer Cher used the phrase `` F -- - ` em '' during the Billboard Music Awards show on the Fox television network . A month later , U2 lead singer Bono uttered the phrase `` f -- -- -- brilliant '' during NBC 's broadcast of the Golden Globes awards show . In the December 2003 Billboard awards show on Fox , reality show star Nicole Richie said , `` Have you ever tried to get cow s -- - out of a Prada purse ? It 's not so f -- -- -- simple . ''\nBut the challenge went beyond just the penalties for the use of fleeting expletives . The broadcasters wanted the court to free them from all regulation of content around the clock . The court 's 1978 Pacifica decision upheld the FCC 's reprimand of a New York radio station for airing a George Carlin monologue containing a 12-minute string of expletives in the middle of the afternoon .\nThe broadcasters argued that the revolution in technology that has brought the Internet , satellite television and cable makes even the old rules obsolete . The regulations only apply to broadcast channels .\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in a brief opinion that she would have overturned the Pacifica ruling , which she called wrong even when it was decided .
