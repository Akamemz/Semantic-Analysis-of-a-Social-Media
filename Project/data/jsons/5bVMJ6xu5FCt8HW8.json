    "content": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg arrived Monday on Capitol Hill contrite and apologetic , ahead of an expected grilling later this week before Congress -- and the threat of regulations -- after the social media giant allowed a data-mining company to get the personal information from at least 87 million users .\n\u201c Looking back , it 's clear we were too slow identifying election interference in 2016 , and we need to do better in future elections , \u201d Zuckerberg said in an open letter posted on Facebook to its 2.2 billion users minutes before he met privately with senators .\nIn his first meeting Monday , Zuckerberg entered and exited a one-hour talk with Florida Democratic Sen.
