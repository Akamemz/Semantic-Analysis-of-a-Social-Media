    "content_original": "The online mob came for Harald Uhlig.\n\nWhat terrible thing had he done? As I show in my new video, he tweeted that Black Lives Matter \"torpedoed itself, with its full-fledged support of #defundthepolice.\" Instead of defunding, Uhlig suggested, \"train them better.\"\n\nHundreds of people then signed a petition to demand that Uhlig, a University of Chicago professor and head of the Journal of Political Economy, resign. Even prominent economists like Janet Yellen and Paul Krugman joined the mob. Krugman called Uhlig \"another privileged white man who evidently cannot control his urge to belittle the concerns of those less fortunate.\"\n\nBut that's just a lie. Uhlig wasn't belittling concerns of anyone less fortunate.\n\n\"There was nothing racist or discriminatory in how he said it,\" says Reason magazine senior editor Robby Soave, who covers the new \"woke\" protests. \"But because he has some different views from the protesters, he must be a racist.\"\n\nUhlig was placed on leave by the journal he ran.\n\nThe new totalitarians demand that no one criticize their view of the world.\n\nThe online mob even attacks its fellow Democrats.\n\nDavid Shor, an analyst at Democratic polling firm Civis Analytics, tweeted a study that concluded, \"race riots reduced Democratic vote share.\"\n\nThat study was probably accurate. Obviously, rioting alienates voters.\n\nBut the mob attacked Shor. \"Come get your boy,\" one tweeted.\n\nHis bosses did. Even though Shor issued a groveling apology, he was fired.\n\nSoave points out, \"There's a cruel streak in activism that says, 'If you disagree with me\u2026you have no right to speak.'\"\n\n\"Why are they winning?\" I ask. \"Their argument is ridiculous.\"\n\n\"People are afraid to challenge them,\" explains Soave. \"It just takes one employee at one company, to say, 'Here's the law that protects my rights to feel safe and comfortable in this workplace. If you're not making me feel safe and comfortable, I'm going to get you in trouble.'\"\n\nSo cowardly corporations cave.\n\nA Boeing executive was even forced out for opposing women's service in the military\u201430 years ago.\n\nA Los Angeles soccer team fired a player because his wife posted racist comments.\n\nMichigan State pushed out a physicist when a twitter mob from its \"Graduate Employees Union\" labeled him a \"scientific racist.\" What racist thing had the physicist done? He \"rejects the idea that scientists should categorically exclude the possibility of average genetic differences among groups,\" is how a Wall Street Journal column explained it.\n\nNow \"cancel culture\" has moved abroad.\n\nHarry Potter author J.K. Rowling is being smeared as \"transphobic.\" When a tax researcher was fired for saying, \"Identifying as a woman does not make a person a woman,\" Rowling tweeted, incredulously, \"Force women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real?\"\n\nShe said she has nothing against trans people, but she's \"concerned about the huge explosion in young women wishing to transition.\"\n\nThe Twitter mob claimed her \"hate\" was \"killing trans people.\"\n\nSome staff at Hachette, her publisher, refused to work on her next book.

The school, after a 10-day investigation, announced there was \"no basis\" for taking away Harold Uhlig's job. He's been reinstated.\n\nThat's how these cases should be handled.\n\n\"The solution is to challenge these people,\" says Soave. \"We just have to speak up.\"\n\nThose of us who can, must.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2020 BY JFS PRODUCTIONS INC.\n\nDISTRIBUTED BY CREATORS.COM",
