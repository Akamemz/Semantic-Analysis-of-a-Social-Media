He told the authorities that he needed a revolver for self-defense. While tending to his 20 acres of land, he often had to walk long hours to reach home after nightfall. He wanted to protect himself from wild animals and bands of armed robbers.\n\nOnce the background checks were completed in June this year, Singh was told he had to fulfill one more condition to get his gun.\n\nHe had to submit two photos: One showing him planting 10 saplings on his property, and then another with the thriving trees one month later.\n\nTo mark World Environment Day in June, Chander Gaind had an idea.
