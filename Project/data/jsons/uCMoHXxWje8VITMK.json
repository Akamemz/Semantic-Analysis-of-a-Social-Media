    "content": "When Donald Trump said in late January that America should have \u201c kept the oil \u201d after invading Iraq \u2014 \u201c To the victor go the spoils , \u201d he declared \u2014 foreign governments were horrified .\nBut one country is now actively promoting its natural resources to win Trump \u2019 s attention for its desperate cause : Afghanistan . The government , led by President Ashraf Ghani , has pitched Trump on its vast mineral reserves in an effort to keep the new president invested in the country \u2019 s fate .\nAfghanistan \u2019 s improbable investment pitch is a sign of a new Trump-era mind-set , in which foreign leaders are selling their nations in more explicitly economic terms than ever before .\nAfghan officials say Trump , a veteran deal-maker , appears to be listening . \u201c This is the first administration that is focused on Afghanistan \u2019 s economic potential , and we welcome that , \u201d said Hamdullah Mohib , Afghanistan \u2019 s ambassador to Washington .\nIn a Dec. 3 phone call , Trump and Ghani discussed Afghanistan \u2019 s mineral wealth , whose value a Pentagon study has estimated at up to $ 1 trillion . An official Afghan readout of the call said that Trump told Ghani the U.S. wants to help Afghanistan develop its \u201c tremendous natural resources . \u201d\nPerhaps the most notable of Afghanistan \u2019 s buried treasures are its large quantities of lithium , a silvery , soft metal crucial to laptop and cellphone batteries that \u2019 s sometimes called the oil of the future . A 2010 Pentagon memo concluded that Afghanistan could one day become \u201c the Saudi Arabia of lithium . \u201d\nWhile few people associate impoverished and war-torn Afghanistan with high technology manufacturing , Kabul \u2019 s leaders believe they have a receptive audience in the White House . Trump officials , Mohib added , \u201c are interested in minerals \u2014 specifically lithium . \u201d\n\u201c They \u2019 re recognizing that Afghanistan has very vast potential resources , \u201d said Mohammad Qayoumi , a top adviser to Ghani .\nMohib \u2019 s government is hardly offering to let the U.S. seize its precious minerals . But as Afghan leaders fight for survival against the Taliban , they want Trump to see their country as a business opportunity \u2014 not the expensive quagmire that led him to tweet in 2013 that the U.S. should abandon Afghanistan \u201c immediately . \u201d\nOther countries are trying out their own pitches . Japan \u2019 s prime minister has presented Trump a plan to create 700,000 new jobs through joint projects . European diplomats are touting trans-Atlantic commerce and job creation . Even Iraqi officials are promoting the value of their oil industry for U.S. investment , though they adamantly reject Trump \u2019 s \u201c take the oil \u201d bluster .\n\u201c All foreign leaders are thinking , what do we play up to get this president \u2019 s attention ? \u201d said one Trump administration official .\nThe question is particularly acute for the Afghan government , which has proved unable to defeat a 15-year Taliban insurgency , and , more recently , a nascent Islamic State . Without continued U.S. support , Afghanistan \u2019 s government is at severe risk of collapse .\nOn Wednesday , at least 30 people were killed in an Islamic State attack on a military hospital in Kabul . Last month , the top U.S. general in Afghanistan told Congress he needs \u201c a few thousand \u201d more troops , in addition to the 8,400 American soldiers already there , to back up Afghan security forces suffering horrendous battlefield losses .\n\u201c If I \u2019 m Ghani and I want continued U.S. engagement , and Trump has said things like , \u2018 We \u2019 ve got to get the hell out of that place \u2019 \u2014 how do I get his attention ? \u201d said a former senior Obama White House official .\nGhani understands that mineral wealth \u201c can help Trump have a different narrative for engagement in Afghanistan , \u201d he added .\nA Trump National Security Council official said the Trump administration has begun a review of U.S. policy in Afghanistan . \u201c As a dynamic results-oriented president from the business world , he \u2019 s going to look at everything with a fresh set of eyes , \u201d he said .\nThe official noted that the World Bank and others have called \u201c the proper development of Afghanistan \u2019 s extractives sector \u201d key to the country \u2019 s self-reliance .\nThough Trump has made few public comments about Afghanistan , officials there are mindful that he has scoffed at the costly American effort in their country , launched soon after the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks , and which cost the U.S. 10 combat deaths and $ 3.8 billion in military aid last year .\n\u201c We should leave Afghanistan immediately . No more wasted lives . If we have to go back in , we go in hard & quick . Rebuild the US first , \u201d Trump tweeted in March 2013 .\nSince then , Trump has grudgingly acknowledged the value of a U.S. presence in the country . \u201c I hate doing it . I hate doing it so much , \u201d he told Fox News in April . \u201c But , again , you have nuclear weapons in Pakistan , so I would do it . \u201d\nBut at other times , Trump has cited the value of Afghanistan \u2019 s soil and rock . \u201c Afghanistan has tremendous minerals , which a lot of people do n't know , \u201d Trump said on NBC \u2019 s \u201c Meet the Press \u201d in August 2015 .\n\u201c Nobody knew this , but Afghanistan is rich with minerals , \u201d Trump told the talk radio host Alex Jones that December . \u201c Not oil , but minerals . \u201d\nIn fact , Afghan minerals have been much discussed at least since a widely reported 2010 Pentagon memo , developed with the help of government geologists , estimated their value at up to $ 1 trillion . The memo revealed \u201c stunning potential , \u201d Gen. David Petraeus , then the top U.S. commander in the country , told The New York Times .\nOf particular value is lithium , whose value has soared thanks to surging demand for rechargeable batteries to power everything from iPhones to electric cars . Lithium \u2019 s unusual properties cause it to sizzle and smoke when water is poured over it , and it is light enough to float in small quantities .\nMany former U.S. officials and other Afghanistan experts warn that Afghanistan \u2019 s minerals may just be a modern twist on the old myth of El Dorado , the lost South American city of gold . Afghanistan has weak governance and rampant corruption and lacks the road and rail infrastructure , never mind the security conditions , required for a thriving industrial sector .\n\u201c It \u2019 s such an unknown . That is a fool \u2019 s errand , \u201d said a former senior Obama official who handled Afghanistan policy . Any potential mining benefits \u201c are decades down the road , \u201d he added .\nOthers warned that even the perception of a U.S. profit motive in Afghanistan could enrage the country \u2019 s population and fuel further insurgency .\n\u201c The more this is about taking their resources for us , the harder it is to argue that the U.S. presence in Afghanistan is not a version of a colonial enterprise , \u201d said Sarah Chayes , an Afghanistan expert who served as an adviser to former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Michael Mullen .\nChayes , author of `` Thieves of State : Why Corruption Threatens Global Security , '' also warned that a rush to extract minerals would breed corruption .\nThat risk is likely clear to Trump \u2019 s new national security adviser , Lt. Gen. H.R . McMaster , who served on an anti-corruption task force during Petraeus \u2019 tenure in Afghanistan several years ago . McMaster also spoke by phone with Ghani soon after assuming his job .\nStoking Trump \u2019 s interest in Afghanistan is the specter of competition from China , which in recent years has begun major mining operations in the country \u2014 including a $ 3 billion copper mine opened in 2008 but since plagued by security problems .\n\u201c We \u2019 re here fighting , and China is taking out all the minerals , \u201d Trump said in his \u201c Meet the Press \u201d appearance .\n`` We go into Afghanistan .
