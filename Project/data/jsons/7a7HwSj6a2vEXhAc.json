Jeb Bush , author of a new book on immigration , tells \u2588\u2588\u2588 that America \u2019 s \u201c incredibly complex \u201d immigration laws should be reformed \u201c from stem to stern \u201d with an eye toward attracting and retaining more skilled workers from other nations.Immigration is also one of the topics discussed in the cover story Bush wrote for the April edition of \u2588\u2588\u2588 magazine , Some critics have said that in his new book \u201c The Immigration Wars : Forging an American Solution \u201d \u2014 co-written with constitutional law expert Clint Bolick \u2014 Bush reverses his position on illegal immigrants and maintains that he opposes a pathway to citizenship for those who entered the United States illegally and remain in the country.In an exclusive interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 TV , Bush addresses that criticism : \u201c It \u2019 s safe to say that there was a rush to criticize early when the book hadn \u2019 t been published and people were opining on it . If people get a chance to read the book , they \u2019 ll find that this is a comprehensive set of solutions . There \u2019 s not one element of it that you can look at , it \u2019 s got to be looked at in its entirety. \u201c The basic principle underlining our set of recommendations is that legal immigration should be easier , less costly , and done over a shorter period of time . There should be incentives for people to come legally and the cost of coming illegally should be higher. \u201c If you have that then people will want to come legally and they can make a contribution , a full contribution to our economy . We \u2019 re basically advocating a shift towards an economy-driven immigration strategy where we focus on economic growth being the principle reason why we need to reform our immigration system stem to stern. \u201d Bush says we should re-examine our \u201c family reunification \u201d policy , which allows many immigrants who establish themselves here to bring members of their extended family into the country legally. \u201c Family reunification is a noble tradition but what \u2019 s happened is we have what \u2019 s called the chain migration effect \u2014 67 to 75 percent of all legal visa holders come through family reunification . Only 13 percent come for economic purposes . Canada , our neighbor , has the exact opposite \u2014 about 15 percent who come through family and about 75 to 80 percent who come for economic purposes . We \u2019 re suggesting we should move toward the Canadian model and still be true to our heritage as a nation , being a nation of immigrants. \u201d He asserts that U.S. immigration policy should \u201c narrow the definition \u201d of which family members qualify for reunification , \u201c narrowing it down to what people think it is , which is spouses and minor children. \u201c If you did that you \u2019 d probably free up 500,000 slots a year that would then allow you to create legal immigration for people that want to come to work . You could create a guest worker program , you could expand H-1B visas , you could give people green cards . If the demands in the economy seeking high-skilled labor existed , you could expand dramatically the economic side of immigration and it would create at least an additional 1 percent growth in our economy , and the good Lord knows we need that. \u201d Bush writes in his \u2588\u2588\u2588 magazine article that \u201c today \u2019 s immigration laws are written for another century in a different kind of economy. \u201d One policy that brings to mind is the \u201c wet foot , dry foot \u201d policy that allows those who flee Cuba and reach American soil to remain in the country.Asked if this policy needs to be revisited , Bush responds : \u201c I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s being revisited in Congress right now . Clearly if the United States \u2019 relationship with Cuba changed , which would require a regime change inside Cuba , if Cuba moved towards a more democratic approach to governance rather than this despotic rule of tyranny , if they moved towards the systems that have created more economic prosperity , then our immigration laws would change accordingly. \u201d Bush agrees that the policy gives an advantage to Cubans : \u201c It \u2019 s clearly unique . There is no other country that has the Cuban Adjustment Act ; that \u2019 s why it \u2019 s called the Cuban Adjustment Act and not the Nicaraguan Adjustment Act. \u201c We have incredibly complex immigration laws and we should review all the laws from stem to stern to move into the 21st century. \u201d As for specific immigration policies that trouble Bush , he tells \u2588\u2588\u2588 : \u201c You have the temporarily protective status , which was temporarily granted for example for Central Americans : El Salvadorans , Hondurans , Nicaraguans , in the 1980s . We have millions of people that are under this temporary protective status permanently. \u201c We should at some point recognize that that \u2019 s the case , that their children and they themselves after 20 , 25 years are American . They \u2019 re here legally , they work , they embrace American values , but they have this temporary status that needs to be adjusted. \u201c The idea that we need a guest worker program , which we \u2019 ve had with great success in our past , is another example of a change that would be appropriate. \u201d He also believes that U.S. policy forces some highly skilled foreigners to leave the country after several years , in many cases after they have obtained an American education. \u201c Some of them come with the skills and they have a three-to-six-year period where they can work and once that work time expires they \u2019 re not allowed to stay in the country. \u201c We train them , we may educate them as well , and then send them off to compete with us. \u201c People are very pessimistic , uncharacteristically so for Americans , but America still is the land of opportunity and high-achieving people with great aspirations should be able to come if they can make an immediate contribution to our economy . That \u2019 s where the focus needs to be and where the policy makers in Washington seem to be making pretty good progress . \u201d",
