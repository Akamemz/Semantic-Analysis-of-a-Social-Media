    "content": "Both the New York Times and CNN have deliberately misled readers about two sexual harassment-related formal rebukes issued by the House Ethics Committee on Friday .\nIn the case of the Times , the newspaper hid the fact that the rebukes addressed one Republican and one Democrat ( guess which part they hid ) , and in the case of CNN , the network attempted to smear the Republican as being charged with sexual harassment himself ( he was n't . )\nAlyssa Farah , press secretary to Vice President Mike Pence , caught it , and said so on her personal Twitter account .\nStaring with CNN , which committed an arguably lesser offense , here are screenshots of the tweet and the article .\nThis obviously implies to sexual harassment offenses committed by two men . That is not , however , the case . This is from the second paragraph of the article ( which placement is why it 's arguably a lesser offense ) :\nRepublican Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina was cited for `` failure to take prompt and decisive action to deal with the alleged sexual harassment in his congressional office '' and Democratic Rep. Ruben Kihuen of Nevada for making `` persistent and unwanted advances towards women who were required to interact with him as part of their professional responsibilities . ''\nRepublican Meadows was reprimanded for failing to take prompt and decisive action over someone else 's offense ; Democrat Kihuen for making advances and committed offenses himself . And although we here are aware of the circumstance , even that explantory paragraph is less than clear . Although it says `` failure to take prompt and decisive action '' it does not actually spell out that it was n't his behavior that required action .\nThis headline is misleading - so let me clear it up : Meadows never sexually harassed anyone . His former staffer did . I know , I am 1 of the women in the report . I respect the Ethics Cmte but my experience was that Meadows had my back , took me at my word , & respected & protected me https : //t.co/domQmTsohf \u2014 Alyssa Farah ( @ Alyssafarah ) November 17 , 2018\nFarah is one of the women in the report that was issued . So to be clear , one of the complainants had to now complain about the coverage of her complaint , because CNN .\nThe New York Times decided to bypass being misleading and opt instead for just missing and leaving out . Here are their screenshots :\nYou may notice the distinct lack of the words `` Democrat '' , `` two '' , and `` Democratic Rep. Ruben Kihuen of Nevada . '' You have to go pretty far into the article to find any of them . In fact , as Newbusters counted out , you have to go to the 10th paragraph to find any mention of the Democrat who actually sexually harassed someone .\nThe committee also released a report on Friday reproving Representative Ruben Kihuen , Democrat of Nevada . Mr. Kihuen , a freshman lawmaker , did not seek re-election after Buzzfeed News reported that he had repeatedly harassed and made sexual advances toward his finance director .
