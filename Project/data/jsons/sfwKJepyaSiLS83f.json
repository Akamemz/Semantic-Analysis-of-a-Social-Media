Is there something about her candidacy that Democrats don \u2019 t like or trust ? Why , for that matter , are so many Democratic partisans in the state wallowing in uncertainty and indecision ? As WMUR \u2019 s Paul McMorrow recently explained , Coakley has a slight problem on her hands :\nSix weeks of WBUR tracking polls in the race for governor show Coakley struggling to rally the Democratic base to her side . The most recent WBUR poll showed Coakley garnering support from just 62 percent of Democrats ( not including leaners ) . Coakley \u2019 s standing among registered Democrats has barely moved since the end of August , when she was polling at 63 percent among Democrats in a matchup against Baker . It \u2019 s not that Baker has made significant inroads among Democrats : In August , he was winning 11 percent of the Democratic vote , and in last week \u2019 s poll , he was capturing 15 percent . ( Baker took 14 percent of the Democratic vote against Patrick in 2010 . ) But since the end of the summer , one-fifth of Democratic voters have been sitting on the fence , undecided between Coakley and Baker . The longer they stay away from home , the tougher Coakley \u2019 s path to victory gets . Democratic voters have been unusually cool to their party \u2019 s nominee this year . At this point in the Warren-Brown Senate race , a WBUR poll had Warren up among Democrats , 72 to 21 , with just 7 percent of Democrats undecided . A Suffolk University survey in late September 2012 showed Warren capturing 81 percent of the Democratic vote , with 6 percent undecided . Compared to those two data points , Coakley \u2019 s inability to consolidate the Democratic vote looms large . Her current deficit among independents is in line with the figures Patrick and Warren posted against Baker and Brown . But Coakley can \u2019 t afford to concede scores of unenrolled voters to Baker if she can \u2019 t make up the difference with a lopsided victory among Democrats .\nIn other words , if Democrats abandon her at the polls , she \u2019 s probably going to lose . This is why she can not allow Democrats to sit at home and wait for Elizabeth Warren to run for president before they vote again . Worse , Rasmussen Reports \u2019 hot-off-the-press survey released today ( unlike WBUR \u2019 s offering yesterday ) shows her already losing :\nA new Rasmussen Reports statewide telephone survey of Likely Massachusetts Voters finds Republican Charlie Baker picking up 48 % of the vote to Democratic Attorney General Martha Coakley \u2019 46 % . Two percent ( 2 % ) prefer some other candidate , while five percent ( 5 % ) are undecided .
