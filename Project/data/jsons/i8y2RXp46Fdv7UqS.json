Kevin McCarthy \u2019 s abrupt and shocking ( well , not that shocking ) withdrawal from the race to succeed John Boehner has raised an existential question the ochre Ohioan himself always asked rebellious members : Who the hell would want this job ?\nWe have our answer . Nobody with the slightest sense of political self-preservation or the scantest hope of having a future . McCarthy ( looking ten years older than he did a week ago ) used English words to explain his \u2018 later-for-you statement ( \u201c If we 're going to unite and be strong , we need a new face to do that '' ) but had he answered in song , it would have been \u201c zip-a-dee-doo-dah ! \u201d Stunned members were said to be openly weeping in the cloakroom , but nary one of the tear-soaked super-majority was rushing to raise his hands shouting \u201c Pick Me ! Pick me ! \u201d\nWhen asked if he was interested in the gig , Rep. Mac Thornberry , conservative from Texas cattle country , told reporters on the Hill , `` I 'd rather be a vegetarian . \u201d\nThis is because the overstuffed 247-member House majority ( brilliantly secured in perpetuity by Bush-era electoral gerrymandering ) is , like New York in the 1970s or the Washington Nationals right now , essentially ungovernable .\nHere are five reasons why only a fool , hero , caretaker ( or some combination of all ) would want the job Boehner dearly hopes to vacate by month \u2019 s end , but can \u2019 t .\n1 . Ted Cruz is running for president . It \u2019 s been jokingly said that the Texas tea party god , who often crossed the rotunda to whip up ultra-conservatives against Boehner \u2019 s budget deals , is \u201c Speaker Cruz. \u201d He \u2019 s lashed Boehner as a sell-out and cheered the 2013 government shutdown , and even with his nemesis gone , Cruz is going to continue to barbecue the GOP \u201c establishment \u201d \u2013 i.e . anybody who has a job that requires them to compromise with the White House . And that \u2019 s basically the job description .\nMoreover , bashing Congress is the mouth-breathing of political discourse , anyone can do it , and often does . At present , the overall Congressional approval rating is about 16 percent \u2013 and that \u2019 s pretty good , considering it touched high single digits in recent years . Donald Trump , who had no particular beef with McCarthy but is on good terms with Cruz , offered a don \u2019 t-let-the-door-hit-you tweet because , you know , why not ? \u201c Great , Kevin McCarthy drops out of SPEAKER race . We need a really smart and really tough person to take over this very important job ! \u201d he wrote before suggesting his daughter Ivanka take the job .\nPresumably , he loves her too much to have been serious .\n2 . The \u201c catastrophic \u201d 2013 government shutdown didn \u2019 t scare the tea party . Boehner , who had a Midwestern plastic salesman \u2019 s love for a folksy maxim , was fond of saying that the tea party wing of his party would recede once they had \u201c touched the stove \u201d \u2013 by shutting down the government .\nNope . Cruz delivered his celebrated semi-filibuster against Obamacare , and his members scuttled attempts to cut a stopgap deal with the White House . After a 16-day shutdown , the two sides agreed to a short-term funding deal \u2013 with polls showing 8 in 10 Americans blamed Republicans for the disruption , with tea party support tanking nationally .\nDemocrats predicted the GOP would pay a steep price for their recklessness in the 2014 elections . Not only were the wrong , they were historically wrong : Midterms are , by their nature , base elections , so fired-up anti-Obama Republicans romped , picking up nine Senate seats and the majority . They added 13 new members in the allegedly disgraced House , achieving a commanding majority the likes of which hadn \u2019 t been seen since Hoover \u2019 s day . Instead of touching the stove \u2013 they tossed it at Boehner \u2019 s head . When Phillip Bump of the Washington Post analyzed the post-shutdown polling , he concluded \u201c if there is a repeat of the government shutdown , how it affects 2016 -- if at all -- is probably impossible to predict . \u201d\n3 . If you have any chance of winning , you 're automatically the \u201c establishment. \u201d McCarthy is safely in the red zone of any standard definition of \u201c conservative \u201d but to his party \u2019 s right wing , he might as well have been King Boehner II . The tea party , fresh off deposing the last speaker , was leery of anybody who followed the pre-ordained lines of succession \u2013 despite McCarthy \u2019 s reputation as glad-handing bridge builder willing to hear out their complaints .
