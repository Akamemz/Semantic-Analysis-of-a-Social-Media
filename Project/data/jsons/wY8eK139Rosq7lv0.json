Since then , his administration has struggled to articulate a clear plan\nConfused by Donald Trump \u2019 s policy on Syria ? That just means you \u2019 ve been listening to what his administration has been saying in the last few days .\nThe US secretary of state , Rex Tillerson , is to fly to Moscow on Tuesday , where the novice US diplomat is expected to discuss the fate of Bashar al-Assad . Meanwhile , the world is still trying to understand just what goal Trump \u2019 s fledgling administration is pursuing in Syria .\nFor years , Trump advocated against intervention in Syria \u2019 s war , except to attack the Islamic State militant group in a related but separate conflict . That policy seemed to end on Thursday , after the chemical weapons attack on Khan Sheikhoun on 4 April . Yet almost as soon as Trump ordered retaliatory strikes on a Syrian airbase from which the US said the regime had launched the chemical attack , his aides suggested that the one-off strike had satisfied US objectives .\nIt may not be clear what the US policy toward Syria actually is , including to senior policymakers whose divergent and even contradictory statements have overlapped with one another . But here , at least , is what they have said .\nPolicy 1 \u2013 Assad can stay : 2013 \u2013 30 March 2017\nFor years , as a private citizen on Twitter and as a presidential candidate , Trump was fine with Assad remaining in power , contending that the US should not get sucked into another Middle Eastern conflict , particularly one against a leader backed by Russia . After winning the election , Trump told the Wall Street Journal : \u201c My attitude was you \u2019 re fighting Syria , Syria is fighting Isis , and you have to get rid of Isis. \u201d Assad quickly called Trump a \u201c natural ally \u201d .\nOn 30 March , Trump \u2019 s senior diplomats articulated that position clearly . Nikki Haley , the US ambassador to the United Nations , mused that the US needed to \u201c pick and choose [ its ] battles \u201d , despite Assad \u2019 s human rights abuses : \u201c Our priority is no longer to sit and focus on getting Assad out . \u201d\n'The dead were wherever you looked ' : inside Syrian town after chemical attack Read more\nThat same day , in Turkey , Tillerson said Assad \u2019 s \u201c longer-term status ... will be decided by the Syrian people \u201d .\nSince the Syrian people live in one of the world \u2019 s bloodiest war zones , besieged by Assad \u2019 s forces and others , observers understood Tillerson and Haley to say that the US was abandoning Barack Obama \u2019 s rhetorical commitment to Assad \u2019 s removal . Senator John McCain , a hawk on Syria , called himself \u201c deeply disturbed \u201d by Tillerson and Haley \u2019 s position .\n\u201c Ultimately , the administration \u2019 s statements today could lead America \u2019 s true allies and partners in the fight against Isis to fear the worst : a Faustian bargain with Assad and Putin sealed with an empty promise of counter-terrorism cooperation , \u201d McCain said .\nFive days later , Assad killed at least 70 people in Khan Sheikhoun , including children , with the nerve agent sarin .\nPolicy 2 \u2013 Assad must go , after chemical attack : 5-6 April 2017\nBy Wednesday , the first day dominated by images of the dead at Khan Sheikhoun , Trump expressed public anger , saying Assad had crossed \u201c many , many lines \u201d . By then , military planning for a retaliatory strike was under way .\nBut what was the objective of the strike ? Hours before guided-missile destroyers launched 59 Tomahawk missiles on Thursday , Tillerson indicated that Trump had reversed himself completely . Tillerson certainly had .\n\u201c Assad \u2019 s role in the future is uncertain , clearly . With the acts that he has taken , it would seem that there would be no role for him to govern the Syrian people , \u201d he said . Asked if the US was prepared to diplomatically rally an international coalition to remove Assad from power through what Tillerson called \u201c a political process \u201d , Tillerson responded : \u201c Those steps are under way . \u201d\nThe missiles that soon landed on the Shayrat airbase seemed , accordingly , to mark the first salvo toward the US ousting Assad .\nPolicy 3 \u2013 The issue is chemical weapons use , not Assad : 6-10 April 2017\nHours after the missile strike , the newly empowered national security adviser HR McMaster , whose career was made by a different Middle Eastern war , defined the US attack in minimalist terms : \u201c It was aimed at the capacity to commit mass murder with chemical weapons , but it was not of a scope or a scale that it would go after all such related facilities. \u201d Next to McMaster , Tillerson said the chemical attack was \u201c particular [ ly ] heinous \u201d , over and above Assad \u2019 s brutality with conventional weapons .\nNotably absent from McMaster \u2019 s explanation of the strikes was any indication of whether Assad \u2019 s removal was a US objective at all . ( The strike itself would not have affected Assad \u2019 s hold on power , but if endangering that hold were once again a US goal , it would have to be the first of many . ) Instead , McMaster said , the strike ought to prompt \u201c a big shift in Assad \u2019 s calculus \u201d against chemical weapons use . Assad \u2019 s calculus , however , should not matter to the US if he is no longer in power .\nOn 10 April , the US defense secretary , James Mattis , issued a statement similar to that of his ally McMaster : \u201c The Syrian government would be ill-advised ever again to use chemical weapons. \u201d But that was after several statements with different policy implications .\nPolicy 4 \u2013 Attack Isis first , then Assad can stay or go depending on whether Russia agrees : 9 April 2017\nTillerson , making his first appearance on the Sunday chatshows , sounded more like his 30 March self than his 6 April incarnation . \u201c Our priority is first the defeat of Isis , \u201d he said \u2013 which , in fairness , he had also said on 6 April in what seemed like a throwaway line . Once the US could \u201c conclude \u201d that war , the US would attempt to broker ceasefire agreements between the Syrian civil war \u2019 s various combatants \u2013 even though Assad , with Russian support , has violated ceasefires in the past .\nTillerson said he was \u201c hopeful \u201d to work with Russia \u201c and use their influence to achieve areas of stabilization throughout Syria and create the conditions for a political process through Geneva in which we can engage all of the parties on a way forward \u201d .\nThrough that process \u2013 apparently not yet \u201c under way \u201d , despite Tillerson \u2019 s 6 April statement \u2013 the international community would \u201c decide the fate of Bashar Assad \u201d .\nNothing about Tillerson \u2019 s statement implied that Assad \u2019 s \u201c fate \u201d would be to leave power . The \u201c areas of stabilization \u201d in Syria that Russia has facilitated have propped Assad up , and Russia has shown no signs of abandoning its client . Nor did Tillerson define when the US would \u201c conclude \u201d its war against Isis .\nBeyond that , Tillerson implied that overthrowing Assad would be disastrous , citing Obama \u2019 s adventurism in Libya that toppled Muammar Gaddafi : \u201c Any time you go in and have a violent change at the top , it is very difficult to create the conditions for stability longer-term . \u201d\nBut if Tillerson was again prizing stability over regime change , Haley was doing the opposite .\nHaley , reversing her own 30 March statement thoroughly , said the US could have \u201c multiple priorities \u201d in Syria beyond defeating Isis . She agreed with Tillerson on the importance of \u201c the political solution \u201d , but filled in the blanks on where the US wanted it to end up : \u201c In no way do we see peace in that area with Assad as the head of the Syrian government , and we have to make sure that we \u2019 re pushing that process . The political solution has to come together for the good of the people of Syria . \u201d\nThe message to Russia , Haley told NBC , was : \u201c We \u2019 re not going to allow you to cover up for this regime anymore . \u201d\nMcMaster , in an interview with Fox News , seemed to back Haley \u2019 s vision of US diplomacy for Syria , all while placing the onus for Assad \u2019 s fate on Russia .\n\u201c It \u2019 s very difficult to understand how a political solution could result from the continuation of the Assad regime . Now , we are not saying that we are the ones who are going to effect that change , \u201d McMaster said , saying Russia had to ask \u201c hard questions \u201d about \u201c are we supporting this murderous regime that is committing mass murder of its own population and using the most heinous weapons available ? \u201d\nMuddying the waters of Tillerson \u2019 s Isis-first approach , McMaster said : \u201c There has to be a degree of simultaneous activity as well as sequencing of the defeat of Isis first . \u201d\nAsked why the US drew the line at chemical weapons , rather than the barrel bombs Assad \u2019 s forces have used to kill countless more Syrian civilians , Haley replied : \u201c That \u2019 s a decision for the president to make. \u201d McMaster , asked the same question , agreed : \u201c The president will make whatever decision he thinks is in the best interest of the American people . \u201d\nPolicy 5 \u2013 The US will respond militarily to barrel bombs : 10 April\nSean Spicer , the White House press secretary , on Monday implied Trump had made the decision to which Haley and McMaster alluded . Now the US placed barrel bombs along the continuum with chemical weapons . Since the US had responded to chemical weapons with Tomahawk missiles , Spicer \u2019 s comments suggested an even deeper US military engagement in Syria unrelated to chemical weapons , even as McMaster had defined the strike in a manner that suggested the US merely sought to establish a credible deterrent against future chemical weapons use .\n\u201c The sight of people being gassed and blown away by barrel bombs ensures that if we see this kind of action again , we hold open the possibility of future action , \u201d Spicer said , reading from prepared \u2013 presumably deliberate \u2013 remarks .\nSpicer , following criticism , later said that he only meant to refer to barrel bombs that contained chlorine or other industrial chemicals . But that would still represent a substantial expansion of the US rules of engagement in Syria . The regime is suspected of using chlorine gas in its attacks on at least 16 occasions since 2013 .\nWithin hours , Mattis released a statement once again defining the US objectives minimally \u2013 and with clarity atypical of the Trump administration .\n\u201c The US military strike against Shayrat airfield on April 6 was a measured response to the Syrian government \u2019 s use of chemical weapons , \u201d said Mattis , a veteran of two different Iraq wars and Afghanistan .\n\u201c The president directed this action to deter future use of chemical weapons and to show the United States will not passively stand by while Assad murders innocent people with chemical weapons , which are prohibited by international law and which were declared destroyed . \u201d\nMattis made no mention of barrel bombs , suggesting a less definitive posture than the one Spicer presented .\nIt remains to be seen whether Tillerson will announce a sixth policy for Syria when in Moscow .",
