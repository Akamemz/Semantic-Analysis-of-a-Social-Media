Lindsey Graham ( R-S.C. ) , had spent more than two weeks pushing to reopen the government and then negotiate on border security , only to face repeated rejection by the president and Vice President Mike Pence . So when two votes came before the Senate this week , one on Trump 's plan , the other on a stopgap with no new guaranteed wall money , Portman nearly made a rare break with his party .\n\u201c I considered it , yes , \u201d he said on Friday after the president finally caved on his position that the government would only reopen with a down payment on his wall .\nPortman and most Republicans ultimately stuck with Trump after Pence 's pleas for unity .
