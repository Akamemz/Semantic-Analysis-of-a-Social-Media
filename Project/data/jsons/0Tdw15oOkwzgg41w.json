Ted Cruz made a visit to the U.S.-Mexican border on Friday to criticize the state of border security and to make the case that he , not Donald Trump , is the best candidate to tackle illegal immigration .\nStanding at a low-slung barrier , Mr. Cruz said that \u201c my 5-year-old could climb this in about 3 seconds . \u201d\nMr. Cruz said Mr. Trump has supported \u201c open-border Democrats \u201d in the past . Opposition to illegal immigration has helped propel Mr. Trump to front-runner in the Republican presidential campaign .\nThe March 22 Arizona winner-take-all primary , where 58 delegates are at stake , is Mr. Cruz \u2019 s best shot to blunt Mr. Trump \u2019 s growing momentum . Utah also votes the same day , and Mr. Cruz is headed to Provo and Draper this weekend for a campaign swing .\nOhio Gov . John Kasich , whose more moderate position on immigration makes Arizona a tougher target , is focusing more on Utah \u2019 s caucuses .\nThe two Western contests are also the first Republican votes since Sen. Marco Rubio left the presidential race after losing his home state of Florida to Mr. Trump last week . After Arizona and Utah , the contest moves to Northern states that are considered less hospitable to Mr. Cruz .\nArizona\u2014ground zero in the contentious national debate over how to deal with the illegal immigrants living in the U.S.\u2014is fertile ground for a fight between Messrs. Trump and Cruz over immigration policy . The state was the site of the 2010 fight over SB 1070 , a bill allowing local police to enforce immigration law that was partially invalidated by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2012 .\nMr. Trump has also been endorsed by two popular figures in the state known for their tough stance against illegal immigration , former GOP Gov . Jan Brewer and Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio .\nMr. Cruz on Friday visited near the site where an American rancher was killed under mysterious circumstances . Authorities believe Robert Krentz was killed in 2010 by an illegal immigrant or drug traffickers . His death on his own ranch along the border has become a rallying cry for proponents of stricter border security and a crackdown on the flow of illegal immigrants into the U.S .\nMr. Cruz toured the border with former Texas Gov . Rick Perry , who has endorsed him , and Steve Ronnebeck , an Arizona man whose son was allegedly killed by an illegal immigrant last year .\nMr. Cruz has long called for additional border security , including a wall and extra border patrol agents . A standard applause line at his rallies is his vow to end so-called sanctuary cities\u2014municipalities that tolerate illegal immigration or refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities .\nBut Mr. Trump has dominated on the issue . His signature policy position is to build a border wall and make the Mexican government pay for it . He has also called illegal immigrants \u201c rapists \u201d and \u201c criminals , \u201d and proposed the mass deportation of the roughly 12 million illegal immigrants currently in the U.S .\nThe only recent poll of Arizona shows Mr. Trump with a comfortable but not insurmountable lead in the state .
