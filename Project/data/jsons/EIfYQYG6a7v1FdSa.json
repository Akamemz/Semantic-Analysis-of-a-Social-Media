Mitt Romney likely will focus on military readiness and anti-terrorism efforts. That's what most Americans would expect to hear, given that their country has been involved continuously in overseas combat since the terrorist attacks of 2001.\n\nBut the U.S. role in the world is shaped by much more than just its ability to project military might. Leadership also is defined by economic power, as well as \"soft\" power \u2014 for example, the country's ability to attract and persuade people to adopt American values, according to Joseph Nye, a Harvard professor.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Nye's book Bound to Lead: The Changing Nature of American Power got people talking about the need to further develop economic and soft power.
