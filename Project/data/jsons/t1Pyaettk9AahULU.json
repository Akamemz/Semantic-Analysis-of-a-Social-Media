C\u00e1rdenas for The Texas Tribune/\u2588\u2588\u2588 )\nLocated on the southernmost tip of Texas , the Rio Grande Valley \u2019 s unique terrain has challenged wall builders for nearly two decades . The topography of the Valley includes a wide floodplain that has forced the government to construct barriers inland , on top of a levee system .

Last year , The Washington Post reported that the president \u201c latch ( ed ) on \u201d to Fisher \u2019 s claims of speed and quality and \u201c aggressively pushed \u201d for the firm in conversations with top Homeland Security officials .\nBut Fisher \u2019 s border wall business got off to a rocky start , despite paying a lobbying firm tens of thousands of dollars to push for contracts . In 2017 , the firm , founded in 1952 and best known for large highway projects , had its wall prototype rejected by the Department of Homeland Security . It later attempted to join an elite group of preapproved border wall bidders , but it was again turned down by the Army Corps of Engineers , which said it failed to meet its requirements or obtain the necessary regulatory approvals .\nIn response , Fisher sued the department and was added to the list of preapproved bidders thanks to White House pressure , administration officials told the Post last year .\nFisher was also aided by a close relationship with freshman U.S. Sen. Kevin Cramer , R-N.D. , who advocated for the company with Trump and Trump \u2019 s son-in-law , Jared Kushner . Fisher and family members donated at least $ 24,000 during Cramer \u2019 s victorious 2018 bid , according to campaign finance records . Cramer \u2019 s spokesperson did not return emails for comment .\nFisher \u2019 s ambition was matched by his brashness , another quality that observers say drew him to the president . Last year , he compared traditional government wall building to a horse and carriage . \u201c But I have a Lamborghini , and there \u2019 s gon na be this concrete road , and we can do two hundred miles an hour , not ten , \u201d he told Texas Monthly .\nAs Cramer lobbied for the company , which included bringing Fisher to Trump \u2019 s 2018 State of the Union address , Fisher embarked on two private ventures alongside We Build the Wall , whose board members include immigration hardliners such as former Colorado congressman Tom Tancredo , former Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke and former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach .\nThe first was in a mountainous area of Sunland Park , New Mexico , just outside of El Paso , where a half-mile wall of fencing appeared seemingly overnight to the surprise of local residents around Memorial Day 2019 .\nSunland Park officials temporarily halted the group \u2019 s fence project because it lacked proper building permits , prompting We Build The Wall to launch a campaign to flood town personnel with pushback .\n\u201c So Sunland Park officials support open borders , the sex slaves and illegal drugs coming into their communities ? \u201d Kolfage responded on Twitter , and he directed followers to \u201c burn up the phone lines . \u201d\nSunland Park Mayor Javier Perea said he received several death threats and thousands of messages , some telling him to watch his back and that opposition to the wall is equivalent to treason . \u201c I will support legislation to that effect , \u201d one email read . \u201c I would attend the hangings . \u201d\n\u201c If they had followed the rules from the very beginning , this wouldn \u2019 t have been so much chaos and controversy , \u201d he told \u2588\u2588\u2588 and The Texas Tribune . \u201c But that was not their intention , their intention was to bring attention to the issues and fundraising. \u201d The city ultimately issued the permits and the wall is still standing .\nSix months later , Fisher moved 800 miles east , and as his companies did in Sunland Park , he began building , this time along the sandy banks of the Rio Grande .\nThe $ 42 million project , which included a $ 1.5 million contribution from We Build the Wall , sputtered at the start . As Fisher began clearing a path for the wall , his company was sued by the federal government and a neighboring wildlife refuge in December .\nThe National Butterfly Center and the International Boundary and Water Commission brought Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. and its subsidiaries to court to stop it from building the fence until it submitted a detailed engineering study to determine the fence \u2019 s impact on the flow of the Rio Grande and nearby properties .\nThe IBWC is a binational body that regulates building in the floodplain between the U.S. and Mexico because structures can worsen flooding and alter the course of the river , potentially violating international water treaties . Here , the international boundary is an imaginary line through the middle of the river .\nEngineers and hydrologists told \u2588\u2588\u2588 and The Texas Tribune the wall should not have been built so close to the Rio Grande . ( Ver\u00f3nica G. C\u00e1rdenas for The Texas Tribune/\u2588\u2588\u2588 )\nThe commission had dealt with Fisher in New Mexico , where it also raised concerns after his team built on federal property without permission . In turn , Kolfage , a decorated Iraq War veteran , responded with a social media campaign implying the IBWC and its commissioner , Jayne Harkins , a Trump appointee , were letting unauthorized immigrants into the country and undermining the president .\nThat pattern repeated in Texas . Kolfage took aim at the National Butterfly Center as well as Rev . Roy Snipes , the parish priest at La Lomita church , an iconic sanctuary built along the Rio Grande in 1899 . Both are critics of the private wall effort and previously convinced lawmakers to exempt their properties from future government wall-building plans .\nKolfage tweeted that they were \u201c promoting trafficking of children , \u201d and that the butterfly center was home to a \u201c rampant sex trade . \u201d\nThe center \u2019 s executive director Marianna Trevi\u00f1o-Wright also received death threats . One irate Facebook user told her , \u201c You need to all be in jail or hanged . \u201d\nIt was \u201c shocking \u201d to be on the receiving end of such hate , said Trevi\u00f1o-Wright , who worries about the financial impact on the 100-acre wildlife center , which educates the public about biodiversity and relies on grants and donations .\nIn court , the IBWC complained to U.S. District Judge Randy Crane that instead of submitting the required comprehensive hydraulic models , Fisher and his team had turned in a six-page document with basic drawings that lacked necessary details .\nDespite repeated requests for the additional information and assurances that construction would stop until the U.S. section of the IBWC could analyze the model and confer with its Mexican counterparts , Fisher Industries continued to dig trenches , remove vegetation and grade the banks , court testimony shows .\nFisher insisted that he was acting in good faith and that he had met with IBWC officials , including Harkins , before the project to show them what his builders planned to do . The agency , he testified , didn \u2019 t raise any red flags with the project and told him its jurisdiction was limited on private property .\nCrane ruled in Fisher \u2019 s favor in January , saying that even though the engineering studies hadn \u2019 t been completed , government attorneys had failed to show that the project would violate the treaty with Mexico . He allowed Fisher to proceed with construction , but the lawsuit continued as the IBWC ran the hydraulic models . Two months later , with the nation \u2019 s attention fixated on the COVID-19 outbreak , Kolfage hailed the fence \u2019 s completion with a highly produced video .\nIn March , the IBWC \u2019 s model determined the fence violated the treaty by deflecting too much water at one point along its length . But overall , it found the wall \u2019 s impacts to be minor and recommended small design changes , such as installing a gate .\nLawrence Dunbar , an environmental and civil engineer who reviewed the report on behalf of \u2588\u2588\u2588 and The Texas Tribune , said the model was off , in part because it used flawed bollard width measurements that would show less blockage . The IBWC also needed to start the model farther upstream from the fence for it to work properly , he said .\n\u201c I would have expected that the fence would increase the water level ( during a flooding event ) , the only question was by how much , \u201d said Dunbar , who has 30 years of experience in flood and drainage matters and is a former lead hydrologist for the Army Corps of Engineers in the development of various floodplains for FEMA .\n\u201c You are putting in an obstruction , a barrier , in the middle of the floodplain of a major river that has a levee back away from it , \u201d said Dunbar , who has served as an expert witness on a number of state and federal lawsuits , including before the U.S. Supreme Court . \u201c It \u2019 s important they get it right , and they clearly did not get it right . \u201d\nSally Spener , a spokeswoman for the IBWC , said the commission couldn \u2019 t comment on specifics of the model because of the pending lawsuit against Fisher , but she said the commission \u2019 s engineers have \u201c top-notch qualifications and experience . \u201d\nCritics say the commission \u2019 s decision reflects relaxed oversight at the agency , which in recent years has allowed more construction-friendly hydrology models in part because of political pressure .\n\u201c They still know the U.S. can not guarantee that the fence will not adversely affect Mexico and will not affect the boundary in a flood , \u201d said Stephen Mumm , a political science professor at Colorado State University , who has spent decades studying U.S.-Mexico water diplomacy .\nBut , he added , each section has to represent its respective governments and be responsive to their presidents .\nFor the first time in February , IBWC Commissioner Harkins donated a total of $ 500 to the Trump campaign and a Republican political action committee , even as her agency was suing Fisher for failing to prove its fence would not violate the treaty she oversees . None of her three predecessors made similar contributions during their tenure , according to federal campaign contribution records . Through a spokeswoman , Harkins said , she \u201c simply responded to a routine solicitation for a political contribution . \u201d\nWhile Mexico has opposed border wall projects , it has done so quietly . Officials refused to comment for this story , referring all questions to the U.S. section of the commission . Spener said their Mexican counterparts are still reviewing the updated hydraulic model .\nBut they are concerned about potential obstruction that could raise water elevation as a result , she said , and that the fence could be knocked down during a flood , causing downstream impacts .\nThere \u2019 s a reason neither the government nor the private sector has built large structures so close to the river . Given the dynamics of the water , the type of terrain and the distance , it wasn \u2019 t a matter of whether there would be issues , experts said , it was a matter of how soon .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 and The Texas Tribune consulted six hydrologists and engineers , with expertise in wall construction , building near waterways or familiarity with the Rio Grande . They analyzed a combination of the six-page analysis from Fisher Industries ; a 24-page hydraulic analysis by the IBWC from March ; a series of photos of the fence and project details taken from court testimony .\nUnlike the bollard fences that the government builds 6 to 7 feet into the ground , Fisher \u2019 s wall has roughly a 2 1/2-foot foundation that stretches 8 feet wide . During court testimony , Greg Gentsch , the project \u2019 s engineer , downplayed the impact of wind on the fence \u2019 s shallow foundation and said he was confident that the footing design was appropriate for the area .\n\u201c To me , that was the biggest mistake they made , \u201d said Joseph Jarvis , an engineer who worked on border wall segments 12 years ago . \u201c While they focused on the velocity of the water that would go through the bollards , the bigger problem is the water that runs parallel ( to the fence ) , that \u2019 s the one that \u2019 s going to erode the dirt that \u2019 s supporting the foundation . \u201d\nGashes and gullies at the fence \u2019 s foundation show potentially dangerous erosion . ( Ver\u00f3nica G. C\u00e1rdenas for The Texas Tribune/\u2588\u2588\u2588 )\nAmy Patrick , a Houston forensic structural and civil engineer and court-recognized expert on wall construction , said she worries about its stability long-term . \u201c They are relying on a very shallow foundation to prevent overturning and then not taking care to ensure the bank on the Rio Grande side of the fence does not erode , \u201d said Patrick , who has questioned the engineering viability of border walls generally along the southern border .\nFisher \u2019 s team stripped the bank of its vegetation . They said it had been reseeded but the photographs still show bald spots . Native vegetation is key , said Adriana E. Martinez , a Southern Illinois University Edwardsville professor and geomorphologist who has studied the impact of the barriers on her hometown of Eagle Pass , Texas . It helps slow erosion and minimize the amount of sediment going into the river , which can affect water quality . The Rio Grande supplies drinking water for more than 6 million people .\nSolutions to the fence \u2019 s erosion range from filling the areas that are eroded and thoroughly revegetating with native species to installing piers beneath the foundation , some more costly than others . It will also require constant monitoring and maintenance , the experts said , as debris can clog the fence during heavy storms potentially worsening flooding .\nSpener , who confirmed the erosion , said the IBWC has advised Fisher that the company needs to monitor the slope and repair any issues \u201c in a timely manner . \u201d\nBut it \u2019 s unclear what Fisher \u2019 s maintenance plan is . Neither the IBWC nor Javier Pe\u00f1a , the attorney representing the National Butterfly Center , has received a copy from Fisher since they requested it in April .\nCourtois , the company attorney , did not comment on the maintenance issue , but he said the fence and roadway have performed as intended and are structurally sound . He said Fisher had personally inspected the site last week and attributed the erosion to light surface sand and the parts where \u201c vegetation has not yet fully taken hold . \u201d\nSpener said the commission \u2019 s enforcement authority in terms of ordering fixes or changes to a completed structure would be decided in the ongoing lawsuit .\nU.S. Rep. Joaqu\u00edn Castro , D-Texas , called the privately funded wall an illegal vanity project that jeopardizes the property and safety of Texas landowners . He urged the IBWC and courts to take the erosion seriously .\n\u201c It \u2019 s clear that no degree of \u2018 adjustments \u2019 to the wall will work , \u201d said Castro , vice chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee . \u201c This unnecessary \u2018 wall \u2019 must be taken down . \u201d\nThe New Mexico and South Texas projects are likely only the beginning for Fisher and We Build the Wall . They \u2019 ve both touted agreements with landowners in Texas for hundreds of miles of riverfront property , where the entities could conceivably build more walls like the one in Mission . Kolfage declined to specify locations .\nThey \u2019 ve said they hope to sell or donate the walls to the U.S. government . So far U.S. Customs and Border Protection has not agreed to take control of the Mission fence , but it has said it is not concerned about the private wall interfering with its own efforts in the region , which include building a parallel wall on about 13 miles of newly refurbished levee \u2014 about a mile above the Fisher structure \u2014 as part of a larger $ 300 million project .\nAnd following construction of the Mission fence , the Department of Homeland Security in May announced it was open to allowing private firms to pitch border fence projects . Kolfage called the change a direct result of the private wall projects , which \u201c prov ( ed ) the power of private enterprise . \u201d\nOut of 30 possible locations identified by the government for potential private wall projects , 23 are in Texas .\nAnother federal court hearing is scheduled for next week , where Pe\u00f1a , the attorney for butterfly center , said he will urge the judge to order an immediate inspection .\nAlso unresolved is the IBCW \u2019 s push for a fix to the deflection problem , where the fence can obstruct the path of the river during a flood event , in violation of the international treaty . Spener said they \u2019 ve asked Fisher for a plan detailing how they propose to address the issue .\nAt least for now , Fisher has packed his equipment and moved out west again , where he is erecting a 30-foot fence along the southern Arizona border for the federal government .\n\u201c They built the wall and left , \u201d Pe\u00f1a said . \u201c They got their donations , their government contract and they left us . \u201d",

If I was the sector chief and built something like that, I\u2019d be in so much trouble.\u201d\n\nBuilding Challenges\n\nThe private fence lies in the distance about a mile south from the site of a proposed government fence, forced inland because of flooding concerns. (Ver\u00f3nica G. C\u00e1rdenas for The Texas Tribune/ProPublica)\n\nLocated on the southernmost tip of Texas, the Rio Grande Valley\u2019s unique terrain has challenged wall builders for nearly two decades. The topography of the Valley includes a wide floodplain that has forced the government to construct barriers inland, on top of a levee system. That has left swaths of farmland, cemeteries and even homes in a kind of no man\u2019s land south of the fence, which has been built in fits and starts.\n\nThough tamed by a series of irrigation and flood control dams, the Rio Grande floods periodically, and sometimes catastrophically. In 2010, Hurricane Alex caused widespread damage along the banks of the river, including at the National Butterfly Center, just upriver from Fisher\u2019s fence.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t appreciate the power of the Rio Grande when it does indeed wake up,\u201d said Jude Benavides, who specializes in floodplain mapping in the Lower Rio Grande Valley at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. \u201cIt changes the landscape.\u201d\n\nFisher has said his wall \u2014 about a mile south of where the government is already building its version \u2014 will finally bring \u201cborder security to the border\u201d through a design that erases the flooding and erosion concerns that had scuttled earlier plans and vastly speeds up construction time.\n\nIt would be the first wall system that wouldn\u2019t cause flooding or deflect water, We Build the Wall founder Brian Kolfage claimed in a tweet. \u201cThe best engineers in the world designed this for floods, not government employees.\u201d\n\nFisher\u2019s system uses excavators to hang bollard sections, and without having to obtain myriad permits and approvals, he built it in just a matter of weeks, in stark contrast to government projects that take months or years to complete.\n\nWhen the government builds border fencing, it must meet a long list of requirements, including public meetings and stewardship plans, though critics say the process is fairly toothless since the Department of Homeland Security has waived many environmental requirements.\n\nFisher doesn\u2019t have to meet even those scaled down requirements.\n\nGovernment builders have also been slowed by eminent domain battles with landowners reluctant to sell. Fisher said his riverside building plan is more attractive to those hoping to avoid a fence bisecting their land and leaving acres behind a fence.\n\nHow Fisher Started Building\n\nFisher\u2019s strategy was years in the making. Soon after the 2016 election, he became a frequent guest on Fox News, where he caught the attention of Trump. Last year, The Washington Post reported that the president \u201clatch(ed) on\u201d to Fisher\u2019s claims of speed and quality and \u201caggressively pushed\u201d for the firm in conversations with top Homeland Security officials.\n\nBut Fisher\u2019s border wall business got off to a rocky start, despite paying a lobbying firm tens of thousands of dollars to push for contracts. In 2017, the firm, founded in 1952 and best known for large highway projects, had its wall prototype rejected by the Department of Homeland Security. It later attempted to join an elite group of preapproved border wall bidders, but it was again turned down by the Army Corps of Engineers, which said it failed to meet its requirements or obtain the necessary regulatory approvals.\n\nIn response, Fisher sued the department and was added to the list of preapproved bidders thanks to White House pressure, administration officials told the Post last year.\n\nFisher was also aided by a close relationship with freshman U.S. Sen.

Cramer\u2019s spokesperson did not return emails for comment.\n\nFisher\u2019s ambition was matched by his brashness, another quality that observers say drew him to the president. Last year, he compared traditional government wall building to a horse and carriage. \u201cBut I have a Lamborghini, and there\u2019s gonna be this concrete road, and we can do two hundred miles an hour, not ten,\u201d he told Texas Monthly.\n\nAs Cramer lobbied for the company, which included bringing Fisher to Trump\u2019s 2018 State of the Union address, Fisher embarked on two private ventures alongside We Build the Wall, whose board members include immigration hardliners such as former Colorado congressman Tom Tancredo, former Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke and former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach.\n\nThe first was in a mountainous area of Sunland Park, New Mexico, just outside of El Paso, where a half-mile wall of fencing appeared seemingly overnight to the surprise of local residents around Memorial Day 2019.\n\nSunland Park officials temporarily halted the group\u2019s fence project because it lacked proper building permits, prompting We Build The Wall to launch a campaign to flood town personnel with pushback.\n\n\u201cSo Sunland Park officials support open borders, the sex slaves and illegal drugs coming into their communities?\u201d Kolfage responded on Twitter, and he directed followers to \u201cburn up the phone lines.\u201d\n\nSunland Park Mayor Javier Perea said he received several death threats and thousands of messages, some telling him to watch his back and that opposition to the wall is equivalent to treason. \u201cI will support legislation to that effect,\u201d one email read. \u201cI would attend the hangings.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they had followed the rules from the very beginning, this wouldn\u2019t have been so much chaos and controversy,\u201d he told ProPublica and The Texas Tribune. \u201cBut that was not their intention, their intention was to bring attention to the issues and fundraising.\u201d The city ultimately issued the permits and the wall is still standing.\n\nSix months later, Fisher moved 800 miles east, and as his companies did in Sunland Park, he began building, this time along the sandy banks of the Rio Grande.\n\nA Lawsuit Slows Building\n\nThe $42 million project, which included a $1.5 million contribution from We Build the Wall, sputtered at the start. As Fisher began clearing a path for the wall, his company was sued by the federal government and a neighboring wildlife refuge in December.\n\nThe National Butterfly Center and the International Boundary and Water Commission brought Fisher Sand & Gravel Co. and its subsidiaries to court to stop it from building the fence until it submitted a detailed engineering study to determine the fence\u2019s impact on the flow of the Rio Grande and nearby properties.\n\nThe IBWC is a binational body that regulates building in the floodplain between the U.S. and Mexico because structures can worsen flooding and alter the course of the river, potentially violating international water treaties. Here, the international boundary is an imaginary line through the middle of the river.\n\nEngineers and hydrologists told ProPublica and The Texas Tribune the wall should not have been built so close to the Rio Grande. (Ver\u00f3nica G. C\u00e1rdenas for The Texas Tribune/ProPublica)\n\nThe commission had dealt with Fisher in New Mexico, where it also raised concerns after his team built on federal property without permission. In turn, Kolfage, a decorated Iraq War veteran, responded with a social media campaign implying the IBWC and its commissioner, Jayne Harkins, a Trump appointee, were letting unauthorized immigrants into the country and undermining the president.\n\nThat pattern repeated in Texas. Kolfage took aim at the National Butterfly Center as well as Rev. Roy Snipes, the parish priest at La Lomita church, an iconic sanctuary built along the Rio Grande in 1899. Both are critics of the private wall effort and previously convinced lawmakers to exempt their properties from future government wall-building plans.\n\nKolfage tweeted that they were \u201cpromoting trafficking of children,\u201d and that the butterfly center was home to a \u201crampant sex trade.\u201d\n\nThe center\u2019s executive director Marianna Trevi\u00f1o-Wright also received death threats. One irate Facebook user told her, \u201cYou need to all be in jail or hanged.\u201d\n\nIt was \u201cshocking\u201d to be on the receiving end of such hate, said Trevi\u00f1o-Wright, who worries about the financial impact on the 100-acre wildlife center, which educates the public about biodiversity and relies on grants and donations.\n\nIn court, the IBWC complained to U.S. District Judge Randy Crane that instead of submitting the required comprehensive hydraulic models, Fisher and his team had turned in a six-page document with basic drawings that lacked necessary details.\n\nDespite repeated requests for the additional information and assurances that construction would stop until the U.S. section of the IBWC could analyze the model and confer with its Mexican counterparts, Fisher Industries continued to dig trenches, remove vegetation and grade the banks, court testimony shows.\n\nFisher insisted that he was acting in good faith and that he had met with IBWC officials, including Harkins, before the project to show them what his builders planned to do. The agency, he testified, didn\u2019t raise any red flags with the project and told him its jurisdiction was limited on private property.\n\nCrane ruled in Fisher\u2019s favor in January, saying that even though the engineering studies hadn\u2019t been completed, government attorneys had failed to show that the project would violate the treaty with Mexico. He allowed Fisher to proceed with construction, but the lawsuit continued as the IBWC ran the hydraulic models. Two months later, with the nation\u2019s attention fixated on the COVID-19 outbreak, Kolfage hailed the fence\u2019s completion with a highly produced video.\n\nIn March, the IBWC\u2019s model determined the fence violated the treaty by deflecting too much water at one point along its length. But overall, it found the wall\u2019s impacts to be minor and recommended small design changes, such as installing a gate.\n\nLawrence Dunbar, an environmental and civil engineer who reviewed the report on behalf of ProPublica and The Texas Tribune, said the model was off, in part because it used flawed bollard width measurements that would show less blockage. The IBWC also needed to start the model farther upstream from the fence for it to work properly, he said.\n\n\u201cI would have expected that the fence would increase the water level (during a flooding event), the only question was by how much,\u201d said Dunbar, who has 30 years of experience in flood and drainage matters and is a former lead hydrologist for the Army Corps of Engineers in the development of various floodplains for FEMA.\n\n\u201cYou are putting in an obstruction, a barrier, in the middle of the floodplain of a major river that has a levee back away from it,\u201d said Dunbar, who has served as an expert witness on a number of state and federal lawsuits, including before the U.S. Supreme Court. \u201cIt\u2019s important they get it right, and they clearly did not get it right.\u201d\n\nSally Spener, a spokeswoman for the IBWC, said the commission couldn\u2019t comment on specifics of the model because of the pending lawsuit against Fisher, but she said the commission\u2019s engineers have \u201ctop-notch qualifications and experience.\u201d\n\nCritics say the commission\u2019s decision reflects relaxed oversight at the agency, which in recent years has allowed more construction-friendly hydrology models in part because of political pressure.\n\n\u201cThey still know the U.S. cannot guarantee that the fence will not adversely affect Mexico and will not affect the boundary in a flood,\u201d said Stephen Mumm, a political science professor at Colorado State University, who has spent decades studying U.S.-Mexico water diplomacy.\n\nBut, he added, each section has to represent its respective governments and be responsive to their presidents.\n\nFor the first time in February, IBWC Commissioner Harkins donated a total of $500 to the Trump campaign and a Republican political action committee, even as her agency was suing Fisher for failing to prove its fence would not violate the treaty she oversees. None of her three predecessors made similar contributions during their tenure, according to federal campaign contribution records. Through a spokeswoman, Harkins said, she \u201csimply responded to a routine solicitation for a political contribution.\u201d\n\nWhile Mexico has opposed border wall projects, it has done so quietly. Officials refused to comment for this story, referring all questions to the U.S. section of the commission. Spener said their Mexican counterparts are still reviewing the updated hydraulic model.\n\nBut they are concerned about potential obstruction that could raise water elevation as a result, she said, and that the fence could be knocked down during a flood, causing downstream impacts.\n\nWhy Border Walls Aren\u2019t Built by the River\n\nThere\u2019s a reason neither the government nor the private sector has built large structures so close to the river. Given the dynamics of the water, the type of terrain and the distance, it wasn\u2019t a matter of whether there would be issues, experts said, it was a matter of how soon.\n\nProPublica and The Texas Tribune consulted six hydrologists and engineers, with expertise in wall construction, building near waterways or familiarity with the Rio Grande. They analyzed a combination of the six-page analysis from Fisher Industries; a 24-page hydraulic analysis by the IBWC from March; a series of photos of the fence and project details taken from court testimony.\n\nUnlike the bollard fences that the government builds 6 to 7 feet into the ground, Fisher\u2019s wall has roughly a 2 1/2-foot foundation that stretches 8 feet wide. During court testimony, Greg Gentsch, the project\u2019s engineer, downplayed the impact of wind on the fence\u2019s shallow foundation and said he was confident that the footing design was appropriate for the area.\n\n\u201cTo me, that was the biggest mistake they made,\u201d said Joseph Jarvis, an engineer who worked on border wall segments 12 years ago. \u201cWhile they focused on the velocity of the water that would go through the bollards, the bigger problem is the water that runs parallel (to the fence), that\u2019s the one that\u2019s going to erode the dirt that\u2019s supporting the foundation.\u201d\n\nGashes and gullies at the fence\u2019s foundation show potentially dangerous erosion. (Ver\u00f3nica G. C\u00e1rdenas for The Texas Tribune/ProPublica)\n\nAmy Patrick, a Houston forensic structural and civil engineer and court-recognized expert on wall construction, said she worries about its stability long-term. \u201cThey are relying on a very shallow foundation to prevent overturning and then not taking care to ensure the bank on the Rio Grande side of the fence does not erode,\u201d said Patrick, who has questioned the engineering viability of border walls generally along the southern border.\n\nFisher\u2019s team stripped the bank of its vegetation. They said it had been reseeded but the photographs still show bald spots. Native vegetation is key, said Adriana E. Martinez, a Southern Illinois University Edwardsville professor and geomorphologist who has studied the impact of the barriers on her hometown of Eagle Pass, Texas. It helps slow erosion and minimize the amount of sediment going into the river, which can affect water quality. The Rio Grande supplies drinking water for more than 6 million people.\n\nSolutions to the fence\u2019s erosion range from filling the areas that are eroded and thoroughly revegetating with native species to installing piers beneath the foundation, some more costly than others. It will also require constant monitoring and maintenance, the experts said, as debris can clog the fence during heavy storms potentially worsening flooding.\n\nSpener, who confirmed the erosion, said the IBWC has advised Fisher that the company needs to monitor the slope and repair any issues \u201cin a timely manner.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s unclear what Fisher\u2019s maintenance plan is. Neither the IBWC nor Javier Pe\u00f1a, the attorney representing the National Butterfly Center, has received a copy from Fisher since they requested it in April.\n\nCourtois, the company attorney, did not comment on the maintenance issue, but he said the fence and roadway have performed as intended and are structurally sound. He said Fisher had personally inspected the site last week and attributed the erosion to light surface sand and the parts where \u201cvegetation has not yet fully taken hold.\u201d\n\nSpener said the commission\u2019s enforcement authority in terms of ordering fixes or changes to a completed structure would be decided in the ongoing lawsuit.\n\nU.S. Rep. Joaqu\u00edn Castro, D-Texas, called the privately funded wall an illegal vanity project that jeopardizes the property and safety of Texas landowners. He urged the IBWC and courts to take the erosion seriously.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that no degree of \u2018adjustments\u2019 to the wall will work,\u201d said Castro, vice chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \u201cThis unnecessary \u2018wall\u2019 must be taken down.\u201d\n\nMore Border Wall to Build\n\nThe New Mexico and South Texas projects are likely only the beginning for Fisher and We Build the Wall. They\u2019ve both touted agreements with landowners in Texas for hundreds of miles of riverfront property, where the entities could conceivably build more walls like the one in Mission. Kolfage declined to specify locations.\n\nThey\u2019ve said they hope to sell or donate the walls to the U.S. government. So far U.S. Customs and Border Protection has not agreed to take control of the Mission fence, but it has said it is not concerned about the private wall interfering with its own efforts in the region, which include building a parallel wall on about 13 miles of newly refurbished levee \u2014 about a mile above the Fisher structure \u2014 as part of a larger $300 million project.\n\nAnd following construction of the Mission fence, the Department of Homeland Security in May announced it was open to allowing private firms to pitch border fence projects. Kolfage called the change a direct result of the private wall projects, which \u201cprov(ed) the power of private enterprise.\u201d\n\nOut of 30 possible locations identified by the government for potential private wall projects, 23 are in Texas.\n\nAnother federal court hearing is scheduled for next week, where Pe\u00f1a, the attorney for butterfly center, said he will urge the judge to order an immediate inspection.\n\nAlso unresolved is the IBCW\u2019s push for a fix to the deflection problem, where the fence can obstruct the path of the river during a flood event, in violation of the international treaty. Spener said they\u2019ve asked Fisher for a plan detailing how they propose to address the issue.\n\nAt least for now, Fisher has packed his equipment and moved out west again, where he is erecting a 30-foot fence along the southern Arizona border for the federal government.\n\n\u201cThey built the wall and left,\u201d Pe\u00f1a said. \u201cThey got their donations, their government contract and they left us.\u201d\n\nLexi Churchill contributed reporting.",
