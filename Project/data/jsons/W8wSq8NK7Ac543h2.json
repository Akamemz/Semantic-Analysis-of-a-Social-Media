''\nYet in 2015 , despite a blessed lack of throttling of specific traffic streams , blocking of websites , and other feared behavior by internet service providers ( ISPs ) and mobile carriers , the FCC issued net neutrality rules that gave the federal government the right to punish business practices under Title II regulations designed for the old state-enabled Bell telephone monopoly .\nNow that Pai , who became chairman earlier this year , has announced an FCC vote to repeal the Obama-era regulations , he is being pilloried by progressives , liberals , Democrats , and web giants ranging from Google to Netflix to Amazon to Facebook , often in the name of protecting an `` open internet '' that would let little companies and startups flourish like in the good old days before Google , Netflix , Amazon , and Facebook dominated everything . Even the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) , which back in 2009 called FCC attempts to claim jurisdiction over the internet a `` Trojan Horse '' for government control , is squarely against the repeal .\nPai is also being targeted by net neutrality activists , who have posted signs naming his children by his house and reportedly ordered pizzas as a nuisance :\nI have a friend that lives near @ AjitPaiFCC .
