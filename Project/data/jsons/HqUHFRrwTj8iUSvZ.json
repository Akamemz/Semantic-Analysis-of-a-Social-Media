    "content": "Pardon me if I don \u2019 t join in the chorus of praise for Special Counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s investigatory efforts . Certainly , it comes as a relief that he correctly found no evidence of collusion between the Russian government and Donald Trump \u2019 s presidential campaign and quite properly did not charge the president for obstruction of justice . But just because Mueller and his team of Hillary Clinton sycophants reached the right conclusions does not mean that they conducted a righteous investigation . In that regard , given that the Special Counsel \u2019 s Office did not charge the persons who fabricated and used the Russia collusion fable to undermine Trump \u2019 s campaign and presidency , it would appear that , far from being impartial seekers of truth following the trail of evidence regardless of the political consequences , they were a get-Trump lynch party that simply ran out of rope .\nIn his order appointing the Special Counsel , Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein directed Mueller to \u201c conduct the investigation confirmed by then-FBI Director James B.
