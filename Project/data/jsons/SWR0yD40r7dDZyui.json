    "content": "Several senior House Democrats announced their support Tuesday for starting an impeachment inquiry against President Trump , putting party leaders on the defensive as they try to balance their hopes for an aggressive legislative agenda against a left wing out for blood .\nEven some of the leadership team of Speaker Nancy Pelosi , California Democrat , joined the push to start the path to impeachment , though they were careful to say they will defer to Mrs. Pelosi \u2019 s wishes .\nTheir fury was stoked by Mr. Trump \u2019 s directive to former White House counsel Don McGahn to defy a subpoena demanding that he testify Tuesday to the House Judiciary Committee . The White House said Mr. McGahn , as a former close adviser to Mr. Trump , did not have to testify under the separation of powers doctrine that protects a president \u2019 s close team from being forced to testify .\nLawmakers said the president \u2019 s moves to thwart their investigations have left them with few choices other than to beg the courts to referee .\n\u201c I think there \u2019 s a growing understanding that the impeachment process is going to be inevitable . It \u2019 s just a question of when , not if , \u201d said Rep. John A. Yarmuth , Kentucky Democrat and chairman of the House Budget Committee . \u201c If it happens this summer , that \u2019 s fine . If it goes into the fall or next year , I think that \u2019 s probably too late . \u201d\nAmong the new voices for impeachment was Rep. David N. Cicilline , Rhode Island Democrat and chairman of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee , and Rep. Mark Pocan , Wisconsin Democrat and chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus .\n\u201c Regrettably , the president \u2019 s most recent actions and continued disrespect for the Constitution are forcing us down the road to impeachment , \u201d Mr. Pocan said in a statement .\nMrs. Pelosi and her top lieutenants , though , say the time is not ripe .\nMajority Whip James E. Clyburn , South Carolina Democrat , told MSNBC that a majority of the House Democratic Caucus would prefer not to pursue impeachment right now , and Rep. Hakeem S. Jeffries of New York , chairman of the House Democratic Caucus , discounted talk of impeachment as inevitable .\n\u201c I disagree with the notion that a growing number of the Democratic caucus wants to jump straight to impeachment , \u201d he said . \u201c What unifies us is a focus on kitchen table issues . \u201d\nThat is also Mrs. Pelosi \u2019 s pitch . The Senate , controlled by Republicans , won \u2019 t convict Mr. Trump , so pursuing impeachment would be a partisan distraction from Democrats \u2019 campaign issues in 2018 .\nMrs. Pelosi is reportedly meeting with lawmakers Wednesday morning to discuss House investigations .\nSome freshmen Democrats from competitive districts , such as Reps. Katie Hill of California , Jason Crow of Colorado and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan , are siding with Mrs. Pelosi and Mr. Jeffries , saying they back the ongoing investigations but must take action on their party \u2019 s agenda .\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York , a bellwether liberal , said such talk smacked of fear .\n\u201c Failure to impeach now is neglect of due process , \u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez tweeted .\nAlthough the outcome of special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s investigation is riling many Democrats , the renewed heat behind impeachment comes from Mr. Trump \u2019 s moves to claim privilege or immunity to defy subpoenas for his team .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s instruction to Mr. McGahn not to appear for testimony this week was the last straw for some .\n\u201c Had he shown up , things might have been different , \u201d said Rep. Pramila Jayapal , Washington Democrat and member of the House Judiciary Committee .\nIn explaining to House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler , New York Democrat , why the White House was directing Mr. McGahn not to comply with the subpoena , White House Counsel Pat Cipollone said everything Mr. McGahn did is protected from disclosure by the president \u2019 s privilege to obtain advice from his close advisers without worrying about interrogation by political adversaries in Congress .\n\u201c The Department of Justice \u2026 has advised me that Mr. McGahn is absolutely immune from compelled congressional testimony with respect to matters occurring during his service as a senior adviser to the president , \u201d Mr. Cipollone wrote to Mr. Nadler on Monday .\nBecause Mr. McGahn \u2019 s work for the White House is exempt , he can not be held in contempt of Congress for refusing to comply , said the Justice Department \u2019 s office of legal counsel .\nRep. Doug Collins of Georgia , the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee , said Democrats are \u201c trying desperately to make something out of nothing . \u201d\nRep. Justin Amash , a Michigan Republican , who over the weekend said Mr. Trump had engaged in \u201c impeachable conduct , \u201d is encouraging other Republicans to join him .\nThat was quickly shot down by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy , California Republican , who said Mr. Amash was \u201c out of step with America . \u201d\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s going to be a trendsetting move , \u201d said Sen.

Al Green , a Texas Democrat who has repeatedly pushed impeachment even before the drastic escalation in tensions between Congress and the White House , said he will force a vote on impeachment if no one else does .\n\u201c I think that the president is leaving us very little choice , \u201d said Rep.
