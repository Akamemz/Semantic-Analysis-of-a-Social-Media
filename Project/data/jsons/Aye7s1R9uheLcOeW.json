    "content_original": "With this week marking the 58th anniversary of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, much has rightly been made of the Republican National Committee tweeting a picture of Rosa Parks this weekend, with a caption that said: \u201ctoday we remember Rosa Parks\u2019 bold stand and her role in ending racism.\" (emphasis added)\n\nBut while many have justifiably focused on the claim that racism has \u201cended\u201d (which the RNC later \"clarified\"), another significant truth has gotten lost.
