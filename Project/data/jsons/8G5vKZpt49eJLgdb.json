Trump replied , `` People have asked me that question , and I guess the answer has to be yes , or I do n't think I would have done it . '' And looking forward to his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention , Trump said he 's not looking to make a grand entrance like he did on Monday , but it will be more about a `` good grouping of words that 's going to talk about our country and the problems that we have . `` `` We have deep problems , '' said Trump . `` We have really deep-seated problems so it 's not about the entrance . It 's about the words and it 's about getting the words done , and the only way we 're going to get that taken care of is we have to , in November , do very well . `` The speech , he said , will include talk about trade , law and order , and the nation 's borders , among `` many different things . `` `` Our country has a lot of problems , '' he told Stephanopoulos . `` I think I 'll be basically using the same message and giving the same message that I 've been talking about for a long time . `` The ABC host reminded Trump that there have not been a lot of his big applause lines , such as a call for a temporary ban on Muslim immigration or his insistence that a wall be built along the Mexican border , but Trump told him that those are still key goals . `` You 'll be hearing a lot of things tomorrow , '' Trump said in the pre-recorded interview.But while there are many people who have said they believe Trump will need to evolve as the general election nears , the nominee told Stephanopoulos that '' I am who I am . `` `` I 'm a very honest person , '' he said . `` I think that my message is a good message . It got me here . We had almost 14 million votes . That 's more votes than anybody in the history of the Republican Party .
