    "content": "A group of top congressional Republicans introduced a bill Tuesday that would require the Homeland Security Department to come up with a way to measure how secure the borders are \u2014 at a time when the Obama administration has been resisting those efforts .\nThe bill would require the administration to develop a strategy to secure the border within the first six months , give the federal government another two years to gain control of the border , and require it to submit to validation by an independent think tank .\nIt is being sponsored by House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael T. McCaul , border security subcommittee Chairman Candice S. Miller and Sen. John Cornyn , a Texas Republican who is a senior member of the upper chamber .\n\u201c Until Congress mandates the creation of a national strategy , the administration will continue to say the border is secure while America \u2019 s back door remains wide open , \u201d Mr. McCaul said .\nThough none of the sponsors is part of the informal House or Senate talks to strike an immigration deal , the bill appears to be written as if it could become the border security \u201c trigger \u201d in any deal . Under a trigger , the border security conditions would have to be met in order for illegal immigrants to be put on a pathway to citizenship \u2014 though they would still gain legal status and work permits even before the borders were secure .\nPart of the problem with the trigger idea is that nobody agrees on what a secure border is .\nHomeland Security Secretary Janet A.

They point to the simmering drug cartel war in northern Mexico as a sign of trouble .\nThe Homeland Security Department scrapped the old definition of border security , known as \u201c operational control , \u201d in 2010 , at a time when it was only meeting that standard along a fraction of the 2,000-mile-long border .\nThe department had promised a new definition by 2012 , but none has been released yet and top officials said there isn \u2019 t one coming in the near future .\nLast week , The Los Angeles Times reported that a new drone program tracked would-be illegal crossers and found that the Border Patrol was apprehending far fewer crossers than it had thought .\nIn January , Congress \u2019 chief auditors released a report finding that the Border Patrol believed it was apprehending a little more than 60 percent of those illegally crossing the border .
