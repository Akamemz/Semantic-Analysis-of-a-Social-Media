But also , I having wrote a book last year about the Constitution and understanding the fragility of our system of government and how so much of it actually hinges on having a functioning electoral system , I felt it was imperative to give people a one-stop shopping place to go to get all the basics about voting so that that knowledge can be in everyone 's walking around vocabulary and we can start working from foundational principles \u2014 and not so much divisive concepts that I think flood the airwaves and flood so much of our conversations in private and public life right now .\nWell , a question I get a lot is about illegal voting .

And the framers understood that . But if we do n't go to the polls to protect democracy itself , it could fail . And I believe that 's what 's on the ballot in November .
