Now Pompeo faces the challenge of flipping that storyline.\n\nThere are signals that he may be able to do that. Pompeo's stewardship of the CIA has reportedly convinced some State Department officials that he has the managerial skills needed to lead America's diplomatic mission.\n\nStill, others have continued to voice concerns that Pompeo could act as a type of \"yes man\" for Trump, who campaigned on an \"America first\" vision of U.S. foreign policy and has often appeared skeptical of more traditional means of diplomacy.\n\nIn his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee earlier this month, Pompeo acknowledged the desire of department officials to be \"empowered.\"\n\n\"In a recent series of department briefings with team members at State, they all, to a person, expressed a hope to be empowered in their roles, and to have a clear understanding of the president\u2019s mission,\" he said.\n\nAlso key to Pompeo's success at the State Department is whether he can help fill dozens of vacant positions.
