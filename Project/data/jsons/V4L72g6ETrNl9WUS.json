Yes , that carnage exposed the special vulnerability of L.G.B.T .

Americans , as past acts of terror have shown and as everyone today must recognize . All Americans are under attack , and not exclusively because of whom we drink , dance or sleep with , but because of our bedrock belief that we should not be subservient to any one ideology or any one religion . That offends and inflames the zealots of the world .\nOften our politicians can \u2019 t find their voices . Sometimes their words are poignantly right .\nPresident Obama , speaking about the victims on Sunday afternoon , said : \u201c The place where they were attacked is more than a nightclub . It is a place of solidarity and empowerment where people have come together to raise awareness , to speak their minds and to advocate for their civil rights . So this is a sobering reminder that attacks on any American , regardless of race , ethnicity , religion or sexual orientation , is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country . \u201d\nAnd this was Eric Garcetti , the Los Angeles mayor , at a news conference : \u201c Today we know that we are targeted as Americans , because this is a society where we love broadly and openly , because we have Jews and Christians and Muslims and atheists and Buddhists marching together , because we are white , black , brown , Asian , Native American .
