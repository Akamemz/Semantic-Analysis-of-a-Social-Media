    "content": "Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says there 's no `` hard evidence '' of Russian involvement in Syria 's chemical bomb attack , but charges Moscow 's been `` incompetent '' and `` out-maneuvered '' by Bashar al-Assad .\nIn an interview with ABC News ' `` This Week '' aired Sunday , Tillerson said in his visit to Russia this week , he 'll call upon Moscow `` to fulfill the obligation it made to the international community when it agreed to be the guarantor of the elimination of the chemical weapons . ''\n`` Why Russia has not been able to achieve that is unclear to me , '' he said . `` I do n't draw conclusions of complicity at all . But clearly , they 've been incompetent , and perhaps they 've just simply been out-maneuvered by the Syrians . ''\nAlso in the interview , Tillerson said there 's been `` no change '' to the U.S. military stance in Syria beyond the missile strike in retaliation for the Assad government 's use of chemical weapons on its citizens , yet the action carries a message for other countries acting outside international norms .\nThe U.S. still hopes to shepherd a `` political process that we believe the Syrian people will lawfully be able to decide the fate of Assad , '' Tillerson said in reference to Syria 's president .\nThis week 's airstrike `` was a message to Bashar al-Assad that your multiple violations of your agreements at the UN , your agreements under the chemical weapons charter back in 2013 , that those would not go without a response in the future , '' he said .\nIf President Donald Trump needs to do more in Syria `` he will do more , '' U.S . Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on CNN 's `` State of the Union . '' Haley said she does n't see a political solution in Syria with Assad remaining as president , but that other U.S. priorities were defeating Islamic State and to `` get the Iranian influence out . ''\nOn CBS News ' `` Face the Nation , '' Tillerson also said that the first priority for the U.S. remains defeating Islamic State .\n`` Once the ISIS threat has been reduced or eliminated , I think we can turn our attention directly to stabilizing the situation in Syria , '' he said , using an acronym for the jihadist group .\nTillerson conceded that removing Assad from power could `` ultimately '' require greater pressure , including military action , from the U.S. or an international coalition , but he said that is n't the preferred choice .\n`` We 've seen what that looks like , when you undertake a violent regime change in Libya , and the situation in Libya continues to be very chaotic , '' he said . `` We have to learn the lessons of the past and learn the lessons of what went wrong in Libya when you choose that pathway of regime change . ''\nIn the wide-ranging ABC interview , Tillerson also said the U.S. has `` no objective '' to change North Korea 's regime as Kim Jong Un continues to ramp up Pyongyang 's nuclear program , and that there 's no reason for the U.S. to lift sanctions placed on Russia following its annexation of Crimea in 2014 .\nEven so , Tillerson said , without naming North Korea , that `` if you violate international agreements , if you fail to live up to commitments , if you become a threat to others , at some point a response is likely to be undertaken . ''\nTillerson is heading to Lucca , Italy , for a two-day meeting of G7 foreign ministers that starts Monday , and he will continue from there to Moscow for meetings with Sergey Lavrov , his Russian counterpart , and other Russian officials .\nPresslimination of the chemical weapons and why Russia has not been able to achieve that is unclear to me , '' Tillerson added .\nMoscow has said it does n't believe Assad 's forces carried out the attack on Thursday that involved children and called for a `` thorough and impartial '' investigation .\nUntil Sunday , Tillerson , 65 , the former chief executive of oil giant Exxon Mobil , had n't done the talk-show circuit and had consented to few interviews since being sworn in as the top U.S. diplomat in February .\nOn North Korea 's nuclear capability , Tillerson said Kim Jong Un `` has made significant advancements in delivery systems , and that is what concerns us the most . ''\nThe U.S. has been `` quite clear with the regime in Pyongyang '' that it needs to cease all weapons testing `` before we can think about having further talks with them , '' he said .\nTillerson said he will continue to press Russia on its meddling in last year 's U.S. presidential election through hacking and leaking Democrats ' emails , which U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded was ultimately aimed at helping Trump win the White House .\n`` We will continue to talk with them about how this undermines any hope of improving relations , not just with the United States , but it 's -- it 's pretty evident that they are taking similar tactics into electoral processes throughout Europe and so they 're really undermining any hope for improved relations with many European countries as well , '' he said .",
