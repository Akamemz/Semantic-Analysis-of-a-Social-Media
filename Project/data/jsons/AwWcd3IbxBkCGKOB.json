Clinton \u2019 s advantage in the RealClearPolitics polling average was down to 3.3 points , less than half of what it was at its peak .\nFor all that , however , the Democratic nominee remains the favorite to win the White House \u2014 in part because of her strength in the battleground states that will decide the election .\nClinton has succeeded in making some Republican redoubts competitive , including Georgia and Arizona .

Another recent poll , from Emerson College , had the race tied . As of Tuesday afternoon , however , Clinton still held a 3.3-point lead in the RealClearPolitics average .\nThe demographics go some way toward explaining the tightness of the race . Only 3 percent of Ohio voters in 2012 were Latino , according to exit polls . The proportion of voters who were college graduates was just 40 percent , the lowest figure among the 11 battleground states highlighted here .\nThat should make Ohio fertile ground for Trump \u2019 s core appeal to blue-collar whites .\nStill , the Clinton campaign is leaning on traditional tactics to win the state . Her campaign had 36 field offices there to Trump \u2019 s 16 at the end of August , according to a recent \u201c PBS NewsHour \u201d analysis . On TV , Clinton and her allies are outspending their Republican counterparts by a huge amount .

Of the four most recent major polls of the state , Clinton and Trump each led two . No result showed an advantage of more than 2 percentage points for either candidate .\nFlorida is also one of the most expensive states in which to compete . Clinton and her allies have booked almost $ 34 million in ads there , according to Ad Age and Kantar Media .\nThe outlook is more optimistic for Trump than many observers expected , given that 17 percent of Florida voters in 2012 were Latino and the traditional loyalty of Cuban-Americans to the GOP has been weakening .\nBut could Trump \u2019 s skeletal campaign cost him ? He had only one field office in the state in late August , compared with 34 for Clinton , according to the PBS figures .\nOne of Clinton \u2019 s strongest states among the battlegrounds , Virginia is Exhibit A in how the electoral map is changing .\nThe commonwealth was a Republican stronghold until 2008 , when President Obama became the first Democrat to carry it since Lyndon Johnson in 1964 .

Another group largely uninterested in Trump \u2014 college graduates \u2014 cast 54 percent of the votes there in 2012 , the highest figure in any of these 11 states .\nIn another example of the changing nature of the South , Clinton seems to have a slight edge in North Carolina . The mere fact that she is competitive says a lot : Obama became the first Democrat in three decades to carry the state in 2008 , and he lost there in 2012 .\nRight now , Clinton has a very small lead in the RealClearPolitics average . But she has 30 field offices in the state , while Trump is not known to have any . She and her allies have booked $ 16 million in ads there , to just $ 1 million for Trump .\nJust as vitally for Clinton , African-Americans cast a bigger share of the total votes there in 2012 \u2014 23 percent \u2014 than in any other battleground .\nThe Trump campaign has long talked up its chances of prevailing in Pennsylvania , but so far , that looks unlikely . Clinton has a lead of more than 6 points in the RealClearPolitics average .\nRepublicans have consistently sought to flip Pennsylvania , but they have come up short in every election since 1988 .\nOf the total votes cast in 2012 , around 20 percent came from nonwhites .

Both those numbers are higher than the average , and Trump performs poorly with both groups .\nWinning Wisconsin would seem to be a big stretch for Trump : A Republican has not carried the state since President Ronald Reagan did in his 1984 reelection landslide .
