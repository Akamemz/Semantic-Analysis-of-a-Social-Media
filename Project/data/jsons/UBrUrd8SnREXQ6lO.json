    "content": "( CNN ) Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders both accused Donald Trump of inciting violence , with the former secretary of state calling him `` bigoted '' and alleging he had perpetrated `` political arson , '' while the Vermont senator labeled him a `` pathological liar '' at a town hall on Sunday night .\n`` It is clear that Donald Trump is running a very cynical campaign pitting groups of Americans against one another . He is trafficking in hate and fear , '' Clinton said during the event at Ohio State University hosted by CNN and TV One . `` He actually incites violence in the way he urges his audience on , talking about punching people , offering to pay legal bills . ''\nClinton charged that Trump was guilty of a case of `` political arson '' by throwing fuel on political divisions in the country .\n`` He has been incredibly bigoted towards so many groups , '' she continued . `` You do n't make America great by tearing down everything that made America great . ''\nClinton followed Sanders at the town hall moderated by CNN 's Jake Tapper and TV One 's Roland Martin . Sanders and Clinton are making closing arguments to voters in their increasingly contentious Democratic nominating marathon , two days before five states vote in crucial primaries that could set the tone for the rest of the contest .\nOn Sunday night , Clinton 's comments followed Sanders ' own sharp criticism of Trump .\n`` I hesitate to say this because I really do n't like to disparage public officials , but Donald Trump is a pathological liar , '' Sanders said .\nSanders also blasted Trump for saying that he might pay the legal fees of a man charged with punching a protester at one of his rallies , adding that doing so was tantamount to `` inciting violence . ''\n`` I would hope Mr. Trump tones it down big time and tells his supporters that violence is not acceptable in the American political process , '' Sanders said .\nJUST WATCHED Hillary Clinton opens up on death penalty stance Replay More Videos ...

Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995 during her husband 's administration .\nSpeaking directly to Jackson , however , she told him , `` I just ca n't even imagine what you went through and how terrible those days and nights must have been for all those years . All of us are so regretful that you or any person had to go through what you did . ''\nJackson , who is an undecided voter , was then asked by Martin if he was satisfied with Clinton 's response .
