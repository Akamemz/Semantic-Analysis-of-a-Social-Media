    "content": "We \u2019 ve probably all got somebody on our friends list who \u2019 s been sharing a lot of suspect information about the coronavirus . The component pseudo-facts of conspiracy theories are floating around Facebook in abundance , and it \u2019 s super frustrating to see them rebroadcast by people you know and love . You may be tempted to unfriend them or ignore their posts\u2014both valid options , should you choose to take them\u2014but when it comes to pushing back against misinformation , you have more power than you think .\nYes , even the ones posting nonsense on your Facebook wall . Chances are , you are somebody \u2019 s most trusted source : Amid t he rapid spread of the Plandemic video , many posted it while admitting they weren \u2019 t sure about the claims it made but found they seemed important , or sought to ask their more well-informed friends for their opinions . The implied message in posting anything to social media is that we want to hear what others think about it .\nWith that trust comes both power and responsibility . Think about how fans listen to celebrities , even when said celebrities have no authority relevant to the subject they \u2019 re speaking on . There are plenty of smaller scale examples of this phenomenon in every community , as we all have people we respect and whose opinions we give extra weight to . Maybe that \u2019 s your rabbi , your doctor , your mom , your yoga teacher , that coworker who always hears the best gossip first and is somehow always right about it . Sometimes you don \u2019 t ever know that you \u2019 re That Friend for somebody , but they \u2019 ve been listening closely to what you say all along .\nThese days , if you \u2019 re in a medical profession or if you \u2019 re particularly good at staying on top of the news , you \u2019 re pretty much guaranteed to be in somebody \u2019 s pantheon of trusted sources . People are listening to you , even if you don \u2019 t realize it .\nElla 's First Rabbit Is a Perfect Vibrator for Beginners ( and for ...

No matter how thoughtful your response , they \u2019 ll just dig in harder . After all , the hallmark of a conspiracy theory is that it persists no matter the evidence .\nBut when you have a conversation about misinformation , your audience isn \u2019 t just the person you \u2019 re speaking to . On Facebook , for example , hundreds of people might see the post without commenting and without you necessarily knowing it : your friends , their friends , members of a group that you both belong to .\nFor this reason , I prefer to keep conversations about misinformation public . If somebody DMs you and wants to know more , seriously consider how useful the conversation is going to be . If they \u2019 re mad and just want to fight , it \u2019 s not worth your time . If they are a person important to you , and you think you might be able to change their mind , it \u2019 s your call .\nAnother thing about those sometimes-invisible onlookers : M ost of them have probably not bought into the latest wacky theory ; t hey just don \u2019 t say much about it either way . To use a different example , anti-vaccine posts may outnumber posts that sing the praises of vaccines . That \u2019 s because most people get their kids vaccinated and don \u2019 t make a big deal about it . They don \u2019 t post about it any more than they \u2019 d post \u201c Hey look , I brushed my teeth today. \u201d So if you see a lot of misinformation out there , don \u2019 t get too discouraged .\nSome misinformation can be addressed on a factual basis . If somebody tells you that COVID-19 cases are falling in your state , you can show them the actual numbers . If they say the \u201c CDC says ... \u201d something false , you can point out on the CDC website where it actually says the opposite . When it \u2019 s a simple claim like this , facts work .\nBut most of the time , the person who brings up misinformation is more swayed by tone or implications than the actual facts . B efore you get too deep into the details , ask them a few open-ended questions and listen\u2014 really listen\u2014 to their answers :\nYou won \u2019 t necessarily ask them in those exact words , but ask . This is where you \u2019 ll learn that they \u2019 re actually concerned about something other than the particular news story they posted.\u2014t hey may actually have a serious worry about their family , their health or their job . And don \u2019 t be afraid to share your own history and concerns . If they learn how you came to your conclusions , it may help them change their own .\nYou keep the most credibility when you \u2019 re respectful and honest .\nIn t he most scarily effective propaganda , the \u201c talking head \u201d is calm and collected , speaking with a laid-back authority . Good propaganda artists speak softly and let everyone else get angry and frustrated . Take Plandemic for example .\nBut there \u2019 s another reason to stay calm : R emember , these people are your friends . ( And friends-of-friends , and whoever else is watching . ) People mostly just want to be understood and have their concerns heard .\nSo be nice to your friends . I f you \u2019 re going to drop a link debunking the thing they post about , consider the tone of the article you choose .
