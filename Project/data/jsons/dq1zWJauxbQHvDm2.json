    "title": "OPINION: Jobs Versus Net Jobs ",

    "content": "One of the reasons for the popularity of political rhetoric is that everybody can be right , in terms of their own rhetoric , no matter how much the rhetoric of one side contradicts the rhetoric of the other side .\nPresident Obama constantly repeats how many millions of jobs have been created during his administration , while his critics constantly repeat how many millions of jobs have been lost during his administration . How can both of them be right -- or , at least , how can they both get away with what they are saying ?\nThere are jobs and there are net jobs . This is true not only today but has been true in years past .\nBack during the 1980s , when there were huge losses of jobs in the steel industry , the government restricted the importation of foreign steel . It has been estimated that this saved 5,000 jobs in the American steel industry .\nBut of course restriction of competition from lower-priced imported steel made steel more expensive to American producers of products containing steel . Therefore the price of these products rose , making them less in demand at these higher prices , causing losses of sales at home and in the world market .\nThe bottom line is that , while 5,000 jobs were saved in the American steel industry , 26,000 jobs were lost in American industries that produced products made of steel . On net balance , the country lost jobs by restricting the importation of steel .\nNone of this was peculiar to the steel industry . Restrictions on the importation of sugar are estimated to have cost three times as many jobs in the confection industry as they saved in the sugar industry . The artificially high price of sugar in the United States led some American producers of confections to relocate to Mexico and Canada , where the price of sugar is lower .\nThere is no free lunch in the job market , any more than there is anywhere else . The government can always create particular jobs or save particular jobs , but that does not mean that it is a net creation of jobs or a net saving of jobs .\nThe government can create a million jobs tomorrow , just by hiring that many people . But where does the government get the money to pay those people ? From the private economy -- which loses the money that the government gains .\nWith less money in the private sector , the loss of jobs there can easily exceed the million jobs created in the government or in industries subsidized by the government . The Obama administration 's creation of `` green jobs '' has turned out to cost far more money per job than the cost of creating a job in the private sector .\nIn addition to reducing jobs in the private sector by taking money out of the private sector to pay for government-subsidized jobs , the Obama administration has made businesses reluctant to hire because of the huge uncertainties it has created for businesses as regards the cost of adding employees . With thousands of regulations still being written to implement ObamaCare , no one knows how much this will add to the cost of hiring new employees .\nIn the face of this economic uncertainty , even businesses that have an increased demand for their products can meet that demand by working their existing employees overtime , instead of adding new employees . Many employers hire temporary workers , who are not legally entitled to benefits such as health insurance , and who will therefore not be affected by the cost of ObamaCare .\nWhen President Obama boasts of the number of jobs created during his administration , the numbers he cites may be correct , but he does n't count the other jobs that were lost during his administration . His critics cite the latter . Both can claim to be right because they are talking about different things .\nWhat has been the net effect ? During this administration , the proportion of the working age population that has a job has fallen to the lowest level in decades . The official unemployment rate does not count the millions of people who have simply given up looking for a job .\nIf everybody gave up looking for a job , the official unemployment rate would fall to zero . But that would hardly mean that the problem was solved or that the `` stimulus '' worked . Creating particular jobs does not mean a net increase in jobs .",
