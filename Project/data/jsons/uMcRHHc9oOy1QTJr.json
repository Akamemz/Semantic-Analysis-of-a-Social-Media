The Washington Post \u2019 s exit polls indicated that black voters would make up 28 percent of the voters , greater than their 26 percent share of the population , which would be a dramatic turnaround from previous statewide special elections in the South , including a special election for the Sixth District in Georgia , which saw black support for Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff dissipate on Election Day .\nAs the Cook Political Report editor Dave Wasserman noted on Twitter , turnout was particularly high in the counties with the largest black populations . In Greene County , a small area that is 80 percent black and that Martin Luther King Jr. frequented in his Poor People \u2019 s Campaign , the turnout reached 78 percent of that of 2016 , an incredible mark given that special elections and midterms usually fall far short of general-election marks . Perry County , also an important mostly black site of voting-rights battles of old , turned out at 75 percent of 2016 levels . Dallas County , whose seat is the city of Selma , hit the 74 percent mark . And while the exact numbers aren \u2019 t in for all of the majority-black or heavily black counties , black voters appear to have favored Jones at rates close to or more than 90 percent .\nMeanwhile , Moore \u2019 s support sagged in mostly white counties . The race was probably over for the former state chief justice when Cullman County , which is virtually all white and heavily supported Trump in 2016 , turned out only at 56 percent of its 2016 level . It really does seem that although many white voters weren \u2019 t convinced to vote for Jones , the allegations against Moore persuaded many of them to stay home .\nThese results demolish the preestablished media narrative about black voters in the state and defy conventional wisdom . Black voters were informed and mobilized to go vote , and did so even in the face of significant barriers .\nI previously noted that Alabama is one of the hardest states in the country to vote\u2014especially so for black voters\u2014and that voter-suppression efforts could have had strong effects on black votes . Tuesday night \u2019 s returns are all the more remarkable because of the surge of turnout that appears to have taken place in spite of those very real barriers .\nThe grassroots organizing in black communities by groups such as local NAACP chapters was more muscular than it had even been in the 2016 general election . In the lead-up to Tuesday \u2019 s contest , voting-rights groups registered people with felonies , targeted awareness campaigns at people who might not have had proper identification , and focused specifically on knocking down the structures in place that keep black voters away from the polls . Their efforts immediately become a case study in a region that has , since the Supreme Court \u2019 s 2013 Shelby County v.
