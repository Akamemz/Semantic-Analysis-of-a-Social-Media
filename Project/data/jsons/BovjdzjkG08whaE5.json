The first cases of the new coronavirus may have emerged as early as November , and as cases exploded , the Trump administration in February chastised China for censoring information about the outbreak and keeping U.S. experts from entering the country to help .\n\u201c It was heartbreaking to watch , \u201d said Bao-Ping Zhu , a Chinese American who served in that role , which was funded by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , between 2007 and 2011 . \u201c If someone had been there , public health officials and governments across the world could have moved much faster . \u201d\nZhu and the other sources said the American expert , Dr. Linda Quick , was a trainer of Chinese field epidemiologists who were deployed to the epicenter of outbreaks to help track , investigate and contain diseases .\nAs an American CDC employee , they said , Quick was in an ideal position to be the eyes and ears on the ground for the United States and other countries on the coronavirus outbreak , and might have alerted them to the growing threat weeks earlier .\nNo other foreign disease experts were embedded to lead the program after Quick left in July , according to the sources . Zhu said an embedded expert can often get word of outbreaks early , after forming close relationships with Chinese counterparts .\nZhu and the other sources said Quick could have provided real-time information to U.S. and other officials around the world during the first weeks of the outbreak , when they said the Chinese government tamped down on the release of information and provided erroneous assessments .\nQuick left amid a bitter U.S. trade dispute with China when she learned her federally funded post , officially known as resident adviser to the U.S. Field Epidemiology Training Program in China , would be discontinued as of September , the sources said . The U.S. CDC said it first learned of a \u201c cluster of 27 cases of pneumonia \u201d of unexplained origin in Wuhan , China , on Dec. 31 .\nSince then , the outbreak of the disease known as COVID-19 has spread rapidly worldwide , killing more than 13,600 people , infecting more than 317,000 . The epidemic has overwhelmed healthcare systems in some countries , including Italy , and threatens to do so in the United States and elsewhere .\nDuring a press briefing on Sunday shortly after this story was first published , President Donald Trump dismissed the \u2588\u2588\u2588 report as similar to other stories regarding the CDC that he described as \u201c 100 percent wrong , \u201d without addressing whether the role had been eliminated .\nU.S. CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield maintained the agency \u2019 s presence in China \u201c is actually being augmented as we speak , \u201d without elaborating .\nIn a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588 before the report was published , the CDC said the elimination of the adviser position did not hinder Washington \u2019 s ability to get information and \u201c had absolutely nothing to do with CDC not learning of cases in China earlier . \u201d\nThe agency said its decision not to have a resident adviser \u201c started well before last summer and was due to China \u2019 s excellent technical capability and maturity of the program . \u201d\nThe CDC said it has assigned two of its Chinese employees as \u201c mentors \u201d to help with the training program . The agency did not respond to questions about the mentors \u2019 specific role or expertise .\nThe CDC would not make Quick , who still works for the agency , available for comment .\nAsked for comment on Chinese transparency and responsiveness to the outbreak , China \u2019 s Ministry of Foreign Affairs referred \u2588\u2588\u2588 to remarks by spokesman Geng Shuang on Friday . Geng said the country \u201c has adopted the strictest , most comprehensive , and most thorough prevention and control measures in an open , transparent , and responsible manner , and informed the ( World Health Organization ) and relevant countries and regions of the latest situation in a timely manner . \u201d\nOne disease expert told \u2588\u2588\u2588 he was skeptical that the U.S. resident adviser would have been able to get earlier or better information to the Trump administration , given the Chinese government \u2019 s suppression of information .\n\u201c In the end , based on circumstances in China , it probably wouldn \u2019 t have made a big difference , \u201d Scott McNabb , who was a CDC epidemiologist for 20 years and is now a research professor at Emory University . \u201c The problem was how the Chinese handled it . What should have changed was the Chinese should have acknowledged it earlier and didn \u2019 t . \u201d\nAlex Azar , secretary of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) said on Friday that his agency learned of the coronavirus in early January , based on Redfield \u2019 s conversations with \u201c Chinese colleagues . \u201d\nRedfield learned that \u201c this looks to be a novel coronavirus \u201d from Dr. Gao Fu , the head of the China CDC , according to an HHS administration official , who spoke on condition of anonymity . \u201c Dr . Redfield always talked to Dr. Gao , \u201d the official said .\nHHS and CDC did not make Azar or Redfield available for comment .\nZhu and other sources said U.S. leaders should not have been relying on the China CDC director for alerts and updates . In general , they said , officials in China downplayed the severity of the outbreak in the early weeks and did not acknowledge evidence of person-to-person transmission until Jan. 20 .\nAfter the epidemic exploded and China had imposed strict quarantines , Trump administration officials complained that the Chinese had censored information about the outbreak and that the United States had been unable to get American disease experts into the country to help contain the spread .\nAzar told CNN on Feb. 14 that he and CDC director Redfield officially offered to send a CDC team into China on Jan. 6 but still had not received permission for them to enter the country .
