    "content": "One of the oddest features of the 2016 presidential race is that the Republican nominee , Donald Trump , emerged on the political scene this decade by repeatedly questioning whether President Barack Obama was born in America \u2014 and yet it seems Trump \u2019 s embrace of this crackpot conspiracy theory has hardly been discussed during this campaign .\nYes , the GOP nominee was the highest-profile `` birther '' for much of 2011 , and continued to perpetuate the movement \u2019 s debunked nonsense for many years afterward , despite it being fringe racist nonsense .\nNow , though , the Washington Post \u2019 s Robert Costa has elevated the subject again . In an interview with Trump on Wednesday , Costa asked the candidate whether he now believed Obama was born in Hawaii , and Trump refused to answer . `` I \u2019 ll answer that question at the right time , '' Trump told Costa . `` I just don \u2019 t want to answer it yet . ''\nAnd when Costa followed up by pointing out that Trump \u2019 s top adviser , Kellyanne Conway , has said that Trump now believed Obama was born in the US , Trump was noncommittal . `` It \u2019 s okay . She \u2019 s allowed to speak what she thinks , '' Trump told Costa . `` I want to focus on jobs . I want to focus on other things . ''\nHours after Costa \u2019 s story was posted on Thursday , Trump adviser Jason Miller sent out a statement claiming that `` Mr. Trump believes that President Obama was born in the United States . '' Furthermore , Miller ludicrously tried to give Trump credit for bringing `` this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling President Obama to release his birth certificate , '' as if he were doing some sort of public service .\nFinally , on Friday , Trump himself begrudgingly gave an extremely brief statement that `` President Barack Obama was born in the United States , period , '' and again dishonestly blamed Clinton for supposedly starting the controversy . But he shouldn \u2019 t be allowed to worm out of this so easily , because birtherism is in many ways the urtext of Trump \u2019 s presidential campaign . It demonstrates his willingness to mainstream fringe racism , his desire to flout the norms of political discourse , his ability to play the media , and his imperviousness to facts . And Trump has never truly been held to account for it during this campaign .\nThe US Constitution requires that the president of the United States be a `` natural born citizen . '' Obama is one , by virtue of having been born in Hawaii ( to a US citizen mother ) . But birthers raised the question ... what if he wasn \u2019 t ?\nWhen Obama first ran for president in 2008 , he had a very different background from all previous presidential nominees . He wasn \u2019 t white , his middle name was Hussein , and he had lived abroad for several years as a child . And the fever swamps of the internet responded to this by letting their imaginations run wild . One fringe theory was that Obama was a `` secret Muslim . '' Another was that he was lying about having been born in Hawaii , and was in fact born in another country \u2014 likely Kenya \u2014 and was therefore ineligible for the presidency .\nThis chatter first emerged during the contentious 2008 Democratic primary , but was limited to chain emails and such rather than being associated with anyone prominent , according to Politico . It then continued during the general election and Obama \u2019 s presidency and was embraced by little-known fringe figures like Orly Taitz and Philip Berg , and the right-wing pundit Jerome Corsi .\nIt never made a lick of sense . In the summer of 2008 , the Obama campaign released his shortform birth certificate from the Hawaii Department of Health . Fact-checkers examined it and were satisfied that it was authentic . Furthermore , there were contemporaneous announcements of Obama \u2019 s birth printed in Hawaiian newspapers at the time . Then in 2011 , Obama finally dredged up his longform birth certificate . But since conspiracy theorists are conspiracy theorists , they invented all sorts of reasons to dismiss and disbelieve all this evidence .\nAs Trump publicly considered a presidential campaign against Obama in 2011 , he gained media attention and popularity on the right by becoming the highest-profile `` birther '' ever . Here \u2019 s the timeline :\nFebruary 10 , 2011 : Trump gives a speech to CPAC in which he says he \u2019 s thinking about running for president , and dips his toe into birtherism . `` Our current president came out of nowhere . Came out of nowhere , '' he told the crowd . `` In fact , I 'll go a step further : The people that went to school with him , they never saw him , they do n't know who he is . It 's crazy . ''\nMarch 23 , 2011 : Trump says on The View : `` I want him to show his birth certificate . I want him to show his birth certificate . ... There 's something on that birth certificate that he does n't like . ''\n: `` I want him to show his birth certificate . I want him to show his birth certificate . ... There 's something on that birth certificate that he does n't like . '' March 28 , 2011 : Asked on Fox & Friends whether he thinks Obama was born in this country , Trump responds , `` I am really concerned . '' He went on to speculate that the birth announcement for Obama in a Hawaii newspaper could have been planted `` for whatever reason . ''\nwhether he thinks Obama was born in this country , Trump responds , `` I am really concerned .

( More than five years later , Trump has still never released his tax returns . )\nApril 25 , 2011 : Trump tells Anderson Cooper , `` I 've been told very recently , Anderson , that the birth certificate is missing . I 've been told that it 's not there or it does n't exist . And if that 's the case , it 's a big problem . ''\nApril 27 , 2011 : President Obama releases his original longform birth certificate , attempting to at long last put the matter to rest . Trump responds by ... simply changing the subject to Obama \u2019 s college records . `` The word is , according to what I \u2019 ve read , that he was a terrible student when he went to Occidental . He then gets to Columbia ; he then gets to Harvard , '' Trump said . `` Maybe that \u2019 s right , or maybe it \u2019 s wrong . But I don \u2019 t know why he doesn \u2019 t release his records . ''\nOkay , but after Obama delivered his birth certificate , Trump moved on , right ?\nWho are you kidding ? It 's very hard to convince conspiracy theorists that they 're wrong with evidence , because they will just invent new reasons to disbelieve any piece of evidence they do n't like . Plus , this is Donald Trump we \u2019 re talking about .\nSo contrary to his campaign \u2019 s transparently false statement that Trump brought `` closure to the issue '' in 2011 , Trump continued to spread nonsense about it for years afterward and come up with new bogus reasons not to believe the document Obama released :\nLet 's take a closer look at that birth certificate . @ BarackObama was described in 2003 as being `` born in Kenya .
