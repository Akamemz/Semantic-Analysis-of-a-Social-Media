at the third and final 2016 presidential debate and are now left with just the final sprint to Election Day.\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe tilt in Las Vegas had a little something for everyone: sharp personal attacks, substantive policy discussion and Trump\u2019s unmatched ability to provoke controversy.Here are five takeaways from their final clash:Pundits had predicted Clinton would seek to play it safe in the last debate, with polls giving her a comfortable lead nationally and in battleground states.\n\nInstead, she sought to run up the score.\n\nShe attacked Trump aggressively, seeking a resounding victory that will rob her detractors of the argument that she lacks a mandate to govern.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m reaching out to all Americans, Democrats, Republicans and independents, because we need everyone to help make our country what it needs to be,\u201d Clinton said in her closing remarks.\n\nShortly before that, Clinton attacked Trump for having taken out an advertisement in the 1980s that was critical of Ronald Regan, the most revered figure in the modern conservative movement.\n\n\n\nShe adopted some of the populist rhetoric of Trump and her former primary rival, Bernie Sanders Bernie Sanders2020 Democrats push for gun control action at forum Sanders heart procedures shines spotlight on age of top Democrats Sanders uses health scare to promote 'Medicare for

aggressive for a candidate who needs only to run out the clock, describing Trump as a choke artist and calling him a \u201cpuppet\u201d of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\n\nGoing for the kill could help the down-ballot Democrats emboldened by the GOP\u2019s internal civil war over Trump, even as she seeks to expand the presidential electoral map.\n\n\n\nClinton\u2019s campaign has moved into traditionally red states, dispatching top surrogates to places like Arizona and seeking to capitalize on Trump\u2019s freefall in places including Georgia, Alaska and Utah.\n\n\n\nIn the spin room before the debate, Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon described Texas as a \u201cpurple\u201d state where the election would be closer than people think.\n\n\n\nWomen at the forefront\n\n\n\nModerator Chris Wallace of Fox News opened a section of the debate about the candidates' fitness for office by challenging Trump on the women who have accused him of groping or kissing them without permission.\n\n\n\nIt was perhaps the most intense stretch of the debate and culminated in one of Clinton\u2019s strongest moments.\n\nTrump claimed that the allegations from all of his accusers had been \u201cdebunked.\u201d He blamed the Clinton campaign for planting false stories about him and called his accusers publicity hounds.\n\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even apologize to my wife, who is sitting right here, because I didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Trump said.\n\n\n\nIn a somber tone delivered over repeated interruptions from Trump, Clinton argued that Trump had repeatedly mocked women for their looks, and sought to shame and demean them privately and in the workplace.\n\n\n\n\u201cDonald thinks belittling women makes him bigger,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cHe goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a woman anywhere that doesn\u2019t know what that feels like.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNobody has more respect for women than I do,\u201d Trump shot back, drawing gasps from the audience.\n\n\n\nWallace had to remind the crowd to stay quiet.\n\n\n\nLater, Trump lit up social media for muttering into the microphone: \u201cSuch a nasty woman.\u201d\n\n\n\nFemale voters make up an outsize portion of the electorate and may very well be responsible for sending Trump to a huge defeat on Nov. 8.\n\n\n\nTrump shocks with refusal to accept election results\n\n\n\nMany Republicans were tired of Trump\u2019s talk about a rigged election before his remarks on Wednesday night that he would not commit to accepting the legitimacy of the vote count on Election Day.\n\n\n\nTrump said there are \"millions of people\" who are registered to vote illegally, alleged that the media has \u201cpoisoned the minds of the voters,\u201d and pledged to keep the nation in \u201csuspense\u201d over whether he\u2019d concede the race to Clinton.\n\n\n\nThose remarks were received with bewilderment from Wallace, who noted the nation\u2019s long history of \u201cpeaceful transfer of power.\u201d\n\n\n\nClinton was not as charitable.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s horrifying,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks set him apart from his running mate, Mike Pence Michael (Mike) Richard PenceTop Pence adviser was on Trump-Zelensky phone call at center of whistleblower complaint: report Democrats probing whether groups booked Trump hotel rooms to earn president's favor: report Karen Pence launches an Instagram account MORE, who has said the ticket would \u201cabsolutely\u201d accept the results, and from his daughter Ivanka, who said she expected her father to abide by the vote count.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s critics seized on his remarks after the debate, and Republicans down the ballot will be forced to weigh in over the coming days.\n\n\n\nSeveral jumped at the chance.\n\n\n\n\u201c.@realDonaldTrump saying that he might not accept election results is beyond the pale,\u201d tweeted Sen.
