    "content": "They used to be called \u201c megalomaniacs \u201d , people who had outsized , larger than life images of themselves . Today they \u2019 re described as having narcissistic personality disorder , characterized by a sense of their own grandiose uniqueness . Not having a true sense of their own self , narcissists create themselves in the roles they play . They are the heroes of their own lives . Everyone else is a bit player . James Comey was such a man . He was Hamlet . Everyone else was Rosencrantz and Guildenstern .\nComey identified with theologian Reinhold Niebuhr , who believed that political life should serve moral ends . And being a prosecutor , Comey believed , meant doing the right thing \u201c by definition. \u201d Think of it as a syllogism . If A is a prosecutor , then A is doing the right thing . A is a prosecutor . Therefore A is doing the right thing . Quod erat demonstrandum\nThen , when his downfall came , when he was fired by President Trump , Comey saw himself as Saint Thomas Becket , Archbishop of Canterbury , Henry II \u2019 s \u201c meddlesome priest. \u201d That \u2019 s what he told the Senate Intelligence Committee on June 8 .\nTwo days after he was inaugurated , President Trump hosted a ceremony to honor law enforcement officers and officials . They \u2019 d had a lot to deal with , considering the Antifa riots , the shattering of storefront windows , and other conspiracies to harm Trump voters , like sending a nasty gas that could cause burns and blindness through the ventilation system at one of the inauguration balls . Throughout these events , the officers had handled themselves with magnificence and restraint .\nAs the head of America \u2019 s top law enforcement agency , no rational person would think to question why John Comey would attend that ceremony . Yet Comey was uneasy . He wanted to go , but he worried that his very presence would send heads a spinning and tongues a wagging . He \u2019 d be seen as having too close a relationship with the White House .\nWhereas Hamlet , as he told his mom , knew not \u201c seems , \u201d Comey did . So he devised a plan , which he confided to the Brookings Institution \u2019 s Benjamin Wittes , who in turn related it to The New York Times .\nComey would choose a costume to match the d\u00e9cor of the Blue Room , where the ceremony was to be held . He would wear a dark blue suit that would blend in with the room \u2019 s dark blue draperies . Like a chameleon , he \u2019 d disappear into the background , all 6 foot 8 inches of him . This sort of thing works in a French farce , and one can \u2019 t but wonder how Comey would have handled the situation had the drapes been orange paisley .\nBut there was no hiding from the sharp-eyed President . He spotted Comey amongst the folds of the drapes and beckoned him come . Comey put on a happy face as he boldly strode across the room to where the President was waiting , his right hand outstretched . That \u2019 s when Comey was treated to the famous Trump handshake .\nWe \u2019 re all now familiar with that handshake . When you take his hand he grips it and jerks you towards him . If he \u2019 s in a position to do so , he \u2019 ll then put his left hand on your left arm , like you \u2019 ve always been best buds . We \u2019 ve seen him do it with Justin Trudeau , Shinzo Abe and Emmanuel Macron , among others .

Honi soit qui mal y pense .\nBut if you \u2019 re Jim Comey , you discern the hidden meaning behind every gesture , and he perceived that his virtue had been compromised . So much so , that he had to defend it . Rather , his friend Mr. Wittes had to .
