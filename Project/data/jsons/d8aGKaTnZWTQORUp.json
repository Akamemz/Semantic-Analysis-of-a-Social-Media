Ironically , as Congress has become less hospitable to gun safety laws , and as conservative Republican legislators have grown more strident in their desire to see citizens carry open and concealed weapons everywhere\u2014in churches and schools , on college campuses , at bars and restaurants\u2014the one venue that has grown more gun-free , more secure and more restrictive is the building they work in .\nUntil 1983 , there were no metal detectors at the entryways to the Capitol .

No requirement that American taxpayers reserve advance tickets , queue up in a subterranean visitors \u2019 center and be guided through a select few rooms of the complex .
