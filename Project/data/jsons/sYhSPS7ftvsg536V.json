    "content": "The St. Louis police chief has asked for the FBI 's help investigating what he believes was a hate crime attack against a woman in the same Bosnian neighborhood where a man was beaten to death days earlier by hammer-wielding teens , and where assaults have spiked dramatically in recent months .\nThe 26-year-old Bosnian-American woman told police she was stopped in her car by three African-American teens early Friday morning in the city 's Bevo Mill section , where tens of thousands of Bosnians settled following the civil war in the former Yugoslavia 20 years ago . The incident occurred just blocks from where Zemir Begic , a 32-year-old Bosnian-American , was beaten to death by teenagers with hammers a week earlier .\nOne of the assailants flashed a gun and ordered the woman out of her vehicle and another hit the woman 's windshield with what police believe was a crowbar , authorities said .\n`` You 're Bosnian , '' one of the suspects allegedly said . `` I should just kill you now . ''\nThe woman , who was pulled from the car and then beaten , was found unconscious by a passerby , police said . The alleged statement prompted St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson to present the case to the FBI .\n`` As of now , officers are investigating this incident as a bias crime based on the victim 's account of the incident , '' the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department said in an email Monday . `` The investigation is ongoing . ''\nAuthorities said they do n't believe the attacks on Begic and the woman are related , but acknowledged a disturbing rise in violent crime in the area in recent months . Although police have not made a connection , the crime spike coincides with the rioting that followed the August police shooting of a black teenager by a white police officer in nearby Ferguson , Mo .\nBevo Mill residents , whose neighborhood has seen a cumulative 24-percent rise in aggravated assaults over the last three months , say assaults and threats by packs of teenagers against Bosnians have become the norm . One who spoke to FoxNews.com on condition of anonymity due to safety reasons claims he and his family experienced a similar attack and said there is a disturbing pattern of violence against white residents in the area .\n`` It is common for African-American teens to walk in the middle of the street and block in cars at intersections , '' said the man , who has lived in the neighborhood for half a decade . `` We have been stopped at intersections in Bevo and our car attacked by teens who pound on the car -- laughing at us . ''\n`` They only do this to white individuals , who they have learned will generally not respond . There is a pattern here and it is racially motivated , '' he alleged . `` Many of us are arming ourselves in order to avoid becoming the next victim to be beaten to death in the streets . ''\n`` Overall the whole neighborhood is on alert , '' Alderman Carol Howard told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch . `` There \u2019 s been an uptick in crime since August .
