But in a way , it also demonstrates that no particular major challenge preoccupies him . There \u2019 s plenty of time for O \u2019 Rourke to fill in these details . But for now , he lacks a big policy idea around which to build his candidacy . \u201d Greg Sargent , Washington Post\n\u201c As impressive as Beto \u2019 s show of fundraising force was , it doesn \u2019 t change the assessment that he brings nothing of gravity to a deep , diverse , and experienced Democratic field\u2026 he is a man without a clear political ideology , a signature legislative achievement , a major policy issue , or a concrete agenda for the country . All the fundraising in the world won \u2019 t change the substance of Beto \u2019 s campaign ; it simply confirms that a sizable slice of the Democratic Party likes the style of it. \u201d Josh Voorhees , Slate\nThe right believes Beto is a formidable candidate in the Democratic primary , and sees similarities to Obama .\nThe right believes Beto is a formidable candidate in the Democratic primary , and sees similarities to Obama .\n\u201c He is young .
