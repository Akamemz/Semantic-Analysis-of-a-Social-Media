And yet , only 1 in 10 believe that Congress is going to do anything to make those changes .\nWhich makes you wonder , what planet do they live on ?\nLike clockwork , Democrats are blaming President Trump \u2019 s rhetoric and his Republican supporters for inspiring deadly gun violence .\nGUN CONTROL PLANS OFTEN GO TOO FAR , DEM PROFESSOR TELLS TUCKER CARLSON\nDemocratic presidential contender Sen. Bernie Sanders , I-Vt. , tweeted Sunday : \u201c We must come together and reject this dangerous and growing culture of bigotry espoused by Trump and his allies . Instead of wasting money putting children in cages , we must seriously address the scourge of violent bigotry and domestic terrorism . \u201d\nMeanwhile , Republicans are offering their perfunctory thoughts and prayers , blaming video games , and calling for a renewed focus on mental health to reduce gun violence .\nPresident Trump said Monday : \u201c We must stop the glorification of violence in our society . This includes the gruesome video games that are now commonplace . It is too easy for troubled youth to surround themselves with a culture that celebrates violence . We must stop or substantially reduce this and it has to begin immediately . \u201d\nI \u2019 m not an expert on gun control or mass shootings , but I am an expert on communication and persuasion . And I can tell you with 100 percent certainty that if you want to change America \u2019 s gun laws , calling President Trump and his supporters racists \u2013 and blaming them for the horrible shooting deaths over the weekend \u2013 will get you nowhere .\nIn fact , the more you smear Trump \u2019 s followers , the more they will dig in .\nWhile calling Trump supporters names may make some people feel good , it will do nothing to make the Trump backers reconsider their positions . And in a democracy where the support of voters is needed to make changes , persuasion still matters .\nAs a persuasion expert from a red district , I have some advice for Democrats trying to get commonsense gun legislation passed , for Republicans who want to see real change happen , and for independents who don \u2019 t want to see one more senseless shooting occur .\nIf you don \u2019 t start to understand those on the other side , even if you think they \u2019 re flat-out wrong , you will create the wrong argument and go nowhere .\nMy advice is that the time to call out the president and his supporters is not now .\nBy lumping a large group of diverse people under one offensive moniker , you will not persuade conservatives to distance themselves from Trump or rethink their positions on gun control . In fact , research shows this will cause the president \u2019 s supporters to dig in deeper .\nJonas Kaplan , a psychologist at the University of Southern California , found that when our ideologies are criticized , we process those challenges as personal insults and cling to our beliefs even more stubbornly .\nMoreover , to be heard and create meaningful change , we must spend some time understanding and empathizing with the other side of the argument . You may not want to . You may think you shouldn \u2019 t have to . But remember : you \u2019 re the one asking people to change their deeply held points of view , so the burden is on you to actually persuade them if you want to get anywhere .\nRight now , Second Amendment supporters feel threatened that the government is going to take away a freedom they care deeply about . And they are being shamed by many in the media and on the left . Shaming people does not drive action .\nAs Hillary Jacobs teaches us in her book \u201c It \u2019 s Not Always Depression , \u201d shame is an inhibitory emotion that causes us to be defensive , angry , or do nothing at all .\nAnd so , the likely response of conservatives to the current rhetoric would go something like this : \u201c Don \u2019 t you ( CNN , MSNBC , Democrats , etc . ) dare call me racist and blame this on Trump ( and by extension Republicans ) . I \u2019 d be willing to listen and consider new laws if you weren \u2019 t so strident in blaming us for everything and insist your way is the only right and moral way . I \u2019 m a good person , too . \u201d\nBy contrast , an empathetic response lowers barriers and keeps minds and ears open . An empathetic response would show conservatives you understand where they \u2019 re coming from , even if you want them to change their minds .\nHere \u2019 s one way of approaching the conversation with a Second Amendment supporter : \u201c Trump is a racist , his anti-immigrant rhetoric caused this tragedy , and you are partly responsible because you support him and enable this . No more of your thoughts and prayers . Do something ! \u201d\nHere \u2019 s another : \u201c I understand that the Second Amendment and gun ownership are important to you , and you don \u2019 t want to lose that . I also know you are as concerned about these tragic shootings as I am . How can we work together to keep Americans safe without losing our liberty ? \u201d\nIt doesn \u2019 t take a persuasion expert to realize which one will be more effective .\nSecond , what values are at stake that people with different views can connect on ?\nIn his book \u201c The Righteous Mind , \u201d Jonathan Haidt \u2019 s research suggests that six universal moral `` foundations '' make up our world view . If you want to change someone \u2019 s mind , you must know what value is at stake for that person and present your argument in that person \u2019 s world view , not yours .\nThe six foundations are : care versus harm , fairness versus cheating , loyalty versus betrayal , authority versus subversion , sanctity versus degradation , and liberty versus oppression .\nFor Second Amendment advocates , liberty versus oppression is the most important moral foundation . They want their constitutional right to keep a gun and to protect themselves preserved .\nFor gun control advocates , it is care versus harm , meaning that public safety is paramount . They believe that their primary value is being violated because they can \u2019 t go to a place like Walmart or out for a night with friends without fear since lawmakers aren \u2019 t willing to ban a weapon of war ( which they have done before ) .\nIf you don \u2019 t start to understand those on the other side , even if you think they \u2019 re flat-out wrong , you will create the wrong argument and go nowhere .\nTo persuade Second Amendment supporters that the time to act is now , they need to know that the freedoms most important to them will be protected .
