    "content": "President Trump and Democratic leaders on Wednesday did what Washington does best : striking a bipartisan deal to boost borrowing and spending , keeping the government running into the next fiscal year and speeding disaster relief to Texas and Florida .\nMr. Trump accepted the deal offered by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer at a White House meeting , seeing it as a chance to get ahead of a series of pressing fiscal problems that needed to be fixed this month .\nBut the agreement blindsided Republican leaders , including House Speaker Paul D. Ryan , who just hours earlier called Democrats \u2019 proposal \u201c ridiculous and disgraceful . \u201d\nUnder terms of the deal , the government will operate on stopgap funding through Dec. 15 , avoiding a shutdown showdown at the end of the month . The Treasury Department will gain more room to borrow through mid-December , averting a potential default on obligations . And relief efforts for Hurricane Harvey will receive an immediate infusion of cash .\n\u201c We agreed to a three-month extension on debt ceiling , which they consider to be sacred \u2014 very important \u2014 always we \u2019 ll agree on debt ceiling automatically because of the importance of it , \u201d the president told reporters aboard Air Force One .\nThe deal marks the first debt hike for Mr. Trump , who during the campaign repeatedly blasted his predecessor for the sea of red ink that spilled across the federal budget .
