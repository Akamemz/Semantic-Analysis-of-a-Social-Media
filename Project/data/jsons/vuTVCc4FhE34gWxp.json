A plausible front-runner for its nomination who served as an actual governor and ran a profitable business. A deep-pocketed set of billionaires, including the Koch brothers, who would spend money if they thought it would make a difference. Mainstream parties getting ready to select their most unpopular nominees in years. Massive squalls of internet-fueled indignation over the seeming failure of the Democratic and Republican parties to align themselves with Americans' sensibilities. The Wall Street bailout. The failure of government at all levels in Flint, Michigan.\n\nAnd yet, not even Donald Trump, and the hole that his nomination blows out of the center of the Republican Party, has been enough to convince voters to give the party a second look. The media has begun to write its cursory stories, which only serves to convince libertarians that the fix is in: As long as you've checked the \"we did cover the libertarians, once!\" box, you can go back to the click-bait and ratings vehicle that is Donald J.

That helps people take Johnson more seriously.\n\nSo there was Johnson, on ABC's This Week, making the case. \"Be Libertarian with me,\" is his slogan. He doesn't poll well because he's not in the polls, he says. If only the pollsters would include his name. Americans by many measures are clustering around positions traditionally considered to be libertarian: stronger support for gun rights, an openness to drug legalization, a wide recognition that prison and sentencing reform are civil rights issues, a recoil over government surveillance.
