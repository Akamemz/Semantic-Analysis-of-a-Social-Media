Murkowski \u2019 s father , Frank Murkowski , added pro-drilling language into a Senate budget in 1995 that was vetoed by then-President Bill Clinton .\nThe 19 million-acre refuge , managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service , was created in 1960 and remains the largest wildlife refuge in the United States . It \u2019 s home to polar bears , musk oxen , and migratory birds from six continents , and is the calving ground for the porcupine caribou . There are no roads and fewer than 500 people living in or near the refuge .\nIn 1980 , President Jimmy Carter signed the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act , expanding ANWR and opening the door to drilling in a 1.5 million-acre region of the refuge . However , there was a snag : Drilling would require an environmental impact study and approval from Congress .\nLeaving the fate of oil drilling in ANWR to lawmakers has let this issue drag out for decades as support and opposition to drilling waxed and waned . Environmentalists have managed to successfully persuade Democrats ( and some Republicans ) to defend it .\nBut without definitive legislation supporting drilling , and without any rulings declaring ANWR completely off limits , the proposal has remained in limbo .\nEvery October , each Alaskan who has been in the state longer than one year gets a check for around $ 2,200 , a dividend from the state \u2019 s $ 61 billion Permanent Fund . The fund is larger than any private foundation , endowment , or union pension trust , and is the largest sovereign wealth fund in the United States .\nThe money for the Permanent Fund comes from oil and gas production in the state . Alaska residents are paid a dividend from earnings on the fund , not the principal . That means the dividend check can go up or down , even to zero , depending on the fortunes of the state \u2019 s energy industry .\nIn particular , the money is generated from the Trans-Alaska oil pipeline , which provides the state with 85 percent of its budget . Alaska does not have a state income tax or a sales tax , so the bulk of the revenue has to come from energy .\nAt its peak in the 1980s , the pipeline transported more than 2 million barrels of oil per day . But oil production is now a quarter of that , so the state is facing increasing pressure to raise cash .\nThe state \u2019 s budget deficit is now at $ 3.7 billion . And this year \u2019 s dividend payment from the Permanent Fund was $ 1,100 \u2014 about half of what Alaskans have received in previous years , drawing the ire of many in the state .\nThat \u2019 s why Alaskan lawmakers have renewed their push for ANWR drilling .\n\u201c This is not so much about the oil industry ; it \u2019 s really about Alaska , \u201d said Athan Manuel , director of the lands protection program at the Sierra Club . \u201c The state of Alaska has been salivating for this kind of stuff . \u201d\nBut it \u2019 s not clear how much oil is really there . And oil companies aren \u2019 t that interested in it .\nThough Alaskan politicians have long painted ANWR as a rich oil field just waiting to be exploited , it \u2019 s difficult to say just how much oil really is there .\nThere \u2019 s only been one exploratory well drilled in the territory , back in 1986 , and the drillers haven \u2019 t disclosed what they found , which some analysts have taken to mean that there \u2019 s less oil there than hoped .\nUSGS estimated in 1998 that there is between 4.3 billion and 11.8 billion barrels of oil in the 1002 area , a rather vast margin of error .\nThe federal government has also banned seismic testing in ANWR to measure oil deposits . The process involves setting off explosives or rattling the earth with 40,000-pound thumper trucks and measuring the vibrations to detect underground reservoirs . The Trump administration is now taking steps to allow this technique in the refuge .\nHowever , other parts of northern Alaska have yielded major oil finds , and the state has extracted oil there for more than 50 years , currently producing about 500,000 barrels of crude every day , according to Kara Moriarty , president and CEO of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a very mature basin , but the future is incredibly bright , \u201d she said , adding that oil finds in Alaska \u201c could be producing for at least another 40 years plus . \u201d\nMoriarty also noted that the oil industry isn \u2019 t planning to develop the entire swath of 1002 lands , keeping most of its activities in a stark , treeless 2,000-acre region on the coastal plain that is far away from the majestic vistas that often illustrate ANWR discussions .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a very sensitive environment ; we \u2019 re very mindful of that , \u201d she said . \u201c But it \u2019 s not the mountain and lake pictures that are often used . That area is permanently set aside and can never be developed . \u201d\nBut environmental groups don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s possible to develop energy in the Arctic without damaging it , even on a remote and limited stretch of land . \u201c Even if they don \u2019 t spill a drop , they are industrializing a wilderness area , \u201d said the Sierra Club \u2019 s Manuel .\nAt the same time , the energy landscape has changed radically since drilling in ANWR became a possibility more than 30 years ago , with US crude oil production reaching record highs and prices holding below $ 50 a barrel , driven largely by the shale oil and gas boom .\nNow with a glut of fossil fuels in the US and around the world , oil and gas companies are offering muted support for new drilling in the Arctic .\n\u201c If the 1002 area was authorized for leasing , we would consider it against other opportunities in our portfolio , just as we do with exploration opportunities worldwide , \u201d said Daren Beaudo , a spokesperson for ConocoPhillips , in an email . \u201c That being said , we see tremendous potential in National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska and remain focused on our projects and exploration plans in the Reserve . \u201d\nFrank Wolak , an economics professor and director of the program on sustainable energy at Stanford University , said current market conditions mean that drilling in the Arctic , which tends to be more expensive and difficult than drilling in the lower 48 , doesn \u2019 t make much sense when energy prices are poised to stay low .\nEnvironmental groups have also been preparing for decades to fight Arctic drilling if Congress ever gives it a green light .\n\u201c It \u2019 s going to be litigation like you \u2019 ve never seen from the environmental community , \u201d Wolak said . \u201c Why take that on when oil prices are at their current levels ? \u201d\nAlaskans who are close to ANWR are divided on it\nBernadette Demientieff , a member of the Gwich \u2019 in tribe and executive director of the Gwich \u2019 in Steering Committee , said her tribe considers the coastal plain of the refuge to be sacred and that it should be protected from drilling .\nThe tribe historically followed caribou herds in the region , which spend part of the year on the coastal plain , but have faced increasing pressure as average temperatures in the region have risen .\n\u201c Many of our people now have to travel hundreds and hundreds of miles just to hunt the caribou we have depended on , \u201d Demientieff said .\nNow the tribe is concerned that caribou herds will decline further with the advent of drilling , just as herd numbers have fallen in other areas of Alaska \u2019 s north slope where mineral extraction is permitted .\nThe prospect of losing a valuable food source and cultural element would be devastating to a people that are already facing immense environmental pressures .\n\u201c Not only our we dealing with climate change , it \u2019 s also food security , it \u2019 s also our identity , \u201d Demientieff said .\nBut other indigenous groups have thrown their weight behind drilling proposals .\nIn September , the Voice of the Arctic I\u00f1upiat , a group representing indigenous people in the region , came out in favor of energy development in ANWR .\n\u201c Collectively , we are concerned about the future of our communities and , as of today , we stand together , with our members from Kaktovik , in support of ANWR development as part of the economic solution for the Arctic Slope region , \u201d John Hopson Jr. , mayor of Wainwright , Alaska , and vice chair of Voice of the Arctic I\u00f1upiat , in a press release .\nHe cited the need for economic development in the remote region and the potential for improving schools , sanitation systems , and clinics with revenue from drilling .\nMurkowski will have to walk a fine line here . She owes her political life to tribal groups in Alaska who mounted a write-in campaign for her after she lost her primary to Tea Party candidate Joe Miller in 2010 , and the ANWR issue is threatening to divide Alaska natives .\nThe divide among Alaskans over the fate of ANWR has an analog on Capitol Hill .\nWashington Sen. Maria Cantwell scuttled the last major effort to open ANWR to drilling back in 2005 , when she blocked Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens , then the longest-serving Republican in the Senate , from tacking on drilling to a military spending bill with a filibuster .\n`` Destroying a national wildlife refuge is not the answer to our nation \u2019 s energy problems , '' she said at the time .\nCantwell is now the ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee , where she sits right next to Lisa Murkowski .\nThe two senators have worked together on energy legislation , but on ANWR , they couldn \u2019 t be further apart .\nOn the Senate floor in October , Murkowski reiterated her case for drilling in the Arctic and called arguments against it \u201c stale . \u201d\nWe will balance the potential impacts of development , and that 's why we have not avoided environmental reviews . We will not sacrifice wildlife for the sake of development . There is no question that development & environmental protection can and do exist in Alaska . \u2014 Sen. Lisa Murkowski ( @ lisamurkowski ) November 15 , 2017\nHowever , passing the tax bill doesn \u2019 t guarantee that companies will drill in ANWR . The language of the legislation only directs the government to hold mining and drilling lease sales for the refuge . If no one buys , no one drills .\nA future Congress could also designate the 1002 region a wilderness area , effectively ending the prospects for drilling altogether .\nLegal action could easily stall the permitting process , which requires a public comment period at almost every stage of development , from awarding leases to siting to drilling , creating openings for lawsuits .\n\u201c We \u2019 re expecting litigation at each and every step , \u201d said Moriarty . \u201c If the budget resolution passes , I \u2019 m not sure you \u2019 d see production \u201d before the end of Trump \u2019 s potential second term .\nAnd even if drillers clear those administrative barriers , actually finding suitable drilling sites can be a difficult process , since oil companies can only explore for oil in the winter when the Alaskan ground is hard enough to support ice roads .\nThat means it would take upward of a decade before any oil from ANWR starts coursing through the Trans-Alaska pipeline .\n\u201c This is something that would be a very long-term play , \u201d Moriarty said .\nCorrection : An earlier version of this article said the Alaska Permanent Fund is larger than any pension in the United States . In fact , it is larger than any union pension trust , but not larger than every pension .",

If no one buys, no one drills.\n\nA future Congress could also designate the 1002 region a wilderness area, effectively ending the prospects for drilling altogether.\n\nLegal action could easily stall the permitting process, which requires a public comment period at almost every stage of development, from awarding leases to siting to drilling, creating openings for lawsuits.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re expecting litigation at each and every step,\u201d said Moriarty. \u201cIf the budget resolution passes, I\u2019m not sure you\u2019d see production\u201d before the end of Trump\u2019s potential second term.\n\nAnd even if drillers clear those administrative barriers, actually finding suitable drilling sites can be a difficult process, since oil companies can only explore for oil in the winter when the Alaskan ground is hard enough to support ice roads.\n\nThat means it would take upward of a decade before any oil from ANWR starts coursing through the Trans-Alaska pipeline.\n\n\u201cThis is something that would be a very long-term play,\u201d Moriarty said.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article said the Alaska Permanent Fund is larger than any pension in the United States. In fact, it is larger than any union pension trust, but not larger than every pension.",
