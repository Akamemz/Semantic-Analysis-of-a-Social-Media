    "content": "Yesterday , Rep. Ilhan Omar , a Democratic freshman from Minnesota , was forced to apologize for her latest foray into anti-Semitism , which triggered a widespread outcry -- including from many members of her own party . She clearly suggested that pro-Israel support among American leaders is fueled by financial interest , promulgating the well-worn anti-Semitic trope that Jewish money controls people in power and buys politicians ' loyalties . When challenged over her bigoted comment , she confirmed that was exactly what she 'd meant , specifically naming a nonpartisan Israel advocacy organization , comprised of American Jews , as the culprit . This touched off even more criticism ; the angry chorus grew louder and louder , finally reaching such a crescendo that House Democrats ' leadership team publicly called for an apology , referring to Omar 's tweet as a `` deeply offensive '' deployment of anti-Semitic `` prejudicial accusations . '' It is n't the first time she 's done something like this . Omar previously tweeted that Israel had `` hypnotized the world , '' blinding people to its `` evil doings . '' Her emerging pattern of behavior caused President Obama 's ambassador to Israel to weigh in , negatively and decisively :\n2 . Some of us remained uncomfortably quiet after her BDS flip-flop & other offensive remarks because we were aware of efforts to work with her : by colleagues , party leaders , her local Jewish community in MN . She indicated to them she had other policy priorities , not Is/Pal issues . \u2014 Dan Shapiro ( @ DanielBShapiro ) February 11 , 2019\n4.Her approach indicates she does n't want to be a consensus builder or understand others ' views . She wants to push her extreme view , embarrassing her Democratic colleagues who inevitably are asked to respond . She 's made herself a lightning rod . It will isolate her . And it should . \u2014 Dan Shapiro ( @ DanielBShapiro ) February 11 , 2019\nI 'll return to his references to 'BDS ' in a moment , but this chapter of the story concluded , as I mentioned , with an apology from Omar , who claimed ( again ) to be 'learning ' how not to make anti-Semitic comments .
