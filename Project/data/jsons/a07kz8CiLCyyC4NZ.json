It is still presented in transcript form .\nThe memo begins with the president congratulating Zelensky on his election victory , before Trump eventually broaches the subject former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a lot of talk about Biden \u2019 s son , that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great , \u201d Trump said in the phone call . \u201c Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it\u2026It sounds horrible to me . \u201d\nThis refers to Joe Biden , while vice president , urging Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor , Viktor Shokin , who was investigating the natural gas firm Burisma Holdings \u2014 where Hunter Biden was on the board . Biden has maintained that corruption concerns prompted his intervention .\nTrump , in the run-up to the transcript 's release , was accused by Democrats of essentially pressuring a foreign power to investigate a political opponent , as Biden is now a top contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination .\nOn Monday , it was reported that Trump had even ordered his staff to freeze nearly $ 400 million in aid to Ukraine a few days before the phone call with Zelensky , a detail that fueled impeachment calls and led House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce a formal impeachment inquiry Tuesday . But the call transcript does not show Trump explicitly mentioning the aid as a bargaining chip or otherwise \u2014 though Zelensky did appear to reference military aid early in the call , when he thanked Trump for `` great support in the area of defense .

I \u2019 m sure you will figure it out , \u201d he said .\nA Department of Justice spokeswoman , Kerri Kupec , said in a statement that the attorney general was first notified of the president \u2019 s conversation with Zelensky several weeks after the call took place , \u201c when the Department of Justice learned of a potential referral . \u201d\n\u201c The president has not spoken with the Attorney General about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son , \u201d Kupec said . \u201c The president has not asked the Attorney General to contact Ukraine \u2014 on this or any other matter .

Hogan Gidley , a White House spokesman , said during an appearance on Fox News : `` There 's no quid pro quo and there 's no pressure .
