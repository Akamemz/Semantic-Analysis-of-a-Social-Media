    "content": "Tomorrow should be exciting : It 's the day that Donald Trump will release his first full budget plan , which will carry with it a 10-year window over which 3 percent annual economic growth will be restored and outlays and revenues will magically match up in a way they have n't since fiscal 2001 .\nYet if past is prologue\u2014and by past , I mean the budget plans offered over the years by the George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations\u2014do n't expect a document worth the pixels it is printed with .\nBush pushed tax cuts through and while revenue dipped at first , it started climbing back up after a few years , he ultimately raised real federal outlays by about 50 percent over his two terms . He was never credible , then , either on pushing for a balanced budget and , as important , in reducing the spending of government and hence its impact on all of our lives ( as Milton Friedman used to say , government spending is the ultimate measure of government influence over the economy ; whether spending is paid-for or based on borrowed money , it represents a tax on us now or in the future ) .\nBarack Obama 's fiscal trajectory is a little more complicated . Via his stimulus plan and expansion of various bailouts , he helped Bush grow fiscal 2009 spending to record levels . But after the 2010 midterms , he lost his congressional majority and per capita spending actually dropped year-over-year before resuming its seemingly inexorable climb . It 's hard to believe that Obama had actually campaigned in 2008 on a net spending cut because he never even made the lamest feint in that direction . And of course , the national debt soared on his watch\u2014and the very notion of passing a budget rather than using continuing resolutions sunk to the bottom of the tidal basin .\nSo what might we expect from Trump 's budget plan ? His earlier iteration of his `` skinny budget '' only covered discretionary spending ( a category that accounts for outlays that must be renewed every year and comprises about one-third of all federal spending ) did n't cut overall spending . Yes , it proposed some double-digit trims to various programs and agencies , but it funneled all savings into a bigger defense budget .\nSince 2008 , overall spending levels have been north of 20 percent of GDP , which is considerably higher than the historical average for the last 50-plus years of the postwar 20th century . There 's no \u2588\u2588\u2588 to believe that Trump will put a stop to that , especially since he has promised not to touch the major drivers of government spending , Social Security and Medicare . Neither of those plans is self-sustaining , so each require larger and larger subsidies from taxpayers , especially as more and more baby boomers hit the Depends years . While USA Today and others are reporting that Trump will call for massive cuts to Medicaid , most of that will come from recent increases tied to expansions under Obamacare . Yet a huge amount of Medicaid actually goes to pay for longtime care for elderly people and wo n't be affected by Trump 's likely trims .\nWhite House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney has said the administration wants to reach 3 % levels of growth . While that 's the historic average , experts say 3 % growth will be difficult to achieve because of a slowdown in the growth of labor , capital and productivity . The main \u2588\u2588\u2588 for that is the aging population \u2014 which is also driving the projected increases in spending for Social Security and Medicare .\nAs Nicholas Eberstadt notes , between 1946 and 2000 , annual per-capita economic growth averaged 2.3 percent , already below Mulvaney 's 3 percent . Since 2000 , however , the United States has been looking at average per-capita growth of less than 1 percent a year . Sure , tax cuts might help kickstart the economy to some degree , but the plain fact is that there 's every \u2588\u2588\u2588 to think any increases in activity will be more than swallowed up by automatic increases in spending tied to Medicare , Social Security , and probably defense spending .
