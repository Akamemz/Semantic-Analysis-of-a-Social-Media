    "content": "Paul Ryan conducted an on-the-record conference call with conservative media outlets this afternoon , during which he explained how he sees the race shaping up and took roughly half-a-dozen questions . \u2588\u2588\u2588 was part of the conversation . A few notable points :\nOn polls and enthusiasm - The Vice Presidential nominee said that following the DNC and President Obama 's poll bounce , much of the chattering class began to prematurely declare the campaign over . `` We 're not going to bend to Beltway group-think , '' he said , adding that Obama 's bump has receded . `` That sugar high has evaporated , and the next eight weeks will be a battle of ideas . '' Ryan likened the passion and intensity he 's witnessing on the campaign trail to what he saw during the recall battle in Wisconsin , when voters understood the high stakes and turned out for Governor Walker and other conservative candidates . He said he 's hearing from independents and Democrats who say they wo n't repeat their mistake of four years ago by voting for Obama .\nOn the campaign 's goals - The Romney/Ryan ticket wants voters to know `` exactly what we believe and exactly what we 'll do . '' This relies on bringing an aggressive and clear message to voters , he said , adding that winning `` by default '' is n't appealing . `` We want to earn and deserve victory , '' Ryan said , so the new administration would have the `` moral authority to do what it takes to turn this thing around '' and avoid America being `` sucked into a welfare state with a debt crisis . ''\nOn foreign policy and national security - Asked if he 's felt comfortable as the campaign has taken a sharp turn away from the economy because of world events , Ryan was confident . `` I may not be known for foreign policy , but I 've delved into [ these issues ] for years . Ever since 9/11 , I saw it as an obligation to get deep into foreign policy . '' Ryan cited his 14-year Congressional career and numerous trips abroad -- `` most '' of which were to the Middle East -- as elements of his chops beyond his wheelhouse of budgets and economics . Of the current crisis , Ryan was critical of President Obama 's policies and posture . `` What we 're seeing now ares the results of the projection of weakness abroad . When you create a vacuum , bad actors fill [ that void ] , '' he said . Tying US security to budgetary issues , Ryan castigated the president 's $ 1 trillion in proposed defense cuts , between the sequestration process and Obama 's budget . He noted that the only area where Obama supports net federal spending cuts is to our military .\nOn the Obama campaign and the media - Ryan coined a new verb : `` Narrativizing , '' which he says describes the left-leaning media 's tendency to echo the Obama line and create false narratives to damage Republicans . He said it 's his ticket 's responsibility to go over the heads of the mainstream media and talk directly to voters . As for the Obama campaign , `` they 're going to do everything they can to distract distort , '' he said . `` Our burden is to reveal the facts and the truth , their burden is to obfuscate and hide the truth . I like our burden better than theirs . '' Sticking with the truth theme , he asserted `` we have no better asset in this campaign than the facts . '' Ryan said that despite a full summer and tens of millions of dollar in negative ads `` carpet bombing '' Mitt Romney , `` we 're still tied . '' He suggested that finally unlocking Romney 's substantial general election funds will help the campaign fight back in earnest . `` Now that we can deploy all of our campaign assets , I feel really good about our chances , '' he said .",
