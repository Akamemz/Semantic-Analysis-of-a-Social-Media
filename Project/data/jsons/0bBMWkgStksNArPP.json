    "content": "Tesla is getting ready to introduce a long rumored lower-cost , longer-lasting battery for its electric vehicles in China sometime later this year or early next year , according to a new report from Reuters . The battery \u2014 which has been colloquially called a \u201c million mile \u201d battery in reference to how long it can last in a car before breaking down \u2014 is being co-developed with Chinese battery giant Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd ( CATL ) and was designed in part by battery experts recruited by Tesla CEO Elon Musk .\nTesla is already the industry leader when it comes to squeezing range out of lithium-ion batteries in electric cars , and it \u2019 s expected to reveal more about the new technology at an upcoming \u201c Battery Day \u201d for investors . Musk told investors and analysts earlier this year that the information \u201c will blow your mind . It blows my mind. \u201d The company originally planned to hold the event in April , but has had to reschedule it until at least late May thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic . The company held a similar event focused on self-driving technology in April 2019 .\nThe battery is expected to lower the cost per kilowatt hour ( the unit of energy most commonly used to measure the capacity of the battery packs in modern electric vehicles ) to under $ 100 . Many experts believe that reaching that mark would allow Tesla or other automakers to sell electric vehicles for the same prices as gasoline-powered ones , thereby making them far more accessible . General Motors is also trying to hit that mark in its work with battery maker LG Chem , as it recently shared during its own big \u201c EV Day \u201d event in March , though the automaker is not expected to get there until the mid-2020s .\nGeneral Motors said last month that its new generation of batteries will use 70 percent less cobalt , an expensive and precious material that is often mined by workers who are subject to brutal conditions . Musk has long sought to remove cobalt from the equation entirely , and Tesla is getting closer to doing that in its work with CATL , according to Reuters .\nInformation about Tesla \u2019 s next-generation batteries has steadily trickled out over the last year or so thanks to the experts Musk hired and their public works , like patents , academic papers , and university presentations . The group has been funded by Tesla since 2016 , according to Reuters .\nTesla has also bought up a small handful of companies that are contributing to its battery advancements , like Maxwell Technologies .
