    "content": "Mitt Romney energized his campaign for president Wednesday night , charging out of his first debate having , by most accounts from both sides of the political spectrum , dominated President Obama in a standoff for which he was evidently well-prepared .\nThe Republican nominee was quick on his feet , polished and feisty as he repeatedly cut off the moderator and challenged his opponent on the facts . His central argument -- that Obama 's economic policies have consigned the middle class to an eroding `` status quo . ''\nEchoing the words of Vice President Biden earlier in the week , Romney said : `` Under the president 's policies , middle-income Americans have been buried . ''\nLiberal pundits and supporters of the president expressed disappointment coming out of the debate , while conservatives were ecstatic .\nRomney heads next to the battleground of Virginia on Thursday , while Obama heads to Wisconsin following a rally in the debate-state of Colorado . It 's unclear whether Romney 's performance will move the polls , but he was clearly looking for a race-shaking performance having slipped in recent weeks in several swing-state surveys .\nObama , though , fought Wednesday night to cast Romney as bad for working Americans . He slammed Romney for wanting to turn Medicare into a `` voucher '' system , repeal the federal health care overhaul and allegedly push a tax cut for top earners .\nEach candidate strived throughout the 90-minute debate to appeal to the middle-class voters who likely will decide the election five weeks from now . While Romney accused Obama of pushing `` trickle-down government , '' Obama accused Romney of wanting to `` double down on the top-down policies '' that led to the financial crisis .\nThe debate , which focused exclusively on domestic matters , was heavy on policy details and light on zingers . It was one of three presidential debates set for October and marked Romney 's first opportunity to go toe to toe with the president .\nThe debate was tense at times , with the candidates standing just feet from each other and often cutting off the moderator , PBS ' Jim Lehrer . Romney appeared to take a consistently more aggressive tone on stage , though the overall tenor of the debate marked a step back from what has become a bitter and nasty campaign in the closing weeks .\nEach candidate came armed with studies and stats to bolster his respective position -- but the central goal was to broaden their appeal before a national audience hurting for jobs and make the case for why their plans would boost growth .\nObama argued that the issue to consider is not `` where we 've been '' but `` where we 're going . ''\n`` We 've begun to fight our way back , '' Obama said . He accused Romney of wanting to roll back regulations and implement tax cuts skewed toward the wealthy and reverse those gains .\nBut Romney , citing the millions who have gone on food stamps and hit the unemployment lines in the last four years , argued that `` the status quo is not going to cut it . ''\n`` We know that the path we 're taking is not working . It 's time for a new path , '' Romney said .\nHe said Obama 's push to raise taxes on top earners amounts to a tax on the very small businesses needed for a robust economic recovery .\n`` You raise taxes and you kill jobs , '' Romney said . `` I do n't want to kill jobs in this environment . ''\nOn taxes , though , Romney sought to wipe away the caricature that the Obama campaign has been drawing these last two years -- of Romney as an out-of-touch millionaire who 's looking to make the rich richer with his tax cut plan .\nObama again argued Wednesday night that the Republican nominee is pushing a $ 5 trillion tax cut plan that would skew toward the wealthy .\nTo offset that , Obama claimed , Romney would have to either add to the deficit or raise the burden on the middle class .\nRomney , though , insisted the 20 percent across-the-board rate cut he 's pushing is not nearly as sweeping as the president describes .\n`` I do n't have a $ 5 trillion tax cut , '' Romney said . Further , he pledged to hold to his promise that it would be deficit-neutral and not hurt the middle class .\n`` There 'll be no tax cut that adds to the deficit . I want to underline that -- no tax cut that adds to the deficit , '' Romney said . He added : `` I will not under any circumstance raise taxes on middle-income families . ''\nRomney addressed his tax plan after saying in an interview that one way to offset the rate cut would be to cap deductions at perhaps $ 17,000 -- and have taxpayers choose what deductions they want to take . The details may have been meant to undercut the Obama campaign 's claims that he has not been specific .\nThe president , though , repeatedly hammered Romney at the debate for allegedly hiding the details of his plans -- from his proposals for implementing tax reform to his plans for replacing `` ObamaCare . ''\n`` At some point I think the American people have to ask themselves , is the reason that Gov . Romney is keeping all these plans to replace ( the health care law ) secret , because they 're too good ? '' Obama said sarcastically .\nObama adamantly defended the health care law , saying he 's warmed to the term `` ObamaCare . '' He denied that it was a `` takeover '' of health care and warned against repealing it as Romney wants to do .\nThe debate in Denver fell against the backdrop of a sputtering economic recovery and rising U.S. debt .
