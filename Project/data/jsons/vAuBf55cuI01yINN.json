To help keep this news free , become a member and sign up for our newsletter , Outbreak Today .\nPublic health officials are on high alert for a mysterious new illness likely linked to the coronavirus that is hospitalizing hundreds of kids across the US .\nOn May 14 , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gave the illness a name : the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children , or MIS-C. At least 339 suspected or confirmed cases have been reported in 26 states , according to a \u2588\u2588\u2588 review of data from local health departments . At least 170 of these cases \u2014 about half the total cases in the country \u2014 are under investigation in New York , ground zero for the nation \u2019 s worst coronavirus outbreak . Three kids have died .\n\u201c For the first several months of this horrible pandemic , we really thought kids were not being affected , \u201d according to Michael Anderson , president of the University of California San Francisco \u2019 s Benioff Children 's Hospitals .\nThen in mid- to late April doctors in the United Kingdom and Italy began reporting kids of varying ages , from toddlers to teenagers , coming to the hospital with fevers , rashes , and other symptoms similar to an inflammatory illness called Kawasaki disease . In the last several weeks , cases have begun to be reported in cities like New York and Detroit as well .\n\u201c Nobody read about this before . Nobody saw this coming . This is completely new , \u201d said Jane Burns , director of the Kawasaki Disease Research Center , a collaboration between UC San Diego and Rady Children \u2019 s Hospital , \u201c and it is absolutely incontrovertibly connected to the appearance in our communities of this coronavirus . You just ca n't walk away from that observation . \u201d\nAs with COVID-19 , the disease caused by the novel coronavirus , there \u2019 s a lot experts do not know about this new syndrome , including what exactly is triggering it , who is most vulnerable , and how exactly it overlaps with Kawasaki disease . Further complicating matters , kids suspected of having it are exhibiting a wide range of symptoms , with some far more severe than others . Consequently , medical experts aren \u2019 t sure whether this is in fact a single syndrome or multiple ones .\nThe good news , multiple pediatricians told \u2588\u2588\u2588 , is the new syndrome is rare and most cases are treatable , and there \u2019 s so far been unprecedented coordination among academics , hospitals , and governments on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean to learn more .\n\u201c This has really been a whole of government and whole of society response , \u201d said Anderson , who has served as a consultant on the US government to learn more about the emerging syndrome . The United States Department of Health & Human Services , the Food and Drug Administration , National Institutes of Health , and CDC are \u201c all working on overdrive to help the children 's hospital and the pediatricians figure this out . \u201d\nHere \u2019 s what we know so far about the new illness plaguing kids :\nThe new illness is most similar to Kawasaki disease \u2014 with some crucial differences .\nAlthough no one knows exactly what triggers Kawasaki disease , it \u2019 s usually found in children who have viral infections . \u201c We believe that the immune system has some massive reaction , \u201d said Anderson .\nCommonly found in kids under 5 years old , the classic symptoms of Kawasaki disease include a high fever that lasts several days , a rash , bloodshot eyes , swollen hands and feet , and swollen lymph glands in the neck . One of the most extreme complications is the ballooning and weakening of a child \u2019 s heart , called \u201c coronary artery aneurysms. \u201d According to the CDC , 5,440 kids under the age of 18 were hospitalized in the US for Kawasaki disease in 2016 .\nWhile children with the new MIS-C are being hospitalized with some of the same symptoms as Kawasaki disease , such as bloodshot eyes and rashes , they vary widely in age and more often experience heart complications and shock .\n\u201c They have cardiovascular collapse , \u201d said Burns of the Kawasaki Disease Research Center , \u201c so their heart muscle is just not working . \u201d\nThere are also kids coming into hospitals with less severe symptoms , like prolonged fevers , abdominal pain , vomiting , and diarrhea . \u201c Their laboratory studies are very different from what we typically see with Kawasaki disease , \u201d said Burns , who views all these kids as experiencing \u201c flavors of the same process with gradations of severity . \u201d\nAn overwhelming majority of the impacted kids are responding well to the same treatment used on patients with traditional Kawasaki disease . Specifically , the children have largely been treated with aspirin , steroids , and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy , or IVIg .\n\u201c All of the children we \u2019 ve treated are getting better with steroids and IVIg . Of the 40-something we \u2019 ve had , we haven \u2019 t had anybody super sick . I know some places have , \u201d said Steven Kernie , a pediatrician at New York \u2019 s Morgan Stanley Children \u2019 s Hospital .\nBut in a few rare cases , children have died .
