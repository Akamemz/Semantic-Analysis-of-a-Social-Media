But they 're not .\nAsian American applicants consistently score higher in the first two criteria -- academics and extra-curricular activities , which can be objectively assessed -- than white students , Latinos and African Americans .\nSo how does Harvard justify its Asian American quota ? With the help of category three -- '' personal qualities , '' which include vague and largely subjective factors like `` likability , '' `` maturity , '' `` integrity , '' and `` effervescence .

Alumni interviewers score Asian applicants as high as whites .\nIn other words , Harvard artificially and fraudulently downgrades Asians on `` personality '' to get the results it wants . And what Harvard wants is to suppress the number of Asian Americans admitted .\nBased on the data that Harvard was forced to turn over , economist Peter Arcidiacono of Duke University concluded that with the same application profile in terms of test scores , extracurricular activities and personality factors , an Asian American male applicant would only have a 25 % chance of admission -- versus 32 % if white , 77 % if Hispanic , and 95 % if black .\nIn 2013 , Asian Americans made up 19 % of the incoming freshmen class .
