Chris Christie is , to put it politely , a woman of contradictions .\nHoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer says the New Jersey governor threatened to withhold Superstorm Sandy relief funds unless she got behind a redevelopment project he favors . It 's a story that has changed with the telling .\nThe inconsistencies do n't stop there . Hundreds of pages of court documents reviewed by CNN raise questions about her allegations against Christie and whether she deals in the same pay-to-play politics she 's alleging against him .\nZimmer 's allegations against Christie have evolved over time . Early on , she said she had no reason to think Christie had retaliated against her . About a week later , she had implicated four senior administration officials , including Christie , in a pressure campaign .\nJUST WATCHED Gov . Christie faces new allegations Replay More Videos ...

But she said she hoped it was n't retribution for not endorsing the governor during last year 's re-election race .\n`` With 20/20 hindsight , in the context we 're in right now , you can always look back and say , 'OK , was it retribution ? ' `` Zimmer told WNYC on that Friday . `` I think probably all mayors are reflecting right now and thinking about it , but I really hope that that 's not the case . ''\nOn Saturday , Zimmer went even farther , telling CNN , `` I do n't think it was retaliation and I do n't have any reason to think it 's retaliation , but I 'm not satisfied with the amount of money I 've gotten so far . ''\nZimmer did , in fact , have some reason to believe it was retaliation , a case she laid out a week later on MSNBC .\nOn Saturday , January 18 , she told MSNBC 's Steve Kornacki that New Jersey Lt. Gov . Kim Guadagno `` pulled me aside '' at an event in Hoboken and told her that getting Sandy relief funds hinged on supporting the redevelopment project on land owned by The Rockefeller Group .\nZimmer said the conversation was recorded in her diary in which she wrote :\nJUST WATCHED Christie booed at Super Bowl event Replay More Videos ...

It is very important to the governor . The word is that you are against it and you need to move it forward or we are not going to be able to help you . I know it ` s not right . These things should not be connected , but they are . And if you tell anyone I said that , I will deny it . ''\nAlso in the diary , Zimmer 's allegation that state Community Affairs Commissioner Richard Constable also conditioned Sandy relief funds on moving the development forward .\nThe day after the MSNBC interview , Zimmer directly implicated Christie , telling CNN 's Candy Crowley that when Guadagno spoke to her last May she was relaying `` a direct message from the governor . ''\nWhen Crowley asked why she was coming forward now , Zimmer said she did n't think anyone would have believed her last May . And she worried that if she did n't say something before the next round of Sandy funding was released , Hoboken would be hurt .\n`` I was really concerned that if I came forward , no one believed me , that we would really be cut out of the Sandy funding . But as I watched the coverage with 'Bridgegate , ' you do see parallels , '' she said that Sunday . `` I just felt I had an obligation to come forward and as I look for the second tranche of funding ( to ) come through , I 'm concerned we 're going to be cut out . ''\nThe next day , January 20 , Zimmer told CNN 's Anderson Cooper that another state official had tied Sandy recovery money to development ; she said she felt pressured by Marc Ferzan , who heads up New Jersey 's storm recovery .\nEach time she told the story , the number of people she implicated in the pressure campaign grew .\nZimmer spokesman Juan Melli said , `` The information came out in stages because Mayor Zimmer was asked different questions in each interview by various reporters . She was not presenting a legal case , but was simply answering the questions that she was asked . The U.S. attorney has asked considerably more questions and she will continue to provide them with all the information that they believe is relevant to their investigation .

'' A spokeswoman for Constable said they were `` categorically false '' -- the same language a Christie spokesman used to describe the allegation against Ferzan . And Guadagno called Zimmer 's version of events `` not only false but ... illogical . ''\nCNN has obtained documents that contradict Zimmer 's story about her meeting with Ferzan , the governor 's point man for Sandy recovery .\nZimmer said on `` Anderson Cooper 360\u02da '' that when she asked for the administration 's support of a flood mitigation project , Ferzan told her , `` 'Well , mayor , you need to let me know how much development you 're willing to do . ' That was the answer that I got back . So , I mean , that pressure is there . ''\nBut , according to notes from the November 25 meeting taken by a source in the room , Zimmer spoke twice during the Sandy recovery briefing that included about 20 state and local officials . And neither time Ferzan addressed Zimmer 's concerns did it appear he was pressuring her , according to the notes .\nThe mayor 's spokesman said Zimmer , `` stands by her statement regarding the conversation . ''\nMuch of Zimmer 's allegations are based on a diary in which she says she took contemporaneous notes of her conversations with Guadagno and Constable .\nBut court records reviewed by CNN show that , in some cases , Zimmer does n't take notes when talking about city business .\nIn a successful wrongful termination lawsuit brought by a former Hoboken public safety director , Zimmer was asked by the former director 's attorney , Louis Zayas , if she took notes during her meeting with city department heads .\nJUST WATCHED Hoboken mayor : DNC did n't make me do it Replay More Videos ...

If yes , identify the method by which you maintain your calendar . ''\nThe mayor answered , `` My calendar is kept in a Google account .

''\nZimmer 's spokesman did not speak to the charge that she or her allies threatened Garcia 's job unless he hired her choice of attorney .
