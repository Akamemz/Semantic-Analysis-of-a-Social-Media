    "content": "Arizona Republicans declared victory Monday after the Supreme Court upheld the key provision of the state \u2019 s immigration law requiring police to check the status of suspected illegal immigrants during a lawful stop .\nThe court struck down three provisions of the law known as Senate Bill 1070 , but left intact the so-called \u201c show-your-papers \u201d section , leading Arizona Gov . Jan Brewer to announce that \u201c the heart of SB 1070 can now be implemented in accordance with the U.S. Constitution . \u201d\n\u201c Today \u2019 s decision by the U.S. Supreme Court is a victory for the rule of law , \u201d Mrs . Brewer , who signed the bill into law , said in a statement . \u201c It is also a victory for the 10th Amendment and all Americans who believe in the inherent right and responsibility of states to defend their citizens . \u201d\nShe stressed that the law would be implemented \u201c in an even-handed manner that lives up to our highest ideals as American citizens . \u201d\n\u201c I know the state of Arizona and its law enforcement officers are up to the task , \u201d said Mrs . Brewer .\nArizona Attorney General Tom Horne also cheered the ruling , characterizing the three sections of the law ruled unconstitutional as far less consequential than the status-check provision , known as Section 2B .\nThe other three provisions made it a crime for illegal immigrants to seek jobs , required them to carry their immigration documents , and allowed police to arrest anyone suspected of committing a deportable offense .\n\u201c I consider it a 70 percent win , \u201d Mr. Horne said . \u201c We lost the other three provisions , but those were minor next to Section 2B . The oral argument over 2B consumed almost all the oral argument , and we won that one . \u201d\nMeanwhile , immigrant-rights groups blasted the decision , saying it would encourage racial profiling . Puente Arizona , an immigrants-rights group , launched a campaign it called \u201c Stop 1070 , We Will Not Comply \u201d and called for a protest Monday outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Phoenix .\n\u201c It \u2019 s looking like Arizona just legalized racial profiling , \u201d Puente Arizona organizer Carlos Garcia told KTVK-TV . \u201c We will continue to fight . It \u2019 s an unjust law . \u201d\nArizona Democrats , who have opposed S.B . 1070 , said that the half-loaf decision demonstrates that the law is riddled with flaws .\n\u201c This law does nothing to protect or strengthen Arizona , \u201d said Arizona Democratic Party Executive Director Luis Heredia in a statement . \u201c This law is simply a tool of divisive voices for political gain , one that damages our state \u2019 s credibility and economy . \u201d\nHe said the law has cost Arizona $ 23 million in tax revenue and at least $ 350 million in spending by convention-goers . The law \u2019 s passage in 2010 touched off a boycott of the state \u2019 s tourism , convention and manufacturing businesses , although some cities suspended their boycotts pending a resolution of the legal challenges .\n\u201c The Supreme Court has said Section 2B of SB 1070 is constitutional , \u201d Mr. Heredia said . \u201c That does not make it right . \u201d\nThe decision was bittersweet for the bill \u2019 s sponsor , former Arizona Senate President Russell Pearce , who was ousted in November in a recall effort organized by opponents of S.B . 1070 . Mr. Pearce is now seeking the Republican nomination for the newly drawn state Senate seat in Mesa .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a huge win for Arizona and states \u2019 rights , \u201d Mr. Pearce said . \u201c Was it worth the recall ? Absolutely . If being recalled is the price for defense of country , defense of the rule of law , defense of states \u2019 rights , I \u2019 ll pay it any day . \u201d\nOn one point , Arizonans on both sides of political aisle were in agreement : That the real problem lies with the federal government \u2019 s inadequate response to the wave of illegal immigrants streaming over the Arizona border from Mexico .\n\u201c SB 1070 is the product of the federal government \u2019 s failure to act , \u201d said Richard Carmona , the Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate seat up this November . \u201c Today \u2019 s ruling does not help us secure the border , and it does not provide a solution for the 400,000 undocumented people living in Arizona . \u201d\nArizona \u2019 s two Republican senators , John McCain and Jon Kyl , took a swipe at the Obama administration , saying that Arizonans \u201c are better served when state and federal officials work as partners to protect our citizens rather than as litigants in a courtroom . \u201d\n\u201c The Arizona law was born out of the state \u2019 s frustration with the burdens that illegal immigrant and continued drug smuggling impose on its schools , hospitals , criminal-justice system and fragile desert environment , and an administration that chooses to set enforcement policies based on a political agenda , not the laws as written by Congress , \u201d said the senators .\nFive states \u2014 Alabama , Georgia , Indiana , South Carolina and Utah \u2014 have adopted laws similar to S.B . 1070 in the two years since the Arizona bill \u2019 s passage . South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson applauded the court \u2019 s ruling Monday , calling it \u201c a major victory for law enforcement in South Carolina . \u201d\nAt the same time , he said , \u201c the fact remains that we need comprehensive legal immigration reform and that the federal government must step up its border patrol or allow states to combat illegal immigration . \u201d\nThe ruling places a fresh focus on the immigration issue in the Senate race in Arizona for the seat being vacated by Mr. Kyl \u2019 s retirement . That could be awkward for Rep. Jeff Flake , a candidate for the Republican nomination who came under criticism last year for abandoning his support for a pathway to citizenship in favor of a harder line on border security .\nIn a Twitter feed Monday , Mr. Flake said , \u201c Supreme Court # SB1070 ruling a mixed bag at best . Wish POTUS [ President of the United States ] would focus on the border rather than the courts . \u201d\nMr. Carmona , the only candidate for the Democratic nomination , said \u201c immigration problems are complex , but the solutions are simple . \u201d\n\u201c Secure the border , develop a pathway to earn legal status and enact the DREAM Act , \u201d said Mr. Carmona , who served as Surgeon General under President George W. Bush . \u201c Leadership on this issue takes courage , but it also requires politicians to stop using immigration as a wedge issue to score political points . \u201d\nWil Cardon , one of several candidates for the Republican Senate nod , said that the \u201c unfortunate split decision on SB 1070 opens the door to more of the same from Washington : more waffling , more inaction , more \u2018 back door amnesty . \u2019 \u201d\nMaricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio , whose toughest-sheriff-in-America persona has made him a central figure in the state \u2019 s immigration debate , had an uncharacteristically muted response to the decision .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not going to brag and be here like , \u2018 Oh , we won. \u2019 I \u2019 m not going to get into that , \u201d said Mr. Arpaio in an interview on KTVK-TV . \u201c But it does help in law enforcement when you have good laws and laws that we can enforce . \u201d",
