In this he has succeeded . \u201d\nBut Mr. Putin still faces some challenges in Syria . The Islamic State , while mostly lying low , remains a potentially potent guerrilla force in the eastern desert region , he and others noted .

I am sure the Russians know that very well , \u201d said Yuri Barmin , a fellow at the Russian International Affairs Council who specializes in Middle Eastern affairs . \u201c If the Americans are not there to fight it , then who will ? It will have to be Russia . \u201d\nThe American presence also helped to glue together a Kurdish-Arab alliance in the east that is likely to unravel in its absence , he said .\nThe withdrawal could present problems in the western theater in the Syrian conflict as well . Not only will it remove the hurdle preventing Iranian forces from advancing unimpeded down the road from Iraq into Syria , but it could also fuel ambitions within the Syrian and Iranian forces to capture Idlib province , the last holdout of the armed opposition .",
