Chris Van Hollen ( D-MD ) plans to make a motion on Friday that would require Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts to decide , once and for all , whether or not the Senate will hear from witnesses in President Donald Trump 's impeachment trial .\n`` A fair trial includes documents and witnesses . And in a fair trial the judge determines what evidence is admitted . My motion ensures the Chief Justice will serve the same role as a judge in any trial across our country \u2013 to allow the Senate access to the facts they need to get to the truth , '' Van Hollen said in a statement . `` My motion requires the Chief Justice to subpoena witnesses and documents if he determines they are likely to provide evidence relevant to the articles of impeachment . It would also require the Chief Justice to rule on any executive privilege \u2013 to prevent efforts by the Administration to stonewall and delay access to the facts . ''\n`` This motion is consistent with Senate rules and could pass with a majority vote , and would preserve the right of the Senate to overrule the Chief Justice if the majority disagrees , '' Van Hollen said .\n`` No Republican can question the fairness of this approach \u2013 the Chief Justice oversees the highest court in our land and was nominated by a Republican President , '' the senator said in his statement . `` And , given his authority to rule on questions of privilege , they should not fear a drawn-out process .

When these officials were slapped with Congressional subpoenas , the White House invoked executive privilege .
