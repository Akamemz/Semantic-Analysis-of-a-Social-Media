    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) Here 's some advice : If you 've crossed Barack Obama in the last year , you might want to stay home on Saturday night .\nThe President is sharpening his sword ahead of the annual White House Correspondents ' Dinner , and past targets like Donald Trump , John Boehner and Mitch McConnell know how deep Obama 's words can cut .\nOf all recent presidents , Obama has taken humor closer to the hard-to-define threshold of what is appropriate coming from the mouth of a president .\nSure , like his predecessors he usually opens with the regular ribbing of the press and his staff and greases the way for his biting attacks with self-mockery , poking fun , for example , at his penchant for teleprompters or his allergy to D.C. backslapping .\nBut Obama 's jokes can also be daring and cut deep . With adept comic timing , the president -- whose political enemies have often put his image through the shredder -- leads his audience right up to the line ... and sometimes over it .\nIn his most merciless routines , Obama has compared Republican House Speaker Boehner 's permanent tan to his own skin tone , which according to Obama proves `` orange is the new black . ''\n`` He 's a person of color , but not a color that appears in the natural world , '' Obama once said of his House of Representatives nemesis .\nMcConnell , the Senate majority leader , has also gotten it in the neck . To pundits who said he should spend time with the Republican Senate bull , Obama responded archly in 2013 : `` Why do n't YOU get a drink with Mitch McConnell . ''\nObama 's not just playing for laughs . There 's something deeper going on . For a president who rarely loses his temper in public , the dinner offers a safety valve .\n`` It is a safer environment to take on some of those more hot-button issues and deflate them , '' said Adam Frankel , a speechwriter for Obama during his first term . `` In the course of everyday speechwriting , there are opportunities to deliver lines here and there , but not opportunities for extended riffs and humor of this kind . ''\nObama for years peppered campaign speeches with jokes about the birther movement 's claims that he 's not a natural-born American and therefore not qualified to serve as president . But it was n't until the 2011 White House Correspondents ' Dinner that the president was able to expose the absurdity of the attacks . And that was bad news for the Donald , whom he eviscerated over the issue .\nObama , the pathbreaking first African-American president , has been able to take the speech further than it has ever gone before , even broaching the taboo topic of race in ridiculing GOP efforts to court minorities by saying former party chairman Michael Steele , who is black , was in the `` heezy '' -- urban slang for house .\nObama gets away with dropping the anvil like this because he often delivers his jokes with a wink and a wide smile , bringing the audience along with a conspiratorial chuckle as he scans a punch line before saying it out loud .\nBut aides said that he is careful to chose his targets , viewing political opponents and the powerful as fair game .\n`` He does n't want to be nasty . He does n't want to hurt anybody personally , '' said a senior Obama administration official , speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the president 's views of the speech .\n`` So much of the conversation in Washington caters to the extreme -- either the trivial or the hyperbolic -- and humor is a good way to poke holes in both , '' said the administration official . `` There are things he would n't say in a press conference , for example , because they would come across as whiny or self-aggrandizing , but he can say them through humor at the dinner .

Bush 's first press secretary . `` Humor is a shield because if people like you they will tend to give you the benefit of the doubt . It is a sword because one of the most effective ways to make fun of your opposition is humor as opposed to direct , frontal , mean-spirited attacks . ''\nEven so , some Republicans balk at Obama 's caustic style , which comports with their view that the president has elevated partisanship to new levels .\nAnd when Obama hits his stride , it 's not always comfortable in the cavernous Washington Hilton ballroom . Like the best comedians , his most barbed lines often trigger a second of shock before the laughs .\nBut it 's not just Obama 's personal style that has made the annual event rawer ; so have the times .\n`` The White House Correspondents ' Dinner is edgier than it used to be , '' said Robert Lehrman , once a speechwriter for former Vice President Al Gore , who has written a manual for political speechwriters .\n`` I think everything else has gotten more hostile in politics now . Especially on the Hill . So why not jokes ? ''\nObama 's is a brand of humor to match a polarized age where the stand-up gags of late-night hosts on broadcast TV seem tame compared to the satirical swipes of Comedy Central -- and when a veneer of good humored bipartisanship has long since been torn away .\nFormer President Ronald Reagan once lobbed gentle one-liners at the White House Correspondents ' Dinner like he was joshing show-biz pals at a roast or warming up the audience at the `` The Tonight Show . ''\nThree decades later , Obama 's humor is more cruel , more personal and inherently more political .\nJeff Shesol , a speechwriter who prepped Bill Clinton for the big night when he was in the White House , said presidents must show they are comfortable with power but can also laugh at themselves .\n`` This is n't just light entertainment . It 's a high-wire act for the president , and more so in the last decade or so than it used to be . We live in a different era , '' Shesol said .\nPoliticians are frequent targets , but not the only ones .

''\nA year later , when political gravity dragged him down , he joked : `` I know my approval ratings are still very high in the country of my birth . ''\nBut Obama ca n't hold a candle to Bush when it comes to self-mockery .\nFamously comfortable in own his skin , the 43rd president delighted in using the speech to defang critics who saw him as anti-intellectual , callow and not up to the job .\nOnce he appeared on stage with an impersonator to mock his malapropisms and pronunciation of the word `` nuclear .

Hide Caption 1 of 10 Photos: 'Nerd Prom': 8 memorable moments And whether the night is full of moments to remember or awkward silences to forget depends on whether you are the butt of the joke. Hide Caption 2 of 10 Photos: 'Nerd Prom': 8 memorable moments At a monumental farewell speech at the dinner in 2000, it was time for President Bill Clinton to put on a show himself that many would remember. \"Now, I know lately I haven't done a very good job at creating controversy, and I'm sorry for that. You all have so much less to report,\" Clinton said. He then proceeded to show a short film of how he was coming to terms with leaving the White House: solemnly wandering around the White House alone, making origami paper designs, trimming the hedges of the White House lawn and with everyone gone, including Hillary, taking calls and messages intended for his staff. Hide Caption 3 of 10 Photos: 'Nerd Prom': 8 memorable moments In one of the most brutal presidential roasts, comedian Stephen Colbert tore into President George W. Bush's foreign policy in 2006, hammering the 43rd President over the Iraq War. \"I believe the government that governs best is the government that governs least,\" Colbert deadpanned, \"and by these standards, we have set up a fabulous government in Iraq.\" Some Bush supporters left the room. Hide Caption 4 of 10 Photos: 'Nerd Prom': 8 memorable moments While Bush played it cool during Colbert's roast, the White House was reportedly so angry that staffers ensured that a safer and friendlier comic, impressionist Rich Little, was invited to perform at 2007's dinner. Little had not performed at such a gathering since the Reagan years and some found his jokes and Nixon impressions stale and unmemorable. However, Little's selection was memorable in itself because it was viewed as a direct reaction to the ruthless roast of Bush in 2006. Hide Caption 5 of 10 Photos: 'Nerd Prom': 8 memorable moments The usually reserved first lady Laura Bush surprised everyone in 2005 when she took the podium and showed Americans a different side of herself and began to skewer her husband. \"I am married to the President of the United States, and here's our typical evening: Nine o'clock, Mr. Excitement here is sound asleep, and I'm watching 'Desperate Housewives' \u2014 with Lynne Cheney,\" Bush said. \"Ladies and gentlemen, I am a desperate housewife. I mean, if those women on that show think they're desperate, they ought to be with George.\" Hide Caption 6 of 10 Photos: 'Nerd Prom': 8 memorable moments In 2011, comedian Seth Myers got rave reviews for his performance at the White House Correspondents Dinner, but real estate mogul Donald Trump was clearly not amused. \"Donald Trump has been saying that he will run for president as a Republican,\" Myers sneered, \"which is surprising, because I just assumed he was running as a joke.\" Trump remained expressionless and silent amid a sea of laughter. Myers wasn't done: \"Donald Trump often appears on Fox, which is ironic, because a fox often appears on Donald Trump's head.\" Hide Caption 7 of 10 Photos: 'Nerd Prom': 8 memorable moments Trump's troubles did not end with Seth Myers' hits at the 2011 dinner. President Barack Obama mocked Trump's \"birther campaign,\" in which he pushed Obama to release his birth certificate to prove that he was not born in Kenya. \"Now, I know that he's taken some flak lately, but no one is prouder to put this birth certificate to rest than The Donald,\" Obama said. \"Now he can get to focusing on the issues that matter. Like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened at Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?\" Hide Caption 8 of 10 Photos: 'Nerd Prom': 8 memorable moments Fresh off winning a second term in the White House, Obama started the 2013 dinner with a bang by walking onto the stage to DJ Khaled's song \"All I Do Is Win.\" \"How do you like my new entrance music?\" Obama asked. He then proceeded to hint that during his second term he might now be dancing to a different tune: \"Actually, my advisers were a little worried about the new rap entrance music. They are a little more traditional. They suggested that I should start with some jokes at my own expense, just take myself down a peg. I was like, guys, after four and a half years, how many pegs are there left?\" Hide Caption 9 of 10 Photos: 'Nerd Prom': 8 memorable moments In addition to Obama's comic address, Conan O'Brien managed to pull off one of the funniest WHCD performances of all time in 2013. He took shots at everyone, including the media, utilizing the metaphor of high school cliques: \"Fox is the jocks. MSNBC is the nerds. Bloggers are the goths. NPR is the table for kids with peanut allergies. Al Jazeera is the weird foreign exchange student nobody talks to. Print media, you're the poor kid who died sophomore year in a car crash.
