Here \u2019 s a little reality check for conservatives and libertarians who fantasize about \u201c going back \u201d to free market medicine \u2014 we haven \u2019 t had anything resembling a free health care market since World War II and we will never have one .

What the voters really want is cheap , accessible care \u2014 any way they can get it .\nFree market purists , including yours truly , believe the best way to achieve that goal is through unfettered competition and open markets . But if one follows that line of reasoning to its logical conclusion , it means that that the government \u2014 both state and federal \u2014 must stay completely out of health care . Medicare , Medicaid , and every other government health care program would have to be repealed . The public wouldn \u2019 t stand for it .

This means that no American who failed to buy coverage last year will owe the IRS a dime in penalties , fines , taxes , or whatever Chief Justice John Roberts is calling them these days .

The bill repeals Obamacare \u2019 s cap on contributions to FSAs , which were unlimited before the advent of President Obama \u2019 s \u201c signature domestic achievement. \u201d This cap was particularly hard on parents of special needs children , many of whom used FSAs to pay for special needs education .\nThe much-maligned GOP plan also eliminates the high medical bill tax .

The \u201c Affordable Care Act \u201d jacked that percentage up to 10 percent . The much-maligned Republican plan also reduces Obamacare \u2019 s HSA tax . Haven \u2019 t heard about that one ? Obamacare increased the tax on early withdrawals from an HSA from 10 to 20 percent . The American Health Care Act takes that back down to 10 percent . The plan also eliminates the moronic medical device tax , a natural born job killer .\nThe list goes on and on , yet conservatives and libertarians are kvetching because of provisions like the 30 % premium surcharge that the bill would allow insurers to charge patients who wait until they are ill to buy coverage . Countless commentators have conflated this with the individual mandate , but such comparisons are ridiculous . The individual mandate requires you to buy health insurance simply because you are alive , an outrageous assault on personal liberty .
