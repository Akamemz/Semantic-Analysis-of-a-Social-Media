They also take revenge on those who work around the Blob.\n\nHere's one more sad example:\n\nBen Chavis, founder and principal of the American Indian Public Charter Schools, got permission to compete with the Blob in Oakland, Calif. Chavis vowed, \"We'll outperform the other schools in five years.\" He did. Kids at the three schools he runs now have some of the highest test scores in California.\n\nHis schools excel even though the government spends less on them.\n\nBut Chavis paid his wife to do accounting work, rented property to his schools and didn't follow all of the Blob's rules.

One sobbing mother pleaded with the board: \"As soon as (my son) goes to this school, he's a top student. \u2026 And now you guys want to take that away from me.\" Many students implored, \"Please don't close down our school!\"\n\nThe school board voted to close the schools anyway.\n\nThe students will now probably have to go to Oakland's government-run schools, which are not as good. We asked to talk to members of the Oakland School Board, but they refused.\n\nChavis, though, explained how working with his wife and renting space to the schools\u2014regarded by the board as too incestuous\u2014saved government money.\n\n\"Yes.
