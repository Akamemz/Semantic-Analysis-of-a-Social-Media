Senator Sanders has traveled widely in his life \u2014 he found much to praise in the Soviet Union while honeymooning there, and said so \u2014 but he is, like many American progressives, almost completely parochial.

A generation of reform \u2014 including tax cuts and reductions in the scope of the public sector \u2014 have left the Scandinavian countries with lower public-sector spending than such European standard-bearers as France and Belgium. In the Heritage Foundation\u2019s economic-liberty rankings, the Scandinavian countries come in right alongside the United States \u2014 and behind such market-oriented leaders as Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore. On many scores, the Scandinavian countries offer more robust free-market systems than does the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother thing the Scandinavian countries have in common: Their politicians may talk about health care as a right sometimes, too, but in none of those countries is health care free.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere isn\u2019t a single \u201cScandinavian\u201d model of health care, but there are some features common in the set. One of them is that consumers pay out of pocket for health care, starting with copays but also extending to many specialist services, prescription drugs, dental care, and the like. In fact, as the Commonwealth Fund runs the numbers, private out-of-pocket spending on health care is proportionally higher in Sweden (about 16 percent of all health-care spending) than in the United States (about 11 percent). Out-of-pocket spending as a share of health-care costs is higher in Denmark (12 percent) and Norway (14 percent), too. (Statistical note: There is a small difference between private spending and out-of-pocket spending, but it is trivial in the Scandinavian cases cited here, with out-of-pocket spending accounting for 98 percent or so of private spending. Also, those figures are complicated by the fact that spending levels are different from country to country, and that the United States is an outlier; the Swedes spend more out-of-pocket as a share of a lower spending total, meaning that their out-of-pocket expenses are higher than U.S. rates as a share of medical costs but lower in absolute terms.) In other countries with widely admired health-care systems, out-of-pocket spending is even higher as a share of health-care costs: around 19 percent in Switzerland and 60 percent in Singapore.\n\nThose numbers in some ways say both more and less than it may seem, in that the U.S. employer-based health-insurance system plays a role similar to the social-insurance programs some other countries (it does not perform that role especially well), and a dollar taken out of your paycheck for health-care coverage is a dollar gone whether we call it a tax or an insurance premium. It is a peculiarity of the American system that we attempt to deputize employers to administer what is in many other countries part of the welfare state. As it stands, the U.S. system retains much of what people dislike about private care while incorporating much of what\u2019s undesirable about state-dominated systems: insecurity and relatively high costs plus sclerotic bureaucracy and cumbrous regulation \u2014 hooray for us.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe numbers may not be quite what American progressives expect, but what is interesting about them is not so much what they tell us about economic incentives as what they tell us about health-care attitudes. In an interview with James Pethokoukis, Swedish economist Tino Sanandaji links the social organizing principle behind the Scandinavian welfare states to what the Swedes refer to as duktig \u2014 loosely translated, \u201ccompetence.\u201d Citizens are understood not as baby birds with open beaks being fed by the state, but as having primary responsibility for themselves. \u201cIt has the connotation that you have the social obligation to be competent,\u201d Sanandaji says.\n\nNot a right, but a duty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a matter of national rhetoric, this is strongly emphasized in countries such as Switzerland and Singapore. That is one reason why the individual mandate to carry health insurance is uncontroversial in Switzerland. \u201cWe consider the health insurance mandate to be a form of socially responsible civic conduct,\u201d former Swiss health minister Thomas Zeltner told Health Affairs. \u201cIn Switzerland, \u2018individual freedom\u2019 does not mean that you should be free to live irresponsibly and freeload from others.\u201d In the United States, the individual mandate has been effectively repealed, but even before that, the Supreme Court was obliged to participate in a silly charade that the mandate was an exercise of Congress\u2019s taxing authority in order for the law to even partly withstand a constitutional challenge.\n\nAdopting a rhetoric of rights is not going to simplify that.
