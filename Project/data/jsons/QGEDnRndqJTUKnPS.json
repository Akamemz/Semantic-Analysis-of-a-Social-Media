    "content": "This weekend , it happened again : more mass shootings in America . This time , gunmen in an attack in Odessa and Midland , Texas , and another in Mobile , Alabama , shot dozens of people , with at least several reported dead .\nAlready , the shootings have led to demands for action . \u201c How many of @ JohnCornyn @ tedcruz constituents must die before they do something ? \u201d the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence tweeted , referring to Texas Sens . John Cornyn and Ted Cruz , both Republicans who have resisted stricter gun laws .\nBut if this plays out like the aftermath of past mass shootings , from Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 to Las Vegas in 2017 , the chances of Congress taking major action on guns is very low .\nThis has become an American routine : After every mass shooting , the debate over guns and gun violence starts up once again . Maybe some bills get introduced . Critics respond with concerns that the government is trying to take away their guns . The debate stalls . So even as America continues experiencing levels of gun violence unrivaled in the rest of the developed world , nothing happens \u2014 no laws are passed by Congress , nothing significant is done to try to prevent the next horror .\nSo why is it that for all the outrage and mourning with every mass shooting , nothing seems to change ? To understand that , it \u2019 s important to grasp not just the stunning statistics about gun ownership and gun violence in the United States , but America \u2019 s unique relationship with guns \u2014 unlike that of any other developed country \u2014 and how it plays out in our politics to ensure , seemingly against all odds , that our culture and laws continue to drive the routine gun violence that marks American life .\nNo other developed country in the world has anywhere near the same rate of gun violence as America . The US has nearly six times the gun homicide rate as Canada , more than seven times as Sweden , and nearly 16 times as Germany , according to UN data compiled by the Guardian . ( These gun deaths are a big reason America has a much higher overall homicide rate , which includes non-gun deaths , than other developed nations . )\nTo understand why that is , there \u2019 s another important statistic : The US has by far the highest number of privately owned guns in the world . Estimated for 2017 , the number of civilian-owned firearms in the US was 120.5 guns per 100 residents , meaning there were more firearms than people . The world \u2019 s second-ranked country was Yemen , a quasi-failed state torn by civil war , where there were 52.8 guns per 100 residents , according to an analysis from the Small Arms Survey .\nAnother way of looking at that : Americans make up less than 5 percent of the world \u2019 s population , yet they own roughly 45 percent of all the world \u2019 s privately held firearms .\nThat does not , however , mean that every American adult actually owns guns . In fact , gun ownership is concentrated among a minority of the US population \u2014 as surveys from the Pew Research Center and General Social Survey suggest .\nThese three basic facts demonstrate America \u2019 s unique gun culture . There is a very strong correlation between gun ownership and gun violence \u2014 a relationship that researchers argue is at least partly causal . And American gun ownership is beyond anything else in the world . At the same time , these guns are concentrated among a passionate minority , who are typically the loudest critics against any form of gun control and who scare legislators into voting against such measures .\nThe research on this is overwhelmingly clear : No matter how you look at the data , more guns mean more gun deaths .\nThis is apparent when you look at state-by-state data for gun ownership and gun deaths ( including homicides and suicides ) within the United States , as this chart from Mother Jones demonstrates :\nAnd it \u2019 s clear when you look at the data for gun ownership and gun deaths ( including homicides and suicides ) across developed nations , as this chart , based on data from GunPolicy.org , shows :\nOpponents of gun control tend to point to other factors to explain America \u2019 s unusual levels of gun violence \u2014 particularly mental illness . But people with mental illnesses are more likely to be victims , not perpetrators , of violence . And Michael Stone , a psychiatrist at Columbia University who maintains a database of mass shooters , wrote in a 2015 analysis that only 52 out of the 235 killers in the database , or about 22 percent , were mentally ill. \u201c The mentally ill should not bear the burden of being regarded as the \u2018 chief \u2019 perpetrators of mass murder , \u201d Stone concluded . Other research has backed this up .\nAnother argument you sometimes hear is that these shootings would happen less frequently if even more people had guns , enabling them to defend themselves from a shooting .\nYet high gun ownership rates do not reduce gun deaths , but rather tend to coincide with increases in gun deaths . While a few people in some cases may use a gun to successfully defend themselves or others , the proliferation of guns appears to cause far more violence than it prevents .\nMultiple simulations have also demonstrated that most people , if placed in an active shooter situation while armed , will not be able to stop the situation , and may in fact do little more than get themselves killed in the process .\nThis video , from ABC News , shows one such simulation , in which people repeatedly fail to shoot an active shooter before they \u2019 re shot :\nThe relationship between gun ownership rates and gun violence rates , meanwhile , is well established . Reviews of the evidence compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health \u2019 s Injury Control Research Center backs this up : After controlling for variables such as socioeconomic factors and other crime , places with more guns have more gun deaths \u2014 not just homicides but also suicides , domestic violence , violence against police , and mass shootings .\nFor example , a 2013 study , led by a Boston University School of Public Health researcher , found that , after controlling for multiple variables , each percentage point increase in gun ownership correlated with a roughly 0.9 percent rise in the firearm homicide rate .\nAs a breakthrough analysis by UC Berkeley \u2019 s Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins in the 1990s found , it \u2019 s not even that the US has more crime than other developed countries . This chart , based on data from Jeffrey Swanson at Duke University , shows that the US is not an outlier when it comes to overall crime :\nInstead , the US appears to have more lethal violence \u2014 and that \u2019 s driven in large part by the prevalence of guns .\n\u201c A series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar , \u201d Zimring and Hawkins wrote . \u201c A preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London . \u201d\nGuns are not the only contributor to violence . ( Other factors include , for example , poverty , urbanization , and alcohol consumption . ) But when researchers control for other confounding variables , they have found time and time again that America \u2019 s high levels of gun ownership are a major reason the US is so much worse in terms of gun violence than its developed peers .\nTo deal with its problem , America will have to not only make guns less accessible , but likely reduce the number of guns in the US as well .\nThe research also speaks to this point : A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries , published in Epidemiologic Reviews , found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence \u2014 a strong indicator that restricting access to guns can save lives .\nBut even with the outrage over gun massacres , the sense that enough is enough , and the clear evidence that the problem is America \u2019 s high gun ownership rates , there hasn \u2019 t been significant legislation to help solve the problem .\n3 ) Americans tend to support measures to restrict guns , but that doesn \u2019 t translate into laws\nIf you ask Americans how they feel about specific gun control measures , they will often say that they support them . According to Pew Research Center surveys , most people in the US support universal background checks , a federal database to track gun sales , bans on assault-style weapons , and bans on high-capacity magazines . Some surveys have also found strong support for requiring a license to buy and own a gun , another proposal with solid research behind it .\nSo why don \u2019 t these measures ever get turned into law ? That \u2019 s in part because they run into another political issue : Americans , increasingly in recent years , tend to support the abstract idea of the right to own guns .\nThis is part of how gun control opponents are able to kill even legislation that would introduce the most popular measures , such as background checks that include private sales ( which have upwards of 80 percent support , according to Pew ) : They \u2019 re able to portray the law as contrary to the right to own guns , and galvanize a backlash against it .\nThis kind of problem isn \u2019 t unique to guns . For example , although many Americans say they don \u2019 t like the Affordable Care Act ( also known as Obamacare ) , most of them do in fact like the specific policies in the health care law . The problem is these specific policies have been masked by rhetoric about a \u201c government takeover of health care \u201d and \u201c death panels. \u201d Since most Americans don \u2019 t have time to verify these claims , especially when they involve a massive bill with lots of moving parts , enough end up believing in the catchphrases and scary arguments to stop the legislation from moving forward .\nOf course , it \u2019 s also the case that some Americans simply oppose any gun control laws . And while this group is generally outnumbered by those who support gun control , the opponents tend to be much more passionate about the issue than the supporters \u2014 and they \u2019 re backed by a very powerful political lobby .\n4 ) The gun lobby as we know it is relatively recent but enormously powerful\nThe single most powerful political organization when it comes to guns is , undoubtedly , the National Rifle Association ( NRA ) . The NRA has an enormous stranglehold over conservative politics in America , and that development is more recent than you might think .\nThe NRA was , for much of its early history , more of a sporting club than a serious political force against gun control , and even supported some gun restrictions . In 1934 , NRA president Karl Frederick was quoted as saying , \u201c I do not believe in the general promiscuous toting of guns . I think it should be sharply restricted and only under licenses . \u201d\nA 1977 revolt within the organization changed everything . As crime rose in the 1960s and \u2019 70s , calls for more gun control grew as well . NRA members worried new restrictions on guns would keep coming after the historic 1968 law \u2014 eventually ending , they feared , with the government \u2019 s seizure of all firearms in America . So members mobilized , installing a hard-liner known as Harlon Carter in the leadership , forever changing the NRA into the gun lobby we know today .\nThis foundation story is crucial for understanding why the NRA is near-categorically opposed to the regulation of private firearms . It fears that popular and seemingly common-sense regulations , such as banning assault-style weapons or a federal database of gun purchases , are not really about saving lives but are in fact a potential first step toward ending all private gun ownership in America , which the NRA views \u2014 wrongly , in the minds of some legal experts \u2014 as a violation of the Second Amendment of the US Constitution .\nSo any time there \u2019 s an attempt to impose new forms of gun control , the NRA rallies gun owners and other opponents of gun control to kill these bills . These gun owners make up a minority of the population : anywhere from around 30 to around 40 percent of households , depending on which survey one uses . But that population is a large and active enough constituency , particularly within the Republican base , to make many legislators fear that a poor grade from the NRA will end their careers .\nAs a result , conservative media and politicians take the NRA \u2019 s support \u2014 especially the coveted A-to-F ratings the organization gives out \u2014 very seriously . Politicians will go to sometimes absurd length to show their support for gun rights . In 2015 , for example , Sen. Ted Cruz ( R-TX ) starred in a video , from IJ Review , in which he cooked bacon with \u2014 this is not a joke \u2014 a machine gun .\nAlthough several campaigns have popped up over the years to try to counteract the NRA , none have come close to capturing the kind of influential hold that the organization has .\nThis might be changing . Between the March for Our Lives movement that came out of the Parkland , Florida , shooting and other groups like Everytown and Giffords , gun control groups are generally more organized , better funded , and bigger than similar organizations have been in the US . As a result , Democrats at the state and federal levels seem much more willing to discuss gun control .\nBut supporters of gun control face a huge obstacle : very passionate opponents . As Republican strategist Grover Norquist said in 2000 , \u201c The question is intensity versus preference . You can always get a certain percentage to say they are in favor of some gun controls . But are they going to vote on their \u2018 control \u2019 position ? \u201d Probably not , Norquist suggested , \u201c but for that 4-5 percent who care about guns , they will vote on this . \u201d\nWhat \u2019 s behind that passion ? Kristin Goss , author of The Gun Debate : What Everyone Needs to Know , suggested that it \u2019 s a sense of tangible loss \u2014 gun owners feel like the government is going to take their guns and rights . In comparison , gun control advocates are motivated by more abstract notions of reducing gun violence \u2014 although , Goss noted , the victims of mass shootings and their families have begun putting a face on these policies by engaging more actively in advocacy work , which could make the gun control movement feel more relatable . ( See : # NeverAgain . )\nThere is also an exception at the state level , where lawmakers and voters have passed laws imposing ( and relaxing ) restrictions on guns . In the past several years , for instance , Vermont , Washington state , and Oregon passed laws expanding background checks . \u201c There \u2019 s a lot more going on than Congress , \u201d Goss said . \u201c In blue states , gun laws are getting stricter . And in red states , in some cases , the gun laws are getting looser . \u201d\nBut state laws aren \u2019 t enough . Since people can cross state lines to purchase guns under laxer rules , the weaker federal standards make it easy for someone to simply travel to a state with looser gun laws to obtain a firearm and ship it to another state . This is such a common occurrence that the gun shipment route from the South , where gun laws are fairly loose , to New York , where gun laws are strict , has earned the name \u201c the Iron Pipeline. \u201d But it also happens all across the country , from New York to Chicago to California . Only a federal law could address this issue \u2014 by setting a floor on how loose gun laws can be in every state . And until such a federal law is passed , there will always be a massive loophole to any state gun control law .\nYet the NRA \u2019 s influence and its army of supporters push many of America \u2019 s legislators , particularly at the federal level and red states , away from gun control measures \u2014 even though some countries that passed these policies have seen a lot of success with them .\n5 ) Other developed countries have had huge successes with gun control\nIn 1996 , a 28-year-old man armed with a semiautomatic rifle went on a rampage in Port Arthur , Australia , killing 35 people and wounding 23 more . It was the worst mass shooting in Australia \u2019 s history .\nAustralian lawmakers responded with legislation that , among other provisions , banned certain types of firearms , such as automatic and semiautomatic rifles and shotguns . The Australian government confiscated 650,000 of these guns through a mandatory gun buyback program , in which it purchased the firearms from gun owners . It established a registry of all guns owned in the country and required a permit for all new firearm purchases . ( This is much further than bills typically proposed in the US , which almost never make a serious attempt to immediately reduce the number of guns in the country . )\nThe result : Australia \u2019 s firearm homicide rate dropped by about 42 percent in the seven years after the law passed , and its firearm suicide rate fell by 57 percent , according to one review of the evidence by Harvard researchers .\nIt \u2019 s difficult to know for sure how much of the drop in homicides and suicides was caused specifically by the gun buyback program and other legal changes . Australia \u2019 s gun deaths , for one , were already declining before the law passed . But researchers David Hemenway and Mary Vriniotis argue that the gun buyback program very likely played a role : \u201c First , the drop in firearm deaths was largest among the type of firearms most affected by the buyback . Second , firearm deaths in states with higher buyback rates per capita fell proportionately more than in states with lower buyback rates . \u201d\nOne study of the program , by Australian researchers , found that buying back 3,500 guns per 100,000 people correlated with up to a 50 percent drop in firearm homicides , and a 74 percent drop in gun suicides . As Dylan Matthews noted for \u2588\u2588\u2588 , the drop in homicides wasn \u2019 t statistically significant because Australia has a pretty low number of murders already . But the drop in suicides most definitely was \u2014 and the results are striking :\nOne other fact , noted by Hemenway and Vriniotis in 2011 : \u201c While 13 gun massacres ( the killing of 4 or more people at one time ) occurred in Australia in the 18 years before the [ Australia gun control law ] , resulting in more than one hundred deaths , in the 14 following years ( and up to the present ) , there were no gun massacres . \u201d\n6 ) Although they get a lot of focus , mass shootings are a small portion of all gun violence\nDepending on which definition of a mass shooting one uses , there are anywhere from a dozen to hundreds of mass shootings in the US each year . These events are , it goes without saying , devastating tragedies for the nation and , primarily , the victims and their families .\nYet other , less-covered kinds of gun violence kill far more Americans than even these mass shootings . Under a broad definition of mass shooting , these incidents killed fewer than 500 people in the US in 2016 . That represents less than 2 percent of the nearly 39,000 gun deaths that year \u2014 most of which were suicides , not homicides .\nPreventing suicides isn \u2019 t something we typically include in discussions of gun control , but other countries \u2019 experiences show it can save lives . In Israel , where military service is mandatory for much of the population , policymakers realized that an alarming number of soldiers killed themselves when they went home over the weekend . So Israeli officials , as part of their solution , decided to try forcing the soldiers to keep their guns at the base when they went home . It worked : A study from Israeli researchers found that suicides among Israeli soldiers dropped by 40 percent .\nSo while politicians often lean on mass shootings to call for gun control , the problem goes far beyond those incidents . Though it \u2019 s hard to fault them for trying ; mass shootings , after all , force Americans to confront the toll of our gun laws and gun culture .\nBut it seems that we as a nation just aren \u2019 t willing to look , or else don \u2019 t sufficiently mind what we see , when these events occur . Even the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School , in Newtown , Connecticut \u2014 in which a gunman killed 20 young children , six school personnel , and himself \u2014 catalyzed no significant change at the federal level and most states . Since then , there have been , by some estimates , thousands of mass shootings . And there is every reason to believe there will be more to come .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s German Lopez explains why Democrats need a bold new plan for gun control .\nLooking for a quick way to keep up with the never-ending news cycle ?

    "content_original": "This weekend, it happened again: more mass shootings in America. This time, gunmen in an attack in Odessa and Midland, Texas, and another in Mobile, Alabama, shot dozens of people, with at least several reported dead.\n\nAlready, the shootings have led to demands for action. \u201cHow many of @JohnCornyn @tedcruz constituents must die before they do something?\u201d the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence tweeted, referring to Texas Sens. John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, both Republicans who have resisted stricter gun laws.\n\nBut if this plays out like the aftermath of past mass shootings, from Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 to Las Vegas in 2017, the chances of Congress taking major action on guns is very low.\n\nThis has become an American routine: After every mass shooting, the debate over guns and gun violence starts up once again. Maybe some bills get introduced. Critics respond with concerns that the government is trying to take away their guns. The debate stalls. So even as America continues experiencing levels of gun violence unrivaled in the rest of the developed world, nothing happens \u2014 no laws are passed by Congress, nothing significant is done to try to prevent the next horror.\n\nSo why is it that for all the outrage and mourning with every mass shooting, nothing seems to change? To understand that, it\u2019s important to grasp not just the stunning statistics about gun ownership and gun violence in the United States, but America\u2019s unique relationship with guns \u2014 unlike that of any other developed country \u2014 and how it plays out in our politics to ensure, seemingly against all odds, that our culture and laws continue to drive the routine gun violence that marks American life.\n\n1) America\u2019s gun problem is completely unique\n\nNo other developed country in the world has anywhere near the same rate of gun violence as America. The US has nearly six times the gun homicide rate as Canada, more than seven times as Sweden, and nearly 16 times as Germany, according to UN data compiled by the Guardian. (These gun deaths are a big reason America has a much higher overall homicide rate, which includes non-gun deaths, than other developed nations.)\n\nTo understand why that is, there\u2019s another important statistic: The US has by far the highest number of privately owned guns in the world. Estimated for 2017, the number of civilian-owned firearms in the US was 120.5 guns per 100 residents, meaning there were more firearms than people. The world\u2019s second-ranked country was Yemen, a quasi-failed state torn by civil war, where there were 52.8 guns per 100 residents, according to an analysis from the Small Arms Survey.\n\nAnother way of looking at that: Americans make up less than 5 percent of the world\u2019s population, yet they own roughly 45 percent of all the world\u2019s privately held firearms.\n\nThat does not, however, mean that every American adult actually owns guns. In fact, gun ownership is concentrated among a minority of the US population \u2014 as surveys from the Pew Research Center and General Social Survey suggest.\n\nThese three basic facts demonstrate America\u2019s unique gun culture. There is a very strong correlation between gun ownership and gun violence \u2014 a relationship that researchers argue is at least partly causal. And American gun ownership is beyond anything else in the world. At the same time, these guns are concentrated among a passionate minority, who are typically the loudest critics against any form of gun control and who scare legislators into voting against such measures.\n\n2) More guns mean more gun deaths. Period.\n\nThe research on this is overwhelmingly clear: No matter how you look at the data, more guns mean more gun deaths.\n\nThis is apparent when you look at state-by-state data for gun ownership and gun deaths (including homicides and suicides) within the United States, as this chart from Mother Jones demonstrates:\n\nAnd it\u2019s clear when you look at the data for gun ownership and gun deaths (including homicides and suicides) across developed nations, as this chart, based on data from GunPolicy.org, shows:\n\nOpponents of gun control tend to point to other factors to explain America\u2019s unusual levels of gun violence \u2014 particularly mental illness. But people with mental illnesses are more likely to be victims, not perpetrators, of violence. And Michael Stone, a psychiatrist at Columbia University who maintains a database of mass shooters, wrote in a 2015 analysis that only 52 out of the 235 killers in the database, or about 22 percent, were mentally ill. \u201cThe mentally ill should not bear the burden of being regarded as the \u2018chief\u2019 perpetrators of mass murder,\u201d Stone concluded. Other research has backed this up.\n\nAnother argument you sometimes hear is that these shootings would happen less frequently if even more people had guns, enabling them to defend themselves from a shooting.\n\nYet high gun ownership rates do not reduce gun deaths, but rather tend to coincide with increases in gun deaths. While a few people in some cases may use a gun to successfully defend themselves or others, the proliferation of guns appears to cause far more violence than it prevents.\n\nMultiple simulations have also demonstrated that most people, if placed in an active shooter situation while armed, will not be able to stop the situation, and may in fact do little more than get themselves killed in the process.\n\nThis video, from ABC News, shows one such simulation, in which people repeatedly fail to shoot an active shooter before they\u2019re shot:\n\nThe relationship between gun ownership rates and gun violence rates, meanwhile, is well established. Reviews of the evidence compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health\u2019s Injury Control Research Center backs this up: After controlling for variables such as socioeconomic factors and other crime, places with more guns have more gun deaths \u2014 not just homicides but also suicides, domestic violence, violence against police, and mass shootings.\n\nFor example, a 2013 study, led by a Boston University School of Public Health researcher, found that, after controlling for multiple variables, each percentage point increase in gun ownership correlated with a roughly 0.9 percent rise in the firearm homicide rate.\n\nAs a breakthrough analysis by UC Berkeley\u2019s Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins in the 1990s found, it\u2019s not even that the US has more crime than other developed countries. This chart, based on data from Jeffrey Swanson at Duke University, shows that the US is not an outlier when it comes to overall crime:\n\nInstead, the US appears to have more lethal violence \u2014 and that\u2019s driven in large part by the prevalence of guns.\n\n\u201cA series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar,\u201d Zimring and Hawkins wrote. \u201cA preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London.\u201d\n\nGuns are not the only contributor to violence. (Other factors include, for example, poverty, urbanization, and alcohol consumption.) But when researchers control for other confounding variables, they have found time and time again that America\u2019s high levels of gun ownership are a major reason the US is so much worse in terms of gun violence than its developed peers.\n\nTo deal with its problem, America will have to not only make guns less accessible, but likely reduce the number of guns in the US as well.\n\nThe research also speaks to this point: A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries, published in Epidemiologic Reviews, found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence \u2014 a strong indicator that restricting access to guns can save lives.\n\nBut even with the outrage over gun massacres, the sense that enough is enough, and the clear evidence that the problem is America\u2019s high gun ownership rates, there hasn\u2019t been significant legislation to help solve the problem.\n\n3) Americans tend to support measures to restrict guns, but that doesn\u2019t translate into laws\n\nIf you ask Americans how they feel about specific gun control measures, they will often say that they support them. According to Pew Research Center surveys, most people in the US support universal background checks, a federal database to track gun sales, bans on assault-style weapons, and bans on high-capacity magazines. Some surveys have also found strong support for requiring a license to buy and own a gun, another proposal with solid research behind it.\n\nSo why don\u2019t these measures ever get turned into law? That\u2019s in part because they run into another political issue: Americans, increasingly in recent years, tend to support the abstract idea of the right to own guns.\n\nThis is part of how gun control opponents are able to kill even legislation that would introduce the most popular measures, such as background checks that include private sales (which have upwards of 80 percent support, according to Pew): They\u2019re able to portray the law as contrary to the right to own guns, and galvanize a backlash against it.\n\nThis kind of problem isn\u2019t unique to guns. For example, although many Americans say they don\u2019t like the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare), most of them do in fact like the specific policies in the health care law. The problem is these specific policies have been masked by rhetoric about a \u201cgovernment takeover of health care\u201d and \u201cdeath panels.\u201d Since most Americans don\u2019t have time to verify these claims, especially when they involve a massive bill with lots of moving parts, enough end up believing in the catchphrases and scary arguments to stop the legislation from moving forward.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s also the case that some Americans simply oppose any gun control laws. And while this group is generally outnumbered by those who support gun control, the opponents tend to be much more passionate about the issue than the supporters \u2014 and they\u2019re backed by a very powerful political lobby.\n\n4) The gun lobby as we know it is relatively recent but enormously powerful\n\nThe single most powerful political organization when it comes to guns is, undoubtedly, the National Rifle Association (NRA).

These gun owners make up a minority of the population: anywhere from around 30 to around 40 percent of households, depending on which survey one uses. But that population is a large and active enough constituency, particularly within the Republican base, to make many legislators fear that a poor grade from the NRA will end their careers.\n\nAs a result, conservative media and politicians take the NRA\u2019s support \u2014 especially the coveted A-to-F ratings the organization gives out \u2014 very seriously. Politicians will go to sometimes absurd length to show their support for gun rights. In 2015, for example, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) starred in a video, from IJ Review, in which he cooked bacon with \u2014 this is not a joke \u2014 a machine gun.\n\nAlthough several campaigns have popped up over the years to try to counteract the NRA, none have come close to capturing the kind of influential hold that the organization has.\n\nThis might be changing. Between the March for Our Lives movement that came out of the Parkland, Florida, shooting and other groups like Everytown and Giffords, gun control groups are generally more organized, better funded, and bigger than similar organizations have been in the US. As a result, Democrats at the state and federal levels seem much more willing to discuss gun control.\n\nBut supporters of gun control face a huge obstacle: very passionate opponents. As Republican strategist Grover Norquist said in 2000, \u201cThe question is intensity versus preference. You can always get a certain percentage to say they are in favor of some gun controls. But are they going to vote on their \u2018control\u2019 position?\u201d Probably not, Norquist suggested, \u201cbut for that 4-5 percent who care about guns, they will vote on this.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s behind that passion? Kristin Goss, author of The Gun Debate: What Everyone Needs to Know, suggested that it\u2019s a sense of tangible loss \u2014 gun owners feel like the government is going to take their guns and rights. In comparison, gun control advocates are motivated by more abstract notions of reducing gun violence \u2014 although, Goss noted, the victims of mass shootings and their families have begun putting a face on these policies by engaging more actively in advocacy work, which could make the gun control movement feel more relatable. (See: #NeverAgain.)\n\nThere is also an exception at the state level, where lawmakers and voters have passed laws imposing (and relaxing) restrictions on guns. In the past several years, for instance, Vermont, Washington state, and Oregon passed laws expanding background checks. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more going on than Congress,\u201d Goss said. \u201cIn blue states, gun laws are getting stricter. And in red states, in some cases, the gun laws are getting looser.\u201d\n\nBut state laws aren\u2019t enough. Since people can cross state lines to purchase guns under laxer rules, the weaker federal standards make it easy for someone to simply travel to a state with looser gun laws to obtain a firearm and ship it to another state. This is such a common occurrence that the gun shipment route from the South, where gun laws are fairly loose, to New York, where gun laws are strict, has earned the name \u201cthe Iron Pipeline.\u201d But it also happens all across the country, from New York to Chicago to California. Only a federal law could address this issue \u2014 by setting a floor on how loose gun laws can be in every state. And until such a federal law is passed, there will always be a massive loophole to any state gun control law.\n\nYet the NRA\u2019s influence and its army of supporters push many of America\u2019s legislators, particularly at the federal level and red states, away from gun control measures \u2014 even though some countries that passed these policies have seen a lot of success with them.\n\n5) Other developed countries have had huge successes with gun control\n\nIn 1996, a 28-year-old man armed with a semiautomatic rifle went on a rampage in Port Arthur, Australia, killing 35 people and wounding 23 more. It was the worst mass shooting in Australia\u2019s history.\n\nAustralian lawmakers responded with legislation that, among other provisions, banned certain types of firearms, such as automatic and semiautomatic rifles and shotguns. The Australian government confiscated 650,000 of these guns through a mandatory gun buyback program, in which it purchased the firearms from gun owners. It established a registry of all guns owned in the country and required a permit for all new firearm purchases. (This is much further than bills typically proposed in the US, which almost never make a serious attempt to immediately reduce the number of guns in the country.)\n\nThe result: Australia\u2019s firearm homicide rate dropped by about 42 percent in the seven years after the law passed, and its firearm suicide rate fell by 57 percent, according to one review of the evidence by Harvard researchers.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to know for sure how much of the drop in homicides and suicides was caused specifically by the gun buyback program and other legal changes. Australia\u2019s gun deaths, for one, were already declining before the law passed. But researchers David Hemenway and Mary Vriniotis argue that the gun buyback program very likely played a role: \u201cFirst, the drop in firearm deaths was largest among the type of firearms most affected by the buyback. Second, firearm deaths in states with higher buyback rates per capita fell proportionately more than in states with lower buyback rates.\u201d\n\nOne study of the program, by Australian researchers, found that buying back 3,500 guns per 100,000 people correlated with up to a 50 percent drop in firearm homicides, and a 74 percent drop in gun suicides. As Dylan Matthews noted for Vox, the drop in homicides wasn\u2019t statistically significant because Australia has a pretty low number of murders already. But the drop in suicides most definitely was \u2014 and the results are striking:\n\nOne other fact, noted by Hemenway and Vriniotis in 2011: \u201cWhile 13 gun massacres (the killing of 4 or more people at one time) occurred in Australia in the 18 years before the [Australia gun control law], resulting in more than one hundred deaths, in the 14 following years (and up to the present), there were no gun massacres.\u201d\n\n6) Although they get a lot of focus, mass shootings are a small portion of all gun violence\n\nDepending on which definition of a mass shooting one uses, there are anywhere from a dozen to hundreds of mass shootings in the US each year. These events are, it goes without saying, devastating tragedies for the nation and, primarily, the victims and their families.\n\nYet other, less-covered kinds of gun violence kill far more Americans than even these mass shootings. Under a broad definition of mass shooting, these incidents killed fewer than 500 people in the US in 2016. That represents less than 2 percent of the nearly 39,000 gun deaths that year \u2014 most of which were suicides, not homicides.\n\nPreventing suicides isn\u2019t something we typically include in discussions of gun control, but other countries\u2019 experiences show it can save lives. In Israel, where military service is mandatory for much of the population, policymakers realized that an alarming number of soldiers killed themselves when they went home over the weekend. So Israeli officials, as part of their solution, decided to try forcing the soldiers to keep their guns at the base when they went home. It worked: A study from Israeli researchers found that suicides among Israeli soldiers dropped by 40 percent.\n\nSo while politicians often lean on mass shootings to call for gun control, the problem goes far beyond those incidents. Though it\u2019s hard to fault them for trying; mass shootings, after all, force Americans to confront the toll of our gun laws and gun culture.\n\nBut it seems that we as a nation just aren\u2019t willing to look, or else don\u2019t sufficiently mind what we see, when these events occur. Even the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in Newtown, Connecticut \u2014 in which a gunman killed 20 young children, six school personnel, and himself \u2014 catalyzed no significant change at the federal level and most states. Since then, there have been, by some estimates, thousands of mass shootings. And there is every reason to believe there will be more to come.\n\nListen to Today, Explained\n\nVox\u2019s German Lopez explains why Democrats need a bold new plan for gun control.\n\nLooking for a quick way to keep up with the never-ending news cycle?
