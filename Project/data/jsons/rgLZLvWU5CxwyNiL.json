    "content": "COLUMBIA , S.C.\u2014Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders made their final pitches to voters in South Carolina , where a strong showing by Mrs. Clinton , who has a double-digit lead in the polls , could hint at more struggles for Mr. Sanders .\nSouth Carolina Democratic Party officials are expecting a good turnout during Saturday \u2019 s voting . Democratic Party Chairman Jamie Harrison said this week he is expecting between 350,000 and 400,000 voters to cast ballots . South Carolina polls will close at 7 p.m. EST .\nBut turnout was sparse midday at the polling location at Columbia \u2019 s Forest Lake Park .\nSome voters were still weighing their options as they headed to cast their ballots . Rana Davis , 52 years old , was torn as she walked from her car to the polling location , saying she supports Mr. Sanders but isn \u2019 t convinced the Vermont senator could beat Donald Trump if the billionaire businessman emerges as the Republican nominee .\n\u201c I probably will vote for Hillary , \u201d Ms. Davis said , sounding somewhat resigned .\nBut the real-estate agent from Columbia had a change of heart at the ballot box . She emerged a few minutes later after casting a vote for Mr. Sanders .\n\u201c I was standing there , and I said , \u2018 I \u2019 ve just got to go with who I believe in , \u2019 \u201d Ms. Davis said . \u201c That \u2019 s Bernie Sanders . \u201d\nMeanwhile , Alexia Teachey , a 19-year-old student at Benedict College , a historically black college in Columbia , voted for Mrs. Clinton at her school \u2019 s student center . Ms. Teachey said it didn \u2019 t make much difference that Mrs. Clinton would be the first woman president , but rather that she is the most aligned with President Barack Obama . \u201c I like the idea that she \u2019 s carrying on Obama \u2019 s legacy , \u201d she said .\nVolunteers for both candidates knocked on doors and waved signs throughout the state \u2019 s capital on the sunny Saturday , in a last-minute rush to get their voters to the polls .\nKorey Te Hira , a 25-year-old financial planner from New Zealand , said he came from across the ocean to volunteer because the selection of the next president has international implications . He said Mrs. Clinton \u201c makes a lot of common sense \u201d and that her foreign-policy credentials outweighed Mr. Sanders \u2019 .\n\u201c You look at the Republican side , it \u2019 s like a madhouse , \u201d he said . \u201c It \u2019 s not just bad for America , but potentially for the rest of the world . \u201d\nAcross town , Sanders campaign volunteer Roger Bouchard , 60 , had knocked on 49 doors by 11 a.m. and found 19 strong Sanders backers .\nAlthough polls showed Mrs. Clinton with a commanding lead in South Carolina , Mr. Bouchard was predicting a Sanders surge and a primary surprise .\n\u201c I think the polls are way off , \u201d he said . \u201c This is such a grass-roots effort . \u201d\nOn Friday night , Mrs. Clinton held an outdoor rally in Columbia , where she pledged to build on Mr. Obama \u2019 s legacy . \u201c We have work to do , but I \u2019 m excited about what we can do together , \u201d she told the crowd .\nShe said the South Carolina primary is personally important to her and that she wants to send \u201c a strong signal \u201d Saturday that the state is ready for change .\nFormer President Bill Clinton joined his wife on the trail Friday evening , calling their time in South Carolina a homecoming and telling voters that they can \u201c change the future of this country by voting for Hillary . \u201d\nMrs. Clinton , whose Southern firewall appears poised to pass its first test , has an eye on the Southern states that will vote on Super Tuesday , including Alabama , Georgia , Tennessee , Texas , Arkansas and Virginia .\nHer strength in the region , particularly among its many African-American Democratic voters , has been magnified by the Sanders campaign \u2019 s decision not to try to match her investment here and elsewhere . Officials in some Super Tuesday states say they still are looking for indications that he is competing in the so-called SEC primary .\nA march outside a downtown Nashville coffee shop on Saturday will feature a half-dozen , life-size Bernie Sanders cutouts , but otherwise , there has been little sign of Mr. Sanders himself in Tennessee , Democrats said .\n\u201c You kind of get the feel that he doesn \u2019 t think it \u2019 s worthwhile coming , \u201d said Randall Rice , head of the Tennessee Democratic County Chairs Association , who is neutral in the race . \u201c The Bernie group has come in and set up offices , but he \u2019 s not been here as far as I know . Hillary has been here a few times . \u201d\nMr. Sanders told supporters at a Friday night rally at the Township Auditorium in Columbia that \u201c the people have the power in this country . \u201d\nRapper Killer Mike , who spoke at the rally , said South Carolinians\u2014and particularly black South Carolinians\u2014shouldn \u2019 t feel pressured to support Mrs. Clinton because others say they should , be it their mother ( \u201c Walk past her , walk to the polls \u201d ) or their preacher ( \u201c Ask him what would Jesus really do. \u201d ) .\nMr. Sanders was headed to Minnesota and Texas on Saturday to trumpet his free-college-tuition plan , and he won \u2019 t be in South Carolina when the election results are announced .\nJustin Bamberg , one of a handful of black legislators who endorsed Mr. Sanders in South Carolina , said he wishes the Vermont senator could stay for a victory party , but , \u201c realistically speaking , how can you get everywhere ?
