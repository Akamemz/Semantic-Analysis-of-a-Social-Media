Biden captures 14 % , five months from the first-in-the-nation vote Feb. 1 . Even without Biden in the mix , Clinton falls below a majority , at 43 % .\n\u201c This feels like 2008 all over again , \u201d said J. Ann Selzer , pollster for the Iowa Poll .\nIn that race , Clinton led John Edwards by 6 percentage points and Barack Obama by 7 points in an early October Iowa Poll . But Obama , buoyed by younger voters and first-time caucusgoers , surged ahead by late November .\nIn this cycle , Sanders is attracting more first-time caucusgoers than Clinton . He claims 43 % of their vote compared with 31 % for Clinton . He also leads by 23 percentage points with the under-45 crowd and by 21 points among independent voters .\nSanders , a Vermont U.S. senator , has become a liberal Pied Piper in Iowa not as a vote against Clinton , but because caucusgoers genuinely like him , the poll shows . An overwhelming 96 % of his backers say they support him and his ideas . Just 2 % say they \u2019 re motivated by opposition to Clinton .\nBack in January , half of likely Democratic caucusgoers were unfamiliar with Sanders , who has been elected to Congress for 25 years as an independent . He has jumped from 5 % support in January to 30 % . Clinton , a famous public figure for decades , has dropped in that period from 56 % to 37 % .\n\u201c These numbers would suggest that she can be beaten , \u201d said Steve McMahon , a Virginia-based Democratic strategist who has worked on presidential campaigns dating to 1980 .\n\u201c But , \u201d he added , \u201c it \u2019 s still early , and Hillary Clinton \u2019 s done this before . She knows what it takes to win . \u201d\nIf Clinton survives the caucus and primary gauntlet to become the nominee , nearly two-thirds of likely Democratic caucusgoers say they \u2019 re \u201c mostly confident \u201d she can win the general election . About 24 % are mostly nervous , and 9 % aren \u2019 t sure .\nThe open question is what Biden will see in these results . Will he see a teetering front-runner in distress ? Or that Sanders has already consolidated a big share of the support available to a Clinton alternative ?\nIn a May Iowa Poll , just before his eldest son , Beau , died of brain cancer at age 46 , 8 % of likely caucusgoers listed Biden as their first choice for president .\nA Biden bid also would open a two-front war for Clinton . If he were to declare a candidacy , he \u2019 d almost certainly get a bump in his numbers .\nThe vice president saps support from both Clinton and Sanders , the poll shows . Without Biden in the mix , Clinton is at 43 % and Sanders is at 35 % .\n\u201c So , Biden takes 6 points from Clinton and 5 points from Sanders , \u201d Selzer said .\nThe Iowa Poll of 404 likely Democratic caucusgoers was conducted Aug. 23-26 by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines . The margin of error is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points .\n\u201c Voters right now are flocking to the angry , authentic outsiders and moving away from the cautious or calculating establishment insiders , \u201d McMahon said .\nClinton has been dogged by media questions and an FBI investigation about whether her use of a private , home-based email server while secretary of state undermined U.S. security .\nIn Iowa on Wednesday , she said use of personal email \u201c clearly wasn \u2019 t the best choice. \u201d But Clinton , who says voters don \u2019 t bring up the issue , downplays the investigation as \u201c about politics . \u201d\nSelzer said Clinton is right about the unimportance of the email controversy at this point in the caucus race \u2014 76 % of her supporters and 61 % of all likely Democratic caucusgoers say it \u2019 s not important to them .
