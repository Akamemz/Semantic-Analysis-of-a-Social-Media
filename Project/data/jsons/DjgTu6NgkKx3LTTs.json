Congress mandated both actions \u2014 the sanctions and the list \u2014 to punish Russia for meddling in the 2016 presidential election .\nHere \u2019 s the backstory : Last August , Trump reluctantly signed into law the Countering America \u2019 s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act . Republican and Democratic lawmakers crafted the bill in response to Trump \u2019 s unusual warmth toward Russian President Vladimir Putin and his refusal to blame Russia for interfering in the election .\nThe legislation almost unanimously passed both chambers , and it was clear that Congress would override a presidential veto . It was explicitly designed to make old sanctions against Russia permanent and pressure Trump to impose new ones . The bill forced Trump to impose costs on Putin for interfering in America \u2019 s democratic process and his interventions in Ukraine and Syria .\nBut Trump resented Congress \u2019 s move to box him in on Russia policy . The president slammed the legislation in a written signing statement , calling it \u201c seriously flawed , \u201d and said that he could \u201c make far better deals with foreign countries than Congress. \u201d Sean Kane , a former sanctions official at the Treasury Department , told me that most presidential administrations balk at Congress telling them whom and what to sanction \u2014 that \u2019 s power the White House likes to wield .\nSo Trump missed Monday \u2019 s deadline to impose the new sanctions . But the administration did do something else it was required to do : It released a list of 210 Russian leaders and billionaires with purported ties to Putin in order to indicate that the administration was watching them .\nThe list , which BuzzFeed reported was partially cribbed from an existing list in Forbes Magazine , included political figures with ties to Putin like his chief spokesperson Dmitry Peskov , Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov , and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev . It also included Russians worth $ 1 billion or more , like aluminum tycoon Oleg Deripaska and Roman Abramovich , owner of one of Britain \u2019 s best soccer teams , Chelsea .\nThough none of the wealthy and influential Russians on the list are the targets of sanctions , experts say they will likely face some consequences . For example , foreign banks where Russian oligarchs keep a majority of their wealth may consider cutting ties with the individuals who were named .\nWhy ? Because the naming-and-shaming list could very easily turn into an actual sanctions list in the future , said Richard Nephew , who oversaw sanctions policy at the State Department during the Obama administration , in a January interview .\n\u201c The idea [ behind releasing the list ] is to change Russian strategic thinking as Putin becomes concerned his best buds are about to get in trouble here , \u201d Nephew said .\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday that sanctions will come out of the list .\nPutin thinks the sanctions are an effort to interfere in Russia \u2019 s elections\nHours before the US deadline to impose new sanctions on Russian entities , the Kremlin started complaining .\n\u201c We do think that this is a direct and obvious attempt to time some sort of action to coincide with our elections in order to influence them , \u201d Peskov , a Kremlin spokesperson who was later named on the list , said on Monday .
