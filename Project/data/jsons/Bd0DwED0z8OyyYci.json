    "content": "For the past 18 months , as resurgent Russia- and Iran-backed regime forces swept across Syria , defeated and disarmed rebels in stronghold after stronghold were allowed to flee to northwestern Idlib province . They took their families and many of their anti-Assad sympathizers , and Idlib \u2019 s population swelled from 1.5 million to 3 million . Now a final military reckoning seems imminent for Syria \u2019 s seven-year civil war , with forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad poised to attack Idlib . The Russian and Syrian air forces have already begun to bomb . On Friday , at United Nations headquarters in New York , and in a Turkey-Iran-Russia summit in Tehran , warnings of a looming massacre were sounded . But it may be too late for diplomacy , which has routinely failed to prevent atrocities throughout the war . \u201c The dangers are profound that any battle for Idlib could be , would be a horrific and bloody battle , \u201d warned UN Syria mediator Staffan de Mistura . \u201c Either we are trying to find a political way to end this war and move to a postwar political scenario , or we will see this war reach new levels of horrors . \u201d\nThe possibility that Syria 's Idlib province would provide the setting for a tragic coda to the humanitarian catastrophe of the country \u2019 s seven-year civil war seemed enhanced Friday after a last-ditch summit meeting in Tehran of the main outside powers .\nEven as Turkey , long a bitter foe of President Bashar al-Assad , urged a cease-fire in the northwestern Syrian province and warned of a massacre , Russia and Iran , Mr. Assad \u2019 s two main backers , pressed for government forces to begin their assault on the last refuge of rebel forces in the country .\nFresh Russian and Syrian airstrikes on Idlib were reported Friday morning . The widely anticipated offensive has drawn international concern .\nAt United Nations headquarters in New York , the Security Council met to discuss Idlib Friday at the request of the United States . UN Syria mediator Staffan de Mistura said there were \u201c all the ingredients for a perfect storm , \u201d Reuters reported .\n\u201c The dangers are profound that any battle for Idlib could be , would be , a horrific and bloody battle , \u201d Mr. de Mistura said . \u201c Either we are trying to find a political way to end this war and move to a postwar political scenario , or we will see this war reach new levels of horrors , \u201d the Associated Press quoted him as saying .\nIdlib \u2019 s fall to the Assad regime would effectively signal the end of a civil war that has already killed nearly half a million people , devastated the country , and forced half its population to flee their homes .\nThe humanitarian impact has been staggering . Millions have fled to neighboring countries and hundreds of thousands to Europe and beyond , feeding an epic refugee crisis that has strained humanitarian agencies to the breaking point .\nOver the past 18 months , backed by the manpower and firepower of Russia and Iran , the regime has had a string of battlefield successes , seizing the northern city of Aleppo , Deir ez Zour in the east , the Eastern Ghouta region east of Damascus , and most recently , Deraa and Quneitra provinces in the south .\nIn each battle , the regime offered rebels the option of surrendering their heavy weapons and relocating to Idlib province , where Turkish troops man observation posts as part of a now-collapsed de-escalation zone deal . The influx of defeated fighters and their families to the Idlib dumping ground saw the local population nearly double from 1.5 million to almost 3 million .\nThe dilemma facing the rebels and Sunni jihadist militants is that there are few places left to flee to should the Assad regime attack .\nWhile Russia has condemned Idlib as a \u201c nest of terrorists \u201d that needs to be cleansed and brought back under central government control , Turkey has been calling for \u201c terrorists \u201d \u2013 a reference mainly to the Al Qaeda-linked Harakat Tahrir ash-Shams ( HTS ) \u2013 to be separated from civilians , in order to avoid an all-out onslaught .\n\u201c The [ Syrian-Russian-Iranian ] plan was clear from the start . These [ rebel ] groups would go there and then the regime would attack to capture it , \u201d Turkish Foreign Minister Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu told reporters this week . \u201c How many of them will come to Turkey ? Maybe 2 million [ civilians ] ? Maybe more . Where will these terrorists go ? They might come to Turkey or go back to their own countries . Foreign terrorist fighters can also go to other countries , to Europe or even beyond . \u201d\nKirill Kudryavtsev/AP Iranian President Hassan Rouhani ( l. ) , Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan ( c. ) , and President Vladimir Putin of Russia arrive at a news conference following their summit in Tehran , Sept. 7 , 2018 , in which they addressed the much-anticipated military offensive to retake the last Syrian rebel bastion of Idlib .\nTurkish media estimate that 60,000 Sunni jihadists are in Idlib , some 15,000 of them non-Arab foreign fighters . They remain \u201c the biggest number of [ Islamic State ] and Al Qaeda-affiliated terrorists in Syria , \u201d wrote columnist Murat Yetk\u0131n in the H\u00fcrriyet Daily News on Wednesday .\n`` Russia \u2019 s message is clear , \u201d argues Mr. Yetk\u0131n . `` President Vladimir Putin does not want to lose time letting terrorist elements in Idlib embed with the civilian population , spread violence elsewhere , and use civilians as human shelters against possible attacks , while also not caring much about the possible collateral damage . \u201d\nThe stance of Turkey , which mans 12 observation posts on the edges of the Idlib enclave , is critical to determining its fate , analysts say .\n\u201c At one extreme , Turkey can choose to defend Idlib militarily , directly and/or through its proxies , \u201d says Faysal Itani , resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council \u2019 s Rafik Hariri Center for the Middle East . \u201c If they do so , the regime can not take the area at an acceptable cost , and Idlib becomes a de-facto Turkish zone . \u201d\nAt the other extreme , Mr. Itani says , Turkey could abandon its observation posts in Idlib , effectively ceding the region to the Syrian government , though he says some rebels would likely withdraw to other Turkish-held territory , while the jihadists \u201c may well choose to stand and fight . \u201d\nSo much was at stake Friday afternoon when Iranian President Hassan Rouhani , Russian President Vladimir Putin , and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan gathered in Tehran .\nAsl\u0131 Ayd\u0131nta\u015fba\u015f , a Turkey expert at the European Council on Foreign Relations , warned that the three leaders , despite handshakes and smiles , would \u201c neither have the same vision for Syria nor be on the same page about the impending battle of Idlib . \u201d\nMr. Erdo\u011fan has long viewed Assad as illegitimate , wrote Ms. Ayd\u0131nta\u015fba\u015f , in an ECFR analysis published Thursday , so \u201c despite a begrudging acceptance of the regime \u2019 s wartime gains over the past two years , Ankara is in no mood to facilitate Assad \u2019 s victory in Idlib . \u201d\nNone of Turkey \u2019 s options look good , adds Ayd\u0131nta\u015fba\u015f , as it faces both a humanitarian \u201c catastrophe \u201d and a result that could \u201c forever alter the dynamics of the Syrian war \u2013 in favor of the regime . \u201d\nItani says he had trouble imagining what a cease-fire would look like .\n\u201c Russian contacts and persons close to the [ Syrian ] regime tell me that the difficulty of taking Idlib is exaggerated .
