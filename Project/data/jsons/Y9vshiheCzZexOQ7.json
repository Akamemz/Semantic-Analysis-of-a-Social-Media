'' They prided themselves on their balanced budgets , with little gratitude for the GOP Congress that cut capital gains taxes in 1997 and helped produce four of them .\nThey embraced middle-class tax cuts , at least rhetorically . The New Democrats were born and , politically , it worked : The populist Democrat from Arkansas transformed his party from a festival of limousine liberals to a home for pickup-truck-driving , balanced-budget-loving , working people .

As former Sen. Fred Thompson said in 2008 , `` He 's George McGovern without the experience .

It is hard to argue that Obama does not have an edge at this point .\nAfter Clinton spoke , I concluded on CNN , `` This will be the moment that probably re-elected Barack Obama . '' Hyperbole ? Perhaps . But if you think Obama is slightly favored to win this election , as I do , you might ask : What has been the best moment of Obama 's campaign ? It was n't the candidate 's speech at the convention . It was Bubba pointing his finger , biting his lower lip and rewriting the campaign plan .\nClinton did n't just give Obama an endorsement , he gave the Obama campaign a narrative .

Like Moses , Old Bill told us the greatest risk would be stopping now , in the desert , and turning back from the Promised Land . Over 2000 years , that 's proved a powerful narrative .\nBut Clinton did n't just try to rebrand the Democrats as the party of economic responsibility . He tried to rebrand it as his Democratic Party . High above the Charlotte convention center , Bill planted a Clinton flag .\nThere is a war going on for the soul of the Democratic Party .

Team Obama must have research telling them it is hard for the Romney campaign to trump Obama 's commander in chief credential . Within a week , four American diplomatic personnel would be lost in Benghazi , Libya . Biden and Emanuel were prescient .\nThe spiritual and intellectual poverty of the closing speech of the convention must have been a disappointment , even for Team Obama .\nWhether you are a Republican or a Democrat , in a time of crisis , you want your president to lead .\nObama seemed incapable of it . At his best , the Secretariat of the '08 campaign performed like an old and tired contender . At his worst , he appealed to the worst in us , continuing to polarize us for his own political gain .\nWhen a contributor is on air at CNN , viewing a small screen hung under a TV camera , it is hard to appreciate the big-monitor experience most Americans enjoy in their living rooms , bedrooms or man caves . A few days after Charlotte , at home , I finally saw the Obama speech on my big screen . I was surprised at what I had missed .\nObama 's eyes , during his moment in the light , were heavy and vacant . The Believer did not believe . He was reading his speech with a touch of sadness . I was struck that Obama thought less of himself for stooping to this characterless politics , something he once imagined beneath him . Four years ago , all of us , especially the speaker , hoped he could be a better man .\nAs a fan of political theater , I 've said that an Obama speech is like sex : The worst ever is still excellent . After Thursday night , I 've changed my mind . Sex is better , perhaps because it is less frequent .\nIn a country where nearly 60 % of Americans believe we are headed in the wrong direction , it does n't take a Harvard lawyer , Republican or Democrat , to see what a winning campaign looks like : It offers a new direction . Obama proposed none of that .\nAfter Clinton 's speech , I commented on CNN that `` I would recommend to my friend Paul ( Begala ) here , tonight when everybody leaves , lock the doors . You do n't have to come back tomorrow . This convention is done . '' Team Obama may wish they had done so . In the short term , Obama energized his base and reminded Americans what they liked about him four years ago . Any modest bounce Obama enjoys from this convention , however , will be not because he converted a new audience but because he revved up his dispirited voters .\nWith his little speech about nothing , Obama made the case for a new president better than Mitt Romney did .\nPolitics is about opportunities taken and moments of greatness missed .\nIn Charlotte , Clinton passed the New Democrat cup to Obama . Why did the Old Democrat forsake him , skipping the opportunity to take on government spending and pick up Clinton voters in the center ?\nNo doubt , there is an animosity between the two men and Obama wants his own time in the sun , not Clinton 's reflected glory .

Clinton 's endorsement is valuable to this president precisely because , on economics , Obama is much further left than his Democratic predecessor .\nEven when saying nothing , Obama could not resist boasting , of all things , about his modesty .\nObama told us , `` I 'm far more mindful of my own failings , knowing exactly what Lincoln meant when he said , ' I have been driven to my knees many times by the overwhelming conviction that I had no place else to go . ' ''\nThis man of limited accomplishment told us he was as humble as Abraham Lincoln .\nFor a moment , I feared he would also ask , `` Is n't Michelle 's husband terrific ?
