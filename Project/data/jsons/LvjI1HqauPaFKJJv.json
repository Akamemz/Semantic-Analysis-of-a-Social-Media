    "content": "President Donald Trump 's son-in-law has said neither he nor anyone in the Trump campaign team colluded with Russian officials over the US election .\nJared Kushner said he had no improper contacts and did not rely on Russian funds to finance business activities .\nMr Kushner released his opening statement ahead of giving testimony before a Senate panel on Monday .\nThe Senate , the House and a special counsel are all investigating Russian interference in the election .\nMr Kushner , 36 , is a senior adviser to the president and was in charge of the Trump campaign 's digital strategy . He is married to Mr Trump 's daughter , Ivanka .\nMr Kushner , who keeps a very low media profile , was due to attend a closed-door session on Monday before the Senate Intelligence Committee , and then appear before the House version on Tuesday .\nIn the statement to both congressional committees he released on Monday , he says : `` I did not collude , nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded , with any foreign government . ''\n`` With respect to my contacts with Russia or Russian representatives during the campaign , there were hardly any , '' he says . At the end of the statement he speaks of `` perhaps four contacts with Russian representatives '' both during the campaign and after .\nHe does refer to a meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya in June last year . She had allegedly promised damaging material on Hillary Clinton .\nMr Kushner said he arrived late at the meeting , realised little of note was being discussed and that it was `` time not well-spent '' .\nHe said : `` I actually emailed an assistant from the meeting after I had been there for 10 or so minutes and wrote 'Can u pls call me on my cell ? Need excuse to get out of meeting ' . ''\nMr Trump Jr said former campaign chief Paul Manafort was also at the meeting and that no compromising material on Mrs Clinton was provided .\nIn his Senate testimony Jared Kushner says he has nothing to hide and is `` happy '' to share information with those investigating possible Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign .\nHis written statement , however , is an exercise in caution and lawyerly discretion . He addresses only the controversies already in the public sphere , then offers his explanation for why they are no big deal .\nHe receives hundreds of emails a day and did n't read his brother-in-law 's forwarded message that said the Russian government wanted to help the Trump campaign .\nReports of an effort to set up back-channel communications with Russia after the election were a halted effort to get information about Syria from Russian generals .\nHe met with an influential Russian banker because the Russian ambassador - whose name he could n't initially remember - was so persistent .\nThe incomplete security form was the result of a `` miscommunication '' with an assistant who submitted it too soon .\nBeyond that , there are no new revelations ; no new disclosures . If what 's already out is all there is , Mr Kushner and his lawyers have done their best to defuse the bombs . When walking in a minefield , it 's the ones you do n't know about that pose the greatest risk .\nOne matter on which Mr Kushner may face a grilling is his security clearance declaration , as he accepts he failed initially to reveal his contacts with Russians .\nHe says the first form , a `` rough draft that still had many omissions '' , was filed by an assistant in error on 18 January and that declarations on his foreign contacts , not just with Russians , were added over the next six months `` in the normal course '' .\nAmbassador Sergei Kislyak ( above ) .
