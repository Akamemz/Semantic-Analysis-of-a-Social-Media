Is he annoyed by the president 's tweets about the case because they `` make it impossible for me to do my job , '' as he told ABC News yesterday , or because they make it impossible to pretend that the decision to override the original sentencing recommendation was untainted by Donald Trump 's personal interests ?\nBarr obviously wants the public to believe he is a straight shooter who does what he thinks is right in criminal cases without regard to the president 's preferences , and I suspect that is how he views himself . He does not want to go down in history as a political hack who did the White House 's bidding instead of doing his duty , who let the Justice Department become a vehicle for helping Trump 's friends and hurting his enemies . Barr 's interest in protecting his own reputation may be the department 's strongest shield against a president who seems genuinely puzzled by the idea that he should not use his power over the executive branch to dictate prosecutorial decisions .\nYet Barr chose to intervene in Stone 's case , a decision that would have hurt his reputation even if Trump had kept his mouth shut . According to Barr 's account in the ABC interview , Timothy Shea , a former Barr adviser whom he named the interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia on January 30 , `` came by to briefly chat with me '' about the Stone case on Monday . Shea told Barr the prosecutors assigned to the case `` very much wanted '' to recommend a seven-to-nine-year sentence , `` but he thought that there was a way of satisfying everybody and providing more flexibility . '' After that `` brief discussion , '' Barr said , `` I was under the impression that what was going to happen was very much what I had suggested , which is deferring to the judge and then pointing at various factors and circumstances . ''\nWhen Barr learned from news reports on Monday night that the prosecutors had filed a memorandum recommending the sentence they had originally favored , he said , `` I was very surprised .

But even assuming that 's true , the case of a longtime Trump crony who was convicted of trying to protect the president by lying to a congressional committee and tampering with a witness was obviously of strong personal interest to Barr 's boss . In case there was any doubt about that , Trump already had publicly commented on the case , complaining in November and again in January that Stone was being prosecuted for lying while various Trump foes had gotten away scot-free after committing what he viewed as similar offenses .

Apparently he did not communicate his decision clearly enough , because Shea let his prosecutors follow their initial inclination . And by Barr 's account , he knew he could not let that stand even before the president 's tweet .\n`` I have a problem with some of the tweets , '' Barr said . `` I 'm happy to say that in fact , the president has never asked me to do anything in a criminal case .
