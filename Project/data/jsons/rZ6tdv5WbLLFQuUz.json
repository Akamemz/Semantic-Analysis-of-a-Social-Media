    "content": "A federal appeals court on Wednesday ordered a lower court to allow the case against former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn to be dismissed , as requested by the Justice Department -- likely ending the years-long legal saga stemming from the Russia investigation .\nThe abrupt ending came in a 2-1 ruling and order from judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia .\nThis was the result of an appeal from Flynn 's lawyers asking for a so-called writ of mandamus -- essentially an order telling a government official to carry out a certain duty -- directing District Judge Emmet Sullivan to approve the DOJ 's motion to dismiss .\nSullivan did not immediately grant that motion and instead sought to hold hearings on the matter , angering Flynn allies .\nThe unusual move from Sullivan to keep the case alive despite prosecutors ' wishes was preceded by an unusual move from the DOJ itself to drop the charges against Flynn even after he had pleaded guilty -- saying the FBI interview that led to his charge of lying to investigators about his contacts with Russia 's ambassador had no `` legitimate investigative basis . ''\nIt 's unclear whether Sullivan could try to appeal to the full appeals court or even to the Supreme Court in order to keep the case alive . The next step otherwise would likely be for Sullivan to comply .\nWednesday 's court order was direct , ordering `` that Flynn \u2019 s petition for a writ of mandamus be granted in part ; the District Court is directed to grant the government \u2019 s ... motion to dismiss ; and the District Court \u2019 s order appointing an amicus is hereby vacated as moot , in accordance with the opinion of the court filed herein this date .
