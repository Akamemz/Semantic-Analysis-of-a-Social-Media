    "content": "The likely chairman of the House Judiciary Committee said Sunday that it would be an impeachable offense if President Trump is found to be complicit in a felony .\nRep. Jerrold Nadler made the remarks after federal prosecutors connected Mr. Trump to illicit hush-money payments allegedly made on his behalf to silence women who say they had sexual relationships with the president before the 2016 campaign .\nStill , the New York Democrat and other critics of the president said Congress isn \u2019 t to the point of initiating impeachment proceedings , which would begin in Mr. Nadler \u2019 s committee .\nMr. Nadler said there are still questions that need answers .\n\u201c Whether they are important enough to justify an impeachment is a different question , but certainly they \u2019 d be impeachable offenses , \u201d Mr. Nadler said on CNN \u2019 s \u201c State of the Union . \u201d\nEven if any crimes were committed before the president took office , Mr. Nadler said , they could rise to the level of impeachment if they were in the service of \u201c fraudulently obtaining \u201d the office .\nFederal prosecutors said in court papers filed late last week that Michael Cohen , the president \u2019 s former attorney and fixer , admitted to prosecutors that the hush payments to two women who claimed they had affairs with Mr. Trump were made with the coordination and direction of \u201c Individual-1 , \u201d a moniker assigned to Mr. Trump in earlier court filings .\nMr. Cohen pleaded guilty in August to multiple federal crimes , including making false statements , bank fraud , and campaign finance violations for arranging the payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal .\nMr. Trump has denied having sexual relationships with either woman and over the weekend denied directing Mr. Cohen to break any laws .\nRep. Adam B. Schiff , the top Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , likewise said lawmakers need to see the \u201c full picture \u201d before they determine whether or not to move ahead with impeachment proceedings .\n\u201c Now the question that \u2019 s presented just by Michael Cohen \u2019 s plea and the Justice Department filing : Is a crime directed and coordinated by the president which helped him obtain office sufficient to warrant his removal from that office ? \u201d Mr. Schiff said on CBS \u2019 s \u201c Face the Nation . \u201c That \u2019 s a legitimate question to ask . \u201d\nSen. Angus S.

The unidentified individual told Mr. Cohen he could secure Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2019 s approval for the project .\nThe person offered to arrange a meeting with Mr. Putin , saying it could have a \u201c phenomenal impact \u201d on the campaign and on Mr. Trump \u2019 s business interests .\nMr. Cohen did not follow up with the individual , according to court filings . But the revelation is significant because it shows that Russia may have made overtures to the Trump campaign earlier than originally known .\nMr. Trump said over the weekend that there is nothing in the recent filings that show he colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 campaign .\n\u201c On the Mueller situation , we are very happy with what we are reading because there was no collusion whatsoever \u2014 there never has been , \u201d the president told reporters . \u201c The last thing I want is help from Russia on a campaign . \u201d\nMr. Cohen said in a letter to Congress that the Trump Tower Moscow project was abandoned by January 2016 and he had not spoken with Russian officials about it . However , the project was still moving forward in June 2016 , and Mr. Trump even considered traveling to Russia after the Republican National Convention to keep it alive , according to court documents .\nThose same court documents also revealed Mr. Cohen discussed the project with Mr. Trump and members of his family .\n\u201c At a time during the campaign when Donald Trump was the presumptive Republican nominee and he was telling the country he has no dealings with Russia , in fact they were having private conversations seeking to enlist the Kremlin \u2019 s help in a project that could make him tens or hundreds of millions of dollars , a project that might need Putin \u2019 s approval while they were arguing that sanctions on Russia should go away , \u201d Mr. Schiff said .\nAttorneys for Mr. Cohen had sought leniency , arguing that he had cooperated with Mr. Mueller \u2019 s investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia .
