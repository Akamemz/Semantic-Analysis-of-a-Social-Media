Then , without a murmur of democratic dissent , David Cameron \u2019 s successor as prime minister , Theresa May , was appointed by a hereditary monarch , without even a run-off against her main rival ( the self-destructing Andrea Leadsom ) , or a single vote cast by the 150,000 members of May \u2019 s Conservative party\u2014let alone a general election .\nIf the British people are prepared to go along with a fix that appears nearly as democratic as something out of the Soviet Union , you may wonder what the fuss over Brexit was all about in the first place . It now appears that the British apply democratic standards only when it is convenient to the governing class , which , by the way , includes all of those conservative politicians who argued so passionately that we must take back control of our country , and democracy , for the people \u2019 s sake . May has no mandate and little moral legitimacy to lead the nation after this crisis , but that seems to bother no one . The truth is that the right generally prefers order over principle , and British conservatives are no exception . Their present hypocrisy is world class .\nBut are they any worse than the Labour party , which seems to favor democratic process over order ? Two nondescript Labour M.P.s , Angela Eagle and Owen Smith , who don \u2019 t score highly on any agreed metric of charisma , have subsequently challenged__ Jeremy Corbyn \u2019 s__ leadership , which will result in a contest that will persist until the end of September . So , at the very moment when parliament is due to decide how and when the United Kingdom departs the European Union , the opposition has gone into a closed therapy session , rendering the U.K. little better than a one-party state . There will be no one to argue against any premature triggering of Article 50 , which will initiate the unstoppable process of leaving the E.U. , and no leader to represent the interests and anxieties of the 48 percent of people who voted to remain .\nTo watch this crash in slow motion , and at close quarters , is incredibly depressing . I have found people who voted for the Brexit and now regret the decision , but I have yet to meet one Remainer who is anything but appalled by the spiral of chaos that has followed the vote to leave\u2014a shock that has led to a grim hangover in which no one is quite sure what Brexit actually is . As the veteran conservative politician Ken Clarke said during Cameron \u2019 s final and good-natured Question Time in the House of Commons , \u201c No two people can agree on what Brexit means . \u201d\nThat observation may offer a space in which May can operate , but few have an idea what she is really like . Is she Britain \u2019 s answer to Angela Merkel , or rather a politician who has merely risen to the top without proper scrutiny ? She now reminds me less of Cruella De Vil , which I suggested last week , than one of those severe characters in English novels , who mysteriously appear in the life of a household as a tutor or housekeeper and then take complete control of all the other characters . May has a tone of correction in her voice , absolutely no interest in small talk and , once she has made up her mind , does not back down . Since the Labour Party is un-electable , she could easily be prime minister for four or more years . And , of course , if Hillary Clinton beats Donald Trump in November , she may join Merkel and Clinton as a historic troika of women leading the West .",
