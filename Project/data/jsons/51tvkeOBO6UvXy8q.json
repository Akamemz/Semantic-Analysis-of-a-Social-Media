That means he is on pace to spend a record amount on digital ads , according to ad spending experts .\nThe campaign for Mitt Romney , who survived a heated primary race to become the presumptive Republican nominee , spent $ 7.8 million for online ads this year , in addition to the $ 500,000 it spent in 2011 . The numbers are compiled by the Federal Elections Commission from reports by the campaigns .\nZac Moffat , digital director for Romney 's campaign , predicted online ad spending would pick up for both camps as the general election contest kicks into high gear .\n`` We plan to do a ton more now that the primaries are over , '' he said . The Obama campaign wo n't comment on its digital strategy .\nMoffat said that while TV ads are like hitting voters over the head with a hammer , Internet ads are more like using a scalpel .\nWhen it comes to reaching specific voters , Moffat said , `` you can be a lot more precise with your message online .

The campaigns buy ad space on sites such as elNuevoHerald.com to reach Latino groups and SuburbanChicagoNews.com to find the Catholics who could vote either way , and look for independents on general news sites such as CNN or e-mail sites such as Yahoo !\nMoffat also noted that Romney 's campaign , like Obama 's , has posted multiple videos to Hulu and YouTube to reach people who do n't watch TV much . There 's another strong advantage to online video ads : You generally ca n't fast -forward through them like you can if you use a DVR to watch TV .\nBoth campaigns have already spent millions on TV ads .

The site had more than 5 million Romney ad impressions between January and April . His ads also ran on local news sites such as TheState.com in South Carolina and OrlandoSentinel.com in Florida .\nBy comparison , Obama 's campaign spent the most at Comcast.net , paying more than $ 1 million for ads that have appeared on the site more than 238 million times .
