The group did not respond to a CNN request for comment .\nThe Trump campaign seized at the new batch of emails , citing them as evidence of Clinton being corrupt . The prolonged investigations into her use of a private email server while at the State Department has fueled public distrust of her and plagued her presidential bid . But the Justice Department declined to press charges against Clinton for her handling of classified information related to the server earlier this year , with FBI Director James Comey saying while she was `` extremely careless , '' it was his judgment that `` no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case .
