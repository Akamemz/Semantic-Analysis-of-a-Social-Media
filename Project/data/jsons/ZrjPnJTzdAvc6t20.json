Tillerson , speaking to reporters \u200b\u200bin Beijing on Thursday as Mr. Trump wrapped up two days of talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping , said a meeting with Mr. Putin requires \u201c substantive \u201d topics \u200b\u200bto discuss .\n\u201c We have been in contact with them , and the view has been if the two leaders are going to meet , is there something sufficiently substantive to talk about that would warrant a formal meeting , \u201d Mr. Tillerson said . \u201c There \u2019 s been no conclusion made on that.\u200b \u201d \u200b\nBoth leaders are attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit , and Mr. Tillerson said it \u201c wouldn \u2019 t be at all unusual if they ended up with some kind of a pull-aside . \u201d\nMr. Trump has said he wants Mr. Putin \u2019 s help in pressuring North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons and missile programs , a crisis for which China had no clear answers this week .\nMr. Tillerson said other possible topics for Mr. Putin include finding a solution to the war in Syria , eradicating the Islamic State terrorists in the Middle East and addressing Russia \u2019 s military incursion in Ukraine .\nAsked about Moscow \u2019 s meddling in the 2016 presidential election , Mr. Tillerson said : \u201c It stays on that list . \u201d\nA Kremlin spokesman said Mr. Putin likely will meet with Mr. Trump , but there is \u201c no agreed agenda . \u201d\nThe two leaders met face-to-face meeting for the first time in July at a summit in Germany , where Mr. Putin disavowed Russian interference in the election .\nBefore leaving China , Mr. Trump toned down his criticism of Beijing , saying China isn \u2019 t to blame for the mammoth trade imbalance with the U.S . He expressed the hope that Mr. Xi will \u201c work hard \u201d to reduce tensions with North Korea .\nMr. Trump said the \u201c very one-sided and unfair \u201d trade relationship between the U.S. and China is actually the fault of his predecessors in Washington . He called Mr. Xi \u201c a very special man . \u201d\n\u201c I don \u2019 t blame China , \u201d Mr. Trump said . \u201c After all , who can blame a country for being able to take advantage of another country for the benefit of its citizens ? I give China great credit . \u201d\nHe told Chinese and U.S. business leaders at an event , \u201c I do blame past [ U.S. ] administrations for allowing this out-of-control trade deficit to take place and to grow . We have to fix this because it just doesn \u2019 t work for our great American companies , and it doesn \u2019 t work for our great American workers . It is just not sustainable . \u201d\nMr. Trump later clarified on Twitter , \u201c I don \u2019 t blame China , I blame the incompetence of past Admins for allowing China to take advantage of the U.S. on trade leading up to a point where the U.S. is losing $ 100 \u2019 s of billions . How can you blame China for taking advantage of people that had no clue ?
