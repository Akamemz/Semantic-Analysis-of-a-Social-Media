At every level , across both parties , the media , pollsters \u2014 all the democratic institutions that are supposed to prevent something like this from happening or at least warn us about it . Donald Trump , a Republican candidate who ran an openly racist campaign , who is as proud a misogynist as you \u2019 ll find anywhere , who is manifestly ignorant of public policy , who is brusquely authoritarian , who has little respect or understanding of democratic norms and who embodies every moral failing that \u2019 s supposed to disqualify a candidate from higher office , has apparently been elected as the next president of the United States .\nThe markets are collapsing , the globe is reeling , and nobody can quite explain what the hell happened . But here \u2019 s what this failure will mean : The climate , which is warming precipitously , is now guaranteed to continue along that trajectory toward global catastrophe . The millions of people who gained health coverage over the last half of a decade are now at acute risk of being thrown off their insurance plan and left to the unfeeling mercies of insurance underwriters .\nIncome inequality , already at dangerously high levels , will only grow worse as tax cuts for the rich and spending cuts for the poor are pushed through the Republican Congress . Unprecedented GOP obstructionism on Supreme Court nominees has been rewarded in the worst possible way . And the foreign policy of the United States will be run by a bona fide ignoramus .\nThe man elected to the most powerful office in the land has no idea what to do with it and no concept of its limitations . He attracts the worst people to him , sycophants and power-hungry strivers who will be placed in positions of authority and who will obey the boss \u2019 diktat above anything else . Every democratic norm he gleefully shredded along the way is gone for good . Every thumb in the eye of transparency will now be official policy .\nBut right now those things are not what I think about when I contemplate life under President Donald Trump . This will sound trite , but primarily I think about my two boys , a 2-year-old and a 4-month-old . I don \u2019 t have to explain this to them because neither would understand . But if I were to tell my 2-year-old what is happening , I \u2019 d do it in Spanish because both he and his brother have deep Mexican roots that my wife and I want them to embrace and be proud of . It destroys me to know that they , that we live in a country that seems to have chosen as its leader a person who made frenzied racial attacks on my family \u2019 s heritage the launch pad for his successful presidential run .\nI think about the African-Americans , Muslims , Jews , and Latinos in this country who now face life in a country presided over by a candidate who embodies white nationalism and memorably couldn \u2019 t bring himself to disavow a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan . Children of undocumented immigrants who are U.S. citizens by birth have been told by their new president that they \u2019 ll be deported . Refugees from Syria who were relocated here to escape war and violence will have another target on their backs . These are the people who will feel the consequences of this failure most acutely .\nI have one more thing to add : I am sorry .\nIn my capacity as a media figure , I too often treated Trump as a joke , a bumbling incompetent , someone who obviously could not be treated seriously as a legitimate candidate for the presidency . Now I can only think that I was too hidebound by conventional wisdom , too comfortably out of touch to see what was in front of me . I succumbed to the sideshow element of this awful race more times than I can be comfortable with . I own this failure , too .",
