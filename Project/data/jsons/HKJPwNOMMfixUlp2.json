( Neil Hall/Reuters )\nUnchallenged , a British judge \u2019 s decision could mean that countless others lose their jobs for stating the obvious .\nTwitter has exploded in outrage because J. K. Rowling , author of the Harry Potter books , is an alleged \u201c TERF. \u201d That \u2019 s right , a \u201c trans-exclusionary radical feminist. \u201d This ridiculous slur was invented by people who insist on denying the science of sex and who want to take out their rage on nonbelievers , and on dissenting women in particular .\nProminent male transgender activists such as Charlotte Clymer have gone full hysterical . \u201c For several years , there has been substantial concern that J.K. Rowling is transphobic , \u201d Clymer tweeted , referring , I presume , to the time Rowling followed the women \u2019 s rights campaigner Magdalen Berns on Twitter . \u201c I admit that I held out that one of my childhood heroes was simply being misunderstood . This morning , that was dashed when she defended a researcher who was fired for transphobic tweets . \u201d\n\u201c As a gay man that found safety in Hogwarts throughout my childhood , \u201d tweeted Shamir Sanni . \u201c Knowing that Trans people wouldn \u2019 t be able to have that safety breaks my heart. \u201d Does Mr. Sanni realize that Hogwarts isn \u2019 t real ?\nTo those of us who have been following the steady erosion of women \u2019 s rights , child safeguarding , and medical science , Rowling \u2019 s intervention was very welcome . Here is what she said :\nBut force women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real ? # IStandWithMaya # ThisIsNotADrill \u2014 J.K. Rowling ( @ jk_rowling ) December 19 , 2019\nAs for what she is referring to , it is merely the latest in the transgender war on employment rights .\nIn October , I wrote about a doctor who was sacked for his disbelief in transgenderism . David Mackereth M.D . had worked for nearly 30 years for the British National Health Service without attracting a single complaint . But when he signaled at a training session , after being confronted with a hypothetical scenario , that he felt unable to disregard his belief in the immutability of sex , he was dismissed .\nLater , a British employment judge ruled that his employer \u2019 s decision was fair because Mackereth \u2019 s belief that a person can not become the opposite sex was \u201c incompatible with human dignity. \u201d This week , another employment judge made an almost identical ruling in relation to Maya Forstater , a tax expert who lost her job for expressing this same belief in various tweets .\nAs with Mackereth , Forstater was hoping to defend her right to express her beliefs by using the U.K. \u2019 s anti-discrimination law , the Equality Act of 2010 . This law was intended to prevent discrimination on the basis of a range of characteristics including \u201c belief. \u201d As I explained at the time :\nThe legal precedent for a case like this , as referred to throughout the judgment , comes from Grainger v. Nicholson , argued in 2010 . In Grainger , Nicholson \u2019 s lawyers successfully argued that his belief in climate change was a philosophical position worthy of protection under the \u201c religion or belief \u201d clause of the Equality Act . Nicholson \u2019 s environmentalism was then used to establish the following criteria for the category of \u201c belief \u201d : That it be \u201c genuinely held . \u201d\nThat it be a belief and not an opinion or viewpoint ( e.g. , this or that political affiliation or preference ) .\nThat it be concerning \u201c a weighty and substantial aspect of human life and behavior . \u201d\nThat it have \u201c a certain level of cogency , seriousness , cohesion and importance . \u201d\nThat it be \u201c worthy of respect in a democratic society [ and ] be not incompatible with human dignity and not conflict with the fundamental rights of others \u201d ( emphasis added ) .\nForstater \u2019 s belief , on trial , was simply that \u201c \u2018 sex \u2019 is a material reality which should not be conflated with \u2018 gender \u2019 or \u2018 gender identity. \u2019 \u201d Further , that \u201c being female is an immutable biological fact , not a feeling or an identity . Moreover , sex matters . It is important to be able to talk about and take action against the discrimination , violence and oppression that still affect women and girls because they were born female . \u201d\nThe legal question is whether this belief \u2014 or her lack of belief in transgenderism : \u201c that everyone has an inner \u2018 gender \u2019 which may be the same as or different to their sex at birth , and that gender effectively trumps sex , so that \u2018 trans men are men \u2019 and \u2018 trans women are women \u2019 \u201d \u2014 amounts to a philosophical belief as defined and protected by the Equality Act of 2010 .\nForstater explains that the reason for her involvement in the gender debate was that \u201c she first became concerned about proposed changes to the Gender Recognition Act 2004 in 2017 because of proposals for a move to permitting people to self-identify their gender. \u201d After a year of researching and formulating her view , she began tweeting about it in August 2018 . Some of those tweets included :\n\u201c UK gov consultation on reforming the GenderRecognitionAct \u2013 proposes to dramatically change scope of the law ; from requiring medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria for change of sex on birth certificate , to using the basis of \u2018 self identification \u2019 \u2026 \u201d\n\u201c I share the concerns of @ fairplaywomen that radically expanding the legal definition of \u2018 women \u2019 so that it can include both males and females makes it a meaningless concept , and will undermine women \u2019 s rights & protections for vulnerable women & girls . \u2026 \u201d\n\u201c Some transgender people have cosmetic surgery . But most retain their birth genitals . Everyone \u2019 s equality and safety should be protected , but women and girls lose out on privacy , safety and fairness if males are allowed into changing rooms , dormitories , prisons , sports teams . \u201d\nThe judge also notes that Forstater had shown support for \u201c campaigns where the definition \u2018 woman , w\u028am\u0259n , noun , adult human female \u2019 is put on billboards , projected onto buildings and printed on T shirts. \u201d Just imagine !\nThe judge highlighted that Forstater had explained to her employers in October 2018 :\nI have been told that it is offensive to say \u201c transwomen are men \u201d or that women means \u201c adult human female \u201d .
