    "content": "Let \u2019 s be clear about what happened here . The American Health Care Act failed because it was a terrible piece of legislation . It would have thrown 24 million people off insurance and raised deductibles for millions more \u2014 and the savings would \u2019 ve gone to pay for tax cuts for millionaires . It broke virtually all of Donald Trump \u2019 s campaign promises , and was opposed not just by Democrats but also by Republicans .\nHere , for instance , is what Michael Needham , head of the very conservative Heritage Action , wrote : \u201c It is an awful bill that will impact millions of Americans \u2019 lives and is opposed by nearly every serious conservative health care analyst . This legislation is a policy , process , and political disaster . \u201d\nOr take the statement released by Rep. Mo Brooks , a conservative Republican from Alabama . `` I will vote against the American Health Care Act because it has more bad policy than any bill I have ever faced , \u201d he said .\nOr take David Brooks \u2019 s Friday column . `` This bill takes the most vicious progressive stereotypes about conservatives and validates them , \u201d he wrote .\nThis is a failure for Speaker Paul Ryan on many levels . He wrote this bill , and when the speaker takes over the process like that , the upside is it \u2019 s supposed to create legislation that can pass . On this most basic task , Ryan failed , and failed spectacularly .\nSome legislation fails even though the party faithful love it . For the Democrats , the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill was like that \u2014 it went nowhere in the Senate , but liberals appreciated that Nancy Pelosi tried . The American Health Care Act wasn \u2019 t like that . Republicans were glad to see it die .\nBut beyond the legislative and tactical deficiencies , the AHCA reflected a deeper failure of moral and policy imagination . Ryan spent the latter half of Barack Obama \u2019 s presidency promising to repair the Republican Party \u2019 s relationship with the poor ( remember Ryan \u2019 s \u201c poverty tour \u201d ? ) . He \u2019 s spent every day since the passage of Obamacare saying the Republicans could do better . This is what he came up with ? The GOP put their greatest policy mind in charge of the House of Representatives and they got ... this ?\nDoes Donald Trump have the patience to work with Congress ?\nThroughout the AHCA \u2019 s short life , the limits of Donald Trump \u2019 s attention span were on sharp display . He never bothered to learn enough about the AHCA to make a persuasive case for it , which is part of the reason it failed . But perhaps more tellingly , he seemed exhausted by what was , in ordinary political terms , an incredibly fast legislative process . The bill is less than 20 days old , but Trump is already telling reporters , `` It 's enough already. \u201d That \u2019 s what you say after working on health reform for years , not days .\nObama dedicated 13 months to passing Obamacare .

Of course , neither Trump nor Ryan nor anyone else ever tried to get a Democratic vote . They didn \u2019 t meet with Democrats , and from the beginning , they used the reconciliation process precisely because it meant they wouldn \u2019 t have to deal with Democrats . Trump is going to have a very frustrating presidency if his strategy is to not try to get the Democratic votes he needs and then complain when his priorities don \u2019 t pass .\n`` You gave us absolute power but the mean minority party wo n't fix things '' may be the lamest political messaging I 've ever heard . \u2014 Dave Weigel ( @ daveweigel ) March 24 , 2017\nTrump \u2019 s new approach appears to be telling the country Obamacare is set to \u201c explode \u201d and , once that happens , Democrats will want to deal .
