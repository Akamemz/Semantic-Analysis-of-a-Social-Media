''\nThe House also voted to extend the length of the funding resolution by one month from Nov. 15 to Dec. 15 , and included a controversial `` conscience clause '' that would delay a requirement under the health care law that employers provide health insurance that covers contraceptives for women .\nHouse Republicans expressed confidence that the latest strategy could hold more promise in the Senate than their original effort to defund the health care law . `` I think there are some senators over there who may be in cycle that secretly want a one-year delay and we just got to find the right mix that enables them to justify that vote , '' said Rep.
