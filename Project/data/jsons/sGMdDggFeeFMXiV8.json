According to a senior administration official , the plan includes a provision to lower cost-of-living adjustments to Social Security , the benefit program for retirees . This would curb the growth in benefits .\nThe administration made clear that it is offering changes to Social Security and Medicare -- the two benefit programs most important to seniors -- in order to convince Republicans to accept increased revenues . The official said the plan to be unveiled next week `` is n't a menu of options for them to choose from -- it 's a cohesive package . ''\nBut Boehner bristled at the demand , noting that the president and his party already extracted tax increases on top earners as part of the deal to avert the fiscal crisis at the end of 2012 .\n`` In the end , the president got his tax hikes on the wealthy with no corresponding spending cuts .
