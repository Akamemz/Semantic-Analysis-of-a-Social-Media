Last year , Trump said Manafort had only been with the campaign for a \u201c very short period of time \u201d . The book also contradicts Spicer \u2019 s own March 2017 statement at the White House that Manafort had \u201c played a very limited role for a very limited amount of time \u201d .\nBut in the book Spicer portrays Manafort as having an important and impactful role .\n\u201c Paul brought a much-needed maturity to the Trump campaign when it needed an experienced political professional operative more than anything else , \u201d Spicer writes of Manafort \u2019 s hiring in the spring of 2016 . \u201c There was no semblance of a campaign structure , just a few , distraught , overworked people constantly barking into their phones . Paul immediately set up and staffed the political and communications operations necessary to take on the Clinton machine .\n\u201c The Manafort message was clear : Trump will be our nominee and our next president , and anyone who didn \u2019 t want to work to that end could spend the next four years in political Siberia . ( No Russia pun intended . ) \u201d\nManafort resigned as Trump campaign chairman in August 2016 , after the national spotlight focused on undeclared payments that he had received for work in the former Soviet bloc . He was jailed last month as he awaits trial on charges of money laundering , tax fraud , failure to register as a foreign agent and obstruction of justice . Manafort has denied all wrongdoing .\nElsewhere in the book , the reader finds out what really was happening behind the scenes when Spicer , now an unpaid Fox News guest with a podcast and an Instagram , attacked the press for pointing out the small size of Trump \u2019 s inauguration day crowd ; when Spicer first saw Melissa McCarthy \u2019 s impression of him on Saturday Night Live ; when Spicer denied that Adolf Hitler used chemical weapons ; when Anthony Scaramucci was appointed as Spicer \u2019 s boss ; when Spicer was excluded from a papal audience ; when Spicer allegedly hid in the White House bushes on the night of James Comey \u2019 s firing ( didn \u2019 t happen , Spicer says ) ; and when Trump \u2019 s Access Hollywood \u201c Grab \u2019 em by the pussy \u201d tape emerged .\n\u201c I was surprised by how many women who contacted me did not consider Trump \u2019 s comments a big deal , \u201d Spicer writes of the latter episode . \u201c One prominent Republican woman told me , \u2018 You all talk like this ; we know it. \u2019 ( Actually , we men don \u2019 t all talk like this , but I held my tongue . ) \u201d\nSpicer , whose six-month stint as White House press secretary lasted only one month longer than Manafort \u2019 s job with the Trump campaign , loads his memoir with painstakingly thorough descriptions of his own intensively incremental career calculations .\n\u201c I had talked to White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and chief strategist Steve Bannon about me stepping away from the podium and taking a more strategic role , \u201d Spicer writes at one stage , \u201c which I thought better suited my talents . \u201d\nBut Spicer \u2019 s admiration for Trump shines through all of his reflections on the frustrations of the job . While Spicer in one passage applies the words \u201c erratic \u201d and \u201c mercurial \u201d to the president , the book \u2013 which begins with a scene of Trump determinedly refusing Spicer \u2019 s resignation \u2013 is filled with emotionally charged passages starring the president . ( The book also includes an eloquent passage in which Spicer writes about the tragic loss of his father to cancer during the presidential transition . )\nAfter what he judged to be a particularly strong early outing as press secretary , Spicer rushes back to where Trump has been watching on television .\n\u201c To my eternal surprise , he rose up and gave me a bear hug , \u201d Spicer writes . \u201c \u2018 That \u2019 s my Sean .
