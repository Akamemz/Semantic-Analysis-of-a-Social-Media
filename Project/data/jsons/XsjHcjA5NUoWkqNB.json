    "content": "The WNBA and the players ' union have come to tentative terms on a new collective bargaining agreement that includes a significant salary bump for the league 's highest-paid players , going from an annual base salary of $ 117,500 to $ 215,000 .\nThe new CBA also includes other cash compensation increases , changes to free agency , travel improvements , additional motherhood and family-planning benefits , enhanced marketing and career-development opportunities , and changes to revenue-sharing potential .\n`` We believe it 's a groundbreaking and historic deal , '' WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert said . `` I 'm proud of the players ; they bargained hard , they unified , they brought attention to so many important topics . ''\nHighlights of WNBA CBA \u2022 Annual base pay for league 's highest-paid player jumps from $ 117,500 to $ 215,000 . \u2022 With other benefits , the league 's top players could earn cash compensation in excess of $ 500,000 . \u2022 The agreement is for eight years , from the 2020 through 2027 seasons with a mutual opt-out provision after six years . \u2022 2020 salary cap will be $ 1.3 million , up from $ 996,100 in 2019 . \u2022 Players who complete their contracts and have five or more years of service can become unrestricted free agents , unless they are tagged as a `` core '' player . \u2022 The number of times a player can be tagged as `` core '' goes from four to three beginning this season , and drops to two beginning with the 2022 season . \u2022 Players will receive full salary while on maternity leave , an annual child care stipend of $ 5,000 , and guarantee of two-bedroom apartments for players with children .\nThe agreement is for eight years , from the 2020 through 2027 seasons , with a mutual opt-out provision after six years . Those were the same terms as for the previous agreement in 2014 , and the players voted in 2018 to opt out after the 2019 season , which set the stage for this agreement .\nTerri Jackson , executive director of the Women 's National Basketball Players Association , said having the eight-year deal again gave the players the sense of a strong long-term commitment from the league .\nThis will be the fifth CBA in the history of the WNBA , which launched in 1997 . The first CBA was in 1999 , and agreements followed in 2003 , 2008 and 2014 .\nAll salary figures have not been released yet , but the text of the new CBA is expected to be made public soon . It was announced Tuesday on a conference call that the players had `` overwhelmingly '' ratified the agreement via a vote . The CBA is still pending ratification by the league 's Board of Governors , but that is expected .\nThe high maximum salary for 2020 will have a significant bump , going from $ 117,500 to $ 215,000 , and the 2020 salary cap will be $ 1.3 million , up from $ 996,100 in 2019 . The finalized agreement will have salary and salary cap figures for the eight-year period ; Engelbert said on the conference call that the cap will increase 3 percent yearly .\nThe league said there will be a 53 % increase in total cash compensation , separate from insurance benefits , housing , per diems , etc . Cash compensation consists of base salary , additional performance bonuses , prize pools for newly created in-season competitions , and league and team marketing deals .\nThat means the league 's top players could earn cash compensation in excess of $ 500,000 , which would more than triple the prior maximum compensation . Other top players have the chance to earn between $ 200,000 and $ 300,000 . The average cash compensation will be nearly $ 130,000 .\nThe additional cash pool breaks down as a minimum of $ 1.6 million in offseason marketing agreements . The in-season competitions will including something called the Commissioner 's Cup , which will be further detailed when the league announces its 2020 schedule later this week .\n`` We will designate Cup games the first half of the season leading into the Olympic break this year , '' Engelbert explained . `` And then [ for ] the two teams with the best records , we will have a final in August as our first game back to re-launch the season . In 2020 , the cash prizes will be more moderate , but in 2021 , we 're going to step them up as we seek sponsors . ''\nAs for revenue sharing , starting in 2021 , there will be a chance for a 50-50 split between players and the league , based on the achievement of revenue growth targets from broadcast agreements , marketing partnerships and licensing deals . Past revenue sharing was tied to ticket sales and provided only about a 20 % option for the players -- but according to the union , it was n't triggered because the specified goals were n't met . This revenue-sharing plan , the union believes , has a more realistic chance of benefiting the players .\nRegarding free agency , which was first introduced in the 2003 CBA , changes in the new deal should allow for the potential of more player movement , starting in the free-agency period before the 2021 season .\nPlayers then will be eligible for unrestricted free agency one year earlier than in the prior CBA . Those who complete their contracts and have five or more years of service can become unrestricted free agents , unless they are tagged as a `` core '' player . But part of the core designation is also changing : The number of times a player can have the core designation goes from four to three beginning this season , and drops to two beginning with the 2022 season .\n`` Frankly , the core is not necessarily the most popular part of the CBA , '' said WNBPA executive committee president Nneka Ogwumike of the Los Angeles Sparks . `` But we wanted to ensure that core is still reflective of what our system supports , while also ensuring our players have a little more freedom .\n`` I do understand the value of franchise players . We see the power that 's held by our brethren in the NBA , in terms of players having almost complete control of their movement . But we get that the WNBA is the WNBA . So for us to have some of both sides of that , it 's going to be helpful from all perspectives . ''\nAnother primary objective of the union was to improve what was termed `` quality of life '' issues , including travel , which has long been a concern of players . In general , charter flights are not a financially feasible option , although the league did allow for charter consideration in the playoffs last year . But under the new CBA , premium economy class status is guaranteed for all players during the regular season . Also , each player will get a hotel room , rather than some players sharing rooms .\n`` Those things may seem small to some people , but with the nature of our job , those things really matter , '' Ogwumike said . `` Those things do impact performance . You have more comfort on flights , and with your own room you 're not worried about waking your teammate or interfering with their sleep patterns . ''\nBetter maternity benefits also were negotiated , including players receiving full salary while on maternity leave , an annual child care stipend of $ 5,000 , and guarantee of two-bedroom apartments for players with children . There are also family-planning benefits that reimburse up to $ 60,000 in expenses for veteran players regarding fees for adoption , surrogacy , oocyte cryopreservation ( freezing eggs for later use ) or fertility treatments .\nThe CBA allows for increased pathways to career opportunities for players after their playing careers , improved mental health benefits and resources , and counseling and education concerning intimate partner violence .\nLike Engelbert , Jackson praised the executive committee and players ' increased involvement across the board in the negotiating process .\n`` Getting the travel improved , getting the improvements for mothers , getting to where we can say a top player in this league could have her salary nearly double -- I think those are really good things , '' Jackson said . `` I feel we 'll see the players be more visible year-round . There are things we asked of the league , and things they asked of the players . And we got there .
