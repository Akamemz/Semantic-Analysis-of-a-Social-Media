They \u2019 re wrong .\nThe Republican nominee \u2014 three months after clinching the nomination \u2014 has begun frantically trying to reposition himself in the past week , installing a new campaign manager and controversial CEO to help him escape the straitjacket that his 14 months of incendiary comments and hard-edged policy positions have him in .\nHis task , GOP insiders readily concede , seems close to impossible . In an interview Wednesday night , Trump \u2019 s new campaign manager , Kellyanne Conway , recognized how long it may take to improve the public \u2019 s negative perceptions of the GOP nominee , likening her turnaround project to turning a tanker .\nTrump may not have that kind of time . Early voting begins in 26 days in Minnesota and in 32 other states soon after that . And already , as summer inches to its end , 90 percent of Americans say they \u2019 ve decided . For all the televised daily drama this race has provided , the final outcome itself is shaping up to be less dramatic than any presidential election since 1984 .\n\u201c Kellyanne is good at this , but she \u2019 s got a very damaged candidate and it \u2019 s very late in the game , \u201d said Tony Fratto , a GOP operative in Washington and former deputy press secretary to President George W. Bush . \u201c I think it \u2019 s too late , in fact . I don \u2019 t believe he can change . All of this is trying to trick voters into thinking there is a better Donald Trump out there . There is no better Donald Trump . \u201d\nAlthough Trump has been seemingly slow to realize it , the more than $ 2 billion in free media he rode to the GOP nomination was simultaneously hardening the broader country \u2019 s negative view of Trump just as it was endearing him to the conservative base . The cascade of Trump-created controversies following the conventions that precipitated Conway \u2019 s hiring appear to have irrevocably damaged his credibility as a plausible commander in chief and could prove to be the turning point in the general election itself .\n\u201c It was a terribly damaging period , \u201d said Steve Schmidt , the GOP strategist who guided John McCain \u2019 s 2008 campaign . \u201c It hit on his trust numbers , his fitness for office \u2014 and at a time when [ Hillary Clinton ] \u2019 s had some hard news cycles . In any normal cycle , she \u2019 s the de-facto incumbent and these stories would have her on defense ; and she \u2019 s not on defense , so there \u2019 s an opportunity cost to all this . \u201d\nMore than 60 percent of Americans have an unfavorable opinion of Trump , leaving Clinton , with a 54 percent unfavorable rating , as only the second most unpopular presidential candidate in history . Both candidates , in fact , have held unfavorable ratings above 50 percent since launching their respective campaigns , with Trump hovering around the 60 percent mark , only a few points above Clinton . Asked to name a smell they might associate with this election , participants in a focus group conducted by Peter Hart in Wisconsin last week gave the following responses : \u201c sulfur , \u201d \u201c rotten eggs , \u201d `` garbage , \u201d \u201c manure \u201d and a \u201c skunk \u2019 s fart . \u201d\nBarring any unforeseen revelations about Clinton , the next 70 days likely aren \u2019 t going to change people \u2019 s view of either presidential contender . According to a national survey released Thursday by Quinnipiac University , 90 percent of likely voters have already made up their mind about the presidential race and are unlikely to change .\n`` We are starting to hear the faint rumblings of a Hillary Clinton landslide as her 10-point lead is further proof that Donald Trump is in a downward spiral as the clock ticks , '' said Tim Malloy , assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll . `` Trump 's missteps , stumbles and gaffes seem to outweigh Clinton 's shaky trust status and perceived shady dealings . \u201d\nWith the electoral map tipping so sharply in Clinton \u2019 s favor in the weeks following the two party conventions ( her lead has widened beyond the margin of error in seven of 11 swing states ) , Trump \u2019 s new team is scrambling to stay afloat even with his robust campaign regimen that has him doing four times as many events as Clinton . Recent efforts to muddle the GOP nominee \u2019 s hard-line positions on immigration \u2014 catnip for conservative primary voters but repellent to many general election swing voters \u2014 and to couch them in softer language are part of an eleventh-hour effort to broaden his narrow appeal beyond older , mostly white men . Trump \u2019 s direct overtures to Hispanic and African-American voters last week were made with the same purpose .\nJeb Bush , whose more moderate immigration positions Trump blasted as \u201c amnesty \u201d during the GOP primary and now appears to be adopting himself , was blunt in an interview Thursday with Rita Cosby of WABC Radio , calling Trump \u2019 s new rhetoric \u201c abhorrent . \u201d\n\u201c I don \u2019 t know what to believe about a guy who doesn \u2019 t believe in things , \u201d Bush said .\nIn New Hampshire on Thursday , Trump again sketched a grim portrait of America \u2019 s minority communities before asking African-American and Hispanic voters to support him . \u201c What the hell do you have to lose ? \u201d he asked .\nBut with Trump pulling in just 1 percent of African-American voters in Pennsylvania , many political observers view the sinking candidate \u2014 and his Hail Mary attempt \u2014 as the one with little left to lose .\n\u201c Minority outreach is an example of a campaign addressing a fake issue and not a real issue , which is Donald Trump \u2019 s character , \u201d said Drew Cline , a GOP operative in Bedford . \u201c It \u2019 s not about policy or that people like Hillary , because they don \u2019 t . It \u2019 s that people aren \u2019 t comfortable with the idea of him having that much power .\n\u201c He could have the exact same policies that he has and be doing much better and be giving Hillary a more competitive challenge if he just came across as a reasonable person that you would trust with the levers of power . There \u2019 s no salvaging this campaign because there \u2019 s no changing Donald Trump . \u201d\nConway \u2019 s attempted Trump makeover isn \u2019 t limited to her candidate \u2019 s rhetoric and policy positions . She \u2019 s also taking another look at a difficult electoral map .\nConway canceled several previously scheduled events last week , hinting that she and campaign CEO Steve Bannon are still trying to rework the schedule they inherited and that resources , including the candidate himself , will likely be reallocated to where they \u2019 re needed most .\nFiguring out how to triage a presidential campaign when you \u2019 re bleeding in every swing state , all of which seem vital , is a difficult enough equation \u2014 and that \u2019 s without Trump spending time and resources last week in places that aren \u2019 t swing states at all . Trump sandwiched one rally in Tampa , Florida , between appearances in Texas and Mississippi , both solidly red states he \u2019 s unlikely to lose . And on Friday , his campaign announced a rally to be held Tuesday outside Seattle in Everett , Washington , home to a Boeing plant that ships planes overseas \u2014 a location that \u2019 s well suited for Trump to rail against global trade deals but makes no sense electorally .\nOn Saturday , Trump campaigned in Iowa , one of the few swing states in which his standing has not diminished over the past month .
