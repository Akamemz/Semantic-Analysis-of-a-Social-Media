    "content": "Bill Carter , a media analyst for CNN , covered the television industry for The New York Times for 25 years , and has written four books on TV , including The Late Shift and The War for Late Night . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own . View more opinion at CNN .\nJust about midnight , he and his crewmates were stirred roughly from a much too short sleep and told to get ready for what would be Mission # 10 of the 25 expected for their B-17 bomber .\nThe time alone was a signal that this might be the day most of their base at Nuthampstead -- indeed most of England \u2014 had been waiting for . Their mission the morning before , on June 5 , had been bombing German placements along the coast , instead of deeper into France or Germany -- a pointed hint that the big show , the Allied invasion of Europe , was due any day .\nAfter they had returned on June 5 , they found their plane 's name on the list -- a crowded mission list -- for the next morning . Like most young men of that time , the fliers of the 398th Bomb Group -- one of the B-17 bomb groups stationed in England and part of the 8th Air Force -- had signed up to serve their country in what they understood was a war for the survival of freedom . It was n't a sophisticated or complicated choice they were making ; it was n't even really a choice . It was a duty .\nThe men in the infantry who had been massing on Britain 's coast felt the same way . Young lives , lives just beginning , would be lost , they understood and accepted , simply and honestly . These days we look at these men as heroes . They never thought of themselves that way . They were just Americans , ready to do what was necessary to accomplish a goal they never questioned .\nThis account is based on the recollection of service from my dad , Richard Carter , and details from an account written by Paul Roderick , the extraordinary pilot of dad 's bomber crew .\nBy the time the crew made it to the briefing room on June 6 it was about 1:30 am . The sprawling briefing area was filled as always with tense , sweaty airmen \u2014 boys really . The 398th Bomb Group was made up of guys from every corner of America , all in their late teens and early 20s . Dad had turned 20 four months earlier , while still in training , learning his job as radio operator .\nThe intelligence briefer quickly confirmed the obvious on the big wall map : The invasion of France was about to commence . The men of the 398th were tasked with softening up German beach defenses before the infantry ran headlong into their hostile fire . The target was a French coastal village called Courseulles-sur-Mer . The group would be flying in advance support of a Canadian force that would be landing on Juno Beach .\nAt about 3:30 am , a cargo truck deposited the men , now in battle gear , outside their plane , number 42-97374 -- the `` Madame X , '' named for a reason dad never knew . The morning was typical of Britain , even in June : cold and damp .\nIn this July , 1944 photo , Bill Carter 's father Richard is third from left in the front row and 602nd Squadron pilot Paul Roderick is second from left in the top row .\nFor the fliers , the weather always brought hope and despair in equal measure : bad enough and a mission could be scrubbed , a reprieve from the gut-wrenching anticipation of another flight into the path of deadly flak and German fighters ; but at the same time a missed chance to knock one more mission off the path to 25 and ultimately escape back home .\nThe men climbed aboard their familiar bird , a machine they had come to believe in and love , most pulling themselves up through the open bomb bay . Inside , quarters were tight , not unlike a submarine , crowded with deadly equipment , the heavy machine guns and boxes of ammo , and the racks of 1,000 pound bombs .\nThe officers made their way into in the nose , pilot and copilot up in the cockpit , bombardier and navigator at their posts forward and below them . The gunners -- all sergeants -- took up positions in the tail , the open waist windows , the top turret , and down below in the revolving ball turret . On the plane 's left side , dad had his own desk with his mounted radio above him .\nAbove his post was a window with his own .50 caliber machine gun , pointed rearward . In a fight , every position was expected to be up and firing . The multiple firing positions were what made the B-17 a fortress , a creature German fighter pilots had learned was lethally dangerous .\nThe men who flew them almost universally believed the lumbering B-17 was a beauty to behold . No one really addressed the female nature of the machine carrying them into combat , but every plane was a she , no explanation needed . Of course , when they took flight , ready to fight for their lives , these men found themselves encased in a womb of safety . As long as they remained airborne , they had confidence it would deliver them home .\nJust after 0400 , the planes started up their engines . By 4:15 they began to roll slowly down scarily short runways , a long procession taxiing into position . The plane at the front of the line got the go signal and took off about 4:30 .\nBecause it was still dark and the conditions murky , dad and the other radio operators were tasked that morning with positioning themselves at the tail gunner 's post , sending off a radio code signal to the next plane in the line . This enabled the group to assemble at the prescribed altitude , creating the formation , two groups of 18 planes . The formation derived its strength from its combined firepower and the discipline to hang together through sometimes ferocious and terrifying combat .\nThe `` Madame X '' flew that morning as deputy leader in Squadron 5 . If anything happened to the lead plane , it would assume leadership . That position of importance reflected the confidence the wing command had in Lt. Roderick , a young man of 23 who simply took to flying as though born to do it .\nBut as much confidence as leadership had in him , his crew had far more . Most of the men who flew in the 8th Air Force understood their lives depended heavily on the man in the cockpit . The pre-dawn hours of June 6 were still cloudy , which limited visibility .\nBut as the phalanx of planes reached the coast of England , the skies cleared enough for the light of the dawning sun to reveal the vast armada arrayed below them . Dad could just make out the long gray line of vessels . His thought was how impressive and formidable they were , and how powerfully they would hit the entrenched Germans ; but also of how many of the ships , and the men in them , would not be coming back .\nThe assignment that morning was simple : Fly ahead of the landing craft and hit the Germans quickly . If the bombs could not be dropped for any reason , they could not be jettisoned into the Channel on the way back , as was normal practice -- not with all those Allied ships down below .\nBut by this point in the war , the Luftwaffe had been decimated by the relentless attacks of the Army Air Corps and Royal Air Force . There was no fighter opposition , and over Courseulles-sur-Mer there was no anti-aircraft fire that morning . Dad 's squadron got into its run and dropped its bombs just minutes ahead of the Canadians landing on Juno Beach . It was , in the jargon of the time , a `` milk run . ''\nIt was also a stark contrast to Mission # 4 , when an effort to bomb German naval vessels at the Kiel Canal on May 22 forced the `` Madame X '' into a wall of flak denser and more lethal than anything they had seen or would see again . A direct hit set an engine on fire . Losing power , the plane fell out of formation , an inviting target for Focke-Wulf fighters .\nAfter a vicious fight , the `` Madame X , '' damaged and shot up , rattled home to the base at Nuthampstead . The crew was limp from exhaustion and mortal fear .\nOn June 6 , the same plane landed smoothly only five hours after they had taken off . Though still breakfast time , the men were offered their routine shot of whiskey to calm nerves after a mission . Some of the men went immediately back to bed . Not dad , who was keyed up after every mission and especially this one , knowing what was taking place back where they had just been .\nIt would be many days before dad and his mates knew the fate of the invasion . In the meantime , they continued to fly . The next morning , it was on to Mission # 11 , submarine pens in the French town of Lorient on the Atlantic coast .\nThe `` Madame X '' flew missions through the summer of 1944 , and though planes continued to be shot down by flak , none in dad 's 602nd squadron was lost in combat . Because the danger had lessened , and because command wanted to push toward German surrender , the number of missions increased from the expected 25 , a decision my dad long remembered as maddening . Every combat mission was a test of mental strength and internal courage ; nobody needed extras .\nEventually , he and his crew flew 32 missions , wrapping up in September . None was ever wounded , though there were close calls . On the mission to Kiel , flak tore through the desk of the navigator , Frank Scribner , coming within inches of killing him . On another mission , a piece of flak about the size of a quarter flew through the floor of dad 's radio compartment and hit the heel of his boot knocking him off his feet .
