The indictment targets Alex van der Zwaan , a Dutch attorney based in London , for making false statements to the FBI .\nVan der Zwaan \u2019 s connection to the Russia case runs through Rick Gates , former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort \u2019 s deputy whom Mueller indicted in October , along with Manafort , on charges of money laundering and illegal lobbying .\nThe connection is convoluted , dealing with an internal Ukrainian political dispute from more than a decade ago \u2014 but it nonetheless says some interesting things about the state of the Russia investigation right now .\nHere \u2019 s what the indictment says , and why it tells us something important about Mueller \u2019 s strategy .\nIn the early 2010s , van der Zwaan was working in the London office of Skadden Arps , one of the world \u2019 s largest and most powerful corporate law firms . His work seemed to focus on the former Soviet Union .\nDuring this same time period , Manafort and Gates were working for Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych \u2014 a Kremlin-backed leader with dubious democratic credentials .\nYanukovych was in the midst of a power struggle with another prominent Ukrainian politician , which he decided to solve by jailing her in the fall of 2011 . Manafort and Gates \u2019 s job was to run cover for this clearly undemocratic prosecution . So they retained a team from Skadden Arps , which included van der Zwaan , to put together a \u201c report \u201d that conveniently concluded that there was no political motive for putting her in jail .\nThis was a big deal in Ukraine but a relatively obscure issue for most of the rest of the world . Manafort and Gates continued their work for Yanukovych afterward , and van der Zwaan moved on to other things \u2014 most notably marrying Eva Khan , the daughter of Ukrainian-Russian billionaire German Khan , in the summer of 2017 .
