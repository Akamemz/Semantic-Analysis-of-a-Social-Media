You were just too busy . You did n't think it mattered . '' ( At this point , the screen is occupied by young men with video controllers in their hands who appear fixated on a game . )\n`` Is that what you 're going to tell your friends who ca n't get married ? The ones who could n't serve openly in the military ? Are you going to tell them they ca n't make decisions about their own bodies anymore because you did n't think your vote counted ? ''\nYou get the picture . With more than a month to go before Election Day , but with early voting either already under way or soon to start in some swing states , the Obama campaign is tugging firmly on the cord connected to the human guilt response .\nRomney , by contrast , was working on doing some damage control following the release of the now-infamous video in which he can be seen talking about the `` 47 percent '' of the electorate .\nWhile he has n't technically apologized for his remarks , Romney was clearly guilty of creating a controversy that appears to have hurt him in the polls .\nTo many who saw the video Mother Jones made famous , Romney was reminiscent of Gordon Gekko . It did n't help that he was already being likened to that fictional Wall Street master of the universe even before the video from the fundraiser emerged .\nSo Romney 's ad featured the candidate talking directly into the camera to demonstrate that he does care about the concerns of average Americans . Repeating an argument he has turned to in recent days , Romney says in the ad :\n`` Too many Americans are struggling to find work in today 's economy . Too many of those who are working are living paycheck to paycheck trying to make falling incomes meet rising prices for food and gas .
