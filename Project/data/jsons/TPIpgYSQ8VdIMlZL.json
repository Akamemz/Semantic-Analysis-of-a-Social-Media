    "content_original": "West Point and Annapolis officials launched investigations this weekend to determine the motives of service-academy students who flashed hand signs on national television Saturday that in certain contexts are associated with \u201cwhite power.\u201d\n\nThe hand sign appeared to be displayed both by West Point cadets and Annapolis midshipmen during a broadcast of the annual Army-Navy football game in Philadelphia, but U.S. Military Academy officials haven\u2019t yet determined their intent, according to a West Point spokesman.\n\nAnnapolis officials appointed a preliminary inquiry officer to conduct an internal investigation, Annapolis spokeswoman Cdr. Alana Garas said Sunday. \u201cBased on findings of the investigation, those involved will be held appropriately accountable,\u201d she said.\n\nIn a statement Sunday, the Pentagon didn\u2019t comment on the hand signs but said its regulations \u201cmandate that military personnel reject active participation in organizations that advocate supremacist, extremist, or criminal gang doctrine.\u2019\u2019 \u201cWe\u2019re looking into it,\u201d said Lt. Col. Chris Ophardt, a West Point spokesman, soon after the sign appeared on national television Saturday afternoon. \u201cI don\u2019t know what their intention is.\u201d On Sunday, he said the school had officially launched an investigation \u201cnecessary to determine if administrative actions will be required.\u201d Last year, the Coast Guard came under criticism when a member of the service used a similar hand sign while in the background of a television broadcast. Coast Guard leadership issued an official reprimand to the officer who used the hand sign. The hand sign used is what looks like the \u201cokay\u201d sign, where the thumb and forefinger make a circle and the remaining three fingers are fully extended. The sign has also been used in what\u2019s known as the \u201ccircle game\u201d where someone extends the \u201cOK\u201d sign and if another person is tricked into looking at it, that second person gets punched in the arm. The sign took on a different significance for some people around 2017, according to the Anti-Defamation League, when it began to be used to signify white power. The ambiguity of the symbol was part of the reason it was used as an extremist meme, the ADL says. The gesture was displayed as ESPN broadcast a segment from the student section, where both cadets and midshipmen made what appeared to be the \u201cOK\u201d sign. \u201cBecause of the traditional meaning of the \u2018OK\u2019 hand gesture, as well as other usages unrelated to white supremacy, particular care must be taken not to jump to conclusions about the intent behind someone who has used the gesture,\u201d the Anti-Defamation League says.
