Some acted as rhetorical bomb throwers, either for left or right. Others sought to mediate and moderate \u2014 or perhaps just gave the appearance of doing so in order to calm others\u2019 fears. And one liberal justice defected from his ideological cohorts, to their chagrin.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: The woman who killed affirmative action. Twice)\n\nHere are five takeaways from the justices\u2019 decision holding that voters have the right to implement bans on racial preferences in higher education, hiring and contracting:\n\n1. It\u2019s all about affirmative action \u2014 or not\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s announcement of the court\u2019s ruling began in a defensive crouch, flatly denying that the decision was about affirmative action before anyone had the chance even to level the charge.\n\n\u201cIt is important to note what this case is not about. It is not about the constitutionality, or the merits, of race-conscious admissions policies in higher education,\u201d Kennedy wrote. \u201cThis case is not about how the debate about racial preferences should be resolved. It is about who may resolve it.\u201d\n\nPerhaps. But many of the other justices seemed unwilling or unable to cleanly separate the issues.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor\u2019s 58-page dissent does a deep dive on affirmative action, including three charts from The New York Times and one from The Wall Street Journal showing how enrollment of African-American and Latino students in certain California and Michigan schools declined after race-based preferences were halted.\n\n( Earlier on POLITICO: SCOTUS upholds ban on affirmative action)\n\n\u201cThese statistics may not influence the views of some of my colleagues,\u201d Sotomayor wrote. Their desire to end affirmative action, she argued, \u201cignores the importance of diversity in institutions of higher education and reveals how little my colleagues understand about the reality of race in America.\u201d\n\nSotomayor sounded like such an advocate for affirmative action that Chief Justice John Roberts wrote his own concurring opinion complaining about what he saw as transparent lobbying on the subject.\n\n\u201cThe dissent devotes 11 pages to expounding its own policy preferences in favor of taking race into account in college admissions, while nonetheless concluding that it \u2018do[es] not mean to suggest that the virtues of adopting race-sensitive admissions policies should inform the legal question before the Court,\u2019\u201d Roberts scoffed.\n\nAnd Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, also felt compelled to throw in a few sharp words on affirmative action, noting Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor\u2019s 2003 observation that use of race in higher education \u201cwill no longer be necessary\u201d in 25 years.\n\n( PHOTOS: 21 landmark SCOTUS rulings)\n\n\u201cGrutter\u2019s bell may soon toll,\u201d Scalia wrote, referring to that 2003 case. \u201cThe battleground for this case is not the constitutionality of race-based admissions \u2014 at least not quite.\u201d\n\n2. A win for ballot measures?\n\nFor decades the court has said that it judges all kinds of governmental enactments with the same yardstick, be they congressional or state legislation, city council ordinances, mayoral or police orders or ballot measures approved by voters.\n\nBut Kennedy\u2019s core opinion in the Michigan case seems to exalt referenda as a kind of direct democracy that the courts should be particularly reluctant to disturb. That might be a problem for same-sex marriage opponents if a future Supreme Court challenge involves a state law or constitutional amendment enacted by voters.\n\n\u201cMichigan voters exercised their privilege to enact laws as a basic exercise of their democratic power,\u201d Kennedy wrote. \u201cMichigan voters used the initiative system to bypass public officials who were deemed not responsive to the concerns of a majority of the voters with respect to a policy of granting race-based preferences that raises difficult and delicate issues.\u201d\n\n( PHOTOS: Who\u2019s who on the Supreme Court)\n\nSome analysts saw Kennedy\u2019s celebration of referenda as notable because for decades many in the legal system viewed such enactments as particularly suspect because they could represent a kind of backlash spurred by ugly motives. Experts also pointed to Kennedy\u2019s roots in California \u2014 a state that has long seen robust use of ballot measures.\n\n\u201cThe Kennedy plurality opinion [makes] a measure passed by initiative seem more worthy of protection as an expression of a kind of pure majoritarianism \u2014 of what people really want,\u201d said University of California at Irvine law professor Rick Hasen. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t change the legal standards on judicial review of initiatives, but I do think it sets a mood that says there should not be suspicion of what the majority wants.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt looked like the court is saying this process should be given some deference,\u201d said Bob Stern of the Center for Governmental Studies.\n\nBut Kennedy\u2019s record of deferring to voters is a mixed one.
