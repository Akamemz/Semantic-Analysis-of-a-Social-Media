( AP ) \u2014 Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang wants to give cash to every American each month .\nSusie Garza has never heard of Yang . But since February , she \u2019 s been getting $ 500 a month from a nonprofit in Stockton , California , as part of an experiment that offers something unusual in presidential politics : a trial run of a campaign promise , highlighting the benefits and challenges in real time .\nGarza can spend the money however she wants . She uses $ 150 of it to pay for her cellphone and another $ 100 or so to pay off her dog \u2019 s veterinarian bills . She spends the rest on her two grandsons now that she can afford to buy them birthday presents online and let them get the big bag of chips at the 7-Eleven .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve never been able to do that . I thought it was just the coolest thing , \u201d said Garza , who is unemployed and previously was addicted to drugs , though she said she has been sober for 18 years following a stint in prison . \u201c I like it because I feel more independent , like I \u2019 m in charge . I really have something that \u2019 s my own . \u201d\nGarza is part of an experiment testing the impact of \u201c universal basic income , \u201d an old idea getting new life thanks to the 2020 presidential race , although Stockton \u2019 s project is an independent one and has no connection to any presidential race .\nYang , a tech entrepreneur , has anchored his longshot bid with a proposal to give $ 1,000 in cash to every American , saying the payments will shield workers from the pain of certain job losses caused by automation . The idea has helped him win unexpected support and even muscle out some better-known candidates from the debate stages . His proposal isn \u2019 t too far off from one by U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris , one of the top contenders for the Democratic nomination , who has a proposal to give up to $ 500 a month to working families .\nStockton , once known as the foreclosure capital of the country and for one of the nation \u2019 s largest municipal bankruptcies , is a step ahead of both candidates . In February , the city launched the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration , a pilot program spearheaded by a new mayor and financed in part by the nonprofit led by Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes . The city chose 125 people who live in census tracts at or below the city \u2019 s median household income of $ 46,033 . They get the money on a debit card on the 15th of each month .\n\u201c I think poverty is immoral , I think it is antiquated and I think it shouldn \u2019 t exist , \u201d said Michael Tubbs , the city \u2019 s 29-year-old Democratic mayor .\nTubbs \u2019 personal story includes a cousin who was killed , a father who is in prison and a mother who , as a teenager , raised him with the help of multiple jobs . He found his way to Stanford and public service , where he persuaded his beleaguered city to sign on to a provocative new idea : guaranteed cash .\nStockton residents , who have elected Republican mayors for 16 out of the last 22 years , were skeptical , worried about encouraging people not to work . Tubbs said he calmed their fears by noting the money came from private donations , not taxpayer dollars .\n\u201c I would tell people all that time that would be upset or would call angry , I would say , well , I \u2019 m just as angry as you are , but I \u2019 m angry about the problem . I \u2019 m not angry about possible solutions , \u201d Tubbs said .\nA team of researchers is monitoring the participants . Their chief interest is not finances but happiness . They are using what they call a \u201c mattering scale \u201d to measure how much people feel like they matter to society .\n\u201c Do people notice you are there ? Those things are correlated to health and well-being , \u201d said Stacia Martin-West , a researcher at the University of Tennessee who is working on the program along with Amy Castro-Baker at the University of Pennsylvania .\nThe money has made Jovan Bravo happier . The 31-year-old Stockton native and construction worker is married and has three children , ages 13 , 8 and 4 . He said he didn \u2019 t see enough of his children when he worked six days a week to pay the bills .\nThat changed when he started getting $ 500 a month . Now he only works one Saturday a month . He uses the other Saturdays to take his kids to the amusement park and ride bikes with them in the park .\n\u201c It \u2019 s made a huge difference , \u201d he said . \u201c Just being able to spend more time with the wife and kids , it brings us closer together . \u201d\nStockton officials do not release the names of the program participants . They arrange interviews with journalists only for those who volunteer to discuss their experiences .\nThe idea of a guaranteed income dates back to at least the 18th century and has crossed ideological and cultural lines .\nIn the 1960s and 1970s , Republicans Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney oversaw four guaranteed-income experiments scattered across the country when Rumsfeld , later a defense secretary , was director of President Richard Nixon \u2019 s Office of Economic Opportunity and Cheney , the future vice president , was his deputy .\nThe program had some hiccups , including a woman who spent all the money on alcohol and a man who went into debt buying expensive furniture for his government-subsidized apartment , according to a 1970 New York Times story . But the experiment concluded that the money did not stop people from working and led Nixon to propose expanding the program , which ultimately did not pass Congress .\nSince then , other studies have reached similar results . A 2018 study in Alaska , where residents have gotten a share of the state \u2019 s oil revenue every year since 1982 , found the money has not shrunk the state \u2019 s labor force . The same was found in a 2010 UCLA study in North Carolina , where the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians has shared casino revenue with its members since the mid-1990s .\nThe latest momentum comes with the help of the technology industry , which is grappling with how to prepare for the job losses likely to come with automation and artificial intelligence .\nThe tech connection has drawn criticism from left-leaning labor unions skeptical of the industry \u2019 s motives .\n\u201c We think the future of work should be defined by working people , not tech billionaires , \u201d said Steve Smith , spokesman for the California Labor Federation , a group of 1,200 unions and a reliable ally for some of the state \u2019 s most liberal policies . \u201c If there are no jobs available , you are pretty much stuck with your $ 1,000 a month check while the CEO of the tech company that automated you out of a job is being paid a billion dollars a year . \u201d\nOther critics note that the programs can chip away at the social safety net . Yang \u2019 s plan requires recipients to decline food stamps and some other government assistance .\nThere \u2019 s also the question of how to pay for it .\nStockton \u2019 s program , giving 125 people $ 500 per month for 18 months , will cost just over $ 1.1 million . Harris \u2019 plan , which covers working families making up to $ 100,000 annually , would cost about $ 275 billion per year , according to the Tax Policy Center . To pay for it , she says she would repeal some of the 2017 GOP tax cuts and impose new taxes on corporations .\nYang \u2019 s plan , which covers every adult in the United States , would cost $ 2.8 trillion per year . He would impose a new tax on businesses \u2019 goods and services while shrinking some other government assistance programs . Representatives for Yang and Harris did not respond to interview requests .\nThe Stockton experiment runs through July 2020 . Researchers expect to release their first round of data this fall , when the presidential campaigns are preparing for the Iowa caucuses and state primaries .\nTubbs says he already sees success in making the city a focal point in the discussion about the future of capitalism and the U.S. economy . But once the experiment is over , he \u2019 s not sure what \u2019 s next .
