He didn \u2019 t look smart in the sense of a rapid-response communications system that could get him out of the trouble he was in . \u201d\nMore troubling for Bush is that many supporters are getting jittery because he appeared ill-equipped to appreciate and manage the demands of the modern-day , 24-hour news cycle . And , they note , this isn \u2019 t the first time Bush has floundered over what he believes \u2013 a waffling that could undermine his reputation as a deep-thinking ideas man comfortable in his own skin , one who decries politicians \u201c who just bend with the wind . \u201d\nBut Bush appeared to do just that last month , according to conservatives who criticized his shifting positions over Indiana \u2019 s Religious Freedom Restoration Act , which allowed some businesses to deny some services \u2013 in effect , to gays \u2014 based on the owner \u2019 s religious views . Bush said it was \u201c the right thing \u201d to do .\nThen , an anti-discrimination national backlash against Indiana brewed . The state clarified the law to ensure it didn \u2019 t allow for discrimination based on people \u2019 s sexual orientation or gender identification . Bush changed right along with it by saying the law was \u201c in the right place [ because ] we shouldn \u2019 t discriminate based on sexual orientation . \u201d\n\u201c Jeb Bush Backtracks on Religious Liberty , \u201d a Reason blogger wrote . \u201c How Does Jeb Bush Feel About RFRA ? Apparently , He Can \u2019 t Decide , \u201d the blog Chicks on the Right opined . \u201c Jeb Bush seems to shift tone on Indiana RFRA at fundraiser , \u201d said a Hot Air blog headline .\nBush was in eerily similar circumstances two years before , in 2013 , when he was plugging his new book \u201c Immigration Wars : Forging an American Solution. \u201d The former Florida governor , who previously supported a pathway to citizenship for some illegal immigrants , wrote that he now backed a pathway to legal residency only .\n\u201c Those who violated the laws can remain but can not obtain the cherished fruits of citizenship , \u201d Bush and co-author Clint Bolick wrote .\nOops . By the time Bush \u2019 s book was out , the political landscape had briefly shifted and his longtime friend and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 , Sen. Marco Rubio , was at the time a member of the so-called \u201c Gang of Eight \u201d that proposed a pathway to citizenship in its legislation . So Bush , after fumbling to explain his change of heart , reversed course again and explained that he supported a pathway to residency because he generally thought it was the most politically palatable option when he was penning the book , before the Gang of Eight bill .\n\u201c I have supported both \u2014 both a path to legalization or a path to citizenship \u2014 with the underlying principle being that there should be no incentive for people to come illegally at the expense of coming legally , \u201d Bush told CNN in a tortured explanation that The New York Times described Bush as \u201c backpedaling . \u201d\n\u201c As political re-entries go , Jeb Bush \u2019 s has been rocky , \u201d the Times wrote on March 5 , 2013 .\n\u201c Welcome to life as a potential presidential candidate ! When you leave open the door to a presidential bid , and are no long just an elder statesman for the party , every little thing starts to become magnified \u2013 which has happened to Jeb Bush over the past 24 hours , \u201d NBC \u2019 s \u201c First Read \u201d blog wrote at the time . \u201c Here \u2019 s something to remember about Bush : He hasn \u2019 t run a race since 2002 ( before Facebook , Twitter , and more partisan media ) . \u201d\nChange the dates and the topic , and Bush \u2019 s multiple explanations and prolonged waffling are much like what happened to him in describing the Iraq War to FOX \u2019 s Megan Kelly , who asked last Saturday if he would have invaded Iraq \u201c knowing what we know now. \u201d Bush said yes and falsely said Hillary Clinton would have done the same thing .\nAfter that interview , which took place Saturday , some in Bush \u2019 s orbit realized he might have a problem and discussed whether to call Kelly to clarify his remarks . On Sunday , Fox published a news story teasing the interview that was to air the following day . Once the interview aired , critics and opponents pounced .\nOn Tuesday morning , Bush \u2019 s longtime friend and CNN commentator Ana Navarro said on the network that she asked Bush what he meant because even she was confused . Navarro said Bush told her that he \u201c misheard \u201d the question . Some in Bush \u2019 s inner circle were furious with Navarro and blamed her for making the situation worse \u2013 though many believe she felt the need to try to protect her friend as the situation spiraled out of control without an adequate explanation .\nBush finally decided to address the issue in a softball interview Tuesday on conservative commentator Sean Hannity \u2019 s radio show , where he explained he \u201c interpreted the question wrong , I guess. \u201d Bush said he believed the question referred to what he would have done with the available intelligence at the time .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t know what that decision would have been . That \u2019 s a hypothetical . But the simple fact is that mistakes were made , \u201d Bush said . On Wednesday , at a Nevada event , Bush continued to refuse to answer \u201c hypotheticals \u201d and said that , in this case , such speculation \u201c does a disservice for a lot of people that sacrificed a lot. \u201d He then had a testy exchange with a college student who accused him of being \u201c pedantic \u201d in responding to her .\nFinally , after four days and four different explanations , Bush broke down : \u201c If we \u2019 re all supposed to answer hypothetical questions : Knowing what we now know , what would you have done ? I would not have engaged . I would not have gone into Iraq . \u201d\nFormer Republican consultant Ed Rollins , who worked on Ronald Reagan \u2019 s campaigns as well as Mike Huckabee \u2019 s 2008 race , said running for president today takes a deep appreciation for the changes in the news media cycle . And , he said , it didn \u2019 t appear Bush was aware of that .\n\u201c Both he and Hillary Clinton don \u2019 t appear ready for prime time . She \u2019 s had the worst few weeks of any candidate I \u2019 ve ever seen , and Jeb was a close second this week , \u201d Rollins said . \u201c But she has no real Democratic challenger while he \u2019 s got a very , very tough battle in the Republican primary . He can \u2019 t afford to make these types of mistakes . \u201d\n\u201c Making a basic misstep like that with a question that was perfectly , 100 percent predictable is frankly astonishing , \u201d Randy Scheunemann , a former adviser to defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld under Bush \u2019 s brother , told BuzzFeed . \u201c It does not bode well for his candidacy . \u201d\nState Rep. Matt Gaetz , a Bush backer , said the coverage surrounding Bush \u2019 s statements over Iraq was overblown . He said that voters would ultimately support Bush because , in the end , they would view his comments and his accessibility \u2013 in stark contrast to the off-limits Clinton \u2013 as \u201c authentic . \u201d\n\u201c Jeb doesn \u2019 t surround himself with yes men . But he hates being handled , and this is what happens when you don \u2019 t have a real campaign , when you don \u2019 t have someone who manages the candidate because he \u2019 s not really a candidate , \u201d said one longtime Bush-backing Republican . \u201c And even if Jeb was prepared , if he had his talking points , he obviously didn \u2019 t prepare enough . \u201d\nAnother Bush supporter pointed out that Bush , before Kelly \u2019 s interview , had just come from a speech at Liberty University in Virginia . He was likely tired . And he underestimated the importance of the interview .\n\u201c He probably thought \u2018 Oh , it \u2019 s FOX . It \u2019 s a friendly interview. \u2019 And he got caught with his guard down . And this is like boxing without a rest : Never let your guard down , \u201d the supporter said .

It \u2019 s nothing that $ 100 million can \u2019 t fix , \u201d said Bossie , referring to the quarterly fundraising goal the Bush camp hopes to meet by the end of this month .\nBossie said he believed Bush needed to declare his candidacy so he can have a traditional campaign infrastructure around him to help him handle all of the rigors of the campaign trail .\nBush made clear in his FOX interview that he wasn \u2019 t yet a candidate .
