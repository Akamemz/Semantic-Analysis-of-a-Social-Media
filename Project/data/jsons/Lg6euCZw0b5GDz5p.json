    "content": "On September 27th , when Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee , the South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham delivered a four-minute speech that turned Kavanaugh \u2019 s Supreme Court confirmation process decisively . An hour earlier , Kavanaugh had delivered a furious , partisan opening statement decrying the sexual-assault allegations against him , which he attributed in part to Democrats seeking \u201c revenge on behalf of the Clintons , \u201d but until Graham \u2019 s speech it wasn \u2019 t obvious that the Republicans were behind him . \u201c Boy , y \u2019 all want power ! God , I hope you never get it , \u201d Graham seethed at the Democrats across the dais . A minute later , Graham turned toward Kavanaugh , paused , and a strange , provocative exchange unfolded . \u201c Do you consider this a job interview ? \u201d Graham asked . Kavanaugh began , sounding a bit professorial , \u201c The advise-and-consent role is like a job interview. \u201d \u201c Do you consider what you \u2019 ve been through a job interview ? \u201d \u201c I \u2019 ve been through a process of advise-and-consent under the Constitution. \u201d \u201c Would you say you \u2019 ve been through Hell ? \u201d There was a pause at this , as Kavanaugh recognized , belatedly , what Graham had been after , and the relief it would supply . \u201c I would say I \u2019 ve been through Hell and then some , \u201d Kavanaugh said . \u201c This was not a job interview . This was Hell. \u201d Kavanaugh is a practicing Catholic . Those words must have had some specific meaning for him , but his monologue had lingered on the damage to his reputation rather than the experience of his soul .

Of course , Ford , who credibly accused Kavanaugh of trying to rape her when they were teen-agers , has received death threats , too , and had to relive her sexual assault in front of the nation , only to have the President of the United States enliven a political rally by questioning why she could not remember some of the details . And her own version of Hell did not end , as Kavanaugh \u2019 s almost certainly will today , with a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court .
