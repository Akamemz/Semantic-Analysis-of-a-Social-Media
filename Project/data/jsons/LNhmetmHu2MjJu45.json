    "content": "While America \u2019 s political kingmakers inject their millions into high-profile presidential and congressional contests , Democratic mega-donor George Soros has directed his wealth into an under-the-radar 2016 campaign to advance one of the progressive movement \u2019 s core goals \u2014 reshaping the American justice system .\nThe billionaire financier has channeled more than $ 3 million into seven local district-attorney campaigns in six states over the past year \u2014 a sum that exceeds the total spent on the 2016 presidential campaign by all but a handful of rival super-donors .\nHis money has supported African-American and Hispanic candidates for these powerful local roles , all of whom ran on platforms sharing major goals of Soros \u2019 , like reducing racial disparities in sentencing and directing some drug offenders to diversion programs instead of to trial . It is by far the most tangible action in a progressive push to find , prepare and finance criminal justice reform-oriented candidates for jobs that have been held by longtime incumbents and serve as pipelines to the federal courts \u2014 and it has inspired fury among opponents angry about the outside influence in local elections .\n\u201c The prosecutor exercises the greatest discretion and power in the system . It is so important , \u201d said Andrea Dew Steele , president of Emerge America , a candidate-training organization for Democratic women . \u201c There \u2019 s been a confluence of events in the past couple years and all of the sudden , the progressive community is waking up to this . \u201d\nSoros has spent on district attorney campaigns in Florida , Illinois , Louisiana , Mississippi , New Mexico and Texas through a network of state-level super PACs and a national \u201c 527 \u201d unlimited-money group , each named a variation on \u201c Safety and Justice. \u201d ( Soros has also funded a federal super PAC with the same name . ) Each organization received most of its money directly from Soros , according to public state and federal financial records , though some groups also got donations from nonprofits like the Civic Participation Action Fund , which gave to the Safety and Justice group in Illinois .\nThe Florida Safety and Justice group just poured nearly $ 1.4 million \u2014 all of which came from Soros and his 527 group \u2014 into a previously low-budget Democratic primary for state attorney in Central Florida before Tuesday \u2019 s vote . The group is backing Aramis Ayala , a former public defender and prosecutor , in her campaign against incumbent Jeff Ashton , whose jurisdiction covers over 1.6 million people across two counties in metro Orlando .\nOne TV ad from Florida Safety and Justice boosts Ayala , touting her \u201c plan to remove bias so defendants charged with the same crime receive the same treatment , no matter their background or race. \u201d The Soros-funded group is also attacking Ashton with ads saying he \u201c got rid of protections that helped ensure equal treatment regardless of background or race . ... Take two similar traffic incidents that happened on the same night . A white man got off with a slap on the wrist , while the black man faces prison . \u201d\nOpponents of Soros \u2019 favored candidates have laced into the billionaire , saying that his influence has wildly tipped the scales of local elections and even charging that he made residents less safe .\n\u201c As a candidate and citizen of Caddo Parish , if an outsider was that interested in the race , I wanted to know exactly what he had in mind for the criminal justice system if he were to win , \u201d said Dhu Thompson , a Louisiana attorney who lost a district attorney race to a Soros-backed candidate , James Stewart , in 2015 . Soros gave over $ 930,000 \u2014 more than 22 times the local median household income \u2014 to the group boosting Stewart .\n\u201c I know some of his troubling opinions on social issues , especially the criminal justice system , \u201d Thompson said . \u201c I \u2019 ve never known him as an individual who was very strong on some of our crime and punishment issues . I felt it was very detrimental to the safety of Caddo Parish , and that \u2019 s why I took such a strong stand against him . \u201d\nA Soros representative declined to comment on his involvement in the DA races .\nProgressive operatives and activists say that the recent uptick in news coverage of racial justice issues , especially police-involved deaths of African-Americans , helped sparked intense new interest in the powerful role of district attorneys , who did not indict officers in some high-profile cases . So has the longer-term reform push to shrink the U.S. prison population and promote treatment over punishment for drug users .\nReform groups have spent years advocating criminal justice policies and legislation that would reduce incarceration rates . Liberal donors have long given to policy-focused nonprofits ; the Soros-chaired Open Societies Foundation , for example , works on drug policy and criminal justice reform and has supported other reform groups like the California-based Alliance for Safety and Justice \u2014 which , despite its similar name , has had no involvement in district attorney races , a spokeswoman said .\nProsecutorial discretion gives district attorneys a huge say in the charges and sentences that defendants face . But reform efforts have not traditionally focused on harnessing that power .\n\u201c They are often a very invisible part of the criminal justice system and the political system , \u201d said Brenda Carter , director of the Reflective Democracy Campaign , an arm of the progressive Women Donors Network . \u201c Many people can \u2019 t name their district attorney . It \u2019 s not an office people think about a lot . \u201d\nCarter \u2019 s group commissioned research in 2015 that found that 95 percent of elected local prosecutors in the U.S. are white and three-quarters overall are white men . It also highlighted a Wake Forest University study that found that a vast majority of prosecutors \u2014 85 percent \u2014 run for reelection unopposed .\n\u201c I found that to be shocking , and I think people are waking up to the untapped potential for intervention in these seats to really change the day-to-day realities of criminal justice , \u201d Carter said . \u201c It \u2019 s been really gratifying for us to see the research taken up and run with by different groups around the country . \u201d\nArmed with that knowledge , progressive groups including Color of Change began researching potentially interesting district attorney races around the country , multiple sources said . ( The organization declined to comment . )\n\u201c It \u2019 s hard to find this information ! \u201d exclaimed Steele , the Emerge America president . \u201c You can \u2019 t just Google \u2018 hot DA races. \u2019 So part of the issue is identifying what potential races there are . \u201d\nSoros \u2019 spending started on these races about a year ago , when he put over $ 1 million into \u201c Safety and Justice \u201d groups that helped elect two new district attorneys in Louisiana and Mississippi and reelect a third \u2014 Hinds County , Miss. , DA Robert Shuler Smith \u2014 who has since been charged by the Mississippi attorney general with improperly providing information to defendants .\nThe other Mississippi district attorney Soros \u2019 spending helped elect , Scott Colom , has now represented a four-county stretch of the eastern part of the state for eight months . Colom said in an interview that he has focused on prosecuting violent crime in his new position while trying not to burden local prisons with first-time , low-level drug offenders .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve expanded the charges eligible for pre-trial diversion , \u201d Colom said , adding that the number of people in the program in his jurisdiction has doubled since he took office seven months ago . \u201c It \u2019 s all focused on the individual person , on trying to find a plan with the best chance possible of avoiding criminal behavior . \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 m sure there are plenty of people out there who think prison is too nice and we need to spend more on it , \u201d Colom continued . \u201c But it seems like a large majority of people out there get it and realize there have to be priorities . Just because a fella commits a crime doesn \u2019 t mean the best outcome is sending them to jail . ... As much as possible , I want to take people from being tax burdens to taxpayers . \u201d\nAfter the Louisiana and Mississippi races , Soros next piled money into two of the biggest jurisdictions in the country : Houston \u2019 s Harris County ( his lone losing effort so far ) and Chicago \u2019 s Cook County , where he funded one of several groups that helped Kim Foxx defeat incumbent state \u2019 s attorney Anita Alvarez in a high-profile primary campaign dominated by the 13-month delay between the police shooting of Laquan McDonald and the indictment of the police officer involved .\nIn late spring , $ 107,000 from a Soros-funded New Mexico super PAC helped Raul Torrez win his Democratic district attorney primary by a 2-to-1 margin in Albuquerque \u2019 s Bernalillo County . Torrez \u2019 s Republican opponent dropped out of the general election soon after , citing the potentially exorbitant cost of opposing the Soros-backed candidate in the general election .\nWhile Soros has spent heavily in 2015 and 2016 , a broader national push into local prosecutor campaigns is expected to intensify in the next few years , thanks to longer-term planning and candidate recruitment . A Safety and Justice group has already organized in Ohio , according to campaign finance filings there . But it has not yet disclosed raising or spending any money .\n\u201c There \u2019 s been a realization that there \u2019 s not very much we can do this year , when you \u2019 re coming up to an election , \u201d said Steele . \u201c You have to have the right candidates . That \u2019 s a big piece of the puzzle and why I \u2019 m part of this conversation . ... A lot of the conversations I \u2019 m having are about 2017 and 2018 , about looking forward to next year in Virginia and other places . \u201d\nThat means more local candidates should prepare for the shock of one of the biggest donors in American politics flooding their neighborhoods with ads .\nColom , the Mississippi prosecutor , says he has never met Soros \u2014 like other district attorney candidates supported by the Democratic billionaire this year . He said there was no hint that hundreds of thousands of dollars were coming to aid his campaign until advertising started pushing the same criminal-justice reform message that Colom had been touting \u2014 albeit on a much cheaper scale .\n\u201c The first I heard of it , someone told me they liked my radio ad , and I was thinking , that doesn \u2019 t sound like one of mine , \u201d Colom said .",
