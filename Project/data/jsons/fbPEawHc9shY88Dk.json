As Jocko Willink would say , \u201c GET AFTER IT ! \u201d\nThe most significant protests in eight years are rocking Iran , with state media reporting Tuesday that the death toll from clashes between demonstrators and security forces had reached at least 20 . Offering his first comments during the six days of unrest , Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Tuesday accused the \u201c enemies of Iran \u201d of meddling in the country \u2019 s affairs . Hundreds of people have been arrested and activists are taking the rare step of publicly criticizing the country \u2019 s religious leaders . They are the largest protests since the country \u2019 s disputed 2009 presidential election \u2013 which triggered the so-called \u201c Green Movement. \u201d State TV reported Tuesday that six people were killed during an attack on a police station in the town of Qahdarijan . It reported that clashes were sparked by rioters who tried to steal guns from the police station .\nOf course , that \u2019 s state TV during a time of crisis , so take it with way more than just the ordinary grain of salt . Maybe something along the scale of the Great Salt Lake .\nPresident Trump , this morning : \u201c The people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime . All of the money that President Obama so foolishly gave them went into terrorism and into their \u2018 pockets. \u2019 The people have little food , big inflation and no human rights . The U.S. is watching ! \u201d\nBret Stephens of the New York Times : \u201c If Trump had failed to weigh in , he \u2019 d be slammed ( rightly ) for ignoring human rights . Instead , he \u2019 s attacked ( wrongly ) for \u2018 meddling. \u2019 So far , he \u2019 s getting Iran right . Behooves his usual critics ( like me ) to say so . \u201d\nBloomberg \u2019 s Eli Lake argues , \u201c Time to end the expert class nonsense that there are hardliners and moderates in Iran . Javad Zarif and Ayatollah Khamenei are on the same side , the side of clerical tyranny . \u201d\nEvery couple of years I enjoy dragging out Fareed Zakaria \u2019 s 2009 Newsweek cover piece , \u201c Everything You Know About Iran Is Wrong. \u201d Zakaria \u2019 s got the sterling resume \u2014 Yale , Harvard , managing editor of Foreign Affairs , adjunct professor at Columbia \u2014 and he wrote , in what must have been a heavily researched piece , that Iran \u2019 s regime might \u201c be happy with a peaceful civilian [ nuclear ] program , \u201d \u201c Iranians aren \u2019 t suicidal. \u201d \u201c Iran isn \u2019 t a dictatorship , \u201d and it has a culture of \u201c considerable debate and dissent. \u201d Newsweek readers no doubt concluded that hyperbolic media coverage had obscured the reality of Iran , which was a sophisticated , multifaceted , modern state that is not so scary or brutal after all .\nA month after the Zakaria piece ran , the Iranian regime announced Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had won reelection with 60 percent of the vote , a result that many Iranians concluded had to be fraudulent . The regime crushed the Green Revolution with brutal force , shooting women like Neda Agha-Soltan in the street . Within a matter of months , President Obama announced \u201c the United States , the United Kingdom , and France presented detailed evidence to the IAEA demonstrating that the Islamic Republic of Iran has been building a covert uranium enrichment facility near Qom for several years . \u201d\nIf you had previously seen Iran as a country dominated by a brutal , dangerously aggressive , nuclear-ambitious regime that already demonstrated a willingness to use children to clear minefields and embraced a philosophy of risk and sacrifice unthinkable to Western values . . . it turns out everything you knew about Iran wasn \u2019 t wrong . Everything Fareed Zakaria knew was wrong .\nThe point of this is not that Zakaria is dumb . The point is that Zarakia saw what he wanted to see in Iran . The world would be a better , happier , nicer place if the Iran of 2009 or today lived up to the benign , reasonable portrait that Zarakia painted in his cover piece .\nSpeaking of influential voices who insisted upon seeing Iran as they wished to see it , instead of acknowledging counter-evidence , Lake envisions former president Barack Obama speaking out for the protesting Iranians .\nThere is currently a Change.org petition urging Obama to speak out in favor of the demonstrations . That is a good start . But the former president should do more . He should devote his good offices to publicizing the cause of Iranian freedom . No American can lead Iran \u2019 s opposition , but Obama \u2019 s unique understanding of grassroots activism puts him in an ideal position to lead the Western cause of solidarity . He could organize lawyers , newspaper editors , teachers , librarians and human rights groups to partner Iranians under siege , following the Jewish-American movement to allow Soviet refuseniks to emigrate .\nDon \u2019 t hold your breath waiting for that to happen , Eli !\nThis morning , Matthew Dowd looks back at the Obama administration \u2019 s Iran deal and laments , \u201c I am wondering how many folks are aware that the money the US sent Iran as part of nuclear deal was actually Iran \u2019 s assets to begin with . It was their own money we returned . It wasn \u2019 t taxpayer money . \u201d\nYes , but we froze those assets after they raided our embassy , took American diplomatic staff hostage in violation of just about every international law and treaty , paraded them before the cameras , and beat them . Think of the seized assets as a criminal fine , one of the few ways we could punish the Iranians for their barbaric acts against our people .\n\u2018 A Wave of Optimism Has Swept over American Business Leaders \u2019\nWhen the New York Times offers good news for the Trump administration , it is no longer \u201c lying , \u201d \u201c failing , \u201d or \u201c Sad ! \u201d Because the president is probably grinning wildly at this front-page story :\nA wave of optimism has swept over American business leaders , and it is beginning to translate into the sort of investment in new plants , equipment and factory upgrades that bolsters economic growth , spurs job creation \u2014 and may finally raise wages significantly . While business leaders are eager for the tax cuts that take effect this year , the newfound confidence was initially inspired by the Trump administration \u2019 s regulatory pullback , not so much because deregulation is saving companies money but because the administration has instilled a faith in business executives that new regulations are not coming . \u201c It \u2019 s an overall sense that you \u2019 re not going to face any new regulatory fights , \u201d said Granger MacDonald , a home builder in Kerrville , Tex . \u201c We \u2019 re not spending more , which is the main thing . We \u2019 re not seeing any savings , but we \u2019 re not seeing any increases . \u201d\nMeanwhile , the Wall Street Journal finds more good news in the latest wage numbers :\nIn U.S. cities with the tightest labor markets , workers are finding something that \u2019 s long been missing from the broader economic expansion : faster-growing paychecks . Workers in metro areas with the lowest unemployment are experiencing among the strongest wage growth in the country . The labor market in places like Minneapolis , Denver and Fort Myers , Fla. , where unemployment rates stand near or even below 3 % , has now tightened to a point where businesses are raising pay to attract employees , often from competitors . It \u2019 s an outcome entirely expected in economic theory , but one that \u2019 s been largely absent until now in the upturn that began more than eight years ago .\nIf you missed how the tax bill was bringing about \u201c Armageddon \u201d just as Nancy Pelosi predicted , see the updates here , here , and here .\nOur Kyle Smith , following the evidence where it leads , even if it wasn \u2019 t the outcome he expected or predicted :\nLike many conservatives , I had grave concerns about curtailing the New York City police department \u2019 s controversial tactic of stopping and frisking potential suspects for weapons . I was inclined to defer to the police when they protested that they needed the option to stop , question , and frisk New Yorkers on a mere reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing instead of probable cause that the targeted person had committed a crime . Restricting the tactic , I thought , would cause an uptick , maybe even a spike , in crime rates . Mayor Bill de Blasio , who made ending stop-and-frisk the centerpiece of his successful 2013 campaign for mayor , struck me as a man who was cynically willing to tolerate an increase in crime if he thought it to his political advantage to amplify leftist voters \u2019 core belief that policing was out of control . Today in New York City , use of stop-and-frisk , which the department justified via the 1968 Terry v. Ohio Supreme Court ruling , has crashed .
