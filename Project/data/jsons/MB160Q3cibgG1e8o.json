If you tried to parody the sad decline of prestige awards in those fields into an ideologically blinkered self-congratulatory echo chamber for progressive agitprop , it would be difficult to find a more on-the-nose example than the Pulitzer Prize awarded to Nikole Hannah-Jones of the New York Times for commentary . Hannah-Jones was , according to the Pulitzer committee , honored for \u201c a sweeping , deeply reported and personal essay for the ground-breaking 1619 Project , which seeks to place the enslavement of Africans at the center of America \u2019 s story , prompting public conversation about the nation \u2019 s founding and evolution . \u201d\n\u201c Deeply reported \u201d is one way to describe an essay that required the Times to append a correction and a separate \u201c Editor \u2019 s Note \u201d regarding an incendiary assertion that was presented without factual support , and that resulted in Hannah-Jones \u2019 s eventually admitting , after seven months of defending the claim , scrambling to find scholarly support for it , and bitterly denouncing her critics in racial terms , that \u201c in attempting to summarize and streamline , journalists can sometimes lose important context and nuance . I did that here. \u201d One hesitates to think what the runners-up for the award looked like .\nTechnically , the Pulitzer is for Hannah-Jones \u2019 s lead essay in the 1619 Project , and not for her role as the self-described architect of the rest of the essay collection . So , we can set aside the errors ranging from American political history to basic economics that plagued other submissions and focus on the lead essay .\nThe most dramatic and controversial assertion in Hannah-Jones \u2019 s essay was that , in 1776 , \u201c one of the primary reasons the colonists decided to declare their independence from Britain was because they wanted to protect the institution of slavery. \u201d Her essay cited nothing to support this , nor did it show even the slightest awareness of how radical a claim this is . She continued :\nBy 1776 , Britain had grown deeply conflicted over its role in the barbaric institution that had reshaped the Western Hemisphere . In London , there were growing calls to abolish the slave trade . This would have upended the economy of the colonies , in both the North and the South . . . we may never have revolted against Britain if some of the founders had not . . . believed that independence was required in order to ensure that slavery would continue .\nThis is ahistorical nonsense , which is why it was met almost instantly by a chorus of derision from the leading lights of the historical profession . It gets the chronology on both sides of the Atlantic wrong . While Hannah-Jones openly scoffs that there is \u201c no such thing \u201d as objective history , there are absolutely such things as objective facts . Dates are one of those .\nThe first real strike against slavery was the 1772 Somerset judicial decision in Britain , which declared that slavery was alien to the English common law and thus could not exist within Britain without a positive act of Parliament . As Princeton University history professor Sean Wilentz has noted , however , the reaction to the Somerset case , which did not apply to British colonies , was relatively muted even in the southern colonies ; it provoked nothing even vaguely resembling the furious responses to the Tea Act the following year . Most of the southern colonies had positive laws about slavery anyway ; Virginia \u2019 s , for example , was enacted by the House of Burgesses in 1705 .\nOrganized , popular movements against slavery , and laws restricting or abolishing slavery and the slave trade , were considerably more advanced in the American colonies in the 1770s than in Britain , where Parliament would not ban slavery in Jamaica and other British colonies until 1833 , after many years of failures by William Wilberforce and other anti-slavery leaders . The world \u2019 s first organized anti-slavery society was formed in Pennsylvania in 1774 , and the first legal ban on slavery anywhere in the world was in Vermont in 1777 . Five of the original 13 states followed suit either during or immediately after the Revolution , passing bans on slavery between 1780 and 1784 . The first federal ban on slavery , in the Northwest Territory , was drafted in 1784 by Thomas Jefferson and passed by the Confederation Congress in 1787 . Its language would later be adopted directly into the 13th Amendment .\nSlavery as such had died a natural death in Britain and most of Western and Central Europe over the ten centuries between the fall of Rome and the age of exploration , but Americans of the Founding generation were the first people in world history to set seriously about the business of killing it on principle . This in an age when , in the words of Seymour Drescher ( one of the leading historians of global slavery and abolition ) , \u201c personal bondage was the prevailing form of labor in most of the world . . . Freedom , not slavery , was the peculiar institution . \u201d\nBy contrast , anti-slavery agitation was still getting off the ground in Britain in 1775 and remained a long way from becoming a potent political force . Wilberforce himself would not even enter Parliament until 1780 and became a publicly committed anti-slavery advocate only in 1787 , the year Britain \u2019 s Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade was formed . Hannah-Jones cites the Constitution \u2019 s 20-year ban on Congress prohibiting the slave trade , but she leaves out three rather important facts : that multiple colonies and states legislated against the trade before and during the Revolution ; that Congress banned the trade at the first possible moment , in 1807 , at the insistence of President Jefferson ; and that Britain , with no such constitutional restriction , only got around to banning the slave trade the same year .\nThis is the tip of the iceberg ; the reality , known to anyone who has studied the period with any degree of intellectual honesty and curiosity , is that the rhetoric and ideals of revolutionary America were a major driving force in compelling people on both sides of the Atlantic to think about human liberty and how it could be reconciled with slavery and other forms of forced labor . The same dynamic happened in France , where anti-slavery went from the talk of a small intellectual elite to a matter of serious legislative debate only with the French Revolution . This is human nature : People want rights and liberties for themselves and their own , and only in the fighting for those things are they brought to face the question of why those same principles should not apply to everyone .\nIn order to paint the American Revolution as a fight to protect slavery from an anti-slavery Britain , you not only need to ignore the whole history of anti-slavery , you also must invert the chronology and geography of the Revolution . In reality , the Revolution began in Massachusetts , and the colonies with few slaves and early slavery bans were its most enthusiastic backers , while those with the most slaves tended to have the highest concentrations of Loyalists . Banastre Tarleton , the notorious leader of the Loyalist militia in North Carolina , was heir to a Liverpool slave-trading fortune and went on to a long career after the war as a vocal defender of the slave trade in Britain . Hannah-Jones \u2019 s alternative history also requires discarding the whole historical literature of the public and private arguments of the men who made the Revolution . Virtually none of them ever attempted \u2014 in speeches , in pamphlets , even in private letters \u2014 to convince anyone else to rebel to protect slavery .\nIt is telling in this regard that one of Hannah-Jones \u2019 s defenders , Adam Serwer of The Atlantic , entitled his essay on the controversy \u201c The Fight Over the 1619 Project Is Not About the Facts , \u201d and that Hannah-Jones cited as a \u201c brilliant analysis \u201d an essay from left-wing historian David Waldstreicher ( the only historian she named in her own essay ) saying that those taking Hannah-Jones \u2019 s view of the question of what motivated the American revolutionaries \u201c do not take for granted that the story is primarily one of uncovering the motives and beliefs of the founders. \u201d This is quite an admission , given that the entire debate is about Hannah-Jones \u2019 s claim about the \u201c primary \u201d motives and beliefs of the Founders .\nWaldstreicher takes the position of every conspiracy theorist : that the men who led the public debates over the momentous decision to separate from Britain were too embarrassed to mention in public or in private their real reasons , so that the absence of evidence is proof against them . But if you have read anything of the debates at the Constitutional Convention , or the 18th-century arguments over abolition in the northern states , or the rest of American politics between 1775 and 1861 , you know that American slaveowners were not shy about asserting their interests . We know that the states that seceded in 1860-61 did so over slavery because they said so . Slaveowners were horrified by the 1775 effort by Lord Dunsmore to raise a slave rebellion in Virginia , after the war had started , and said so . But virtually nobody argued that this had been the casus belli in the first place ; at most , it aggravated an existing breach that had already come to war . The chief self-interested cause of Virginia slaveowners such as George Washington was the opening of the Ohio Valley to settlement \u2014 and when they had secured that territory , they banned slavery from it .\nHannah-Jones \u2019 s invented history of the American Revolution attracted the most scholarly denunciation , but other parts of her Pulitzer-winning essay were misleading , at best , in their retelling of American history . She described slavery in the 13 colonies as \u201c unlike anything that had existed in the world before , \u201d but racial chattel plantation slavery existed in Haiti and the Spanish and Portuguese colonies before 1619 . In fact , she noted that the first slaves in 1619 were stolen from a Portuguese slave ship , but never asked where it was headed . She wrote of the Declaration of Independence , \u201c the white men who drafted those words did not believe them to be true for the hundreds of thousands of black people in their midst , \u201d ignoring the fact that two of the three men on the drafting committee ( John Adams and Benjamin Franklin ) were opposed to slavery . On the Constitution , relying on Waldstreicher , she offered half-truths :\nThat the Constitution \u201c protected the \u2018 property \u2019 of those who enslaved black people ; \u201d in fact , it protects property rights in general , but was specifically written to avoid giving explicit federal recognition to \u201c property in man , \u201d as detailed in Wilentz \u2019 s book No Property in Man . Instead , it pointedly refers to slaves as \u201c persons. \u201d Its only specific protection for ownership of slaves is the fugitive slave clause , with which Hannah-Jones takes separate issue .\nThat it \u201c allowed Congress to mobilize the militia to put down insurrections by the enslaved ; \u201d in fact , this power refers generally to any insurrection . It was invoked against the Whiskey Rebellion and against the Confederacy , and was cited by Congress as authority for the Militia Act of 1862 , which authorized the enlistment of \u201c persons of African descent . \u201d\nSpeaking of the civil-rights movement , she wrote : \u201c For the most part , black Americans fought back alone. \u201d Unlike the movements against slavery and the slave trade , in which free black Americans \u2014 while important voices \u2014 were too few and too powerless to be a driving force , African Americans took the starring role in the civil-rights movement in its crucial period between the mid 1940s and late 1960s . But never alone . Other Americans marched and , in some cases , died for civil rights . Branch Rickey hired Jackie Robinson . Harry Truman desegregated the Army . An all-white Supreme Court decided Brown v. Board of Education . Dwight Eisenhower sent federal troops to Little Rock . Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act , with bipartisan support from an almost entirely white House and an all-white Senate .\nHannah-Jones spent five paragraphs on Abraham Lincoln , dwelling entirely on an out-of-context quote from the 1858 Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates and a meeting in August 1862 when he proposed to black abolitionist leaders \u201c to ship black people , once freed , to another country. \u201d Contrary to the implication in that phrasing , Lincoln was proposing voluntary emigration , but more importantly , both his disclaimer of black equality in 1858 and his push for colonization in the summer of 1862 ( while a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation sat in his drawer ) were part of Lincoln \u2019 s political strategy to bring wavering whites over to the anti-slavery cause . It is fair enough to criticize Lincoln for a certain political cynicism , or for sharing some of the endemic prejudices of his age , but to paint the Great Emancipator \u2014 who was gunned down for supporting the vote for freed slaves \u2014 solely as an enemy of black liberty is not honest history at all . Worse , Hannah-Jones claimed that \u201c Lincoln was blaming [ black people ] for the war , \u201d which no fair-minded reader of the 16th president \u2019 s public statements from 1861 to 1865 could believe with a straight face .\nHannah-Jones \u2019 s essay , and the 1619 Project as a whole , were sharply criticized by a who \u2019 s who of America \u2019 s leading historians of the Revolution , the Founding era , and the Civil War , most of them political liberals . The World Socialist Web Site , a Trotskyist publication , did surprisingly good yeoman work in interviewing many of these scholars , among them :\nGordon Wood , professor emeritus at Brown University and perhaps the leading living scholar on the revolutionary era ;\nJames McPherson , professor emeritus of history at Princeton University and author of the preeminent single-volume history of the Civil War era ;\nJames Oakes , Distinguished Professor of History at the City University of New York , and a leading writer on abolitionism , Lincoln , and Frederick Douglass ;\nVictoria Bynum , distinguished emerita professor of history at Texas State University and a writer on the social history of the Civil War era ; and\nClayborne Carson , professor of history at Stanford University and director of its Martin Luther King , Jr. , Research and Education Institute , a job for which he was hand-picked by Coretta Scott King .\nThe interviews make brutal reading . Wood , McPherson , Wilentz , Oakes , and Bynum wrote an open letter to the Times \u201c as historians to express our strong reservations about important aspects of The 1619 Project. \u201d None of the scholarly critics argued against the idea of publishing a project on this topic , or disputed that some of its content was valuable . They took issue , instead , with its sloppy treatment of the facts : \u201c These errors , which concern major events , can not be described as interpretation or \u2018 framing. \u2019 They are matters of verifiable fact , which are the foundation of both honest scholarship and honest journalism . They suggest a displacement of historical understanding by ideology. \u201d They also noted how very few of the leading experts had been consulted by the Times . Noticeably , Princeton \u2019 s Kevin Kruse ( who contributed a piece to the 1619 Project on traffic in Atlanta and styles himself as the leader of \u201c Twitterstorians \u201d ) went rather silent on the controversy once the gray eminences of his own department weighed in .\nThe knee-jerk reaction by Hannah-Jones to historical criticism was to tweet , \u201c LOL . Right , because white historians have produced truly objective history. \u201d This was part of a general pattern of unserious and dismissive antics by Hannah-Jones , who calls herself the \u201c Beyonc\u00e9 of journalism. \u201d At some point , this should probably have given the Times pause in entrusting her with the paper \u2019 s good name . It is also a symptom of the toxic Twitter environment ; in a talk with Henry Louis Gates in December , she was less confrontational , admitting that Newt Gingrich and others had a valid point in asking why her history ignored white Northerners who fought against slavery in the Civil War .\nNew York Times Magazine editor in chief Jake Silverstein responded to the historians \u2019 letter with a long , mealy-mouthed response : \u201c Historical understanding is not fixed ; it is constantly being adjusted by new scholarship and new voices . Within the world of academic history , differing views exist , if not over what precisely happened , then about why it happened , who made it happen , how to interpret the motivations of historical actors and what it all means. \u201d Silverstein took the scholarly vivisection of Hannah-Jones \u2019 s work as proof of \u201c what we hoped our project would do : expand the reader \u2019 s sense of the American past . \u201d\nFinally , in March \u2014 seven months after publication \u2014 Politico published a whistleblowing essay by one of the 1619 Project \u2019 s fact-checkers , Northwestern professor Leslie Harris , taking issue with a number of things said in Hannah-Jones \u2019 s essay , and specifically observing that she had been asked to fact-check the most controversial passage and had her objections ignored :\nI vigorously disputed the claim . Although slavery was certainly an issue in the American Revolution , the protection of slavery was not one of the main reasons the 13 Colonies went to war . . . Far from being fought to preserve slavery , the Revolutionary War became a primary disrupter of slavery in the North American Colonies . . .\nThis , at last , compelled Hannah-Jones and the Times to make one correction to the essay , changing \u201c one of the primary reasons the colonists decided to declare their independence \u201d to \u201c one of the primary reasons some of the colonists decided to declare their independence. \u201d Hannah-Jones conceded , at last , that her original sentence had been devoid of context and nuance . Silverstein appended an \u201c Editor \u2019 s Note \u201d conceding that \u201c we recognize that our original language could be read to suggest that protecting slavery was a primary motivation for all of the colonists . The passage has been changed to make clear that this was a primary motivation for some of the colonists. \u201d Of course , in any popular movement , you can find somebody who believes a thing ; ascribing historical causation is supposed to aim rather higher than the search for a fig leaf .\nThe facts are , of course , the central thing \u2014 both the hard , provable facts and the broader narratives of causation , motivation , and effect that historians draw from them . It is apparent enough that Hannah-Jones dug in so hard on her particular claim about the American Revolution because she was wedded so deeply to the narrative that the 1776 founding of the nation could not be allowed to be regarded as a milestone in the idea of human liberty . That is why her essay gave her attack on the founding such prominent placement .\nIn public statements , Hannah-Jones has been open that her objective was agitprop : \u201c When my editor asks me , like , what \u2019 s your ultimate goal for the project , my ultimate goal is that there \u2019 ll be a reparations bill passed. \u201d \u201c I write to try to get liberal white people to do what they say they believe in . I \u2019 m making a moral argument . My method is guilt . \u201d\nAs for her employer , Slate published a transcript of a town-hall meeting held by Times executive editor Dean Baquet in August 2019 , in which he responded to a staffer asking\nto what extent you think that the fact of racism and white supremacy being sort of the foundation of this country should play into our reporting . Just because it feels to me like it should be a starting point , you know ? . . . I just feel like racism is in everything . It should be considered in our science reporting , in our culture reporting , in our national reporting .\nBaquet pointed , in his response , to the 1619 Project : \u201c I do think that race and understanding of race should be a part of how we cover the American story . . . one reason we all signed off on the 1619 Project and made it so ambitious and expansive was to teach our readers to think a little bit more like that . \u201d\nAs for the Pulitzer committee , which is run through Columbia University and ( predictably ) includes Gail Collins of the Times , one way to pitch a piece of journalism as Pulitzer-worthy is to have it embraced by the ( unaffiliated ) Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting . At the time of the 1619 Project \u2019 s publication in August 2019 , the Pulitzer Center issued a press release touting its pride in its educational arm being \u201c selected as the education partner \u201d by the Times to create a school curriculum out of the 1619 Project , complete with a glowing quote from the head of the Pulitzer Center :\n\u201c We are honored to have the opportunity to work with The New York Times on this landmark initiative , \u201d said Jon Sawyer , executive director of the Pulitzer Center . \u201c The education network we have built over the past 13 years is premised on the belief that journalism can be the engine for public education and civil discourse . It is hard to imagine a topic more resonant , or more important , than \u2018 The 1619 Project. \u2019 \u201d . . . Hannah-Jones and other contributors to the \u2018 1619 \u2019 issue will visit Pulitzer Center partner schools in the coming months . A schedule of public speaking appearances by Hannah-Jones and other \u2018 1619 \u2019 contributors will appear on the Center \u2019 s events page when available .\nOn August 13 \u2014 the day before publication \u2014 the Times held a live rollout event , at which Silverstein \u201c thanked the Pulitzer Center and . . . mentioned the sheet in the [ Times ] magazine highlighting the Pulitzer Center \u2019 s education materials. \u201d In September , the Chicago Public Schools announced : \u201c Thanks to our partners at the Pulitzer Center , every CPS high school will receive 200\u2013400 copies of the New York Times \u2019 The 1619 Project this week as a resource to help reframe the institution of slavery , and how we \u2019 re still influenced by it today. \u201d In October , \u201c Pulitzer Center staff ventured to high schools and colleges in Illinois and North Carolina \u201d to promote this initiative .\nYou know , and I know , and everybody else on this planet knows , that nothing full of as many shoddy errors and untruths , and subject to such withering scholarly rebuttal , as the 1619 Project would be awarded an accolade such as a Pulitzer if its politics were of the right rather than of the left . Nor , for that matter , would the Times devote such effort to defending an assertion as outlandish as Hannah-Jones \u2019 s view of the American Revolution unless it had strong ideological and institutional reasons to be wedded to the argument . Maybe this deserves a prize , but not one for honest history .",

The chief self-interested cause of Virginia slaveowners such as George Washington was the opening of the Ohio Valley to settlement \u2014 and when they had secured that territory, they banned slavery from it.\n\nAfter 1776\n\nHannah-Jones\u2019s invented history of the American Revolution attracted the most scholarly denunciation, but other parts of her Pulitzer-winning essay were misleading, at best, in their retelling of American history. She described slavery in the 13 colonies as \u201cunlike anything that had existed in the world before,\u201d but racial chattel plantation slavery existed in Haiti and the Spanish and Portuguese colonies before 1619. In fact, she noted that the first slaves in 1619 were stolen from a Portuguese slave ship, but never asked where it was headed. She wrote of the Declaration of Independence, \u201cthe white men who drafted those words did not believe them to be true for the hundreds of thousands of black people in their midst,\u201d ignoring the fact that two of the three men on the drafting committee (John Adams and Benjamin Franklin) were opposed to slavery. On the Constitution, relying on Waldstreicher, she offered half-truths:\n\nThat the Constitution \u201cprotected the \u2018property\u2019 of those who enslaved black people;\u201d in fact, it protects property rights in general, but was specifically written to avoid giving explicit federal recognition to \u201cproperty in man,\u201d as detailed in Wilentz\u2019s book No Property in Man. Instead, it pointedly refers to slaves as \u201cpersons.\u201d Its only specific protection for ownership of slaves is the fugitive slave clause, with which Hannah-Jones takes separate issue.\n\nThat it \u201callowed Congress to mobilize the militia to put down insurrections by the enslaved;\u201d in fact, this power refers generally to any insurrection. It was invoked against the Whiskey Rebellion and against the Confederacy, and was cited by Congress as authority for the Militia Act of 1862, which authorized the enlistment of \u201cpersons of African descent.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of the civil-rights movement, she wrote: \u201cFor the most part, black Americans fought back alone.\u201d Unlike the movements against slavery and the slave trade, in which free black Americans \u2014 while important voices \u2014 were too few and too powerless to be a driving force, African Americans took the starring role in the civil-rights movement in its crucial period between the mid 1940s and late 1960s. But never alone. Other Americans marched and, in some cases, died for civil rights. Branch Rickey hired Jackie Robinson. Harry Truman desegregated the Army. An all-white Supreme Court decided Brown v. Board of Education. Dwight Eisenhower sent federal troops to Little Rock. Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, with bipartisan support from an almost entirely white House and an all-white Senate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHannah-Jones spent five paragraphs on Abraham Lincoln, dwelling entirely on an out-of-context quote from the 1858 Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates and a meeting in August 1862 when he proposed to black abolitionist leaders \u201cto ship black people, once freed, to another country.\u201d Contrary to the implication in that phrasing, Lincoln was proposing voluntary emigration, but more importantly, both his disclaimer of black equality in 1858 and his push for colonization in the summer of 1862 (while a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation sat in his drawer) were part of Lincoln\u2019s political strategy to bring wavering whites over to the anti-slavery cause. It is fair enough to criticize Lincoln for a certain political cynicism, or for sharing some of the endemic prejudices of his age, but to paint the Great Emancipator \u2014 who was gunned down for supporting the vote for freed slaves \u2014 solely as an enemy of black liberty is not honest history at all. Worse, Hannah-Jones claimed that \u201cLincoln was blaming [black people] for the war,\u201d which no fair-minded reader of the 16th president\u2019s public statements from 1861 to 1865 could believe with a straight face.\n\nThe First Rule of Holes\n\nHannah-Jones\u2019s essay, and the 1619 Project as a whole, were sharply criticized by a who\u2019s who of America\u2019s leading historians of the Revolution, the Founding era, and the Civil War, most of them political liberals. The World Socialist Web Site, a Trotskyist publication, did surprisingly good yeoman work in interviewing many of these scholars, among them:\n\nGordon Wood, professor emeritus at Brown University and perhaps the leading living scholar on the revolutionary era;\n\nJames McPherson, professor emeritus of history at Princeton University and author of the preeminent single-volume history of the Civil War era;\n\nJames Oakes, Distinguished Professor of History at the City University of New York, and a leading writer on abolitionism, Lincoln, and Frederick Douglass;\n\nVictoria Bynum, distinguished emerita professor of history at Texas State University and a writer on the social history of the Civil War era; and\n\nClayborne Carson, professor of history at Stanford University and director of its Martin Luther King, Jr., Research and Education Institute, a job for which he was hand-picked by Coretta Scott King.\n\nThe interviews make brutal reading. Wood, McPherson, Wilentz, Oakes, and Bynum wrote an open letter to the Times \u201cas historians to express our strong reservations about important aspects of The 1619 Project.\u201d None of the scholarly critics argued against the idea of publishing a project on this topic, or disputed that some of its content was valuable. They took issue, instead, with its sloppy treatment of the facts: \u201cThese errors, which concern major events, cannot be described as interpretation or \u2018framing.\u2019 They are matters of verifiable fact, which are the foundation of both honest scholarship and honest journalism. They suggest a displacement of historical understanding by ideology.\u201d They also noted how very few of the leading experts had been consulted by the Times. Noticeably, Princeton\u2019s Kevin Kruse (who contributed a piece to the 1619 Project on traffic in Atlanta and styles himself as the leader of \u201cTwitterstorians\u201d) went rather silent on the controversy once the gray eminences of his own department weighed in.\n\nThe knee-jerk reaction by Hannah-Jones to historical criticism was to tweet, \u201cLOL. Right, because white historians have produced truly objective history.\u201d This was part of a general pattern of unserious and dismissive antics by Hannah-Jones, who calls herself the \u201cBeyonc\u00e9 of journalism.\u201d At some point, this should probably have given the Times pause in entrusting her with the paper\u2019s good name. It is also a symptom of the toxic Twitter environment; in a talk with Henry Louis Gates in December, she was less confrontational, admitting that Newt Gingrich and others had a valid point in asking why her history ignored white Northerners who fought against slavery in the Civil War.\n\nNew York Times Magazine editor in chief Jake Silverstein responded to the historians\u2019 letter with a long, mealy-mouthed response: \u201cHistorical understanding is not fixed; it is constantly being adjusted by new scholarship and new voices. Within the world of academic history, differing views exist, if not over what precisely happened, then about why it happened, who made it happen, how to interpret the motivations of historical actors and what it all means.\u201d Silverstein took the scholarly vivisection of Hannah-Jones\u2019s work as proof of \u201cwhat we hoped our project would do: expand the reader\u2019s sense of the American past.\u201d\n\nFinally, in March \u2014 seven months after publication \u2014 Politico published a whistleblowing essay by one of the 1619 Project\u2019s fact-checkers, Northwestern professor Leslie Harris, taking issue with a number of things said in Hannah-Jones\u2019s essay, and specifically observing that she had been asked to fact-check the most controversial passage and had her objections ignored:\n\nI vigorously disputed the claim. Although slavery was certainly an issue in the American Revolution, the protection of slavery was not one of the main reasons the 13 Colonies went to war . . . Far from being fought to preserve slavery, the Revolutionary War became a primary disrupter of slavery in the North American Colonies . . .\n\nThis, at last, compelled Hannah-Jones and the Times to make one correction to the essay, changing \u201cone of the primary reasons the colonists decided to declare their independence\u201d to \u201cone of the primary reasons some of the colonists decided to declare their independence.\u201d Hannah-Jones conceded, at last, that her original sentence had been devoid of context and nuance. Silverstein appended an \u201cEditor\u2019s Note\u201d conceding that \u201cwe recognize that our original language could be read to suggest that protecting slavery was a primary motivation for all of the colonists. The passage has been changed to make clear that this was a primary motivation for some of the colonists.\u201d Of course, in any popular movement, you can find somebody who believes a thing; ascribing historical causation is supposed to aim rather higher than the search for a fig leaf.\n\nWhy They Dug In\n\nThe facts are, of course, the central thing \u2014 both the hard, provable facts and the broader narratives of causation, motivation, and effect that historians draw from them. It is apparent enough that Hannah-Jones dug in so hard on her particular claim about the American Revolution because she was wedded so deeply to the narrative that the 1776 founding of the nation could not be allowed to be regarded as a milestone in the idea of human liberty. That is why her essay gave her attack on the founding such prominent placement.\n\nIn public statements, Hannah-Jones has been open that her objective was agitprop: \u201cWhen my editor asks me, like, what\u2019s your ultimate goal for the project, my ultimate goal is that there\u2019ll be a reparations bill passed.\u201d \u201cI write to try to get liberal white people to do what they say they believe in. I\u2019m making a moral argument. My method is guilt.\u201d\n\nAs for her employer, Slate published a transcript of a town-hall meeting held by Times executive editor Dean Baquet in August 2019, in which he responded to a staffer asking\n\nto what extent you think that the fact of racism and white supremacy being sort of the foundation of this country should play into our reporting. Just because it feels to me like it should be a starting point, you know? . . . I just feel like racism is in everything. It should be considered in our science reporting, in our culture reporting, in our national reporting.\n\nBaquet pointed, in his response, to the 1619 Project: \u201cI do think that race and understanding of race should be a part of how we cover the American story . . . one reason we all signed off on the 1619 Project and made it so ambitious and expansive was to teach our readers to think a little bit more like that.\u201d\n\nAs for the Pulitzer committee, which is run through Columbia University and (predictably) includes Gail Collins of the Times, one way to pitch a piece of journalism as Pulitzer-worthy is to have it embraced by the (unaffiliated) Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting. At the time of the 1619 Project\u2019s publication in August 2019, the Pulitzer Center issued a press release touting its pride in its educational arm being \u201cselected as the education partner\u201d by the Times to create a school curriculum out of the 1619 Project, complete with a glowing quote from the head of the Pulitzer Center:\n\n\u201cWe are honored to have the opportunity to work with The New York Times on this landmark initiative,\u201d said Jon Sawyer, executive director of the Pulitzer Center. \u201cThe education network we have built over the past 13 years is premised on the belief that journalism can be the engine for public education and civil discourse. It is hard to imagine a topic more resonant, or more important, than \u2018The 1619 Project.\u2019\u201d . . . Hannah-Jones and other contributors to the \u20181619\u2019 issue will visit Pulitzer Center partner schools in the coming months. A schedule of public speaking appearances by Hannah-Jones and other \u20181619\u2019 contributors will appear on the Center\u2019s events page when available.\n\nOn August 13 \u2014 the day before publication \u2014 the Times held a live rollout event, at which Silverstein \u201cthanked the Pulitzer Center and . . . mentioned the sheet in the [Times] magazine highlighting the Pulitzer Center\u2019s education materials.\u201d In September, the Chicago Public Schools announced: \u201cThanks to our partners at the Pulitzer Center, every CPS high school will receive 200\u2013400 copies of the New York Times\u2019 The 1619 Project this week as a resource to help reframe the institution of slavery, and how we\u2019re still influenced by it today.\u201d In October, \u201cPulitzer Center staff ventured to high schools and colleges in Illinois and North Carolina\u201d to promote this initiative.\n\nYou know, and I know, and everybody else on this planet knows, that nothing full of as many shoddy errors and untruths, and subject to such withering scholarly rebuttal, as the 1619 Project would be awarded an accolade such as a Pulitzer if its politics were of the right rather than of the left. Nor, for that matter, would the Times devote such effort to defending an assertion as outlandish as Hannah-Jones\u2019s view of the American Revolution unless it had strong ideological and institutional reasons to be wedded to the argument. Maybe this deserves a prize, but not one for honest history.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: This article originally suggested that the Pulitzer Center is affiliated with the Pulitzer Prizes.
