''\nBut another congressional voice , Florida Sen. Marco Rubio , criticized the administration for not taking action sooner .\n`` That it took so long for the administration to arrive at this conclusion , in the face of unspeakable human suffering , defies explanation , '' Rubio , who until Tuesday was a GOP presidential candidate , said in a statement . `` At long last the United States is no longer silent in the face of this evil , but it would be travesty if we were to mistakenly take solace in this designation , if the designation did not then yield some sort of action .
