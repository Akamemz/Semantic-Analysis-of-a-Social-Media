Rand Paul , who has been in a bit of a tiff recently with the Clintons , says that any Democrat who has raised campaign money with former President Clinton should return the cash to protest his sexual behavior in the White House .\nSpeaking on C-SPAN \u2019 s \u201c Newsmakers \u201d program , in an interview airing Sunday , Mr. Paul said Democrats are being hypocritical by criticizing Republicans as waging a war on women while at the same time embracing Mr. Clinton , who was impeached for lying about a sexual relationship with a White House intern .\n\u201c They can \u2019 t have it both ways . And so I really think that anybody who wants to take money from Bill Clinton or have a fundraiser has a lot of explaining to do . In fact , I think they should give the money back , \u201d Mr. Paul , Kentucky Republican , said . \u201c If they want to take position on women \u2019 s rights , by all means do . But you can \u2019 t do it and take it from a guy who was using his position of authority to take advantage of young women in the workplace . \u201d\nMr. Paul recently called Mr. Clinton a \u201c sexual predator \u201d for his relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky .\nThe House voted to impeach Mr. Clinton in 1998 , making him the second president in history to face such a dishonor . The Senate voted not to convict him .\nMr. Clinton remains popular with Democratic voters , and even attended a Senate Democratic retreat this week to talk policy and strategy . And he remains a popular fundraiser on the campaign trail .\nSome Democrats have sprung to the Clintons \u2019 defense , including Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri , who said it was \u201c infuriating \u201d for Mr. Paul to cite Mr. Clinton as a response to the GOP \u2019 s policies toward women . She also said it was unfair to tarnish Hillary Rodham Clinton , who is pondering whether to run for president in 2016 , with the actions of her husband .\n\u201c I think most women understand that they should not be held accountable for the behaviors of their husbands .
