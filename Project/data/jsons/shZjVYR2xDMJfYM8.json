Jim DeMint , who is now president of the conservative Heritage Foundation , the deal reached in Vienna Tuesday \u201c completely fails to cut off Iran \u2019 s path to nuclear weaponry \u201d \u2013 and thus leaves the world \u201c a much more dangerous place . \u201d\nIran \u2019 s path to the bomb is cut off , or left wide open ; the world is safer , or much less secure \u2013 which is it ?\nThe answer appears to be somewhere in between , according to some former administration officials and nuclear experts who have begun poring over the 100-plus pages that make up the most technical and detailed accord ever reached for limiting a country \u2019 s nuclear development .\nThe deal will very likely prohibit Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon for the next decade or more \u2013 but for critics who wanted to see Iran stripped of all nuclear capability , that is hardly a win for the world . The deal does not grant Iran the sanctions relief it craves until it begins complying with the agreement \u2019 s obligations \u2013 but for critics , that will still leave Iran with a windfall to do its regional mischief .\nWhile many experts see both strengths and weaknesses in the accord , most agree that the real test will be in the years of implementation \u2013 and that , as difficult as the nearly two years of negotiating may have been , the hard part is still to come .\n\u201c I \u2019 m pleasantly surprised by the amount of detail in the deal \u201d that \u201c confirms the positive elements in the Lausanne framework \u201d agreement that was reached in April , says Robert Einhorn , a former State Department adviser on nuclear issues . The deal \u201c strengthens in a number of ways \u201d the measures agreed to in the framework , he says .\nThe deal meets the five key \u201c requirements \u201d that a group of former Obama administration officials and other experts laid out last month for supporting a comprehensive agreement , says Mr. Einhorn , who is a senior fellow in the Brookings Institution \u2019 s Arms Control and Non-Proliferation Initiative in Washington .\nEinhorn was part of the bipartisan group that in late June sent a letter to Mr. Obama expressing concern that the United States , in the interest of getting a deal , was weakening its demands on issues ranging from inspections of Iran \u2019 s military sites to the timing of sanctions relief .\nHowever , measures that Iran has committed to will extend its \u201c breakout \u201d time for acquiring a nuclear weapon from two to three months currently to at least a year for a decade or more , Einhorn says .\nExperts are less pleased that the breakout time would start to shrink after a decade of the accord .
