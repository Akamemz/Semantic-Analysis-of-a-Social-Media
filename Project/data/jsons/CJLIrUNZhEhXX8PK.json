The latest poll numbers in key battleground states show Mr. Trump losing to former Vice President Joe Biden .\nIn a fundamental way , Mr. Trump is also tapping into the nation \u2019 s deep roots in individualism and personal responsibility , as well as the right 's growing distrust of experts and elites .\n\u201c He \u2019 s been very good at building a base , which is very loyal to him , and continuing to remind the base he \u2019 s on their side , \u201d says historian Michael Kazin , an expert on populism at Georgetown University . \u201c As the economy gets worse , more and more people will say that while the virus might be dangerous , it \u2019 s also dangerous to have businesses close up for good . \u201d\nThe political challenges are several fold .
