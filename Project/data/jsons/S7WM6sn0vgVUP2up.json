They \u2019 re just as upset about what Benjamin Netanyahu said ruling out a two-state solution , but President Barack Obama didn \u2019 t need to keep reminding them and everyone else .\nObama and his aides , they said , had to stop acting as if the Israeli prime minister \u2019 s comments are the only thing holding up a peace process that \u2019 s been abandoned for a year while not expressing a word of disappointment about Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas \u2014 and openly toying with allowing the Palestinians their provocative recognition bid at the United Nations . The swipes at Netanyahu felt vindictive , and gratuitous .\nThe White House has worked to cool down the rhetoric and public tension . But it \u2019 s not letting go . When Netanyahu insisted during the congratulatory phone call Obama waited to make that he was already backtracking and they \u2019 d get past this , an unimpressed Obama responded by saying , sure , but you said what you said . He and his aides believe it \u2019 s now up to Netanyahu to repair a rift that they stress is only about the peace process , not the larger commitment to Israel .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve made our point .

They \u2019 ve gone very public with their complaint about Netanyahu in the two weeks since as they \u2019 ve internalized that he really will be the Israeli leader for Obama \u2019 s whole presidency , years of animosity brought to a boil by a speech to Congress that was unprecedented in having a foreign leader attack White House policy from the House floor .\nBoth Obama and Netanyahu seem to think they \u2019 re winning .
