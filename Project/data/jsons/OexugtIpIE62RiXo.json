With this clear repudiation behind him and a Republican House majority suddenly standing before him, Mr. Obama was handed an opportunity to adjust course and reclaim the confidence of the American electorate. Instead, he took a different approach: If you can\u2019t lead \u2018em, ignore \u2018em. President Obama set himself against the expressed will of the American people and resolved to end-run and overrun their elected representatives. So began the imperial presidency.\n\nAs a conservative freshman in Congress, one expects policy disagreements with a liberal president.
