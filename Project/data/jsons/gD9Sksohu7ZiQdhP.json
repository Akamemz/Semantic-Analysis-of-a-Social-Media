    "content": "Jeb Bush \u2019 s latest effort to court evangelical voters boomeranged when a Christian radio network boss challenged him for hiring two political aides who support same-sex marriage , and the former Florida governor conceded that he couldn \u2019 t identify any \u201c genuine \u201d conservatives in his inner circle .\nThe details of Mr. Bush \u2019 s private phone call in mid-April with Rich Bott , whose religious radio network of 100 stations stretches from California to Tennessee within potential reach of 51 million listeners , were confirmed to The \u2588\u2588\u2588 by Mr. Bott and top aides to Mr. Bush .\nIt is the latest bellwether of the former Florida governor \u2019 s struggles with certain constituencies inside the Republican Party \u2019 s conservative base who are wary of his potential positioning on marriage , education , immigration and spending heading into his bid for the White House .\n\u201c Who can you name in your campaign or administration that is a genuine movement conservative ? \u201d Mr. Bott asked during the call .\n\u201c You know , I don \u2019 t know who is a movement conservative these days because it \u2019 s all so mainstream , \u201d Mr. Bush replied , according to Mr. Bott .\nMovement conservatives say that has been a problem since Ronald Reagan made conservatism fashionable in the 1980s . Almost all Republicans since then claim to be conservative even if they can \u2019 t define the word or don \u2019 t necessarily like its meaning .\nLikewise , Mr. Bott said he challenged Mr. Bush for hiring two proponents of same-sex marriage inside the political machine that is helping him explore a bid for the Republican nomination for president next year .\n\u201c When Gov . Bush called me that morning on April 17 , I figured he was reaching out to a number evangelical Christian leaders across the country , \u201d Mr. Bott told The Times in an interview . \u201c I expressed appreciation for his and his family \u2019 s commitment to public service .\n\u201c But told him I find it incomprehensible how you could have these people at the top of your campaign and not expect them to influence policies going forward , \u201d Mr. Bott said . \u201c Gov . Bush replied , \u2018 I don \u2019 t ask questions about their sexuality . \u2019 \u201d\nBush spokeswoman Kristi Campbell did not dispute Mr. Bott \u2019 s account of the call . She said her boss \u201c is committed to picking the best individuals for his team . He has never discriminated in the past and is not going to start now . \u201d\nShe said , \u201c Gov . Bush \u2019 s position on gay marriage is clear . If he goes with a run , it will be premised on his agenda , not anyone else \u2019 s . \u201d\nGordon Sekulow , the evangelical senior adviser to Mr. Bush \u2019 s Right to Rise PAC , noted that in South Carolina on Saturday , Mr. Bush had \u201c breakfast with nearly 40 pastors and faith leaders and earlier in the week spent time with conservative faith leaders in Texas . \u201d\n\u201c As these conversations continue , Gov . Bush is committed to protecting the religious liberty in America and promoting religious freedom abroad , \u201d Mr. Sekulow said .\nAt the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington in February , Sean Hannity asked Mr. Bush whether he had changed his position on same-sex marriage .\n\u201c No , I believe in traditional marriage , \u201d Mr. Bush responded . He has not , however , said he opposes recognition of same-sex marriage as a constitutional right .\nMr. Bush earned high marks from conservatives of all stripes during his gubernatorial terms for his stands on economic and social issues . Mr. Bott and other evangelicals praised him for siding with Terri Schiavo \u2019 s brother and parents in wanting to prolong her life support in the famous right-to-life case a decade ago .\nBut Mr. Bush \u2019 s relations with evangelical voters have grown strained since , in part because of comments he has made since re-entering the private sector .\nThat poses a challenge for him given that more than half the voters who choose the Republican presidential nominee in state primary elections and caucuses next year are likely to be born-again Christians , based on exit poling of previous election cycles .\n\u201c I \u2019 m ready to rule out anybody who \u2019 s hiring a bunch of staff members who have a same-sex marriage agenda , \u201d Jerry A. Johnson , president of the National Religious Broadcasters , said of the field of Republican presidential candidates .\nIowa Republican and evangelical activist Bob Vander Plaats said he wouldn \u2019 t comment on Mr. Bush specifically but that he agreed with Mr. Bott .\n\u201c Rich is right , \u201d he said . \u201c We value three things in candidates : character , meaning what you say ; competency , knowing how to carry out what you promise ; and company , you reveal who you are by the people you surround yourself with , the company you keep . \u201d\n\u201c If a candidate hires or appoints people who are not like-minded with him or her on basic moral issues , it raises huge red flags , \u201d Mr. Vander Plaats said .\nMr. Bott said it \u2019 s \u201c hard to imagine evangelicals being excited about a Bush candidacy if he has well-known advocates of homosexual marriage leading his campaign . \u201d\nMr. Bush is on record as opposing same-sex marriage but hired David Kochel to run his campaign organization when it becomes official . He also hired Tim Miller to be the communications director of the campaign when it gets underway , presumably later this spring .\nMr. Kochel and Mr. Miller publicly advocate same-sex marriage , arguing that it should be guaranteed under the Constitution .\nMr. Bush , 62 , is five years younger than Hillary Rodham Clinton , the top candidate for the Democratic nomination who says same-sex marriage is a right afforded by the Constitution . He will be competing with a bevy of contenders out to win evangelical voters \u2019 affection or at least acceptance .\nMr. Bush has said he supports traditional marriage but respects those who want to marry people of their own sex .\nWhat rankles many evangelicals is that Mr. Bush \u2019 s brother , George W.
