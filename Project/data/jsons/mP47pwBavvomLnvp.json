In particular, Camp\u2019s one-time tax is smaller, at 5.25 percent. And Camp uses that revenue to make the permanent international tax system more generous for companies than Baucus does.\n\nSenator John Thune of South Dakota said he prefers Camp\u2019s approach.\n\n\u201cI want to see a territorial system, and I want to see a system that encourages people to to keep jobs in this country and to keep investment in this country,\u201d said Thune, a Finance Committee member who is the third-ranking Republican in the Senate. \u201cAnd I think today we don\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nAdded Tax\n\nOther features in Baucus\u2019s draft include imposing immediate U.S. taxes on almost all income earned by companies from sales to U.S. customers.\n\nIt eliminates the so-called check-the-box rule that companies can use to have the Internal Revenue Service disregard some foreign subsidiaries for tax purposes.\n\nBaucus is seeking comments from companies and senators by Jan. 17.\n\nSenator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the top Republican on the Finance Committee, said he disagreed with Baucus\u2019s decision to release the drafts while Democrats are proposing tax increases in a budget conference committee.\n\n\u201cMy staff worked alongside the chairman\u2019s for months, but the fact is that significant policy differences remain between both sides and a final agreement was never reached,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cI hope that once the budget conference negotiations have concluded that we can renew our discussions.\u201d",
