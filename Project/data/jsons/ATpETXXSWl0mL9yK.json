Some place ballot-collection boxes in high-concentration voter areas , such as college campuses , and take the ballots to election offices when the boxes are full .\nIn North Carolina , election officials are investigating whether Republican political operatives in parts of the 9th Congressional District harvested ballots from minority voters and didn \u2019 t deliver them to the election offices . In some cases they are accused of harvesting ballots that were not sealed and only partially filled out . Ballot harvesting is illegal under state law , which allows only a family member or legal guardian to drop off absentee ballots for a voter .\nInvestigators are focusing on areas in the district where an unusually high number of absentee ballots were not returned .
