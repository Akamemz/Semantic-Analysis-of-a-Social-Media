    "content": "News outlets began declaring Karen Handel the winner of Georgia 's 6th District U.S. House seat at roughly 10 p.m. Tuesday evening , three hours after most polls closed here in the north Atlanta suburbs . She will become the first woman to represent the Peach State in Congress since Democrat Cynthia McKinney lost her reelection bid 11 years ago .\nHandel 's hard-fought victory over Democrat Jon Ossoff came amid a deluge of outside money and attention . The race was being viewed nationally as a key test of President Donald Trump 's popularity among GOP voters , the Republican health care overhaul and the left 's nascent resistance movement . And the vote , as of 11:15 p.m. Tuesday night , was not as close as some had anticipated .\nRead our condensed takeout of the race here . For full coverage , check out our live blog below and redesigned myAJC politics page .\nUpdated at 12:05 a.m. -- Trump calls to congratulate Handel\nKaren Handel was on the phone with our colleague Kyle Wingfield tonight when she had to quickly answer a call on the other line . Turned out it was President Donald Trump .\n\u201c He wished me well , said it was a great campaign , that he was very proud of me , '' she later told Wingfield . `` He said he knew I was going to win . I \u2019 m glad I did . \u201d\nWhen Trump visited the 6th District and campaigned for Handel back in April , he famously told her she 'd `` better win . '' Recounting that comment on Tuesday , Handel chuckled and jokingly added , \u201c I \u2019 m not sure what the consequences would be if you did not meet the president \u2019 s expectations . \u201d\nUpdated at 11:05 p.m. -- A final thought on today 's turnout\nKristina Torres , the AJC 's point person on Georgia 's voting trends , sent along this take putting tonight 's final vote tally in perspective :\nSixth District voters turned out in unprecedented numbers Tuesday for their runoff , but it takes a step back to appreciate by just how much . We already knew that while typical turnout during off-year special elections is notoriously low , Georgia \u2019 s 6th District special election on April 18 ( which decided who was in Tuesday \u2019 s runoff ) topped 37 percent \u2014 nearly 194,000 people voted . But Tuesday \u2019 s unofficial ballot count topped 241,500 . That \u2019 s more than the 210,000 votes cast in the district in 2014 \u2013 putting the contest squarely in common with midterm contests , not special elections . Many had predicted a 210,000-plus turnout , although few were sure how high it would go . One of those who got it right was Mark Rountree , the president of Landmark Communications , who predicted an overall turnout of 235,000 to 240,000 voters \u2014 with a majority having voted early ( and that \u2019 s what happened ) . The 6th District itself has long been considered highly motivated . In that sense , turnout percentage-wise didn \u2019 t disappoint . In a district with about 526,000 registered voters in all , nearly half of them came out : Unofficial turnout stood at about 46 percent in the race .\nOur colleague Mark Niesse , who 's been posted up at Handel 's watch party tonight , sent along this report describing the jubilant scene at the Hyatt Regency in Dunwoody :\nRepublican Karen Handel celebrated her win over Democrat Jon Ossoff on Tuesday to a crowd chanting \u201c Karen , Karen , Karen \u201d as she heads to Congress to represent Atlanta \u2019 s northern suburbs . \u201c This was going to be a very , very tight race , it was going to be contentious , and it was going to require all hands on deck , and that \u2019 s exactly what we had , \u201d Handel said . Handel thanked President Donald Trump and other prominent Republicans who supported her in the nationally-watched runoff , leading to cheers of \u201c Trump , Trump , Trump \u201d from the crowd . ... She said Ossoff was gracious when he called her to concede . \u201c We may have some different beliefs , but we are part of one community , the community of the 6th District , '' she said . \u201c My pledge is to be part of the solution to focus on governing , to put my experience to work to help solve the very serious issues we \u2019 re facing in this country . \u201d\nThe president had been silent for most of the day Tuesday while 6th District residents hit the polls , but Donald Trump was quick to congratulate Republican Karen Handel on Twitter after she defeated Democrat Jon Ossoff .\nThe president also thanked Fox News for saying that Handel 's victory represented a `` huge win '' for Trump and the GOP .\nDemocrat Jon Ossoff conceded to Republican Karen Handel in the hard-fought race to represent Georgia \u2019 s 6th District , ending a defiant address to hundreds of disappointed supporters with a pledge that the \u201c fight goes on . \u201d\nOssoff , a 30-year-old former congressional aide , shattered fundraising records and became a national Democratic rising star with his bid to flip the suburban Atlanta district . But Handel staved off his fierce challenge by consolidating GOP support across the district .\nThe Democrat said little about his political future \u2013 namely whether he would seek to challenge Handel next year \u2013 in a brief address to supporters . He has said repeatedly he would have to talk with his fianc\u00e9e before deciding about another political run .\nBut his speech suggested he would not stray far from the political spotlight . He thanks his supporters for providing a \u201c beacon of hope for people in Georgia. \u201d And he said his campaign \u201c showed the world that in places where no one thought it was even possible to fight , we could fight . \u201d\n\u201c This is not the outcome any of us would hope for , \u201d said Ossoff . \u201c But this is the beginning of something much bigger than us . So thank you \u2013 thank you for the most extraordinary experience that I \u2019 ve ever had the honor of being a part of . \u201d\nDemocrat Jon Ossoff called Republican Karen Handel around 10:15 p.m. on Tuesday night to concede the race , his campaign said . He is expected to speak to his crowd of supporters shortly , bringing the race to an earlier than expected end .\nRepublicans from D.C. to Marietta cheered Karen Handel after she was declared the victor in Tuesday 's 6th District special election .\n`` Things are looking great for Karen H ! '' President Donald Trump tweeted roughly 20 minutes after the race was called :\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan congratulated Handel for a `` hard-earned and well-deserved victory . ''\n\u201c Democrats from coast to coast threw everything they had at this race , and Karen would not be defeated , '' the Wisconsin Republican said in a statement .\nRepublican Gov . Nathan Deal , who campaigned for Handel on Monday , also tweeted his congratulations :\nU.S. Rep. Doug Collins , R-Gainesville , said Tuesday 's results say `` exactly what we knew about this district . ''\n\u201c It \u2019 s a conservative district . And if you \u2019 re a Democrat who spent as much money as they did , and barely got what Hillary Clinton got , it says the district was not for sale , \u201d Collins said . \u201c And after a $ 30 million onslaught , the district saw through it . \u201d\nCollins said expects Handel to face a stiff challenge in 2018 , whether from Ossoff or another contender .\n\u201c But Karen Handel , as an incumbent with a record of support , will win again , \u201d he said . \u201c In the last three months , we \u2019 ve had three moral victories from Democrats \u2013 and no wins . \u201d\nState Rep. Betty Price said she \u2019 s excited that Handel will succeed the congressional seat that was previously held by her husband , Tom Price , who is now President Donald Trump \u2019 s health secretary .\n\u201c It \u2019 s probably not unexpected , \u201d Price said of the result . \u201c Some people thought it was a referendum on Trump , but instead it was a comparison of the candidates \u2019 experience . \u201d\nUpdated at 10:00 p.m. -- Other outlets declare Handel the winner\nCNN has also called the race for Republican Karen Handel .\nUpdated at 9:58 p.m. -- First outlet calls race for Handel\nA first outlet , Decision Desk HQ , has declared Republican Karen Handel the winner . The AP and other news outlets have yet to declare .\nWell , this is a headline we certainly did n't expect to see today from our colleague Mitchell Northam : `` Fulton \u2018 quiet and somewhat boring \u2019 on Ga. 6th District Election Day . ''\nFulton is notorious in these parts for election day mishaps . Back in April , its 6th District vote totals were n't reported until after 2 a.m. due to a memory card error .\nBut no major gaffs , problems or mistakes have been reported tonight in Fulton . In fact , Richard Barron , the county \u2019 s director of elections and registrations , told Northam that the most common complaint that Fulton heard Tuesday was from people who wanted to vote , but didn \u2019 t live in the 6th District .\n\u201c It seems like an ordinary Election Day , \u201d Barron said . \u201c It was quiet and somewhat boring , which is good . \u201d\nUpdated at 9:40 p.m. -- Ossoff 's future hinges on mail-in ballots\nThe window is beginning to close for Democrat Jon Ossoff . Republican Karen Handel is racking up a notable lead in the election returns as early and today 's in-person votes have been tallied .\nDemocratic strategists we 're talking to say there 's still a path for Ossoff , albeit a narrowing one . Their hopes hinge on mail-in ballots . Those have yet to be tallied but tend to favor Democrats . Ossoff will likely need to win an overwhelming margin to stay alive . That 's a high bar but not unfathomable , we 're told .\nDeKalb 's mail-in ballots are expected to be tallied shortly . That should be a big pickup opportunity for Ossoff , although he 's been underperforming there re : in-person votes tonight .\nWe mentioned earlier today how Cobb would be an important bellwether in this race . The county is deeply Republican , yes , but just how well Democrat Jon Ossoff does there will be critical in determining his performance overall .\nA number-crunching friend of ours predicted that Ossoff needed to secure more than 45 percent of the vote there to win the contest . So the Democrat 's campaign is likely not happy at all with the current numbers , which have him trailing Handel there by nearly 20 percentage points and notching only about 40 percent of the vote .\nAs we mentioned earlier , Ossoff is also underperforming in DeKalb , the most Democratic part of the district . He needs to rack up the score there to stay competitive .\nMeanwhile , Republicans strategists , and even some Democrats , began to question whether Ossoff still had a path to victory as precincts continued to trickle in .\nJohn Ossoff \u2019 s supporters got a pep talk from Rep. John Lewis , the civil rights icon who helped launch the candidate \u2019 s political career .\nLewis , who hired Ossoff as an intern , told the crowd that they \u2019 ve \u201c made a major down payment in changing our nation . \u201d\n\u201c When we send Jon Ossoff to Washington , we are all going with him , \u201d he said . \u201c This district , the state of Georgia , will never ever be the same if Jon Ossoff is elected . \u201d\nHe said Ossoff \u2019 s campaign has already inspired other Democratic candidates to step forward and run for office .\n\u201c So I say to you , more than ever before , we need a leader . We need someone like Jon Ossoff . We need his kindness . We need his leadership . For these are the times that try a man \u2019 s soul . \u201d\nUpdated at 8:50 p.m. \u2013 Cautious optimism at Ossoff party\nMore than 500 people crammed into a Dunwoody hotel ballroom to cheer on Jon Ossoff , erupting into cheers each time CNN aired updates on the race -- and a deafening chorus of boos when President Donald Trump flashed on the screen .\nThe mood was cautiously optimistic , as early vote totals showed a tight race .\nMelanie Childers , a structural designer , said she was feeling \u201c nervous but good \u201d about the race .\n\u201c I was out there today talking to folks , and I saw a lot of thumbs up , a lot of waves and happiness . I think we can pull this off , \u201d she said .\nUpdated at 8:30 p.m. -- Early returns looking positive for Handel\nEarly election night returns in Georgia 's 6th District are sending positive signals about Republican Karen Handel 's chances of capturing Price 's old seat .\nRoughly 90 minutes after the polls closed , Democrat Jon Ossoff was leading Handel only narrowly . Ossoff 's campaign was counting on strong support from early in-person voters , and Handel 's campaign is doing much better than expected in that category .\nEarly numbers from DeKalb County also are n't where Democrats would like them to be :\nOssoff is expected to get a boost from mail-in ballots , which are typically not counted until later and tend to favor Democrats . What 's unclear at the moment is how much the strong early turnout will cannibalize the in-person votes that both campaigns were hoping to run up the score with today .\nAt Handel 's watch party , dozens of supporters cheered and crowded around TV screens when Fox News showed early results with about a 2 percentage point lead for Handel .\nMatthew Hardwick , wearing a \u201c Make America Great Again \u201d hat , said he \u2019 s confident Handel would triumph .\n\u201c We need to maintain the Republican seat , and she has a lot of experience , \u201d said Hardwick , who lives in Smyrna in Cobb County . \u201c So far , so good . \u201d\nOur colleagues at Karen Handel 's watch party in Dunwoody , Mark Niesse and Jim Galloway , sent this dispatch after the Republican made a surprise early speech to supporters :\nThe Republican arrived to loud cheers at her campaign event just before 8 p.m. Tuesday night as supporters showed enthusiasm for their candidate \u2019 s lead in early in-person voting tallies . Handel said the early results were \u201c very encouraging . \u201d\n`` It 's still very very early , '' she told the crowd . `` To win in-person early voting is big . ''\nHandel told her supporters to wait for more returns to come in and hope the trend continues .\n`` Whatever happens tonight , this is the most incredible group I 've ever had the privilege of working with , \u201d she said .\nAt least one couple wearing Bikers for Trump garb is here .\nState Sen. Kay Kirkpatrick , who won Judson Hill \u2019 s District 32 Senate seat is here . AG Chris Carr is here as well \u2013 but otherwise a notable lack of statewide Republicans .\nUpdated at 7:20 p.m. -- Uncle Sam awaits Karen Handel\nHere 's the first dispatch from our colleague Mark Niesse at Republican Karen Handel 's Dunwoody watch party :\nUncle Sam \u2013 or at least a man dressed like him \u2013 greeted supporters of Republican Karen Handel as they began to arrive at her election night watch party . The dressed-up man , Peter Ludwinski , said the choice was clear between Handel and Democrat Jon Ossoff . \u201c People support him are misled and walking dead , \u201d Ludwinski said . \u201c On the issues \u2013 it \u2019 s like they \u2019 ve lost their minds . He \u2019 s against common sense and against the nation. \u201d Handel \u2019 s backers surrounded a podium tuned to Fox News while upbeat songs played , including and \u201c Don \u2019 t Worry About a Thing \u201d by Bob Marley and \u201c Spirit in the Sky \u201d by Norman Greenbaum . Like Ossoff \u2019 s campaign event , Handel \u2019 s party also offers a cash bar for donors to contribute a bit more to the most expensive congressional race in history , costing more than $ 50 million .\nPolls have closed everywhere outside of two precincts in DeKalb County .\nPer our colleague Kristina Torres , those two precincts had received permission from a judge to extend voting by 30 minutes after they experienced problems checking voters in this morning .\nRead more here about how the votes are tallied , and follow along with the election results as they come in live here .\nAs far as congressional districts go , the 6th is compact . It encompasses portions of just three counties : north Fulton , east Cobb and north DeKalb . Here are a few things to keep an eye on as vote tallies begin to trickle in from this suburban stretch of north Atlanta :\nNorth Fulton is home to some of the most conservative turf in the district . Republican Karen Handel hails from there , and it encompasses the highest share of early votes . The county has a reputation for being slow to tally its votes ( it took Fulton until after 2 a.m. to fully report during the first round of votes in April ) , but Fulton \u2019 s top elections official said he expects things to move smoothly today since there \u2019 s only one race on the ballot .\nis home to some of the most conservative turf in the district .

North DeKalb accounts for the most Democratic-leaning part of the district . It \u2019 s where Democrat Jon Ossoff grew up , and it \u2019 s also where he \u2019 ll be looking to rack up votes . Voting at two precincts there has been extended by 30 minutes after officials reported slow check-ins this morning .\naccounts for the most Democratic-leaning part of the district .

Voting at two precincts there has been extended by 30 minutes after officials reported slow check-ins this morning . As we mentioned below , it \u2019 s particularly crucial to look at Cobb County , which is a traditional Republican stronghold . If Ossoff does well there it \u2019 ll be a good sign for his odds to win the congressional seat .\nIt \u2019 s worth checking out our breakdown of how the three counties voted by party and neighborhood during the contest \u2019 s first round on April 18 . Back then , the 11 Republicans on the ballot collectively won 51 percent of the vote , with Democrats picking up the remaining 49 percent . If Handel is able to hold onto the precincts her party won two months ago and prevent Ossoff from winning any additional ones she \u2019 ll be in good shape .\nUpdated at 6:20 p.m. -- Who will be hurt by the rain ?\nAt least one local GOP strategist thinks that Karen Handel will be aided by today 's rain , according to the AJC 's Torres .\nElections officials are continuing to report a slow but steady turnout . That 's good news for Handel , according to GOP strategist Chip Lake said .\n\u201c If you \u2019 re Karen Handel , you want as many people voting on Election Day , \u201d said Lake , adding that Handel \u2019 s margin over Ossoff among people voting today could be as high as 20 points -- assuming they come out to cast a ballot .\nUpdated at 6:10 p.m. \u2013 The superPAC offering free rides to the polls\nEven before today \u2019 s rain came into the forecast , a super PAC had raised more than $ 60,000 to offer free rides to the polls for 6th District voters .\nMy Ride to Vote has been offering voters of all political stripes a ride to precincts , much as they did during last year \u2019 s presidential race in Pennsylvania , Florida and North Carolina .\nVoters were able to use the service by calling or texting a hotline that sent them a promo code that worked on the Uber app .\nUpdated at 6 p.m. -- Our latest analysis of the race\nWe 're getting close to go-time . Check out our preview of the race on Facebook Live :\nUpdated at 5:50 p.m. -- Of victory parties and cash bars\nAn hour before the polls closed , more than 50 reporters already packed Jon Ossoff 's victory party at the Westin in Sandy Springs .\nSupporters were expected to show up in force by 8 p.m . They better bring their wallets .\nUpdated at 5:40 p.m. \u2013 Online betting market predicts Handel win\nTake this with as many grains of salt as you 'd like , but the online election prediction market PredictIt is projecting that Karen Handel will win tonight :\n\u201c Until recently , PredictIt traders had shown confidence in an Ossoff victory . Shares on the likelihood of Ossoff winning closed above shares on Handel winning continuously since May 16 and saw spreads reaching as high as 36 cents on June 11 . That trend ended yesterday , June 19 , after almost 50,000 shares traded hands . After opening at 44 cents , Handel share prices closed at 52 cents . Meanwhile , Ossoff opened at 60 cents and has trended down ever since , dropping to a current price of 46 cents . \u201d\nRecent polling in this race shows Handel and Democrat Jon Ossoff neck-and-neck , with only one-tenth of a percentage point between them .\nA federal judge in early May extended voter registration in the district by two months , part of an ongoing lawsuit over how Georgia handles voter registration ahead of federal runoff elections . Voters had until May 21st to register , an extension that led to an extra 8,000 voters being added to the rolls .\nMost of those newbies did not vote early , according to a recent AJC analysis . Only one in five of them voted early , comprising about 1.2 percent of the race \u2019 s total early vote .\nMark Rountree , a local pollster from the Republican-leaning firm Landmark Communications , recently posted this analysis to Facebook yesterday :\nThat is a pretty low impact , actually , considering what was at stake for all candidates . When 7PM strikes on Election night , we estimate that maybe 2,750 or so of these voters will have voted . Probably split 3-1 for Ossoff , so maybe 700 of these votes will be for Handel vs perhaps 2,100 for Ossoff : a 1,400 vote differential . Extra clarification ( a few people asked ) : More than 10,000 new voters were registered during those 60 days in question and then processed ( I don \u2019 t remember the number at the moment ) . However just 1600 have actually voted in early voting so far , and perhaps around a total of 2750 will have voted once Election Day voting has closed .\nUpdated at 4:55 p.m. \u2013 Prominent Democrats weigh in on race\nAfter entering the 6th District race on a pledge to \u201c make Trump furious , \u201d Democrat Jon Ossoff has tacked hard to the center , advocating for bolstering tech jobs and cutting government waste as a way to win over independents and unhappy Republicans .\nDemocrats have tried to walk a similar line before in Georgia , vouching for moderate-sounding proposals while trying to keep a base of left-leaning supporters energized . It hasn \u2019 t worked ( see Jason Carter , the party \u2019 s unsuccessful candidate for governor in 2014 ) .\nOur colleague Jill Vejnoska caught up with Carter , the grandson of former President Jimmy Carter , during an event today on the roof ( yes , roof ) of his grandfather \u2019 s presidential library .\nHe said he \u2019 s optimistic about Ossoff pulling out a win . But Carter cautioned that political types shouldn \u2019 t draw too many broader conclusions from tonight \u2019 s race given all the outside money that \u2019 s streamed into the district .\n\u201c It 's clear , though , that his demeanor , his message of bringing people together , of bringing some civility back into politics has resonated in that district , \u201d Carter said of Ossoff . \u201c And that to me is a great lesson . \u201d\nState Rep. Scott Holcomb , an Atlanta Democrat whose power center lies in DeKalb , said he also thinks Ossoff will be victorious .\n`` I only came to that conclusion in the last few days because this is not a district that a Democrat should win based on the partisan breakdown of voters , \u201d he said . \u201c But I \u2019 ve watched the race closely . Ossoff ran a better campaign and his supporters are far more enthusiastic . \u201d\nUpdated at 4:10 p.m. \u2013 Poring over the early vote\nAs we wait for the polls to close , let 's take a look at the votes that rolled in well before today .\nEarly turnout in this race has been historic , our colleagues Torres and Jennifer Peebles report , with more than 140,000 people casting their ballots early in person or by absentee-by-mail ballots . That \u2019 s a 150 percent increase over the number of people who voted early ahead of the race \u2019 s original April 18 special election .\nIn DeKalb County , about 25 percent of eligible voters turned out early . More than one-in-three registered people voted early in Fulton County \u2019 s portion of the 6th District , while more than 23 percent came out early in Cobb .\nThe turnout ahead of the nationally watched race has surprised everyone . While typical turnout during off-year special elections is notoriously low , Georgia \u2019 s 6th District special election on April 18 ( which decided who was in this month \u2019 s runoff ) topped 37 percent \u2014 nearly 194,000 people voted . That \u2019 s a turnout more common for a midterm contest than a special election . This time , in Round 2 , many are expecting easily more than 200,000 voters \u2014 with some saying it will go even higher in a district that has about 530,000 registered voters in all .\nWe also know that 37 percent of the people who voted in the runoff also cast ballots in the 2016 Republican presidential primary , versus 22 percent for the Democratic presidential primary .\nRead Torres and Peebles ' analysis of the early vote and what it could mean here .\nAs we mentioned above , this 6th District contest has become the most expensive in the history of the U.S. House , prompting more than $ 50 million in spending . It 's nearing the records hit by the most expensive Senate contests of all time -- pretty impressive considering that we 're talking about a three-county district and not an entire state .\nHere are some key figures from the totals we reported yesterday :\n$ 42 million -- that 's how much has been spent or reserved for TV and radio ads ( about two-thirds of that came in the runoff ) .\n$ 14.2 million -- how much of the above total was spent by Ossoff 's campaign .\n$ 2.5 million -- how much Handel 's campaign spent on ads .\nMuch of the rest came from outside groups and the two political parties .\nThe nonpartisan advocacy organization Issue One has a higher tally of money spent on this race : $ 59.6 million .\nIf you want more detail on how the campaigns spent the rest of their money , click here .\nUpdated at 3:20 p.m. -- A little more about the candidates\nAn inexperienced shill for Nancy Pelosi . A career politician who would harm women 's health . Jon Ossoff , Karen Handel , the two parties and a handful of outside groups have spent millions trying to shape public perception of their opponents .\nBut in the hours before the polls close in the 6th District , it 's worth taking a step back . Check out our in-depth profiles of Handel and Ossoff .\nWe included this item in our morning newsletter today , but we think it bears reposting here :\nIf you \u2019 re looking for a bellwether tonight , keep your eye on Cobb County , the most Republican portion of the Sixth District . One of our number-crunching friends tells that these returns are the ones to watch . One month ago , the runoff was held for state Senate District 32 . Most of that state legislative district and the Cobb County portion of the Sixth overlap . Republican Kay Kirkpatrick , a physician with strong ties to former congressman Tom Price , beat Democrat Christine Triebsch , a Marietta lawyer . ( The seat had formerly been held by Republican Judson Hill . ) In that runoff , Kirkpatrick pulled 58 percent of the vote to Triebsch \u2019 s 42 percent . The latter was woefully underfunded . Our number-crunching friend tells us that Ossoff doesn \u2019 t have to win Cobb to pull out a victory tonight . But he does have to do better than Triebsch . By his calculation , if you see Ossoff pulling 45 percent or better in Cobb \u2013 he \u2019 ll win . If he \u2019 s pulling only 43 percent \u2013 Ossoff could still win , but it \u2019 ll be much closer . If Handel keeps Ossoff under 43 percent in Cobb , then the night is probably hers , and Republicans retain a congressional seat they \u2019 ve held since Newt Gingrich was a young man .\nOur AJC photographers have been on the ground today snapping pictures of voters and the two campaigns . Check out a photo gallery of their work here .\nUpdated at 2:25 p.m. \u2013 Voters weigh in on being in the spotlight\nThe voters of the 6th District have been clobbered with non-stop attack ads on television , radio and in the mail for months now . Many have been on the receiving end of campaign canvassers at their front door several times over .\nIt 's hard to overstate how many of the locals we talked to who are anxious for things to get back to normal .\nTake Keiko Coghlin of Sandy Springs . She told our intern Martha Michael that she voted for Karen Handel because Jon Ossoff \u2019 s campaign \u201c just drove me crazy . \u201d\n\u201c They called our house , stuffed up our mailbox , they even rang our doorbell . We were really turned off by that , \u201d Coghlin said . \u201c For anyone that was on the fence in this election , this kind of stuff really pushed you towards Handel . \u201d\nSome of Jon Ossoff \u2019 s supporters said they see the national attention as energizing .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve lived in Cobb County since 1998 . I \u2019 ve taught here . And I know how deep the conservative roots run here . But I \u2019 ve been so encouraged by the way people have come out and come together , \u201d said Karen Thorpe , a former teacher who came out to wave signs for Ossoff in Roswell on Tuesday morning . \u201c This is democracy at its finest . \u201d\n6th District voters who haven \u2019 t already dashed to the polls should plan on getting very wet when they do cast their ballots , our colleague Ben Brasch reports . And it \u2019 s only supposed to get worse as the day goes on .\nThe National Weather Service has issued weather advisories and flash flood warnings for the region , the latter of which is expected to last until after polls close .\nWe don \u2019 t have a great sense yet re : how that will impact turnout yet . In general , though , rain tends to dampen turnout which has historically hurt Democrats . Ossoff \u2019 s campaign said it \u2019 s confident it has the edge in terms of voter enthusiasm , which can help make up for any voters staying home due to the weather .\nMeanwhile , Georgia GOP Chairman John Watson tweeted this about the fain :\nAnd just like that , DeKalb County officials have received permission to extend voting hours at two precincts for 30 more minutes tonight . Torres has more .\nUpdated at 1:15 p.m. \u2013 Fairly smooth at the polls so far\nIt \u2019 s been relatively smooth sailing so far at 6th District polling places , Torres reports .\nVoters at two polling locations in DeKalb County reported slow check-ins earlier this morning , which could cause local officials to seek an extension of voting hours .\nOtherwise , it \u2019 s been pretty calm here , outside of the very ominous storm clouds that have hovered over the region this afternoon .\nFulton County \u2019 s top elections official vowed that voting would go smoothly today , the AJC \u2019 s Arielle Kass reports . During the first round of 6th District voting on April 18 , it took Fulton County until after 2 a.m. to count the votes as the county juggled a number of separate database and an issue popped up with a memory card in Roswell .\nIt was nothing if not a circus at an orthodox church in Roswell as Republican Karen Handel cast her vote .\nDozens of reporters and camera crews scrambled for a view of the candidate as she quickly filled out her ballot . After the deed was done , Handel repeatedly mentioned how her opponent could n't do the same .\n`` I 've lived here for nearly 25 years , and I think that 's going to make a big difference to the voters in this district , '' she said .\nOssoff lives next door in the 5th District . The Democrat said it 's so his fianc\u00e9 can walk to work at Emory University hospital . Congressional candidates do n't have to live in the districts they represent , but Ossoff said he plans to move to the 6th if he wins .\nShe was nearly drowned out by roughly 50 Ossoff supporters as they chanted `` flip the 6th ! flip the 6th ! '' at the entrance of the polling place .\nDemocrat Jon Ossoff held a host of rah-rah rallies across the district Tuesday , including an event in Sandy Springs with about two dozen supporters \u2013 and just as many reporters .\n\u201c This is about this community at an extraordinary moment of time , a coalition that we have built that \u2019 s founded on the core values that bring people together in this community , \u201d he said , giving his volunteers a closing nudge .\n\u201c It \u2019 s close . And those of us in the room right now \u2013 and I know you \u2019 ve been working hard for hours , days , months \u2013 this is the final push . Let \u2019 s give it everything we \u2019 ve got . \u201d\nU.S. Rep. Steve Scalise , R-La. , tweeted his endorsement of Karen Handel in today \u2019 s contest , writing that she is a \u201c great candidate . \u201d\nThe 6th District race took a tenser turn after Scalise and other Republican legislators , including Georgia Rep. Barry Loudermilk , were ambushed at a baseball field in suburban Washington last week . Scalise , the House 's No . 3 Republican , was shot in the hip , suffering severe damage in his internal organs , and is in critical condition at a local D.C. hospital .\nHandel and several neighbors soon thereafter received a threatening letter with a white powder later deemed to be non-hazardous by the FBI . Jon Ossoff hired a security detail amid a spate of unspecified threats targeting him . Both condemned an attack ad by a fringe GOP super PAC that sought to politicize the shooting .\nIt \u2019 s uncertain whether the shooting will help shore up votes for either candidate , but a WSB poll released Monday showed a majority of voters who had yet to cast their ballots said they had no effect on their decision .\nAbout one-third of election-day voters said the attack would make them \u201c more likely \u201d to cast their ballots , and most of those were Republican .\nWelcome to The \u2588\u2588\u2588 's live blog . We 'll be tracking all things 6th District special election throughout this rainy day ( and night ) in this closely-watched nail-biter of a contest between Republican Karen Handel and Democrat Jon Ossoff .\nThe two candidates are duking it out for Tom Price 's former U.S. House seat , which has been vacant since the six-term lawmaker was sworn in as Health and Human Services secretary on Feb. 12 . The race has attracted a deluge of outside money and attention in the intervening four months . By our tally , more than $ 50 million has been spent so far , making it by far the most expensive contest in the history of the U.S. House .\nFueling the intense outside interest is the idea that the special election will tell the country something about support for President Donald Trump ( the commander-in-chief tweeted about the race several times on Monday and Tuesday ) , Democrats ' nascent resistance movement and the House GOP 's health care overhaul heading into next year 's high-stakes midterm election . Both candidates insist their focus is on DeKalb , Fulton and Cobb counties , the affluent and well-educated suburbs that will decide their fate Tuesday .\nCheck back here throughout the day for the latest updates on the candidates , the turnout , the results and the reaction .

    "content_original": "Georgia is sending its first Republican woman to Congress.\n\nNews outlets began declaring Karen Handel the winner of Georgia's 6th District U.S. House seat at roughly 10 p.m. Tuesday evening, three hours after most polls closed here in the north Atlanta suburbs. She will become the first woman to represent the Peach State in Congress since Democrat Cynthia McKinney lost her reelection bid 11 years ago.\n\nHandel's hard-fought victory over Democrat Jon Ossoff came amid a deluge of outside money and attention. The race was being viewed nationally as a key test of President Donald Trump's popularity among GOP voters, the Republican health care overhaul and the left's nascent resistance movement. And the vote, as of 11:15 p.m. Tuesday night, was not as close as some had anticipated.\n\nRead our condensed takeout of the race here. For full coverage, check out our live blog below and redesigned myAJC politics page.\n\nUpdated at 12:05 a.m. -- Trump calls to congratulate Handel\n\nKaren Handel was on the phone with our colleague Kyle Wingfield tonight when she had to quickly answer a call on the other line. Turned out it was President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cHe wished me well, said it was a great campaign, that he was very proud of me,\" she later told Wingfield. \"He said he knew I was going to win. I\u2019m glad I did.\u201d\n\nWhen Trump visited the 6th District and campaigned for Handel back in April, he famously told her she'd \"better win.\" Recounting that comment on Tuesday, Handel chuckled and jokingly added, \u201cI\u2019m not sure what the consequences would be if you did not meet the president\u2019s expectations.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 11:05 p.m. -- A final thought on today's turnout\n\nKristina Torres, the AJC's point person on Georgia's voting trends, sent along this take putting tonight's final vote tally in perspective:\n\nSixth District voters turned out in unprecedented numbers Tuesday for their runoff, but it takes a step back to appreciate by just how much. We already knew that while typical turnout during off-year special elections is notoriously low, Georgia\u2019s 6th District special election on April 18 (which decided who was in Tuesday\u2019s runoff) topped 37 percent \u2014 nearly 194,000 people voted. But Tuesday\u2019s unofficial ballot count topped 241,500. That\u2019s more than the 210,000 votes cast in the district in 2014 \u2013 putting the contest squarely in common with midterm contests, not special elections. Many had predicted a 210,000-plus turnout, although few were sure how high it would go. One of those who got it right was Mark Rountree, the president of Landmark Communications, who predicted an overall turnout of 235,000 to 240,000 voters \u2014 with a majority having voted early (and that\u2019s what happened). The 6th District itself has long been considered highly motivated. In that sense, turnout percentage-wise didn\u2019t disappoint. In a district with about 526,000 registered voters in all, nearly half of them came out: Unofficial turnout stood at about 46 percent in the race.\n\nUpdated at 10:55 p.m. -- Handel thanks boisterous crowd\n\nOur colleague Mark Niesse, who's been posted up at Handel's watch party tonight, sent along this report describing the jubilant scene at the Hyatt Regency in Dunwoody:\n\nRepublican Karen Handel celebrated her win over Democrat Jon Ossoff on Tuesday to a crowd chanting \u201cKaren, Karen, Karen\u201d as she heads to Congress to represent Atlanta\u2019s northern suburbs. \u201cThis was going to be a very, very tight race, it was going to be contentious, and it was going to require all hands on deck, and that\u2019s exactly what we had,\u201d Handel said. Handel thanked President Donald Trump and other prominent Republicans who supported her in the nationally-watched runoff, leading to cheers of \u201cTrump, Trump, Trump\u201d from the crowd. ...She said Ossoff was gracious when he called her to concede. \u201cWe may have some different beliefs, but we are part of one community, the community of the 6th District,\" she said. \u201cMy pledge is to be part of the solution to focus on governing, to put my experience to work to help solve the very serious issues we\u2019re facing in this country.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 10:50 p.m. -- Trump tweets congratulations\n\nThe president had been silent for most of the day Tuesday while 6th District residents hit the polls, but Donald Trump was quick to congratulate Republican Karen Handel on Twitter after she defeated Democrat Jon Ossoff.\n\nThe president also thanked Fox News for saying that Handel's victory represented a \"huge win\" for Trump and the GOP.\n\nUpdated at 10:40 p.m. -- The 'fight goes on'\n\nDemocrat Jon Ossoff conceded to Republican Karen Handel in the hard-fought race to represent Georgia\u2019s 6th District, ending a defiant address to hundreds of disappointed supporters with a pledge that the \u201cfight goes on.\u201d\n\nOssoff, a 30-year-old former congressional aide, shattered fundraising records and became a national Democratic rising star with his bid to flip the suburban Atlanta district. But Handel staved off his fierce challenge by consolidating GOP support across the district.\n\nThe Democrat said little about his political future \u2013 namely whether he would seek to challenge Handel next year \u2013 in a brief address to supporters. He has said repeatedly he would have to talk with his fianc\u00e9e before deciding about another political run.\n\nBut his speech suggested he would not stray far from the political spotlight. He thanks his supporters for providing a \u201cbeacon of hope for people in Georgia.\u201d And he said his campaign \u201cshowed the world that in places where no one thought it was even possible to fight, we could fight.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not the outcome any of us would hope for,\u201d said Ossoff. \u201cBut this is the beginning of something much bigger than us. So thank you \u2013 thank you for the most extraordinary experience that I\u2019ve ever had the honor of being a part of.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 10:25 p.m. -- Ossoff concedes\n\nDemocrat Jon Ossoff called Republican Karen Handel around 10:15 p.m. on Tuesday night to concede the race, his campaign said. He is expected to speak to his crowd of supporters shortly, bringing the race to an earlier than expected end.\n\nUpdated at 10:20 p.m. -- An outpouring from Republicans\n\nRepublicans from D.C. to Marietta cheered Karen Handel after she was declared the victor in Tuesday's 6th District special election.\n\n\"Things are looking great for Karen H!\" President Donald Trump tweeted roughly 20 minutes after the race was called:\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan congratulated Handel for a \"hard-earned and well-deserved victory.\"\n\n\u201cDemocrats from coast to coast threw everything they had at this race, and Karen would not be defeated,\" the Wisconsin Republican said in a statement.\n\nRepublican Gov. Nathan Deal, who campaigned for Handel on Monday, also tweeted his congratulations:\n\nU.S. Rep. Doug Collins, R-Gainesville, said Tuesday's results say \"exactly what we knew about this district.\"\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a conservative district. And if you\u2019re a Democrat who spent as much money as they did, and barely got what Hillary Clinton got, it says the district was not for sale,\u201d Collins said. \u201cAnd after a $30 million onslaught, the district saw through it.\u201d\n\nCollins said expects Handel to face a stiff challenge in 2018, whether from Ossoff or another contender.\n\n\u201cBut Karen Handel, as an incumbent with a record of support, will win again,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the last three months, we\u2019ve had three moral victories from Democrats \u2013 and no wins.\u201d\n\nState Rep. Betty Price said she\u2019s excited that Handel will succeed the congressional seat that was previously held by her husband, Tom Price, who is now President Donald Trump\u2019s health secretary.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably not unexpected,\u201d Price said of the result. \u201cSome people thought it was a referendum on Trump, but instead it was a comparison of the candidates\u2019 experience.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 10:00 p.m. -- Other outlets declare Handel the winner\n\nCNN has also called the race for Republican Karen Handel.\n\nUpdated at 9:58 p.m. -- First outlet calls race for Handel\n\nA first outlet, Decision Desk HQ, has declared Republican Karen Handel the winner. The AP and other news outlets have yet to declare.\n\nUpdated at 9:50 p.m. -- Fulton County surprisingly quiet\n\nWell, this is a headline we certainly didn't expect to see today from our colleague Mitchell Northam: \"Fulton \u2018quiet and somewhat boring\u2019 on Ga. 6th District Election Day.\"\n\nFulton is notorious in these parts for election day mishaps. Back in April, its 6th District vote totals weren't reported until after 2 a.m. due to a memory card error.\n\nBut no major gaffs, problems or mistakes have been reported tonight in Fulton. In fact, Richard Barron, the county\u2019s director of elections and registrations, told Northam that the most common complaint that Fulton heard Tuesday was from people who wanted to vote, but didn\u2019t live in the 6th District.\n\n\u201cIt seems like an ordinary Election Day,\u201d Barron said. \u201cIt was quiet and somewhat boring, which is good.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 9:40 p.m. -- Ossoff's future hinges on mail-in ballots\n\nThe window is beginning to close for Democrat Jon Ossoff. Republican Karen Handel is racking up a notable lead in the election returns as early and today's in-person votes have been tallied.\n\nDemocratic strategists we're talking to say there's still a path for Ossoff, albeit a narrowing one. Their hopes hinge on mail-in ballots. Those have yet to be tallied but tend to favor Democrats. Ossoff will likely need to win an overwhelming margin to stay alive. That's a high bar but not unfathomable, we're told.\n\nDeKalb's mail-in ballots are expected to be tallied shortly. That should be a big pickup opportunity for Ossoff, although he's been underperforming there re: in-person votes tonight.\n\nUpdated at 9:25 p.m. -- Ossoff slipping in Cobb\n\nWe mentioned earlier today how Cobb would be an important bellwether in this race. The county is deeply Republican, yes, but just how well Democrat Jon Ossoff does there will be critical in determining his performance overall.\n\nA number-crunching friend of ours predicted that Ossoff needed to secure more than 45 percent of the vote there to win the contest. So the Democrat's campaign is likely not happy at all with the current numbers, which have him trailing Handel there by nearly 20 percentage points and notching only about 40 percent of the vote.\n\nAs we mentioned earlier, Ossoff is also underperforming in DeKalb, the most Democratic part of the district. He needs to rack up the score there to stay competitive.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans strategists, and even some Democrats, began to question whether Ossoff still had a path to victory as precincts continued to trickle in.\n\nUpdated at 9:05 p.m. -- 'Major down payment'\n\nJohn Ossoff\u2019s supporters got a pep talk from Rep. John Lewis, the civil rights icon who helped launch the candidate\u2019s political career.\n\nLewis, who hired Ossoff as an intern, told the crowd that they\u2019ve \u201cmade a major down payment in changing our nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we send Jon Ossoff to Washington, we are all going with him,\u201d he said. \u201cThis district, the state of Georgia, will never ever be the same if Jon Ossoff is elected.\u201d\n\nHe said Ossoff\u2019s campaign has already inspired other Democratic candidates to step forward and run for office.\n\n\u201cSo I say to you, more than ever before, we need a leader. We need someone like Jon Ossoff. We need his kindness. We need his leadership. For these are the times that try a man\u2019s soul.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 8:50 p.m. \u2013 Cautious optimism at Ossoff party\n\nMore than 500 people crammed into a Dunwoody hotel ballroom to cheer on Jon Ossoff, erupting into cheers each time CNN aired updates on the race -- and a deafening chorus of boos when President Donald Trump flashed on the screen.\n\nThe mood was cautiously optimistic, as early vote totals showed a tight race.\n\nMelanie Childers, a structural designer, said she was feeling \u201cnervous but good\u201d about the race.\n\n\u201cI was out there today talking to folks, and I saw a lot of thumbs up, a lot of waves and happiness. I think we can pull this off,\u201d she said.\n\nUpdated at 8:30 p.m. -- Early returns looking positive for Handel\n\nEarly election night returns in Georgia's 6th District are sending positive signals about Republican Karen Handel's chances of capturing Price's old seat.\n\nRoughly 90 minutes after the polls closed, Democrat Jon Ossoff was leading Handel only narrowly. Ossoff's campaign was counting on strong support from early in-person voters, and Handel's campaign is doing much better than expected in that category.\n\nEarly numbers from DeKalb County also aren't where Democrats would like them to be:\n\nOssoff is expected to get a boost from mail-in ballots, which are typically not counted until later and tend to favor Democrats. What's unclear at the moment is how much the strong early turnout will cannibalize the in-person votes that both campaigns were hoping to run up the score with today.\n\nAt Handel's watch party, dozens of supporters cheered and crowded around TV screens when Fox News showed early results with about a 2 percentage point lead for Handel.\n\nMatthew Hardwick, wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat, said he\u2019s confident Handel would triumph.\n\n\u201cWe need to maintain the Republican seat, and she has a lot of experience,\u201d said Hardwick, who lives in Smyrna in Cobb County. \u201cSo far, so good.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 8:00 p.m. -- Handel makes first appearance\n\nOur colleagues at Karen Handel's watch party in Dunwoody, Mark Niesse and Jim Galloway, sent this dispatch after the Republican made a surprise early speech to supporters:\n\nThe Republican arrived to loud cheers at her campaign event just before 8 p.m. Tuesday night as supporters showed enthusiasm for their candidate\u2019s lead in early in-person voting tallies. Handel said the early results were \u201cvery encouraging.\u201d\n\n\"It's still very very early,\" she told the crowd. \"To win in-person early voting is big.\"\n\nHandel told her supporters to wait for more returns to come in and hope the trend continues.\n\n\"Whatever happens tonight, this is the most incredible group I've ever had the privilege of working with,\u201d she said.\n\nAt least one couple wearing Bikers for Trump garb is here.\n\nState Sen. Kay Kirkpatrick, who won Judson Hill\u2019s District 32 Senate seat is here. AG Chris Carr is here as well \u2013 but otherwise a notable lack of statewide Republicans.\n\nUpdated at 7:20 p.m. -- Uncle Sam awaits Karen Handel\n\nHere's the first dispatch from our colleague Mark Niesse at Republican Karen Handel's Dunwoody watch party:\n\nUncle Sam \u2013 or at least a man dressed like him \u2013 greeted supporters of Republican Karen Handel as they began to arrive at her election night watch party. The dressed-up man, Peter Ludwinski, said the choice was clear between Handel and Democrat Jon Ossoff. \u201cPeople support him are misled and walking dead,\u201d Ludwinski said. \u201cOn the issues \u2013 it\u2019s like they\u2019ve lost their minds. He\u2019s against common sense and against the nation.\u201d Handel\u2019s backers surrounded a podium tuned to Fox News while upbeat songs played, including and \u201cDon\u2019t Worry About a Thing\u201d by Bob Marley and \u201cSpirit in the Sky\u201d by Norman Greenbaum. Like Ossoff\u2019s campaign event, Handel\u2019s party also offers a cash bar for donors to contribute a bit more to the most expensive congressional race in history, costing more than $50 million.\n\nUpdated at 7:00 p.m. -- Most polls close\n\nPolls have closed everywhere outside of two precincts in DeKalb County.\n\nPer our colleague Kristina Torres, those two precincts had received permission from a judge to extend voting by 30 minutes after they experienced problems checking voters in this morning.\n\nRead more here about how the votes are tallied, and follow along with the election results as they come in live here.\n\nUpdated at 6:40 p.m. \u2013 6th District geography\n\nAs far as congressional districts go, the 6th is compact. It encompasses portions of just three counties: north Fulton, east Cobb and north DeKalb. Here are a few things to keep an eye on as vote tallies begin to trickle in from this suburban stretch of north Atlanta:\n\nNorth Fulton is home to some of the most conservative turf in the district. Republican Karen Handel hails from there, and it encompasses the highest share of early votes. The county has a reputation for being slow to tally its votes (it took Fulton until after 2 a.m. to fully report during the first round of votes in April), but Fulton\u2019s top elections official said he expects things to move smoothly today since there\u2019s only one race on the ballot.\n\nis home to some of the most conservative turf in the district.

North DeKalb accounts for the most Democratic-leaning part of the district. It\u2019s where Democrat Jon Ossoff grew up, and it\u2019s also where he\u2019ll be looking to rack up votes. Voting at two precincts there has been extended by 30 minutes after officials reported slow check-ins this morning.\n\naccounts for the most Democratic-leaning part of the district. It\u2019s where Democrat Jon Ossoff grew up, and it\u2019s also where he\u2019ll be looking to rack up votes. Voting at two precincts there has been extended by 30 minutes after officials reported slow check-ins this morning. As we mentioned below, it\u2019s particularly crucial to look at Cobb County, which is a traditional Republican stronghold. If Ossoff does well there it\u2019ll be a good sign for his odds to win the congressional seat.\n\nIt\u2019s worth checking out our breakdown of how the three counties voted by party and neighborhood during the contest\u2019s first round on April 18. Back then, the 11 Republicans on the ballot collectively won 51 percent of the vote, with Democrats picking up the remaining 49 percent. If Handel is able to hold onto the precincts her party won two months ago and prevent Ossoff from winning any additional ones she\u2019ll be in good shape.\n\nUpdated at 6:20 p.m. -- Who will be hurt by the rain?\n\nAt least one local GOP strategist thinks that Karen Handel will be aided by today's rain, according to the AJC's Torres.\n\nElections officials are continuing to report a slow but steady turnout. That's good news for Handel, according to GOP strategist Chip Lake said.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re Karen Handel, you want as many people voting on Election Day,\u201d said Lake, adding that Handel\u2019s margin over Ossoff among people voting today could be as high as 20 points -- assuming they come out to cast a ballot.\n\nUpdated at 6:10 p.m. \u2013 The superPAC offering free rides to the polls\n\nEven before today\u2019s rain came into the forecast, a super PAC had raised more than $60,000 to offer free rides to the polls for 6th District voters.\n\nMy Ride to Vote has been offering voters of all political stripes a ride to precincts, much as they did during last year\u2019s presidential race in Pennsylvania, Florida and North Carolina.\n\nVoters were able to use the service by calling or texting a hotline that sent them a promo code that worked on the Uber app.\n\nUpdated at 6 p.m. -- Our latest analysis of the race\n\nWe're getting close to go-time. Check out our preview of the race on Facebook Live:\n\nUpdated at 5:50 p.m. -- Of victory parties and cash bars\n\nAn hour before the polls closed, more than 50 reporters already packed Jon Ossoff's victory party at the Westin in Sandy Springs.\n\nSupporters were expected to show up in force by 8 p.m. They better bring their wallets.\n\nUpdated at 5:40 p.m. \u2013 Online betting market predicts Handel win\n\nTake this with as many grains of salt as you'd like, but the online election prediction market PredictIt is projecting that Karen Handel will win tonight:\n\n\u201cUntil recently, PredictIt traders had shown confidence in an Ossoff victory. Shares on the likelihood of Ossoff winning closed above shares on Handel winning continuously since May 16 and saw spreads reaching as high as 36 cents on June 11. That trend ended yesterday, June 19, after almost 50,000 shares traded hands. After opening at 44 cents, Handel share prices closed at 52 cents. Meanwhile, Ossoff opened at 60 cents and has trended down ever since, dropping to a current price of 46 cents.\u201d\n\nRecent polling in this race shows Handel and Democrat Jon Ossoff neck-and-neck, with only one-tenth of a percentage point between them.\n\nUpdated at 5:10 p.m.\u2013 Newly registered voters\n\nA federal judge in early May extended voter registration in the district by two months, part of an ongoing lawsuit over how Georgia handles voter registration ahead of federal runoff elections. Voters had until May 21st to register, an extension that led to an extra 8,000 voters being added to the rolls.\n\nMost of those newbies did not vote early, according to a recent AJC analysis. Only one in five of them voted early, comprising about 1.2 percent of the race\u2019s total early vote.\n\nMark Rountree, a local pollster from the Republican-leaning firm Landmark Communications, recently posted this analysis to Facebook yesterday:\n\nThat is a pretty low impact, actually, considering what was at stake for all candidates. When 7PM strikes on Election night, we estimate that maybe 2,750 or so of these voters will have voted. Probably split 3-1 for Ossoff, so maybe 700 of these votes will be for Handel vs perhaps 2,100 for Ossoff: a 1,400 vote differential. Extra clarification (a few people asked): More than 10,000 new voters were registered during those 60 days in question and then processed (I don\u2019t remember the number at the moment). However just 1600 have actually voted in early voting so far, and perhaps around a total of 2750 will have voted once Election Day voting has closed.\n\nUpdated at 4:55 p.m. \u2013 Prominent Democrats weigh in on race\n\nAfter entering the 6th District race on a pledge to \u201cmake Trump furious,\u201d Democrat Jon Ossoff has tacked hard to the center, advocating for bolstering tech jobs and cutting government waste as a way to win over independents and unhappy Republicans.\n\nDemocrats have tried to walk a similar line before in Georgia, vouching for moderate-sounding proposals while trying to keep a base of left-leaning supporters energized. It hasn\u2019t worked (see Jason Carter, the party\u2019s unsuccessful candidate for governor in 2014).\n\nOur colleague Jill Vejnoska caught up with Carter, the grandson of former President Jimmy Carter, during an event today on the roof (yes, roof) of his grandfather\u2019s presidential library.\n\nHe said he\u2019s optimistic about Ossoff pulling out a win. But Carter cautioned that political types shouldn\u2019t draw too many broader conclusions from tonight\u2019s race given all the outside money that\u2019s streamed into the district.\n\n\u201cIt's clear, though, that his demeanor, his message of bringing people together, of bringing some civility back into politics has resonated in that district,\u201d Carter said of Ossoff. \u201cAnd that to me is a great lesson.\u201d\n\nState Rep. Scott Holcomb, an Atlanta Democrat whose power center lies in DeKalb, said he also thinks Ossoff will be victorious.\n\n\"I only came to that conclusion in the last few days because this is not a district that a Democrat should win based on the partisan breakdown of voters,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve watched the race closely. Ossoff ran a better campaign and his supporters are far more enthusiastic.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 4:10 p.m. \u2013 Poring over the early vote\n\nAs we wait for the polls to close, let's take a look at the votes that rolled in well before today.\n\nEarly turnout in this race has been historic, our colleagues Torres and Jennifer Peebles report, with more than 140,000 people casting their ballots early in person or by absentee-by-mail ballots. That\u2019s a 150 percent increase over the number of people who voted early ahead of the race\u2019s original April 18 special election.\n\nIn DeKalb County, about 25 percent of eligible voters turned out early. More than one-in-three registered people voted early in Fulton County\u2019s portion of the 6th District, while more than 23 percent came out early in Cobb.\n\nSaid Torres over the weekend:\n\nThe turnout ahead of the nationally watched race has surprised everyone. While typical turnout during off-year special elections is notoriously low, Georgia\u2019s 6th District special election on April 18 (which decided who was in this month\u2019s runoff) topped 37 percent \u2014 nearly 194,000 people voted. That\u2019s a turnout more common for a midterm contest than a special election. This time, in Round 2, many are expecting easily more than 200,000 voters \u2014 with some saying it will go even higher in a district that has about 530,000 registered voters in all.\n\nWe also know that 37 percent of the people who voted in the runoff also cast ballots in the 2016 Republican presidential primary, versus 22 percent for the Democratic presidential primary.\n\nRead Torres and Peebles' analysis of the early vote and what it could mean here.\n\nUpdated at 3:50 p.m. -- Breaking down the money\n\nAs we mentioned above, this 6th District contest has become the most expensive in the history of the U.S. House, prompting more than $50 million in spending. It's nearing the records hit by the most expensive Senate contests of all time -- pretty impressive considering that we're talking about a three-county district and not an entire state.\n\nHere are some key figures from the totals we reported yesterday:\n\n$42 million -- that's how much has been spent or reserved for TV and radio ads (about two-thirds of that came in the runoff).\n\n$14.2 million -- how much of the above total was spent by Ossoff's campaign.\n\n$2.5 million -- how much Handel's campaign spent on ads.\n\nMuch of the rest came from outside groups and the two political parties.\n\nThe nonpartisan advocacy organization Issue One has a higher tally of money spent on this race: $59.6 million.\n\nIf you want more detail on how the campaigns spent the rest of their money, click here.\n\nUpdated at 3:20 p.m. -- A little more about the candidates\n\nAn inexperienced shill for Nancy Pelosi. A career politician who would harm women's health. Jon Ossoff, Karen Handel, the two parties and a handful of outside groups have spent millions trying to shape public perception of their opponents.\n\nBut in the hours before the polls close in the 6th District, it's worth taking a step back. Check out our in-depth profiles of Handel and Ossoff.\n\nUpdated at 2:45 p.m. -- Watch Cobb returns tonight\n\nWe included this item in our morning newsletter today, but we think it bears reposting here:\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a bellwether tonight, keep your eye on Cobb County, the most Republican portion of the Sixth District. One of our number-crunching friends tells that these returns are the ones to watch. One month ago, the runoff was held for state Senate District 32. Most of that state legislative district and the Cobb County portion of the Sixth overlap. Republican Kay Kirkpatrick, a physician with strong ties to former congressman Tom Price, beat Democrat Christine Triebsch, a Marietta lawyer. (The seat had formerly been held by Republican Judson Hill.) In that runoff, Kirkpatrick pulled 58 percent of the vote to Triebsch\u2019s 42 percent. The latter was woefully underfunded. Our number-crunching friend tells us that Ossoff doesn\u2019t have to win Cobb to pull out a victory tonight. But he does have to do better than Triebsch. By his calculation, if you see Ossoff pulling 45 percent or better in Cobb \u2013 he\u2019ll win. If he\u2019s pulling only 43 percent \u2013 Ossoff could still win, but it\u2019ll be much closer. If Handel keeps Ossoff under 43 percent in Cobb, then the night is probably hers, and Republicans retain a congressional seat they\u2019ve held since Newt Gingrich was a young man.\n\nUpdated at 2:30 p.m. -- Photos from the front\n\nOur AJC photographers have been on the ground today snapping pictures of voters and the two campaigns. Check out a photo gallery of their work here.\n\nUpdated at 2:25 p.m. \u2013 Voters weigh in on being in the spotlight\n\nThe voters of the 6th District have been clobbered with non-stop attack ads on television, radio and in the mail for months now. Many have been on the receiving end of campaign canvassers at their front door several times over.\n\nIt's hard to overstate how many of the locals we talked to who are anxious for things to get back to normal.\n\nTake Keiko Coghlin of Sandy Springs. She told our intern Martha Michael that she voted for Karen Handel because Jon Ossoff\u2019s campaign \u201cjust drove me crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey called our house, stuffed up our mailbox, they even rang our doorbell. We were really turned off by that,\u201d Coghlin said. \u201cFor anyone that was on the fence in this election, this kind of stuff really pushed you towards Handel.\u201d\n\nSome of Jon Ossoff\u2019s supporters said they see the national attention as energizing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived in Cobb County since 1998. I\u2019ve taught here. And I know how deep the conservative roots run here. But I\u2019ve been so encouraged by the way people have come out and come together,\u201d said Karen Thorpe, a former teacher who came out to wave signs for Ossoff in Roswell on Tuesday morning. \u201cThis is democracy at its finest.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 1:55 p.m. \u2013 Could weather dampen turnout?\n\n6th District voters who haven\u2019t already dashed to the polls should plan on getting very wet when they do cast their ballots, our colleague Ben Brasch reports. And it\u2019s only supposed to get worse as the day goes on.\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued weather advisories and flash flood warnings for the region, the latter of which is expected to last until after polls close.\n\nWe don\u2019t have a great sense yet re: how that will impact turnout yet. In general, though, rain tends to dampen turnout which has historically hurt Democrats. Ossoff\u2019s campaign said it\u2019s confident it has the edge in terms of voter enthusiasm, which can help make up for any voters staying home due to the weather.\n\nMeanwhile, Georgia GOP Chairman John Watson tweeted this about the fain:\n\nUpdated at 1:35 p.m. -- DeKalb voting hours extended\n\nAnd just like that, DeKalb County officials have received permission to extend voting hours at two precincts for 30 more minutes tonight. Torres has more.\n\nUpdated at 1:15 p.m. \u2013 Fairly smooth at the polls so far\n\nIt\u2019s been relatively smooth sailing so far at 6th District polling places, Torres reports.\n\nVoters at two polling locations in DeKalb County reported slow check-ins earlier this morning, which could cause local officials to seek an extension of voting hours.\n\nOtherwise, it\u2019s been pretty calm here, outside of the very ominous storm clouds that have hovered over the region this afternoon.\n\nFulton County\u2019s top elections official vowed that voting would go smoothly today, the AJC\u2019s Arielle Kass reports. During the first round of 6th District voting on April 18, it took Fulton County until after 2 a.m. to count the votes as the county juggled a number of separate database and an issue popped up with a memory card in Roswell.\n\nUpdated at 12:40 p.m. -- Handel casts her ballot\n\nIt was nothing if not a circus at an orthodox church in Roswell as Republican Karen Handel cast her vote.\n\nDozens of reporters and camera crews scrambled for a view of the candidate as she quickly filled out her ballot. After the deed was done, Handel repeatedly mentioned how her opponent couldn't do the same.\n\n\"I've lived here for nearly 25 years, and I think that's going to make a big difference to the voters in this district,\" she said.\n\nOssoff lives next door in the 5th District. The Democrat said it's so his fianc\u00e9 can walk to work at Emory University hospital. Congressional candidates don't have to live in the districts they represent, but Ossoff said he plans to move to the 6th if he wins.\n\nHandel predicted today's race \"is essentially a jump ball.\"\n\nShe was nearly drowned out by roughly 50 Ossoff supporters as they chanted \"flip the 6th! flip the 6th!\" at the entrance of the polling place.\n\nUpdated at 12:20 p.m. -- Ossoff's final pitch\n\nDemocrat Jon Ossoff held a host of rah-rah rallies across the district Tuesday, including an event in Sandy Springs with about two dozen supporters \u2013 and just as many reporters.\n\n\u201cThis is about this community at an extraordinary moment of time, a coalition that we have built that\u2019s founded on the core values that bring people together in this community,\u201d he said, giving his volunteers a closing nudge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s close. And those of us in the room right now \u2013 and I know you\u2019ve been working hard for hours, days, months \u2013 this is the final push. Let\u2019s give it everything we\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\nUpdated at 12:05 p.m. -- Recovering lawmaker gets involved\n\nU.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., tweeted his endorsement of Karen Handel in today\u2019s contest, writing that she is a \u201cgreat candidate.\u201d\n\nThe 6th District race took a tenser turn after Scalise and other Republican legislators, including Georgia Rep. Barry Loudermilk, were ambushed at a baseball field in suburban Washington last week. Scalise, the House's No. 3 Republican, was shot in the hip, suffering severe damage in his internal organs, and is in critical condition at a local D.C. hospital.\n\nHandel and several neighbors soon thereafter received a threatening letter with a white powder later deemed to be non-hazardous by the FBI. Jon Ossoff hired a security detail amid a spate of unspecified threats targeting him. Both condemned an attack ad by a fringe GOP super PAC that sought to politicize the shooting.\n\nIt\u2019s uncertain whether the shooting will help shore up votes for either candidate, but a WSB poll released Monday showed a majority of voters who had yet to cast their ballots said they had no effect on their decision.\n\nAbout one-third of election-day voters said the attack would make them \u201cmore likely\u201d to cast their ballots, and most of those were Republican.\n\nOriginal post -- 12:00 p.m.\n\nIt's election day in the north Atlanta suburbs.\n\nWelcome to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's live blog. We'll be tracking all things 6th District special election throughout this rainy day (and night) in this closely-watched nail-biter of a contest between Republican Karen Handel and Democrat Jon Ossoff.\n\nThe two candidates are duking it out for Tom Price's former U.S. House seat, which has been vacant since the six-term lawmaker was sworn in as Health and Human Services secretary on Feb. 12. The race has attracted a deluge of outside money and attention in the intervening four months. By our tally, more than $50 million has been spent so far, making it by far the most expensive contest in the history of the U.S. House.\n\nFueling the intense outside interest is the idea that the special election will tell the country something about support for President Donald Trump (the commander-in-chief tweeted about the race several times on Monday and Tuesday), Democrats' nascent resistance movement and the House GOP's health care overhaul heading into next year's high-stakes midterm election. Both candidates insist their focus is on DeKalb, Fulton and Cobb counties, the affluent and well-educated suburbs that will decide their fate Tuesday.\n\nCheck back here throughout the day for the latest updates on the candidates, the turnout, the results and the reaction.
