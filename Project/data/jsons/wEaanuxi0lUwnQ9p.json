Maybe not .\nRand Paul ( as in , Dr. Rand Paul ) had the hardest time of all navigating the cross currents of the vaccine issue .\nHe came out squarely against mandatory vaccination , which probably appealed to libertarian-leaning primary voters , but then he said he had `` heard of '' children who wound up with `` profound mental disorders '' after vaccinations .

Here are five things the vaccine politics kerfuffle of 2015 tells us about the emerging field of presidential candidates for 2016.\n\n1. Vaccination politics are a problem for Republicans \u2014 not Democrats.\n\nConservatives have been pointing out that parents who refuse to vaccinate their kids are more likely to be rich, liberal \"purists\" who buy organic food for their kids than anti-government Tea Partiers. There is some evidence for that argument. While all 50 states require vaccinations for kids before entering school, some states allow parents to opt out of vaccinating their children based on \"personal beliefs.\" And dark blue California, where the current measles outbreak began, is one of those \"opt-out\" states. The red states of Mississippi and West Virginia do not allow exemptions \u2014 and they have the highest rates of immunization.\n\nAnd yes, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton did both raise questions about whether vaccines might have a link to autism.

The GOP is where skepticism about climate science is strongest. So is support for teaching alternatives to evolution. Republicans are more likely to see issues like mandatory vaccines as a question of individual liberty. And that's why you saw so many potential 2016 GOP candidates flailing about this week as they tried to reach out to the conservative base of their party and appeal to the mainstream at the same time.\n\n2. When you're hot, you're hot.\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is having a great month. He got rave reviews for his appearance at Rep. Steve King's Iowa Freedom Summit. And he was unequivocal about the need for parents to vaccinate their kids. No need for him to pander to the anti-vaccinators!\n\nAnd Jeb Bush \u2014 widely considered the top \"establishment\" pick of the field \u2014 wisely stayed out of it when asked about vaccines in Detroit on Wednesday. \"Parents have a responsibility to make sure their children are protected.

Maybe not.\n\n3. It's not easy being a libertarian.\n\nRand Paul (as in, Dr. Rand Paul) had the hardest time of all navigating the cross currents of the vaccine issue.\n\nHe came out squarely against mandatory vaccination, which probably appealed to libertarian-leaning primary voters, but then he said he had \"heard of\" children who wound up with \"profound mental disorders\" after vaccinations. Although he later posted a picture on Twitter of himself getting a booster shot, he earned a round of scathing editorials including one in the Washington Post which questioned his \"judgement and fitness for higher office.\" The Post included New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in that assessment.\n\n4. Chris Christie can't catch a break.\n\nThe charismatic, straight-talking Christie was once considered the answer to the GOP's problems. But that was a long time ago.\n\nThis week, coverage of Christie refusing to talk to the press on his trip to Europe followed stories about his penchant for luxury travel. Christie had no qualms about placing a mandatory quarantine on health workers who may have come in contact with Ebola, but on vaccines he was all over the place.\n\n\"You know, it's much more important what you think as a parent than what you think as a public official,\" the governor of New Jersey said.

Being the only grandmother in the race has its privileges.\n\nHillary Clinton weighed in with a tweet that poked the \"vaccine deniers\":\n\nThe science is clear: The earth is round, the sky is blue, and #vaccineswork. Let's protect all our kids. #GrandmothersKnowBest\n\nAnytime Clinton can stand apart from the Republican free for all, instead of being their one and only punching bag, is a good day for her.
