Show Hide Background Robert S Mueller III, 74, is a former FBI director who was appointed by George W Bush and held over by Barack Obama beyond his 10-year term. The term extension required special congressional action which the Senate approved 100-0. Previously, Mueller held two different US attorney posts and was an assistant attorney general in the George HW Bush administration.\n\nSpecial counsel Mueller was appointed special counsel in May 2017, eight days after Trump fired FBI director James Comey. A special counsel is a prosecutor appointed in extraordinary circumstances or in cases of conflicts of interest within the justice department. In this case, there was a need for someone to investigate the Russian matter who was not appointed by or beholden to Trump. Mueller\u2019s team of 17 lawyers operates independently of, but (ideally) in cooperation with, Congress, which has three committees conducting investigations in parallel to Mueller. Mueller is expected to submit a report to Congress and may bring criminal charges separately. Mueller has a sizeable budget and an open-ended term. He is specifically authorized to investigate \u201cany links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump\u201d plus any matters that \u201cmay arise directly from the investigation\u201d. He has the power to prosecute federal crimes. Can he be replaced? In theory, William Barr, the new attorney general, could fire Mueller. Barr, who once criticised Mueller's case as \u201cfatally misconceived\u201d, was asked during his confirmation hearing if he would fire the special counsel without good cause and replied: \"I would not carry out that instruction.\" Although, if Trump wanted to fire Mueller, and Barr was unwilling, Trump could replace Barr. Trump's view Trump has said Mueller \u201cis very, very good friends with [James] Comey, which is very bothersome\u201d but also said \u201cRobert Mueller is an honorable man.\u201d Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP\n\nSessions has long been a flashpoint in the Russia investigation. He announced in March 2017 that he would recuse himself from any role in it after it was revealed that he had two meetings with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States, during the 2016 campaign. The former Alabama senator endorsed Trump in February 2016 and was a key surrogate during the campaign.\n\n\n\nThe attorney general\u2019s decision to recuse himself angered Trump, who has since repeatedly criticized Sessions.
