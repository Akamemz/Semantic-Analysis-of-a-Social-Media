The regulations are distinct from other state laws making their way through court challenges that would ban abortions early in a pregnancy .\nLouisiana abortion providers and a district judge who initially heard the case said one or maybe two of the state \u2019 s three abortion clinics would have to close under the new law . There would be at most two doctors who could meet its requirements , they said .\nBut the appeals court in New Orleans rejected those claims , doubting that any clinics would have to close and saying the doctors had not tried hard enough to establish relationships with local hospitals .\nIn January , the full appeals court voted 9-6 not to get involved in the case , setting up the Supreme Court appeal .\nThe Hope Medical Group clinic in Shreveport , Louisiana , and two doctors whose identities are not revealed said in their appeal that the justices should strike down the law without even holding arguments because the decision so clearly conflicts with the Texas ruling from 2016 .\nThere also was no action on a third abortion-related appeal that involves a challenge to a Chicago ordinance that stops protesters from getting within 8 feet ( 2.4 meters ) of people entering abortion clinics and other health care facilities without their consent .\nAnti-abortion activists had challenged the Chicago law as a violation of their free speech rights .
