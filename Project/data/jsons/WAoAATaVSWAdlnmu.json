    "content": "Donald Trump Jr , the eldest son of the US president , was in direct communication with WikiLeaks in the crucial final stages of the 2016 presidential election , a new leak of private correspondence from inside the Trump circle reveals .\nThe younger Trump exchanged direct messages with the WikiLeaks account on Twitter between 20 September and 12 October 2016 . Copies of the correspondence were handed to congressional investigators by Trump Jr \u2019 s lawyers and subsequently obtained by the Atlantic magazine .\nHelp make Julian Assange Australia 's US ambassador , WikiLeaks urged Trump Jr Read more\nThe communication occurred at a highly sensitive moment for both the Trump presidential campaign and for WikiLeaks , just weeks before election day and at the height of WikiLeaks \u2019 publication of hacked emails belonging to senior Democratic figures at the instigation , US intelligence agencies allege , of the Russian government .\nThe most politically explosive communication between the two parties , according to the Atlantic , came on and after 12 October 2016 .\n\u201c Hey Donald , great to see you and your dad talking about our publications , \u201d the WikiLeaks account , @ WikiLeaks , said to Trump Jr two days after his father had proclaimed at a campaign rally : \u201c I love WikiLeaks ! \u201d\n\u201c Strongly suggest your dad tweets this link if he mentions us . There \u2019 s many great stories the press are missing and we \u2019 re sure some of your follows [ sic ] will find it , \u201d the message continued .\nThe message went on to offer a link to wlsearch.tk \u2013 a search tool that facilitates the exploration of the database of leaked emails from John Podesta , Hillary Clinton \u2019 s 2016 campaign chairman , that WikiLeaks had by then begun to publish .\nJulia Ioffe , author of the Atlantic article , writes that Trump Jr did not reply to the WikiLeaks message . But two days later , on 14 October , he did tweet that same link to wlsearch.tk , encouraging \u201c those who have the time to read about all the corruption and hypocrisy \u201d exposed by the WikiLeaks emails .\nDonald Trump Jr. ( @ DonaldJTrumpJr ) For those who have the time to read about all the corruption and hypocrisy all the @ wikileaks emails are right here : https : //t.co/SGcEeM9rCS\n\u2588\u2588\u2588 contacted WikiLeaks , which referred to a Twitter post by the group \u2019 s founder , Julian Assange ; he suggested that the Atlantic had selectively edited the messages .\nJulian Assange \ud83d\udd39 ( @ JulianAssange ) Full text of alleged DMs with context provides a different reading , unsurprisingly . https : //t.co/dbwIKXWp74\nAssange also wrote that the messages from WikiLeaks , including ones urging Trump Jr to release his father \u2019 s tax returns through the organisation , showed its \u201c chutzpah \u201d .\nA lawyer for Trump Jr told the Atlantic : \u201c We can say with confidence that we have no concerns about these documents and any questions raised about them have been easily answered in the appropriate forum . \u201d\nOn Monday evening , Trump Jr tweeted what he said were copies of the \u201c entire chain of messages with @ wikileaks \u201d .\nThe first contact from WikiLeaks was made on 20 September 2016 , the magazine reports . In it the open information website informed Trump Jr that a new political action committee called \u201c putintrump \u201d was about to launch .\nTrump Jr replied the following morning : \u201c Off the record I don \u2019 t know who that is , but I \u2019 ll ask around . \u201d\nAccording to leaked information obtained by the Atlantic , Trump Jr shared the news that WikiLeaks had been in touch with him with several members of the inner campaign team . Among those he allegedly told were Steve Bannon , then chief executive of the Trump presidential campaign , as well as the candidate \u2019 s son-in-law Jared Kushner .\nOn 3 October there was a further exchange through Twitter in which WikiLeaks encouraged the Trump team to publicise a comment by Clinton about wanting to \u201c just drone \u201d the head of WikiLeaks , Julian Assange .\n\u201c Already did that earlier today , \u201d Trump Jr replied , according to the Atlantic .\nTrump Jr says he was open to intel on Clinton 's 'fitness ' at Russia meeting Read more\nSoon after , the businessman sent a second DM to WikiLeaks asking to know more about an upcoming leak from WikiLeaks that had been teased by Roger Stone , the Trump-supporting political agitator .\nAccording to the Atlantic the information flow continued until as late as July this year , although after 12 October 2016 it was entirely in one direction \u2013 after that date the younger Trump did not respond to any approaches . Beyond that point , the leak becomes more revealing about WikiLeaks and its maverick founder Assange , holed up in the Ecuardorian embassy in London , where he has lived since 2012 , than about the circle of the US president .\nThe most revelatory detail in that regard dates back to 21 October 2016 when the WikiLeaks account \u2013 presumably controlled by Assange himself , though the identity of the correspondent is unknown \u2013 contacted Trump Jr urging him to allow WikiLeaks to publish his father \u2019 s tax returns . WikiLeaks suggested the move would be positive as it would undermine suggestions that the organisation was in the pocket of the Kremlin .\n\u201c If we publish [ the tax returns ] it will dramatically improve the perception of our impartiality , \u201d WikiLeaks says . \u201c That means the vast amount of stuff that we are publishing on Clinton will have much higher impact , because it won \u2019 t be perceived as coming from a \u2018 pro-Trump \u2019 \u2018 pro-Russia \u2019 source . \u201d\nOn election day itself , 8 November , WikiLeaks contacted Trump Jr to make the extraordinary suggestion that should his father lose the contest , as was then widely expected , he should refuse to concede the race and instead turn the spotlight on the media for \u201c rigging \u201d the result .\nProfile Donald Trump Jr Show Hide Born 31 December 1977 in Manhattan 31 December 1977 in Manhattan Career After brief stint bartending in Aspen , he moved back to New York to join the Trump Organization , supervising Trump Park Avenue and other projects .
