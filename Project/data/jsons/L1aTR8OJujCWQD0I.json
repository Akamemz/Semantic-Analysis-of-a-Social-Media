Bernard Sanders of Vermont .\n\u201c It is such an honor to be also running in alliance with the Bernie Sanders movement , \u201d Ms. Stein said to thunderous applause at the Green Party Presidential Nominating Convention in Houston . \u201c We are Bernie Green ! \u201d\nTo nobody \u2019 s surprise , Ms. Stein , a Harvard-educated physician and prohibitive front-runner , won the nomination Saturday at the University of Houston . She will run on a ticket with human rights activist Ajamu Baraka .\nThat Mr. Sanders has endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton matters little to the Greens , a third party poised to make an enormous electoral leap in November if Ms. Stein can persuade Mr. Sanders \u2019 ground troops to line up behind her instead of staying home or voting Democrat .\nThe Greens suffered a setback Friday when a federal court ruled that the Commission on Presidential Debates has the right to exclude third-party candidates such as Ms. Stein and Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson from televised forums if they don \u2019 t meet polling criteria .\nThe ruling all but guarantees that Ms. Stein will be excluded from the debates , given that the commission requires participants to reach at least 15 percent in the polls . A McClatchy-Maris survey released Friday shows Ms. Stein with 6 percent , and even that is a recent high-water polling mark .\nEven so , the Greens have reason for optimism . For one , that 6 percent figure is far higher than the 0.36 percent that Ms. Stein earned as the party \u2019 s presidential candidate in 2012 .\nFor another , Ms. Stein has new high-profile allies in former Ivy League professor Cornel West and WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange .\nMr. Assange , who released 20,000 hacked emails last month showing Democratic National Committee officials plotting against the Sanders campaign , urged left-of-center voters via live feed Saturday not to cast a lesser-of-two-evils vote for Mrs. Clinton .\n\u201c What the Clinton campaign is doing at the moment is trying to say , \u2018 Well , OK , yes , maybe we \u2019 re committed to arms dealers and to Saudi Arabia , and yes , maybe we subverted the integrity of the Democratic primary , etc. , etc. , but you \u2019 ll just have to swallow that . You \u2019 ll just have to swallow that , or else you \u2019 ll get Donald Trump , \u2019 \u201d he said .\n\u201c That \u2019 s a form of extortion , \u201d Mr. Assange told the enthusiastic crowd from the Ecuadorean Embassy in London , where he has lived since being granted asylum amid sexual assault charges .\nThat message may be taking hold with voters like Angelica Duanes , a Sanders supporter from Los Angeles who attended the convention .\n\u201c I am still a Democrat but I guess you could say we \u2019 re a flight risk , so we \u2019 re really looking at our options now , \u201d Ms. Duanes told Russia Today television . \u201c We really can \u2019 t stand with Hillary Clinton as our nominee . We definitely can \u2019 t stand with Donald Trump . So at this point , we \u2019 re looking at what our options are . \u201d\nAs for the argument that a vote against Mrs. Clinton is a vote for Mr. Trump , Ms. Duanes said that \u2019 s the Democratic Party \u2019 s fault , not hers .\n\u201c We feel that they had an opportunity to choose a stronger candidate that would definitely beat Donald Trump come November , and they did not , \u201d said Ms. Duanes . \u201c At this point , we \u2019 re not going to be influenced by fear tactics and the boogeyman narrative that they \u2019 re painting . We \u2019 re looking for someone to vote for rather than vote against . \u201d\nThe Sanders loss , combined with the evidence of DNC favoritism , has given the Greens their best opportunity for a strong showing since well-known consumer advocate Ralph Nader headed the party ticket in 2000 .\n\u201c We are at such an incredibly powerful , unprecedented moment in history , \u201d Ms. Stein told delegates . \u201c We have an incredible opportunity , we have an incredible responsibility to stand up and lead the way forward to the transformative change . \u201d\nThis year \u2019 s presidential election \u201c really is that moment that so many of us I think have dedicated our lives to creating and that we never thought we \u2019 d see actually happen in our lifetimes , \u201d she said . \u201c We are closer to that now than we \u2019 ve ever been . \u201d\nMs. Stein called the election a \u201c perfect storm , because the American people are tired of a rigged economy of the rigged political system that keeps us trapped in that rigged economy . \u201d\nBut an effort by Ms. Stein and her Libertarian counterpart to break through one element of that \u201c rigged political system \u201d failed Friday when U.S. District Judge Rosemary M. Collyer turned away their challenge to the right of the Commission on Presidential Debates to exclude them .\nJudge Collyer ruled that the commission is a private entity , not a \u201c public forum , \u201d and rejected arguments by Mr. Johnson and Ms. Green that the commission is essentially a government actor , performing an important role in U.S. democracy , and therefore should be subject to public oversight .\n\u201c This court could not require defendants to include plaintiffs in the debates because such an order would violate the First Amendment prohibition on forced speech and forced association , \u201d Judge Collyer found .\nMr. Johnson \u2019 s campaign said it was disappointed with the ruling and spotted \u201c several serious flaws \u201d that could lead to an appeal .\nThe Green convention came as a reminder that the Green platform isn \u2019 t for everyone , even progressives . Ms. Stein has long taken a hard line on Israel , referring in her remarks Saturday to \u201c war crimes \u201d committed by Israeli troops in the \u201c occupation \u201d against Palestinians .\nAt the same time , she played up issues popular with Sanders voters , such as opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership , banning hydraulic fracturing , erasing student loan debt , instating a single-payer health care system , releasing nonviolent prisoners convicted of drug offenses , and legalizing marijuana .\nMs. Stein also dropped Mr. Sanders \u2019 name repeatedly in several speeches and interviews during the three-day convention , even though the senator was nowhere to be found .\nHer supporters chanted , \u201c Jill , not Hill , \u201d although polling shows Mrs. Clinton is more likely to attract Sanders voters than is Ms. Stein .\nA CNN/ORC survey released Aug. 1 , two days after the Democratic National Convention , showed that 69 percent of Sanders supporters now favor Mrs. Clinton , versus 13 percent for Ms. Stein , 10 percent for Mr. Johnson and 3 percent for Mr. Trump .\nThe figures represent a 5 percent increase in support for Mrs. Clinton , within the poll \u2019 s margin of error , but also a 7 percent boost for Ms. Stein .\nOddly enough , Mr. Trump \u2019 s decline in the polls could wind up benefiting the Greens \u2014 and hurting the Clinton campaign \u2014 by reducing the perceived urgency among left-of-center voters to vote Democratic in order to defeat the Republican ticket .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a cost to violating principles , even if there \u2019 s also a cost to yourself , even if you don \u2019 t like the risk \u2014 which seems to be getting very small \u2014 the risk that Donald Trump becomes president , \u201d Mr. Assange said .\nFor those still unconvinced , Ms. Stein argued that voting for one candidate in order to avoid the other has \u201c brought us everything we were afraid of . \u201d\nMs. Stein had urged Mr. Sanders to step in and run as the Green Party candidate .
