It implored the countries of the world to step up their actions to protect the wildlife that remains \u2014 like the endangered gray wolves and caribou that roam the United States , or the threatened polar bear in the Arctic .\nOn Monday , the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced they were pushing through changes to the Endangered Species Act that will , in effect , weaken protections for species , and possibly give industry more leeway to develop areas where threatened animals live .

And now the rules go into effect in 30 days after they are officially published in the federal register ( which the New York Times expects will happen this week ) .\nThe Trump administration \u2019 s alterations don \u2019 t change the letter of the ESA , which was passed in 1973 during the Nixon administration .

Discretion is not a problem per se , but as the Washington Post explained last year , this could mean that in determining protections for plants and animals , regulators could ignore the far-flung effects of climate change that may occur several decades from now .
