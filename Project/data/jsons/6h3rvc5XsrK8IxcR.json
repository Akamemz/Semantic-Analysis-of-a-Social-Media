With 97 percent of the expected vote counted , Sanders had 26 percent of the vote , while former South Bend , Indiana , Mayor Pete Buttigieg had 24 percent . The big surprise of the night was Sen.

For example , \u201c very liberal \u201d voters made up just 21 percent of the New Hampshire Democratic electorate on Tuesday , and Sanders easily beat out Warren to win that group .
