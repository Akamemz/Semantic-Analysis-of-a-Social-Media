    "content": "President Donald Trump \u2019 s first official budget document includes massive changes to the one-third of federal spending going to \u201c discretionary \u201d programs . Programs to mitigate climate change are cut or eliminated across the government . Programs to assist the poor are slashed . And while almost every department would face large cuts , three would see sizable increases in spending : Defense , Homeland Security , and Veterans Affairs .\nThe impact of the cuts and hikes laid out in the document would be massive . Trump wants to fund a border wall , deportation raids , a hiring spree for Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement , and purchases of new F-35 fighter jets and a variety of Navy vessels . And it would dramatically hamper enforcement of environmental and labor regulations , end grant and loan programs for clean energy and disadvantaged regions , and significantly reduce funding for biomedical research .\nThe document is a \u201c skinny \u201d budget that ignores taxes and entitlements like Social Security , Medicare , Medicaid , and food stamps . It only specifies changes to \u201c discretionary \u201d spending by agencies . In total , this is about a third of the overall federal budget ; non-defense discretionary is about 16 percent .\nThe budget will not pass in full , and provisions are already provoking political backlash on Capitol Hill . It will be up to Congress to actually implement spending policy ; Trump can only offer suggestions . But the document is revealing and important nonetheless . It gives a clear signal of the administration \u2019 s priorities on agency spending , and signals that it will support any efforts by Congress to crack down on international programs , environmental protection , and anti-poverty programs .\nEven given its somewhat limited purview , though , the consequences are massive :\n$ 639 billion in total defense spending , including both base budget and Overseas Contingency Operations ( the war budget ) \u2014 a $ 52 billion increase .\nIncreases of 7 percent and 6 percent , respectively , for the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Veterans Affairs . That includes funding for a border wall , $ 1.5 billion more to remove undocumented immigrants , $ 314 million to hire more Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers , and a $ 667 million reduction in grants to state and local governments , including FEMA grants .\nA 31 percent cut in the Environmental Protection Agency budget , from $ 8.2 billion down to $ 5.7 billion , the lowest level ( after adjusting for inflation ) in 40 years and below where even congressional Republicans wanted it . More than 50 programs would be eliminated , as would 3,200 jobs . Specifically , the budget `` discontinues funding for the Clean Power Plan , international climate change programs , climate change research and partnership programs , and related efforts , \u201d and reduces Superfund cleanup funding .\nA 28 percent cut in the State Department budget , with particularly harsh cuts to the US Agency for International Development ( USAID ) . The Global Climate Change Initiative and UN climate change programs would see funding cut off , other UN funding including peacekeeping would be cut , and development banks like the World Bank would see $ 650 million in cuts over three years .\nSignificant cuts to just about every other department , including 21 percent to Agriculture and Labor , 18 percent to Health and Human Services , 16 percent to Commerce , 14 percent to Education , 13 percent to Housing and Urban Development , 13 percent to Transportation , and 12 percent to Interior . The Education Department would get $ 1.4 billion for new school choice programs , including private school vouchers , but see cuts to before-school , after-school , and summer programs , a $ 2.4 billion teacher professional development program , and need-based grants that help with college tuition .\nHuge cuts to medical and science research spending , including a $ 6 billion or 18 percent reduction in the National Institutes for Health budget , a $ 900 million cut to the Energy Department 's Office of Science , a $ 250 million cut to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration grants for research and education , and eliminating the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy .\nTotal elimination of the National Endowment for the Arts , the National Endowment for the Humanities , the Corporation for Public Broadcasting , the Legal Services Corporation , the United States Institute of Peace , and 14 other agencies .\nAmong other goals , the budget appears designed to totally unwind the Obama administration \u2019 s government-wide commitment to combating climate change .\nThe antipathy toward climate change programs begins with the EPA , where funding cuts focus on President Obama \u2019 s Clean Power Plan , climate change research , international climate change programs , and so forth . But it doesn \u2019 t end there .\nThe State Department cuts also make a point to end the Global Climate Change Initiative and other international efforts on the issue . The Commerce Department reductions includes significant cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) , one of the major agencies conducting climate change research , and the budget outlines relatively mild cuts to NASA that target its Earth science programs .\nThe budget outline eliminates funding for TIGER , a grant-making program in the Transportation Department , most of whose funding has gone to `` rail , transit and bicycle projects designed to reduce carbon emissions as well as congestion , '' per Politico 's Michael Grunwald . And the Energy Department budget eliminates two programs providing loans for companies working on clean energy and clean vehicles , respectively , as well as ARPA-Energy , a widely praised agency created in the 2009 stimulus bill that provides early-stage funding for clean energy research and development that venture capital often won \u2019 t .\nThe budget document is literally titled , \u201c America First , \u201d so it \u2019 s perhaps not a shock that international programs come in for particularly large cuts . At the State Department , educational and cultural exchange programs other the Fulbright Program would be eliminated . The US commitment to international organizations ranging from the UN to the World Bank would be drawn down . Even military aid abroad would be shifted from grants to loans as a cost-saving measure .\nBut the cuts extend beyond State and USAID . In the Department of Agriculture , for instance , the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education program is eliminated \u2014 a program that aims to combat world hunger , helped feed more than 2 million people in 2016 , and won the 2008 World Food Prize for the former US senators who pushed for its passage .\nThe National Institutes of Health 's only division devoted to global health , is eliminated . The Bureau of International Labor Affairs in the Labor Department would see its grant program eliminated .\nAt State and USAID , the Fulbright Program would be preserved , but other Educational and Cultural Exchange programs would be cut . The budget insists it `` provides sufficient resources to maintain current commitments and all current patient levels '' for PEPFAR , the federal government 's premier anti-HIV/AIDS program , `` maintains funding for malaria programs , '' and `` meets US commitments to the Global Fund for AIDS , Tuberculosis , and Malaria . '' But it also states that it `` refocuses economic and development assistance to countries of greatest strategic importance to the US . \u201d\nIn other words : While global health funding may continue to go to places of greatest need , other development aid will be redirected to focus less on need and more on US strategy . Already , though , aid dollars are allocated based more on geopolitics than humanitarian necessity .\nMost of the major programs for the poor are mandatory spending programs , and so they \u2019 re not part of the skinny budget : Medicaid , SNAP/food stamps , the Earned Income Tax Credit , Supplemental Security Income , and other programs that help low-income Americans get by .\nStill , even given those constraints , Trump \u2019 s budget outline does what it can to reduce anti-poverty spending . The Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women , Infants , and Children ( WIC ) , which directly provides baby formula , healthy foods , nutrition counseling , and more to poor mothers with young children , would see funding reduced to $ 6.2 billion , from $ 6.4 billion .\nThe Legal Services Corporation , which provides funding for legal aid groups to support the poor in civil cases ( suing a landlord for a wrongful eviction or a boss for wrongful termination , say ) , would be totally eliminated . The Community Development Block Grant program , which assists local and state governments with programs like Meals on Wheels , infrastructure improvements , and the like , would go away entirely .\nSo too would the Choice Neighborhoods program , a neighborhood revitalization program aimed at poor areas , and the HOME Investment Partnerships Program , a block-grant for state and local governments to spend on affordable housing programs . Also gone : the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program ( LIHEAP ) and the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant , which provides financial assistance for poor college students .\nThese cuts aren \u2019 t as huge as the mandatory ones likely forthcoming in May \u2014 or , for that matter , included in the health care bill Congress is currently weighing . But they \u2019 re what would happen if you went through the discretionary budget with a fine-tooth comb looking for every program designed to help poor people , and then eliminated them all .",
