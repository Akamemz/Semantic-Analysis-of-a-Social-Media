    "content": "The front end of a monster blizzard that 's expected to impact more than 70 million people began dumping snow on the nation 's capital Friday , as an army of plows fought to keep open major arteries and transportation systems long enough to allow thousands of workers to get home before the worst hit .\nOfficials say Washington 's Metro subway system is set to shut down entirely late Friday night and remain closed through Sunday for the safety of workers and riders . Underground stations usually stay open during major snowstorms .

Some 2,900 flights were canceled for Friday , most in Charlotte and Raleigh , North Carolina . Thousands more were delayed .\nMore than 3,300 flights were canceled for Saturday , including all flights into and out of Philadelphia International Airport . All major airlines have issued waivers for travel over the weekend , allowing passengers to rebook onto earlier or later flights to avoid the storms .\nThe storm is expected to hit areas around the nation 's capital the hardest , dropping more than 2 feet of snow .

In New York City , 79 subway trains will have `` scraper shoes '' to reduce icing on rails , the Metropolitan Transit Authority said .\nConditions quickly became treacherous as the storm moved northeast . Arkansas and Tennessee got eight inches ; Kentucky got more than a foot , and states across the Deep South grappled with icy , snow-covered roads and power outages . At least eight people died in traffic fatalities in the dangerous weather .\nThe National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings stretching from northern Virginia to parts of New York 's Long Island , where the U.S. Coast Guard warned seas could swell up to 18 feet .
