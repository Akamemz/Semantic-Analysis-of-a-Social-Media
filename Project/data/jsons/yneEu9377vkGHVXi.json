    "content": "The classroom of the future probably wo n't be led by a robot with arms and legs , but it may be guided by a digital brain .\nIt may look like this : one room , about the size of a basketball court ; more than 100 students , all plugged into a laptop ; and 15 teachers and teaching assistants .\nThis is n't just the future , it 's the sixth grade math class at David Boody Jr. High School in Brooklyn , near Coney Island . Beneath all the human buzz , something other than humans is running the show : algorithms .\nThe kind of complex computer calculations that drive our Google searches or select what we see on our Facebook pages .\nAlgorithms choose which students sit together . Algorithms measure what the children know and how well they know it . They choose what problems the children should work on and provide teachers with the next lesson to teach .\nThis combination of human capital and technology is called `` blended learning . '' And regardless of whether it makes you uneasy , the program , Teach to One , seems to be serving Boody Jr. High well . A recent study of the 15 schools using Teach to One , had mixed results , but showed they are outperforming their peers nationally on average .\n`` It can be used as an effective tool , but so far it has had moderate and unstable effects on student performance , '' said Justin Reich , a researcher at Harvard who has reviewed the study .\nHe believes Teach to One can mechanize some of the more mundane parts of teaching , like grading and assessing whether a student has mastered a topic . But , he added , it also ends up teaching to standardized tests and does n't work better than some non-digital interventions .\nWhen these sixth graders get to class , they either log onto their laptop or check a monitor at the front of the room . It tells each student where to go \u2014 the room is quasi-divided by book shelves and small dividers into 10 sections , with names like `` Botanical Gardens '' and `` Brighton Beach . '' The computer also tells them what kind of lesson they 'll do .\nToday , most students in the large room are engaged in individual work on their laptops , lessons called `` Virtual Instruction '' and `` Virtual Reinforcement . '' Still others are engaged in group work , being led by a teacher .\nIn `` Kew Gardens , '' Devon Myers , who has taught for seven years , is conducting what Teach to One calls a `` live investigation . ''\nHe stands silently next to a smart board and clicks a mouse . A tinny voice , a cousin of iPhone 's Siri perhaps , begins the lesson . `` How do you say two-point-zero-five-three ? To read this , break it into two parts , '' commands the disembodied voice from a computer 's speakers .\nSabrina Giagrande , a girl who has already answered several questions , reaches her arm into the sky , like it 's being pulled on and shaken by an invisible force . Myers pushes his disinterested class of 20 , urging someone else to answer , but ultimately defers to Sabrina : `` Two and fifty-three thousandths . ''\n`` In this lesson you 've learned to name decimal numbers through the thousandths by using place value , '' the algorithm 's voice informs the class in a matter-of-fact tone .\nWhether they 've gotten it or not , the algorithm will ultimately find out . At the end of class the kids do a short quiz called an `` exit slip , '' which the algorithm uses to gauge what they 've learned .\nIn five questions , this exit slip gives the algorithm the information it uses to decide which students will be grouped together the next day , and what work each of them will do .\nIn a sixth-grade class , in theory , students might be working on everything from 4th grade level math to 8th grade level math . Around 5 p.m. every day , teachers get an alert telling them how students will be grouped and what lessons they 'll need to teach .\nMany teachers I talked with gave the program cautious praise . Aaron Kaswell , who uses Teach to One at M.S . 88 , another middle school in Brooklyn , says all this sorting frees him up to be a better teacher .
