    "content": "House Republicans voted Thursday to block President Obama 's immigration executive actions , though it was unclear whether the largely symbolic step would be enough to prevent a risky budget stand-off next week .\nThe House voted 219-197 for the bill , by Rep. Ted Yoho , R-Fla. , that declares Obama 's actions `` null and void and without legal effect . ''\nThe legislation is part of a three-step plan by House GOP leaders to both address Obama 's immigration maneuvers and approve a new spending bill to avert a partial government shutdown . Next week , the chamber is set to vote on a bill funding most of the government through fiscal 2015 , and the Department of Homeland Security through early next year . That would tee up a new fight over funding for Obama 's immigration policies when Republicans control both chambers .\nHowever , many conservative lawmakers want to wage that battle now , and use the looming Dec. 11 deadline -- when current government funding expires -- as leverage to defund the immigration plan .\nThey worry Yoho 's legislation is an ineffective tool for doing that , as the stand-alone bill approved Thursday stands little chance of passing the Senate . The White House also has issued a veto threat , calling the bill `` non-sensical . ''\n`` I 'm not happy , '' Rep. Mick Mulvaney , R-S.C. , said . He said he 's concerned that if Republicans do n't fight the immigration policy now , it could send the wrong signal ahead of the new Congress .\nConservative sources indicate there are between 30 and 40 , or more , conservatives who would bolt on any spending bill next week .\n`` There 's a higher risk of more [ members ] bolting , '' said one source . `` Let us sort of vent .
