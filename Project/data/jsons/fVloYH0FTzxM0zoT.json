With a new national security team at his side , Mr. Trump is moving ahead with efforts to dismantle pillars of former President Barack Obama \u2019 s agenda , pushing the boundaries of traditional foreign policy and national-security decision making in the process .\nOn Tuesday , he took his latest such step by dismissing appeals from European allies and pulling out of Mr. Obama \u2019 s 2015 agreement that curbed Iran \u2019 s nuclear program .\n\u201c It \u2019 s the Art of the Deal : Refuse to be bound by existing agreements that are not in America \u2019 s interest .
