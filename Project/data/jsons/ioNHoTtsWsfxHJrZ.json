    "content": "Wilson had been publicly silent since the events of August 9 , when he shot and killed 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson , Missouri . And , even as the grand jury announced its decision not to indict him , he remained silent . He had his attorneys release a statement on his behalf .\nBut on Monday night , St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch released the evidence given to the grand jury , including the interview police did with Wilson in the immediate aftermath of the shooting . And so we got to read , for the first time , Wilson 's full , immediate account of his altercation with Brown .\nI mean that in the literal sense of the term : `` difficult or impossible to believe . '' But I want to be clear here . I 'm not saying Wilson is lying . I 'm not saying his testimony is false . I am saying that the events , as he describes them , are simply bizarre . His story is difficult to believe .\nAt about noon on August 9th , Wilson hears on the radio that there 's a theft in progress at the Ferguson Market . The suspect is a black male in a black shirt .\nMoments later , Wilson sees two young black men walking down the yellow stripe in the center of the street . He pulls over . `` Hey guys , why do n't you walk on the sidewalk ? '' They refuse . `` We 're almost at our destination , '' one of them replies . Wilson tries again . `` But what 's wrong with the sidewalk ? '' he asks .\nBrown 's response to `` what 's wrong with the sidewalk ? `` , as recorded by Wilson , is `` fuck what you have to say . '' Remember , Wilson is a uniformed police officer , in a police car , and Brown is an 18-year-old kid who just committed a robbery . And when asked to use the sidewalk , Wilson says Brown replied , `` Fuck what you have to say . ''\nWilson says Brown replied , `` Fuck what you have to say . ''\nWilson backs his car up and begins to open the door . `` Hey , come here , '' he said to the kid who just cursed at him . He says Brown replied , `` What the fuck you gon na do ? '' And then Brown , in Wilson 's telling , slams the car door closed . Wilson tries to open the door again , tells Brown to get back , and then Brown leans into the vehicle and begins punching him .\nLet 's take a breath and recap . Wilson sees two young black men walking in the middle of the street . He pulls over and politely asks them to use the sidewalk . They refuse . He asks again , still polite . Brown tells Wilson \u2014 again , a uniformed police officer in a police car \u2014 `` fuck what you have to say . '' Wilson stops his car , tries to get out , and Brown slams the car door on him and then begins punching him through the open window .\nWhat happens next is the most unbelievable moment in the narrative . And so it 's probably best that I just quote Wilson 's account at length on it .\nI was doing the , just scrambling , trying to get his arms out of my face and him from grabbing me and everything else . He turned to his ... if he 's at my vehicle , he turned to his left and handed the first subject . He said , `` here , take these . '' He was holding a pack of \u2014 several packs of cigarillos which was just , what was stolen from the Market Store was several packs of cigarillos . He said , `` here , hold these '' and when he did that I grabbed his right arm trying just to control something at that point . Um , as I was holding it , and he came around , he came around with his arm extended , fist made , and went like that straight at my face with his ... a full swing from his left hand .\nSo Brown is punching inside the car . Wilson is scrambling to deflect the blows , to protect his face , to regain control of the situation . And then Brown stops , turns to his left , says to his friend , `` Here , hold these , '' and hands him the cigarillos stolen from Ferguson Market . Then he turns back to Wilson and , with his left hand now freed from holding the contraband goods , throws a haymaker at Wilson .\nEvery bullshit detector in me went off when I read that passage . Which does n't mean that it did n't happen exactly the way Wilson describes . But it is , again , hard to imagine . Brown , an 18-year-old kid holding stolen goods , decides to attack a cop and , while attacking him , stops , hands his stolen goods to his friend , and then returns to the beatdown . It reads less like something a human would do and more like a moment meant to connect Brown to the robbery .\nWilson next recounts his thought process as he reached for a weapon . He considered using his mace , but at such close range , the mace might get in his eyes , too . He does n't carry a taser with a fireable cartridge , but even if he did , `` it probably would n't have hit [ Brown ] anywhere '' . Wilson could n't reach his baton or his flashlight . So he went for his gun .\nBrown sees him go for the gun . And he replies : `` You 're too much of a fucking pussy to shoot me . ''\n`` You 're too much of a fucking pussy to shoot me . ''\nAgain , stop for a moment and think about that . Brown is punching Wilson , sees the terrified cop reaching for his gun , and says `` You 're too much of a fucking pussy to shoot me .
