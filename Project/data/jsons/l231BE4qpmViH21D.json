Nearly three-quarters of Republican voters , 74 percent , surveyed on Saturday said party officials should continue to support Trump . Only 13 percent think the party shouldn \u2019 t back him .\nStill , Hillary Clinton leads Trump in the four-way race for the White House by 4 percentage points , 42 percent to 38 percent , with 8 percent supporting Gary Johnson , 3 percent supporting Jill Stein and 9 percent undecided . Clinton also leads by four in a two-way race , 45 percent to 41 percent .\nOperatives in both parties say they believe it will take several days \u2014 and Sunday night \u2019 s debate at Washington University in St. Louis \u2014 to have the video bake into the public consciousness .\nBut the new \u2588\u2588\u2588/Morning Consult poll is the first scientific survey to gauge voters \u2019 immediate reactions to Trump \u2019 s comments . The technology of Morning Consult \u2019 s Web-panel survey allowed respondents to view both the video in which Trump , off-camera , explicitly describes women who allow him to kiss them and grab their genitals with impunity because of his celebrity \u2014 and Trump \u2019 s subsequent midnight apology video posted early Saturday morning .\nAll poll respondents were showed the video in which Trump converses off-camera with \u201c Access Hollywood \u2019 s \u201d then-anchor Billy Bush ( coincidentally , a cousin of Trump \u2019 s former GOP rival , Jeb Bush ) . Respondents were asked , after the video , to describe how they felt about the clip , on a scale from zero ( very negative ) to 10 ( very positive ) , with 5 defined as \u201c neutral . \u201d\nAn even sharper partisan dynamic existed when voters were asked whether the video gave them a more favorable or less favorable impression of Trump . Among all voters , 61 percent said it made them feel either somewhat or much less favorable toward Trump , while 28 percent said it didn \u2019 t affect their view of Trump ; 8 percent said it made them feel more favorably toward Trump .\nBut just 48 percent of GOP voters said it made them feel less favorably toward Trump , while 36 percent said it didn \u2019 t affect their opinion of Trump .\n\u201c As soon as the news broke , we designed a survey that not only tested voter opinion on Trump \u2019 s comments , but also allowed more than 1,500 voters to react in real time to the video and his apology , \u201d said Morning Consult co-founder and Chief Research Officer Kyle Dropp . \u201c The results show that nearly all voters have heard about the video and most rate it negatively , but Trump 's supporters are not abandoning him right away . \u201d\nVoters completed the survey on Saturday , as GOP lawmakers \u2014 some facing challenging campaigns this fall and others in safe seats or not on the ballot \u2014 raced to announce they either wouldn \u2019 t support Trump in November or urged him to withdraw from the race and be replaced on the ballot .\nBut not only do three-quarters of Republican voters want the party to stand behind Trump , there \u2019 s a potential warning in the data for GOP officeholders like Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire , who announced Saturday she wouldn \u2019 t vote for him : Less than a third of voters are willing to give greater consideration to a candidate who un-endorses Trump .\nThe poll was conducted entirely on Saturday , the day after the Trump video was revealed by The Washington Post . Morning Consult surveyed 1,549 registered voters , with 1,390 likely voters . The margin of error for all results is plus or minus 2 percentage points , and 3 percentage points for likely voters .\nAsked at the outset about the 11-year-old video of Trump released Friday , 42 percent of voters said they had heard \u201c a lot \u201d about it . A further 37 percent said they had heard something about it , 13 percent said they hadn \u2019 t heard much , and 9 percent said they hadn \u2019 t heard about it at all .\nOn cable television , Trump \u2019 s comments have been covered far more extensively on CNN and MSNBC than they have on Fox News Channel , the preferred outlet for many conservative viewers . Partisan inclination is a key driver even among those with knowledge of Trump \u2019 s comments : More than half of Democrats , 55 percent , said they had heard \u201c a lot \u201d about the Trump video , but only a third of Republicans have heard a lot about it .\nTrump \u2019 s apology video \u2014 a 90-second video posted a few minutes after midnight on Saturday morning \u2014 failed to move the needle for most voters . On the same zero-to-10 scale , 47 percent gave Trump \u2019 s apology a negative rating , 14 percent gave it a neutral score and the remaining 39 percent gave it a positive rating . Twenty-six percent of voters scored it a zero ( very negative ) , and 13 percent scored it a 10 ( very positive ) .\nThe apology did help Trump somewhat with Republicans : 65 percent said they view him either very or somewhat more favorably after viewing it . But among all voters , only 37 percent viewed Trump more favorably .\nStill , even after viewing both videos as part of the poll \u2019 s administration , more voters said Trump shouldn \u2019 t drop out of the race , 45 percent , than say he should , 39 percent . More than three-quarters of Republicans , 78 percent , said Trump shouldn \u2019 t end his campaign . And more independents , 44 percent , said Trump should stay in the race , compared with only 35 percent who thought he should drop out .\nA number of high-profile , down-ballot Republican candidates distanced themselves from Trump on Saturday , but there \u2019 s little indication voters are preparing to punish continued support for Trump among other candidates . If a GOP candidate continued to support Trump , 39 percent of voters overall said it would make them somewhat or much less likely to vote for that candidate , compared with 23 percent who said it would make them more likely to vote for that candidate , and 31 percent who said it wouldn \u2019 t affect their vote .\nBut again , GOP voters reacted differently than voters overall . Some Republicans , like Ayotte and Sen . Rob Portman of Ohio , have for months balanced personal ambivalence toward Trump with efforts to avoid alienating pro-Trump voters in their battleground states . And even after watching the video , 41 percent of GOP voters said continued support for Trump would make them more likely to vote for the down-ballot candidate , while only 12 percent said it would make them less likely to vote for that candidate .\nIn fact , there \u2019 s evidence that cutting Trump loose could hurt Republicans like Ayotte , at least initially . There \u2019 s little to gain from bailing on Trump : While 31 percent of voters said renouncing support for Trump after the newly released video would make them more likely to vote for a Republican candidate , 25 percent said it would make them less likely to vote for that candidate . More than a third , 34 percent , said it doesn \u2019 t matter either way .\nAnd GOP voters could be prepared to punish Republicans who bail on Trump : 28 percent said it would make them more likely to vote for a candidate who can \u2019 t support Trump , but 25 percent said it would make them less likely to vote for that candidate . A 41-percent plurality said it won \u2019 t affect their vote .\nSome of the Republicans who have split from Trump have said they will write in the name of his running mate , Mike Pence , or called for the Republican National Committee to officially promote Pence to the top of the ticket . But there \u2019 s little evidence at the outset that such a move would help Republicans : Clinton holds a 6-point lead over Pence in a hypothetical matchup among likely voters , according to the poll .\nWhile Republican voters thus far are mostly shrugging off Trump \u2019 s comments , Sunday \u2019 s debate \u2014 and Trump \u2019 s reaction to questions about what he said and how he feels about and treats women \u2014 could reinforce this controversy .\nStill , the race on the eve of the debate remains both close and volatile . Clinton \u2019 s 4-point lead on the initial ballot test is slightly smaller than her 6-point edge on the four-way ballot in last week \u2019 s \u2588\u2588\u2588/Morning Consult poll . And , even a month before Election Day , 20 percent of likely voters won \u2019 t commit to Clinton or Trump on the initial ballot , either choosing a third-party candidate or saying they are undecided .\nMorning Consult is a nonpartisan media and technology company that provides data-driven research and insights on politics , policy and business strategy .\nMore details on the poll and its methodology can be found in these four documents \u2014 Toplines : http : //bit.ly/2dVJL2y Crosstabs : http : //bit.ly/2dK7p3v | Topical questions \u2014 Toplines : http : //bit.ly/2dTh7Q6 Crosstabs : http : //bit.ly/2dK8pVe",
