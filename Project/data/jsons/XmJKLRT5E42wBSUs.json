Lindsey Graham told CNN Sunday.The latest findings come from a declassified two-year investigation by the House Intelligence Committee , which looked at all sides of the incident , including claims that the White House cooked up phony talking points for then-UN Ambassador Susan Rice . `` I 'm saying the House Intelligence Committee is doing a lousy job policing their own , '' Graham told CNN correspondent Gloria Borger on the `` State of the Union '' program . `` I 'm saying that anybody who has followed Benghazi at all knows that the [ former ] CIA deputy director [ Mike Morell ] did not come forward to tell Congress what role he played in changing the talking points and the only way we knew he was involved is when he told a representative at the White House , I 'm going to do a hard review of this , a hard rewrite , '' said Graham.Further , he said , while Morell had initially said the FBI changed the talking points on what had been said about the attacks , a lawsuit later revealed that Morell was more involved than he had admitted . `` Who told [ National Security Advisor ] Susan Rice that the compound consulate was substantially strong and significantly secured ? '' Graham said . `` That was n't in the talking points , but she said that . `` Graham said there are still too many questions remaining about who was responsible for `` the version most politically beneficial to the administration , '' to accept the report that was released Friday.In a joint statement accompanying the release of the report , Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers , R-Mich. , and the committee 's top Democrat , Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger , Md. , said its probe was extensive.But Graham countered that the document is a `` bunch of garbage ... a complete bunch of garbage , '' with its claims , and that it 's a `` good question '' why Rogers , the Republican committee chair would believe statements to the contrary.Further , Graham pointed out reports of an email from earlier this year that showed White House White House Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes advising Rice to focus on a YouTube video as the cause of a spontaneous protest when she hit the talk show circuit the Sunday after the attacks . `` When Susan Rice was on television after the attack , she said on three different occasions the consulate was strongly , substantially and significantly secure , '' said Graham Sunday . `` She gave an impression to the American people that these folks were well taken care of when it was in fact a death trap . `` The report also said there is no evidence there was a stand-down order when it came to security for the Benghazi facility , an other point Graham denied Sunday . `` I can tell you that three contractors working for the agency said that they were told to wait for 20 minutes , '' said Graham . `` This report puts all the blame on the State Department and absolves the Intelligence Committee . When the Department of Defense Committee has looked at it , the Department of Defense was held blameless . `` And as a result , Graham said , `` everybody is pointing fingers to everybody else , '' but when the report that came out Friday said here was `` no manipulating of the American people , that is absolute garbage . `` And when the report said there is no evidence that CIA personnel misled Congress , Graham said , `` I do n't buy the idea that the agency did not mislead Congress because I was there when they misled me .
