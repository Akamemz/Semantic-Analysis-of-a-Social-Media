    "content": "The co-pilot of Germanwings Flight 4U 9525 appears to have deliberately crashed the plane carrying 150 people into the French Alps after the pilot had left the cockpit , Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said at a news conference Thursday .\n`` The interpretation ... that we can give at this time ... is that the co-pilot through voluntary abstention refused to open the door of the cockpit to the commander and activated the button that activates the loss of altitude , '' Robin said , providing often chilling details into the final moments before the airliner crashed .\nBut , he said : `` There 's nothing showing that this is a terrorist act . '' He also refused to characterize the actions as suicide .\nThe information was gleaned from the cockpit voice recorder , which was recovered from the crash site on Wednesday .\nRobin , a lead French investigator , described the conversation between the pilots at the initial part of the flight , after takeoff from Barcelona , Spain , on Tuesday as `` lively , pleasant , courteous , '' but he said that later , when the pilot was preparing the aircraft for landing in Duesseldorf , Germany , the co-pilot 's answers seemed `` short and curt . ''\nRobin identified the co-pilot as Andreas Lubitz , 27 , a German national . ( We earlier reported he was 28 . ) The Wall Street Journal reported that Lubitz lived in Montabaur , Germany . He had 630 hours of flying time and had joined Germanwings in September 2013 , directly after training .\nThe vastly more experienced pilot , whose name has not yet been released , had left the cockpit apparently to `` satisfy natural needs '' and handed the controls to the co-pilot , Robin said . Knocks , `` very violent knocks , '' on the cockpit door can be heard on the voice recorder as the pilot tried to regain access , Robin said . The co-pilot can be heard breathing until final impact , he said .\nThe Marseille prosecutor said the co-pilot did not respond to multiple attempts to get in touch by air traffic controllers in Marseille , and the co-pilot did not issue a mayday distress signal .\n`` He did n't say anything , '' Robin said . `` Not a single word . ''\nRobin said that screams from passengers can be heard moments before the final impact , but he noted : `` Death was sudden and immediate '' when the plane hit the mountain .\nGerman Transport Minister Alexander Dorbrindt , at a news conference in Germany , said the version put forward by Robin was `` plausible . ''\nAt a separate news conference , Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said : `` When a man is responsible for more than 150 lives , it 's more than suicide . ''\nSpohr said Lubitz had a `` long break '' during his training . He said he did not know why the break was taken , but that it was not unusual . Spohr said that upon Lubitz 's return , he was put through a series of tests to gauge his skills .\n`` There was never any doubt over his competence or skills , '' he said , adding Lubitz had gone through `` psychological tests with flying colors . ''\n`` It 's going to take a long time before we can unravel everything here , '' he said .\nThe U.S. State Department has identified the third American killed on the flight as Robert Oliver , but did not provide details .\n`` We are continuing to review our records to determine whether any other U.S. citizens might have been on board the flight , '' State Department spokesman Jeff Rathke said , according to Reuters .\nLufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had gone through `` psychological tests with flying colors . ''\nBut Lubitz went through an interruption in training , a `` long break , '' Spohr said .\nHe said he did not know the reason for the break , adding it could be medical , but privacy rules would bar him from knowing what those reasons were . And , he said , breaks in training are normal . When Lubitz returned , he said , he was put through a series of tests to gauge his skills .\n`` There was never any doubt over his competence or skills , '' he said .\nAnd , he added : `` It 's going to take a long time before we can unravel everything here . ''\nThe recovery of the bodies of the passengers is likely to continue until the end of next week , said Brice Robin , the Marseille prosecutor .\n`` There 's nothing showing that this is a terrorist act , '' said Brice Robin , the Marseille prosecutor .\nAnd , he said , he would not use the term `` suicide '' to describe the co-pilot 's apparent actions .\nMarseille prosecutor Brice Robin identified the co-pilot as Andreas Lubitz . He did not offer more details about Lubitz , except to say he was `` obviously capable of piloting the plane by himself . ''\nBut The Wall Street Journal said Lubitz , 28 , was from Montabaur , Germany .\nScreams can be heard before the final impact , Robin said , adding the passengers did not realize what was happening until the final moments .\nBut he noted : `` Death was sudden and immediate '' when the plane hit the mountain .\nThe actions of the co-pilot of Germanwings Flight 4U 9525 have been `` analyzed as willingness to destroy the aircraft , '' Brice Robin , the Marseille prosecutor , said at a news conference today .\n`` The interpretation ... that we can give at this time ... is that the co-pilot through voluntary abstention refused to open the door of the cockpit to the commander and activated the button that activates the loss of altitude , '' Robin said .\nThe co-pilot was breathing normally through the entire process . The pilot was locked out of the cockpit , Robin said . His comments were in French and translated into English on France 24 .\nBoth pilots are German nationals , he said . The co-pilot was not on any terrorist list , Robin said .\nThe focus of the investigation into what caused Germanwings Flight 4U 9525 to crash in the French Alps on Tuesday has shifted to the pilots .\nThe plane 's captain had more than 6,000 hours of flying time , Lufthansa , Germanwings ' parent company , said .
