Shanahan said this weekend that he will make the final call on $ 3.6 billion in military construction money that President Trump wants to build his border wall and quickly shot down the notion of raiding any funds meant to build or repair housing for troops and their families .\nThe Pentagon chief \u2014 who wouldn \u2019 t even commit to giving the White House all the money it wants under the president \u2019 s national emergency declaration \u2014 is pushing back as speculation swirls that key military projects at home and abroad could be on the chopping block .\nLawmakers in both parties spoke out forcefully Sunday to try to save projects that they say are now at risk , and the acting defense secretary seemed well-aware that he has been thrust into the middle of a politically charged battle that pits border security against military spending , two central priorities of the Republican Party .\n\u201c I think I have a lot of discretion , \u201d said Mr. Shanahan , who took over the job on Jan. 1 after a 30-year career at the defense contracting firm Boeing . \u201c I \u2019 m not required to do anything . \u201d\nUpgrades to a U.S. military hospital in Germany ; dock repairs at Pearl Harbor ; the operation of a middle school at Fort Campbell , Kentucky ; flight training projects at military facilities in Texas ; and maintenance at other bases across the country and across all branches of the armed forces could have funding slashed or eliminated entirely . Mr. Trump \u2019 s emergency declaration Friday gives him access to a pool of roughly $ 21 billion in unspent military construction funds to use for the wall .\nWhite House officials said they will try to pull about $ 3.6 billion out of that pot . The rest of the roughly $ 8 billion needed for the border barriers will come from money allocated last week under the bipartisan spending deal , military counternarcotics programs and a Treasury Department forfeiture program .\nBut Defense Department officials , along with lawmakers of both parties , are resisting the idea of siphoning military construction funds .\nMr. Shanahan would not commit to the $ 3.6 billion figure . He said he needs to sit down and review all projects on the table . The Pentagon was prepared for the emergency declaration , he said , and crafted a process to begin examining the construction budget .\n\u201c Very deliberately , we have not made any decisions . We \u2019 ve identified the steps we would take to make those decisions , \u201d Mr. Shanahan told reporters while traveling back to Washington from a NATO conference in Brussels . \u201c This is the important part of that . We laid that out so we could do it quickly . We don \u2019 t want to fumble through this process . \u201d\nMr. Shanahan already has ruled out at least one area of the military construction budget . Pressed by reporters on whether he could promise housing for troops would be protected , the acting secretary offered strong assurances .\n\u201c Will we take care of our men and women ? \u2018 Yes \u2019 is the answer , \u201d he said .\nOne area reportedly under consideration is a school at Fort Campbell . Lawmakers who back the president \u2019 s proposed wall and emergency declaration said upgrades and operational costs for the school ultimately will be funded but that the students would benefit equally from a stronger border .\n\u201c I would say it \u2019 s better for the middle school kids in Kentucky to have a secure border , \u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham , South Carolina Republican , told CBS \u2019 s \u201c Face the Nation \u201d on Sunday . \u201c We \u2019 ll get them the school they need .

The money has been designated for specific military projects , but no contracts have been signed and the construction or repairs have yet to begin .\nWhile Mr. Graham defended the president \u2019 s strategy , other Republicans argued that their party has spent the past two years fighting for more money for the military . Pulling money from the military budget , they said , would be a mistake and could hurt the readiness and training of American troops .\n\u201c How about the fact that in my district , in Del Rio , Texas , this produces more pilots than any other facility in the United States of America ? \u201d Rep.
