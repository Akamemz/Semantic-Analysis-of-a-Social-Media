Press reports , including one headlined \u201c Biden Inc. \u201d by Politico , have cited cases over the years of Mr. Biden \u2019 s brother James or son Hunter getting jobs or opportunities that appear to tap into their perceived clout as relatives of a powerful politician .

Still , many ethicists say such steps fall short of truly avoiding conflicts of interest , since Mr. Trump can \u2019 t \u201c unknow \u201d the properties he owns and upon which his future wealth depends .\nYet , even as Democrats decry Trump family behavior and Republicans call out the Bidens \u2019 \u201c corrupt family business practices , \u201d it \u2019 s not clear how much questions of financial impropriety will weigh on voters .\n\u201c The vulnerabilities are actually less than people are thinking \u201d for both political families , says Gregory Weiner , a political scientist at Assumption College in Massachusetts , and a scholar affiliated with the conservative American Enterprise Institute .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think what \u2019 s going on in the Trump family surprises anyone , and I think his outlandishness in everything he does provides him a form of protection , \u201d he says . \u201c I \u2019 m not saying it should , but I think it does . \u201d\nIf Joe Biden becomes the Democratic nominee , Dr. Weiner adds , Republicans are \u201c probably doing him a favor by getting this [ issue ] out of the way early . \u201d\nStill , he says politicians ultimately risk ballot-box accountability if their actions become overly troublesome to voters .\nAnd experts say public officials \u2019 financial ethics are deeply important to the health of a democratic republic like the U.S .\nIt \u2019 s probably not realistic to expect politicians to police all the professional activities of adult family members \u2013 other than to make plain that no political favors will be granted , says Richard Painter , a former ethics official in the White House of George W.
