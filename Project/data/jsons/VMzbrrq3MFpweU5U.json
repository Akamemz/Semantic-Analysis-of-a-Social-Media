She said the process of investigating what was potentially classified would be playing out the same way had she used an official government account .\n\u201c This is part of the ordinary process , \u201d Mrs. Clinton said . \u201c Everybody is acting like it \u2019 s the first time it \u2019 s ever happened . It happens all the time . \u201d\nWhen pressed as to whether she took responsibility for the controversy her private email use has prompted , Mrs. Clinton said , \u201c I regret this has become such a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre , but that does not change the facts . \u201d\n\u201c I know there \u2019 s a certain level of sort of anxiety or interest in this , but the facts are the facts , \u201d she said .\nMrs. Clinton has fielded questions about the email controversy at almost every stop on the campaign since she announced her candidacy for the presidency in April , but the exchange on Tuesday was particularly tense .\nAt one point Mr. Henry asked Mrs. Clinton about an NBC News report that the Federal Bureau of Investigation may be able to recover some of the messages on the server and whether she had tried to wipe the server clean before handing it over to the F.B.I . That exchange follows :\nMr. Henry : Did you try to wipe the entire server ?\nMrs. Clinton : My personal emails are my personal business , right ? We went through a painstaking process and turned over 55,000 pages of anything we thought could be work-related . Under the law , that decision is made by the official . I was the official . I made those decisions , and as I just said over 1,200 of the emails have already been deemed not work-related . All I can tell you is in retrospect had I used a government account and I \u2019 d said : \u201c You know what , let \u2019 s release everything . Let \u2019 s let everybody in America see what I did for four years , \u201d we would have the same arguments .\nMr. Henry : Answer the question . Did you try to wipe the whole server ? You didn \u2019 t answer the question .\nMrs. Clinton : I don \u2019 t . I have no idea , that \u2019 s why I turned it over .\nMr. Henry : You were the official in charge of it . Did you wipe the server ?\nMr. Henry : I don \u2019 t know . You know how it works digitally .\nMrs. Clinton : I don \u2019 t know how it works digitally at all .\nMr. Henry : So you didn \u2019 t try ? You did not try ?\nMrs. Clinton : Ed , I know you want to make a point and I can just repeat what I said .\nMrs. Clinton : In order to be as cooperative as possible we have turned over the server . They can do whatever they want to with the server to figure out what is there and not there . That \u2019 s for the people investigating it to figure out .
