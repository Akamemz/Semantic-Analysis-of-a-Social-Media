If properly decided , the cases will nudge Congress to act like a legislative body .\nAt issue is whether workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation is forbidden by the 1964 Civil Rights Act , which proscribed discrimination because of a person \u2019 s \u201c race , color , religion , sex , or national origin. \u201d The question is whether \u201c sex \u201d also proscribes discrimination based on sexual orientation .
