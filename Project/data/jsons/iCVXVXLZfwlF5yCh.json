Yesterday was May Day , traditionally celebrated as a rite of passage from winter to the growing season , but it \u2019 s also taken on a decidedly anti-capitalist tone over the decades .

There were the usual attacks on the police , with rocks and fire bombs being tossed . Fortunately , the five officers who were injured in the line of duty all seem to have relatively minor injuries which were not life threatening .
