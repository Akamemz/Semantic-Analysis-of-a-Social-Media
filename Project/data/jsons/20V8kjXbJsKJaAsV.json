But the weaker contenders will also come under considerable pressure . Some will likely begin running out of money or will fail to qualify for the next set of debates , culling the now-sprawling field .\nIt was at the Iowa State Fair in 2011 that Mitt Romney perilously told a heckler : \u201c Corporations are people. \u201d Republicans Tommy Thompson and Tim Pawlenty abandoned their presidential campaigns that year after a weak showing in the Ames Straw Poll , before the GOP discontinued the tradition .\nFour years later in New Hampshire , Hillary Clinton welcomed summer with her moving rope line to keep reporters at bay , reinforcing her campaign \u2019 s imperious image .\n\u201c The political landscape in Iowa is full of corn , soybeans and landmines , \u201d said Dave Nagle , a former Iowa congressman and state Democratic party chairman . \u201c An offhanded comment when a candidate is tired , a flippant remark can be blown way out of proportion and put a candidate significantly behind . \u201d\nOr as the progressive consultant Rebecca Katz put it , \u201c There \u2019 s plenty of chances to fuck this all up . \u201d\n\u201c All of these moments with candidates have been pretty controlled \u201d so far in the campaign , said Katz , who advised Cynthia Nixon in her primary campaign against New York Gov . Andrew Cuomo last year . \u201c But now we \u2019 re getting into the quote , unquote fun part , and you \u2019 re going to see them out there with people really talking , and who knows what will happen . \u201d\nThe campaign \u2019 s summer push began in 108-degree heat over the weekend in Las Vegas , where 19 candidates were drawn to a labor forum , then held competing rallies and events at senior centers , restaurants and churches in the city and suburban Henderson .\nThe herd will migrate this week to Iowa and its Wing Ding dinner and state fair \u2014 speaking to raucous crowds and meeting with supporters , but also contending with fried food and hecklers .\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden \u2019 s campaign will focus much of its effort over the next six weeks building its organization in the four early primary states , with the candidate planning a spate of public appearances . Such in-person visits are vital to locking in support reflected in current polls , while also allowing Biden to road test and fine tune his campaign messages before public attention turns more completely to 2020 after Labor Day , a Biden adviser told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nSen. Kamala Harris , who has been slower than some candidates to establish a presence in Iowa , is planning a five-day bus tour through the state to assert herself there . Sens . Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are both planning to aggressively campaign in Iowa and other early primary states . Several campaigns are beginning to internally discuss television advertising , after President Donald Trump aired a 30-second ad during the Democratic debates last week criticizing Democrats for \u201c proposing a free taxpayer-funded healthcare for illegal immigrants . \u201d\n\u201c Somehow these debates sort of stultified the race in some ways , \u201d said Paul Maslin , a top Democratic pollster . \u201c We \u2019 re in the middle of summer , and starting to get into late summer , and I don \u2019 t think any major candidate \u2026 has start to spend serious money in Iowa yet , or South Carolina or New Hampshire for that matter . \u201d\nHe said , \u201c I think these debates were a weird kind of death trap for most of these [ campaigns ] \u2026 I think now it \u2019 s going to start becoming much more of a fight about Iowa and New Hampshire . \u201d\nInitial polling following the second round of debates suggested little movement in public opinion polls . And most observers \u2014 including advisers to several campaigns \u2014 do not expect significant swings in public opinion before the next debates .\nIt is not impossible , however , and candidates will try . Twenty years ago , Bill Bradley used a furious summer of campaigning in New Hampshire to pull even with or overtake Al Gore in state polls , putting a scare into Gore \u2019 s campaign . Mark Longabaugh , who ran Bradley \u2019 s campaign in the state , called August \u201c a dynamite time to gain ground in Iowa and New Hampshire \u2026 It \u2019 s a good opportunity to connect to some of those voters . \u201d\nIn 2007 , then-Sen. Barack Obama used the summer of the off-election year to add policy heft to his campaign , proposing tax cuts for the middle class and announcing a plan to withdraw troops from Iraq .
