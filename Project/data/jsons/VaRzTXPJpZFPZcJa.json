Bush .\n\u201c I have no time for people who are partisan for the sake of being partisan , \u201d Ms. Clinton , a Democrat and former secretary of state , told a crowd that welcomed her enthusiastically in a historic building at Snug Harbor Cultural Center .\nMs. Clinton was the second leading presidential candidate to speak on Staten Island today , after Republican Donald Trump delivered a typical stump speech at a Republican brunch . But Ms. Clinton , perhaps sensing or recalling Staten Island \u2019 s ever-present desire for politicians to pay attention to the forgotten borough , delivered a speech that seemed to be especially tailored for the borough , which is more conservative than the rest of New York City . The majority of its voters are registered Democrats , but the borough routinely swings Republican .\n\u201c When I ran in 2000 , I didn \u2019 t carry Staten Island . When I ran in 2006 , I did , \u201d Ms. Clinton said today . \u201c I \u2019 ve got no problem with people having political disagreements . That \u2019 s in America \u2019 s DNA , isn \u2019 t it ? \u201d\nInstead , Ms. Clinton decried \u201c deliberate efforts to set Americans against each other. \u201d She harkened back to representing the borough of cops and firefighters on September 11 , 20001 , when nearly 300 Staten Islanders were killed in the terror attacks . She noted the city \u2019 s mayor , the state \u2019 s governor , and the president were all Republicans .\n\u201c I did not for one minute stop and say to myself : \u2018 Well , I don \u2019 t know , can we work together ? ' \u201d Ms. Clinton said . \u201c How absurd is that ? \u201d\nMs. Clinton said with 3,000 people murdered , people \u201c pulled together \u201d and \u201c politics was totally left behind. \u201d She had criticized President Bush for his handling of a strong economy he \u201c inherited \u201d from her husband , President Bill Clinton , and for other reasons . But she praised him for approving billions of dollars to rebuild lower Manhattan after the terror attacks , even as others in Washington didn \u2019 t want to spend it .\n\u201c I publicly say , \u2018 Thank you President George W. Bush , \u2019 for making sure that we got the money that we needed to rebuild our city , \u201d Ms. Clinton said .\nShe also touted her record working for the borough after the attacks , including sounding the alarm on air quality and pushing for the passage of the Zadroga Act . Ms. Clinton went on to discuss her foreign policy experience , saying anyone who wants to president has to be able to offer specifics on what they would do\u2014an allusion to her Democratic rival Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2014but also has to be able to keep people safe .\n\u201c Maybe we take that more seriously here in New York , but we should , \u201d she said . \u201c And we are going to do everything we can to keep America safe . \u201d\nShe cited her work building a coalition that \u201c brought Iran to the negotiating table , \u201d without mentioning how controversial that final Iran deal was for President Barack Obama .\nMs. Clinton \u2019 s rally had little in common with Mr. Trump \u2019 s Staten Island event , except one thing : the crowd at both seemed to hate Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz . Ms. Clinton mentioned his plan to spy on Muslim neighborhoods , which has also been dismissed by Police Commissioner Bill Bratton .\nAt the mention of Mr. Cruz \u2019 s name , the crowd offered a chorus of boos .\n\u201c Exactly , \u201d Ms. Clinton said knowingly . \u201c The perfect Staten Island response . \u201d\nThe crowd had been hyped up for Ms. Clinton before she even arrived , and gave a nice response to several local pols as they urged people to get out the vote on Tuesday .\n\u201c Hillary is the only one with the experience , \u201d said Councilwoman Debi Rose , a Democrat who represents the borough \u2019 s North Shore . \u201c She knows what it \u2019 s like to be in the White House .
