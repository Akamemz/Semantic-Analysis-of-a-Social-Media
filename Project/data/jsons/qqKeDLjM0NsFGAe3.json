Darr Beiser, USA TODAY)\n\nTed Cruz isn't shy.\n\nHe's combative. He rejects compromise as \"the mushy middle.\" He's not inclined to wait his turn. And he doesn't seem to mind annoying his Republican elders with tactics that critics see as destructive and short-sighted.\n\nSo perhaps it's no surprise that little more than two years after he was sworn in to the Senate, the 44-year-old Texan on Monday became the first contender to officially announce his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. He skipped the one-step-at-a-time tradition of announcing an \"exploratory\" committee to declare flatly that he was in the race.\n\n\"It's going to take a new generation of courageous conservatives to help make America great again,\" Cruz said in a 30-second video he posted on Twitter early Monday morning, followed by a speech at Liberty University, \"and I'm ready to stand with you to lead the fight.\"\n\nHe won't be lonely for long.

In the Senate, he has been more of an agitator than a legislator. Arizona Sen. John McCain, the GOP's 2008 nominee, once called him a \"wacko bird.\"\n\nThat said, Cruz is worth watching.\n\nFor one thing, the skills he honed as a college debater at Princeton \u2014 he was named U.S. National Speaker of the Year in 1992 \u2014 should serve him well in the series of crowded primary debates.\n\nFor another, while his Tea Party credentials might be a mixed blessing in a general election, in the primaries they align him with the most energized forces in the Republican grass roots today.
