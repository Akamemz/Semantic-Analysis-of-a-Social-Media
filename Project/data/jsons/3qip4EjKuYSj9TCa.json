Anthony Weiner , who is married to top Clinton aide Huma Abedin and is under investigation for allegedly exchanging lewd text messages with a 15-year-old girl .\nClinton herself projected confidence during a brief news conference in Iowa , urging Comey to release the \u201c full and complete facts \u201d about its review and brushing off any potential political fallout .\n`` I think people a long time ago made up their minds about the emails , '' she said . `` I think that 's factored into what people think and now they 're choosing a president . ''\nAs for any connection between the emails and Abedin and Weiner , who announced their separation in August , Clinton called the reports \u201c rumors \u201d and said , \u201c We do n't know what to believe . \u201d\nClinton has painted Trump as an erratic bully whose attacks are generally grounded more in projection than fact . But the revelation seemed to give credence to at least one of Trump \u2019 s charges on Clinton \u2019 s staff . \u201c I only worry for the country in that Hillary Clinton was careless and negligent in allowing Weiner to have such close proximity to highly classified information , \u201d Trump said last August , after Abedin dumped Weiner .\nThe Comey announcement is expected to allow Trump to revisit questions of Clinton \u2019 s judgment , which have also emerged in the hacked personal emails of campaign chairman John Podesta .
