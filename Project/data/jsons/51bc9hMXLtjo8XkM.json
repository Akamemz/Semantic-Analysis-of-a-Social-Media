    "content": "In response to recent mass shootings , supporters of stricter gun laws have voiced a simple mantra : \u201c Do something ! \u201d\nOn Wednesday , Democratic presidential candidates will attend a six-hour forum hosted by MSNBC and gun advocacy groups Giffords and March for Our Lives to explain what they would do .\nPresident Donald Trump , for his part , doesn \u2019 t seem interested in much . He has supported a federal red flag law , which would allow police to take away someone \u2019 s guns if there \u2019 s some proof of a risk of violence ( a \u201c red flag \u201d ) . But on other measures , from universal background checks to an assault weapons ban , Trump and Republican lawmakers have resisted , instead talking up questionable connections between violence , mental illness , and violent media .\nDemocratic candidates , however , have taken more comprehensive stances on guns . For the most part , they \u2019 re sticking to common Democratic themes like universal background checks , an assault weapons ban ( which is typically paired with a ban on high-capacity magazines ) , and federally funded research into gun violence . But the campaigns \u2019 plans do include some new ideas here and there \u2014 including red flag laws , which campaigns ranging from Cory Booker \u2019 s to John Delaney \u2019 s back , and requiring a license to buy and own a gun , which Booker in particular brought to the presidential stage but others , like Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg , also support .\nAs I \u2019 ve argued before , even the most ambitious of the candidates \u2019 gun control proposals don \u2019 t go far enough to seriously dent gun violence . America leads the developed world in gun violence , with gun death rates nearly four times that of Switzerland , five times that of Canada , 35 times that of the United Kingdom , and 53 times that of Japan . The core problem is the US simply has way too many guns and too much access to firearms , letting just about anyone obtain a weapon to carry out a mass shooting or more typical types of gun violence , whether suicides or homicides .\nBut none of the Democratic proposals do anything to swiftly address that core problem and significantly reduce the number of guns in the US .\nStill , the research suggests that stricter gun laws , particularly licensing , would reduce gun deaths . So the Democratic proposals would make some progress , even if they wouldn \u2019 t be enough to bring down America \u2019 s rate of gun deaths to that of its developed peers .\nMost Democratic candidates at least mention gun violence on their campaign websites and other networks ( like Medium ) . But a few , including Booker , Warren , and Joe Biden , go into a lot of detail .\nThe Democratic candidates are in general agreement on at least two proposals : universal background checks and an assault weapons ban . When it comes to other issues , there \u2019 s a bit less agreement , or at least less attention .\nThe big common proposal is universal background checks . Under federal law , licensed gun dealers have to run a background check , looking at factors like criminal record and mental health history , to sell someone a firearm . But unlicensed sellers \u2014 think a family member , or perhaps someone over the internet or at a gun show \u2014 don \u2019 t have to run a check . Universal background checks attempt to stamp out the unlicensed sellers by requiring a background check for all or nearly all gun transactions .\nAn assault weapons ban has also received more attention with the rise of extremely deadly mass shootings , as the shooters have used weapons like AR-15s and WASR-10s ( a variant of an AK-47 ) to carry out the attacks . There are questions about how it would be implemented and enforced , but the idea is to ban military-style semiautomatic rifles . Some Democratic candidates frame this as bringing back a previous federal assault weapons ban , which was enacted in 1994 but expired in 2004 , that kept existing weapons in circulation but tried to restrict future sales . Others want to go further , requiring that gun owners actually turn in the banned weapons through a mandatory buyback program .\nBeyond those two proposals , candidates have also supported red flag laws , which could allow a family member , neighbor , close friend , teacher , or cop to report an \u201c extreme risk \u201d of violence to the courts . The court could then order the seizure of a person \u2019 s weapons .\nThe candidates also favor closing loopholes in existing gun laws . That includes the \u201c boyfriend loophole , \u201d which lets people get a gun even if they have a protective order against them due to a dating relationship , and the \u201c Charleston loophole , \u201d which allows a small number of people to obtain a gun without completing a background check if the check takes too long . ( This is how the self-described white supremacist who killed nine people at a predominantly black church in Charleston , South Carolina , in 2015 got his gun . )\nThere \u2019 s also a lot of support for federally funded research into gun violence , as well as the repeal of special legal protections for gun companies .\nSome candidates have moved to the left by calling for gun licensing , which would require a license to purchase and own a firearm . Typically , obtaining a license would involve a background check , but also a more extensive vetting process that can require submitting fingerprints and a photo , interviews with law enforcement , and a gun safety training course . Some would pair this proposal \u2014 as is done in , for example , Massachusetts \u2014 with mandatory registration of firearms . ( This , in theory , allows police to pull up a database of weapons to seize if someone loses a license . )\nSeveral candidates , including Booker , Warren , Buttigieg , and Andrew Yang , support a federal system that would require all gun owners get a license to buy and own firearms . Others , including Biden and Michael Bennet , have been more cautious , and even critical , toward the idea .\nOtherwise , there \u2019 s been little significant movement from the typical Democratic mantras of universal background checks and an assault weapons ban .\nThe Democratic proposals on guns show how stuck the debate over this issue has been for decades . In 1993 and 1994 , a Democratic-controlled Congress passed federal background checks and a 10-year assault weapons ban . In the 25 years since , the debate has largely been relegated to \u2026 more background checks and an assault weapons ban . As the party has moved left on everything from single-payer health care to the Green New Deal to taxes on the wealthy , it hasn \u2019 t really moved on guns .\nOne reason is that Democrats \u2019 philosophy on gun policy has remained largely the same : to prevent certain kinds of people from getting guns , and at most prohibit only a small fraction of firearms .\nBut America \u2019 s problem is much broader : It simply has too many guns , regardless of whether they \u2019 re in a \u201c good \u201d guy \u2019 s hands or a \u201c bad \u201d guy \u2019 s hands . The US has far more guns than any other country in the world \u2014 more guns than people , according to the Small Arms Survey . That makes it easy to get a firearm , legally or not , leading to more gun deaths .\nResearch compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health \u2019 s Injury Control Research Center backs this up : After controlling for variables such as socioeconomic factors and other crime , places with more guns have more gun deaths \u2014 not just homicides but also suicides , domestic violence , violence against police , and mass shootings .\nAnother way to look at this : Everywhere in the world , people get into arguments . Every country has residents who are dangerous to themselves or others because of mental illness . Every country has bigots and extremists . But in America , it \u2019 s uniquely easy for a person to obtain a gun , letting otherwise tense but nonlethal conflicts escalate into deadly violence .\nYes , stronger gun laws can help . A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries , published in Epidemiologic Reviews , found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence \u2014 a strong indicator that restricting access to guns can save lives .\nBut the types of gun control laws matter . Some of the recent research on universal background checks has been mixed , and studies on the last assault weapons ban found it ineffective for reducing overall levels of gun violence , in part because the great majority of gun deaths involves handguns , not assault weapons . But studies on licensing have been very consistent in significantly reducing gun deaths \u2014 in urban counties , Connecticut , and Missouri , including for suicides .\nOne reason licensing might work is that it addresses America \u2019 s core gun problem . On its face , licensing might seem like an extension of the background check model , since the idea is still to filter between qualified and unqualified people .\nBut a licensing process can go way further : While a background check is more often than not quick and hassle-free , gun licensing in , for example , Massachusetts is a weeks- or months-long process that requires submitting a photograph and fingerprints , passing a training course , and going through one or more interviews , all involving law enforcement . That adds significant barriers for even a would-be gun owner who has no ill intent or bad history .\n\u201c The end impact is you decrease gun ownership overall , \u201d Cassandra Crifasi , a researcher ( and gun owner ) at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research , previously told me , discussing Massachusetts \u2019 s laws . \u201c Lots of folks think , \u2018 Well , it \u2019 s probably not worth going through all these hoops to buy firearms , so I \u2019 m not going to buy one. \u2019 And then you have fewer firearms around , and less exposure . \u201d\nThis , however , could only be a start : the kind of thing that ensures fewer people get guns now and in the future . But in a country that already has so many firearms , something also needs to be done to take out a lot of guns more quickly .\nThat could require rethinking the Second Amendment , possibly by appointing judges who interpret it differently \u2014 an inversion of the NRA \u2019 s campaign to portray gun ownership as an individual right . It might even mean beginning an effort to repeal the amendment , a project that could admittedly take decades but has gotten less serious consideration and support than packing the Supreme Court or even abolishing the Senate .\nSignificant change could involve imposing bigger hurdles to owning a gun \u2014 requiring that people provide a stronger justification , besides self-defense or recreation , to obtain a license .\nIt could mean banning more types of guns \u2014 perhaps all semiautomatic weapons or all handguns \u2014 and coupling that with an Australian-style mandatory buyback program , which the research supports . If the key difference between America and other countries is how many more guns the US has , then something has to be done to quickly reduce the number of firearms here .\nDemocrats aren \u2019 t there yet . Until that changes , there will be little voice in the presidential stage to the kinds of policies that could get American gun violence down to the levels of the US \u2019 s developed peers .\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden : Biden \u2019 s campaign website includes a plan to combat gun violence . He calls for universal background checks , an assault weapons ban , closing loopholes in existing laws , better enforcement of existing laws , red flag laws , federally funded gun violence research , investing money into urban violence programs , and a public push for \u201c smart guns. \u201d On licensing , he only calls for financial incentives for states to adopt the policy , letting states decline and differing from candidates who want a federal licensing system . Previously , Biden also claimed \u201c gun licensing will not change whether or not people buy what weapons \u2014 what kinds of weapons they can buy , where they can use them , how they can store them . \u201d\nSen. Elizabeth Warren : Warren \u2019 s campaign website includes a plan to fight gun violence . The plan aims to reduce gun deaths by 80 percent . Warren calls for executive actions to expand background checks , close loopholes in existing laws , and target gun traffickers and licensed gun dealers who break the law . She also proposes sweeping legislation that includes universal background checks and an assault weapons ban but also gun licensing as well as support for urban gun violence intervention programs . And with federally funded gun violence research , she promises to return to the issue of firearms annually , \u201c adding new ideas and tweaking existing ones based on new data \u2014 to continually reduce the number of gun deaths in America . \u201d\nSen. Bernie Sanders : Sanders \u2019 s campaign website includes a gun safety platform , and he released a separate plan to combat white supremacist extremism . He promises to make background checks universal , ban assault weapons , and crack down on \u201c straw purchases \u201d of firearms . On licensing , his campaign also told the Trace that he \u201c supports the right of states , localities and tribal governments to implement licensing programs. \u201d Sanders has historically taken more moderate stances on gun control , but he \u2019 s shifted to the left in recent years ; for example , he originally voted for special legal protections for gun companies in 2003 and 2005 , but has since come out against them .\nSouth Bend , Indiana , Mayor Pete Buttigieg : Buttigieg \u2019 s campaign website includes a section on gun laws , and he also released a separate plan to \u201c combat the national threat posed by hate and the gun lobby. \u201d In the plans , Buttigieg says he supports universal background checks , an assault weapons ban , gun licensing , closing the \u201c Charleston loophole , \u201d closing loopholes in gun laws related to domestic violence and hate crimes , red flag laws , federally funded research on gun violence , and investing money into urban gun violence intervention programs .\nSen. Kamala Harris : Harris \u2019 s campaign website promises \u201c action on gun violence. \u201d As president , she plans to give Congress 100 days to pass stronger gun laws , including universal background checks , an assault weapons ban , and the repeal of special legal protections for gun companies . But if Congress doesn \u2019 t act , she promises to sign executive orders to expand background checks , crack down on bad gun companies and dealers , make it more difficult for some people with criminal records ( including domestic violence ) to buy firearms , and ban the importation of some assault weapons into the US . She also said , on gun licensing , \u201c I like the idea . \u201d\nAndrew Yang : Yang \u2019 s campaign website includes a gun safety plan . He supports universal background checks , an assault weapons ban , gun licensing , closing loopholes in existing laws , repealing special legal protections for gun companies , federally funded research on gun violence , and creating financial incentives for firearm owners to obtain smart guns .\nFormer Rep. Beto O \u2019 Rourke : O \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s campaign website includes a section and plan on gun violence . He supports universal background checks , an assault weapons ban , gun licensing , red flag laws , a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons , closing loopholes in gun laws like the \u201c Charleston loophole \u201d and those linked to domestic violence , and funding for trauma support and community programs related to firearm education and disrupting gun violence . He also vows to take executive actions that would try to strengthen enforcement of existing laws .\nSen. Cory Booker : Booker \u2019 s campaign website includes two proposals to combat gun violence and gun suicides . He emphasizes gun licensing and registration as his main proposal , but his plans also include the typical mainstays of Democratic gun policy : universal background checks , an assault weapons ban , closing loopholes in existing laws and regulations , red flag laws , safe storage requirements , and more funding for gun violence research . He also vows to take executive action to tighten gun laws as much as possible if Congress doesn \u2019 t act . And he backs a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons .\nFormer HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro : Castro \u2019 s campaign website includes a section on \u201c disarming hate. \u201d He supports universal background checks , an assault weapons ban , gun licensing , closing loopholes in gun laws , and red flag laws .\nRep. Tulsi Gabbard : Gabbard \u2019 s campaign website includes a section on gun safety legislation . She supports universal background checks , closing loopholes in laws regarding domestic violence and suspected terrorism , and an assault weapons ban .\nSen. Amy Klobuchar : Klobuchar \u2019 s campaign released a plan on gun violence . She backs universal background checks , an assault weapons ban , closing loopholes in existing laws , repealing special legal protections for gun companies , and federally funded research on gun violence .\nSen. Michael Bennet : Bennet \u2019 s campaign website does not include a gun policy platform , and his campaign did not return requests for comment . He told the Trace he supports universal background checks , an assault weapons ban , red flag laws , repealing special legal protections for gun companies , and federally funded research on gun violence . But he opposes gun licensing .\nTom Steyer : Steyer \u2019 s campaign website does not include a gun policy platform , and his campaign did not return requests for comment .\nMarianne Williamson : Williamson \u2019 s campaign website includes a section on gun policy . She supports universal background checks , an assault weapons ban , gun licensing , mandatory waiting periods , stricter laws regarding children \u2019 s use of guns , child safety locks for all guns , red flag laws , and federally funded research into gun violence .\nMontana Gov . Steve Bullock : Bullock \u2019 s campaign website does not include a gun policy platform , and his campaign did not return requests for comment . He has voiced support for universal background checks , an assault weapons ban , and red flag laws .\nRep. Tim Ryan : Ryan \u2019 s campaign website does not include a gun policy platform , and his campaign did not return requests for comment . He has voiced support for universal background checks and an assault weapons ban .\nFormer Rep. John Delaney : Delaney \u2019 s campaign website includes a gun safety platform . He supports universal background checks , an assault weapons ban , closing loopholes in existing laws , red flag laws , and federally funded research on gun violence .\nFormer Rep. Joe Sestak : Sestak \u2019 s website includes a section on violence prevention .
