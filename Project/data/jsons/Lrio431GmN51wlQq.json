Calls for swift and certain justice . including death penalty . \u201d\nDemocratic candidates were unsparing in assessing blame , with former Rep. Beto O \u2019 Rourke of Texas leading the way . He said on Sunday that responsibility for the shooting in his hometown of El Paso the day before \u2014 one of two in 24 hours that left at least 29 dead \u2014 fell on President Donald Trump and his racial rhetoric , accusing the president of \u201c encouraging \u201d such acts of violence .\nIn addition to shoring up gun control laws , O \u2019 Rourke said in an interview on CNN \u2019 s \u201c State of the Union , \u201d \u201c we have to acknowledge the hatred , the open racism that we \u2019 re seeing , \u201d adding that \u201c there is an environment of it in the United States . \u201d\nNearly half a dozen other presidential contenders \u2014 including Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio , Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey , Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend , Ind. , and Juli\u00e1n Castro , the only Hispanic candidate in the 2020 Democratic field \u2014 also placed blame on Trump for his rhetoric .\n\u201c He is ripping at our nation , \u201d Booker said on CNN , repeatedly using the word \u201c failing \u201d and saying the president \u201c must be held responsible . \u201d\nCastro added that \u201c I believe that President Trump is making it worse , \u201d and Buttigieg said the president was \u201c condoning and encouraging white nationalism . \u201d\nThose attacks on the president suggested a gloves-off approach in responding to a string of horrific mass shootings in Texas , Ohio and California during a summer in which political rhetoric has repeatedly and insistently dropped into the gutter .\nOn Saturday afternoon , a gunman opened fire outside of a WalMart in a busy shopping center in El Paso , which sits just across the border from Mexico and has a large Latino population . Police say that the attack killed at least 20 and wounded two dozen others . The suspect , identified as 21-year-old Patrick Crusius , is in custody . Authorities are working to see whether Crusius is the author of a racist , anti-immigrant manifesto posted online shortly before the attack , and whether hate crime charges should be filed .\nHours later , a mass shooting in Dayton , Ohio , left nine dead and injured dozens . Police have identified that shooter , who was killed by responding officers , as 24-year-old Connor Betts . Authorities have not determined a motive for that attack . The killings Saturday and Sunday came less than a week after three were killed and a dozen others wounded when a gunman opened fire at a garlic festival in Gilroy , Calif .\nThough Trump tweeted throughout the weekend , he was out of sight and at his golf club in Bedminster , N.J. , during the two back-to-back mass shootings . On Sundays afternoon , before heading back to the White House , he denounced both attacks , telling reporters that \u201c hate has no place in our country \u201d and vowing to \u201c take care of it . \u201d\nHe offered his condolences to members of both communities and said he \u2019 d been in touch with lawmakers from both states , as well as spoken with Attorney General William Barr \u201c at length \u201d and FBI Director Christopher Wray .\nTrump also praised law enforcement , telling reporters in New Jersey that \u201c nobody could have done what they 've done . This could have been \u2014 as bad as it was , it could have been so much worse . I just have to thank them . \u201d\nThe president made no mention of white supremacism on Sunday and focused instead on mental illness . He also did n't say anything about the critics laying blame at his feet , but appeared to allude to it by noting that \u201c this has been going on for years . For years and years in our country . \u201d\nHe demurred when asked what his administration planned to do about the shootings . He said he would be making a statement on Monday morning , though Trump has always struggled with the role of a president who consoles the nation during tragedies like these .\nLaw enforcement officials block a road at the scene of a mass shooting at a shopping complex on Aug. 4 , 2019 , in El Paso , Texas . | John Locher/AP Photo\n\u201c We 're talking to a lot of people and a lot of things are in the works , and a lot of good things , \u201d he said .\nThe president earlier on Sunday had called both weekend shootings \u201c senseless attacks \u201d and ordered flags to be flown at half-staff through Thursday .\n\u201c We condemn these hateful and cowardly acts , \u201d he said in a proclamation . \u201c Through our grief , America stands united with the people of El Paso and Dayton . May God be with the victims of these two horrific crimes and bring aid and comfort to their families and friends . \u201d\nThe weekend \u2019 s rampages are not the first time Trump \u2019 s rhetoric has been tied to violence as a possible motivating factor or a catalyst for attacks . But they come as Trump continues to lean on racist tropes as he runs for reelection .\nO \u2019 Rourke , who left the presidential campaign trail to return home in the wake of the El Paso shooting , repeatedly accused Trump of using language more commonly found during Hitler \u2019 s Third Reich , but also said that the president \u2019 s rhetoric was commonly found on the internet and even Fox News .\n\u201c He is encouraging this , \u201d O \u2019 Rourke told host Jake Tapper of CNN . \u201c He doesn \u2019 t just tolerate it ; he encourages it , calling immigrants rapists and criminals and seeking to ban all people of one religion . \u201d\n\u201c Folks are responding to this . It does n't just offend us , it encourages the violence we 're seeing including in my hometown of El Paso yesterday . \u201d\nCastro , another presidential candidate from Texas , echoed some of O \u2019 Rourke \u2018 s statements . He said that while the shooter was \u201c responsible directly for that shooting in El Paso , \u201d the president had created an environment that made the shooting possible .\n\u201c Anybody who has the ability to see and hear and understand what the president has been doing since he started his campaign in 2015 knows that division and bigotry and fanning the flames of hate has been his political strategy , \u201d he said on ABC \u2019 s \u201c This Week . \u201d\nCastro added : \u201c He \u2019 s given license for this toxic brew of white supremacy to fester more and more in this country . And we \u2019 re seeing the results of that . \u201d\nHe also said he was convinced that it was indeed a hate crime . \u201c You can see Mexico \u2014 literally see Mexico from the parking lot of this WalMart , \u201d he told host Jonathan Karl . \u201c So this shooter must have known what he was doing . \u201d\nBooker said Trump was \u201c savagely fraying the bonds of our nation , \u201d in an extended attack on what he said were the president \u2019 s moral failings .\n\u201c Our president right now is using the same language of racism , bigotry and white supremacy , \u201d Booker said , adding : \u201c He himself is using the language of hate . \u201d\nSpeaking on NBC \u2019 s \u201c Meet the Press , \u201d Booker told host Chuck Todd : \u201c To say nothing in a time of rising hatred , it \u2019 s not enough to say , \u2018 I \u2019 m not a hate monger myself. \u2019 If you are not actively working against hate , calling it out , you are complicit in what is going on . \u201d\nO \u2019 Rourke outlined a litany of instances by the president in which he has derided minorities or immigrants , including Trump \u2019 s call to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. during the 2016 presidential campaign , his assertion that there were \u201c very fine people \u201d on both sides of a 2017 neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville , Va. , that turned violent , and Trump \u2019 s more recent attacks on lawmakers of color .\n\u201c These are white men motivated by the kind of fear that this president traffics in , \u201d O \u2019 Rourke argued in referring to a spate of domestic terrorism episodes targeting minorities .\nAsked whether O \u2019 Rourke agreed with a fellow presidential hopeful , Gov . Jay Inslee of Washington , that Trump is a white nationalist , he answered in the affirmative .\n\u201c Yes . I do . And again , from some of the record that I just recited to you , the things that he has said both as a candidate and then as the president of the United States , this can not be open for debate , \u201d he said , telling Tapper that \u201c you as well as I have a responsibility to call that out , to make sure that the American people understand what is being done in their name by the person who holds the highest position of public trust in this land . \u201d\nRyan stopped short of accusing Trump of being a white nationalist , but argued that he didn \u2019 t necessarily need to be one himself to motivate other white supremacists to violence .\nMourners gather at a vigil following a nearby mass shooting Aug. 4 , 2019 , in Dayton , Ohio . | John Minchillo/AP Photo\n\u201c Well , the white nationalists think he 's a white nationalist , and that 's the crux of the problem . They support him . The David Dukes of the world support him , \u201d he said on \u201c State of the Union , \u201d referring to Trump \u2019 s endorsement from the grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan . \u201c They said he 's going to implement their agenda . That 's all you need to know . \u201d\nWhether Trump means it or not , Ryan said , the president \u2019 s language is \u201c causing killings happening here in the United States . ... And he has to bear responsibility . \u201d\nWhile reviewing Trump \u2019 s rhetoric against immigrants , nearly every candidate referred to leaked private comments Trump made to Republican senators early in his term in which he referred to majority-black countries as \u201c shithole countries \u201d and wondered why the U.S. didn \u2019 t have more immigrants from majority-white countries .\n\u201c More than anything , of the laws and the executive orders , presidents of the United States , they create culture , \u201d Ryan said . \u201c And that culture can say , \u2019 We 're going to reach for the stars and we 're going to go to the moon , \u2019 or that culture can be , \u2019 Go back to where you came from or you come from a shithole country , \u2019 \u201d Ryan said .\nMick Mulvaney , the president \u2019 s acting chief of staff , offered a forceful defense of his boss on Sunday , dismissing the accusations being leveled at Trump as political attacks .\nIn appearances on \u201c This Week \u201d and \u201c Meet the Press , \u201d Mulvaney accused Democrats of employing a double standard when it came to Trump , referencing a Bernie Sanders supporter who opened fire on Republican lawmakers in 2017 and an attempted attack on a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Washington state carried out by a man echoing language used by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D-N.Y. ) .\n\u201c Let \u2019 s not lose sight of the fact that Beto O \u2019 Rourke , a former colleague of mine , who I hold in high regard , is running for president and the \u2014 to the extent he can make this an issue , he \u2019 s going to , \u201d Mulvaney said on \u201c This Week \u201d of his fellow former House member .\nOf Booker , Mulvaney declared that he wanted to have substantive conversations on addressing gun violence and would not be \u201c giving Cory Booker a chance to run for president this morning by blaming Donald Trump . \u201d\nBecause of a technical glitch , Mulvaney appeared on \u201c Meet the Press \u201d toward the end of the show , but sounded off on what he \u2019 d been listening to in the meantime .\n\u201c I know this is a political show , but the level of rhetoric in the last 20 minutes , I hope someone else is bothered by it , other than me , \u201d he said , calling the heated rhetoric he \u2019 d listened to from Booker and the show \u2019 s panelists \u201c really disappointing . \u201d\n\u201c I mean , we \u2019 ve moved straight past any sympathy at all for victims , straight past going into what caused this and trying to figure out who \u2019 s to blame , \u201d he added , becoming exasperated as Todd pressed him on whether Trump \u2019 s rhetoric was even partially to blame for the attacks .\n\u201c I blame the people who pulled the trigger , Chuck , goodness gracious . I mean , is someone really blaming the president ? \u201d he asked , noting that the manifesto potentially linked to the El Paso rampage explicitly said that the author harbored racist sentiments before Trump \u2019 s rise to power .\nMulvaney also pointed out that as president , Trump had banned bump stocks , a tool that essentially could convert a semiautomatic weapon into an automatic one , and had signed at least one background-check bill . The president also alluded to this on Sunday , saying that gun control measures he had enacted were \u201c just not really talked about very much . \u201d\nSen. Tim Scott ( R-S.C. ) offered a more measured criticism of how quickly Democrats had seized on the shootings to press for gun control , endorsing a different approach .\n\u201c The first thing I \u2019 d say is that we need to take a step back from politicizing every event , \u201d he said . \u201c This is an issue of human hate \u2014 something that resides in the heart and that is actually , unfortunately because of social technology and social media , we \u2019 re seeing it connect it to other folks who have hate in their heart as well . \u201d\nOther than Mulvaney , Scott and Rep. Will Hurd , whose Texas border district is just outside of El Paso , Sunday \u2019 s political talk shows were empty of big Republican names . Tapper began his show by listing Republican lawmakers who declined invitations to appear to discuss the shootings .\nPlaybook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what 's driving the afternoon in Washington .

Lindsey Graham ( R-S.C. ) for the enactment of so-called red flag laws that give law enforcement greater authority to confiscate weapons from those deemed dangerous .\nCongressional leaders also railed against Trump \u2019 s heated rhetoric , with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) echoing pleas for Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) to call senators back from their August recess to pass background-check legislation .\nIn a statement , Schumer also took a swipe at the president : \u201c When President Trump spends more time and energy denouncing Rep. Elijah Cummings and Baltimore than he does denouncing right-wing extremists who often traffic in hate and white nationalism , it shows his priorities are un-American and way off balance . \u201d\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D-Calif. ) whacked McConnell for not taking up background-check legislation passed by her chamber months ago .\n\u201c We have a responsibility to the people we serve to act , \u201d she said in a tweet . \u201c The @ SenateGOP must stop their outrageous obstruction & join the House to put an end to the horror and bloodshed that gun violence inflicts every day in America . \u201d\nMcConnell made no mention of the calls , which he is unlikely to heed , in a tweet calling the attacks \u201c sickening. \u201d The majority leader 's office later disclosed that the senator had fallen and fractured his shoulder at one point in the day , but had been in contact with senators in Texas and Ohio .",

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not lose sight of the fact that Beto O\u2019Rourke, a former colleague of mine, who I hold in high regard, is running for president and the \u2014 to the extent he can make this an issue, he\u2019s going to,\u201d Mulvaney said on \u201cThis Week\u201d of his fellow former House member.\n\nOf Booker, Mulvaney declared that he wanted to have substantive conversations on addressing gun violence and would not be \u201cgiving Cory Booker a chance to run for president this morning by blaming Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nBecause of a technical glitch, Mulvaney appeared on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d toward the end of the show, but sounded off on what he\u2019d been listening to in the meantime.\n\n\u201cI know this is a political show, but the level of rhetoric in the last 20 minutes, I hope someone else is bothered by it, other than me,\u201d he said, calling the heated rhetoric he\u2019d listened to from Booker and the show\u2019s panelists \u201creally disappointing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, we\u2019ve moved straight past any sympathy at all for victims, straight past going into what caused this and trying to figure out who\u2019s to blame,\u201d he added, becoming exasperated as Todd pressed him on whether Trump\u2019s rhetoric was even partially to blame for the attacks.\n\n\u201cI blame the people who pulled the trigger, Chuck, goodness gracious. I mean, is someone really blaming the president?\u201d he asked, noting that the manifesto potentially linked to the El Paso rampage explicitly said that the author harbored racist sentiments before Trump\u2019s rise to power.\n\nMulvaney also pointed out that as president, Trump had banned bump stocks, a tool that essentially could convert a semiautomatic weapon into an automatic one, and had signed at least one background-check bill. The president also alluded to this on Sunday, saying that gun control measures he had enacted were \u201cjust not really talked about very much.\u201d\n\nSen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) offered a more measured criticism of how quickly Democrats had seized on the shootings to press for gun control, endorsing a different approach.\n\n\u201cThe first thing I\u2019d say is that we need to take a step back from politicizing every event,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an issue of human hate \u2014 something that resides in the heart and that is actually, unfortunately because of social technology and social media, we\u2019re seeing it connect it to other folks who have hate in their heart as well.\u201d\n\nOther than Mulvaney, Scott and Rep. Will Hurd, whose Texas border district is just outside of El Paso, Sunday\u2019s political talk shows were empty of big Republican names. Tapper began his show by listing Republican lawmakers who declined invitations to appear to discuss the shootings.\n\nPlaybook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) for the enactment of so-called red flag laws that give law enforcement greater authority to confiscate weapons from those deemed dangerous.\n\nCongressional leaders also railed against Trump\u2019s heated rhetoric, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) echoing pleas for Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to call senators back from their August recess to pass background-check legislation.\n\nIn a statement, Schumer also took a swipe at the president: \u201cWhen President Trump spends more time and energy denouncing Rep. Elijah Cummings and Baltimore than he does denouncing right-wing extremists who often traffic in hate and white nationalism, it shows his priorities are un-American and way off balance.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) whacked McConnell for not taking up background-check legislation passed by her chamber months ago.\n\n\u201cWe have a responsibility to the people we serve to act,\u201d she said in a tweet. \u201cThe @SenateGOP must stop their outrageous obstruction & join the House to put an end to the horror and bloodshed that gun violence inflicts every day in America.\u201d\n\nMcConnell made no mention of the calls, which he is unlikely to heed, in a tweet calling the attacks \u201csickening.\u201d The majority leader's office later disclosed that the senator had fallen and fractured his shoulder at one point in the day, but had been in contact with senators in Texas and Ohio.\n\nNancy Cook contributed to this report.",
