( AP Photo/Alex Brandon , File )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) \u2014 Attorney General William Barr publicly swiped at President Donald Trump on Thursday , declaring the president \u2019 s tweets about Justice Department prosecutors and open cases \u201c make it impossible for me to do my job . \u201d\nBarr made the comment during an interview with ABC News just days after his Justice Department overruled its own prosecutors \u2014 who had recommended in a court filing that Trump \u2019 s longtime ally and confidant Roger Stone be sentenced to 7 to 9 years in prison \u2014 and took the extraordinary step of lowering the amount of prison time it would seek . The department didn \u2019 t offer an amended number .\nBarr himself has been under fire for the reversal . Still , it was a highly unusual move for a member of the Cabinet to criticize the president \u2014 especially a Trump loyalist who shares the president \u2019 s views on expansive executive powers .

But he stopped short of acknowledging wrongdoing by anyone .\nWhite House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Trump \u201c wasn \u2019 t bothered by the comments at all and he has the right , just like any American citizen , to publicly offer his opinions. \u201d She added , \u201c The President has full faith and confidence in Attorney General Barr to do his job and uphold the law . \u201d\nBut Trump has a low tolerance for criticism , especially public criticism , from his allies and often fires back in kind . And the tempered White House response raised questions of whether Barr \u2019 s comments were coordinated with the White House .\nBarr said Trump \u2019 s tweets created perception problems for the department that called into question its independence , but he denied there was any order from Trump and said Trump \u2019 s tweets did not factor into the decision .\nBarr joined a roster of high level aides who have publicly criticized Trump , thought the rest left the job first . Former National Security Adviser John Bolton is to publish a book next month detailing his time in the White House including criticism of Trump actions such as his decision to withhold military assistance while seeking a political favor from Ukraine . Former Chief of Staff John Kelly , who has largely kept a low profile since leaving the White House , has grown more open about his unflattering assessments of the president .\nEarlier this week , Trump applauded Barr on Twitter for the decision to reverse the sentencing recommendation , writing : \u201c Congratulations to Attorney General Bill Barr for taking charge of a case that was totally out of control and perhaps should not have even been brought . \u201d\nThe department insisted the decision to undo the sentencing recommendation was made Monday night \u2014 before Trump blasted the recommendation on Twitter as \u201c very horrible and unfair \u201d \u2014 and prosecutors had not spoken to the White House about it . The about-face prompted the four attorneys who prosecuted Stone to quit the case . One left the Justice Department altogether .\n\u201c I \u2019 m happy to say that , in fact , the president has never asked me to do anything in a criminal case , \u201d Barr said in the ABC interview . \u201c However , to have public statements and tweets made about the department , about our people ... about cases pending in the department , and about judges before whom we have cases , make it impossible for me to do my job and to assure the courts and the prosecutors in the department that we \u2019 re doing our work with integrity . \u201d\nNational security adviser Robert O \u2019 Brien told reporters Thursday evening at the White House that Trump tweets to bypass the mainstream press and speak directly to the American people .\n\u201c It \u2019 s just a different method of communicating with the American people and the president has every right to weigh in , \u201d O \u2019 Brien said . \u201c He \u2019 s got First Amendment rights , even though he \u2019 s president .

Administration officials said senior White House aides were not informed of the contents of Barr \u2019 s interview before it aired .\n\u201c As I said during my confirmation , I came in to serve as attorney general . I am responsible for everything that happens in the department , but the thing I have most responsibility for are the issues that are brought to me for decision , \u201d Barr said in the interview .\nIt is extremely rare for Justice Department leaders to reverse the decision of prosecutors on a sentencing recommendation , particularly after that recommendation has been submitted to the court . The actual sentencing is up to the judge .\nMeanwhile , the Chief Judge of the D.C. District Court , Beryl A. Howell , also did something unusual : She issued a statement Thursday on the firestorm around the sentencing .\n\u201c The Judges of this court base their sentencing decisions on careful consideration of the actual record in the case before them ; the applicable sentencing guidelines and statutory factors ; the submissions of the parties , the probation office and victims ; and their own judgment and experience , \u201d she wrote . \u201c Public criticism or pressure is not a factor . \u201d\n\u201c What they did to Roger Stone was a disgrace , \u201d Trump said Thursday during an interview with Geraldo Rivera on Cleveland \u2019 s Newsradio WTAM .\nHe said of the prosecutors who resigned in protest : \u201c I don \u2019 t think they quit the case . ...

You have some of the most serious horrible rapists and everything else . They don \u2019 t go to jail for nine years , \u201d Trump said .\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsay Graham said in a statement that Barr \u201c has my complete confidence \u201d and \u201c is the right man at the right time to reform the department and stand up for the Rule of Law . \u201d\nEarlier this week , Graham said , and Barr later confirmed , that Justice was accepting information that Trump \u2019 s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani is gathering in Ukraine about Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden and his son .\nIn the ABC interview , Barr said of the president , \u201c If he were to say go investigate somebody because \u2014 and you sense it \u2019 s because they \u2019 re a political opponent \u2014 then the attorney general shouldn \u2019 t carry that out , wouldn \u2019 t carry that out . \u201d\nDemocrats decried the Justice Department \u2019 s reversal on Stone and called for immediate investigations .
