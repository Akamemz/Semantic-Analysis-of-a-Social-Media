    "content": "I \u2019 m standing in a seemingly ordinary construction site of an unremarkable office block in east London . The seven-storey building is about two-thirds complete \u2013 the basic structure and staircases are in place , with plastering and wiring just beginning . But as I walk around , something different slowly reveals itself . The construction site is quiet and clean \u2013 it even smells good . And there \u2019 s an awful lot of wood . Building sites typically feature wood as the mould to pour the concrete into . But here , the wood is the concrete .\n\u201c Because a timber building weighs 20 % of a concrete building , the gravitational load is vastly reduced , \u201d enthuses Andrew Waugh , the architect , who shows me around . \u201c That means we need minimal foundations , we don \u2019 t need massive amounts of concrete in the ground . We have a timber core , timber walls and timber floor slabs \u2013 so we reduce the amount of steel down to a bare minimum. \u201d Steel is typically used to form the main internal supports or to reinforce concrete in most large modern buildings . In this wooden building , however , there are relatively few steel sections . Those that remain are bolted together like a Meccano set , to be easily taken apart at the end of ( or during ) the building \u2019 s life . \u201c If you wanted to put a staircase right here , \u201d says Waugh , pointing to the ceiling , \u201c you unscrew that [ steel ] beam there , get a chainsaw and cut a hole in the timber [ floor ] . \u201d\nGlobally , enough concrete is poured each year to cover the whole of England\nOur dependency on concrete and steel to build everything from homes to sports stadiums , comes at a severe environmental cost . Concrete is responsible for 4-8 % of the world \u2019 s carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) emissions . Second only to water , it is the most widely used substance on Earth , accounting for around 85 % of all mining and linked to an alarming depletion of the world \u2019 s sand . Globally , enough concrete is poured each year to cover the whole of England .\nSome architects such as Waugh are therefore arguing for \u2013 and pressing ahead with \u2013 a return to wood as our primary building material . Wood from managed forestry actually stores carbon as opposed to emitting it : as trees grow , they absorb CO2 from the atmosphere . As a rule of thumb , a cubic metre of wood contains around a tonne of CO2 ( more or less , depending on the species of tree ) \u2013 which is similar to 350 litres of gasoline .\nNot only does wood remove more CO2 from the atmosphere than it adds through manufacture , but by replacing carbon-intensive materials such as concrete or steel it doubles its contribution to lowering CO2 . A recent advisory report to the UK government on the uses of \u201c Biomass in a low-carbon economy \u201d found that , \u201c the greatest levels of [ greenhouse gas ] abatement from biomass currently occur when wood is used as a construction material\u2026 to both store carbon and displace high carbon cement , brick and steel . \u201d\nBetween 15 % and 28 % of new homes built in the UK annually use timber frame construction , capturing over one million tonnes of CO2 a year as a result . Increasing the use of timber in construction could triple that amount , the report concluded . \u201c Savings of a similar magnitude may also be possible in the commercial and industrial sectors by utilising new engineered wood systems such as cross-laminated timber . \u201d\nCross-laminated timber , or CLT , is the primary material on the construction site Andrew Waugh shows me around in east London . Because it \u2019 s described as an \u201c engineered wood \u201d , I expect to see something similar to chipboard or plywood . But CLT just looks like ordinary 3m ( 10ft ) planks of wood , one inch thick , replete with knot-holes and splinters . The ingenuity is that the planks are made stronger by gluing them in layers of three , with each layer perpendicular to the other . This means that the CLT \u201c doesn \u2019 t bow or bend , it has integral strength in two directions \u201d , says Waugh . \u201c [ A CLT ] wall supports the floor above , with a horizontal strength to carry a load above it , acting like a long beam \u201d . That , he says , \u201c changes architecture \u201d .\nHaving built with CLT for a decade now , Waugh believes it can achieve anything a concrete and steel building can , and more besides . It was invented in the 1990s , partly in response to \u201c the death of the furniture and paper industries \u201d , says Waugh . \u201c Sixty percent of Austria is forest and they needed to find a new sales outlet . So , they came up with cross-laminated timber . \u201d\nOther engineered woods such as plywood and MDF are around 10 % adhesive ( glue ) , often urea-formaldehyde , which can produce hazardous chemicals during recycling or incineration . CLT , however , is below 1 % adhesive , and typically uses a bio-based polyurethane . The planks are bonded together under heat and pressure to fuse that small amount of adhesive using the moisture of the wood . To look at , smell and touch , it \u2019 s as pure wood as a child \u2019 s tree house \u2013 knots and all .\nMany CLT factories in Austria are even powered by renewable biomass using the offcuts , branches and twigs . Some factories produce enough electricity to power the surrounding communities .\nDespite the fact that CLT was invented in Austria , Waugh \u2019 s London-based architecture practice , Waugh Thistleton , was the first to use it to construct a multi-storey building . Murray Grove , an otherwise ordinary nine-floor apartment block with grey cladding , caused \u201c shock and horror in Austria \u201d when it was being built in 2009 , says Waugh . CLT had only ever been used for \u201c nice and simple two-storey houses \u201d , whereas anything taller reverted to concrete and steel . But for Murray Grove , the entire structure above the first floor slab is comprised of CLT panels , with all walls , floor slabs and lift cores formed from timber , like a honeycomb block .\nThe project has since inspired hundreds of architects to build tall with CLT , from the 55m Brock Commons Tallwood House , in Vancouver , Canada , to the 84m , 24-storey 'HoHo Tower ' currently under construction in Vienna , Austria .\nSince 2001 , Canada \u2019 s forests have emitted more CO2 than they absorbed\nRecently there have been calls for tree planting on a colossal scale to capture CO2 and curb climate change . However , whilst young trees are efficient and effective carbon sinks , the same is not so true for mature trees . The Earth maintains a balanced carbon cycle \u2013 trees ( along with all other plants and animals ) grow using carbon , they fall and die , and release that carbon again . That balance was knocked out of kilter when humans discovered ancient stores of carbon in the form of coal and oil , which had been captured during previous carbon cycles , and began burning them , releasing the resulting CO2 into our atmosphere far faster than the current cycle can deal with .\nMany pine trees in managed forests , such as the European spruce , take roughly 80 years to reach maturity , being net absorbers of carbon during those years of growth \u2013 but once they reach maturity , they shed roughly as much carbon through the decomposition of needles and fallen branches as they absorb . As was the case in Austria in the 1990s , plummeting demand for paper and wood saw huge swathes of managed forests globally fall into disuse . Rather than return to pristine wilderness , these monocrops cover forest floors in acidic pine needles and dead branches . Canada 's great forests for example have actually emitted more carbon than they absorb since 2001 , thanks to mature trees no longer being actively felled .\nArguably , the best form of carbon sequestration is to chop down trees : to restore our sustainable , managed forests , and use the resulting wood as a building material . Managed forests certified by the Forest Stewardship Council ( FSC ) typically plant two to three trees for every tree felled \u2013 meaning the more demand there is for wood , the greater the growth in both forest cover and CO2-hungry young trees .\nRewilding and protecting virgin forests is essential . But unmanaged monocrops help no-one , and floors full of dry pine needles are also the primary cause of wildfires \u2013 something that North America and many parts of the world experience on a now annual basis . Managed harvesting greatly reduces that risk .\nThese benefits have not been lost on the US authorities . Melissa Jenkins , of the US Federal Forest Service , explained at a recent meeting of the Environmental and Energy Study Institute ( EESI ) , that \u201c we have a situation of overstocked forests : if a wildfire blows through , these fires burn hotter , they burn faster and they take a lot more effort to put out\u2026 If we can build markets for these wood products , landowners will be more likely to sustainably manage or sustainably thin their land. \u201d She highlights that CLT in particular as having the potential to reduce \u201c wildfire risk [ and ] support rural economic development and jobs \u201d .\nThe market seems to agree . Less than five years after its arrival on US shores , there are now CLT projects underway in almost every mainland US state . More importantly , unlike the UK \u2013 which currently imports all of its CLT \u2013 the US is investing in domestic CLT manufacturing , with factories in Montana and Oregon , and more planned in Maine , Utah , Illinois , Texas , Washington State , Alabama and Arkansas . Amazon \u2019 s new \u201c tech-hub \u201d building in Minneapolis is made from nail laminated timber ( like CLT , but using nails rather than glue ) . The 2018 Timber Innovation Act also included provisions for research and development into mass timber .\nStructures using wooden materials also tend to be quicker and easier to build , therefore reducing labour costs , transport fuel and on-site energy use . Alison Wring , director of Aecom , an infrastructure company , cites a CLT residential block of around 200 apartments that \u201c took just 16 weeks [ to build ] \u2026 whereas if it had been done traditionally with a concrete frame it would have taken at least 26 weeks. \u201d Similarly , says Waugh , a recent 16,000-square-metre CLT building he worked on , \u201c would have needed around 1,000 cement truck deliveries for the frame alone . To deliver all the CLT , we needed just 92 deliveries . \u201d\nOther countries are turning to timber , too . Monika Lebeni\u010dnik , a sales engineer for Ledinek Engineering , an Austrian-Slovenian firm that makes the presses for CLT factories , sent me her order sheet going back to 2013 . It begins with a trickle of orders from Austria and Scandinavia . But from 2017 onwards , there is sudden take-up from Japan , France , Australia , Latvia and Canada . \u201c Annual capacity of such lines range from 25,000 to 50,000 cubic meters [ of CLT ] , \u201d explains Lebeni\u010dnik . Data suggests that 1,000 cubic metres of CLT equates to around 500 harvested trees ; factories processing 50,000 cubic metres are therefore trapping the sequestered carbon of 25,000 trees per year .\nThere are even advantages that make the material particularly attractive to countries like Japan , since it has been found to perform well in earthquake tests . A joint Italian-Japanese research team built a seven-storey CLT building and tested it on a \u201c shake table \u201d ( a cool but eerie video of this exists on Youtube ) . They found that it could withstand shaking at the level of the 1995 earthquake in Kobe , Japan , which destroyed more than 50,000 buildings . With serendipitous timing , says Waugh , \u201c the Americans planted lots of trees in Japan as part of the Marshall Plan \u2013 that was over 60 years ago , and they are reaching maturity now \u201d .\nCounterintuitively , CLT also performs well in fires . It is designed to withstand heats of up to 270C before it begins to char \u2013 the charring on the outside then acts as a protective layer for the structural density of the wood behind it . By contrast , at similar temperatures concrete can spall and crack , and steel loses its strength .\nNot everyone believes that the future is CLT , however . When I ask Chris Cheeseman , professor of materials resources engineering at Imperial College London , whether wood could usurp concrete as our primary building material , his response is blunt . \u201c No . That isn \u2019 t going to happen . It might happen locally with some small schemes . But you \u2019 ve got to appreciate the massive use of concrete , and the massive importance of concrete to infrastructure and society . It is an exceptionally good material because of its functionality and its robustness . \u201d\nThere is also the \u201c end of life \u201d question . Carbon only remains trapped in the wood for as long as the building remains standing or is reused in another building \u2013 if it rots or is burned for energy , then all the stored carbon is released . Doug King , a chartered engineer and building sustainability advisor , tells me , \u201c unless we attend to the disposal of timber materials at their end of life there is no guarantee that the overall cycle is making a positive benefit to society. \u201d Previous research work by Arup in 2014 estimated that half of all construction timber ends up in landfill , 36 % is recycled and the remaining 14 % burnt for biomass energy .\nDespite these issues , Waugh remains ambitious . The average lifetime of a building is 50-60 years \u2013 that , he believes , is more than enough time for architects and engineers to work out the re-use and recycling issues .
