    "content": "President Trump faced harsh bipartisan criticism back home for his Helsinki press conference with Vladimir Putin on Monday , as lawmakers claimed the U.S. president missed a chance to `` stand up '' to the Russian president on election meddling .\nThe U.S. president , for his part , called the summit with Putin `` deeply productive . '' After Democrats for days called on him to nix the meeting in the wake of indictments against Russian officers for U.S. campaign hacking , Trump said he would `` not make decisions on foreign policy in a futile effort to appease partisan critics . ''\nHe cited progress on a range of issues , and said it would be a `` good thing '' to get along with Russia .\nHowever , the president angered members of both parties by saying both countries share blame for damaged relations and by not firmly standing by U.S. intelligence assessments that Russia meddled in the 2016 elections .\nTrump said he has great confidence in the intelligence community , but Putin gave a `` strong and powerful '' denial .
