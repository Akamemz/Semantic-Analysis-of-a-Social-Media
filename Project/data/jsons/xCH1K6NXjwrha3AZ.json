    "content": "The level of chaos in President Trump \u2019 s administration right now is astounding \u2014 even for him .\nThe White House chief of staff is out \u2014 after the new communications director went on a profane , public rant insulting him . ( Naturally , the communications director is still in . )\nThe president has been publicly berating the attorney general in an apparent effort to get him to resign , while rumors fly that Trump wants to fire the special counsel investigating his campaign .\nThe press secretary has quit , and there are yet more rumors that either the secretary of state or the ( second ) national security adviser could be next .\nAll of this is clearly born of the president \u2019 s frustration with how his administration has gone so far . Trump is unpopular , his legislative agenda has stalled , and his presidency could be in serious legal danger from the Russia investigation . So he very clearly ( and understandably ) wants to make changes .\nBut the way he \u2019 s going about it \u2014 by publicly humiliating officials who have long supported him but are now out of favor \u2014 is downright deranged . And it will make his problems far worse in the long run , as competent and qualified people will choose to stay far away rather than risk similar disgrace .\nAmazingly , it \u2019 s not Scaramucci but Priebus who was ousted after Scaramucci \u2019 s rant\nTake the profane , violent tirade that newly minted White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci recently delivered to New Yorker reporter Ryan Lizza . \u201c Unprofessional \u201d doesn \u2019 t even begin to cover it .\nScaramucci mocked his co-workers , calling Priebus a \u201c fucking paranoid schizophrenic , a paranoiac \u201d and saying Steve Bannon was \u201c trying to suck [ his ] own cock . \u201d\nHe threatened to \u201c fucking kill all the leakers \u201d in the administration .\nHe ( falsely ) accused Priebus of leaking his financial disclosures and claimed to have called the FBI and Department of Justice on him ( the White House chief of staff ! ) .\nFinally , Scaramucci openly admitted , at the end of the conversation , that he was planning to \u201c start tweeting some shit to make this guy [ Priebus ] crazy \u201d \u2014 and then did so :\nNaturally , then , the person who was ousted from the administration on Friday was not Anthony Scaramucci but instead Reince Priebus .\nAnd amazingly enough , Trump may have come away from this controversy not with a lower opinion of Scaramucci but of Priebus .
