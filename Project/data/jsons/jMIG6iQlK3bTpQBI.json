    "content": "The White House said Monday that an alarming spike in COVID-19 cases across the South and West does not amount to a second wave in the pandemic , and it pointed to a declining death rate and nationwide trend that is heading in \u201c the right direction . \u201d\nEven as cases surged in Arizona , Florida and Texas , where the governor said the virus is spreading at an \u201c unacceptable rate , \u201d administration officials said flare-ups will be managed as the country reopens .\n\u201c There are some hot spots . We \u2019 re on it . We know how to deal with this stuff now . It \u2019 s come a long way since last winter , and there is no second wave coming , \u201d White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on CNBC .\nWhite House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Monday that it \u2019 s \u201c a tragedy anytime a life is lost to coronavirus , \u201d but the administration was pleased to see fewer than 300 deaths reported the previous day .\n\u201c We are trending in the right direction , \u201d she said . \u201c We are aware when there are rises here and there . And those embers , we are equipped to go in and handle and put [ them ] out and to save as many lives as possible . \u201d\nMr. Trump , meanwhile , reiterated his belief that expanded testing is making the U.S. look bad .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve done too good a job because every time we go up with 25 million tests , you \u2019 re going to find more people , so then they say , \u2018 Oh , we have more cases in the United States , \u2019 \u201d he told Scripps Networks Interactive at the White House .\nPublic health experts said they are worried that the spike in the number of cases in the Sun Belt goes far beyond testing capacity . They cited an increase in hospitalizations and rate of positive test results .\nArizona \u2019 s positivity rate hit 20 % , and Florida \u2019 s topped 10 % . Public health experts say the rate should be less than 10 % to be confident that officials are detecting an adequate number of cases and isolating the infected .\nIn Texas , the positivity rate has gone from 4.5 % in late May to almost 9 % . Hospitalizations have surged from a seven-day average of 1,600 per day in late May to 3,200 per day .\n\u201c To state the obvious , COVID-19 is now spreading at an unacceptable rate in Texas and it must be corralled , \u201d said Gov . Greg Abbott , a Republican .\nHe said Texas can reel in the coronavirus without shutting down again . The state is increasing testing capacity in potential hot spots , he said , and regulators are shutting down bars that aren \u2019 t in compliance with social distancing rules .\nMr. Abbott has not issued a statewide mandate but is pleading with people to wear masks . He said masks are effective tools in defeating COVID-19 and keeping businesses open .\n\u201c This is not going to be a permanent assignment , \u201d Mr. Abbott said .\nIn California , meanwhile , Gov . Gavin Newsom and former governors in both parties emphasized the importance of wearing masks to block potentially infectious droplets that are emitted by talking , sneezing or coughing .\nMr. Newsom last week ordered Californians to wear masks in public because of single-day highs in cases in Los Angeles County and elsewhere , indicating that the coronavirus is still circulating .\n\u201c It didn \u2019 t go away just because your mall is open at 50 % capacity , \u201d former Gov . Arnold Schwarzenegger said in the video clip .\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says people should wear face masks in areas where it is difficult to remain physically distant from others , such as grocery stores . Still , there is plenty of evidence that people aren \u2019 t using face coverings in many public areas , including at Mr. Trump \u2019 s campaign rally Saturday .\n\u201c It \u2019 s disheartening to see the number of individuals not wearing masks at some events or some parties or things like that , \u201d said Michael Mina , an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H . Chan School of Public Health . \u201c I worry that the populace might not take to wearing masks diligently . \u201d\nIncreased transmission appears to be among younger populations .
