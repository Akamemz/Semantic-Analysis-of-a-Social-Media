But take a closer look at the amounts . The size of the losses for lower incomes is dwarfed by the massive gains \u2014 up to $ 59,000 per tax filer \u2014 at the upper end of the income scale .\nOk , but don \u2019 t the wealthy get more of a nominal benefit because they have much larger incomes ? Isn \u2019 t it all nearly even when you factor in the higher and lower incomes involved ?\nActually , no . We took the midpoint for income in each group ( for example , $ 15,000 for those earning between $ 10,000 and $ 20,000 ) and divided the overall effect on the group by that income amount . The result ? As you can see in the next chart , the wealthy not only gain the most in dollar amounts but they also gain the most relative to their income .\nFor instance , Americans making $ 10,000 to $ 20,000 would see barely any change \u2014 a loss worth just 0.14 percent of their income next year . But Americans making $ 500,000 to $ 1 million next year would see a net benefit that \u2019 s worth nearly 3 percent of their income .\nAnd a final question what about the population size of each group ? Doesn \u2019 t that change the math here ? Again , no .\nBelow , we crunched the data for the percentage of federal tax returns which come from each income group , and compared that to relative size of the benefit or loss for each group .\nOur numbers show a very clear reversal : lower income groups have larger amounts of taxpayers but would benefit far less from this tax overhaul . Higher income groups have far fewer taxpayers , and would gain many times more from the GOP bill .\nOf course , Republicans correctly point out that the wealthy , while fewer in number , pay for a much larger portion of U.S. taxes than other groups .

In particular, we want to look at the latest numbers from the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThe CBO report, which came out Sunday, was unusual because it does not just look at the Senate bill\u2019s impact on people\u2019s taxes. It also analyzes spending cuts the GOP tax plan would trigger, and how those cuts would affect the rich and poor.\n\nAs you will see, our analysis of the new data shows the Senate Republicans\u2019 bill would move resources away from lower-income Americans and toward upper and upper-middle class Americans.\n\nHow much each family or taxpayer gains or loses\n\nWe started by looking at what the tax bill means for each person or family. (Note: A \u201ctax unit\u201d is one person or group filing one tax return. So an individual could be one tax unit and a married couple filing jointly could be one.)\n\nHighlighted in red, you can see lower-income groups face overall losses, per person or family, in this plan. But take a closer look at the amounts. The size of the losses for lower incomes is dwarfed by the massive gains \u2014 up to $59,000 per tax filer \u2014 at the upper end of the income scale.\n\nOk, but don\u2019t the wealthy get more of a nominal benefit because they have much larger incomes?
