    "content": "I \u2019 ll say it again , there is not a single candidate currently running that will beat Donald Trump in 2020 . Not one . Unless someone steps up his or her game big league , Donald Trump is going to win a second term as president of the United States . Now , that being said , after tonight \u2019 s CNN Democratic debate , there had to have been a winner . I thought Sen. Bernie Sanders was one of them . He needed to be feisty , aggressive , and willing to attack . He did that , but he will need to destroy his best pal , Sen. Elizabeth Warren , to start a foundation from which he can reach the top of the 2020 field . It remains to be seen whether he \u2019 s willing to engage in that sort of campaign . Yet , that brings us to Marianne Williamson . She puts the \u201c side \u201d in the outsider . We \u2019 re in the era of the political outsider . And with Williamson , she \u2019 s way out there , but she also had the better moments of tonight \u2019 s debate , clinching some of the biggest applause lines , spikes in Google searches , and appeared to have what the others don \u2019 t : something new to offer .\nDon \u2019 t get me wrong . There \u2019 s no way I \u2019 m voting for her , but her brand of politics shouldn \u2019 t be dismissed . She \u2019 s also feisty . And seemed to inject some energy into that CNN audience . Warren , Sanders , Klobuchar , Buttigieg , Ryan , Bullock , Hickenlooper , and Delaney all had the same politician-packaged lines , which came off as rather stale . There \u2019 s no life with this crop . None . And once again , the field showed that they \u2019 re nuts . We discussed nuclear weapons policy , which proved why the GOP is trusted more on national security issues , health care for illegals , open borders , gun control , and whether or not we \u2019 ll destroy private health insurance for millions of Americans now or later . The public option , an aspect of the original Obamacare legislation that was axed because it was viewed as a poison pill , was discussed as well . All of these are losing issues , so whoever is the nominee , especially someone who is viewed as being able to win back blue-collar Democrats\u2014cough * Biden cough * \u2013this agenda will not do that . If it 's Biden in 2020 , he 'll be viewed as a Democrat with a working-class background promoting an agenda that mocks , denigrates , and targets\u2026those with working-class backgrounds .\nEveryone in America : Who is Marianne Williamson and why is she winning this debate ?\nEveryone in Montana : Who is this guy that claims to be our governor ? ! ? pic.twitter.com/x0ayDRMF8H \u2014 Josh Jordan ( @ NumbersMuncher ) July 31 , 2019\nFinal tally : Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders got the most speaking time during the Democratic debate https : //t.co/goLnYVx9dS \u2014 The New York Times ( @ nytimes ) July 31 , 2019\nAfter interviewing Elizabeth Warren , 11-year-old reporter more impressed by Marianne Williamsonhttps : //t.co/GtIYxFagRg pic.twitter.com/KBL5k2rGZR \u2014 RNC Research ( @ RNCResearch ) July 30 , 2019\nMarianne Williamson just got the biggest applause of the night : pic.twitter.com/E33pOIYP2f \u2014 Caleb Hull ( @ CalebJHull ) July 31 , 2019\nDemocratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson says she has `` some concern \u201d that `` Medicare for All '' will make it difficult for Democrats to win in 2020 . - CNN\nMarianne Williamson : `` In a way , the fact that people are so invested in creating this false narrative about me as the \u2018 crystal lady , \u2019 \u2018 wacky new-age nutcase ' -- if you really think about it , I must be doing something right that they \u2019 re so scared , do n't you think ?
