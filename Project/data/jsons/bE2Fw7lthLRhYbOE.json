He held the panel to face the setting Colorado sun , adjusting its angle to vary the fan speed .\n\u201c Want to hear a secret ? \u201d he asked the kids around him . \u201c This is the only science class I ever got an A in . \u201d\nAs he readily acknowledges , Baty hasn \u2019 t been the most enthusiastic science student at Delta High School . This class , however , is different . Along with a group of other seniors and a few juniors , Baty is enrolled in \u201c Solar Energy Training. \u201d The class not only provides a science credit needed for graduation ; it also trains students for careers in solar energy or the electrical trades . It allows Baty to work with his hands , something he enjoys , while positioning him for employment in a fast-growing industry .\nIn Colorado \u2019 s North Fork Valley , solar energy\u2014along with a strong organic farm economy and recreation dollars\u2014is helping to fill the economic hole left by the dying coal industry , which sustained the area for more than 120 years . When the mines still ran , graduating seniors could step immediately into good-paying jobs . But in the past five years , two of Delta County \u2019 s three mines have closed . Approximately 900 local mining jobs have been lost in the past decade . Ethan Bates , for example , another senior in the solar energy training class , is the son of a mine foreman who lost his job when the Bowie Mine outside Paonia closed in 2016 . Now , he \u2019 ll graduate as a certified solar panel installer .\nNational environmental and climate groups often discuss \u201c just transitions \u201d for fossil-fuel dependent communities like Delta , or Wyoming \u2019 s Powder River Basin . Mining companies are going bankrupt , while every year , solar and other renewables get cheaper . Such economic shifts are complex , but one thing is clear : If the transition to renewables is to truly account for the communities and economies it undercuts , it will include programs like Delta High School \u2019 s solar training . The class positions young people for success in a coal-free future , and does so from the ground up , attentive to the needs and cares of the local community .\nScience teacher Ben Graves started the class four years ago . Described by a student as \u201c cool \u201d but with a \u201c mad-scientist vibe , \u201d Graves has a salt-and-pepper beard and dresses casually in trail-running shoes and hardwearing khaki pants . In class , he is affable but authoritative .\nAs a teacher , Graves sees his main duty as educating young people and creating good citizens . But to do right by his students , he needs to set them up for success under the current economic realities . And that requires classes like solar training . \u201c I think we have to be doing some sort of trades education , \u201d he said . \u201c For a kid with a high school diploma , working service is really all you can do without more training . \u201d\nMany students in the solar class , like Baty , weren \u2019 t particularly successful in traditional science classes . They \u2019 re kids who haven \u2019 t \u201c played the school game , \u201d as Graves put it , of college admission and standardized tests . For these students , training in electrical trades has now joined ranks with welding and agriculture programs offered by the high school .\nIn the past four years , the class has helped install two solar arrays behind Delta High School . Students have done much of the work designing the structures and digging the trenches to lay conduit cables . This year for their final project , they will take apart and fully re-install one of the solar arrays . According to Graves , teachers at other local schools are keen to integrate solar training into their classes . Solar Energy International , a local nonprofit and a major catalyst behind the Delta class , is working to integrate solar training into science curriculum across the region .\nThese projects are a boon to public school budgets , which lost a tax base when the mines closed . On a school day , the projects can supply about 10 percent of Delta High School \u2019 s energy demand\u2014up to 30 percent on weekends . Thanks to a municipal cap , Graves said , the school has reached the limit on how much solar it can install , but even the current amount makes a difference .\n\u201c The facilities folks at first waved it away as a class project , \u201d Graves said with a laugh . \u201c Now , maintenance sees it as a real way to reduce demand charges . It went from us pushing some of this stuff on the administration to them saying , \u2018 Wait a second , we actually want this . ' \u201d\nThe economics of renewables are changing Delta at the county level , too . The area \u2019 s electric cooperative , Delta-Montrose Electric Association ( DMEA ) is ending its contract with its wholesale power supplier , Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association . Tri-State long required that buyers like DMEA purchase 95 percent of their electricity from the utility , limiting the amount of solar and other renewables local co-ops could produce . The company is notorious for its continued reliance on coal-fired power plants .\nFor many Delta residents , solar offers a certain self-sufficiency and local independence they find appealing , as evidenced by DMEA \u2019 s defection from corporate control . It \u2019 s also cheaper : DMEA can cut customer costs by increasing its share of renewable power . As a rural electric co-op , DMEA \u2019 s members call the shots , and in October 2018 , they voted to raise money and sell stocks in order to buy out their Tri-State contract . Politically , Delta County might not be an obvious leader in renewable energy ; it voted for President Trump by about 70 percent . But solar panels on homes and businesses are increasingly common , with demand sometimes outstripping the capacity of local solar firms .\nIn the school district where Graves works , DMEA has encouraged the adoption of solar by funding solar arrays at every high school in its service area . Through SEI , the co-op has administered grants for Graves \u2019 class , and it funds solar trainings for teachers across the area .\nFrom an educational view , the solar class \u2019 value rests in its capacity to combine technical training and scientific learning outside the traditional grade structure .
