But the U.S. Supreme Court has rarely weighed in on the issue . In modern times , it has ruled decisively just twice . Now it 's on the brink of doing so again .\nWith the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy , there now are five conservative justices who may be willing to shut down many attempts at regulation , just as the NRA 's lock on state legislatures may be waning .\nFor the past decade , the court has been wary of gun cases . In 2008 the court ruled for the first time that the Second Amendment right to bear arms is an individual right . Two years later , the court said that right applied to state laws , not just federal laws regulating gun ownership and use . Since then , however , there has been radio silence as the justices have turned away challenges , one after another , to gun laws across the country . Until now .\nOn Monday the court hears arguments in a case from New York , a city and a state with some of the toughest gun regulations in the country . Several gun owners and the NRA 's New York affiliate challenged the rules for having a handgun at home . They contended the city gun license was so restrictive it was unconstitutional .\nSpecifically , they said the state law and city regulations violated the right to bear arms because they forbid handgun owners from carrying their pistols anywhere other than seven firing ranges within the city limits . That meant that pistol owners could not carry their guns to a second home , or to shooting ranges or competitions in other states nearby . The lower courts upheld the regulations as justified to protect safety in the most densely populated city in the country .\nBut when the Supreme Court agreed to hear the gun owners ' appeal , the state and the city changed the law to allow handgun owners to transport their locked and unloaded guns to second homes or shooting ranges outside the city .\nWith those changes , the first question Monday will be whether the case is moot and should be thrown out because New York has already given the gun owners everything they asked for in their lawsuit .\n`` This is an instance where it appears the petitioners wo n't say 'yes ' for an answer , '' says James Johnson , counsel for the city of New York .\nBut former Solicitor General Paul Clement , who represents the gun owners , counters that the amended regulations still give the city too much power to regulate .\n`` The city of New York never expressed any doubt about the constitutionality of these regulations when they were winning in the district court and the court of appeals , '' argues Clement . `` And then lo and behold , all of a sudden the city decides you know maybe we do n't need these regulations after all . ''\nAnd , he observes , the city is still defending the original regulations .\nThe city is indeed doing that because the justices refused in October to throw the case out on mootness grounds , opting instead to hear the mootness arguments today , along with the direct challenge to the regulations themselves .\nThat does put the city in a weird position . The city is forced to defend regulations that are no longer in place , and that it claims it has no intention of reviving .\n`` It 's our position that by justifiably restricting the ability to carry firearms broadly on the streets of New York , it contributes to making the city safe , '' says Johnson .\nAnd there 's the rub . What did the Supreme Court mean in its 2008 decision when it said that the right to bear arms is an individual right ? Back then , Justice Antonin Scalia , writing for the five justice court majority , framed the right most explicitly as the right to own a gun for self-defense in one 's home .\nMoreover , the opinion contained a paragraph of specific qualifiers that , according to court sources , were added to Scalia 's opinion at the insistence of Justice Kennedy , who provided the fifth vote needed to prevail in the case . The court said , for instance , that its opinion `` cast no doubt on '' longstanding bans on `` carrying firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings , or bans on dangerous and unusual weapons .
