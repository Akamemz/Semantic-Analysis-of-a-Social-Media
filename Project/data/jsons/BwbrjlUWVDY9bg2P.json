He said his was a campaign that \u201c tells the powerful special interests who control so much of our economic and political life that we will no longer tolerate the greed of Wall Street , corporate America and the billionaire class \u201d .\nDuring a road trip through the state days later , the former Texas congressman Beto O \u2019 Rourke stopped at a university in Keene to lament an economy that only works for \u201c the very few \u201d . \u201c We never had this kind of income and wealth inequality unless you go all the way back to the last Gilded Age , \u201d he said .\nMuch has been said about the unprecedented diversity among Democrats vying to replace Donald Trump in the White House in 2020 . But voters in New Hampshire , which will hold the first in the nation primary next year , can be forgiven for feeling they all sound kind of similar .\nReporters on the campaign trail constantly ask Democrats if they self-define as a \u201c socialist \u201d or \u201c capitalist \u201d . Yet a better label for several of the frontrunners may be \u201c populist \u201d \u2013 at least in the moderate , diluted form in which the term is commonly used in the US .\nThat reflects a wider populist turn in Democratic politics , born from a realisation that in 2016 it was Trump , a real estate billionaire , who did better than Democrat Hillary Clinton at channeling widespread voter frustration at economic elites .\nNow Trump has become emblematic of the swamp he once promised to drain . The president has given tax cuts to America \u2019 s wealthiest , given his family White House portfolios , stacked his cabinet with friends and donors with a combined net worth estimated to be worth over $ 4bn , and overseen an administration that some historians argue is the most corrupt America has endured since the 1920s .\n\u201c All that is perfect terrain for a leftwing populist to pounce , \u201d said Michael Kazin , a professor of history at Georgetown University and the author of a book on American populism .\nIt is against this backdrop that Democrats are looking to a us-v-them style of politics redolent of the US agrarian revolts of the 1890s \u2013 the movement that spawned the word \u201c populism \u201d in the first place .\nThat was the era when an anti-elitist alliance of impoverished farmers , rail workers and union members briefly formed the Populist party , which called for an end to monopolies , a progressive income tax and government ownership of the railroads , telegraph services and post office .\nAfter briefly threatening to upend America \u2019 s two-party system , the Populist party collapsed after selecting the Democratic nominee for president , William Jennings Bryan , who lost in 1896 . But the movement has been credited with giving rise to a progressive era in Democratic politics that culminated in Franklin D Roosevelt \u2019 s 1930s New Deal .\nThe meaning of populism has evolved considerably since then , and scholars today generally accept populism can be deployed by capitalists as well as socialists . Rightwing populists came to the fore in American politics in the mid-2oth century with figures such as the segregationist governor of Alabama , George Wallace , and the Republican anti-communist senator Joseph McCarthy .\nWhat populists across the spectrum have in common is a claim to serve the popular will of ordinary people in their quest to overcome powerful , self-serving elites . Kazin , who edits the leftwing magazine Dissent , said there has long been a rich seam of opposition to entrenched elites in American politics that \u201c has always been there to be tapped \u201d by politicians of all stripes .\nSurges in populist rhetoric tend to be prompted by perceived political and economic crises . Kazin argues the current populist wave leads back to the 2008 financial crisis , which has framed American political discourse for more than a decade .\nHowever , Kazin said he could not remember a presidential primary when so many prominent Democrats were running on a leftwing populist agenda \u2013 or a presidential contest , as 2020 may turn out to be , when both the Democrat and Republican are nominees are populists . \u201c You \u2019 re probably not going to have a leading candidate this year \u2013 except , perhaps , Joe Biden \u2013 who is not going to be talking in pretty strongly populist terms , \u201d he said .\nThat may be an exaggeration . In addition to Biden , who has not announced his presidential campaign , moderate senators such as Cory Booker , Amy Klobuchar and Kirsten Gillibrand have held back from populism .\nOthers , meanwhile , are probably stretching the definition . When Kamala Harris launched her campaign in Oakland in January , an aide to the California senator told New York magazine she was claiming the mantle of \u201c a new populism \u201d .\nHer campaign slogan \u2013 \u201c for the people \u201d \u2013 is a nod to her career as San Francisco district attorney , but also a classically populist term . Yet while her speech referred to \u201c the people \u201d 15 times , it contained none of the sharp condemnation of elites that is also a hallmark of populist discourse . On the contrary , Harris made a point of stressing \u201c our United States of America is not about us versus them \u201d .\nEven Barack Obama once toyed with the populist label . Reflecting on some of his leftwing policies , Obama openly mused on the idea that he might be a populist , but hedged : \u201c Maybe somebody can pull up in a dictionary quickly the phrase \u2018 populism \u2019 . \u201d\nHad anyone bothered to do so they might have discovered the word is routinely misused .

Many supporters of leftwing radicals such as the UK \u2019 s Jeremy Corbyn or France \u2019 s Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon balk at the populist label , which they argue tarnishes their candidates by association .\nIn the US , there is perhaps better understanding of the idea that populism can be a political language used by the right or left . But the word has also lost some of its meaning as it increasingly becomes a shorthand for economic redistribution . As a result , no candidate is more routinely referred to as populist than Sanders , but others include Warren and \u2013 until he dropped of the race \u2013 the Ohio senator Sherrod Brown .\nBrown , one of the few politicians to embrace the populist label , dedicated a page on his campaign website to explaining \u201c what populism is \u2013 and what it isn \u2019 t \u201d . The page argued that populism \u201c doesn \u2019 t fan resentments and exploit grievances \u201d , a claim that might be disputed by scholars of leftwing populists such as Hugo Ch\u00e1vez \u2013 or even the original American populists , like Jennings Bryan .\nSixteen Democrats have so far formally declared bids for the presidency , and another dozen are criss-crossing the early caucus and primary states to test the waters .
