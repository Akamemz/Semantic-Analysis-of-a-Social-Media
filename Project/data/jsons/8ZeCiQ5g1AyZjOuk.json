Rosa DeLauro , chair of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor , Health and Human Services , and Education , said in a statement that ICE officials coming into shelter to fingerprint teens is `` antithetical '' to ORR 's mission , and that she did not buy ICE 's justification `` for one second . ''\n`` Make no mistake : ICE \u2019 s intention is to intimidate and scare children by entering these shelters , and if HHS allows ICE to do so , they will be complicit , '' she said .\nDeLauro added that if the policy was actually about protecting children , `` it would not have gone into effect without notifying Congress or been leaked out anonymously . ''\n`` I will leverage every resource I have as Chair of the House Appropriations Subcommittee that funds HHS to ensure this policy is overturned and ORR upholds its mission to protect children , not enforce the racist immigration policies of President Trump and Stephen Miller , '' she added .\nHHS officials on Thursday said that their focus is always the safety and interest of the child and the agency verify the sponsor \u2019 s identity before sending them to the sponsor .\n\u201c As part of ORR \u2019 s determination of whether an individual is an appropriate sponsor , case managers are required to verify a potential sponsor \u2019 s identity and relationship to a child before releasing a child to a sponsor , \u201d the agency said in a statement .\nSponsors , they added , must provide documentation on their addresses , and once the children are released , they are no longer in the care of the government .\n\u201c Sponsors are responsible for making appropriate custodial decisions while unaccompanied alien children await their immigration hearings , \u201d the agency said .\nThe Washington Post reported in December that senior White House officials pushed to have ICE agents within ORR facilities . Instead , the administration opted to allow ICE to collect fingerprints of those who seek to pick up immigrant children at government shelters .\nImmigrant advocates said that they had already heard of ICE officials showing up at the ORR facilities to begin the process of fingerprinting children .\n\u201c It causes an incredible amount of stress \u2014 the kids were seeing it as scary and frustrating , \u201d said Jennifer Podkul , director for policy and advocacy at Kids In Need of Defense , a group that represents unaccompanied children .
