    "content": "Republicans are hoping that an overhaul of their election data program made before the 2016 election will help carry the party through an uncertain midterm .\nWhile the party is expected to benefit from a favorable Senate map , the GOP will be forced to fight a tough battle to keep control of the House . A president \u2019 s party historically loses House seats in the first midterm after a presidential election , a trend that could be compounded for Republicans if Trump \u2019 s controversies and Republican legislative woes continue into 2018 .\nBut the Republican National Committee is confident that its revamped voter data , which it sees as a major factor in Trump \u2019 s ability to expand the presidential map in 2016 , will pay dividends once again in the midterms .\nAfter a string of internal projection successes over the past two cycles , \u201c we are pretty confident that we know what the electorate is going to do , \u201d RNC senior adviser Katie Walsh told \u2588\u2588\u2588 in an interview .\n\u201c We have the foot to the gas on this and we will keep moving forward to make sure that in \u2019 18 , we run a better program than we did in \u2019 16 . And in \u2019 20 , we run a better program than in \u2019 18 , \u201d Walsh said .\nIn 2012 , stinging from another defeat at the hands of former President Obama , then-RNC chairman Reince Priebus put $ 100 million into restructuring of the party \u2019 s data and digital forces with the goal of never getting outgunned again .\nNational party voter data categorizes voters according to a variety of metrics meant to help predict whom the voter will choose in an upcoming election and what issues will resonate with that voter . That data is distributed across the party , informing decisions like which doors to knock and what issues to prioritize while targeting a persuadable voter .\nThe data allowed the RNC to stay in contact with both the Trump campaign and Senate campaigns to tell each camp which voters should be targeted with what messages to maximize turnout , a vital tool in a year where Senate candidates weren \u2019 t always looking for the same coalition of voters that delivered Trump the presidency .\nAfter Trump \u2019 s win , party officials were quick to point to the data program as a key part of the strategy . At the time , a top RNC aide claimed in an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 that while internal projections had Trump slightly behind going into the final weekend , he was put over the top thanks in part to the RNC \u2019 s success at turning voter data into turnout at the ballot box .\nThe RNC says it predicted national presidential voter turnout in 2016 within just 700,000 votes , out of the more than 136 million votes cast . The RNC also claims its prediction came within 0.2 percent of turnout in Montana \u2019 s recent special election , while predictions of each candidates \u2019 vote share were less than one percent off of the final result .\nThose results give the RNC the confidence that future projections will allow them to make smart spending decisions to win close elections .\n\u201c [ The data ] team is able to tell us down to a specific voter , identify people moving away from us and decide what message we can deliver to them to have an effect , \u201d said Juston Johnson , the RNC \u2019 s political director , in a recent interview .\nCampaign data expert and journalist Sasha Issenberg told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that it \u2019 s hard to judge the success of a party \u2019 s data operations . But Issensberg has found that Republican campaign operations were more satisfied with the data coming out of their party than Democrats were with the Democratic National Committee .\nThe tight margin of victory in 2016 also muddies the waters , according to Issenberg , the author of \u201c The Victory Lab : The Secret Science of Winning Campaigns . \u201d\nIf fewer than 100,000 voters had voted differently and backed Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonGiuliani consulted with Manafort on Ukraine info : report California political donor indicted for 2 overdose deaths at his home Sanders heart procedures shines spotlight on age of top Democrats MORE instead , Trump would have lost \u2014 a result that , while vastly different from what happened , may not have fallen outside of an accurate projection model .\n\u201c The question is , how much , despite Trump \u2019 s victory and the apparent top-level success about the RNC \u2019 s data in the campaign \u2026 trickles down to a state legislative caucus , to a gubernatorial election in another state , to other races ? \u201d Issenberg said .\nThe 2018 midterm cycle will be a new test for the RNC \u2019 s data program .\nTrump won \u2019 t be on the ballot as his party faces adverse historical trends on Election Day . Only twice since 1938 has the president \u2019 s party won more House seats than it lost in a post-presidential race midterm \u2014 once in 1998 , during the impeachment of President Clinton , and again in 2002 , following the 9/11 attacks .\nThe GOP \u2019 s situation could be even more dire than usual , thanks to Trump \u2019 s low favorability rating and the ongoing investigation into allegations that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia .\nThose factors could create a tough midterm environment for Republicans , but the party is buoyed by a favorable map in the Senate that includes Democratic incumbents running for reelection in 10 states Trump carried in 2016 .\nDemocrats have so far failed to win any of the coveted House special elections of 2016 , but they \u2019 ve slashed the 2016 margins in districts in Kansas and Montana , boosting Democratic hopes that an anti-Trump wave could be materializing .\nThe RNC aides said that the shrinking GOP margins in states like Montana , where Democratic Sen.
