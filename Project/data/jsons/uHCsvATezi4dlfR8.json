The main outcome of the deal between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping is that the United States wo n't escalate the trade war on January 1 , the date when tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese imports were set to increase to 25 percent from 10 percent . Instead , those tariffs will remain in place but at the current , lower rate .\nThat 's surely good news , and it 's the first indication since the U.S.\u2013China trade war began in July that the two countries both want to reach a truce .\nStill , describing this as an agreement\u2014or even , indeed , as a truce\u2014is probably giving it too much credit . Trump and Xi have agreed to avoid further escalation , but there is nothing in the read-outs provided by each nation that indicates a move towards reducing the current tariffs that have caused significant economic pain by raising prices for American manufacturers and by reducing American markets for Chinese exporters .\nTake , for example , what the White House is holding up as a major part of the deal : that China `` will agree to purchase a not yet agreed upon , but very substantial , amount of agricultural , energy , industrial , and other product [ s ] from the United States to reduce the trade imbalance between our two countries . ''\nThat 's vague and rather unenforceable language . It also shows that Trump continues to be fixed on the so-called `` trade deficit '' \u2014which has increased since his Chinese tariffs were imposed in July and sits at a record $ 300 billion over the first nine months of the year . It 's unlikely that a one-time boost in purchasing American exports will change that , and it 's not at all clear that China will be able to pressure domestic businesses into making those purchases while the tariffs it erected against American farm products are still in place .\nFor a look at what else the two sides have agreed to , check out this handy side-by-side from Bloomberg reporter Peter Martin .\nConfused about what exactly Xi and Trump promised each other yesterday ?
