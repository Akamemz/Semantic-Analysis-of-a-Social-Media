    "content": "( CNN ) Donald Trump insisted to a packed audience in Florida Wednesday that the campaign has `` never been so well united . ''\nBut behind the scenes , an all-out war between the party establishment and conservative base is breaking out -- in the halls of Congress , the fight for control of the Senate and in battleground states -- all threatening the GOP 's chances of winning this fall .\nConservative insurgents in key Senate races are throwing their full-fledged support behind Donald Trump , hoping to foment anger at incumbent Republicans worried that embracing the controversial nominee too tightly could alienate swing voters .\nAcross the Capitol , a bloc of outspoken conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus is furious at the party leadership after the surprising ouster this week of a leader of the group , Kansas Rep. Tim Huelskamp , at the hands of a moderate candidate backed by well-funded groups linked to the party establishment . Conservatives are already plotting retribution , with some privately warning that House Speaker Paul Ryan could face a revolt from the right .\n`` Clearly the war continues , '' Huelskamp told CNN Wednesday . `` The establishment never sleeps . They spend more time going after conservatives than going after Hillary Clinton . It was about sending a message , and the message is this : 'They came after me to get a scalp . ' ''\nAnd GOP leaders are irritated at Trump for picking what they believe was an unnecessary fight with two prominent Republicans -- Ryan and Sen. John McCain -- just as the party was trying to train its focus on Clinton .\n`` If he wastes time settling scores , or responding to what he thinks to be criticism , then you 're just wasting an opportunity to deliver a message , '' said Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma , an ally of Ryan 's . `` Do n't waste your time commenting on the Republicans . ''\nThe ill-will between the base and the leadership has been growing since the rise of the tea party in 2010 , culminating with the nomination of Trump on the backs of voters who feel betrayed by party leaders . And in the 2016 campaign , primary challengers in key Senate battlegrounds are seeking to align themselves with Trump in order to attack GOP incumbents who are struggling to support the GOP nominee 's brand of Republicanism .\n`` What we are seeing here is the Trump wave , '' said Kelli Ward , a former state senator seeking to overtake McCain in the state 's primary later this month . `` The tsunami of anti-Trump sentiment is now crashing over so many people who have been in Washington for way too long . ''\nYet vulnerable Republicans in tough reelection races are finding new ways to distance themselves from Trump , including Colorado Rep. Mike Coffman , who released an ad Thursday saying of Trump , `` I do n't care for him much . ''\nLong-shot primary challengers across the country are trying to latch onto Trump 's appeal with the right . In Wisconsin , businessman Paul Nehlen has been sharply critical of Ryan , accusing him of undermining the party 's nominee by his repeated criticisms . In Florida , businessman Carlos Beruff says he 'll pump millions behind an ad questioning Sen. Marco Rubio 's loyalty to Trump .\nAnd in Arizona , Ward says she 's actively lobbying for a Trump endorsement -- even going so far as urging Jeff DeWit , the Arizona chairman of Trump 's campaign , to `` put in the good word '' for her to win the nominee 's backing .\n`` I think I can be very , very helpful to Mr. Trump 's campaign as well , '' Ward said . `` He needs those kinds of surrogates and people who have been fighting for him . ''\nMcCain , who was unavailable for an interview Wednesday , supports Trump because he won the Republican nomination , including carrying Arizona with nearly 50 % of the vote in the March primary . But in the aftermath of McCain 's scathing rebuke of Trump for his battle with a Gold Star family of Muslim faith , the GOP nominee issued a stunning rebuke of the veteran Arizona senator and refused to endorse him in his primary .\n`` Look at John McCain : He ca n't get himself to vigorously support Trump , '' Ward said . `` He just ca n't do it . ''\nWard 's strategy is similar to Beruff 's , the businessman in Florida who is trying to mount an upset against Rubio , who dropped out of the presidential nominating contest after losing his home state to Trump in March .\nBeruff said he is investing `` a couple million '' dollars behind an ad promoting his support of Trump .\n`` Why does Marco Rubio refuse to support Donald Trump ?
