    "content": "Ballistic missiles may be able to carry nukes , defense intelligence assessment says\nN.Korea has not fully developed nuclear capabilities mentioned in report , Pentagon says\nA missile was raised to an upright firing position , then lowered\nThe Pentagon 's intelligence arm has assessed with `` moderate confidence '' that North Korea has the ability to deliver a nuclear weapon with a ballistic missile , though the reliability is believed to be `` low . ''\nDisclosed first by a congressman at a hearing on Thursday and then confirmed to CNN by the Defense Department , the assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency is the clearest acknowledgment yet by the United States about potential advances in North Korea 's nuclear program .\nThe surprise development comes amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula .\nNorth Korea has unleashed a torrent of dramatic threats against the United States and South Korea in recent weeks , including that of a possible nuclear strike .\nThe Obama administration calculates a test launch of mobile ballistic missiles could come at any time . But a senior administration official said there is no indication that missiles believed being readied for tests have been armed with any nuclear material .\nPentagon spokesman George Little said later Thursday , `` It would be inaccurate to suggest that the North Korean regime has fully tested , developed , or demonstrated the kinds of nuclear capabilities referenced in the passage '' of the DIA study .\nThat stance was echoed by James R. Clapper , director of U.S. national intelligence , who said the statement read by Rep. Doug Lamborn `` is not an intelligence community assessment . Moreover , North Korea has not yet demonstrated the full range of capabilities necessary for a nuclear armed missile . ''\nLamborn , R-Colorado , read from a declassified version of the DIA assessment at a House Armed Services Committee hearing .\n`` DIA assess with moderate confidence the North currently has nuclear weapons capable of delivery by ballistic missiles , however , the reliability will be low .

''\nIt is was not clear whether other U.S. intelligence agencies , such as the CIA , agree with the defense analysis .\nThe U.S. intelligence about North Korea revealed Thursday was `` mistakenly '' marked as declassified , according to an administration and a defense source .\nBut Lamborn told CNN 's `` AC360 '' he acted properly , reciting declassified information .\n`` Whether it was a mistake or not , I ca n't answer that , '' Lamborn said of the information release . `` Given the seriousness of the threat , this is something that I think people do need to know about .

''\nThe United States wants Beijing to `` stop the money trail into North Korea '' and to carry a strong message to the North that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is China 's goal , said the official and a senior State Department official .\nThe latest move by the North could signify that a much-feared launch is less imminent .

Japan has deployed defense systems .\nMike Rogers , chairman of the House Intelligence Committee , told CNN on Thursday that Kim is using rhetoric to solidify his base within his country and its military .\n`` North Korea is one of those countries that 's an army with a country , not a country with an army , '' said Rogers .\nLife is generally continuing as normal in the region , however , despite the North 's barrage of recent threats , which have included warnings to foreigners on the peninsula about their safety in the event of conflict .\nSouth Koreans , who have experienced decades of North Korean rage and posturing -- and occasional localized attacks -- have gone about their daily business without alarm .\n`` South Korea has been living under such threats from the past , and we are always prepared for it , '' South Korean Unification Minister Ryoo Kihl-jae told CNN Wednesday . He called the current climate `` a very ordinary situation . ''\nThe difficulties at the Kaesong industrial zone , a key symbol of inter-Korean cooperation , are among the few tangible signs of the tensions .\nPyongyang repeated a threat to permanently close the industrial zone , which it jointly operates with the South , accusing South Korean President Park Geun-hye of putting the manufacturing complex at risk .\nThe South Korean government , meanwhile , urged Pyongyang to work to resolve the situation through dialogue .\n`` Pyongyang should come to the bargaining table immediately , '' Ryoo said .\nNorth Korea has pulled its more than 50,000 workers out of the complex , which is on the northern side of the heavily fortified border that divides the two Koreas , and blocked personnel and supply trucks from entering it from South Korea .\nIn a statement reported Thursday by state-run media , the North Korean government said that what happens at the complex in the coming days `` entirely depends on the attitude of the South Korean authorities . ''\nThe dangers posed by North Korea came up Thursday at a separate House Intelligence Committee hearing about worldwide threats .\nClapper said the United States believes the primary objective of Kim 's bellicose rhetoric is to `` consolidate and affirm his power '' and to show he is `` in control of North Korea . ''\nClapper said he does n't think Kim `` has much of an endgame '' other than to get recognition from the world as a nuclear power which `` entitles him to negotiation , accommodation and , presumably , aid . ''\nBut in a statement for the record before the committee , Clapper reiterated that the nation 's `` nuclear weapons and missile programs pose a serious threat to the United States and to the security environment in East Asia . ''\nSince December , North Korea has put a satellite in orbit atop a long-range rocket ; conducted a nuclear bomb test , its third since 2006 ; and claimed to be prepared for pre-emptive nuclear attacks on the United States , though most analysts believe it does not yet have that capability .\nIts most recent nuclear test , in February , resulted in tougher U.N. sanctions , which infuriated Pyongyang , prompting it to sharpen its threats .\nAnnual military exercises in South Korea by U.S. and South Korean troops , which often upset the North , have added to the tensions , especially when the United States drew attention to shows of strength such as a practice mission by B-2 stealth bombers .",
