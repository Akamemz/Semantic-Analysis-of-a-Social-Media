''\nOne of the first diplomatic exchanges involved Cimavax , a lung cancer vaccine first developed in Cuba .

They \u2019 ve used it in pediatric brain cancer . We do n't have anything we can give to kids safely .

This is 1,000 pages the FDA needs to review .\nA trade mission [ last year ] allowed us to go down there and sign the agreements to move the documents forward .

But it 's actually more a treatment than what we typically think of as a vaccine . Can you explain exactly what Cimavax does ?\nKL : This vaccine has been developed by the Center for Molecular Immunology in Havana . They 've been developing it since the late 1990s and have done a lot of interesting clinical trials , including a large phase 3 randomized controlled trial in 405 patients in Cuba .

Now it has been approved by the Cuban FDA for the treatment of lung cancer .\nThe vaccine is made out of a man-made protein that is called epidermal growth factor . This is a protein your body normally produces , and it helps support the growth of normal cells like skin cells . [ It can also help cancer cells grow . ] In those cells that become cancerous , this vaccine initiates an immune response against the epidermal growth factor protein , thus depleting an important thing the cancer needs to grow and survive . So the cancer can \u2019 t grow anymore .\nJB : Could this method be applied to vaccines for other types of cancers or used for cancer prevention ?\nKL : Our Cuban colleagues have not tested that , because they \u2019 re economically constrained . They 've only tested it in the No . 1 cancer burden in Cuba , lung cancer , and they have n't had the resources to do clinical trials in other types of cancer . [ We 'll study that . ]\nCan it be used in prevention ? We already know patients that have early-stage lung cancer can get their cancers removed . We also know many are smokers who have damaged their lungs all over the place and have pre-cancerous lesions all over their lungs . They have a very high risk of relapse with a second lung cancer . We think the real potential for this vaccine is we can reduce the risk of relapse in this patient population .\nOne can think even further : If we develop an algorithm to predict a person 's lung cancer risk , we could potentially vaccinate the very highest-risk cohorts to try to reduce their risk of lung cancer . That patient population is potentially in the millions , especially if you go worldwide .\nJB : How far are we away from this vaccine reaching the US ?\nKL : Cuba has done the phase-three studies [ the final preapproval phase studies to confirm safety and effectiveness ] , and there are other phase 3 studies going on internationally in lung cancer . But there has been no experience in the US because of embargo issues .\nSo we are predicting that the FDA is going to ask for a phase 1 study [ which will test the drug in healthy people to confirm it 's safe ] in the US , just to replicate the safety data that our Cuban colleagues already reported .
