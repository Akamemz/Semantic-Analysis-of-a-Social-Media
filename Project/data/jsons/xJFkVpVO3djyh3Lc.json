And at least one of the Moscow-linked trolls was focusing on Charlotte .\nThe internet campaign appeared designed to convince African Americans , who traditionally favor Democrat candidates , that it was not worth voting \u2013 at least not for Hillary Clinton . It was built on false messages such as \u201c HILLARY RECEIVED $ 20,000 DONATION FROM KKK FOR HER CAMPAIGN . \u201d\nIt is impossible to gauge the campaign \u2019 s precise impact . But in 2016 , African American voter turnout was 7 % lower than in 2012 , the largest such drop on record .

But when that controversy died down , many Charlotte residents not only began to realize the depth of the fakery , but grew determined to overcome its pernicious effects on the city \u2019 s fabric . Since then , civic engagement in Charlotte is up , activists say , and the city has changed for the better .\nA report released in October by the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee outlines how the Internet Research Agency ( IRA ) , a troll farm in St. Petersburg working \u201c at the direction of the Kremlin , \u201d showed \u201c an overwhelming operational emphasis on race \u201d in its posts on Facebook , Instagram , and YouTube .\nThe intended goal , it appears , was to demoralize and divide African American voters and to amplify racial tensions in U.S. society .\nDrawing on research by data science firm New Knowledge , the committee found that half of the IRA \u2019 s most popular Instagram accounts targeted African American issues and users ; the most popular , @ Blackstagram , attracted 300,000 followers . The IRA \u2019 s Facebook advertisements sought to stir emotions after police shootings of black victims , while Facebook pages such as \u201c Blacktivist \u201d garnered millions of \u201c likes , \u201d shares , and comments .\nOn IRA-created YouTube channels , from \u201c Black Matters US \u201d to \u201c Don \u2019 t Shoot , \u201d 96 % of the content focused on race and police brutality .\nAnd these social media accounts were not just fringe internet dross ; some of them attracted a lot of attention .\nIn Seattle , a team at the University of Washington had long studied Twitter conversations using the Black Lives Matter hashtag . When the social media giant last year released an archive of tweets it had identified as coming from the IRA , online disinformation researcher Kate Starbird described how the team discovered that those Russian accounts were at the heart of conversations in both left-leaning and right-leaning circles .\nCourtesy of Leo Stuart of the University of Washington 's Information School\nOne of the influential accounts posing as an African American activist supporting # BlackLivesMatter was @ Crystal1Johnson , who attracted more than 56,000 followers and 5.6 million likes over two years . When the protests erupted in Charlotte in September 2016 after a policeman killed Keith Lamont Scott , tweets from accounts now known to be linked to the IRA shot up , according to the Information Operations Archive , a searchable database on foreign information warfare .\n\u201c 9 y.o . Zianna Oliphant delivered an emotional testimony to the # Charlotte city council . I \u2019 m in tears ... , \u201d \u201c Crystal \u201d tweeted a week after the protests . Her profile located her in Richmond , Virginia , but she was neither in Richmond nor in tears . She was a figment of a Russian troll \u2019 s imagination .\nNor did the Russians call off their campaign after the U.S. presidential election . In fact , the Senate Committee report says , IRA-created posts appeared on the internet even more frequently after the poll . And last month Facebook took down a network of 50 Russia-linked Instagram accounts that it said were engaging in \u201c coordinated inauthentic behavior . \u201d\nFor some black activists , this is not their overriding concern . Donna Davis , for example , who organized Black Lives Matter protests in Tampa , Florida , downplays the importance of Russian social media messaging compared with the impact of down-home discrimination .\n\u201c Most African Americans would concern themselves with people here stateside who are conspiring to oppress and incarcerate and marginalize them , \u201d says Ms. Davis .\n\u201c Russian interference may not be a priority when the people next door are calling the police on you for barbecuing , \u201d she adds . \u201c The bigger fish to fry are on the next block , not across the ocean . \u201d\nThis is not the first time that Moscow has paid close attention to black Americans , whose cause the Soviet Union espoused as far back as the 1920s . Soviet children \u2019 s magazines would highlight stories about American racism , and civil rights leaders such as Langston Hughes were invited to visit the Soviet Union , says Meredith Roman , author of \u201c Opposing Jim Crow : African Americans and the Soviet Indictment of U.S. Racism , 1928-1937 . \u201d\nWhile some Soviet officials may have been genuinely committed to anti-racism , she says , the USSR \u2019 s motive was largely propagandistic , \u201c to expose just how false [ Americans \u2019 ] claims of freedom and democracy are . Because they \u2019 re trying to build a better future , a socialist future . \u201d\nVocal support from America \u2019 s communist archrival did little to help civil rights activists like Martin Luther King Jr. make their case to the American people . It was easy to brand some of their ideals , particularly those concerning broader human rights beyond the civil rights struggle , as communist-inspired .\nThe FBI , under the leadership of J. Edgar Hoover , devoted considerable time and resources to studying alleged links between King and the Communist Party USA , which was loyal to Moscow . Seeking to portray him as being under communist influence , the bureau infiltrated its agents into the civil rights movement ; King was also subjected to an FBI counterintelligence program to discredit and disrupt his work .\nProfessor Roman , a professor of history at The College at Brockport , State University of New York , suspects that the Kremlin has sought to learn from the FBI \u2019 s example .\n\u201c They \u2019 re not only drawing on this long history of studying American racism \u2026 for much more duplicitous and unsavory purposes , but they \u2019 re also students of the ways in which the FBI during the Cold War was also using counterintelligence measures against African American communities to sow resentment , division , and even violence , \u201d she says .\nIndeed , the Russian disinformation campaign has sown distrust so that even legitimate activists have found their real identity \u2013 and motives \u2013 being questioned .\n\u201c Black Twitter is very much aware of this manipulation that has happened , \u201d says Bret Schafer , a digital disinformation expert at the German Marshall Fund . \u201c Awareness of the problem is a good thing but it has a negative side effect . We don \u2019 t know what accounts now are fake or pretending to be Black Lives Matter . It has led to some name-calling and accusations . \u201d\nIt led to real-life confusion too on the streets of Charlotte where , in Theodore Smith \u2019 s words , \u201c the mental can become the physical \u201d as false social messaging seeps into the real world and sparks real events .\nPatrik Jonsson/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Greg Jackson , a rapper and chef , became an activist and community advocate in the wake of the 2016 Charlotte protests , some of which became violent . But changing Charlotte took rising above a Russian disinformation campaign that aimed to demoralize black voters .\nWhen Keith Lamont Scott was killed in 2016 , it was two years after Black Lives Matter grew into a national movement after Michael Brown was killed by a police officer in Ferguson , Missouri , and four years after it was created following Trayvon Martin \u2019 s death in 2012 at the hands of a vigilante .\nShortly before Mr. Scott \u2019 s death , Greg Jackson , a Brooklyn-born chef and rapper living in Charlotte , released a new single , \u201c Bang Bang. \u201d The song addressed police shootings , but also the conditions that breed violence . He saw it as a new expression of his budding activism .\nAngered by the shooting , Mr. Jackson marched to the police department with thousands of other protesters demanding to know the truth about how Scott had died . He fell into conversation with a police lieutenant and secured the officer \u2019 s agreement to meet formally with activists to discuss the situation .\nTo seal the deal , he shook the lieutenant \u2019 s hand . And that \u2019 s when he first realized that something was off , that the crowd \u2019 s mood was not just angry , but ugly . Mr. Jackson was booed . \u201c I can remember it to this day , being called a sell-out , \u201d he says .\nAt the time , he had no idea that Russian internet trolls might be trying to manipulate the mood in Charlotte . Yet as protests continued for four days , shutting down parts of the city , Mr. Jackson did begin to wonder about the tweets , videos , and social media messages inundating his mobile phone .\n\u201c The message was so negative . They weren \u2019 t talking about rightful anger , but hate , \u201d he recalls .\n\u201c It was easy to manipulate everyone by applying pressure \u2026 and antagonism , injecting different narratives and getting real action from it , \u201d says Mr. Jackson .\n\u201c So much of the messaging wanted to stop forward progress , overpower it , \u201d he adds . \u201c It is an agenda to cause separation . It \u2019 s the perfect way to separate people . If you can get one crew to hate the other crew , then chaos happens . \u201d\nJennifer Roberts , the progressive white mayor of Charlotte in 2016 , was confounded too .\nThough she had joined black activists in calling for more police transparency , she became a symbol of a corrupt system in the eyes of many black protesters .
