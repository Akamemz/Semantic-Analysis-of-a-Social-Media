Some think it 's been repealed by Congress , but , in fact , it 's still on track .\nThe poll also revealed that about half of the American public , 49 percent , say they do not have enough information about ObamaCare to understand how it will impact their own family .\nObama hailed the simplified forms as an example of how his team listened to criticism from consumer groups and made a fix at a news conference Tuesday .
