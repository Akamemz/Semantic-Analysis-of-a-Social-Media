We come back from adversity , \u201d Ms. Durkan says . \u201c But this one is going to test everyone \u2019 s will , and everybody \u2019 s mettle . \u201d\nAlong with Washington state Gov . Jay Inslee , and King County Executive Dow Constantine , she \u2019 s determined to rise above blame-game politics and \u201c speak in one voice as one government , \u201d as she said in a press conference March 11 .\n\u201c I love this city to my bones . This is so hard , \u201d she says . \u201c You know it \u2019 s going to have such deep , long-term consequences . \u201d\nTo Ms. Durkan , getting the local response right isn \u2019 t just about accountability . Seattle is where she grew up as one of eight children , where she sold linens at JCPenney , where she graduated from law school .\nTwo months ago , the United States \u2019 first case of COVID-19 was confirmed just north of Seattle . That discovery set the Emerald City into uncharted waters . The pandemic \u2019 s double whammy on public health and the economy has been akin to an earthquake , shaking Seattle \u2019 s foundations .\nSeattle Mayor Jenny Durkan , the granddaughter of an Irish Catholic immigrant , sits in her City Hall suite wearing a shamrock pin . It \u2019 s St. Patrick \u2019 s Day \u2013 but her office , and the city outside , is nearly empty .\nIt was Monday , March 2 , when Mayor Jenny Durkan took the call at her Seattle home . On the line was Harvard-trained epidemiologist Trevor Bedford , who had caught the mayor \u2019 s attention with an ominous tweet two days earlier about his Seattle lab \u2019 s tracking of the new coronavirus .\nDr. Bedford had connected the genetic dots between the first U.S. coronavirus case \u2013 a man who tested positive Jan. 20 after returning from Wuhan , China , to Snohomish County north of Seattle \u2013 and a teenager who tested positive in the same county on Feb. 28 . \u201c This strongly suggests that there has been cryptic transmission in Washington state for the past 6 weeks , \u201d tweeted Dr. Bedford .\nMs. Durkan urgently tracked down Dr. Bedford , who studies infectious diseases at Seattle \u2019 s Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center , to dig into his predictions . Why did they depart so starkly from what government health officials were reporting ?\n\u201c His modeling , frankly , was very different from what public health was telling me , \u201d Ms. Durkan recalls .\nAs the former U.S. attorney listened carefully to the evidence , the shocking revelations sank in .\n\u201c After talking with him , there was little doubt in my mind that the modeling was accurate , \u201d she recounts , a belief other top experts would confirm . \u201c We aren \u2019 t dealing with five cases . We are dealing with hundreds of cases , and our time to act was yesterday . \u201d\nShe sketched out the math in a chart on a piece of paper , one she has carried ever since . \u201c Over 70,000 cases , \u201d she thought , \u201c in six weeks . \u201d\nShe pauses . \u201c It was one of the most sobering moments of my entire life . \u201d\nThe next day , at 1:33 pm , Ms. Durkan signed a proclamation of civil emergency for Seattle \u2013 the blue-collar town where she \u2019 d grown up as one of eight children , where she \u2019 d sold linens at JCPenney and later graduated from law school . The city she loves .\nTwo weeks later , on St. Patrick \u2019 s Day , Ms. Durkan , the granddaughter of an Irish Catholic immigrant , sits virtually alone in her 7th floor office suite , wearing a shamrock pin . Sunshine glints off the nearby skyscrapers , the deserted streets , and , a few blocks away , the waters of Elliott Bay .\nThe lobby of City Hall , adorned with a huge , gold seal of Chief Seattle , is eerily empty . Her lone assistant apologetically requests that all the mayor \u2019 s visitors first wash their hands , and remain several feet apart from her .\nBut even at a distance , Ms. Durkan \u2019 s gregarious warmth , quick wit , and no-nonsense demeanor comes through .\nAnn Scott Tyson/The \u2588\u2588\u2588 Seattle \u2019 s normally bustling 4th Avenue , outside City Hall , is empty on March 17 , 2020 . Mayor Jenny Durkan signed a proclamation of civil emergency on March 3 amid the coronavirus crisis .\n\u201c Thanks for coming in , \u201d she greets this reporter , raising one hand and making a \u201c V \u201d with four fingers in a Vulcan salute , popularized by Spock in \u201c Star Trek. \u201d I bungle the return salute , which , perhaps aptly , means : Live long and prosper . \u201c It takes practice ! \u201d she says , flashing a smile .\nThe heaviness of the moment , though , is unmistakable , as Ms. Durkan presides over a city that has gone from boom to virus-inflicted bust virtually overnight . For the past decade , Seattle has been one of the fastest-growing cities in the country . But the double whammy of the pandemic on public health and the economy is akin to an earthquake , shaking the Emerald City \u2019 s foundations .\nAsked whether this is the biggest challenge of her career , Ms. Durkan doesn \u2019 t hesitate . \u201c No question about it , by a magnitude of several factors , \u201d she says . \u201c I don \u2019 t think that our country has dealt with a more impactful and complicated and widespread crisis in many generations . \u201d\nIn response , Ms. Durkan is relying not only on top scientists but also her own , well-honed political instincts to guide Seattle through today \u2019 s uncharted waters . The daughter of a legendary Washington state senator and lobbyist , she learned to stand her ground by tussling with her siblings . When she graduated from the University of Washington Law School in 1985 , she recalls her mother commenting : \u201c Finally , someone is going to pay you to argue. \u201d But she also learned the art of compromise and teamwork .\nOn the Sunday after Dr. Bedford briefed her , she huddled for two hours with Washington state Gov . Jay Inslee , King County Executive Dow Constantine , and other senior officials to ensure they were on the same page .\n\u201c Once we heard the science , I don \u2019 t think there was anyone in the room that didn \u2019 t feel the government had to make some significant steps to reduce public gatherings , \u201d she says . \u201c It \u2019 s not either-or . It \u2019 s really more of a dial , \u201d she says . \u201c You try the first step , and if that seems not to be working , you have to accelerate through the dial pretty quickly . \u201d\nOn March 11 , Ms. Durkan stepped before the cameras flanked by Governor Inslee , Mr. Constantine , and other officials to unveil that first step \u2013 a ban on gatherings of more than 250 people . But first , she set the stage . \u201c One of the most important things we can do , according to the World Health Organization , is to speak in one voice as one government , \u201d she said . After a crisp few words , she elbow-bumped with the governor , made the Vulcan salute , and stepped aside .\n\u201c This is something Mayor Jenny Durkan was born to do , \u201d says a longtime Seattle journalist who spoke on condition of anonymity . \u201c She \u2019 s good at centrist , Democratic government . \u201d\nThe Washington state team was determined , as Ms. Durkan said later , to rise above the pull of blame-game politics and \u201c fight the virus instead of each other. \u201d In contrast , a few days earlier , as Vice President Mike Pence visited the state to bring vital emergency aid , President Donald Trump referred to Governor Inslee as \u201c a snake \u201d for alleging the administration had not \u201c stuck to the science . \u201d\nRobust local leadership has emerged in part amid a weak federal government response , analysts say . There was \u201c a lack of strong leadership from the feds , \u201d says Ann Marie Kimball , professor emeritus of epidemiology at the University of Washington . Moreover , she says , \u201c all epidemics and pandemics are really local , so local officials are in the best position to tailor [ the response ] \u2026 and they speak with a voice we recognize . \u201d\nAmericans expressed more confidence in their state governments than in President Trump or the federal government in handling the coronavirus , according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released this week .\nCarrying her hand-sketched chart of future cases , Ms. Durkan has no time to waste on infighting . She knows Seattle and Washington are only about 11 days behind Italy \u2013 one of the world \u2019 s hardest-hit countries \u2013 on the steeply rising COVID-19 curve .\n\u201c Every time Italy takes a step because they have reached a crisis point , it sends a signal to us , \u201d Ms. Durkan says . \u201c We should take that step now . \u201d\nYet state and local resources only go so far . What is keeping her awake at night is the lack of protective equipment such as gloves , masks , and gowns for Washington \u2019 s first responders and medical personnel . Last Friday , she visited Seattle \u2019 s Harborview Medical Center , only to see medical workers reaching into almost empty bins of masks .\n\u201c If our workers get sick , our health care system fails , \u201d warns Ms. Durkan , who says she spent dozens of hours last weekend trying to help secure more protective equipment . Washington has already received some supplies from national reserves , but is awaiting approval to get another 180,000 masks and face shields and 65,000 respirators . Hospital surge capacity is also inadequate without federal help , she says .\nMore shelters for Seattle \u2019 s most vulnerable population , particularly some 11,000 people experiencing homelessness , are another critical need . And given the expectation hundreds of thousands of people will lose their jobs , \u201c we need something bigger than the New Deal to put money in the pockets of workers \u201d and supplement private , local , and state relief efforts , Ms. Durkan says . For example , Amazon executives pledged $ 5 million for small firms such as restaurants and food trucks in the vicinity of the company \u2019 s downtown Seattle headquarters .\nSeattle \u2019 s vibrant patchwork quilt of neighborhoods is suffering , she says , and she takes such losses personally . She remembers growing up during the \u201c Boeing bust \u201d of the 1970s , when the airplane maker cut more than 40,000 workers . In her friends \u2019 neighborhoods , \u201c there was empty house after empty house , and dandelions pushing up , \u201d she recalls .\n\u201c I love this city to my bones . This is so hard , \u201d she says . \u201c You know it \u2019 s going to have such deep , long-term consequences . \u201d\nBut Ms. Durkan also has a tough streak that Seattle needs right now . After college , she moved to an Alaskan fishing village and taught English for two years . Then she worked as a baggage handler and dues-paying Teamster to help her pay for law school .
