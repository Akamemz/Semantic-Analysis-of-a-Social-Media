    "content": "President Trump said Tuesday that his administration will weigh gun laws in the wake of the Las Vegas massacre , a move that advisers say would shock and disappoint core supporters like no other action of his presidency .\nMr. Trump was asked by reporters if the mass shooting at an outdoor concert that left at least 59 dead , plus the gunman , and nearly 530 injured \u2014 the worst in modern U.S. history \u2014 would prompt him to consider gun control legislation .\n\u201c We have a tragedy , \u201d Mr. Trump said at the White House . \u201c We \u2019 ll be talking about gun laws as time goes by . \u201d\nPressed by reporters later Tuesday , the president said of engaging in a gun control debate , \u201c At some point , perhaps that will come . But that \u2019 s not for now ; that \u2019 s for a later time . \u201d\nAsked whether he believed the gunman should have been allowed to own the high-powered arsenal , Mr. Trump said , \u201c We \u2019 ll talk about that on a later date . \u201d\nAs the president prepared to visit Las Vegas on Wednesday , investigators revealed that gunman Stephen Paddock wired $ 100,000 last week to an account in his girlfriend \u2019 s home country of the Philippines . They also said the 64-year-old retired accountant had doubled down on his expensive gambling habit in the weeks prior to the shooting .\nSEE ALSO : Las Vegas shooter sent $ 100K to girlfriend \u2019 s home country of Philippines before massacre\nGun control advocates seized on reports that Paddock had modified many of his assault-style rifles with a relatively inexpensive \u201c bump stock \u201d that allows the weapon to be fired at a much more rapid rate , essentially turning it into an automatic weapon . Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms Special Agent in Charge Jill Schneider told reporters Tuesday evening that such devices were attached to 12 of his weapons \u2014 far more than initially thought .\nSen. Dianne Feinstein , California Democrat , said the modification allows the shooter to fire 400 to 800 rounds per minute and that Paddock \u201c appears to have modified at least one of his weapons in this way. \u201d She said she is looking at ways \u201c to finally close this loophole . \u201d\n\u201c This is the least we should do in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history , \u201d she said . \u201c It should be our highest priority . \u201d\nOther Democrats had more ideas Tuesday , touting plans for legislation not tied to any known facts about the Las Vegas gunman or his actions .\nSen. Richard Blumenthal , Connecticut Democrat , said he will introduce a bill requiring that federal background checks be completed and potential purchasers cleared as legitimate before a gun can be purchased . Under current law , a seller can proceed with a gun sale if there is no disapproval within 72 hours .\n\u201c I will introduce a measure to close the loophole that lets a buyer walk away with a gun if the background check is not complete in 72 hrs , \u201d Mr. Blumenthal wrote on Twitter .\nFBI data for 2014 , cited by The Hill , said more than 2,500 prohibited people were able to buy guns that year under the practice , called \u201c default to proceed . \u201d\nIt wasn \u2019 t clear what gun laws Mr. Trump , who as a candidate was a stalwart defender of Second Amendment rights , has in mind . White House aides didn \u2019 t elaborate on the president \u2019 s plans .\nBut people close to Mr. Trump said any step by the White House toward gun control would alienate the president from his base permanently .\n\u201c Impossible , \u201d said former White House strategist Steve Bannon , who told Axios that such a move would \u201c be the end of everything . \u201d\nLongtime Trump confidant Roger Stone predicted , \u201c Base would go insane and he knows it . \u201d\nMr. Bannon said a gun control proposal from this White House would anger Trump supporters even more than the president \u2019 s pledge to accept amnesty for young illegal immigrants , a tentative deal he made with congressional Democratic leaders last month .\nMr. Trump was so outspoken in favor of Second Amendment rights during the campaign last year that some observers close to the issue speculated he might have been referring Tuesday to a renewed push for a nationwide \u201c conceal carry reciprocity \u201d law , which would allow a gun owner with a conceal-carry permit in one state to enjoy the same privileges in all states .\nThere is typically enormous media pressure on a president after a mass shooting in the U.S. to call for stricter gun control measures . In the 48 hours after the Las Vegas massacre , White House aides have been saying it \u2019 s not the appropriate time to discuss gun laws while families are suffering the raw emotions of loss and many gunshot victims are still recovering in hospitals . Mr. Trump \u2019 s talk-about-it-later response could have been simply a way of brushing aside a question he didn \u2019 t want to answer at that moment .\nWhen reporters also asked the president Tuesday about proposed legislation to loosen restrictions on gun silencers , a move opposed by gun control groups , Mr. Trump replied , \u201c We \u2019 ll talk about that later . \u201d\nThe National Rifle Association declined to comment Tuesday on any legislative response to the Las Vegas shooting .\nWith Republican majorities in the House and Senate , the chances of Congress approving stricter gun regulations is virtually nonexistent .\nHuman Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin , while renewing a call for action , cited a series of mass shootings that failed to prompt lawmakers to enact anything , including the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012 and the Orlando nightclub attack last year .\n\u201c We need leadership now , and we must continue to demand it until our lawmakers either hear us \u2014 or we have new lawmakers , \u201d Mr. Griffin said .\nLate-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel blasted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , Kentucky Republican , and House Speaker Paul D.
