The four people I recently spent the morning with at Solly \u2019 s Tavern in D.C. ( sans booze , don \u2019 t worry ) were not Trump haters . They were , however , Trump quitters .\nAll of them , at some point over the course of the last nine months , had left their posts within the current administration , having decided that they could better serve their country from outside the government than from within . They weren \u2019 t happy about quitting , either . They were civil servants who wanted to remain civil servants , who , except for one , had worked under presidents of both parties . They had disagreed with superiors over the years , they had been fearful of new regulations and wary of political appointees , but they stayed on because that \u2019 s the nature of career work in government . This was different .\nWhen they came together for this discussion two weeks ago , the rapport was instantaneous . The vibe was as convivial and familiar as a reunion , except for the fact that they had been strangers five minutes before . They hailed from different parts of the bureaucracy , they ranged widely in age and background , but they had undergone such similar mental calculations since Trump \u2019 s election . Would their friends at work feel betrayed by their quitting ? Would they be opening up their job to someone with views antithetical to their own ? Having spent most of their lives in back offices , did they really feel comfortable taking such a public stand ? Once we got into the interview proper , which has been edited and condensed for clarity , they were candid , funny and furious . They may not work for the government anymore , but they all still see themselves as public servants .\nAll right , Sharon , you were the first to flee . Let \u2019 s start with election night . What were you thinking ? What did it feel like ?\n[ 1 ] At DOJ , she helped advance progressive policies , like marriage equality .

So the day after the election , my wife and I decided that we needed to stay home and regroup as a family . As a same-sex couple in this country , we knew exactly what the stakes were . And for the first couple of days , I tried to will myself to a place where I could think : maybe Trump didn \u2019 t really mean a lot of it , maybe it was just for the ratings .
