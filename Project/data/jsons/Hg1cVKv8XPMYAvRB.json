He \u2019 s a master at using the media as a foil , mocking it as failing , inaccurate , and out of touch . To Trump , reporters are both a conduit and a prop . It \u2019 s no accident they were penned up on the floor of his rallies like zoo exhibits .\nFor mainstream media organizations , this treatment represents a threat and an opportunity . They \u2019 re under tremendous business stress as Facebook and Google take away their old advertising dollars . But Trump is a huge , important subject . He brings in a flood of clicks and viewers .
