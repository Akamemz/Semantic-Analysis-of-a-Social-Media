    "content": "At age 62 still as earnest as a college student , Edward R. O \u2019 Donnell left his music production company in the hands of associates to walk neighborhoods for Mr. Romney , driven by a growing panic that government debt is dragging the nation into bankruptcy . Like many here , \u201c I have never been involved in an election campaign before , \u201d he said . But , he added , \u201c I committed months ago to doing anything and everything I can to try to change that direction . \u201d\nThe outcome rides largely on which campaign succeeds in getting its supporters to the polls by pestering , begging , calling , offering early-voting instructions or Election Day buses and then pestering some more . It is a competition that has played out here with paid workers and volunteers in a strange universe of sleep deprivation , interminable door-to-door marches through cold rains , borrowed guest rooms and donated junk food .\nIn Cincinnati , the signs of the showdown are everywhere \u2014 not just from the campaigns , but also from a vast array of groups that have descended , knocking on the doors of residents so exhausted by all the knocks that one resident warded off more by posting an announcement on her front door that she had voted early and was , thank you very much , done .\nThe fight is bitter , with reports of yard signs stolen , run over and even set afire , political phone calls so endless that at least one man was answering his home telephone by barking \u201c Romney \u201d rather than hello , and tales of front-door confrontations ending in curse words or worse .\n\u201c There \u2019 s nothing coming in this house that has the word \u2018 Obama \u2019 on it , \u201d one man told Liz Ping , an Obama volunteer , when she appeared at a doorstep . After the two disagreed over who ought to be blamed for the nation \u2019 s debt , Ms. Ping , who is 61 and retired , was chased from the porch and down the driveway , she recalled .\nOne rejected Romney door knocker said , \u201c I just tell them , \u2018 You can run me out of here , but somebody will be back next week unless you vote . \u2019 \u201d\nPublicly , at least , strategists on both sides here claim the edge .\nThe Obama campaign \u2019 s extensive infrastructure is intended to include as many volunteers as possible without forcing them to drive long distances to take part , a senior campaign adviser said .\n\u201c The whole goal is to allow for everyone who wants to help us to go communicate to voters who are likely to vote for the president in every corner of the state , \u201d said the adviser , Aaron Pickrell . \u201c So that \u2019 s the purpose \u2014 it \u2019 s not to have muscle and show that we have a bunch of offices . \u201d\nThe Romney campaign was dismissive . \u201c There are places in the state where we don \u2019 t have bricks and mortar , \u201d said Scott Jennings , a public relations executive from Louisville , Ky. , who directs Romney field operations in Ohio . \u201c But I didn \u2019 t set out to build a campaign structure that had as its core function rent payments . I don \u2019 t need to pay rent to somebody to achieve my door-knocking goals . \u201d\nThe Obama campaign has been here so long that there has been time to decorate .\nOffices are equipped with streamers , cheery multicolored posters , piles of charging campaign cellphones labeled \u201c firing up \u201d and even the occasional goofy riddle taped to a wall . Inside an office in Forest Park , north of Cincinnati , a \u201c Let \u2019 s Move Corner \u201d provides jump ropes , Hula-Hoops and instructions for stretches ( \u201c Reach down to your grass roots \u201d ) near a well-stocked snack table that on a recent morning included enough Krispy Kreme doughnuts that Michelle Obama , had she seen them , surely would have cringed .\nBy now , though , no one is jumping rope . Or eating much .\nAny frivolity has been eclipsed in these final hours , overtaken by exhaustion , tension and an overriding focus on meeting this operation \u2019 s carefully monitored numerical goals for volunteers signed up , doors knocked on , voters met . \u201c Can I ask you to run a marathon for us in the last four days ? \u201d a young staff member in jeans earnestly beseeched a white-haired volunteer as he stepped into the Forest Park office .\nThe essential theory in Obamaland : In a world of cellphones and caller ID , a door knock from a neighbor who can say , for instance , what high school he went to around here will be far more effective at luring a voter to the polls than a call from a stranger in some faraway state .\nAnd so , for months , neighborhood teams have canvassed at houses they have now grown thoroughly familiar with \u2014 and some of which can expect three more inquiries on Tuesday alone , unless and until their occupants have voted .\nBefore then , these visits are intended , in part , to get Obama-leaning residents with histories as inconsistent voters to form a specific plan for voting this time , whether by pondering aloud what time of day they might go on Tuesday or by remembering to mail in the absentee ballot that records show they have requested .\n\u201c When do you want to go ahead and do it ? \u201d Irvin Carney , a 24-year-old volunteer , asked a woman at her front door on a recent evening after she said she favored Mr. Obama . \u201c Want to say you \u2019 ll do it early next week ? Monday ? How \u2019 re you going to get there ? \u201d\nThe Obama operation established itself here by 2008 , winning Ohio and , to the shock of local leaders in the county that surrounds this city , Hamilton , which had long favored Republican presidential candidates . Then it never left . At least one staff organizer stayed put , keeping a desk for a while in the cluttered county Democratic office . Some in the old network of volunteers remained too , occasionally summoned to work phone banks for Mr. Obama \u2019 s health care law or efforts to oppose Ohio legislation to limit early voting .\nBy October 2011 , some among the 2008 \u201c Neighborhood Team Leaders , \u201d top local volunteers like Michele Fisher , began holding monthly meetings for the re-election effort .\n\u201c It seemed early then , but we \u2019 ve been going ever since , \u201d said Ms. Fisher , 55 , an owner of bagel shops in the area . On Election Day , she will serve as director of one of this county \u2019 s scores of campaign staging locations \u2014 the volunteered living rooms , alcoves and basements where team captains responsible for polling places ( red ) , logistics ( white ) and canvassing ( blue ) will focus on getting people to vote .\nIf anything , the operation here looks similar to the one from 2008 , just more established , more polished .\nThe technology has grown elaborate : rather than using only old-fashioned printouts of addresses and maps in manila folders , some volunteers use smartphones to be directed to homes the campaign wishes to target and then send back results of their stops electronically . Campaign officials will not say how many paid staff members have flooded into Ohio by now , though they seem to be everywhere , and volunteers in Ohio number in the thousands \u2014 some from other states but mostly , volunteers here say , locals .\n\u201c We \u2019 re kicking their tails ! \u201d Mayor Mark L. Mallory of Cincinnati , an Obama supporter , said of the comparative ground games after emerging from a last-minute meeting with a small group of Obama volunteers . One reason for Mr. Mallory \u2019 s confidence about the Obama campaign \u2019 s efforts : his own father , William L. Mallory Sr. , a longtime former state lawmaker , got a call the other day from the campaign , which noted , accurately , that he had not yet voted early . It urged him to do so .\nStill , imperfections have emerged . Some volunteers sign up to appear for door-knocking shifts but \u201c flake \u201d when a Saturday afternoon arrives cold and wet . From time to time , the campaign has shown flashes of arrogance , at least one local Democratic leader says , not always giving enough attention to its supporters and volunteers . And some addresses on what should by now be a carefully culled list turn out not to be homes at all , like a shuttered industrial building the other night .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t feel like I \u2019 ve been overly effective , \u201d Skip Tate , 50 , said a little gloomily after volunteering for a long afternoon of climbing steps in a steep-hilled neighborhood . So few people answered their doors that Mr. Tate finally accosted a passer-by just to have someone \u2014 anyone \u2014 he could urge to vote .\nThe entire task of building this largely volunteer operation has changed since four years ago as the novelty of Mr. Obama \u2019 s first run has faded some . Caleb Faux , the executive director of the Hamilton County Democratic Party , said he had observed an increase among black volunteers , but a drop among some white liberals who helped Mr. Obama four years ago .\nAmong the pack of outside groups on both sides leading their own parallel campaigns here , unions say they have seen an increase in volunteers \u2014 passions driven more now perhaps by fury over Republican state leaders \u2019 recent efforts to reduce early voting hours and to limit collective bargaining rights . \u201c If Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan get elected , woe be to us ! \u201d Robert H. Baker , a transit union leader , told a room full of union members who gulped coffee as they prepared to head out into drizzle on a recent morning to knock on labor \u2019 s own list of doors .\nFor the Obama campaign itself , there is no shortage of volunteers now , people here insist , but the wild , rushing emotions of 2008 have been replaced for some with a sense of determination and seriousness .\n\u201c It was sort of like a giddy high school kind of thing , \u201d Ms. Fisher said of the first Obama election . \u201c You were so excited . It was just something new , that you were really going to make a change . And we did . And we \u2019 re going to keep it going . But I think a lot of people this time around , they definitely still want to see him stay , but their lives are a lot different now . \u201d\nMr. Romney \u2019 s Kenwood Victory Center , like the five others in metropolitan Cincinnati , is the antithesis of funky , the inverse of cool .\nIts phone bank workers often connect to empty houses when even advocacy groups let computers do the dialing , and find the actual humans their workers talk to . The neighborhood door-knockers record their successes and failures in pencil , when many others have long switched to smartphones tied wirelessly to databanks .\nBut neither advanced technology nor uber-organization nor a carpeting of campaign offices drive Mr. Romney \u2019 s campaign . Rather , it is people like Henry and Donna Peters , a stream of volunteers that swelled to a flood after Mr. Romney \u2019 s strong showing in last month \u2019 s presidential debates .\n\u201c For a 67- and 65-year-old to get out of bed every Saturday morning \u2014 and other mornings \u2014 you have to feel very strongly about supporting a man who can make changes , \u201d Mr. Peters said .\nHe and Ms. Peters were driving to Blue Ash , a northeast Cincinnati suburb , to target likely Republican voters . She held a clipboard stuffed with campaign handouts and sheets of addresses to visit .\nThe Peterses are the ideal next-door neighbors , soft-spoken people so courteous that they assiduously avoided stepping on the lawns of the homes they visited . But they had intensity : political newcomers , they regularly trek from Kentucky , a safe Romney state , in hopes of tipping Ohio into the Republican column . And they are not alone .\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you 're not a robot by clicking the box . Invalid email address . Please re-enter .

View all New York Times newsletters .\n\u201c We focus on quality , not quantity , \u201d said Alex Triantafilou , the Hamilton County Republican chairman .\nMr. Triantafilou and campaign officials insist that Mr. Romney has overcome Republicans \u2019 early ambivalence to become his party \u2019 s favorite , not just its nominee . \u201c No one I \u2019 m talking to is complaining we \u2019 ve got the wrong guy , \u201d he said .\nMaybe . In talks with grass-roots conservatives , Mr. Romney seems considerably less beloved than his opponent is despised . It is too late for conservatives to find a perfect candidate , George Brunemann , who is head of the Cincinnati Tea Party , said over a recent coffee . But \u201c Obama can get people as different as white supremacists and Black Panthers to walk in the same direction , \u201d he added .\nAt Kenwood this particular Friday , a wall of sign-up sheets held names of nearly 300 volunteers , local residents and loyalists from afar . Lloyd Kelley , a 72-year-old retired administrative law judge , came to Kenwood from St. Louis , on the heels of workers from California and Tennessee and Louisiana . At the Westwood center in western Cincinnati , Nancy Pennell , a stay-at-home mother from Greenville , S.C. , who came on impulse , was knocking on doors with volunteers from Kentucky and California .\nAnd there are flashes of over-the-top ardor , the sort suggesting that a campaign feels it is gaining the edge .\nAt a long table , Luke and Moriah Swanger , ages 10 and 11 , worked the phones after finishing their home-schooling . \u201c They don \u2019 t like what \u2019 s going on with the economy , \u201d said their father , Kraig , \u201c and I said , \u2018 If you don \u2019 t like it , then do something about it . \u2019 \u201d\nMr. Triantafilou said he had seen internal surveys that give Mr. Romney \u2019 s supporters a wide edge in enthusiasm over Mr. Obama \u2019 s . \u201c We didn \u2019 t have it in \u2019 08 . We didn \u2019 t have it in \u2019 06 ; we got creamed , \u201d he said . \u201c But we \u2019 ve got it back . \u201d\nFor both the Romney and Obama campaigns , this is the culmination of a long winnowing of the voter rolls , a political gold-panning of Hamilton County \u2019 s 800,000 residents and 347,000 households that washes away the unconvertible until only the nuggets \u2014 the persuadable and the committed \u2014 remain .\nHere , the harvest of new information from data-mining , polls , focus groups and telephone and door-to-door surveys culls those households where an appeal for support would be wasted .\n\u201c The point is to try to build yourself a get-out-the-vote list in which , if everyone on the list voted , you \u2019 d win the election , \u201d said Mr. Jennings , the Ohio field operations director .\nNow , with the end in sight , the time for persuasion has passed . The volunteers \u2019 single goal is to ensure that every known Romney supporter votes .\nMost join an army of foot soldiers who have slogged the northeast suburbs since early summer . By last Wednesday , the campaign had knocked on doors 151,887 times in Hamilton County \u2014 an imposing figure , but deceptive , as many knocks went unanswered and many households were covered more than once .\n\u201c This is the first time in many cycles that the Republican presidential campaign has emphasized door-knocking over phone banks , \u201d Mr. Jennings said . Across Ohio , he said , Mr. Romney \u2019 s campaign is knocking on 19 times as many doors as Senator John McCain \u2019 s campaign did four years ago .\nIn large part , of course , that is because Mr. McCain \u2019 s Ohio campaign was starved for money . But it also reflects reality : land lines are being replaced by cellphones that canvassers can not reach , and those landlines that remain are so overwhelmed that owners have become deadened to appeals .\n\u201c Look , everybody in Ohio with a phone and a pair of scissors is going to figure it out sooner or later , \u201d Mr. Jennings said . \u201c They \u2019 re being bombarded . Everyone in Ohio has a robo-dialer . \u201d\nIndeed , as of six days before the election , Mr. Romney \u2019 s telephone banks had made 397,741 calls in Hamilton County alone , albeit far fewer were successfully completed .\nConsider a recent evening at the Kenwood center , where Mr. Kelley punched buttons on a telephone linked to a computer database of numbers of likely Republican voters .\nThe second call went better : \u201c I \u2019 m calling to remind you and your husband to vote in this election , \u201d Mr. Kelley said , then exclaimed \u201c Great ! \u201d when his target pledged to back Mr. Romney .\nThe third call reached an answering machine . Nobody answered the fourth . The fifth , sixth and seventh reached more answering machines .\n\u201c This is the fifth phone bank I \u2019 ve worked on , \u201d he said later . \u201c I \u2019 d say that out of 10 people , on average , four aren \u2019 t at home , one is undecided , three are Romney and one \u2019 s Obama . \u201d\nIt is the most expensive and technically sophisticated campaign in American history . But in the end , after months of work , after hundreds of hours of commercials and hundreds of thousands of front-porch visits and millions of telephone calls \u2014 after focus groups , fliers , yard signs and rallies \u2014 Shelley and Dennis Russell are unmoved .\nDays before the polls open they are still undecideds , targets in the cross hairs of a yearlong political cannonade who somehow , miraculously have yet to be persuaded by either side .\nYet on closer inspection , it is no miracle . To the contrary , they personify the angst that defines the dying days of this especially bitter contest , an emotion that the campaigns have longed to capitalize on , but have never captured .\nThe Russells live with their three children in a white clapboard house in Blue Ash , in middle-class east Cincinnati . She is a payroll supervisor ; he works for a towing company . Their oldest son , 18 , heads to boot camp next February because military service will pay for a college education that his family can not afford .\nTheir pay is steady , but even low inflation has eaten away their income . They wonder openly whether the system is broken . They say they doubt either candidate can fix it .\nMr. Obama , they say , is honest and has good ideas , but no spine to carry them out . \u201c Obama says he \u2019 s going to put more out for education , \u201d said Mr. Russell , who wants to improve his skills but lacks money for more schooling . \u201c But like his medical plan , I highly doubt that what comes out the other end is going to be what went in .\n\u201c If you \u2019 re willing as a leader to say , I \u2019 ll get 100 percent \u2014 oh , I \u2019 ll take 60 \u2014 you \u2019 re not accomplishing what you set out to do . Do you really believe he \u2019 s going to do it in next four years ? \u201d\nMr. Romney might run the country better , they say , but he is clueless about the average person \u2019 s needs . Witness , Ms. Russell said , his comments about the 47 percent of Americans who pay no taxes or depend on government handouts . \u201c Me personally , I \u2019 ve never been on public assistance , \u201d she said . \u201c But I definitely have friends who are single mothers who could not go to work without it .\n\u201c To me , it shows he \u2019 s in a different wage bracket than the rest of us , \u201d she said .\nMr. Russell scoffed at Mr. Romney \u2019 s suggestion that children should borrow from their parents to pay college tuition instead of seeking government loans . It is a notion , he said , that only someone with wealthy parents would propose .\nThen again , Ms. Russell said : \u201c I don \u2019 t know that that will make him worse than Obama \u2014 that he can do enough good that it will trickle down to us . \u201d\nThe Russells concede that their indecision is not for lack of information . Like virtually every family in Ohio , they have watched the debates , talked with friends and read the material hung on their doorknobs , although they have drawn the line at listening to robo-calls . In short , they have been drenched by a fire hose of creative persuasion of the quality and volume that only two billion-dollar campaigns could muster .\nStill , Ms. Russell mused , it is not altogether clear what this monumental ground game has added up to .\n\u201c I think this is one of those races that could go either way , \u201d she said . \u201c They both have enough money backing them .\n\u201c If they \u2019 d put some of that money to work instead , it \u2019 d be amazing . \u201d",

Or eating much.\n\nAny frivolity has been eclipsed in these final hours, overtaken by exhaustion, tension and an overriding focus on meeting this operation\u2019s carefully monitored numerical goals for volunteers signed up, doors knocked on, voters met. \u201cCan I ask you to run a marathon for us in the last four days?\u201d a young staff member in jeans earnestly beseeched a white-haired volunteer as he stepped into the Forest Park office.\n\nThe essential theory in Obamaland: In a world of cellphones and caller ID, a door knock from a neighbor who can say, for instance, what high school he went to around here will be far more effective at luring a voter to the polls than a call from a stranger in some faraway state.\n\nAnd so, for months, neighborhood teams have canvassed at houses they have now grown thoroughly familiar with \u2014 and some of which can expect three more inquiries on Tuesday alone, unless and until their occupants have voted.\n\nBefore then, these visits are intended, in part, to get Obama-leaning residents with histories as inconsistent voters to form a specific plan for voting this time, whether by pondering aloud what time of day they might go on Tuesday or by remembering to mail in the absentee ballot that records show they have requested.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cWhen do you want to go ahead and do it?\u201d Irvin Carney, a 24-year-old volunteer, asked a woman at her front door on a recent evening after she said she favored Mr. Obama. \u201cWant to say you\u2019ll do it early next week?

It was just something new, that you were really going to make a change. And we did. And we\u2019re going to keep it going. But I think a lot of people this time around, they definitely still want to see him stay, but their lives are a lot different now.\u201d\n\nThe Challenger\u2019s Effort\n\nMr. Romney\u2019s Kenwood Victory Center, like the five others in metropolitan Cincinnati, is the antithesis of funky, the inverse of cool.\n\nIts phone bank workers often connect to empty houses when even advocacy groups let computers do the dialing, and find the actual humans their workers talk to. The neighborhood door-knockers record their successes and failures in pencil, when many others have long switched to smartphones tied wirelessly to databanks.\n\nBut neither advanced technology nor uber-organization nor a carpeting of campaign offices drive Mr. Romney\u2019s campaign. Rather, it is people like Henry and Donna Peters, a stream of volunteers that swelled to a flood after Mr. Romney\u2019s strong showing in last month\u2019s presidential debates.\n\nVideo\n\n\u201cFor a 67- and 65-year-old to get out of bed every Saturday morning \u2014 and other mornings \u2014 you have to feel very strongly about supporting a man who can make changes,\u201d Mr. Peters said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe and Ms. Peters were driving to Blue Ash, a northeast Cincinnati suburb, to target likely Republican voters. She held a clipboard stuffed with campaign handouts and sheets of addresses to visit.\n\nThe Peterses are the ideal next-door neighbors, soft-spoken people so courteous that they assiduously avoided stepping on the lawns of the homes they visited. But they had intensity: political newcomers, they regularly trek from Kentucky, a safe Romney state, in hopes of tipping Ohio into the Republican column. And they are not alone.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

In talks with grass-roots conservatives, Mr. Romney seems considerably less beloved than his opponent is despised. It is too late for conservatives to find a perfect candidate, George Brunemann, who is head of the Cincinnati Tea Party, said over a recent coffee. But \u201cObama can get people as different as white supremacists and Black Panthers to walk in the same direction,\u201d he added.\n\nAt Kenwood this particular Friday, a wall of sign-up sheets held names of nearly 300 volunteers, local residents and loyalists from afar. Lloyd Kelley, a 72-year-old retired administrative law judge, came to Kenwood from St. Louis, on the heels of workers from California and Tennessee and Louisiana. At the Westwood center in western Cincinnati, Nancy Pennell, a stay-at-home mother from Greenville, S.C., who came on impulse, was knocking on doors with volunteers from Kentucky and California.\n\nAnd there are flashes of over-the-top ardor, the sort suggesting that a campaign feels it is gaining the edge.\n\nAt a long table, Luke and Moriah Swanger, ages 10 and 11, worked the phones after finishing their home-schooling. \u201cThey don\u2019t like what\u2019s going on with the economy,\u201d said their father, Kraig, \u201cand I said, \u2018If you don\u2019t like it, then do something about it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Triantafilou said he had seen internal surveys that give Mr. Romney\u2019s supporters a wide edge in enthusiasm over Mr. Obama\u2019s. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have it in \u201908. We didn\u2019t have it in \u201906; we got creamed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got it back.\u201d\n\nFor both the Romney and Obama campaigns, this is the culmination of a long winnowing of the voter rolls, a political gold-panning of Hamilton County\u2019s 800,000 residents and 347,000 households that washes away the unconvertible until only the nuggets \u2014 the persuadable and the committed \u2014 remain.\n\nHere, the harvest of new information from data-mining, polls, focus groups and telephone and door-to-door surveys culls those households where an appeal for support would be wasted.\n\n\u201cThe point is to try to build yourself a get-out-the-vote list in which, if everyone on the list voted, you\u2019d win the election,\u201d said Mr. Jennings, the Ohio field operations director.\n\nNow, with the end in sight, the time for persuasion has passed. The volunteers\u2019 single goal is to ensure that every known Romney supporter votes.\n\nMost join an army of foot soldiers who have slogged the northeast suburbs since early summer. By last Wednesday, the campaign had knocked on doors 151,887 times in Hamilton County \u2014 an imposing figure, but deceptive, as many knocks went unanswered and many households were covered more than once.\n\nThousands more were to be blitzed before Election Day.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time in many cycles that the Republican presidential campaign has emphasized door-knocking over phone banks,\u201d Mr. Jennings said. Across Ohio, he said, Mr. Romney\u2019s campaign is knocking on 19 times as many doors as Senator John McCain\u2019s campaign did four years ago.\n\nIn large part, of course, that is because Mr. McCain\u2019s Ohio campaign was starved for money. But it also reflects reality: land lines are being replaced by cellphones that canvassers cannot reach, and those landlines that remain are so overwhelmed that owners have become deadened to appeals.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cLook, everybody in Ohio with a phone and a pair of scissors is going to figure it out sooner or later,\u201d Mr. Jennings said. \u201cThey\u2019re being bombarded. Everyone in Ohio has a robo-dialer.\u201d\n\nIndeed, as of six days before the election, Mr. Romney\u2019s telephone banks had made 397,741 calls in Hamilton County alone, albeit far fewer were successfully completed.\n\nConsider a recent evening at the Kenwood center, where Mr. Kelley punched buttons on a telephone linked to a computer database of numbers of likely Republican voters.\n\n\u201cIs this Mr. Weaver?\u201d he asked.\n\nThe person on the other end immediately hung up.\n\nThe second call went better: \u201cI\u2019m calling to remind you and your husband to vote in this election,\u201d Mr. Kelley said, then exclaimed \u201cGreat!\u201d when his target pledged to back Mr. Romney.\n\nThe third call reached an answering machine. Nobody answered the fourth. The fifth, sixth and seventh reached more answering machines.\n\n\u201cThis is the fifth phone bank I\u2019ve worked on,\u201d he said later. \u201cI\u2019d say that out of 10 people, on average, four aren\u2019t at home, one is undecided, three are Romney and one\u2019s Obama.\u201d\n\nThe Targets\n\nIt is the most expensive and technically sophisticated campaign in American history. But in the end, after months of work, after hundreds of hours of commercials and hundreds of thousands of front-porch visits and millions of telephone calls \u2014 after focus groups, fliers, yard signs and rallies \u2014 Shelley and Dennis Russell are unmoved.\n\nDays before the polls open they are still undecideds, targets in the cross hairs of a yearlong political cannonade who somehow, miraculously have yet to be persuaded by either side.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nYet on closer inspection, it is no miracle. To the contrary, they personify the angst that defines the dying days of this especially bitter contest, an emotion that the campaigns have longed to capitalize on, but have never captured.\n\nThe Russells live with their three children in a white clapboard house in Blue Ash, in middle-class east Cincinnati. She is a payroll supervisor; he works for a towing company. Their oldest son, 18, heads to boot camp next February because military service will pay for a college education that his family cannot afford.\n\nTheir pay is steady, but even low inflation has eaten away their income. They wonder openly whether the system is broken. They say they doubt either candidate can fix it.\n\nMr. Obama, they say, is honest and has good ideas, but no spine to carry them out. \u201cObama says he\u2019s going to put more out for education,\u201d said Mr. Russell, who wants to improve his skills but lacks money for more schooling. \u201cBut like his medical plan, I highly doubt that what comes out the other end is going to be what went in.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re willing as a leader to say, I\u2019ll get 100 percent \u2014 oh, I\u2019ll take 60 \u2014 you\u2019re not accomplishing what you set out to do. Do you really believe he\u2019s going to do it in next four years?\u201d\n\nMr. Romney might run the country better, they say, but he is clueless about the average person\u2019s needs. Witness, Ms. Russell said, his comments about the 47 percent of Americans who pay no taxes or depend on government handouts. \u201cMe personally, I\u2019ve never been on public assistance,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I definitely have friends who are single mothers who could not go to work without it.\n\n\u201cTo me, it shows he\u2019s in a different wage bracket than the rest of us,\u201d she said.\n\nMr. Russell scoffed at Mr. Romney\u2019s suggestion that children should borrow from their parents to pay college tuition instead of seeking government loans. It is a notion, he said, that only someone with wealthy parents would propose.\n\nThen again, Ms. Russell said: \u201cI don\u2019t know that that will make him worse than Obama \u2014 that he can do enough good that it will trickle down to us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Russells concede that their indecision is not for lack of information. Like virtually every family in Ohio, they have watched the debates, talked with friends and read the material hung on their doorknobs, although they have drawn the line at listening to robo-calls. In short, they have been drenched by a fire hose of creative persuasion of the quality and volume that only two billion-dollar campaigns could muster.\n\nStill, Ms. Russell mused, it is not altogether clear what this monumental ground game has added up to.\n\n\u201cI think this is one of those races that could go either way,\u201d she said. \u201cThey both have enough money backing them.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019d put some of that money to work instead, it\u2019d be amazing.\u201d",
