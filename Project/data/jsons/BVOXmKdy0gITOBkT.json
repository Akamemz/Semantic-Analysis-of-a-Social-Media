Whether when a vaccine for the novel coronavirus is released or \u2014 heaven help us \u2014 well before then , new infections will slow and life will move back toward normal . Then it will be time to sue each other .\nSalus populi suprema lex esto , wrote the Roman jurist Cicero : `` The health [ or welfare or common good ] of the people should be the supreme law . '' But in the United States our literal supreme law is the Constitution , and the public health measures taken to curb the spread of COVID-19 are running into constitutional rights questions at every turn . Here are some of the cases that coronavirus could conceivably send to the Supreme Court .\nThe First Amendment protects our freedoms of religion , speech , press , assembly , and petition , and at least two of those could easily be the subject of post-pandemic lawsuits . The most obvious candidate is assembly , as a growing number of cities and states have issued some version of a stay-at-home order , putting police power behind the federal recommendation against gatherings of 10 or more .\nCases whose appeal potentially could go all the way to the top are already happening . In New Jersey , parents who hosted a party of several dozen people were charged with child endangerment . And in New Mexico , the president of the Albuquerque Tea Party has filed suit in federal court against Gov . Michelle Lujan Grisham ( D ) , alleging her shelter-in-place order violates his right to free assembly and worship by prohibiting social and religious gatherings . The question for the Supreme Court would be whether that claim is correct , whether the state interest behind the shelter-in-place order is compelling enough to override First Amendment guarantees .\nThat brings us to the other probable type of First Amendment case , which would concern limits on free exercise of religion . While most churches and other places of worship have suspended in-person services , some \u2014 including a few megachurches which host crowds of thousands \u2014 have refused to close their doors . One recent survey of regular churchgoers found one in 10 reporting their churches are open .\nA Florida pastor was arrested Monday for continuing live services and slapped with misdemeanor charges of unlawful assembly and violation of a public health emergency order . If convicted , he could be jailed for up to 60 days . It `` looks like we 're going to have to go to court over this because the church is encroached from every side , '' the pastor said in a video on Facebook . If the assembly restrictions specifically targeted religious gatherings , he 'd have a strong case . As it is , they 're content-neutral and will likely survive court challenge absent some novel argument .\nGuns and ammo ranked almost as high as toilet paper on some Americans ' prep lists , but firearms sales were suspended in Los Angeles , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , and Washington state . New Orleans has an emergency proclamation which would permit the mayor to close gun shops , though that has n't happened yet .\nPennsylvania 's governor let gun sales resume at the urging of justices from the state 's supreme court , and New Jersey 's governor did the same Monday following multiple suits from gun rights groups . Other legal challenges are underway and could ultimately ask SCOTUS to settle whether the Second Amendment makes weapons sales an essential service .\nCivil libertarians like me have warned about lasting curtailment of personal freedoms stemming from the pandemic response , and the Fourth Amendment 's guarantee of privacy is among the rights at risk . Officials are using cellphone location data to track population movement , and , as my colleague Navneet Alang has noted , that 's unlikely to be the only privacy violation proposed as a means of fighting the pandemic .\nMeasures implemented in Israel , China , and South Korea include facial recognition software , CCTV monitoring , tracking of credit card purchases , and more . If governments in America attempt something similar , expect lawsuits . The ACLU is already on alert , even scrutinizing online learning apps which could violate students ' privacy . The court here would be tasked with considering whether such encroachments on privacy breach the Fourth Amendment 's mandate of specific warrants authorizing searches of our `` persons , houses , papers , and effects , '' and , if so , whether the state interest in public health permits that breach .\nThe Trump administration 's push to effectively suspend habeas corpus seems to have been stymied by congressional Democrats , but other violations of the Fifth , Sixth , Seventh , and Eighth Amendments , which protect our trial rights , are possible . Court closures could run afoul of the right to a speedy trial \u2014 Pennsylvania 's top court , for example , has declared a statewide judicial emergency through mid-April \u2014 and the Justice Department 's interest in video hearings raises questions about whether a video conference can be considered a public trial . Suspension of jury trials is a potential battle here , too . In each scenario , the Supreme Court would consider whether modifications to constitutionally-determined trial procedure were justified by the state interest in limiting the spread of infection .\nMeanwhile , the risk of pandemic within jail and prison facilities has drawn attention to longstanding criminal justice reform issues , including needless pre-trial detention and inhumane conditions with insufficient medical care or hygiene products . Emergency policy changes \u2014 most notably large-scale release of pre-trial detainees who were held only because they could n't afford bail \u2014 might fuel court challenges to the pre-pandemic status quo .\nAlabama , Iowa , Ohio , Oklahoma , and Texas all attempted to include abortion in the medical procedures temporarily suspended to conserve resources for treatment of COVID-19 .
