The tweet drew a warning from Twitter for Trump 's rhetoric , with the social media giant saying he had \u201c violated the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence. \u201d ( Twitter via AP )\nThis image from the Twitter account of President Donald Trump shows a tweet he posted on Friday , May 29 , 2020 , after protesters in Minneapolis torched a police station , capping three days of violent protests over the death of George Floyd , who pleaded for air as a white police officer knelt on his neck . The tweet drew a warning from Twitter for Trump 's rhetoric , with the social media giant saying he had \u201c violated the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence. \u201d ( Twitter via AP )\nTwitter escalated tensions with President Donald Trump on Friday , adding a warning to one of his tweets for the first time and saying he violated the platform \u2019 s rules by glorifying violence when he suggested protesters in Minneapolis could be shot .\nTrump has been railing against the company since earlier this week , when it for the first time applied fact checks to two of his tweets . Those were about mail-in ballots .\nThe flap comes at a fraught moment for Twitter and social media more generally . Debate is heating up about when and how much these companies should police the content on their platforms as coronavirus misinformation swirls and the 2020 U.S. presidential election looms .\nFor Trump , the feud with Twitter serves as a convenient distraction from major challenges he faces heading into November , such as controlling a pandemic and dealing with soaring unemployment .\nThe Trump tweet that was flagged Friday came amid days of violent protests over the death of George Floyd , a handcuffed black man who pleaded for air as a white police officer kneeled on his neck .\n\u201c These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd , and I won \u2019 t let that happen , \u201d Trump tweeted about the protesters . \u201c Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way . Any difficulty and we will assume control but , when the looting starts , the shooting starts . Thank you ! \u201d\nThe comment evoked the civil-rights era by borrowing a phrase used in 1967 by Miami \u2019 s police chief to warn of an aggressive police response to unrest in black neighborhoods .\nTwitter did not remove the tweet , saying it had determined it might be in the public interest to have it remain accessible . But the tweet was hidden so that a user looking at Trump \u2019 s timeline would have to click on the warning to see the original tweet . Hiding it also effectively demotes the tweet by limiting how users can retweet it and ensuring that Twitter algorithms don \u2019 t recommend it .\nTwitter said Friday it posted the warning label on Trump \u2019 s tweet \u201c based on the historical context of the last line , its connection to violence , and the risk it could inspire similar actions today , \u201d but left it up \u201c given its relevance to ongoing matters of public importance . \u201d\nA tweet using the same language as Trump \u2019 s was later posted on the official White House Twitter account , and Twitter eventually put a warning on that too . It was also posted on Facebook , which hasn \u2019 t taken any visible action on it .\nTwitter taking a harder line than Facebook on Trump \u2019 s posts likely has something to do with Twitter \u2019 s decision last year to stop taking political ads , said Melissa Ryan , CEO of consultancy group Card Strategies , which researches online disinformation and right-wing extremism .\nShe said the coronavirus pandemic has also led Twitter to inch toward stronger enforcement of its policies at the same time that Trump \u2019 s tweets have \u201c amped up in terms of crazy and intensity and disinformation . \u201d\n\u201c Twitter and Trump have been playing a game of chicken , \u201d Ryan said . \u201c It feels like they \u2019 ve both been moving toward this for a while . \u201d\nTrump took to Twitter to complain , calling multiple times for the revocation of Section 230 , part of a 1996 law overhauling telecommunications . That section generally protects social media platforms from liability for material users post on their platforms . Trump on Thursday signed an executive order challenging those protections .\nThe order directs executive branch agencies to ask independent rule-making agencies including the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission to study whether they can place new regulations on the companies , though experts express doubts much can be done without an act of Congress .\nThe president and fellow conservatives have claimed for years that Silicon Valley tech companies are biased against them . But there is no evidence for this , and while the executives and many employees of Twitter , Facebook and Google may lean liberal , the companies have stressed they have no business interest in favoring one political party over the other .\nTwitter first outlined in early 2018 that it wouldn \u2019 t block world leaders from the platform or remove their controversial tweets . But it announced nearly a year ago that it could apply warning labels and obscure the tweets of world leaders if they used their accounts to threaten or abuse others . That followed complaints from Trump critics that the president has gotten a free pass from Twitter to post hateful messages and attack his enemies in ways they say could lead to violence .\nTwitter further clarified its rules in October , saying it will enforce its policies against any user who makes clear and direct threats of violence against a person , but carving out an exception for government officials \u2019 \u201c foreign policy saber-rattling on economic or military issues . \u201d\nThe earlier tweets that Twitter flagged were not hidden but did come with an option to \u201c get the facts about mail-in ballots , \u201d a link that led to fact checks and news stories by media organizations .
