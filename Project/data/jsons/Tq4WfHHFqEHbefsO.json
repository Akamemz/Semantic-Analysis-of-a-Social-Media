    "content": "In the past week , The New York Times has ridiculed Gov . Andrew Cuomo and Gov . Chris Christie for having `` fed panic '' by ordering quarantines for health workers arriving from Ebola-plagued countries .\nNBC News ' Brian Williams opened his broadcast last Friday announcing that the Obama administration was trying `` to restrain the Ebola panic . ''\nMSNBC 's Rachel Maddow complained that the `` hysteria '' over Ebola was getting `` stupider . ''\nI have n't noticed any panic . If you want panic , review media coverage of the police shooting in Ferguson , Missouri . That hair-on-fire coverage was based entirely , it turns out , on the media 's gullibly swallowing inaccurate accounts of the incident .\nFor decades liberals have terrified soccer moms about a slew of imaginary terrors : global warming , Alar on apples , breast implants , heterosexual AIDS , nuclear war , and Republicans taking away their birth control .\nNannies rushed to grade schools to yank apples out of little children 's hands , elderly married couples got tested for AIDS , and students at Ivy League colleges demanded that their health departments stock cyanide pills in case of nuclear attack . ( Because the Russkies were definitely hitting Ithaca , New York , and Providence , Rhode Island , first . )\nAnd then , except for a few heterosexual AIDS victims -- who also happened to be intravenous drug users -- no American ever died from a single one of these liberal-hyped dangers . I do not recall , for example , ever hearing of a nurse acquiring AIDS from treating an AIDS patient , certainly not a nurse wearing a spacesuit , as the Ebola-infected nurses were .\nWithin the past few years , Rachel Maddow has been panicked about ( among many , many other things ) :\n-- Right-wing hillbillies murdering census workers ( the census worker committed suicide in an attempted insurance fraud ) ;\n-- Republican budget cuts killing us when bridges collapse ( the Minnesota bridge collapsed because of a design flaw , not budget cuts ) ;\n-- Gun rights supporters plotting another Oklahoma City bombing ( they had assembled on April 19 , the anniversary of the bombing -- which also happens to be the anniversary of the battles of Lexington and Concord ) .\nBut now , the political party that specializes in hysteria has suddenly become too-cool-for-school about a deadly disease being brought to our country for no reason . Oh , you big pussy , you wo n't get Ebola .\nLet the record reflect , Democrats now oppose `` the politics of fear '' -- as NBC 's Chuck Todd dubbed concerns about Ebola .\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire accused her Republican opponent , Scott Brown , of `` fear-mongering '' about Ebola , but she sure did n't mind fear-mongering on health care . In order to pass the widely unpopular Obamacare , Shaheen carried on about insurance companies ' obscene profits and hectored , `` We can not wait ! ''\nThe New York Daily News ' Denis Hamill wrote five hysterical columns on Ferguson . One was titled , `` Is this Selma in 1965 ? '' But when it comes to a disease that kills more than half of the people it infects , he says , `` Take a chill pill . ''\nHow about telling the deranged protesters in Ferguson to `` take a chill pill '' ?\nAfter years of Republican candidates having to assure voters that it would require several million policemen to take away every woman 's birth control kit -- but that was an excellent question ! -- it 's too much to have to listen to liberals scoff at a disease with a 70 percent fatality rate .\nEbola is a lot more dangerous than any of the fears whipped up by liberals . Peter Piot , the Flemish scientist who discovered Ebola in 1976 , recently told the British Guardian :\n`` I always thought that Ebola , in comparison to AIDS or malaria , did n't present much of a problem because the outbreaks were always brief and local .
