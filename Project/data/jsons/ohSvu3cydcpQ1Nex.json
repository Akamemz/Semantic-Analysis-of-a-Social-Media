And so we will . \u201d\nThe problem for Trump and Pence is that Congress hasn \u2019 t shown the same desire for a Space Force \u2014 in fact , they actually voted down a legislative proposal to create it last November .\nBut the White House is now hopeful they will receive congressional approval for the new military branch in the fiscal year 2020 defense budget . That \u2019 s in part because of a seeming change of heart \u2014 or at least , a capitulation \u2014 from Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis .\nFor much of last year , top Pentagon leaders railed against the idea of a Space Force . \u201c The Pentagon is complicated enough , \u201d Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson told reporters last summer . \u201c This will make it more complex , add more boxes to the organization chart. \u201d Mattis himself even came out against it .\nNow , though , Mattis is at least somewhat supportive publicly of the idea . Which means it \u2019 s possible members of Congress may change their minds in Trump \u2019 s favor .\nExpect Trump and Pence \u2019 s greatest ally in Congress for a Space Force , Rep. Mike Rogers ( R-AL ) , to lead the way .\nRogers has said that creating the new branch is necessary for US national security , particularly because other countries are catching up to America \u2019 s power in space . \u201c Russia and China have become near peers , \u201d Rogers told NPR in June 2017 . \u201c They \u2019 re close to surpassing us . What we \u2019 re proposing would change that . \u201d\nHe \u2019 s since led the legislative effort to create the new military service . Rogers tweeted his approval during Pence \u2019 s remarks Thursday :\nI am thrilled about the news today . We in the House have been warning for years about the threats to our space assets and the unacceptably slow pace to develop more capable space systems . The report is a step in a multi-year process that will help ensure a safer , stronger America https : //t.co/12SwRkaz1c \u2014 Mike Rogers ( @ RepMikeRogersAL ) August 9 , 2018\nSo what happens now ? Well , in the short term , the Pentagon will do what it always does : makes changes in an extremely bureaucratic , wonky , and boring way .\nHere \u2019 s how the Pentagon will start creating a Space Force\nThe Pentagon released a report after Pence \u2019 s speech outlining four main things it will do to begin establishing a Space Force :\nCreate a new Space Command , which will serve as the main Pentagon hub for all things fighting in space\nEstablish the Space Operations Force , which will be made up of the military \u2019 s elite troops focusing on conflict in space\nCreate the Space Development Agency , which will help the Pentagon acquire weapons to fight in space\nEnsure there are the requisite leaders and support staff to manage the day-to-day operations of the Pentagon \u2019 s operations in space\nAll of that boils down to the Defense Department making bureaucratic changes to deal with space in the way Trump wants .\nThe biggest loser in all of this will be the Air Force , which already takes the military lead on defending American items in space \u2014 like the satellites that guide your GPS system \u2014 with an agency called the Air Force Space Command .\nIt \u2019 s unclear as of now , though , if that organization will go away or somehow fold under new Space Force .\nThat \u2019 s just one of the many , many questions I and others have about what a Space Force will actually look like . There is one important thing no one questions : that space has become much more dangerous in recent years .\nWhat was once the final frontier could soon become the front line of a future conflict .\n\u201c Space is no longer a peaceful domain , \u201d James said in an interview in July 2017 . \u201c There is a real possibility that a conflict on Earth could bleed into space . \u201d\nThere are two main reasons for that : Russia and China . According to the Defense Intelligence Agency , Russia wants to gain more power in space because it believes gaining supremacy there will allow it to win future fights on this planet . And in late 2015 , China created the Strategic Support Force , which is meant to streamline and improve its space , cyber , and electronic warfare missions .\nThe two countries are causing problems with anti-satellite technology , too , noted Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats in a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing last May \u2014 meaning they could mess with the satellites that help the US military do its job . The Pentagon is planning to open a space-war center to counter their threats .\nOkay , but , like ... what sort of conflict is actually going on in space ? What are we really talking about here ?\nBasically , there is tons of military equipment in space , especially satellites . This kind of equipment helps the US , Russia , and China \u2014 and any tech-savvy force \u2014 navigate terrain and communicate with one another .\nOn top of that , assets in space help to track enemy fighters , take pictures for intelligence services , and even help control missiles . Without space support , it would be much harder to fight on Earth ; that \u2019 s why Russia and China are investing so heavily in it .\nBut Russia and China aren \u2019 t space \u2019 s only threats . The area just outside Earth \u2019 s orbit has seen an explosion of commercial satellites and other communications equipment since the 1960s , put there first by countries and , as of late , by commercial companies . That equipment is used to help drivers reach their destination , help potential lovers swipe right ( or left ) on dating apps , or simply help people text a friend .\nThe chart below shows the huge growth in these satellites . The blue line represents their total growth since around 1960 .\nThe internet , of course , adds a new complication to all the equipment that countries are putting in space . Most notably , equipment can potentially be hacked . For instance , a team of hackers could jam a satellite by messing with its signals so it interrupts the satellite \u2019 s normal activity , rendering it useless . That could cause problems for all sorts of everyday activities , like credit card transactions and phone calls .\nThen , of course , there \u2019 s space debris threatening all of that commercial and military space equipment , since it could knock into the expensive machines . NASA estimates that there are 20,000 pieces of debris larger than a softball orbiting the Earth , about 500,000 pieces of debris the size of a marble or larger , and many millions of pieces that are too small to register .\nAll of this is why Trump , Rep. Rogers , and even former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld believe the US needs a Space Force . It would ensure the safety of space equipment by monitoring physical and cyberthreats against US communication and navigation assets . It would be more of a defensive mission than an offensive one \u2014 for now . That doesn \u2019 t mean actual troops in space yet . But down the line , who knows ?\nEssentially , if the US military wants to protect life here on Earth , it needs to safeguard US assets in space . But is a Space Force the way to do it ?\nThe main issue is that Rogers and others \u2014 and perhaps Trump himself \u2014 believe the Air Force isn \u2019 t paying enough attention to space . That makes sense to an extent , as the Air Force \u2019 s main directive is to focus on flying planes here on Earth .\nCreating a new service would ensure that there \u2019 s a segment of the military whose job is to focus on space 100 percent of the time . That would allow the Space Force to counter Russia , China , and other threats while giving space-focused staff more bureaucratic power inside the Pentagon .\nBut Sean O \u2019 Keefe , a former NASA leader and Navy secretary , thinks creating a brand new branch of the military is not the right way to go . \u201c This is a solution in search of a problem , \u201d he told me in an interview last summer . Basically , he thinks the Air Force is already doing a fine job protecting space \u2014 even if it does privilege earthbound pilots . Creating a Space Force would just add another layer of bureaucracy to an already massive organization : the Pentagon .\nJames , the former Air Force secretary , agrees . She thinks dealing with the current complaints about the Air Force and space \u2014 1 ) that it \u2019 s not well funded , 2 ) that acquisition takes too long , and 3 ) that there is no one person to call about military space operations \u2014 makes more sense .\nThe first complaint is already being mollified to an extent . The Air Force asked for a 20 percent increase in funds to focus on space in 2018 . As for the third complaint , James feels it \u2019 s a common refrain heard at DOD that doesn \u2019 t necessarily just apply to the Air Force and space . \u201c If you look at any warfare area in the Department of Defense , there \u2019 s no single bellybutton for anything , \u201d she told me .\nSo clearly the Space Force has its detractors \u2014 including the current Air Force secretary . And of course , Congress has yet to officially mandate its creation .\nBut with Trump \u2019 s endorsement , the conversation has kicked into high gear once again . Time will tell if future US troops will be wearing space helmets .",
