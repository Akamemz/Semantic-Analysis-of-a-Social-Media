Yes , it was a \u201c Groundhog Day \u201d debate Tuesday night at Longwood University . That \u2019 s where CBS anchor and debate moderator Elaine Quijano did her best Lester Holt impersonation ( or was it Candy Crowley or maybe CNBC ) \u2013 throwing hard questions mostly at Republican Gov . Mike Pence and allowing Sen. Tim Kaine to interrupt at will .\nQuijano turned left from the very first question \u2013 citing 1988 liberal , Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen \u2019 s comment about the responsibility of being vice president . She recalled that he said , \u201c if tragedy should occur , the vice president has to step in without any margin for error. \u201d That set the stage perfectly and signaled viewers that the debate was to be seen consistently from the left . And Quijano didn \u2019 t disappoint .\nBy a factor of 8-to-1 , Quijano peppered Pence with tough question after tough question . She reserved just one for Kaine .\nFor conservatives , it was like Groundhog Day . If viewers saw their shadow , that will mean slightly more than one month more of the most-biased media election in human history .\nBy a factor of 8-to-1 , Quijano peppered Pence with tough question after tough question . She reserved just one for Kaine .\nQuijano started out fine , asking Kaine how he , \u201c praised Secretary Clinton 's character , including her commitment to public service , yet 60 percent of voters do n't think she 's trustworthy .
