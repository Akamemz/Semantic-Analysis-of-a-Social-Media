You would think that if Trump actually was a racist he \u2019 d be demanding Dems do even worse - assuming that \u2019 s possible - but it \u2019 s all just a bogus distraction and making sense is not a consideration . It \u2019 s a lie to shut people up .\nWas anyone really shocked to learn that you can \u2019 t say that a manifest hellhole is a hellhole anymore , at least according to our moral betters in the media and politics ? You have some Democrat politician who represented his district for nearly four decades and if you point out that it \u2019 s a mess , the problem is the guy who says so out loud . Not the crime . Not the poverty . Not the rodent infestation . It \u2019 s Donald Trump , POTUS for 2.5 years , who is to blame for the real crime , which is pointing out what everyone knows .\nExcept Trump doesn \u2019 t play that . He calls out the elite and its inept members without fear and without apology . He speaks , if you \u2019 ll pardon the hackneyed expression , truth to power .\nIt \u2019 s called \u201c accountability , \u201d and it \u2019 s exactly what America needs from its ruling caste . Which is why it is exactly what the establishment wishes to put out of bounds . How dare Trump , and by extension you , be so uppity as to demand that our exalted betters not fail at everything they do !\nTrump , and you , are not allowed to demand results . You are not allowed to demand competence . You are not allowed to demand integrity . What you are allowed to do is sit there and take whatever garbage they hand you , without complaint , with gratitude even . You are not a citizen . You are a serf . At least , that \u2019 s what they want to convert you into - but neither you nor the avatar of your anger Donald Trump are going to accept that .\nThis is our country , and all their lies about \u201c racism \u201d and whatever other bogus bigotry they try to label you with are not going to shut us up .\nWhat \u2019 s amusing is how the criticism of Elijah Cummings \u2019 s little slice of Hades is only intolerable because Trump said it . They are free to . After the tweets slamming the Democrats \u2019 utter failure to serve the people of Baltimore , and the resulting backlash against people criticizing its useless government officials , conservative Twitter took great delight in finding and tweeting countless prior narrative-busting stories of Democrat corruption , rampaging rats and street crime in the lib media and even comments by the likes of Bernie Sanders . Everyone knows the sordid truth about Baltimore and the other Democrat-run big cities . In my own LA the homeless crowd the streets littering the sidewalks with syringes and dropping last night \u2019 s free meal whenever and wherever their hearts desire . We all see the truth , including the elite . They just want to prevent us from speaking it by branding it , falsely , as racism or some other -ism . They know it \u2019 s a lie . They hope that you \u2019 ll be intimidated anyway .\nThis demand that we forgo speaking inconvenient truths is a trend . We found out just a couple weeks ago that we aren \u2019 t supposed to demand immigrants not hate America and Americans . Again , there \u2019 s no debate about the truth of the statements themselves . Ilhan Omar hates America as much as she allegedly loves her brother . The elite knows it , and the elite knows you know it , yet the elite \u2019 s tactic is to try to neutralize it by keeping you from saying it . They seek to create a social sanction for criticizing them .\nIt \u2019 s Stalinist , which they would take as a compliment if they knew who Stalin was .\nShould we even bother noting that none of this applies when the liberals attack us ? Some anti-Christian creep who hates every principle in the Constitution shoots up a gun-free zone and that atrocity is somehow attributable to everyone who believes in the entire Bill of Rights , not just the rights that aren \u2019 t there . It \u2019 s the NRA \u2019 s fault , as is Baltimore \u2019 s crime wave , because ... because shut up and submit . It \u2019 s the same sinister strategy at work , the attempt to place what you and what at least half of America believes outside the bounds of acceptable discourse .\nThey don \u2019 t get to decide what truths may or may not be spoken .\nSee , this is our country , and we will hold corrupt and incompetent government employees accountable . We will call out the ungrateful and the anti-American . We will stand up for our right to keep and bear arms .\nYou progs will hate us for it , and you \u2019 ll lie about us , but why should we care ? You \u2019 ll do it anyway . Even if we were so inclined to submit , we could never submit enough . Even if you managed to eliminate all us kulak opponents - every leftist \u2019 s not so secret fantasy , as history and pinko Twitter blue checks \u2019 tweets demonstrate - you would still need our memory to provide a scapegoat for your inevitable failures .
