    "content": "Some suggest that Congress \u201c remove Trump from office , so that he can not abuse incumbency to subvert the electoral process , but let the American people make the judgment on whether or not he gets a second term\u2026 Removing Trump from office for the remainder of his term would disable him from abusing presidential power again and protect the integrity of the electoral process from inappropriate interference . At the same time , letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump , despite his attempt to subvert the system , should have another chance\u2026 Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus . As long as Trump can run again , Republicans can not hide behind a claim that they are [ the ] ones protecting voter choice by opposing impeachment. \u201d Edward B. Foley , Politico\n\u201c In his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky , what reason would Trump have for raising a discredited fever swamp conspiracy theory about Crowdstrike and the DNC server being stashed somewhere in Ukraine unless he actually believed this [ to ] be true and worth pursuing ? He had every reason to think this was a private call ; he wasn \u2019 t shaping public opinion , rallying his base , tossing a new shiny object in front of reporters to chase\u2026 \u201c It is not just President Trump \u2019 s lying that has set a whole new precedent . The \u2018 truths \u2019 he tells frighten me more . These are the things he clearly believes to be true despite all evidence to the contrary , whether it is who actually pays the price for tariffs , or whether a given public servant deserves to be prosecuted for treason\u2026 What Donald Trump \u2018 knows \u2019 derives from the seamy worlds of real estate , casinos and reality TV , and it is his infected worldview , paired with his distant acquaintance with actual truth , that is now the most frightening characteristic of this presidency. \u201d Nancy Gibbs , Time\n\u201c [ Pompeo ] is casting Democrats \u2019 request to talk to the people with potential knowledge of the Ukraine allegations as bullying . That fits neatly with Trump \u2019 s assessment that the entire impeachment inquiry is designed to target him . It also fits in Trump \u2019 s broader plan to blow off Congress at every opportunity . The U.S. attorney general , Trump \u2019 s former White House counsel and now the secretary of state are among the top officials who have refused to talk to Congress , even when subpoenaed . This is n't normal , and that 's to Congress 's detriment\u2026 The checks and balances are set up to work if both sides respect the governing norms . The founders just didn \u2019 t put tools in the Constitution for this\u2026 We know of one tool Congress still has , and it \u2019 s pretty blunt : inherent contempt \u2026 \u201c The fact that a centuries-old , somewhat crude enforcement tool is even being considered at the highest levels of Congress in 2019 underscores just how much the Trump administration \u2019 s disregard for the democratic process has kneecapped Congress \u2019 s ability to do anything to oversee the executive branch . They \u2019 re out of options except to create their own jail of sorts\u2026 And it \u2019 s safe to say Pompeo knows it. \u201d Amber Phillips , Washington Post\nRegarding the White House \u2019 s efforts to limit the inquiry , it \u2019 s worth noting that \u201c The termexecutive privilege , meaning the privilege to shield certain testimony and documents from disclosure to courts or congressional investigators , did not come into use until the Eisenhower administration ; Richard Nixon was the first and so far only president to assert such a privilege against a formal impeachment inquiry . That attempt , as we all know , ended badly in 1974\u2026 The Trump administration will likely continue fighting to preserve its privileges , real and imagined\u2026 If [ Congress ] needs testimony or documents , it should go to the high court immediately to enforce its demands . \u201d Garrett Epps , The Atlantic\nOthers , however , argue that \u201c To limit the impeachment process to the most blatant presidential misdeed yet discovered would leave in the dust \u2014 unresolved for history , setting dangerous precedents \u2014 the possibility of holding accountable a president who routinely enriches himself at the expense of the taxpayers and flouts the Constitution \u2019 s emoluments clause , lies so persistently that we \u2019 re far from the democratic concept of transparent government , usurps the role of Congress by unilaterally holding up funds or using them for other purposes than it has approved , bullies private businesses by threatening a tax increase or a significant raise in postal rates\u2026 \u201c For months this year we were told that \u2018 the public isn \u2019 t interested. \u2019 This assumption doesn \u2019 t allow for new developments or for individuals to see things in a different light . Within three days in the past tumultuous week , public opinion as measured in a Morning Consult poll [ went up by seven points ] in favor of an impeachment process\u2026 If the articles of impeachment are carefully and thoughtfully drawn , if they indicate the comprehensiveness of Mr. Trump \u2019 s disregard for the Constitution , it would be unwise to rule out anything. \u201d Elizabeth Drew , New York Times\n\u201c All of the defects Trump \u2019 s critics see in the president \u2019 s character \u2014 his venal transactionalism , his mob-esque worldview , his lack of concern for the national interest , his own pseudo-authoritarian instincts \u2014 are on display in the Ukraine call , and it paints a damning indictment of a man unfit for the country \u2019 s highest office\u2026 despite the new developments\u2026 the scandal remains straightforward . \u201d Zack Beauchamp , Vox\nMany argue that \u201c a key to winning any trial is to tell the simple story and force the other side to tell a more complicated one\u2026 The news Monday afternoon that Trump asked the Australian prime minister for help with the Justice Department \u2019 s review of the origins of the Russia investigation , and that Attorney General William Barr traveled overseas to ask foreign leaders for similar aid , will undoubtedly lead to discussion of widening the impeachment inquiry . That would be unwise , because those episodes are problematic for different reasons than the Ukraine episode\u2026 \u201c The question House Democrats should aim to answer is whether Trump \u2019 s actions [ with Ukraine ] are a type of abuse of power that our nation \u2019 s founders intended to address via impeachment . While it is self-evident that Trump \u2019 s scheme is highly problematic , Democrats \u2019 impeachment inquiry will fail unless they can convince the public that it warrants removal from office . Moving forward , Democrats need to make that case to the American people without letting distractions or roadblocks created by Trump and his team distract them or pull them off course. \u201d Renato Mariotti , Politico\nThe right is opposed to impeachment , arguing that Trump \u2019 s actions do not merit removal and that it would be unnecessarily divisive .\nThe right is opposed to impeachment , arguing that Trump \u2019 s actions do not merit removal and that it would be unnecessarily divisive .\n\u201c Democrats have had an impeachment itch that they \u2019 ve been desperate to scratch ever since Donald Trump took office . For them , Ukraine is equal parts a genuine outrage and an excuse , the release valve for nearly three years of fear and loathing\u2026 \u200d \u201c Presidential-level diplomacy always involves horse-trading , and this , surely , is not the first time a president has prodded an ally to do him a favor in his political interest . The risk of Trump \u2019 s heavy-handed request \u2014 an aid package to Ukraine was being held up at the time \u2014 was that the Ukrainians would have felt compelled to manufacture damaging information on the Bidens . That didn \u2019 t happen , and the aid , thanks to congressional pressure , was released in short order\u2026\n\u201c Ukraine lacks the hallmarks of other presidential scandals . There \u2019 s been no cover-up . Trying to keep a transcript of a presidential call from leaking in the absence of any congressional or criminal investigation doesn \u2019 t qualify . And once the controversy became public , the White House rapidly released key documents . Nor is there any violation of law . Trump \u2019 s ask of Zelenskiy wasn \u2019 t extortion or a campaign-finance violation under any rational interpretation of our statutes . If it was , practically every president in our history would have had criminal exposure . \u201d\n\u201c Now that House Democrats might \u2014 might ! \u2014 finally have sufficient predicate to pursue impeachment , Pelosi faces another challenge : to convince the American people that this iteration of Trump hysteria is the genuine article\u2026\n\u201c Both Pelosi and the American electorate know that even if this Ukrainian phone call serves as an adequate predicate to impeach a duly elected president , that impeachment \u2014 whether it \u2019 s because Trump is a boor , because he \u2019 s trying to \u2018 take away health care , \u2019 because he \u2019 s a serial philanderer , because he allegedly slept with a porn star , because he has a \u2018 mental illness , \u2019 because he lost the popular vote , because he is ignorant on most matters of domestic and foreign affairs , whatever \u2014 has been the stated goal of much of Pelosi \u2019 s caucus from the day Trump was elected\u2026 Perhaps the seventh time will be the charm . \u201d\nMany argue that \u201c While Trump 's conduct towards the Ukrainian President was unbecoming and evinces poor judgment , Democrats should not be so quick to make this an excuse for reversing an election . It 's quite simple : Trump was legitimately elected . Absent damning evidence of clear wrongdoing , his impeachment will inherently undercut our democracy . It will put the whims of politicians before the lawful choice of voters\u2026\n\u201c To impeach Trump now would be to tell those who voted for him that their popular choice no longer matters . It 's a grave action \u2014 an act of last resort . Democrats should remember that impeachment is n't , ultimately , a legal act . Instead , to adapt from Clausewitz , it is the continuation of politics by other means . And in America , political power belongs to the people . Wherever compatible with the nation 's interests , impeachment should be avoided in favor of elections . And there just happens to be one coming up next fall . \u201d\n\u201c If the situation were reversed , and if a corrupt Republican ex-vice president were running for president , no Democrat would ever hesitate to ask every foreign government in the world for help in investigating that person . Nor do Democrats hesitate to ask for foreign help in investigating sitting Republican presidents . The 2018 letter to Ukraine ( ! ) by Senate Democrats asking for an investigation of Trump is illustrative\u2026 This is not about substance . This is about Pelosi losing control of her caucus should she continue to resist impeachment , and Pelosi sensing a looming electoral disaster of monumental proportions should impeachment be launched outside the parameters she defines . \u201d\nSome argue that Trump \u2019 s \u201c best response is to dismiss this attempt to delegitimize his presidency and go on governing . That means understanding that the real referendum on Trump \u2019 s tenure in the White House comes next year at the ballot box\u2026 Trump can still counterpunch the Democrats on impeachment . But he should also start thinking of winning over the suburban moms who can preserve the Electoral College \u00admajority that sent his opponents into a delusional funk\u2026 Expanding background checks and red-flag laws are no guarantee against more mass shootings . But they will close some loopholes that might keep a few guns out of the wrong hands and do so in a manner that will be no threat to Second Amendment rights or Trump \u2019 s popularity among GOPers . \u201d\n\u201c Trump \u2019 s presidency was bound to put America \u2019 s institutions under a stress test . The intelligence community , the bureaucracy , Congress , the courts , and the media were going to be tempted by this man who didn \u2019 t follow the standard rules of politics . Would these institutions respond by doing their jobs , or would they respond by breaking norms ? \u2026\n\u201c Unfortunately , many supposed guardians of our democracy responded to Trump 's election by smashing norms themselves . Sally Yates , acting as attorney general , flatly refused to enforce the law because merely she thought it unwise and unjust . James Comey , the FBI director , appears to have laid subtle threats and traps for the president . Many of our colleagues in the press utterly abandoned their sobriety when faced with Trump . And then some in the intelligence community took to using their access to the president \u2019 s phone calls as a way to leak information that simply made him look bad\u2026 Our politics has come to feature a vicious circle of ever-escalating norm-breaking . \u201d\nOthers note , \u201c I \u2019 d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame . The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by , for instance , mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels . Trump \u2019 s conversation is typically scattershot , wandering all over the field , leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be\u2026 \u200d \u201c I think Joe Sixpack \u2019 s response is going to be a hearty shrug . After all that has emerged about Trump so far , his approval rating is closely tracking Obama \u2019 s approval at the same point in his presidency .
