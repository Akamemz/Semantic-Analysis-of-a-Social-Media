The law has already hit escape velocity , and by November 2014 it will be a political wash and a bourgeoning success story . By 2016 it 'll be a huge asset to Democrats . If Republicans do n't figure out how to come to terms with its permanence , they will doom themselves for another four years . And even if they reach the acceptance stage , they 'll have to grapple with the fact that their tireless campaign to destroy Hillary Clinton with ugly Benghazi conspiracy theories has already failed , and their own strongest candidate -- Chris Christie -- is about to be permanently crippled by the George Washington Bridge scandal .\nMaybe that 'll all turn out to be right . But I think it 'd be a bad idea for liberals to saunter through the next year or three with such untempered expectations . Obamacare could easily be a political liability for Democrats in November , and even though I do n't doubt its permanence -- or at least the permanence of its coverage guarantee -- it 's possible that it 'll never actually be a big political winner . By 2016 we could easily be on to something else .
