He said DHS made that decision \u201c in recent months . \u201d\nOPM is covered by Einstein 2 , but not Einstein 3 Accelerated .\nBut Einstein 3A wouldn \u2019 t necessarily have prevented hackers from getting in , Seymour said . Einstein blocks known malicious traffic from getting into federal networks , but at the time of the hack , there was no indicator associated with the attackers to upload into Einstein , she explained . \u201c These indicators , once discovered , were loaded into Einstein to provide protections to other federal networks , \u201d she added .\nEconomic sanctions and a limited responsive cyberattack should be on the table if the U.S. determines that some portion of the Chinese government was directly involved , former Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I-Conn. ) said Friday .\n\u201c This was not a cyberattack on our infrastructure in a way that would have greatly disrupted our economy or compromised public safety , \u201d said Lieberman , a former chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee . \u201c For various purposes I wouldn \u2019 t want to escalate to Cyber Defcon 2 or 1 because it wasn \u2019 t an attack on that level . But it can not go unresponded to if we determine with a reasonable degree of certainty where it came from . \u201d\nFederal authorities haven \u2019 t publicly said who they believe is behind the attack . But John Hultquist , a senior manager at iSIGHT Partners , said his firm was attributing the hack to Deep Panda , a group that \u2019 s also known by names like the \u201c Shell_Crew , \u201d \u201c PinkPanther \u201d and \u201c Group 72. \u201d Hultquist said some patterns of the attack match those of the Anthem and Premera breaches , which were revealed in February and March , respectively .\nEvidence linking Deep Panda with the Anthem and Premera hacks stems from patterns found within the Internet \u2019 s address book , known as the domain registration system , Hultquist said . Deep Panda has a tendency of registering look-alike Web domains similar to their targets , such as we11point.com for \u201c Wellpoint , \u201d Anthem \u2019 s previous corporate name . iSIGHT found a pattern of related names being used to register the fake domains \u2014 and a search of domain registration data turned up examples of lookalike OPM websites , he said .\nCrowdStrike , the firm that bestowed the Deep Panda moniker , calls the group \u201c one of the most advanced Chinese nation-state cyber intrusion groups . \u201d\nWhy state-sponsored hackers would want personnel file data remains unknown .\nPersonal data are normally valuable for identity thieves who want to open up fraudulent financial services accounts , or sell the information on the black market for others to use . But so far , none of the data from the Anthem and Premera breaches have showed up for sale or been used for credit card fraud , Hultquist said .\nThe Chinese news service Xinhua dismissed the U.S. allegations as \u201c obviously another case of Washington \u2019 s habitual slander against Beijing on cybersecurity. \u201d It also pointed to the information disclosed by former NSA subcontractor Edward Snowden , saying the U.S. itself is guilty of \u201c large-scale , organized cyber theft , wiretapping and supervision of political figures , enterprises and individuals of other countries , including China . \u201d\nThe latest hack \u2019 s implications are unsettling . This marks the third or fourth known hack of federal personnel data in approximately a year , including an attack in August that officials attributed to the Chinese government . That \u2019 s on top of the Anthem and Premera attacks , along with a recent breach of CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield \u2014 which , combined , mean that hackers have gotten into the health records of as many as 1 in 3 Americans .\nThe Office of Personnel Management said Thursday that it had detected the latest intrusion into its systems in April . The Department of Homeland Security said its US-CERT team concluded in May that OPM data had been compromised .\nParadoxically , detection of the cyberattack is proof that OPM cybersecurity is getting better , Seymour said . Hackers made their way into the system in December and went undetected until April . It was a security upgrade that permitted agency personnel to find the breach and take defensive measures .\nMembers of Congress said the government clearly has not been doing enough .\n\u201c Today \u2019 s reported breach is part of a troubling pattern by this agency in failing to secure the personal data of federal employees \u2014 the second major breach in a year , \u201d said Sen. Mark Warner ( D-Va. ) , a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence , in a statement Thursday night . \u201c Cyberattacks present a critical threat to our national security and our economy . We can not afford to keep dragging our feet in addressing the escalating threats posed by hackers out to steal individuals \u2019 personal information . \u201d\nSenate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr ( R-N.C. ) , committee member Angus King ( I-Maine ) , Senate Homeland Security Chairman Ron Johnson ( R-Wis. ) , House Intelligence Committee ranking member Adam Schiff ( D-Calif. ) and Rep. Gerry Connolly ( D-Va. ) issued similar statements . \u201c We must start to prevent these breaches in the first place , \u201d Burr said .\nExperts on cybersecurity continued to debate whether the evidence points to hackers connected to the Chinese government , as opposed to underworld criminals .\nPeter Cassidy , secretary general of the Anti-Phishing Working Group , questioned trying to assign blame based on the Internet \u2019 s domain registration information , calling it \u201c very inconclusive. \u201d The database is notoriously flawed \u2014 and attribution is also difficult to do based purely on technical data . \u201c On the Internet , there \u2019 s nothing more ambiguous than geography , \u201d he said .\nOn the other hand , Cassidy said , the information stolen from OPM \u2019 s computers would undoubtedly be useful to crooks . \u201c When you have that much personal data , you \u2019 ve another opportunity to do something else , like apply for a credit card , \u201d he said .\nOne federal official said he didn \u2019 t know whether the hackers were state-sponsored or not .\n\u201c China is not a monolith , \u201d the official said . \u201c There are many different things that can be Chinese . You may be seeing something where we \u2019 re not going to be pointing the finger [ in public ] , because we don \u2019 t have an indictment to lay down . \u201d\n\u201c It could be that some underworld actors are being contracted by government actor , \u201d the official added .\nRob Knake , a former cybersecurity official in the Obama White House , said on Thursday that he thought the breach was \u201c more likely to have been a criminal act , \u201d aimed at enabling crimes like online payments fraud , as opposed to launching attacks against U.S. national security . \u201c It \u2019 s of very limited value within the intelligence community , \u201d said Knake , who served on the National Security Council staff until earlier this year . \u201c It doesn \u2019 t make sense to me that a state intelligence agency would want to deploy resources to get the Social Security number of clerks at the Commerce Department . \u201d\nBut other cyber experts said the data could be useful to Chinese intelligence in understanding relationships between federal workers and in allowing them to craft more effective phishing emails .\n\u201c This is information that will help them break into other systems , \u201d for instance by identifying who the system administrators are for any given department , said former federal Chief Information Security Officer Mark Graff . Administrators are the favorite target for hackers looking to steal passwords because they have broad access to every part of the network .\n\u201d I think this is a stepping stone to further intrusions , \u201d agreed Hultquist .\nThe hacked database is the Central Personnel Data System File , a repository for personal information for the entire federal workforce of 2 million and for just more than 2 million federal retirees and other former employees , officials from the American Federation of Government Employees said .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve been told that they got the whole personnel data central file , \u201d said Jacqueline Simon , the AFGE \u2019 s public policy director .\nThe data includes names , addresses , pay grades , records of personnel actions such as reprimands , and pension , insurance and health plan details .
