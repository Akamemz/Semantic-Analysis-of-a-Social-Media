McCarthy vows change to save GOP\nHAUPPAUGE , N.Y. \u2014 House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy landed here from Los Angeles with a bang : He bluntly warned that Republicans will blow the presidency in 2016 if they don \u2019 t make some radical changes \u2014 and quick .\nMcCarthy , speaking without a working microphone , told a group of Long Island donors that Republicans \u2019 gains in the House will amount to little if they can \u2019 t govern over the next two years .\n\u201c I do know this , \u201d McCarthy said . \u201c If we don \u2019 t capture the House stronger , and the Senate , and prove we could govern , there won \u2019 t be a Republican president in 2016 . \u201d\nThe crowd groaned at his prediction . McCarthy feels the same .\nIn a series of interviews with \u2588\u2588\u2588 in his office in D.C. , in a Capitol Police SUV in New York and aboard a rented private jet flying above the Empire State , McCarthy , who became the No . 2 Republican in the House this summer , laid out in the richest detail yet his goals for a Republican-controlled Capitol Hill .\nLegislative cliffs are over . One muscular , unified agenda will bridge both chambers . If he has his way , House and Senate Republicans will kick off the year at a joint retreat to get on the same page . He and Sen. John Thune ( R-S.D . ) have already been holding private dinners with lawmakers from both chambers to build relationships .\n\u201c You have a lot of new people over there and [ they ] don \u2019 t instinctively like the Senate to start with , which I get , \u201d Thune said in an interview . \u201c In the House , it \u2019 s a dynamic where you really have to work it . And we \u2019 re trying to do a better job of that . \u201d\nMcCarthy \u2019 s vision is a departure from the past four years under former Majority Leader Eric Cantor , when brinkmanship and dysfunction ruled . Now , alienated voters must be won back for the GOP to have a shot at the White House in 2016 .\n\u201c My belief is you have one chance to make a first impression , \u201d McCarthy said , as his black SUV crawled eastward on Long Island . \u201c From the very first day after the election , we should be laying out to the American public what the expectations are . Why make two different agendas ? \u201d\nMcCarthy is intently focused on the first few months in session , which he sees as critical for his agenda . He would like to use the lame-duck session to pass a long-term government-funding bill , so Washington can begin focusing on big-picture legislating , instead of just trying to keep government \u2019 s doors open . He also is aiming to renew a host of lapsed business-focused tax provisions and renew the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act \u2014 two items with bipartisan support .\n\u201c If we are fortunate to have both majorities , take away any cliff you can have hanging out there , \u201d McCarthy said , sitting in his SUV fiddling with an iPhone and Blackberry . \u201c If you have a cliff , it takes attention away . Why put cliffs up that hold us back from doing bigger policy ? \u201d\nThe party \u2019 s ability to coalesce around large-scale legislation is certainly in doubt , but McCarthy seems willing to pass small-bore bills on issues ranging from energy to health care to taxes . He sees it as a way to draw constant contrasts with President Barack Obama and to split Democrats . Maybe Obama will sign some bills into law , he says . If he doesn \u2019 t , it will set up a clean discussion for the 2016 presidential election .\nEnergy policy will be a priority , in addition to repealing the medical device tax and the independent payment board for Medicare \u2014 bills that Democrats have mostly ignored over the past few years . Highway spending will likely come up , McCarthy said , and it could be funded by new drilling on public lands .\nOf course , critics inside and outside the Republican establishment say the party \u2019 s revival is dependent not only on a functioning Congress , but also on passing policies like immigration reform \u2014 an uncertain prospect in a Republican-controlled Congress .\nMcCarthy left open the possibility of passing an overhaul of immigration laws but said if Obama \u201c tried to do it by executive order , that \u2019 s the worst way , \u201d and it would \u201c stop everything . \u201d\nInside Washington , McCarthy sees himself re-imagining government . He fashions himself as a D.C. disruptor , of sorts .\nOne of his chief goals is to rework the federal bureaucracy . In his travel throughout more than 100 congressional districts , McCarthy says he has sensed a great distrust in the federal government . He says voters are frustrated with Obama \u2019 s handling of Ebola , the health care law , the IRS and Secret Service scandals . And that \u2019 s why he is setting up a congressional mechanism to whittle away at inefficiencies that plague the government . He likens his plans to the commission that shut down underused military bases . He wonders why many city governments operate online and the federal government still conducts business on paper .\nEfficiency in governing is important for McCarthy , which is why he says he wants a governor as the 2016 GOP nominee , and , when asked which state executive he likes , he mentioned Michigan Gov . Rick Snyder .\nHis rearranging of Washington won \u2019 t spare the Capitol . He is looking to audit the congressional committee structure , rework the way Congress writes the nation \u2019 s budget and plans to , once and for all , sync the Senate and House \u2019 s schedules to improve efficiency . He also wants the House out of session on days besides Friday , so lawmakers can be around their hometowns during the week . And House committees , he said , should be doing far more fieldwork .\nOf course , McCarthy \u2019 s vision is predicated on a Republican majority in both chambers . But he \u2019 s bullish on that . He privately tells donors he believes there \u2019 s a \u201c 75 percent \u201d chance the GOP will take the Senate .\nMcCarthy \u2019 s ascent was sudden \u2014 he \u2019 s been majority leader only since Aug. 1 \u2014 so much of Washington is waiting to see how he shapes and molds his power . He has been working to get up to speed on policy \u2014 he \u2019 s not much of a wonk .\nHe is sure to cut a different image than Cantor , his predecessor and good friend . The two are still close , and McCarthy isn \u2019 t eager to draw direct contrasts , but the differences are obvious . McCarthy is already meeting more with committee chairmen , and he wants near universal buy in on legislation . He wants committee chairmen to seek input from the rank and file early in the bill-drafting conference so problems don \u2019 t surface when legislation hits the floor . \u201c As a majority , \u201d he said , \u201c you should be able to solve your problems ahead of time . \u201d\nMcCarthy has learned from his sometimes rocky tenure as whip \u2014 and from Cantor \u2019 s time as majority leader .
