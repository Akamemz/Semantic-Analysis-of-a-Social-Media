Because it would provide Hillary Clinton \u201c a clear shot to the Oval Office. \u201d Rubio then added , \u201c So I think there \u2019 s a kind of weird bias here in the media rooting for Donald Trump because they know he \u2019 s the easiest Republican to beat . \u201d\nThe notion that the so-called lamestream media ( a neologism popularized by Sarah Palin ) has a liberal bias is , as those of us on the left know , widespread on the right . But as those of us on the left also know , it \u2019 s simply false . First of all , as a 2015 article in Politico notes , Fox News \u201c easily dominate [ s ] the cable news landscape. \u201d It \u2019 s the third most watched channel on TV , and it has \u201c the top 14 most-viewed cable news shows. \u201d Another survey reveals that Fox News is by far the \u201c most trusted national news channel \u201d in America , as hard as that may be for some to believe . Furthermore , anyone with a functioning nervous system can see that Fox News is an activist organization with strong conservative principles that effectively functions as a branch of the Republican Party . Its motto \u201c Fair and Balanced \u201d could hardly be more Orwellian , given the right-wing lens through which it views world affairs . It follows that American news is , if anything , conservative in its overall political orientation . Fox News is more popular , influential and trusted than any other network in the country . It is the lamestream media .\nSecond , if there \u2019 s a discernible bias toward \u201c liberal \u201d views among other , less-watched news networks , it \u2019 s for one simple reason . To borrow a phrase from the comedian Stephen Colbert : \u201c Reality has a well-known liberal bias. \u201d For example , consider the persistent and widely held myth of American exceptionalism . As I detail in a previous article for \u2588\u2588\u2588 , with respect to a huge range of life-quality categories like prosperity , happiness , opportunity , education , health and so on , the United States consistently fails to rank as one of the top 10 best countries in the world . In some cases \u2014 for example , with respect to childhood poverty \u2014 we \u2019 re barely even a developed country . And as Politifact recently confirmed , the American dream is actually easier to fulfill in Europe than it is in the contemporary U.S .\nThe facts simply don \u2019 t support the view that America is , in the eloquent words of Sean Hannity , \u201c the greatest , best country God has ever given man on the face of the earth. \u201d Furthermore , when it comes to issues like climate change , environmental degradation , torture , taxes , healthcare , immigration , racism and terrorism \u2014 to name just a few \u2014 reality clearly supports a progressive worldview . The fact is that sea levels are rising due to greenhouse gases , there \u2019 s a serious problem of institutionalized racism among the police , and trickle-down economics doesn \u2019 t work . Don \u2019 t blame the messenger when verifiable claims about the world happen to support \u201c liberal \u201d persuasions rather than conservative ones .\nAnd finally , yes , the media \u2014 including Fox News \u2014 does have a single pervasive bias that colors its reporting of news events . I \u2019 ll admit that the venerable senator from Florida is half-correct . But the bias isn \u2019 t what conservatives are so stubbornly convinced that it is . Rubio himself seems to acknowledge the existence of this special bias when he says ( from the same conversation quoted above ) that , \u201c One , I think [ the media ] think [ that covering Trump is ] going to be good for ratings. \u201d Stop right there , Rubio \u2014 you nailed it . As the social critic and comedian Jon Stewart once insightfully suggested during an interview with Chris Wallace , the media is strongly biased towards apolitical phenomena like \u201c conflict \u201d and \u201c sensationalism . \u201d\nIs Stewart right ? Well , I can hardly think of a better confirmation of his hypothesis than the media \u2019 s incessant coverage of Donald Trump . Why does CNN ignore Bernie Sanders \u2019 huge rallies but broadcast Trump \u2019 s incoherent ramblings about \u201c winning , winning , winning \u201d and \u201c China , China , China \u201d ( interspersed with references to violating the Geneva Conventions and bringing back waterboarding ) ? The answer isn \u2019 t conspiratorial , as Rubio intimated : There \u2019 s no grand plan to get a Democrat in the White House by pitting Sanders or Clinton against the highly unfavorable Trump . Things are much simpler than this : Trump shaking a water bottle around and shouting , \u201c It \u2019 s Rubio ! \u201d is just plain more entertaining than watching Sanders discuss substantive issues that genuinely impact American life . The media are in the business of maximizing profits , and there \u2019 s a lot more money to be made covering Trump than Sanders , Clinton , Rubio or Cruz . It \u2019 s capitalism , Rubio \u2014 you know , the economic system that you so dearly cherish .\nBut there is a cynical background to this picture . Yes , the American audience craves mindless , inane entertainment over intricate discussions of arcane policy . But a demagogue like Trump wouldn \u2019 t be possible if not for the impoverished culture of anti-intellectualism that conservative media like Fox News have worked so tirelessly to foment . On the one hand , at least seven studies to date show that Fox News denizens constitute the most misinformed news audience in the country . One study even found that Fox News viewers are more misinformed than people who don \u2019 t watch any news at all . From climate change to Obama \u2019 s birthplace to the Iraq War to Obamacare , conservatives are far more likely to hold demonstrably false beliefs \u2014 often with tremendous , unshakable confidence . On the other hand , and even more significantly , Fox News instills in its viewers a formidable distaste for critical thinking . It encourages dogmatism while discouraging curiosity . It teaches people to care more about \u201c what \u201d a belief says about the world than \u201c why \u201d one should accept it . It propagates what philosophers would describe as bad epistemology .\nThis is incredibly dangerous to our country \u2019 s future because critical thinking is the intellectual backbone of every functioning democracy . The fact that Trump is leading a pack of truth-challenged White House hopefuls is unambiguous evidence that our democracy is not functioning properly . A dysfunctional democracy is , of course , exactly what Fox News wants , for the obvious reason that it makes controlling the masses of cognitively stunted voters much easier . But then Trump rolled in from left field with his billions of dollars and charismatic authoritarianism and quickly filled the vacuum of ignorance , fear and gullibility that Fox News and its media cohorts had diligently carved out for the past seven years .\nSo , Rubio is right that the media is biased , but wrong that this bias is \u201c liberal. \u201d Perhaps Rubio should start bullying the bully of bullies right back . Mocking Trump \u2019 s \u201c small hands \u201d and suggesting that Trump wet his pants during one of the Republican debates is a good start , for sure . But there are plenty of potential jokes that are being left untold by Rubio and his fellow underdog candidates . They could , for example , laugh about the \u201c greasy and tasteless \u201d Trump Steaks ( sold only by the Sharper Image ) , make fun of Trump for a cringe-worthy incest joke about dating his daughter , or encourage their followers to start referring to Trump as \u201c Drumpf , \u201d a hilariously strange monosyllabic sound that was once his family \u2019 s surname . If Rubio stoops down to Trump \u2019 s fourth-grade level of interacting with his opponents , he might just find himself with a bit more media attention .",
