The two-night event will take place from 9 to 11 pm Eastern on Wednesday and Thursday in Miami , and will air on NBC , MSNBC , and Telemundo . A live stream is embedded below .\nThis is the first time Democratic candidates will get to square off on the same stage . But they won \u2019 t all debate together : A different set of 10 candidates will be featured on each night .\nOn Wednesday , the first night of the debate , Elizabeth Warren , Beto O \u2019 Rourke , Cory Booker , and Amy Klobuchar will be the leading candidates participating . Warren will likely be the main attraction here , as she \u2019 s had a bit of a bump in polls of late .\nThen on the second night , Thursday , Joe Biden , Bernie Sanders , Kamala Harris , and Pete Buttigieg will be the most notable contenders in the roster . They also happen to be four of the five top-polling candidates overall , with Biden remaining the clear frontrunner \u2014 which makes him a potential target .\nAdditionally , a dozen other candidates currently polling around the 1 percent level \u2014 some senators , some members of Congress , and some who have never held elected office \u2014 will all be trying to take advantage of this national platform to better stand out in the field .\nAfter months of campaign announcements and early campaigning , the first debate begins a new phase in the Democratic nomination contest \u2014 and in particular , it marks the first high-profile test for frontrunner Joe Biden .\nJoe Biden is winning \u2014 but he \u2019 s facing tougher attacks : There are 25 at least somewhat notable Democratic candidates in the race , 20 of whom qualified for the first debate . But there \u2019 s just one who is indisputably the man to beat : Joe Biden . The former vice president has led nearly every national and early state poll so far this year , and he \u2019 s currently ahead by 15 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics national poll average .\nMany Democratic voters perceive Biden as the most \u201c electable \u201d candidate ( an assessment that is generally backed up by polls pitting the candidates against President Trump ) . They may also have fond memories of the Obama administration and view Biden as next in line . Yet certain aspects of Biden \u2019 s political persona fit uncomfortably with a changing Democratic Party , and those problems came to the fore last week .\nAt a recent fundraiser , Biden reminisced about how he used to be able to work productively with segregationist senators ( in contrast to today \u2019 s lack of \u201c civility \u201d ) . The comments sparked criticism from several candidates , including Cory Booker , who called on Biden to apologize . Biden also has been much more skeptical of the \u201c class warfare \u201d economic message candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have embraced \u2014 and at the same fundraiser , he told wealthy donors that though \u201c income inequality \u201d needs to be addressed , \u201c nothing will fundamentally change \u201d for them during his presidency .\nThese are just the latest of many examples in Biden \u2019 s career where his mouth has gotten him into some trouble . Separately , there are also questions about Biden \u2019 s age : He \u2019 s 76 , and would be 78 years old by inauguration day 2021 . So the first debate is an important moment for him \u2014 it presents both an opportunity to put these various fears to rest and a high-pressure setting in which he could make yet more problems for himself .\nSanders , Warren , Harris , and Buttigieg are the rest of the top tier : Beyond Biden , four other candidates have emerged from the pack in polls so far .\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has most often been in second place \u2014 and while his support remains significant , his coalition from 2016 has clearly split somewhat in the more crowded field .

Then there \u2019 s Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren . She had a weak start to the campaign but has taken a policy-heavy approach ( she \u201c has a plan for that , \u201d the catchphrase goes ) and has recently risen to third place .

She remains a top-tier candidate , but she \u2019 s had some trouble getting headlines \u2014 and currently , she \u2019 s not getting all that much support from black voters . South Bend , Indiana , Mayor Pete Buttigieg has done the best of any candidate who started off the year unknown . Many national Democrats were impressed with the 37-year-old Harvard-educated gay veteran , and Buttigieg \u2019 s polling and fundraising numbers soon reflected that . However , these Buttigieg supporters have so far tended to be overwhelmingly white , and his relationship with the black community in South Bend isn \u2019 t great , as the controversy over a recent police shooting in the city has demonstrated .\nA whole lot of other candidates are trying their luck : Finally , one thing the debate will make unmistakably clear is that there are a lot of Democrats in this race . The combination of Trump looking beatable , Biden not being an overwhelmingly dominant frontrunner , and Trump \u2019 s own surprising outsider win has spurred many Democrats to wonder : Why not me ? Lenient qualification standards have let nearly all of them get into the first debate , and now they \u2019 re all hoping to have some sort of \u201c moment \u201d that will send them into the top tier .\nKnowing that the field of candidates would be enormous , the DNC tried to avoid repeating Republicans \u2019 example in 2015 , when they featured a primetime debate of the top-polling candidates and an earlier \u201c kiddie table \u201d debate with those polling worse .\nSo the DNC separated the candidates into groups \u2014 those polling at 2 percent or above , and those below that level . They ensured each group would be split equally among the two nights , and then held a random drawing to see which candidates would be on each night .\nNow each of these debate nights will be two hours long , with 10 candidates onstage . If speaking time is split equally among every candidate , they \u2019 d get just 12 minutes each \u2014 and that \u2019 s before taking out time for the moderators and for breaks . So time is precious , and the contenders will struggle to make every moment count .\nThe first night : Warren , O \u2019 Rourke , Booker , Klobuchar , and the rest\nArranged from left ( with the best-polling candidates in the middle ) , the lineup for Wednesday night \u2019 s first debate is :\nWarren is the only one of the top five candidates who ended up being assigned to this night of the debate . As a result , she can \u2019 t take on her most prominent rivals face to face \u2014 but she will have a major opportunity to stand out .\nStill , it \u2019 s not like she \u2019 s facing a group of slouches . O \u2019 Rourke and Booker are both compelling speakers , and Booker has been in the news due to his criticism of Biden . Klobuchar has a reputation for bipartisanship . Inslee is focusing his campaign on climate change , while Gabbard is critiquing US foreign policy , and Castro has put out a flurry of his own policy proposals . Without most of the top contenders there to take up time , it could be easier for a lesser-known contender to get some attention .\nThe second night : Biden , Sanders , Harris , Buttigieg , and the rest\nAgain , from left , the lineup for the second debate night is :\nDue to the luck of the draw , this is effectively the marquee night for the debate \u2014 with frontrunner Biden , second-place Sanders , and tied-for-fourth-place Harris and Buttigieg all onstage .\nAnd all eyes will be on Biden . He \u2019 s certainly no stranger to the format \u2014 his first presidential debate was 32 years ago , and he was in several more during his 2007 campaign , as well as general election vice presidential debates in 2008 and 2012 . Still , as the clear frontrunner , the pressure will be on , and his rivals will be sure to pounce on any misstep .\nSanders , for instance , will have an opportunity to make the case that his vision for the presidency would be far different \u2014 he wants a \u201c political revolution , \u201d whereas Biden emphatically does not . Harris and Buttigieg , too , could argue that new leadership is needed for the party . But it \u2019 s not clear just how aggressive these candidates will be in attacking Biden ; they could decide it \u2019 s a mistake to go too negative this early .\nThe two Democratic candidates without experience in political office will also be onstage on this night . Marianne Williamson , an author who has written books about spirituality , has recently tried to backtrack from comments she made criticizing vaccines . Meanwhile , entrepreneur Andrew Yang will tout his plan for a universal basic income of $ 1,000 a month . With most of the top-polling contenders as well as Williamson and Yang on this night , it may be more difficult for the other politicians onstage \u2014 Gillibrand , Bennet , Hickenlooper , and Swalwell \u2014 to stand out .\nThe second Democratic debate , on July 30 and 31 , will be a similar two-night affair , with similar qualification rules .\nBut after that , the DNC has said , it \u2019 s raising the bar . Candidates will have to hit 2 percent in at least four polls , and they \u2019 ll also have to have 130,000 unique donors . The donor threshold in particular will be challenging for many candidates who currently don \u2019 t have national followings .
