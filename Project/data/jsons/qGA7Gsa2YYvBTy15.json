It would be years before the White House wanted Holder to speak openly about race again .\nIt was n't the only backlash he faced in his tenure , but his years also were marked by big criminal prosecutions and significant shifts in Justice Department priorities .\nAfter a massive explosion on an oil rig off Houston in April 2010 led to the largest oil spill in U.S. history , the Justice Department led the criminal investigation . It eventually reached a $ 4 billion settlement with BP , the company running the rig at the time of the accident .\n`` BP has agreed to plead guilty to all 14 criminal charges , '' Holder said in announcing the agreement , `` including responsibility for the deaths of 11 people and the events that led to an unprecedented environmental catastrophe .

'' Connaughton asks . `` The answer is no . ''\nCharles Ferguson , whose documentary on the mortgage meltdown won an Academy Award in 2011 , used his turn at the awards ceremony to make this point .\n`` I must start by pointing out that three years after a horrific financial crisis caused by massive fraud , not a single financial executive has gone to jail , '' Ferguson said . `` And that 's wrong .

The defendants had been held at Guantanamo for years , but Holder said they 'd face justice on U.S. soil .\n`` They will be brought to New York , to New York , to answer for their alleged crimes in a courthouse just blocks away from where the twin towers once stood , '' Holder said .\nWithin months , that plan fell apart . Families of some 9/11 victims protested , New York 's police chief warned that security costs would spiral out of control , and senators from both political parties expressed alarm .\nThe attorney general withdrew indictments and announced he would send the cases to military tribunals \u2014 where they still linger today \u2014 but not without parting shots at his political critics .\n`` The reality is , though , I know this case in a way that members of Congress do not , '' Holder said . `` I 've looked at the files .
