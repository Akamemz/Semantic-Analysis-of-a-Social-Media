When did believing that we should have a border and that people shouldn \u2019 t be able to cross it illegally become \u201c racism ? \u201d When did expecting politicians to tell us the truth if they want our vote become too much to ask ?\nWe live in a country where Hillary Clinton is so above the law that the FBI refuses to prosecute her even when it catches her dead to rights and illegal aliens are aided by the government in breaking our own laws with impunity . Our government can \u2019 t balance the budget , secure the border or win a war ; yet no one ever seems to pay a price for incompetence .\nNo one in D.C. who \u2019 s in charge of anything today deserves to be in charge of it after the election . We \u2019 ve already reached banana republic levels of corruption , incompetence and arrogance in D.C . The only people who have a real voice in America are the rich , the powerful and the special interest groups . Ordinary Americans who point out how broken , dysfunctional and haywire things are going in this country are laughed at and impugned .\nAnyone who thinks that way must be one of those racists , one of those \u201c deplorables , \u201d one of those hicks in flyover country whose opinions don \u2019 t matter . Obviously , they don \u2019 t understand how all these things work because if they did , then they \u2019 d realize that the smartest people were already in charge . You can tell that these people are smart because of how they talk and the schools they went to , not because they actually get anything done for the country . For example , if the Affordable Care Act actually did everything our Harvard educated President promised it would do , it would have been great . Unfortunately , Obamacare isn \u2019 t great because the entire project was sold with lies . Isn \u2019 t it so funny that all those dumb \u201c deplorables \u201d and \u201c hicks in flyover country \u201d seemed to know it all along while the \u201c smart set \u201d in the media and in D.C. seemed to be the ones who were buffaloed by all of Obama \u2019 s meaningless promises about the program ?\nThere is no problem too big for Americans to handle , but there \u2019 s also no big problem that will ever be handled as long as \u201c leaders \u201d like Chuck Schumer , Nancy Pelosi , Mitch McConnell , Paul Ryan , Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are in charge of anything .\nAmerica \u2019 s elite seem to believe that the country is indestructible .
