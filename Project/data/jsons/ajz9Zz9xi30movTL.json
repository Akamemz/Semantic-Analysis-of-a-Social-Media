    "content": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday after meeting with the House Democratic caucus that there will not be a vote at this time to launch formal impeachment proceedings or to formalize the ongoing inquiry against President Donald Trump .\n`` There 's no requirement that we have a vote , and so at this time we will not be having a vote , '' Pelosi told reporters toward the end of a press conference called after she met with House leaders to discuss a potential formal vote . `` We 're not here to call bluffs . We 're here to find the truth , to uphold the Constitution of the United States . This is not a game for us . This is deadly serious . ''\nDuring the press conference , Pelosi seemed more interested in talking about legislation underway in the House , and about recent court awards in Democrats ' favor , but she did have sharp words about Trump and the ongoing investigation into his conversation with Ukraine 's president about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter .\n`` Last Friday we won five decisions in our favor in terms of Congress ' authority under the Constitution , and today another decision came down in our favor in relationship to emoluments ... another recognition that our founders had very deep suspicion about foreigners interfering in our government , and , again , in our elections . ''\nMeanwhile , the fact that there is an inquiry of a president asking a foreign government to ask for help with his reelection `` by granting or withholding in the timing of military assistance that has been voted on by the Congress has so many violations in it . It undermines our national security .
