He reached what is left of his family in mid-March after fleeing Al-Baghouz , a speck of land on the banks of the Euphrates in Syria where ISIS suffered defeat at the hands of a U.S.-backed coalition of Kurdish and Arab forces .\n\u201c When he is in a good mood , he is a fun boy , you \u2019 d never believe he was held by ISIS , \u201d explains Jihad , a day laborer who was away from Sinjar when ISIS attacked .\nISIS \u2019 s so-called caliphate may have come to an end , but the terror these jihadists inflicted on the Yazidi community is forever seared into the minds of boys like 10-year-old Dilber and his older brother Dildar , 15 . The siblings each look a good three years younger than their age , except for their eyes .\nThey form part of a generation of Yazidis whose fathers were executed , mothers and sisters enslaved , and who themselves were so relentlessly indoctrinated and beaten that some ended their lives , taking part in suicide attacks . The journey of healing promises to be long , and help is scant .\nDilber and Dildar spent the final days of the caliphate in March sleeping in ditches , drinking leftover wash-water , and begging civilian families for one daily portion of rank soup . Both struggle to speak Kurdish after years of being commanded in Arabic .\n\u201c It took us just two days to learn how to use a rifle , but the Quran took forever , \u201d says Dildar . \u201c They beat us if we didn \u2019 t learn the religion quickly enough . I have memorized about a quarter of the Quran . The ones who failed to memorize the Quran would be beaten with sticks and water hoses . \u201d\nHis cousin , Hani , is in better shape physically but is likewise familiar with the toll that life under ISIS can take psychologically . Hani spent more than a year in captivity before being rescued through smugglers along with his mother .\n\u201c It takes a long time to learn your language and get rid of their ideology , \u201d says Hani . \u201c Sometimes ISIS ideas pop into your head : Memorize the Quran ! Forget your infidel family ! \u201d\nDominique Soguel Dildar ( l ) , a former Yazidi conscript into ISIS , and his cousin Hani , who spent less time in ISIS captivity before being rescued , at an IDP camp in northern Iraq in March . \u201c They beat us if we didn \u2019 t learn the religion quickly enough , \u201d says Dildar , 15 , who spent his final days in the caliphate sleeping in ditches . \u201c I have memorized about a quarter of the Quran . \u201d\nAs the cousins \u2013 dressed in matching Juventus outfits \u2013 compare notes , a steady stream of well-wishers pour into the white small caravan where they live to celebrate their arrival . Others inquire about still-missing relatives .\nZiad Avdalo is a member of a team that has been rescuing Yazidi boys from ISIS for over three years . On the outskirts of Amuda in northern Syria , he runs the Yazidi House , which shelters survivors until they can cross back to Iraq .\nThe trauma and indoctrination of these boys , he says , renders caring for them a delicate task . \u201c We have boys who have arrived here more fundamentalist than ISIS , \u201d says Mr. Avdalo . \u201c Those who are very dogmatic we deal with very lightly and simply ; until their memories come back . \u201d\nSome survivors are housed among Yazidi villagers in Syria until they can make the journey home . For many it was tough to establish where that is .\n\u201c One six-year-old boy didn \u2019 t even know his own name , so we nicknamed him Judi , \u201d says Mr. Avdalo . \u201c Another didn \u2019 t know the name of his father . \u201d\nMr. Avdalo , himself a Yazidi , slams the international community for failing to support the survivors , but firmly believes that Yazidi families \u2013 or what is left of them in Iraq \u2013 are the best-equipped to nurse them back to health . \u201c If anyone cared about the Yazidi community this never would have happened , \u201d he says flatly .\nThe Autonomous Administration , a proto-government operating in northeast Syria , grants the Yazidi House about $ 1,000 per month , but that barely covers costs . The Kurdish Red Crescent helps by providing basic medical treatment .\nBut with Syria already confronting waves of displacement since 2011 , there was no targeted response focused on the Yazidis freed by the fall of Baghouz , humanitarian workers in northeast Syria say .\nIn northern Iraq , home to dozens of camps for displaced people , resources are limited . Dohuk has only a handful of psychologists who initially focused on helping Yazidi women but now provide help to boys as well . Their interventions are irregular , complicated by the fact that victims are widely scattered .\nMany Yazidis have left Iraq , finding asylum in Australia , the United States , and Germany , among other nations . It is an exodus opposed by many community leaders .\n\u201c Once they are gone , they are [ spiritually ] annihilated , \u201d says Mr. Avdalo . \u201c It is better they stay in their land , among their people . We have a lot of experience now when it comes to healing . \u201d\nAt the IDP camp in Iraq , photographs of the missing \u2013 especially women and children who had a better shot at survival \u2013 adorn the walls of every caravan . The camp is home to several natives of Kocho , one of the Yazidi villages ISIS attacked in the Sinjar mountains .\nKocho , a disputed territory claimed both by the Kurdish Regional Government and authorities in Baghdad , had a population of nearly 2,000 people before the rise of ISIS .

Like other boys who underwent military and religious training under ISIS , he recalled being beaten with sticks and berated on a daily basis .\n\u201c We didn \u2019 t say a word about it , but through it all we thought of our families , \u201d he says . \u201c There are some who fought and some who blew themselves up .
