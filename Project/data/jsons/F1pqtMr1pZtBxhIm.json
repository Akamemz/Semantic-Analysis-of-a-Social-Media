The speech comes as the inspector general at the Veterans Affairs Department is releasing a report on the scandal over phony wait times at the Phoenix VA hospital.\n\nROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:\n\nThere's a new development today in the scandal over wait times of Veterans Affairs health centers. The VA's Inspector General has released a long-awaited report. It could not prove that any veterans died because of long waits at the Phoenix health center, but the report found big problems which extend well beyond Phoenix. It says VA hospitals across the nation fake data on wait times.\n\nMELISSA BLOCK, HOST:\n\nA short time before the report was made public, President Obama addressed the scandal in a speech to the American Legion.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: What I want to know directly from me is that we're focused on this at the highest levels. We are going to get to the bottom of these problems. We're going to fix what is wrong. We're going to do right by you, and we are going to do right by your families. And that is a solemn pledge and commitment that I'm making to you here.\n\nBLOCK: In a moment, we'll talk with a top official at the VA, but first NPR's Quil Lawrence, who covers veteran's issues. And he joins me now to talk about the findings of the Inspector General's report. And Quil, the initial allegation was that 40 people had died waiting for care at the Phoenix VA. This report did not conclude that was the case. What did it say?\n\nQUIL LAWRENCE, BYLINE: Well, it said it was unable to conclusively say these delays with the causes of death. And some of the patients they - the cases they looked into were incurable. So the delay wouldn't have made much for difference. But for example, there's one case - a man in his sixties. He had been homeless. He had emphysema. He died in a private hospital. So he was getting care, just not at the VA. But the Phoenix VA didn't call with his appointment until three months after he died. Others seemed just like pure luck. A man in his mid-fifties - he had skin lesions.

Another example - a veteran who had lung cancer - he was not going to get better, but he could've gotten palliative care much sooner, and that is big issue with an aging veterans population.
