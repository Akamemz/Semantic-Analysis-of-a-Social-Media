In fact , support for repeal now is exactly the same as it was when the law first passed .\nConsistently , for the past two years , most voters have expressed the view that the law will hurt the quality of care , increase the cost of care and increase the federal deficit .\nAs a result , the fact that the law remains in place may end up hurting the president 's chances for re-election more than helping them . It gives Mitt Romney another easy target and one that can be tied directly into concerns about the economy .\nIf Romney wins , there is virtually no chance the existing health care law will survive .\nIf the president is re-elected , the law has a better chance of surviving , but it would still face an uphill struggle . Legislative battles to protect the law would most likely dominate his second term .\nTo understand why , keep in mind that most Americans initially supported the concept of health care reform because they wanted the cost of care to be reduced . But only 18 percent believe the current law will accomplish that goal . A massive 81 percent also believe it will end up costing the government more than projected .\nThe president believes that government regulation can control the cost of care , but most voters disagree . Voters think that consumer choice and competition between insurance companies will do more to reduce costs than additional regulations .\nIndividual Americans recognize that they have more power as consumers than they do as voters .
