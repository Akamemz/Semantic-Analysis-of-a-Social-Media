    "content": "These are not happy times in Baton Rouge , where government officials are desperately trying to plug a $ 1.6 billion budget shortfall . But even by that standard , Wednesday , April 22 , was particularly fraught .\nIn the imposing state capitol that Huey Long built , the Senate Finance Committee was wrestling with a complicated cost-cutting scheme to repeal an inventory tax that businesses pay to local governments and that the state rebates to the businesses , all while promising to somehow make stressed-out local leaders whole .\nJust down the road , Louisiana State University President and Chancellor F. King Alexander said that the state \u2019 s flagship university , which could lose 80 percent of state funding after years of already deep cuts , was developing a worst-case scenario plan for financial exigency\u2014basically the academic equivalent of bankruptcy .\nIn the midst of it all came a message from Republican Governor Bobby Jindal , whose policies and priorities have contributed mightily to the state \u2019 s fiscal mess .\n\u201c Help wish my friends Willie , Phil and Si a happy birthday , \u201d said the tweet , which was accompanied by a photo of Willie Robertson , whose family is featured on the popular homegrown reality TV show Duck Dynasty . It then directed readers to the website for the American Future Project , a 527 issue advocacy group that Jindal has set up in advance of his anticipated presidential run .\nIf the tweet suggests a stunning disconnect from the dire budget situation that \u2019 s unfolding on his watch , well , that \u2019 s how it is these days .\nJindal , a hard-charging former Rhodes Scholar , has always nursed grander ambitions , and voters generally gave him a pass . That was when things were going well .\nThese days they \u2019 re not , and Jindal \u2019 s focus on the upcoming presidential primaries has taken a toll back home . While he was popular and powerful enough to avoid a reelection fight in 2011 , by 2015 his approval rating had sunk to 27 percent , according to one poll ; a friendly survey by his own consulting firm pegged the number at 46 percent , hardly a resounding vote of confidence .\nIt \u2019 s not just his frequent trips to places like Iowa , New Hampshire , and Washington , D.C. , that have angered his constituents . ( He spent 165 days out of state in 2014 , according to The Advocate newspaper . ) Nor is it only his odd forays into international and national affairs , from the tall tales in London about Muslim no-go zones , to his op-ed in The New York Times accusing companies that oppose religious freedom laws inspired by the spread of gay marriage of forming an unholy alliance with the \u201c radical liberals. \u201d It \u2019 s not even his need to bask in the Robertsons \u2019 reflected glory .\nMore than any of that , his constituents are frustrated that their governor can \u2019 t be bothered to do his day job\u2014and when he does , that his actions are often transparently designed to build a national profile rather than meet Louisiana \u2019 s needs .\nThat \u2019 s clear in his refusal to take federal money to expand Medicaid\u2014which , of course , would mean acknowledging there are benefits to Obama \u2019 s health care law . But nowhere is it more obvious , or more damaging , than in Jindal \u2019 s stewardship of fiscal affairs .\nJindal chalks up the current budget shortfall to the drop in oil prices , and that \u2019 s definitely contributed . A larger piece of the puzzle has been his determination to maintain a pure record on taxes .\nJindal hasn \u2019 t always been reckless about taxation .

It was only after lawmakers seemed like they might eliminate the income tax entirely that he got on board with the rollback , and he soon was boasting that he \u2019 d signed the biggest tax cut in state history .\nThe first real glimpse of the future came in 2011 when Jindal fought tooth and nail against extending a temporary four-cent levy on the state \u2019 s cigarette tax\u2014at 36 cents , including the levy , the third lowest in the nation . His reasoning ? If the tax rate is scheduled to automatically drop and the state acts to prevent that from happening , it amounts to an effective tax increase .\nThe stance left his constituents cold , but impressed Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform ( ATR ) , who would endorse Jindal as Mitt Romney \u2019 s running mate the following year .\nThese days it \u2019 s hard to think of anyone who has as much influence over what Jindal \u2019 s willing to do than Norquist , whose rigid rules for what constitutes a tax increase line up perfectly with Jindal \u2019 s . In practice , that means the governor has insisted that the budget be balanced without tax increases , despite the prospect of devastating cuts to higher education and health care , the two main areas that don \u2019 t enjoy constitutional or statutory protection .\nAnd it means some revenue-enhancing ideas the Republican-dominated Legislature might support , specifically a reexamination of giveaways to specific industries , are off limits\u2014because eliminating a tax exemption without an offset that reduces another tax or cuts spending , according to ATR , is raising a tax .\nThat \u2019 s how the inventory tax wound up in everyone \u2019 s crosshairs , despite the fact that eliminating the rebate but not the underlying tax would hurt businesses , and getting rid of the tax would devastate some parishes ( that \u2019 s Louisiana for county ) .
