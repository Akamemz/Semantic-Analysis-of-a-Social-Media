    "content": "For at least the past four years David Brooks , the New York Times columnist , TV pundit , bestselling author and lecture-circuit thought leader , has been publicly talking and writing about humility . Central to his thesis is the idea that humility has waned among Americans in recent years , and he wants us to harken to an earlier , better time .\nOne of the key talking points ( if not the key talking point ) cited by Brooks in lectures , interviews , and in the opening chapter of his current bestseller , \u201c The Road to Character , \u201d is a particular set of statistics -- one so resonant that in the wake of the book 's release this spring , it has been seized upon by a seemingly endless number of reviewers and talking heads . There \u2019 s just one problem : Nearly every detail in this passage \u2013 which Brooks has repeated relentlessly , and which the media has echoed , also relentlessly -- is wrong .\nMy journey down the Brooks rabbit hole began around two years ago , when I was conducting research for my book \u201c Invisibles : Celebrating the Unsung Heroes of the Workplace. \u201d The book largely consists of long-form profiles of professionals who thrive behind the scenes , and a lot of time is spent positioning these people as counterpoints to our contemporary culture of attention . In setting a historical context , I argue that there has been a shift away from self-effacement toward one where gaining recognition seems to be prized above all else . It \u2019 s easy to see the dovetail with Brooks \u2019 premise about a shift from humility .\nSo it was that I came across video of a lecture he had given at the 2011 Aspen Ideas Festival , where he stated :\nIn 1950 the Gallup Organization asked high school seniors \u201c Are you a very important person ? \u201d And in 1950 , 12 percent of high school seniors said yes . They asked the same question again in 2006 ; this time it was n't 12 percent , it was 80 percent .\nThis seemed like a great stat to consider for my book , so I set about doing what I always aim to do when I come across a secondary source : I checked the facts . Before segueing to my current career as a writer , I spent about six or seven years as a magazine fact-checker , mostly for Cond\u00e9 Nast magazines ; seeking primary sources for facts is my default mode .\nI began by emailing a media contact at Gallup . After a series of exchanges , I was relayed to another Gallup employee . Ultimately I communicated directly with three different people at Gallup , and they communicated with multiple other staff , including a group in Princeton who combed Gallup \u2019 s print archives . During the process , a Gallup employee and I also emailed Brooks , but neither of us got a response . ( Granted , I didn \u2019 t expect one , given that I had emailed his New York Times address , which likely receives a torrent of messages daily . I assume Brooks has another , more private email address he actually uses . ) In their last email on the matter , the representatives at Gallup stated their final verdict : They did not \u201c have any record of the data \u201d that Brooks cited . But they also suggested that I try contacting Brooks again , and that if he shared any new information they would reopen the inquiry .\nIt was frustrating that they wouldn \u2019 t definitively just say Gallup didn \u2019 t conduct the polls Brooks cited , but if a number of people on the staff couldn \u2019 t find the polls then I knew either Gallup had atrocious record keeping , or Brooks was wrong . I hated that this tiny window of doubt was open , but there didn \u2019 t seem to be a path to find out one way or the other , so I gave up and didn \u2019 t include the passage in my book .\nFast forward to April 2015 , when I came across a review of \u201c The Road to Character \u201d in the New York Times Book Review . To my amazement , the same statistic from the Aspen talk , once again credited to Gallup , was paraphrased . And my obsession with the mysterious Gallup poll roared back to life .\nIt was one thing if Brooks made erroneous claims in a one-off lecture . It was something else entirely to put those same claims in a book . Now I had to get to the bottom of this . I wanted to fact-check the review to make sure the reviewer was accurately quoting from the book . I did a search on Google Books for part of the quote and found it . After that , I went to Barnes and Noble and looked up the passage in the actual book just to confirm it was there .\n`` In 1950 , the Gallup Organization asked high school seniors if they considered themselves to be a very important person . At that point , 12 percent said yes . The same question was asked in 2005 , and this time it wasn \u2019 t 12 percent who considered themselves very important , it was 80 percent . ''\nOver the course of my search I discovered other iterations of the passage as well : During a 2011 appearance on \u201c Real Time With Bill Maher , \u201d for example , Brooks tells the same exact story , except in this telling , the second study took place not in 2005 or 2006 , but in 1998 .\nThe NYT 's review of `` The Road to Character '' itself picked up the pattern of changing dates , when the reviewer noted that the passage in question was similar to one in an earlier Brooks book , \u201c The Social Animal , \u201d only it was written \u201c with slightly different dates . \u201d\n`` In 1950 a personality test asked teenagers if they considered themselves an important person . Twelve percent said yes . By the late 1980s , 80 percent said yes . ''\nSomehow , between the publication of `` The Social Animal '' in 2011 and the publication of `` The Road to Character '' in 2015 , a study that originally occurred , by Brooks ' telling , in `` the late 1980s '' became one that occurred nearly 20 years later . ( Amazingly , to the New York Times reviewer , the late 1980s and 2005 are only \u201c slightly different dates. \u201d And how was any difference in dates for the same citation , no matter how \u201c slight , \u201d not problematic to the Times reviewer ? )\nWhat began as a simple fact-check of a Gallup poll was devolving into a morass .\nI contacted Brooks ' publicist at Random House , and found the email address for a student at Yale who was thanked in the acknowledgments of `` The Road to Character '' as his fact-checker . The Yalie never replied , but I did get a response from his publicist , who told me that she had to check with Brooks , and that she would get back to me . It took over a week , but she replied with an admission that the study was wrongly ascribed to Gallup , but that the \u201c sociological trend is accurate. \u201d She also provided a link to what she said was the actual study ( \u201c Changes in Adolescent Response Patterns on the MMPI/MMPI-A Across Four Decades , \u201d an analysis by university scholars of various data sets ) , and said the passage would be corrected in future printings of the book .\nWhen I clicked the link and read the abstract , the first thing I noticed was the paper itself was published in 2003 . `` The Road to Character '' stated that the data set was from 2005 ; how could that be when the final published paper came out two years earlier ? That paper listed two relevant sets of data : One set collected in 1948 and 1954 , and another set from 1989 . I emailed Brooks ' publicist again . Had he merged the 1948 and 1954 polls into one that he then listed as having occurred in \u201c 1950 \u201d ? And what the hell was up with the 2005 date listed in `` The Road to Character '' ?\nI then contacted two of the authors of the paper , Cassandra Newsom , a professor of pediatrics , psychiatry , & psychology at Vanderbilt University , and Robert Archer , a professor of psychiatry at Eastern Virginia Medical School . Abstracts and studies in general can be a challenge for the layperson to read , as academic text is often as opaque as legalese . So they sent me the actual paper and I went through it over the phone with Newsom . Here \u2019 s where things really began to unravel .\nNewsom explained that , indeed , the first data set was from samples taken in 1948 and 1954 , not 1950 , and the second data set was from 1989 , not 2005 . Also , the first data set was exclusive to Minnesota , where respondents were disproportionately white , while the second was a more heterogeneous national sample . The respondents were not high school seniors , as Brooks wrote : In the \u2019 48 and \u2019 54 set , respondents were ninth graders ; the 1989 sample was composed of 14- to 16-year-olds . ( The \u2019 48 and '54 data set was later sifted to match the 1989 set by including only ninth graders who were aged 14-16 . ) Lastly , in the 1989 set , 80 percent of boys answered \u201c true \u201d to the statement \u201c I am an important person , \u201d and 77 percent of girls said true . Yet Brooks cited 80 percent as the only figure . I asked Newsom if it was possible that some other study was done in 2005 with the same \u201c I am an important person \u201d question . She said there has not been another normative sample since 1989 .\n( I emailed Brooks \u2019 publicist a third time , asking her to contact Brooks for clarification on the stream of additional apparent inaccuracies but never heard back . )\nThe thing I keep wondering is how did Brooks get nearly every detail of this passage wrong ? He said Gallup did the polls , when they were actually done by academics . He merged a data set from 1948 and 1954 into 1950 . He said the second data set was from 2005 , when it was from 1989 ( to me , the most damning and damaging inaccuracy ) . He said it was high school seniors , when it was ninth graders . And he said 80 percent answered true , when that was only so for boys . Can one accidentally get this many details wrong ?\nSo the question is , if it wasn \u2019 t an accident , why would Brooks deliberately falsify nearly every detail in a passage of his book , let alone one that is a cornerstone of the book \u2019 s P.R . campaign ? If you Google David Brooks and \u201c Gallup \u201d a vast scroll of media mentions of this erroneous passage appears . Brooks is a very talented writer , and whether you agree with him or not , he \u2019 s highly skilled at expressing ideas in compressed , digestible bites . After all , that is his job as an Op-Ed columnist . As I dug into the case , I watched the Aspen video again , while also referencing other lectures Brooks gave . Every time , he spoke with pith and humor ; the audiences laughed and cheered along with his jokes and likably nebbishy demeanor . The guy knows what works .\nAs his publicist suggested , he may be right about the general trend . So why did he feel the need to gild the lily ? Why couldn \u2019 t he have referenced the paper using the correct statistics ? Perhaps it is a sign of his skill as a communicator , and his weakness , to know how to make a passage particularly seductive . On `` Morning Joe , '' as one of the hosts recited the erroneous passage , another host waved a cellphone , signaling , \u201c See ? This is the problem with today \u2019 s youth ! \u201d Saying 1989 for the latter date wouldn \u2019 t quite work for that bit .\nIn addition to his factual errors , it \u2019 s worth noting that Newsom and Archer challenge Brooks \u2019 interpretation of their paper . Newsom explained to me that \u201c I am an important person \u201d was one question in a subset of questions related to \u201c Ego inflation. \u201d Interestingly , though this one question had a huge jump , ostensibly supporting the case of less humility over time , in fact , the overall subset that this question was a part of -- Ego Inflation -- had a relatively small increase from the first data set to the second . It \u2019 s generally not sound to spotlight one question in isolation , especially if it contrasts with the findings of the overall study or subset .\nOne reason is language itself . The words \u201c I am an important person \u201d may have been interpreted differently in the '40s and '50s , than in 1989 . Archer said that the early sample may have interpreted the item as meaning \u201c more important than others \u201d whereas the '80s sample may have read it to mean \u201c I believe I am a valuable person. \u201d Further , though the authors compare a sample from Minnesotans to a national sample , it \u2019 s done so in a paper intended to be read and interpreted by academics , who can weigh the discrepancy . Mainstream readers would likely benefit from knowing the samples are not apples to apples , as Brooks \u2019 citation implies .\nAs critical as the point of this paragraph and the previous one is , interpreting data is highly complex and not always an exact science and one could argue over what \u2019 s reasonable to include or exclude when referencing academic papers for a general audience ; the focus of this essay is on factual inaccuracies . ( But considering my intense spotlight on this passage , I \u2019 d be remiss to not at least mention the paper 's authors ' displeasure with Brooks ' cherry-picking a question out of context , drawing a misleading conclusion from it , and it becoming the lead sound bite in the media for a No . 1 bestselling book . )\nIt \u2019 s generally considered reasonable by fact-checkers and editors to allow for quotes from different sections of an interview to be merged , as long as the meaning behind them isn \u2019 t misrepresented . When you read quotes in an article , they \u2019 ve often been cleaned up for grammar , and the \u201c ums \u201d and tongue clucking that populate regular speech are generally deleted . But those changes are made with the intent of bringing clarity . Statistics , especially ones from scientific papers , need to stay precise and accurate . Changing them will almost always be construed as done in the name of persuasion . It \u2019 s a dangerous ploy to start fudging numbers and wordings from academic studies .\nHow did so many details from this passage change from one book to the next ? How did the late 1980s morph into 2005 , teenagers to high school seniors , and a personality test to the Gallup Organization ? It \u2019 s interesting that as the passage distanced itself further from the truth in its second iteration , it also became more specific in its details .\nI then watched the Aspen talk again and remembered something . I had another statistic from Brooks in my research notes for \u201c Invisibles. \u201d In the talk he said : \u201c In 2006 , 51 percent of 25 year-olds said that being famous was the most important life goal they could have. \u201d In `` The Road to Character , '' the text is massaged to : \u201c By 2007 , 51 percent of young people reported that being famous was one of their top personal goals . \u201d\nThe endnote in his book lists \u201c How Young People View Their Lives , Futures and Politics : A Portrait of \u2018 Generation Next ' ; The Pew Research Center for the People & the Press \u201d as the source . But the Pew survey itself reads : \u201c When asked not about themselves but about their generation , most 18-25 year-olds say getting rich and being famous are important goals for people in their age group. \u201d [ Emphasis mine . ]\nThis is a nuanced but critical difference . Young people were giving their impression of their generation , not observations of themselves personally . How we view our culture or a subset that we are a part of is , of course , not necessarily the same as how we view ourselves . Again , like the changes he made to the \u201c I am an important person \u201d passage , it \u2019 s worth noting that Brooks \u2019 revision of the language here , too , results in a more persuasive sound bite .\nWhat makes the case against mere catastrophic sloppiness is that , oddly , Brooks had the luxury of a fact-checker . Unfortunately , due to the expense , it \u2019 s rare for writers to have dedicated fact-checkers outside of high-end magazine journalism . Can every New York Times book reviewer be expected to fact-check any content they reprint or paraphrase ? ( Maybe not . But if you know a passage citing statistics is a repeat from an earlier book , but with different dates , probably , yeah . ) What about TV show hosts ? Even when writers have the best intentions , it is inevitable that errors will be introduced into their articles , and even more so books that are hundreds of pages long . We must ask , what errors , to a reader , are acceptable ?\nIn a recent Atlantic article the writer lamented that if there isn \u2019 t room today for a writer like Joe Mitchell -- a New Yorker scribe of yore who fabricated significant passages in his journalism -- \u201c The problem isn \u2019 t him-it \u2019 s us. \u201d But facts always matter . And if the writer is practicing some form of \u201c new \u201d journalism , then he should let the reader know , perhaps the way films use the \u201c inspired by \u201d disclaimer .\nThe question I keep wondering , and what I think perhaps is most relevant with Brooks , is why ? Why would someone with this level of prestige and influence be so woefully sloppy in his reportage \u2014 or worse ? Imagine yourself for a moment as an Op-Ed writer for the most influential newspaper in the world ; you get paid huge sums of money for a string of bestselling books , you entertain and enlighten live crowds at your lectures , you get paid to spout your opinions on TV . I don \u2019 t know what it would do to my head if I had the level of influence that Brooks has as a writer and cultural commentator . Perhaps , as a friend of mine suggested , maybe Brooks is just glib .\nUltimately , maybe it doesn \u2019 t even matter whether the passage was fudged on purpose or not . Perhaps to be so careless shows the same degree of culpability , and condescension toward the reader , that willful manipulation does .\nAs I was about to send the draft of this article to my editor I did a quick review again of \u201c The Road to Character \u201d on Google Books . To Brooks \u2019 publicist \u2019 s word , based on my email to her , future printings of the book , indeed , appear to be different . Now the passage reads :\n\u201c In 1948 , psychologists asked more than 10,000 adolescents whether they considered themselves to be a very important person . At that point , 12 percent said yes . The same question was asked in 2003 , and this time it wasn \u2019 t 12 percent who considered themselves very important , it was 80 percent . \u201d\nI was astonished . Even this \u201c correction \u201d isn \u2019 t correct ! Where is 1954 ? Where 's the 1989 ? In the interest of fact-checking , and a humility I assume Brooks would approve of , I should note , it is possible that a study was done in 2003 that had 80 percent of all respondents saying , `` Yes , it \u2019 s true , I am an important person . '' I \u2019 m still trying to find out .",
    "content_original": "For at least the past four years David Brooks, the New York Times columnist, TV pundit, bestselling author and lecture-circuit thought leader, has been publicly talking and writing about humility.

The Yalie never replied, but I did get a response from his publicist, who told me that she had to check with Brooks, and that she would get back to me. It took over a week, but she replied with an admission that the study was wrongly ascribed to Gallup, but that the \u201csociological trend is accurate.\u201d She also provided a link to what she said was the actual study (\u201cChanges in Adolescent Response Patterns on the MMPI/MMPI-A Across Four Decades,\u201d an analysis by university scholars of various data sets), and said the passage would be corrected in future printings of the book.\n\nWhen I clicked the link and read the abstract, the first thing I noticed was the paper itself was published in 2003. \"The Road to Character\" stated that the data set was from 2005; how could that be when the final published paper came out two years earlier?

Had he merged the 1948 and 1954 polls into one that he then listed as having occurred in \u201c1950\u201d? And what the hell was up with the 2005 date listed in \"The Road to Character\"?\n\nI did not receive a reply.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nI then contacted two of the authors of the paper, Cassandra Newsom, a professor of pediatrics, psychiatry, & psychology at Vanderbilt University, and Robert Archer, a professor of psychiatry at Eastern Virginia Medical School. Abstracts and studies in general can be a challenge for the layperson to read, as academic text is often as opaque as legalese. So they sent me the actual paper and I went through it over the phone with Newsom. Here\u2019s where things really began to unravel.\n\nNewsom explained that, indeed, the first data set was from samples taken in 1948 and 1954, not 1950, and the second data set was from 1989, not 2005. Also, the first data set was exclusive to Minnesota, where respondents were disproportionately white, while the second was a more heterogeneous national sample. The respondents were not high school seniors, as Brooks wrote: In the \u201948 and \u201954 set, respondents were ninth graders; the 1989 sample was composed of 14- to 16-year-olds. (The \u201948 and '54 data set was later sifted to match the 1989 set by including only ninth graders who were aged 14-16.) Lastly, in the 1989 set, 80 percent of boys answered \u201ctrue\u201d to the statement \u201cI am an important person,\u201d and 77 percent of girls said true. Yet Brooks cited 80 percent as the only figure. I asked Newsom if it was possible that some other study was done in 2005 with the same \u201cI am an important person\u201d question. She said there has not been another normative sample since 1989.\n\n(I emailed Brooks\u2019 publicist a third time, asking her to contact Brooks for clarification on the stream of additional apparent inaccuracies but never heard back.)\n\nThe thing I keep wondering is how did Brooks get nearly every detail of this passage wrong? He said Gallup did the polls, when they were actually done by academics. He merged a data set from 1948 and 1954 into 1950. He said the second data set was from 2005, when it was from 1989 (to me, the most damning and damaging inaccuracy). He said it was high school seniors, when it was ninth graders. And he said 80 percent answered true, when that was only so for boys. Can one accidentally get this many details wrong?\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nSo the question is, if it wasn\u2019t an accident, why would Brooks deliberately falsify nearly every detail in a passage of his book, let alone one that is a cornerstone of the book\u2019s P.R. campaign? If you Google David Brooks and \u201cGallup\u201d a vast scroll of media mentions of this erroneous passage appears. Brooks is a very talented writer, and whether you agree with him or not, he\u2019s highly skilled at expressing ideas in compressed, digestible bites. After all, that is his job as an Op-Ed columnist. As I dug into the case, I watched the Aspen video again, while also referencing other lectures Brooks gave. Every time, he spoke with pith and humor; the audiences laughed and cheered along with his jokes and likably nebbishy demeanor. The guy knows what works.\n\nAs his publicist suggested, he may be right about the general trend. So why did he feel the need to gild the lily? Why couldn\u2019t he have referenced the paper using the correct statistics? Perhaps it is a sign of his skill as a communicator, and his weakness, to know how to make a passage particularly seductive. On \"Morning Joe,\" as one of the hosts recited the erroneous passage, another host waved a cellphone, signaling, \u201cSee? This is the problem with today\u2019s youth!\u201d Saying 1989 for the latter date wouldn\u2019t quite work for that bit.\n\nIn addition to his factual errors, it\u2019s worth noting that Newsom and Archer challenge Brooks\u2019 interpretation of their paper. Newsom explained to me that \u201cI am an important person\u201d was one question in a subset of questions related to \u201cEgo inflation.\u201d Interestingly, though this one question had a huge jump, ostensibly supporting the case of less humility over time, in fact, the overall subset that this question was a part of -- Ego Inflation -- had a relatively small increase from the first data set to the second. It\u2019s generally not sound to spotlight one question in isolation, especially if it contrasts with the findings of the overall study or subset.\n\nOne reason is language itself. The words \u201cI am an important person\u201d may have been interpreted differently in the '40s and '50s, than in 1989. Archer said that the early sample may have interpreted the item as meaning \u201cmore important than others\u201d whereas the '80s sample may have read it to mean \u201cI believe I am a valuable person.\u201d Further, though the authors compare a sample from Minnesotans to a national sample, it\u2019s done so in a paper intended to be read and interpreted by academics, who can weigh the discrepancy. Mainstream readers would likely benefit from knowing the samples are not apples to apples, as Brooks\u2019 citation implies.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAs critical as the point of this paragraph and the previous one is, interpreting data is highly complex and not always an exact science and one could argue over what\u2019s reasonable to include or exclude when referencing academic papers for a general audience; the focus of this essay is on factual inaccuracies. (But considering my intense spotlight on this passage, I\u2019d be remiss to not at least mention the paper's authors' displeasure with Brooks' cherry-picking a question out of context, drawing a misleading conclusion from it, and it becoming the lead sound bite in the media for a No. 1 bestselling book.)\n\n* * *\n\nIt\u2019s generally considered reasonable by fact-checkers and editors to allow for quotes from different sections of an interview to be merged, as long as the meaning behind them isn\u2019t misrepresented. When you read quotes in an article, they\u2019ve often been cleaned up for grammar, and the \u201cums\u201d and tongue clucking that populate regular speech are generally deleted. But those changes are made with the intent of bringing clarity. Statistics, especially ones from scientific papers, need to stay precise and accurate. Changing them will almost always be construed as done in the name of persuasion. It\u2019s a dangerous ploy to start fudging numbers and wordings from academic studies.\n\nHow did so many details from this passage change from one book to the next? How did the late 1980s morph into 2005, teenagers to high school seniors, and a personality test to the Gallup Organization? It\u2019s interesting that as the passage distanced itself further from the truth in its second iteration, it also became more specific in its details.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nI then watched the Aspen talk again and remembered something. I had another statistic from Brooks in my research notes for \u201cInvisibles.\u201d In the talk he said: \u201cIn 2006, 51 percent of 25 year-olds said that being famous was the most important life goal they could have.\u201d In \"The Road to Character,\" the text is massaged to: \u201cBy 2007, 51 percent of young people reported that being famous was one of their top personal goals.\u201d\n\nThe endnote in his book lists \u201cHow Young People View Their Lives, Futures and Politics: A Portrait of \u2018Generation Next'; The Pew Research Center for the People & the Press\u201d as the source. But the Pew survey itself reads: \u201cWhen asked not about themselves but about their generation, most 18-25 year-olds say getting rich and being famous are important goals for people in their age group.\u201d [Emphasis mine.]\n\nThis is a nuanced but critical difference. Young people were giving their impression of their generation, not observations of themselves personally. How we view our culture or a subset that we are a part of is, of course, not necessarily the same as how we view ourselves. Again, like the changes he made to the \u201cI am an important person\u201d passage, it\u2019s worth noting that Brooks\u2019 revision of the language here, too, results in a more persuasive sound bite.\n\nWhat makes the case against mere catastrophic sloppiness is that, oddly, Brooks had the luxury of a fact-checker. Unfortunately, due to the expense, it\u2019s rare for writers to have dedicated fact-checkers outside of high-end magazine journalism. Can every New York Times book reviewer be expected to fact-check any content they reprint or paraphrase? (Maybe not. But if you know a passage citing statistics is a repeat from an earlier book, but with different dates, probably, yeah.) What about TV show hosts? Even when writers have the best intentions, it is inevitable that errors will be introduced into their articles, and even more so books that are hundreds of pages long. We must ask, what errors, to a reader, are acceptable?\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nIn a recent Atlantic article the writer lamented that if there isn\u2019t room today for a writer like Joe Mitchell -- a New Yorker scribe of yore who fabricated significant passages in his journalism -- \u201cThe problem isn\u2019t him-it\u2019s us.\u201d But facts always matter. And if the writer is practicing some form of \u201cnew\u201d journalism, then he should let the reader know, perhaps the way films use the \u201cinspired by\u201d disclaimer.\n\n* * *\n\nThe question I keep wondering, and what I think perhaps is most relevant with Brooks, is why? Why would someone with this level of prestige and influence be so woefully sloppy in his reportage \u2014 or worse? Imagine yourself for a moment as an Op-Ed writer for the most influential newspaper in the world; you get paid huge sums of money for a string of bestselling books, you entertain and enlighten live crowds at your lectures, you get paid to spout your opinions on TV. I don\u2019t know what it would do to my head if I had the level of influence that Brooks has as a writer and cultural commentator. Perhaps, as a friend of mine suggested, maybe Brooks is just glib.\n\nUltimately, maybe it doesn\u2019t even matter whether the passage was fudged on purpose or not. Perhaps to be so careless shows the same degree of culpability, and condescension toward the reader, that willful manipulation does.\n\nAs I was about to send the draft of this article to my editor I did a quick review again of \u201cThe Road to Character\u201d on Google Books. To Brooks\u2019 publicist\u2019s word, based on my email to her, future printings of the book, indeed, appear to be different. Now the passage reads:\n\n\u201cIn 1948, psychologists asked more than 10,000 adolescents whether they considered themselves to be a very important person. At that point, 12 percent said yes. The same question was asked in 2003, and this time it wasn\u2019t 12 percent who considered themselves very important, it was 80 percent.\u201d\n\nI was astonished. Even this \u201ccorrection\u201d isn\u2019t correct! Where is 1954? Where's the 1989? In the interest of fact-checking, and a humility I assume Brooks would approve of, I should note, it is possible that a study was done in 2003 that had 80 percent of all respondents saying, \"Yes, it\u2019s true, I am an important person.\" I\u2019m still trying to find out.",
