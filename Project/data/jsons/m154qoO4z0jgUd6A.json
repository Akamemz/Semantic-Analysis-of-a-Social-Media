General Assembly meeting in New York .\nIn his comments , Zarif sought to expose current strains between the Americans and the Saudis under Trump , who long has criticized U.S. wars in the Middle East .\nTrump \u2019 s close relationship with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been challenged by opponents following the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi last year in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul and the kingdom \u2019 s long , bloody war in Yemen . That country \u2019 s Houthi rebels claimed the oil field attack Saturday in Saudi Arabia , although the U.S. alleges Iran carried it out .\n\u201c I think it is important for the Saudi government to understand what they \u2019 re what they \u2019 re trying to achieve . Do they want to fight Iran until the last American soldier ? Is that their aim ? \u201d Zarif asked in a CNN interview . \u201c They can be assured that this won \u2019 t be the case ... because Iran will defend itself . \u201d\nAsked by the broadcaster what would be the consequence of a U.S. or Saudi strike , Zarif bluntly said : \u201c An all-out war . \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 m making a very serious statement that we don \u2019 t want war . We don \u2019 t want to engage in a military confrontation , \u201d he said . \u201c We believe that a military confrontation based on deception is awful . \u201d\nZarif , who was to travel to New York on Friday , added : \u201c We \u2019 ll have a lot of casualties , but we won \u2019 t blink to defend our territory . \u201d\nPompeo , who was in the United Arab Emirates , dismissed Zarif \u2019 s remarks , saying : \u201c I was here ( doing ) active diplomacy while the foreign minister of Iran is threatening all-out war to fight to the last American . \u201d\nPompeo said he hoped Iran would choose a path toward peace , but he remained doubtful . He described \u201c an enormous consensus in the region \u201d that Iran carried out the attack .\n\u201c There are still those today who think , \u2018 Boy , if we just give Iran just a little bit more money they \u2019 ll become a peaceful nation , \u2019 \u201d he said . \u201c We can see that that does not work . \u201d\nPompeo met Abu Dhabi \u2019 s powerful crown prince , Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan .

Australia , Bahrain and the United Kingdom also are taking part .\nThe U.S. formed the coalition after attacks on oil tankers that Washington blamed on Tehran , as well as Iran \u2019 s seizure of tankers in the region . Iran denies being behind the tanker explosions , although the attacks came after Tehran threatened to stop oil exports from the Persian Gulf .\nIraq said it would not join the coalition .
