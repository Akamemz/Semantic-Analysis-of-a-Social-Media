Here are four things the first-in-the-nation primary will tell us:\n\n1. How much damage did the last debate do to Marco Rubio?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nRubio came into New Hampshire with a head of steam. He quickly moved into second place in the polls, and there was even some hope he could overtake Donald Trump in the Granite State.

Does Donald trump need a ground game?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Charles Krupa/AP Charles Krupa/AP\n\nHe certainly did in Iowa, where his lead disappeared at the end. Trump has said he wasn't even familiar with the term \"ground game,\" but has now invested more in get-out-the-vote infrastructure in New Hampshire. Still, he is relying most on his own popularity \u2014 he's called himself \"the product\" \u2014 and his commanding lead in the polls. No poll has shown Trump's big lead in New Hampshire sliding, but New Hampshire voters are famous for making fools of pollsters \u2014 and front-runners.\n\n3. How badly wounded is Hillary Clinton?\n\nClinton expects to lose to Bernie Sanders. Tomorrow's results will tell us by how much. Margins matter. Her minuscule victory in Iowa gave her no momentum at all in New Hampshire. So a big, double-digit win for Sanders would give him a huge boost heading into next week's Nevada caucuses, where the Clinton campaign is hoping its union-based \"firewall\" is still strong.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption John Minchillo/AP John Minchillo/AP\n\nIf she can close the gap in New Hampshire \u2014 even by a little \u2014 and hold Sanders' lead to single digits, she will be able to boast that she pulled off a little bit of yet another Clinton comeback.\n\n4.
