It would be hard to make a better argument for including a broader range of right-leaning perspectives at mainstream publications than this recent , tone-deaf plea from New York magazine 's Eric Levitz to do just the opposite .\nResponding to The Atlantic 's much-discussed ( at \u2588\u2588\u2588 and elsewhere ) hiring and firing of conservative journalist Kevin Williamson over his comments about hanging women who have had abortions , Levitz makes note of a recent discussion about the Williamson affair between Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg and writer Ta-Nehisi Coates , the transcript of which was leaked to The Huffington Post . Goldberg claims to desire intellectual diversity at his publication\u2014though not if it means making women who work at The Atlantic and have had abortions feel unsafe\u2014and asked Coates whether he was concerned that narrowing the bounds of acceptable discourse would hurt the magazine :\nCoates : Again , I do n't think it 's a question of narrowing . I think it 's where the lines are drawn . Goldberg : Well , it is if you bring the lines in . Coates : Well , no , you open it up . You understand what I 'm saying ? Like , as I said before , I do n't think 15 years ago or 20 years ago we would have ran `` The Case For Reparations . '' So that means it 's opened up in a different direction . I think if we publish kick-ass stories , very little of this will actually matter .\nCoates was essentially saying that the publication could still have intellectual diversity without conservative opinions , as long as it shifted the goalpost in the other direction\u2014i.e. , by including more perspectives that were further and further left .\nLevitz takes this ball and runs with it , providing two basic arguments for doing so : first , most conservative opinion writers are completely irrelevant to the conservative movement as it exists the age of Trump ; and second , conservative arguments are obviously wrong and thus not worth debating at all .\nSocialist arguments , on the other hand , Levitz asserts , have yet to be debunked , and so mainstream magazines and op-ed pages would be well-served by hiring more advocates of such views . According to Levitz :\nThere are a lot of interesting questions that currently divide liberals from the socialist left . And exploring those disagreements would almost certainly do more to challenge the average Atlantic reader intellectually than running Kevin Williamson 's latest diatribe against the shiftless poor people he grew up among ( but proved himself better than ) . Take the most fundamental question dividing left-liberals from socialists : Should the means of production be socialized ?

It seems incoherent , though , to insist that Williamson-esque opinions like abortion is murder and should be dealt with as such and poor people bear much responsibility for their lot in life are uninteresting or beyond the pale while Joseph Stalin was on to something is not . To think that severe social conservatism is so kooky as to be un-printable , but Stalinism is at least debatable , requires a certain amount of unhealthy ideological blindness .
