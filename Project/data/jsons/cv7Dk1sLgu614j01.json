    "content": "Lawsuits demanding that stay-at-home orders be repealed have been filed this week in Maryland , Minnesota , and Nevada . In Michigan , a Family Dollar store security guard was shot after telling a customer to wear a face mask , which is mandated throughout the state for all retail stores . In Oklahoma , McDonald \u2019 s employees were shot at for asking customers to leave the dining area , which was closed due to coronavirus restrictions . Small but media-gobbling gatherings of armed protesters continue to gather , demanding that state stay-home orders be rescinded , using lethal weaponry to demonstrate a power their numbers can not convey . Members of the state Supreme Court in Wisconsin , hearing arguments in a case challenging the governor \u2019 s safer-at-home rules , invoked the language of \u201c tyranny \u201d and the Japanese internment to describe the current public health efforts to contain a pandemic . President Donald Trump has tweeted support for the armed militants ( \u201c These are very good people , but they are angry . They want their lives back again , safely ! \u201d ) and demanded the \u201c liberation \u201d of the states . Defiant public intellectuals embrace the general democratic principle that being a \u201c grandma killer \u201d is a small price to pay for resuming dentist visits and family trips to the zoo .\nIt \u2019 s certainly not the case that the federal Constitution protects everything you feel like doing , whenever you feel like doing it .\nThe words freedom and liberty have been invoked breathlessly in recent weeks to bolster the case for \u201c reopening. \u201d Protesters of state public safety measures readily locate in the Bill of Rights the varied and assorted freedom to not be masked , the freedom to have your toenails soaked and buffed , the freedom to open-carry weapons into the state capitol , the freedom to take your children to the polar bear cage , the freedom to worship even if it imperils public safety , and above all , the freedom to shoot the people who attempt to stop you from exercising such unenumerated but essential rights . Beyond a profound misunderstanding of the relationship between broad state police powers and federal constitutional rights in the midst of a deadly pandemic , this definition of freedom is perplexing , chiefly because it seems to assume not simply that other people should die for your individual liberties , but also that you have an affirmative right to harm , threaten , and even kill anyone who stands in the way of your exercising of the freedoms you demand . We tend to forget that even our most prized freedoms have limits , with regard to speech , assembly , or weaponry . Those constraints are not generally something one shoots one \u2019 s way out of , even in a pandemic , and simply insisting that your own rights are paramount because you super-duper want them doesn \u2019 t usually make it so .\nTo be sure , a good number of these \u201c protesters \u201d and \u201c pundits \u201d represent fringe groups , financed by other fringe groups and amplified by a press that adores conflict . The data continues to show that the vast majority of Americans are not out on the hustings fighting for the right to infect others for the sake of a McNugget . Also , it is not irrational in the least to fear a tyrannical government capitalizing on a pandemic ; it \u2019 s happening around the world . But even for those millions of people genuinely suffering hardship and anxiety , it \u2019 s simply not the case that all freedoms are the same . And it \u2019 s certainly not the case that the federal Constitution protects everything you feel like doing , whenever you feel like doing it .\nIn a superb essay by Ibram X. Kendi in the Atlantic this week , we \u2019 re reminded that there is a long-standing difference between core notions of what he calls freedom to and freedom from . The freedom to harm , he points out , has its lineage in the slaveholder \u2019 s constitutional notion of freedom : \u201c Slaveholders disavowed a state that secured any form of communal freedom\u2014the freedom of the community from slavery , from disenfranchisement , from exploitation , from poverty , from all the demeaning and silencing and killing. \u201d Kendi continues by pointing out that these two notions of freedom have long rubbed along uneasily side by side , but that those demanding that states \u201c open up \u201d so they may shop , or visit zoos , are peeling back the tension between the two :\nFrom the beginning of the American project , the powerful individual has been battling for his constitutional freedom to harm , and the vulnerable community has been battling for its constitutional freedom from harm . Both freedoms were inscribed into the U.S. Constitution , into the American psyche . The history of the United States , the history of Americans , is the history of reconciling the unreconcilable : individual freedom and community freedom . There is no way to reconcile the enduring psyche of the slaveholder with the enduring psyche of the enslaved .\nThe very idea that it doesn \u2019 t matter what happens to the larger community , so long as the individual has unfettered freedom to do as he pleases , is not just a vestige of the slaveholder ethos . As Charlie Warzel points out this week , this has been the core animating theory behind the American gun rights movement : reduce the debate to an absolutist fight about freedom that eventually narcotizes an entire population into believing that the cost of true liberty is tens of thousands of avoidable gun deaths each year . Any effort to regulate anything within the vast space between \u201c assault weapons for everyone on demand \u201d and \u201c reasonable gun safety \u201d is cast as a dire step toward tyranny . As Warzel puts it , this leads to another version of freedom to , in this case , the freedom to either do mass harm or the freedom to insist that nothing be done about it :\nThis idea of freedom is also an excuse to serve one \u2019 s self before others and a shield to hide from responsibility . In the gun rights fight , that freedom manifests in firearms falling into unstable hands . During a pandemic , that freedom manifests in rejections of masks , despite evidence to suggest they protect both the wearers and the people around them . It manifests in a rejection of public health by those who don \u2019 t believe their actions affect others . In this narrow worldview , freedom has a price , in the form of an \u201c acceptable \u201d number of human lives lost . It \u2019 s a price that will be calculated and then set by a select few .

Polls show that the majority of Americans are still deeply devoted to the proposition that their government can protect them from a deadly virus , and that they trust their governors and scientists and data far more than they trust the Mission Accomplished Industrial Complex that would have them valuing free-floating ideas about liberty over the health and indeed lives of essential workers , the elderly , and their own well-being , despite the president \u2019 s recent insistence that this is what , all of us , as \u201c warriors \u201d must do .

We will see attacks on people wearing masks and attacks on people lawfully asking others to wear masks . Some leaders will buckle under the pressure to rescind orders with claims that in choosing between liberty and death , they went with liberty . Others , like Michigan Gov . Gretchen Whitmer , will respond by insisting that the brandishing of guns inside the state Capitol is not , in fact , \u201c liberty , \u201d and that if it is liberty and justice , it is hardly liberty and justice for all , but rather for a small minority of people who seek to define freedom as something they will seize and threaten and even kill for . A good rule of thumb for COVID-based discussions about \u201c opening up \u201d is that if someone is demanding it while threatening to hurt or kill you , you are probably not as \u201c free \u201d as they are , and that their project does nothing to increase freedom in America and everything to hoard a twisted idea of freedom for themselves .\nWhen you hear someone demanding inchoate generalized \u201c freedom , \u201d ask whether he cares at all that millions of workers who clean the zoos and buff the nails and intubate the grandmas are not free .
