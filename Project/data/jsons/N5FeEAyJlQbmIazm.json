    "content": "Iowa 's largest newspaper is in the middle of a firestorm after publishing a report that dug up old , offensive tweets from a local man who raised over $ 1 million he then donated to charity .\nA piece published by the Des Moines Register profiled a 24-year-old Iowan native , Carson King , who became a TV sensation last weekend after he held up a sign at a football game asking people to donate money to him . He requested that they donate the funds through Venmo so he could buy his `` supply '' of Busch Light .\nKing went on to raise more than $ 1 million and donated the money to the University of Iowa 's Stead Children 's Hospital . Busch Light and Venmo pledged to match King 's fundraising efforts .\nThe newspaper report , however , included a `` routine background check '' of King 's social media history . Register reporter Aaron Calvin came across two racist jokes that dated back to 2012 when King was a 16-year-old high school student , `` one comparing black mothers to gorillas and another making light of black people killed in the Holocaust . ''\nKing was asked about the tweets and immediately expressed remorse .\n`` That \u2019 s not something that I \u2019 m proud of at all , '' King told the Register on Tuesday .\nHe appeared on local TV stations to apologize and said , `` I am embarrassed and stunned to reflect on what I thought was funny when I was 16 years old . ''\nNYT REPORTERS BEHIND KAVANAUGH STORY SUGGEST KEY INFORMATION WAS REMOVED BY EDITORS\nIn light of the tweets , Busch Light 's parent company , Anheuser-Busch InBev , announced that it was severing ties with King but promised to honor its pledge .\nAfter the piece was published Tuesday evening , critics slammed the Register for digging up the tweets .\nThe Register 's Executive Editor Carol Hunter issued a statement responding to the backlash and shed some light on the internal discussion about whether to include details about King 's social media posts .\n`` Should that material be included in the profile at all ? The jokes were highly inappropriate and were public posts . Should n't that be acknowledged to all the people who had donated money to King 's cause or were planning to do so ? '' Hunter wrote .\nHunter went on to defend the paper 's decision to include such information , noting that it was toward the bottom of the profile and not placed prominently at the top .\n`` The news conference was covered by local television stations , which first reported on the racist posts and King 's remorse . After those stories aired , Busch Light 's parent company announced it would honor its pledge to the children 's hospital but would sever future ties with King , '' Hunter continued . `` That happened before the Register published its profile of King , which was still in the editing process . ''\nWHO-TV 's Keith Murphy reported late Tuesday night that King found out at 2:16 p.m. local time that Busch Light was severing ties with him and that the press conference he held was n't until 7 p.m. , which appears to differ from Hunter 's claim that local television stations were the `` first '' to report about the tweets .\nThis also suggests that the tweets were brought to the beer company 's attention before King made public statements about them . And fingers were being pointed at the Register by critics .\nAfter the piece stirred up controversy on social media , critics then performed a `` routine background check '' on reporter Aaron Calvin 's social media footprint and found several insensitive tweets of his own .\nIn now-deleted tweets from 2010-2013 , Calvin repeatedly used the N-word , and wrote posts attacking law enforcement like `` f -- - all cops , '' and in reaction to the legalization of gay marriage said he 's `` totally going to marry a horse . ''\nBefore locking his Twitter account , Calvin issued an apology for his own tweets .\n`` Hey just wanted to say that I have deleted previous tweets that have been inappropriate or insensitive . I apologize for not holding myself to the same standards as the Register holds others , '' Calvin wrote .\nThe Register later tweeted that it was `` aware of reports of inappropriate social media posts '' by Calvin and an `` investigation has begun . ''\nCalvin and the paper did not immediately respond to \u2588\u2588\u2588 ' request for comment .\nDespite the uproar , King defended the paper and its reporter .\n`` The Des Moines Register has been nothing but kind in all of their coverage , and I appreciate the reporter pointing out the post to me , '' King tweeted . `` I want everyone to understand that this was my decision to publicly address the posts and apologize . I believe that is the right thing to do . ''\nIn a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588 , King expressed that he did n't want `` any of this negativity to hinder with the amazing work everyone has done for the hospital . ''",
