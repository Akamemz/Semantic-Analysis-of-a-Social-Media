    "content": "President Donald Trump addresses the daily coronavirus task force briefing at the White House , April 23 , 2020 . ( Jonathan Ernst/Reuters )\nThe president already had hurt himself politically by flirting with opponents of social distancing .\nNRPLUS MEMBER ARTICLE T he narrative is too simple to resist . In rambling remarks , Trump seemed to suggest using light and disinfectants inside the body to kill the coronavirus . His more uncharitable critics said Trump had suggested that Americans drink bleach . Trump responded that he was being sarcastic . Bleachgate , because it is such a great hook , risks symbolizing and distorting the causes of Trump \u2019 s relatively weak coronavirus bounce and the timing of that bounce \u2019 s fade . It didn \u2019 t start with drinking bleach .\nThe timing just doesn \u2019 t work out . Crises tend to produce rally-round-the-flag effects in which a national leader \u2019 s popularity improves as the public , in desperation and fear , puts its trust in him or her . That happened for Trump , too , but his initial polling bounce was smaller than for most other comparable national leaders . Relatively few Americans decided they wanted to rally around Trump .\nAnd even that small bounce had largely dissipated by the time Bleachgate broke on April 23 . Trump \u2019 s Real Clear Politics job approval average was 45.5 percent on February 7 . By April 22 , it was 45.8 percent . Using the FiveThirtyEight poll tracker , Trump \u2019 s job approval was 43.8 percent on February 7 and 43.6 percent on April 22 . Whatever bounce Trump had gotten , it was dead and buried before Bleachgate .\nBleachgate broke almost simultaneously with polling showing that Trump and Senate Republicans were faring poorly in swing states . Bleachgate , combined with the bad poll numbers , terrified Republican operatives , but Bleachgate could not have caused the bad poll numbers .\nWhat caused Trump \u2019 s rally-round-the-flag effect to be so feeble and transient ? Why has Trump \u2019 s party lost ground in Senate polling ? The timing doesn \u2019 t fit Bleachgate . An explanation that better fits the timing is that Trump \u2019 s flirtations with the diehard opponents of social distancing limited the upside of his bounce as he both associated himself with an overwhelmingly unpopular cause and appeared irresolute at a time when the public wanted steadiness .\nFrom the middle of March onward , state governors closed down businesses and restricted public gatherings in order to slow the spread of the coronavirus . From the beginning , there were those who opposed those mandated closings .\nWithin the media , Glenn Beck argued that even though the disease predominately killed the old , the elderly should be willing to go out and risk their lives for the health of the economy and America . Dennis Prager mocked the use of war metaphors in mobilizing against the virus , noting that in a war , people die and that an unwillingness to take risks was \u201c cowardice. \u201d He didn \u2019 t note that , in a war , one usually doesn \u2019 t mobilize to kill one \u2019 s own people , and that there are already many people taking many risks , even as tens of thousands of his countrymen are being killed by the disease .\nOther opponents of the lockdown were more oblique . The economists Stephen Moore and Arthur Laffer , along with former presidential candidate Steve Forbes , issued a four-point plan to deal with the economic consequences of the coronavirus . The third point was : \u201c Don \u2019 t expand welfare and other income redistribution benefits like paid leave and unemployment benefits that will inhibit growth and discourage work . \u201d\nThe diabolical genius of this policy was that it would have made the state lockdowns untenable by making it impossible for workers who were locked out of their jobs to survive . Presumably someone who was not a sociopath pointed out that Moore , Laffer , and Forbes weren \u2019 t fooling anybody and , the next day , the four-point plan became a three-point plan . But the Internet remembers .\nOn the political side , Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick of Texas went on television to argue against the lockdowns : \u201c And those of us who are 70-plus , we \u2019 ll take care of ourselves. \u201d Texas congressman Chip Roy decried the cost of the lockdowns and argued that President Trump was listening too much to health experts and should include \u201c economists , criminologists , psychologists , sociologists and primary care doctors \u201d on his coronavirus task force .\nThat was a reasonable point , though economists overwhelmingly favored the lockdowns . So did most people . One thing to keep in mind is that these were opponents and critics of the lockdowns at the earliest stage . The disease was still expanding exponentially . Testing was entirely inadequate . Absent sufficient testing , contact-tracing was impossible . There was no treatment . Personal protective equipment such as masks and gloves had disappeared from shelves .\nThese critics , arguing for abandoning social distancing at a time when workers and the elderly were the most vulnerable , were out of step with public opinion . A Fox News poll taken April 4\u20137 found that 80 percent of respondents favored a national stay-in-place order for nonessential workers ( a much more rigid policy than the state-by-state lockdowns that were then in effect ) . A Huffington Post/YouGov poll taken slightly later found that only 15 percent of respondents thought the lockdown restrictions were too strict . A USA Today poll found a slightly different margin , with only 69 percent favoring a nationwide stay-at-home order for nonessential workers . What bears repeating is that over two-thirds of the public favored a more restrictive approach than the status quo .\nBut while lockdown opponents were marginal among the American people , they were overrepresented among old-time conservative economists , Republican donors , and especially right-wing talk-show hosts . They would also find a sympathetic ear in the White House .\nOn March 22 , Steve Hilton , a Fox News weekend talk-show host and , at that moment , an opponent of the lockdowns ( he would soon change his mind ) , described the situation thus : \u201c You know that famous phrase \u2018 The cure is worse than the disease \u2019 ? That is exactly the territory we \u2019 re hurtling towards . \u201d\nWithin a few hours , Trump would adapt Hilton \u2019 s \u201c cure is worse than the disease \u201d to \u201c we can not let the cure be worse than the problem. \u201d Trump also began using talking points from anti-lockdown activists in comparing the coronavirus to the flu and car accidents . Trump also suggested that his administration would reexamine his recommendations on social distancing within 15 days .\nTrump also said a lot of other things . His language was vague and open-ended . He didn \u2019 t promise to end the lockdowns . He didn \u2019 t even assert that he had the power to end the lockdowns ( yet ) , but just as the lockdowns were starting , and as those lockdowns had overwhelming public support , Trump publicly wobbled on the policy , and he furthermore did it in a weasely manner as he tilted in the direction of the lockdown opponents without committing to a change . This wouldn \u2019 t be the last time Trump would triangulate between lockdown opponents and supporters .\nWhen anti-lockdown protests sprang up around the country , Trump tweeted \u201c Liberate \u201d while naming states that had Democratic governors . True to his style of signaling support for lockdown opponents while not committing to their position , Trump left himself deniability , but it was also obvious what was happening . He was also setting himself up for another political fail .\nThe same polls that showed the public overwhelmingly supported the lockdowns also showed that the public trusted their state governments more than they trusted Trump . Even Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer , whose capricious restrictions on shopping had brought down her approval ratings , still had the approval of 57 percent of her state .\nFurthermore , the anti-lockdown protests had the support of 22 percent of the public and were opposed by 60 percent . While the protesters did everything they could to appeal to conservatives with their Trump signs and MAGA hats , more Republicans opposed the protests than supported them . Trump had pulled off the trick of attacking people who were more popular than him on behalf of protesters who were less popular than him .\nAnd that leaves Trump \u2019 s infamous \u201c authority is total \u201d comment , wherein he claimed the authority to force state governors to reopen their states even if they didn \u2019 t want to do so . This not only made him look constitutionally illiterate but created a poisonous dynamic . His claim of authority made sense only as a threat to reopen states over the objections of their governors . The problem was that the governors were more trusted than Trump , the lockdowns were still popular , and Trump looked impotent and erratic because his words weren \u2019 t backed by action . It was a lose-lose-lose situation of his own creation .\nOne way to judge Trump is to look at how he compares with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu . Both are controversial , polarizing leaders , and Netanyahu has the additional disadvantage of being under indictment , but his party gained in the polls as a result of his handling of the coronavirus , while the Republicans languish .\nPerhaps an even better comparison would be with New York governor Andrew Cuomo and United Kingdom prime minister Boris Johnson . Johnson \u2019 s initial response to the coronavirus was a fiasco , as his government first tried to adopt a \u201c herd immunity \u201d strategy of keeping much of business open and then going to a lockdown after the virus was already raging through the country . Cuomo had the bad luck of presiding over a state that was seeded early by the coronavirus , but he was also slower to act than the governor of Washington \u2014 another state that was hit early . The result was that the infection spread much more widely in New York .\nTrump \u2019 s performance has been mixed , but he was early in limiting travel from China ( where the disease had originated ) .
