The changed politics of late-night TV\nThe curtain rose this week on a new era of late-night TV \u2014 altering the terrain for politicians who frequent the shows and complicating life for Republicans , who have lost their most comfortable seat in front of the camera .\n\u201c The whole landscape \u2019 s about to change , \u201d Arsenio Hall , the recently reincarnated late-night host , said in an interview . \u201c Jay [ Leno ] going home is going to change it for a lot of people . \u201d\nJimmy Fallon replaced Leno \u2014 who was seen as the one late-night host with a welcome mat out for the GOP \u2014 and moved \u201c The Tonight Show \u201d back to New York City after decades in Hollywood . Beyond the location , expect another big departure from Leno : Not nearly as many heavy-hitting political jokes or guests .\nFallon , who is eyed a bit warily by some Republicans , had first lady Michelle Obama on Thursday \u2014 they have a chemistry between them \u2014 after launching his new show on Monday . He said recently that his show will not be the place to go for in-depth interviews with politicians and candidates .\nObama and Fallon \u2019 s only foray into politics during her appearance was a pitch about Obamacare \u2019 s provision that allows children to stay on their parent \u2019 s health insurance until age 26 , with a quick quip from Fallon about the problem-plagued HealthCare.gov finally working .\n\u201c ( The website is ) working now . It \u2019 s so much better when it \u2019 s working , \u201d Fallon said .\nAs part of the new late-night lineup , Seth Meyers is taking over Fallon \u2019 s old spot on \u201c Late Night , \u201d and the former \u201c Saturday Night Live \u201d head writer has said he does plan to focus on politics . In fact , Vice President Joe Biden will be one of his first guests on Monday , when the show debuts . Meyers and his team declined an interview request .\nWith the 2014 midterms not far off and the 2016 presidential cycle already in motion , a seat on a late-night host \u2019 s couch is an important place for politicians who are looking to soften their image , reach a young-ish audience and prove they have a sense of humor like any average Joe .\nBut there will definitely be less pure politics without Leno , experts said . While Leno and \u201c Late Show \u201d host David Letterman have relied heavily on politics in their monologues and had many politicians on as guests , Fallon turns political only when there \u2019 s a story so big it can \u2019 t be ignored , said Robert Lichter , director of Center for Media and Public Affairs at George Mason University and the author of the forthcoming book \u201c Politics Is a Joke : How TV Comedians Are Remaking Political Life . \u201d\n\u201c [ Johnny ] Carson initiated political humor on late night , but Leno put it on steroids , \u201d Lichter said . \u201c Leno always told far more political jokes than anyone else . With folks like Fallon and others , you \u2019 ve got political humor when something big happens \u2026 so , for Fallon , politics is just one of many areas . For Leno , it was a major part of his arsenal . \u201d\nFallon \u2019 s slimmed-down diet of politics may not be a bad thing , said Erik Smith , Obama \u2019 s senior adviser for advertising and message development during the 2008 and 2012 campaigns . As opposed to what Smith called a \u201c sense of cynicism \u201d toward politics that Leno and Letterman exhibit in their monologues , Fallon \u2019 s skits and stunts \u2014 like the \u201c slow jam \u201d \u2014 bring out a softer side of a candidate and are more likely to go viral .\n\u201c The type of stuff Fallon does , from a [ political ] strategist point of view , will be a lot more helpful , because you \u2019 re actually showing a side of a politician most people can \u2019 t see , which is really fun , \u201d Smith said . \u201c When Obama slow-jammed with Fallon , he was talking about student loans . He got his message across . That was more effective than going on a talk show . \u201d\nSen. John McCain , one of the most prolific political late-night guests , said he often tries to encourage his fellow members of Congress to hit the late-night circuit but that it can be a hard sell .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve always encouraged my colleagues to go on as many of these shows as possible , because it \u2019 s a unique way to touch an audience that generally you never are able to reach under any other medium or format . And don \u2019 t think a lot of them aren \u2019 t scared , \u201d the Arizona Republican said in an interview .\nWhile the entertainment world has always had a liberal veneer , and the political leanings of the late-night hosts have been hotly debated for years , one thing seems clear : It is Republicans who will miss Leno most .\nCalling Leno his favorite late-night host , McCain said Leno would do little things like making sure there were cupcakes in the green room ( McCain \u2019 s favorite ) or show the senator around his car collection .\n\u201c That \u2019 s just the kind of guy he is , \u201d McCain said . \u201c Another reason I like him so much is he uses humor but he doesn \u2019 t have the sharp edge that some others do , the kind of put-down that is popular with some others . \u201d\nLongtime Republican strategist Mark McKinnon , who has advised the presidential campaigns of McCain and George W. Bush , said losing Leno is a loss to \u201c bipartisan political comedy . \u201d\n\u201c Conservative candidates are justifiably going to be more cautious about other [ late-night ] platforms , \u201d he said .\n\u201c Unlike other shows , specifically Letterman , Leno and his team always went out of their way to make candidates feel welcome and , more importantly , prepared . There were never any surprises , \u201d McKinnon added . \u201c The guests always knew ahead of time what they were likely to encounter on stage . And he and the writers were incredibly helpful suggesting scripts and ideas . And when male married candidates showed up with their spouses , they \u2019 d always have flowers for the wife . Very classy . Made candidates want to go back . \u201d\nRepublican consultant and pundit Mike Murphy said that it was partly Leno \u2019 s viewership that made GOP leaders feel more comfortable .\n\u201c I think because Jay \u2019 s audience skewed a bit older and more Midwestern , the usual older GOP leader type felt an affinity for him , but I don \u2019 t think Jay \u2019 s material was any easier on GOP than Democrats at all , \u201d Murphy said .\nAccording to Lichter \u2019 s analysis , Leno \u2019 s jokes from 2009-2013 were 49 percent about Democrats versus 51 percent about Republicans , although President Bill Clinton was his No . 1 target over his entire hosting career . Fallon , who told three times fewer political jokes than Leno in the same time period , hit Democrats in 59 percent of his political jokes versus 41 percent for Republicans , though Lichter notes that \u2019 s likely due to the scandals surrounding politicians like Anthony Weiner and Eliot Spitzer .\n\u201c Letterman particularly in recent years has gotten very one-sided , so if conservatives want to complain about late-night media bias , it \u2019 s Letterman and not Leno they had to worry about , \u201d Lichter said . \u201c I \u2019 m sure conservatives thought of Leno as more balanced , and our data bear that out to some degree . \u201d\nLetterman \u2019 s humor skewed heavily anti-Republican , Lichter found . From 2009 to 2013 , 71 percent of the late-night funnyman \u2019 s jokes were targeted at the GOP , versus 29 percent for Democrats .\nLast year , when news first surfaced that Leno was on his way out , conservative pundits lamented his possible exit , even though Leno has called himself a fiscal conservative but social liberal .\nAt the time , Matt Towery wrote on the conservative Town Hall website that Leno is like \u201c Barry Goldwater \u201d when compared with Letterman . \u201c \u2026 I know that Jay Leno , like most on network TV , is a self-proclaimed \u2018 liberal , \u2019 but I could care less . Next to David Letterman , he looks like Barry Goldwater , \u201d Towery wrote .\nIn his first monologue on Monday night , Fallon said he \u2019 d be targeting anyone and everyone for a laugh .\nBut Christian Toto , assistant editor at the conservative news site Breitbart , said Fallon \u2019 s track record \u201c isn \u2019 t promising in terms of being non-partisan . \u201d\nNoting Leno \u2019 s top ratings toward the end of his run , Toto said Leno understood the late-night rule of making fun of the president no matter the party . \u201c Leno was talking truth to power , and it was resonating , \u201d said Toto , who also oversees Breitbart \u2019 s Big Hollywood section .\nMichele Tasoff , Leno \u2019 s longtime political booker and producer , said the interviews were never \u201c cakewalks \u201d for politicians .\n\u201c It won \u2019 t be an easy interview ; Jay certainly has his opinions where one might stand on a particular topic or issue , but they know they \u2019 re going to get a fair shake , \u201d Tasoff said , noting that she had politicians tell her after the shows that they enjoyed the format and were appreciative of Leno letting them talk , unlike on cable news shows . \u201c I think that \u2019 s one reason why we \u2019 ve been successful in having so many notable politicians on the show . \u201d\nLetterman \u2019 s political booker and producer Mike Buczkiewicz said in an interview that even with Leno \u2019 s departure , he doesn \u2019 t expect much to change for pols and candidates .\n\u201c Politicians have always gravitated toward Dave , so I don \u2019 t think there \u2019 s going to be a massive change in that respect , \u201d Buczkiewicz said . \u201c I think Jay certainly had his handful of politicians on as well , but I don \u2019 t really see [ his departure ] affecting what we do here all that much . \u201d\nBuczkiewicz said that unlike the typical news show , Letterman offers politicians time to make their case .\n\u201c They \u2019 re lengthy interviews , so we give politicians time to stretch their legs a little bit ; this isn \u2019 t a 45-second cable hit , \u201d Buczkiewicz said . \u201c With the amount of outlets politicians go to , Dave sets himself apart from the rest with the ability to have fun with them , talk with them about world hunger or serious issues that I think on first glance people would look at a subject and say , \u2018 Oh my , you can \u2019 t talk about that on late night \u2019 ; well , Dave can do that . \u201d\nHall said there \u2019 s an obvious difference in interview styles between the hosts in the late-night landscape , but that each one is \u201c brilliant in their own way . \u201d\n\u201c I love sitting and watching Letterman talk with Barack Obama , the way he did it , the way he paced it , the questions he asked , the conversational manner he did it in , \u201d Hall said . \u201c But I think the great thing about it , Fallon is totally different . If you \u2019 re a Fallon viewer , you like his style and how he approached it . Letterman doesn \u2019 t slow jam the news , but it was equally an exciting and meaningful appearance . You choose a host who executes the interviews and the show you want to see . \u201d\nFallon , who declined an interview request from \u2588\u2588\u2588 , may grow into having more political guests as he settles into his new role , Lichter predicted .\n\u201c When you \u2019 re trying to build buzz for a new host , having your stuff repeated in politically oriented news is going to get it out to a wider audience . So let \u2019 s see if Fallon remains what he has been or if he tries to use some of the things Leno led the way on , even if he doesn \u2019 t go as far as Leno did , \u201d Lichter said . \u201c Fallon isn \u2019 t particularly good or interested in interviewing big-name politicians . But if you have presidential candidates going on the other shows and not on your show , you may have a problem , whether you like it or not . \u201d",

From 2009 to 2013, 71 percent of the late-night funnyman\u2019s jokes were targeted at the GOP, versus 29 percent for Democrats.\n\nLast year, when news first surfaced that Leno was on his way out , conservative pundits lamented his possible exit, even though Leno has called himself a fiscal conservative but social liberal.\n\nAt the time, Matt Towery wrote on the conservative Town Hall website that Leno is like \u201cBarry Goldwater\u201d when compared with Letterman. \u201c\u2026 I know that Jay Leno, like most on network TV, is a self-proclaimed \u2018liberal,\u2019 but I could care less. Next to David Letterman, he looks like Barry Goldwater,\u201d Towery wrote.\n\nIn his first monologue on Monday night, Fallon said he\u2019d be targeting anyone and everyone for a laugh.\n\nBut Christian Toto, assistant editor at the conservative news site Breitbart, said Fallon\u2019s track record \u201cisn\u2019t promising in terms of being non-partisan.\u201d\n\nNoting Leno\u2019s top ratings toward the end of his run, Toto said Leno understood the late-night rule of making fun of the president no matter the party. \u201cLeno was talking truth to power, and it was resonating,\u201d said Toto, who also oversees Breitbart\u2019s Big Hollywood section.\n\nMichele Tasoff, Leno\u2019s longtime political booker and producer, said the interviews were never \u201ccakewalks\u201d for politicians.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be an easy interview; Jay certainly has his opinions where one might stand on a particular topic or issue, but they know they\u2019re going to get a fair shake,\u201d Tasoff said, noting that she had politicians tell her after the shows that they enjoyed the format and were appreciative of Leno letting them talk, unlike on cable news shows. \u201cI think that\u2019s one reason why we\u2019ve been successful in having so many notable politicians on the show.\u201d\n\nLetterman\u2019s political booker and producer Mike Buczkiewicz said in an interview that even with Leno\u2019s departure, he doesn\u2019t expect much to change for pols and candidates.\n\n\u201cPoliticians have always gravitated toward Dave, so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be a massive change in that respect,\u201d Buczkiewicz said. \u201cI think Jay certainly had his handful of politicians on as well, but I don\u2019t really see [his departure] affecting what we do here all that much.\u201d\n\nBuczkiewicz said that unlike the typical news show, Letterman offers politicians time to make their case.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re lengthy interviews, so we give politicians time to stretch their legs a little bit; this isn\u2019t a 45-second cable hit,\u201d Buczkiewicz said. \u201cWith the amount of outlets politicians go to, Dave sets himself apart from the rest with the ability to have fun with them, talk with them about world hunger or serious issues that I think on first glance people would look at a subject and say, \u2018Oh my, you can\u2019t talk about that on late night\u2019; well, Dave can do that.\u201d\n\nHall said there\u2019s an obvious difference in interview styles between the hosts in the late-night landscape, but that each one is \u201cbrilliant in their own way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love sitting and watching Letterman talk with Barack Obama, the way he did it, the way he paced it, the questions he asked, the conversational manner he did it in,\u201d Hall said. \u201cBut I think the great thing about it, Fallon is totally different. If you\u2019re a Fallon viewer, you like his style and how he approached it. Letterman doesn\u2019t slow jam the news, but it was equally an exciting and meaningful appearance. You choose a host who executes the interviews and the show you want to see.\u201d\n\nFallon, who declined an interview request from POLITICO, may grow into having more political guests as he settles into his new role, Lichter predicted.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to build buzz for a new host, having your stuff repeated in politically oriented news is going to get it out to a wider audience. So let\u2019s see if Fallon remains what he has been or if he tries to use some of the things Leno led the way on, even if he doesn\u2019t go as far as Leno did,\u201d Lichter said. \u201cFallon isn\u2019t particularly good or interested in interviewing big-name politicians. But if you have presidential candidates going on the other shows and not on your show, you may have a problem, whether you like it or not.\u201d",
