ET on Thursday , as the first leaks of the fired FBI director 's explosive new book started gushing out .\nProving that revenge is a dish best served cold , Comey waited 11 months to exact his retribution for his dismissal by President Donald Trump last May . When it came it was unsparing , richly detailed and mortifying for the President .\nHe painted Trump as a relentless liar who is obsessively unethical , devoid of humanity and a slave to his ego , who is clueless about his job and unconcerned about a Russian assault on American democracy .\nJabbing the President in a strikingly personal way , Comey noted the size of Trump 's hands , said his skin looked orange and described white rings around his eyes from tanning goggles .\nBut Comey is n't just out to hurt Trump 's feelings . He is on a more profound mission : His book is a parable about the threat from a brazen President who demands a warped concept of loyalty and has only disdain for the rule of law .\n`` Hell hath no fury like an FBI director scorned , '' former Trump economic adviser Stephen Moore said on CNN .\nCNN obtained a copy of the book and corroborated news reports about Comey 's highly anticipated recounting of his time in the Trump administration .\nIn one staggering part of the book , `` A Higher Loyalty , '' Comey said dealing with Trump reminded him of his days prosecuting Mafia kingpins with their `` silent circle of assent .

It is not fake news . It is not okay , '' he writes , sketching a brutal , feudal world that seems incompatible with traditional perceptions of the presidency .\nTrump lashed out at Comey in a tweet on Friday morning , living up to his creed of swift retaliation .\n`` James Comey is a proven LEAKER & LIAR .

' I 'm a flawed human being , but there is literally zero chance that my wife would think that was true . So , what kind of marriage to what kind of man does your wife think ( that ) there 's only a 99 percent chance you did n't do that ?

But there 's little chance it will loosen Trump 's unshakeable hold on his political support base , which tends to view such media storms as more proof that the establishment is biased against Trump .\nMaterial in the book suggests , however , that Comey , who has already spoken to Mueller 's investigators , will be a crucial witness as the special counsel considers whether the President obstructed justice .\nIn the book , Comey repeats his claim that Trump asked if he could go easy on former national security adviser Michael Flynn , which he revealed in congressional testimony last year .
