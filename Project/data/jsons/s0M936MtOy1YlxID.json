How many , they won \u2019 t say . What happens if that \u2019 s not enough , no one seems to fully know .\nObama \u2019 s been talking about getting an Iran deal since he first ran for president in 2008 and taking heat for it from the beginning . In year seven of his presidency , it has emerged as a key lingering piece of the transformational foreign policy he wants as his legacy and become central to dealings across a region where every week brings a new crumbling country , each with a new kaleidoscope of shifting alliances to deal with .\nObama \u2019 s decision to back down from the threat of strikes on Syria in 2013 is still seen as revealing Obama \u2019 s unwillingness to fight by many of the same regional leaders who fear he \u2019 s willing to give away too much to get an agreement now .\nAn Iran deal , in the White House \u2019 s view , simultaneously has no direct connection to the rest of the trouble in the Middle East and is inextricably tied to everything the administration is facing . That includes a fractured relationship with the Israeli prime minister who , along with the Saudis , is strongly opposed to the Iran talks ; the United States and Saudi Arabia backing the rebels in Syria while Iran backs Bashar Assad ; the Houthis in Yemen against Al Qaeda while the Saudis attack ; all while Americans and Iranians align to fight off Islamic State in Iraq .\n\u201c If a deal happens , even in overtime , that is a meaningful contribution to Middle East security . Period . There is uncertainty about Iran \u2019 s long-term trajectory and its interests in places like Yemen , Syria and Iraq . The region as a whole is concerned about Iran , and rightfully so .

Going a couple of days past the deadline , goes the thinking , would be a lot different than going two weeks , and not just because Congress will be back in session by then .\nThe broader narrative of instability in the region is already problematic , the White House knows , and failing to get an agreement after all this buildup would make that worse .\nThey also know that it \u2019 ll be hard to claim a win even if they somehow squeak out a deal that Obama considers a good one . Any excitement will be drowned out by all other instability in the region and by the people in Congress and around the world who will attack any agreement .\nIt \u2019 s not like Obama was ever planning an Iran talks victory tour . The best case that the administration was expecting was for Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry to be cautious downers while the Europeans popped the corks on another uncertain win for international diplomacy .\nBut beyond repeating their clich\u00e9 that \u201c no deal is better than a bad deal , \u201d there \u2019 s no sense of what getting no Iran deal would mean , or what Obama \u2019 s prepared to do if there isn \u2019 t one .\nAll of this comes as the administration is grappling with the reality of Tehran asserting itself in Syria , Iraq and Yemen , on top of its long-held presence in Lebanon through Hezbollah .
