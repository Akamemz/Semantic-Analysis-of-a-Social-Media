And tyranny is when we , you restrict the liberty of people who are healthy , '' says Muise .\nMuise alleges that Whitmer has violated the First Amendment by banning church services , the Second Amendment by closing gun stores , and the 14th Amendment 's Equal Protection Clause by seeming to arbitrarily allow some places to stay open while banning others . One of his clients is a landscaper whom he says was perfectly capable of running his business while maintaining social distancing .\nThe American Freedom Law Center has also filed a First Amendment lawsuit against New York Mayor Bill de Blasio , who has banned protests but permits walking and jogging .\n`` This is a total ban on first amendment activity , '' says Muise .\nJosh Blackman , an associate professor of law at the South Texas College of Law Houston ( and contributor to The Volokh Conspiracy , which is published here at \u2588\u2588\u2588.com ) , says that while the emergency orders may have been legal early on , they can become less constitutional as new information about the threat level and the effectiveness of the policy becomes clear .\n`` If the elected branches say there 's some crisis that 's going on , the courts are hesitant to second-guess that , '' says Blackman . `` But I think that deference only lasts for so long\u2026.Measures that might have seemed necessary and proper months ago , now seem , perhaps , [ like ] overkill .

''\nBlackman points to a recent Texas Supreme Court opinion finding that as the threat lessens the `` continued burdens on constitutional liberties may not survive judicial scrutiny .
