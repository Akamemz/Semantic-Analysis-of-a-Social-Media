    "content": "The New York Times edited a controversial passage in an article about a sexual assault allegation against former vice president Joe Biden after his campaign complained , the paper 's executive editor said Monday .\nDean Baquet , in an interview with Times media columnist Ben Smith , explained why edits were made to the following sentence , which appeared as follows in the print edition of the paper , on page A20 : `` The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden , beyond the hugs , kisses and touching that women previously said made them uncomfortable . ''\nBaquet said the Times decided to delete the second half of the sentence , without explanation in the form of an editor 's note , because `` the [ Biden ] campaign thought that the phrasing was awkward and made it look like there were other instances in which he had been accused of sexual misconduct . ''\nSmith asked a number of questions challenging Baquet to defend the Times \u2018 s excessively cautious approach to reporting the sexual assault allegation against Biden\u2014first made public by a former staffer , Tara Reade , on March 25\u2014in light of the paper 's decidedly more aggressive approach to publishing similar allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh .\nBaquet failed to muster a coherent response beyond noting that the standard for reporting on such allegations is `` very subjective . '' He explained that the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings in 2018 , which included testimony from a woman , Christine Blasey Ford , who accused him of sexually assaulting her in high school , constituted a `` hot story '' that required a `` different news judgement . ''\nKavanaugh vehemently denied Ford 's allegation , and the Times did not interview anyone who recalled Ford telling them about the alleged incident at the time . Baquet , in the interview with Smith , cited the importance of `` contemporaneous '' conversations in determining the credibility and newsworthiness of sexual assault allegations . Like he said , the standard is `` very subjective . ''\nBaquet also defended the Times \u2018 s decision to immediately publish Julie Swetnick 's allegations against Kavanaugh . Swetnick , a client of former attorney and convicted felon Michael Avenatti , accused Kavanaugh of gang rape at frat parties . She turned out to be about as credible as her attorney . But the Times chose not to spend two weeks investigating her claims , Baquet said , because Kavanaugh `` was already in a public forum in a large way '' and had become `` the biggest political story in the country . '' Apparently the same can not be said of Joe Biden or the 2020 presidential election .",
