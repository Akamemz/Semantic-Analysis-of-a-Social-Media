Labels such as \u201c far-right \u201d and \u201c alt-right , \u201d which once might have served to strip a person of his or her livelihood and personal reputation , have become such common terms of abuse that they \u2019 ve effectively become meaningless . The words \u201c white nationalist \u201d once were used to describe someone who actually supported the creation of a white ethnostate . But now , activists are claiming that the mere act of making an \u201c okay \u201d hand gesture could mark you as a \u201c white power \u201d extremist\u2014or at least someone who is \u201c alt-right-adjacent. \u201d The goal of this perversion of language is to drive up the number of people who may be classified out of hand as extremists , and thereby disqualify even the mildest forms of dissent as de facto hate speech .\nAs a visible minority , I \u2019 ve experienced my share of prejudice and ignorance . I don \u2019 t deny that racism exists and that it is repugnant . But the solution is not to divide society into ideological factions , with one side being publicly shamed and banished , while the other is given carte blanche to promote its own , increasingly fanatical , intersectional doctrines .\nThe theory of intersectionality , now widely embraced by self-described feminist activists , maintains that non-whites , women , and LGBT individuals face systemic oppression whose scope increases according to the number of minority statuses a person holds . The fewer boxes you check ( straight white men don \u2019 t check any ) the more \u201c privilege \u201d you are deemed to possess . This privilege , which now serves as a sort of intersectional mark of Cain , is invoked to justify reverse racism ( though a true intersectionalist would argue that this is a misuse of the word \u201c racism , \u201d since the term only may be applied in regard to the mistreatment of a so-called \u201c person of color \u201d ) .\nBut there is a price being paid for this belief system\u2014retaliation from those who understandably don \u2019 t appreciate being the subject of discrimination . A recent study in Political Psychology\u2014a journal dedicated to the \u201c psychological aspects of national and international political developments \u201d \u2014discussed this growing \u201c whitelash \u201d ( or white backlash ) , and the underlying psychological reasons why individuals hold white nationalistic views .\nIn a sample of over 15,000 New Zealand registered voters , the researchers found , perceptions of group-based deprivation ( that is , the belief that one \u2019 s own ethnic group is losing out due to policies that help other groups ) were associated with increased feelings of nationalism ; and that nationalistic beliefs increased the psychological wellbeing of those who felt that they were being deprived . \u201c What our model shows , for the first time , is that it is possible for a group to feel unfairly treated within a larger political entity ( in this case , the nation ) and simultaneously identify strongly with that entity , \u201d the authors write . \u201c One reason why this might be the case is that nationalism buffers well-being against the negative psychological consequences of perceiving one \u2019 s group to be deprived . These findings imply that the rise of nationalism in white-majority countries might be , in part , a reaction to a perceived loss of ingroup status . \u201d\nThe term \u201c intersectionality \u201d doesn \u2019 t appear in the paper .

Ending discrimination against minorities shouldn \u2019 t require promoting intolerance against the majority .
