    "content": "James Comey will deliver bombshell testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday morning , that much is clear . He will present a disturbing and detailed account of his interactions with Donald Trump .\n\u201c I need loyalty , I expect loyalty , \u201d Trump allegedly said to Comey , according to the former FBI director \u2019 s prepared remarks released on Wednesday .\nTrump \u2019 s firing of Comey in May was suspicious for several reasons . Most obviously , it occurred against the backdrop of a looming federal investigation into the ties between Russia and Trump \u2019 s campaign , and even though Trump said at the time that he fired Comey over his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton \u2019 s emails , basically no one believes this , particularly because Trump himself undermined this argument days later in an interview with NBC \u2019 s Lester Holt .\nComey \u2019 s testimony is telling \u2014 not only did Trump demand \u201c loyalty \u201d and \u201c honest loyalty \u201d from Comey , but he also asked what the FBI director could do to \u201c lift the cloud \u201d of the investigation . But do Trump \u2019 s actions amount to obstruction of justice ? And what does obstruction of justice mean in this context ?\nI asked six constitutional and criminal law experts to think through these questions .\n\u201c The [ Michael ] Flynn matter surely confirms that he wanted the investigation closed , \u201d Joshua Dressler , a law professor at Ohio State University , told me after reading Comey \u2019 s prepared remarks . \u201c But it remains ambiguous whether Trump \u2018 endeavored \u2019 to impede the investigation , \u201d which is necessary in order to meet the obstruction of justice threshold .\nFor Jimmy Gurul\u00e9 , a law professor at the University of Notre Dame , Comey \u2019 s statements are more damning : \u201c It is difficult to construe President Trump 's statements on February 14 to former FBI Director Comey as anything other than a request to terminate the FBI investigation of Gen. Flynn for reasons other than the merits of the case . This is an attempt to endeavor and influence the due administration of justice under the federal obstruction of justice statute . \u201d\nComey \u2019 s testimony will doubtless be just the beginning of discussions over whether Trump committed the crime that forced President Richard Nixon to resign .\nObstructing justice seems straightforward : an attempt to impede or undermine a criminal investigation . But there are some important caveats .\n\u201c It requires proof that the person corruptly or by threat influences , impedes , or endeavors to influence or impede the due administration of justice , \u201d Dressler says . \u201c It does n't require proof that justice was obstructed \u2014 only that the person endeavored to influence or impede justice . \u201d\nIn other words , one needn \u2019 t succeed at obstructing justice to be guilty of it . It \u2019 s enough to prove that someone deliberately sought to hinder an investigation . The problem is that intent is often difficult to prove , especially in a circumstance where there are multiple contradictory motives .\nMark Tushnet , who teaches constitutional law at Harvard , offered an even simpler definition : \u201c doing something that corruptly interferes with an ongoing investigation ... or doing something that makes it harder for the prosecutor to prove that you committed a crime. \u201d Corrupt intent means \u201c specifically wanting to derail an investigation , to prevent it from reaching what otherwise would be its conclusion . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s also worth remembering , according to Brandon Garrett , a law professor at the University of Virginia , that \u201c there is a whole family of obstruction of justice statutes ; it 's not just one crime , and many of them overlap . \u201d\n\u201c In general , \u201d he continued , \u201c obstruction of justice is broadly defined as corruptly influencing or impeding a federal proceedings. \u201d What actually counts as a \u201c federal proceeding \u201d remains a matter of controversy , and one that bears heavily on this case .\nWe don \u2019 t yet know if there was a grand jury hearing concerning the Russia investigation . If there was , Trump almost certainly obstructed justice . If , however , there was only a FBI investigation , Garrett and others I spoke with agree it \u2019 s not clear that obstruction of justice charges are applicable .\nBut setting aside that dispute , the plainest legal definition of obstruction of justice is something like this : acting with the specific intent to interfere with a judicial proceeding .\nHow strong is the case that Trump obstructed justice based on what we already know ?\nThere isn \u2019 t an easy answer to this question . Part of the reason is that we don \u2019 t have all the facts . But it \u2019 s also because of varying views on the powers of the executive .\nEric Posner , a professor of law at the University of Chicago , pointed out that if \u201c the president is head of law enforcement in this country , and if the president is the head of law enforcement , then he has the authority to hire and fire and to tell his subordinates not to pursue certain investigations . \u201d\nBut there are compelling counter-arguments to this : Gurul\u00e9 , who also served as assistant attorney general for George H.W . Bush and undersecretary of the Treasury for enforcement under George W. Bush , insists that the constitutional right to hire and fire is not absolute .\n\u201c There \u2019 s no constitutional right to hire and fire that is without exception , \u201d he told me .\nGurul\u00e9 also sees at least three instances in which the president arguably violated obstruction of justice laws . The first is the actual firing of Comey . \u201c If it \u2019 s clear that this was done with the aim of interfering with the investigation , that \u2019 s obstruction of justice . \u201d\nThe second instance has to do with Trump \u2019 s conversations with Comey . \u201c We know that the president asked Sessions and others to leave the room so that he could talk privately with Comey , \u201d Gurul\u00e9 says . \u201c If the president urged Comey to back off Flynn , or even if he expressed his desire to see Flynn left alone , that strikes me as endeavoring to influence or obstruct the due administration of justice . \u201d\nStill , the question of intent remains . But if it \u2019 s true that this conversation occurred as reported and as Comey details , it would appear that the president wanted Comey to make a decision regarding the investigation based on something other than the merits of the case \u2014 and that \u2019 s obstructing justice by any reasonable standard .\nThe third potential instance of obstruction is Trump \u2019 s alleged conversation with Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats . According to the Washington Post , Trump asked Coats in March \u201c if he could intervene with then-FBI Director James B. Comey to get the bureau to back off its focus on former national security adviser Michael Flynn in its Russia probe. \u201d As with the Comey interactions , the whiff of obstructionism is strong here .\nThese are all discrete cases , Gurul\u00e9 says , and they shouldn \u2019 t be conflated . Even if there \u2019 s a sound justification for Comey \u2019 s firing , \u201c that doesn \u2019 t pertain at all to the conversation between Trump and Comey or between Trump and Coats . \u201d\nParticularly if the prospect of impeachment is in question , whether Trump committed obstruction of justice is relevant , but that doesn \u2019 t necessarily make it more or less likely to happen . Ultimately , as Christopher Slobogin , a professor of criminal law at Vanderbilt University , told me , \u201c Congress gets to decide what constitutes a high crime and misdemeanor for impeachment purposes . \u201d\nWhich is to say , even if Trump did obstruct justice , he will not be impeached unless a Republican-controlled Congress decides he ought to be .\nWhat legal experts might look for in Comey \u2019 s testimony on Thursday\nSome new facts may be revealed when Comey delivers not only his opening remarks but also his answers to questions from senators . Comey will also do a closed-door briefing following the public testimony . Legal experts were nearly unified in what they said they might be looking for .\nEric Posner was focused on \u201c the reasons for Trump 's firing of Comey and the relative weight he gave those reasons. \u201d If Comey can speak to Trump \u2019 s intent , that will go a long way in determining whether justice was obstructed . Again , though , Posner cautioned : \u201c We \u2019 ll probably learn that a whole host of factors drove Trump \u2019 s decision , and if so , it will be difficult to determine intent . \u201d\nThe language Comey uses is critical for Christopher Slobogin . \u201c If Trump merely said he \u2018 hoped \u2019 the investigation would end , that might not be construed as impeding . If he said in the context of talking about the investigation that Comey should pledge loyalty to Trump , that would probably be impeding . \u201d\nIt really matters , then , what Trump actually said to Comey . If Trump insisted that Flynn was a \u201c good guy \u201d who shouldn \u2019 t be harassed , that doesn \u2019 t meet the obstruction threshold . \u201c Even if he wanted the investigation shut down or curtailed because he thought it was a waste of time , \u201d Slobogin says , \u201c it might not be improper . \u201d\nComey has to confirm or at the very least suggest that Trump wanted to avoid discovery of misdeeds \u2014 by him or by his staff \u2014 in order to have obstructed justice .\nMark Tushnet echoed Slobogin \u2019 s answer . \u201c Any indication of reasons that Trump gave for asking Comey to go easy on Flynn will be vitally important , \u201d he told me . \u201c The specific language is key . The reporting is that he said Flynn 's a \u2018 good guy \u2019 but you 'd certainly need more than that to meet the obstruction of justice threshold . \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 m interested in how Comey characterizes the pressure that was placed on him , \u201d Brandon Garrett said . \u201c I want to know the intent behind that pressure . If it 's true that he was pressured to drop the investigation , it 's unlikely that was for arbitrary reasons . \u201d\nThus , if Comey says definitively that Trump pressured him to drop the investigation , Trump will have a hard time proving that his intent wasn \u2019 t to \u201c impede \u201d or otherwise obstruct the process .\nFor Joshua Dressler , the bar was comparatively low . In his view , Comey need only affirm what \u2019 s already been circulated in the media : \u201c If Comey merely stands by everything that 's already been reported in the press and adds nothing else , that alone is enough to suggest pretty definitively that justice was obstructed . \u201d",
