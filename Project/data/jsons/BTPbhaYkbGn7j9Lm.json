(Photo: Bryon Houlgrave/The Des Moines Register)\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa \u2014True-blue Democratic activists at a party fundraising dinner Friday night were positively giddy to have two possible presidential contenders there live and in person \u2014 Martin O'Malley and Jim Webb \u2014 and their frontrunner, Hillary Clinton, ready to dive into the race.\n\nBut they've got plenty of questions on their minds for Clinton, who kicked off her campaign Sunday, and her potential challengers for the Democratic nomination. Here's what they had to say in interviews with The Des Moines Register at the Polk County Democrats' Spring Dinner:\n\n1. WILL CLINTON START TO STAND FOR SOMETHING?\n\nIt has been nearly eight years since Clinton campaigned here, and no one knows what to expect, said many of the activists gathered at a labor union hall in Des Moines.\n\nThey're wondering: Has she grown into a more conservative Democrat over the years? Or will she take cues from ultra-left heartthrob Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and have the guts to stand tall on progressive issues? Will she have what it takes to capture the aspirations of the people?\n\n\"I'm a Hillary supporter, but I haven't closed my mind to say, 'It's Hillary or nobody,'\" said Joan Thorup, a Des Moines Beaverdale resident who has already met O'Malley three times. \"Things may have changed since the last time I saw her on the campaign trail.\"\n\nSeveral union members taking a smoke break outside the United Auto Workers hall where the dinner was held said the last time they heard Clinton speak, at the Harkin Steak Fry in September, she said nothing substantive.\n\nAsked how she can reignite a blaze of passion in Iowa, Earl Agan Jr. answered, \"I don't think she can.\" He's business manager for the Operative Plasterers & Cement Masons' International Association Local No. 21 and Area 561 Iowa. \"We've had too many Clintons and Bushes.

WHAT WILL THE DIVIDING LINES BE?\n\nWhat tack can possible Democratic challengers like former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley and former senator Jim Webb of Virginia take to successfully pry Iowa voters away from Clinton?\n\n\"I'm not sure how they'll draw distinctions,\" Patty Judge, a former lieutenant governor, said after listening to both men's speeches. \"They're both great guys, and they both have a great story to tell, but how they're going to distinguish themselves, I don't know.\"\n\nSeveral Democrats, describing the economy and personal prosperity as base issues, said the dividing line will be ideas for championing the middle class.

WILL ANY LABORERS MIGRATE TO THE GOP?\n\nA moderate GOP presidential candidate who supports construction of projects like the Keystone XL and Bakken pipelines could attract Democratic building trades workers tired of the Big Environmental lobby blocking projects that could put Iowa laborers to work.\n\nSeveral union members told the Register that the reality is that the United States isn't going to divest from oil, and they believe the country can have pipelines and a clean environment at the same time.\n\nO'Malley opposes the Keystone line and told the Register he didn't know details about the Bakken line, which would cross Iowa, but likely opposes it.

WILL CLINTON SHOUT DOWN THE GOP?\n\nNot only do Iowa Democrats want a vigorous Democrat-on-Democrat fight for the caucuses, they want to see their presidential contenders play hard with the GOP, hitting back with satisfying, quotable one-liners.\n\n\"We cannot let them get away with these misstatements, these constant misstatements of the facts,\" Smith said.\n\nDes Moines Democrat Sophia Douglas noted Republicans' furor over Clinton using a private email server as secretary of State, which has thwarted public scrutiny of her messages.
