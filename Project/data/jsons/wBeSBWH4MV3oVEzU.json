President Barack Obama was to attend the Pentagon memorial , and Vice President Joe Biden was to speak in Pennsylvania .\nBut many felt that last year \u2019 s 10th anniversary was an emotional turning point for public mourning of the attacks . For the first time , elected officials weren \u2019 t speaking at the ceremony , which often allowed them a solemn turn in the spotlight , but raised questions about the public and private Sept. 11 . Fewer families attended the ceremonies this year , and some cities canceled their remembrances altogether .\n\u201c I feel much more relaxed \u201d this year , said Jane Pollicino , who came to ground zero Tuesday morning to remember her husband , who was killed at the trade center . \u201c After the ninth anniversary , that next day , you started building up to the 10th year . This feels a lot different , in that regard . It \u2019 s another anniversary that we can commemorate in a calmer way , without that 10-year pressure . \u201d\nAs bagpipes played at the year-old Sept. 11 memorial in New York , family clutching balloons , flowers and photos of their loved ones bowed their heads in silence at 8:46 a.m. , the moment that the first hijacked jetliner crashed into the trade center \u2019 s north tower , and again to mark the crashes into the second tower , the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field .\nPresident Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama observed the moment in a ceremony on the White House \u2019 s south lawn , and then laid a white floral wreath at the Pentagon , above a concrete slab that said \u201c Sept . 11 , 2001 \u2014 937 am . \u201d\nVictims \u2019 families in New York began the solemn , familiar ritual of tearfully reading the names of nearly 3,000 killed , with personal messages to their lost loved ones .\n\u201c Rick , can you hear your name as the roll is called again ? On this sacred ground where your dust settled ? \u201d said Richard Blood , whose son , Richard Middleton Blood , Jr. , died in the trade center \u2019 s south tower . \u201c If only those who hear your name could know what a loving son and beautiful person you grew to be . I love you , son , and miss you terribly . \u201d\nThousands had attended the ceremony in New York in previous years , including last year \u2019 s milestone 10th anniversary . About 1,000 gathered by Tuesday morning , making paper rubbings of their loved ones \u2019 names etched onto the Sept. 11 memorial .\nCommuters rushed out of the subway and fewer police barricades were in place than in past years in the lower Manhattan neighborhood surrounding ground zero . More than 4 million people have visited the memorial in the past year , becoming more of a public space than a closed-off construction site . On Tuesday , much of downtown Manhattan bustled like a regular weekday , except for clusters of police and emergency vehicles on the borders of the site .\nFamilies had a mixed reaction to the changing ceremony , which kept politicians away from the microphone in New York for the first time . Charles G. Wolf , whose wife , Katherine , was killed at the trade center , said : \u201c We \u2019 ve gone past that deep , collective public grief. \u201d But Pollicino said it \u2019 s important that politicians still attend the ceremony .\n\u201c There \u2019 s something missing if they \u2019 re not here at all , \u201d she said . \u201c Now , all of a sudden , it \u2019 s \u2018 for the families. \u2019 This happened to our country \u2014 it didn \u2019 t happen only to me . \u201d\nAnd Joe Torres , who put in 16-hour days in ground zero \u2019 s \u201c pit \u201d in the days after the attacks , cleaning up tons of debris , said another year has changed nothing for him .\n\u201c The 11th year , for me , it \u2019 s the same as if it happened yesterday . It could be 50 years from now , and to me , it \u2019 ll be just as important as year one , or year five or year ten . \u201d\nPolitical leaders still are welcome to attend the ground zero ceremony , and they are expected at the other commemorations , as well .\nThe Obamas planned later to visit wounded soldiers at Walter Reed Army Medical Center . The U.S. terror attacks were followed by wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , where the U.S. military death toll years ago surpassed the 9/11 victim count . At least 1,987 U.S. troops have died in Afghanistan and 4,475 in Iraq , according to the Pentagon .\nAllied military forces marked the anniversary at a short ceremony at NATO \u2019 s headquarters in Kabul , Afghanistan with a tribute to more than 3,000 foreign troops killed in the decade-long war .\n\u201c Eleven years on from that day there should be no doubt that our dedication to this commitment , that commitment that was seared into our souls that day so long ago , remains strong and unshaken , \u201d said Marine Gen.
