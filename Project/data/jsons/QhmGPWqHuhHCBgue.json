    "content": "Countering the Republican-led opposition to President Barack Obama 's nominee for defense secretary is a less flashy but powerful constituency : military veterans .\nVeterans ' organizations have praised Chuck Hagel , a twice-wounded combat veteran of Vietnam and deputy administrator in President Ronald Reagan 's Veterans Administration .\nThe Veterans of Foreign Wars has called him uniquely qualified to become Pentagon chief . The Military Officers Association of America said his experience gives him `` a range of perspectives . '' The American Legion said he was a longtime advocate for veterans .\nThe organizations , which as congressionally chartered , stopped short of an outright endorsement .\nRepublican-leaning outside groups have waged a well-funded campaign against Hagel , airing television commercials , running full-page newspaper ads and expressing their opposition on local radio stations .\nOfficials from Americans for a Strong Defense , hoping to pressure Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor , spoke out on an Arkansas station this week .\nHagel 's first test could come as early as Thursday with a possible vote in the Senate Armed Services Committee .\nThe committee chairman , Sen.

Sen. Ted Cruz , R-Texas , is dissatisfied with what Hagel , a former two-term GOP senator from Nebraska , has disclosed so far .\n`` I 'm not going to make any decision on Sen.
