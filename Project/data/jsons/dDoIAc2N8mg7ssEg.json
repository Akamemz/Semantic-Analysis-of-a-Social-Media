    "content": "The authors of a recent analysis of ideological extremism in presidential elections over the past several decades \u2014 including the landslide defeats of Barry Goldwater and George McGovern \u2014 concluded that the electoral cost of extremism was \u201c negligible \u201d compared with the effects of other economic and political factors .\nGoldwater in 1964 and McGovern in 1972 probably did a few percentage points worse than they would have if they had been more moderate , but they lost mainly because they were challenging incumbents who presided over election-year economic booms .\nIn contrast , Ronald Reagan in 1980 and Barack Obama in 2008 had the good fortune to run in years when economic recessions undermined the political appeal of their more moderate opponents , and they both won easily .\nIn this year \u2019 s race , Mrs. Clinton is leading in the polls despite her \u201c hard-core liberal \u201d campaign stands and a voting record to the left of most Senate Democrats . Mr. Trump is trailing despite having moderated some of his party \u2019 s conservative stands on issues like social spending and gay rights . On the whole , his policy positions are probably closer to the \u201c center \u201d of the electorate than those of previous Republican presidential candidates have been . Yet many voters who ought to find those positions appealing have been alienated by Mr. Trump \u2019 s bombast and political inexperience .\nIt would be hard to argue that a candidate \u2019 s temperament and experience should be irrelevant to voters . But it is also worth asking whether policy \u201c extremism \u201d is such a bad thing , anyway . People who are quick to condemn the extremism of their political opponents often see virtue in their own party \u2019 s deviations from centrist opinion .\nThe single largest difference in positions between either party \u2019 s presidential candidates and swing voters over the past three decades has been on the issue of racial policy . On average , Republican candidates have been seen as just six points to the right of the political center on the question of government assistance to African-Americans . Democratic candidates have been 26 points to the left .",
