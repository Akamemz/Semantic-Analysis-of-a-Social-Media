    "content": "Senate Democrats are nearing a reckoning over the deal they made last month to reopen the federal government . At 12:01 am on Friday , the government will run out of funding .\nLast time , agitation from progressive activists convinced Democrats to shut down the government over the Deferred Action for Children Arrivals program , which provides work permits and deportation protections for nearly 700,000 people brought to the United States illegally as children . Though the March deadline for fully sunsetting the program is just around the corner , there doesn \u2019 t seem to be the same appetite among Democrats to close the government this time .\nDemocrats are betting they \u2019 ve found a road out of Shutdown Valley , thanks to a commitment they secured from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , that will allow them to amplify the pressure on House Republicans and President Trump to fix DACA without being forced to shutter the government again .\nThe Democratic thinking seems to be this : They have a pledge from McConnell to initiate an immigration debate in the coming days , one they believe will lead to the Senate passing some kind of bipartisan legislation . An overwhelming Senate vote , they think , will change the underlying dynamic of the DACA standoff , forcing the House and Trump to the table to find a real resolution to the issue \u2014 and if they don \u2019 t , the blame will be squarely on them .\nThat removes the need to shut down the government . But it \u2019 s a bet that requires McConnell to follow through on his word and for the debate to change as Democrats believe it will . After the minority showed little appetite for keeping the government closed last month , it appears to be their only option left .\nMcConnell pledged to move an immigration bill \u2014 as long as Democrats don \u2019 t shut down the government again\nIf Senate Democrats and Republicans were able to reach some agreement on immigration before February 8 , that would be the end of the matter .\nBut if an agreement is not reached , McConnell \u2019 s promise is this : He will bring an immigration bill to the Senate floor for debate after February 8 \u2014 so long as Democrats don \u2019 t shut down the government again .\n\u201c Should these issues not be resolved by the time the funding bill before us expires on February 8 , so long as the government remains open , \u201d the Republican leader said in a Senate floor speech \u2014 repeating for emphasis \u201c so long as the government remains open \u201d \u2014 \u201c it would be my intention to take up legislation here in the Senate that would address DACA and border security , as well as other related issues . \u201d\nSo McConnell \u2019 s condition for an immigration debate is that Democrats don \u2019 t oppose another short-term spending bill that the Senate will likely need to pass on February 8 . So long as the federal government is funded , he \u2019 ll bring some kind of DACA bill to the floor ; as for which one , he specifically referenced the ongoing negotiations between the No . 2 leaders in both parties and both chambers .\nHe also pledged to have a fair and open amendment process for whatever immigration bill is brought to the Senate floor .\n\u201c Let me be clear : This immigration debate will have a level playing field at the outset and an amendment process that is fair to all sides , \u201d McConnell said .\nDemocrats believe they have McConnell committed to moving an immigration bill\nMcConnell \u2019 s promise is predicated on an immigration agreement not being reached before the February 8 deadline for a new spending bill \u2014 and on Democrats not shutting down the government again when the time for another extension comes .\nProgressive activists were dubious when they railed against Senate Democrats \u2019 decision to end the shutdown . McConnell originally pledged to Sen. Susan Collins ( R-ME ) that a pair of health care bills would be brought to the floor before the end of last year . There had also been assurances given to Sen.

The point is , the progressive base doesn \u2019 t see McConnell as a good-faith negotiator and slammed the Democratic deal with the GOP leaders for that reason .\nNobody seems sure , with February 8 just days away , what happens now .
