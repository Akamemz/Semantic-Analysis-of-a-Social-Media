And there are dozens of additional Democrats who \u2019 ve signaled in interviews and statements that they are inclined to back Obama \u2019 s deal , which aims to stop Tehran \u2019 s development of a nuclear weapon in exchange for lifting economic sanctions . Most notably , not one of the 151 House Democrats who signed a May letter in support of the broad outlines of the agreement have announced opposition to the final product .\nObama needs at least 144 House Democrats to stick by him to sustain a veto of any GOP legislation that would undermine or dismantle the deal with Iran .\nGrowing Democratic support comes despite fierce opposition from Republicans and a huge , multimillion dollar effort by anti-deal groups like the powerful American Israel Public Affairs Committee .
