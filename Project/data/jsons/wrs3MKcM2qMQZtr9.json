    "content": "As the coronavirus crisis gained momentum at the end of March , Columbia Sportswear CEO Tim Boyle made headlines for cutting his annual salary from $ 954,810 to $ 10,000 . Although the company \u2019 s retail stores would temporarily close , Columbia announced that it would continue to pay store workers . The moves landed Boyle on a shortlist of billionaire corporate leaders who made personal compromises in an effort to shield employees from the pandemic \u2019 s economic blows . Capitalizing on the good press , Columbia launched a social media campaign called \u201c Tougher Together , \u201d which featured Q & A sessions with athletes and encouraged even the most avid outdoorspeople to stay home . But the hashtag \u2019 s reference to the company \u2019 s past \u201c Tested Tough \u201d and \u201c One Tough Mother \u201d advertising campaigns belied the slogan \u2019 s origins . Back in December , warehouse workers at Columbia \u2019 s Portland , Oregon , distribution center had marched into their manager \u2019 s office and delivered a petition demanding that the company remain neutral as they sought to form a union with the Teamsters . The pro-union workers launched a Facebook page the same day . Its title : Tougher Together . To the union organizers who came up with the slogan , many of whom have continued to work in the warehouse amid the pandemic , Columbia was using the crisis as an opportunity to take a jab at employees who suggested working conditions were less than exemplary . Boyle \u2019 s lauded pay cut also only told half the story . The same day that Oregon Gov . Kate Brown issued the state \u2019 s stay-at-home order , Boyle was scheduled to receive more than $ 6 million via a quarterly cash dividend on Columbia Sportswear stocks . In fact , his salary represented a tiny proportion of his pay last year , which totaled more than $ 26 million , according to an analysis for \u2588\u2588\u2588 by Matt Hopkins of the Academic-Industry Research Network . By comparison , disclosure records indicate that the median income for Columbia workers in 2019 was $ 27,562 . Only after Boyle received his March payout did the company suspend future cash dividends .\nAppropriating the workers \u2019 slogan was the latest in a long string of moves Columbia has made to demoralize and intimidate employees into ceasing union organizing , according to several people involved in the effort . Audio recordings provided to \u2588\u2588\u2588 offer a rare inside look at how a company long considered a pillar of the Pacific Northwest sought to crush workers \u2019 unionization efforts . As the pandemic hit , workers said they felt unprotected by Columbia \u2019 s safety measures and left without a voice in an environment where they feared the consequences of raising concerns . Behind closed doors , Columbia managers discussed sowing discord among employees and building cases for firing those involved in the unionization effort . They called some workers too dumb to know what a union was and made crude jokes about how they could retaliate . Columbia also hired union-busting consultants to spread misleading information among warehouse staff . By the time the coronavirus crisis became a full-blown pandemic , the unionization effort had been badly damaged . One of the key Tougher Together organizers , a delivery routing specialist named Rory Gatto , was fired based on allegations that he maintains are false . Gatto filed an unfair labor practice complaint with the National Labor Relations Board arguing that his firing was retaliatory , but the board dismissed the complaint because of a missed deadline . Four workers interviewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588 said they viewed the firing as retaliation for Gatto \u2019 s union leadership . Columbia Sportswear did not respond to multiple requests for comment about conditions in the Portland warehouse and other claims made by its employees . Detailed messages to Boyle and the managers who participated in the recorded conversations also went unanswered . When \u2588\u2588\u2588 called a company number for the senior executive at the warehouse , Vice President of Global Distribution Alonzo Plater , a woman answered and stated , \u201c No comment. \u201d As the number of daily coronavirus deaths has dropped in some of the hardest-hit parts of the U.S. , Columbia is already beginning to lift social distancing precautions it put in place . To workers who feel at risk , the need for a union is greater than ever . \u201c Having that sense of security , where if you \u2019 re not doing anything wrong , you don \u2019 t have to be scared \u2014 we don \u2019 t have that right now , \u201d said Ivan Mikhaylov , who has worked at the warehouse for 13 years . \u201c Having the union , people wouldn \u2019 t have to be scared to speak up. \u201d Low Pay , Empty First Aid Kits It wasn \u2019 t any one problem that led workers at the Portland warehouse to approach the Teamsters , but rather a steady accumulation that lowered their quality of life . Several hundred people from a diverse array of backgrounds work at the warehouse , bringing in bulk shipments of outdoor clothing and repackaging items for wholesale and online orders . It \u2019 s a fast-paced environment , where workers are closely monitored by an electronic labor management system that records how efficiently tasks are completed . If workers fail to meet efficiency quotas , they can be disciplined . What tipped the scale for some were lower-than-expected raises and bonuses and increased health insurance costs . The hourly wages of warehouse employees interviewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588 ranged from $ 16 to $ 20 . Given the cost of living in Portland , where median rent for a two-bedroom is around $ 1,300 , the pay falls short of qualifying as a living wage for many workers . Gatto said that it was common for the company to hold school supply and Christmas gift drives for fellow workers , and at one point , information was posted in the dining area about how to find local food banks and housing assistance . For others , it was a shift from four-day to five-day workweeks that inspired organizing efforts . Mandatory overtime at the warehouse was common , often announced or canceled with little warning , and employees said the scheduling change only made it more difficult to plan for family time or child care . Furthermore , several workers told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that pressure from managers for speed and efficiency , combined with the company \u2019 s low safety standards and unwillingness to spend money to maintain equipment , made for a dangerous environment . Mikhaylov said that the conveyer belts workers used to move boxes had long been in need of repair or replacement . Another employee , Andrew DeMarrias , said that colleagues concerned about their efficiency quotas often risked injury by clearing jammed conveyer belts themselves , rather than waiting for a maintenance crew . Until recently , injured workers could not even access first aid supplies , according to current and former employees . In 2015 , Gatto told \u2588\u2588\u2588 , he was moving a pallet when a sliver of wood stabbed his abdomen . He was bleeding and sought to clean and bandage the wound . The first aid kit near his station was nearly empty , as was a second kit he tracked down in another part of the warehouse . Wary that the employee tracking system would show a pause in his task , he said he cleaned up with a paper towel and returned to work . A few days later , he was diagnosed with a staph infection because of the injury . In the months that followed , Gatto said , he attended company safety meetings and attempted to convince managers to refill the first aid kits . He even volunteered to come up with a tracking system to make sure the materials remained stocked . The effort went nowhere .\nBy the fall of 2019 , a group of workers had begun the union drive with support from the Teamsters . It wasn \u2019 t until after organizing began and a worker complained to the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration that the first aid kits were finally filled . An OSHA inspection record shows that a safety complaint was opened at the end of October and closed on December 4 . Anti-Union Scare Tactics Alonzo Plater , the most senior executive in the Portland warehouse , called workers into a meeting on October 1 . \u201c We \u2019 ve started to hear some rumors and conversations around the Teamsters union , \u201d he said , according to audio from the meeting . \u201c I \u2019 ve worked in a union environment , and I want to tell you openly my opinion that having a third party like the Teamsters is not what we need here at Columbia. \u201d A group of consultants would be arriving later in the week to educate workers about what unionization meant , he announced . Union avoidance firms , which exploded in the U.S. in the 1970s , have played a key role in reducing the proportion of private sector workforces that are unionized today . Thomas McKibbin , a Teamsters organizer who has been working with the Columbia employees in Portland , was already familiar with the Crossroads Group before the consultants arrived at the warehouse . The company is run by two former union officials : Michael Penn , an ex-Teamster , and Steve Beyer , former president of a California office of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union . Columbia paid Crossroads $ 400 per hour to \u201c answer employee questions about unions \u201d and communicate with them about their right to organize or refrain from organizing , according to federal disclosure forms , one of which was signed by Boyle . Jane McAlevey , a longtime labor organizer who has written several books about the labor movement , said coaching workers on what to expect from union avoidance firms like Crossroads has become an essential step for organizers . \u201c If you haven \u2019 t been inoculating workers about the employer campaign to come , you \u2019 re probably going to be in very , very big trouble once the union buster starts. \u201d The arrival of the firm caught the Teamsters off guard . \u201c Most companies will act aggressively to stop to an organizing drive , \u201d said McKibbin . \u201c But usually that happens at the end of a campaign , when we \u2019 re getting ready to vote in a National Labor Relations Board election . Columbia was very aggressive , very early on. \u201d Soon after Plater \u2019 s announcement , Miko Penn , a senior Crossroads consultant , held a meeting with warehouse staff . In a recording of the meeting provided to \u2588\u2588\u2588 , Penn suggested that union organizers were tricksters and profiteers who used scams to deceive people into joining . Crossroads President Michael Penn declined to comment on the contents of the session , stating , \u201c We would defer to our client on all of those matters. \u201d A key part of union organizing involves workers signing union authorization cards . Once workers obtain signed cards from 30 percent of employees , they are allowed to reach out to the National Labor Relations Board to set up an official election . However , in the interest of assuring a win , experienced organizers often encourage workers to wait to launch an NLRB election until a supermajority has signed cards , said McAlevey , since union avoidance firms like Crossroads can shave off as much as a quarter of the vote . If the majority votes yes , the collective bargaining unit is formed . Penn suggested to the Columbia workers that virtually any piece of paper they put their name on or link they clicked related to the Teamsters could be a trick . \u201c They can tell you it \u2019 s a contact list . They can tell you you \u2019 re signing up for a union mailer for extra information , \u201d she said . \u201c Sometimes it \u2019 s , \u2018 Do you want more information ? \u2019 Yes , union , I do \u2014 you know , like text yes to this . That could have been your authorization \u2014 it doesn \u2019 t have to be the physical cards. \u201d \u201c That clearly is a way to scare people from even talking to us , \u201d McKibbin said . \u201c First , the NLRB would never accept something that ridiculous , but second of all , we would lose the election . We only want authorization cards by people who support the union. \u201d Penn repeatedly suggested that joining a union \u2014 or even signing a card \u2014 could make workers vulnerable to \u201c discipline \u201d if they broke union rules . She only vaguely defined what \u201c discipline \u201d meant , although she indicated that union members could be fined $ 5,000 or lose their job if they attempted to leave the union .\n\u201c They try to scare workers into believing we \u2019 re going to go around fining members . That \u2019 s silly \u2014 theoretically it could happen , I suppose , but it never does , \u201d McKibbin said , adding that the type of activity that would lead to discipline would be \u201c if an officer of a local union does something illegal. \u201d McAlevey said Penn \u2019 s approach was common . \u201c The minute the employer knows you \u2019 re there , the first series of pieces of literature are the ones warning you not to sign the union card , and warning you that once you do , you essentially signed your life away and you can go to union jail , \u201d she said . At one point , Penn noted that it was illegal for unions to threaten people \u2014 but claimed that sometimes they did anyway . Unions , according to Penn , will tell workers , \u201c If you don \u2019 t jump on board now , we \u2019 re going to remember who our friends were , and we have a long memory , so once we \u2019 re in , you \u2019 re going to lose your job \u2014 we \u2019 re going to make sure you \u2019 re fired. \u201d Laying out her version of the possible economic effects of unionization , Penn said , \u201c It doesn \u2019 t always end up going so badly , but I \u2019 ve seen people completely bankrupted \u2014 marriages lost , homes lost . \u201d\nCrossroads consultants visited the warehouse floor repeatedly to hold group sessions and one-on-one meetings with workers . Many employees initially seemed turned off by the presentations for being so one-sided , Gatto said . \u201c But even right away , when you started talking , people would be like , \u2018 I don \u2019 t want to lose $ 5,000. \u2019 \u201d Meanwhile , Gatto and others said they started to notice managers attempting to listen in on conversations between pro-union workers . Many grew more hesitant to talk about organizing . McKibbin said that misleading messaging is the name of the game . \u201c If a worker is confused or feels like they don \u2019 t have a good understanding of things , they \u2019 re not going to support the union. \u201d \u201c Get Them Shit Pies \u201d Eager to regain momentum , a small group of workers wearing Teamsters T-shirts gathered during a shift change on December 4 . Filming with a phone as they entered the warehouse , the group marched to Plater \u2019 s office and delivered a petition signed by 47 people demanding that the company stop spreading false information , spying on workers , and intimidating them from exercising their right to form a union . During the next shift , dozens of people wore Teamsters T-shirts in support of their colleagues who had delivered the petition . Some placed union flyers around the warehouse . In a meeting later that day , which was recorded by an anonymous source , managers discussed how they should respond , zeroing in on Gatto , who had done the talking in Plater \u2019 s office . \u201c It was reported to Alonzo and I a little while ago that Rory Gatto has posted on Facebook during work hours the \u2018 success \u2019 of his coworkers this afternoon , \u201d one female manager said . \u201c I \u2019 m trying to figure out where this line is where we hear they can \u2019 t do this type of stuff on working hours . \u201d\nThe group agreed to track down exactly when Gatto had clocked in . A human resources manager encouraged them to be consistent with past enforcement of social media policies . \u201c We just need to be professional , \u201d she said . \u201c Follow our processes , remember why we \u2019 re there , and be consistent and professional in our actions. \u201d \u201c But if they present an opportunity , I want it , \u201d Plater replied . The group laughed . Versions of that sentiment would be repeated in two additional management meetings captured by an audio recorder . \u201c Probably more than three-quarters of the list are people who have behavioral issues , attendance issues , there \u2019 s something in their file , \u201d a female manager said of the petition signatories in a second meeting . The leadership team fantasized aloud about which workers they would like to fire . One manager mentioned a worker whom she \u2019 d helped get a job at the warehouse . \u201c I \u2019 m kicking myself now , I \u2019 m like , shit , I wish I could fire you. \u201d The managers jokingly suggested giving a pro-union worker a promotion as a means to stop him from organizing . \u201c Put him in a position , give him 90 days , and then say , sorry , you suck at this job , and so we \u2019 re going to let you go , \u201d a male manager said . \u201c Buh-bye. \u201d One meeting participant noted that Plater was \u201c on board with firing \u201d an employee who had worn a Teamsters T-shirt who the managers believed could be disciplined on performance grounds . Later in the conversation , another recalled a joke she \u2019 d shared with Plater about pretending to be unaware that the law prohibits retaliation on the basis of an employee \u2019 s union activity . \u201c He \u2019 s like , I \u2019 m gon na fire them right now , and then play like I \u2019 m stupid \u2014 just be like , I didn \u2019 t know . \u201d\nSome employees , one of the managers suggested , were simply being manipulated . \u201c I know this is going to sound terrible , but these guys are too dumb to know what they \u2019 re doing , and they are very clearly being taken advantage of , \u201d she said of two workers who had worn Teamsters T-shirts . It was a theme that would come up again . \u201c That \u2019 s another one that I think just doesn \u2019 t understand , \u201d a manager said of another worker who had worn a T-shirt . All three of the employees named were people of color . One manager described how a worker had asked her if people were allowed to be putting flyers on break area tables . \u201c I said , I can \u2019 t touch them , but you sure can , \u201d she recalled . \u201c Go in there and rip them all up if you wish , but you didn \u2019 t hear it from me . \u201d\nThe group lamented the possibility that pro-union employees could win an upcoming company pie-eating contest . \u201c We \u2019 re going to get them shit pies , \u201d one manager joked . He described a scene from the 1960s period drama \u201c The Help \u201d in which a black woman serves a chocolate pie to her racist former employer and then informs the white woman that she \u2019 s just eaten the ex-maid \u2019 s excrement .\nA company lawyer was already tracking employees \u2019 policy violations , one manager assured a larger group the next day , \u201c doing a lot of case-based fact-finding \u2014 any Facebook posts that we \u2019 re escalating \u2014 she is just adding , adding , adding , and building this case , \u201d she said . One attendee asked if Gatto could be disciplined for violating a security policy when he swiped his badge to let the pro-Teamsters group into the office area of the warehouse , rather than forcing each individual to swipe their own badge . \u201c We can through the case-building process , \u201d the manager replied . \u201c We can document all this stuff , which is what \u2019 s happening . \u201d\nPlater sought to reassure the meeting participants . \u201c This is a group of folks , some of them not the best performers , looking to unite in some way to strike back in some way either against you guys or against Columbia , \u201d he said . \u201c Some of the folks that are organizing , they \u2019 re our team too , and they \u2019 re just a bit confused . They \u2019 re a bit misguided in some cases . But then there are others who are really trying to stick the screws into something. \u201d For the latter group , he continued , the company need only wait . \u201c Some of them are going down a bad path , and we just need to allow that path to happen , and we need to collect our data . \u201d",

That could have been your authorization \u2014 it doesn\u2019t have to be the physical cards.\u201d \u201cThat clearly is a way to scare people from even talking to us,\u201d McKibbin said. \u201cFirst, the NLRB would never accept something that ridiculous, but second of all, we would lose the election. We only want authorization cards by people who support the union.\u201d Penn repeatedly suggested that joining a union \u2014 or even signing a card \u2014 could make workers vulnerable to \u201cdiscipline\u201d if they broke union rules. She only vaguely defined what \u201cdiscipline\u201d meant, although she indicated that union members could be fined $5,000 or lose their job if they attempted to leave the union.\n\n\u201cThey try to scare workers into believing we\u2019re going to go around fining members. That\u2019s silly \u2014 theoretically it could happen, I suppose, but it never does,\u201d McKibbin said, adding that the type of activity that would lead to discipline would be \u201cif an officer of a local union does something illegal.\u201d McAlevey said Penn\u2019s approach was common. \u201cThe minute the employer knows you\u2019re there, the first series of pieces of literature are the ones warning you not to sign the union card, and warning you that once you do, you essentially signed your life away and you can go to union jail,\u201d she said. At one point, Penn noted that it was illegal for unions to threaten people \u2014 but claimed that sometimes they did anyway. Unions, according to Penn, will tell workers, \u201cIf you don\u2019t jump on board now, we\u2019re going to remember who our friends were, and we have a long memory, so once we\u2019re in, you\u2019re going to lose your job \u2014 we\u2019re going to make sure you\u2019re fired.\u201d Laying out her version of the possible economic effects of unionization, Penn said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t always end up going so badly, but I\u2019ve seen people completely bankrupted \u2014 marriages lost, homes lost.\u201d\n\nCrossroads consultants visited the warehouse floor repeatedly to hold group sessions and one-on-one meetings with workers. Many employees initially seemed turned off by the presentations for being so one-sided, Gatto said. \u201cBut even right away, when you started talking, people would be like, \u2018I don\u2019t want to lose $5,000.\u2019\u201d Meanwhile, Gatto and others said they started to notice managers attempting to listen in on conversations between pro-union workers. Many grew more hesitant to talk about organizing. McKibbin said that misleading messaging is the name of the game. \u201cIf a worker is confused or feels like they don\u2019t have a good understanding of things, they\u2019re not going to support the union.\u201d \u201cGet Them Shit Pies\u201d Eager to regain momentum, a small group of workers wearing Teamsters T-shirts gathered during a shift change on December 4. Filming with a phone as they entered the warehouse, the group marched to Plater\u2019s office and delivered a petition signed by 47 people demanding that the company stop spreading false information, spying on workers, and intimidating them from exercising their right to form a union. During the next shift, dozens of people wore Teamsters T-shirts in support of their colleagues who had delivered the petition. Some placed union flyers around the warehouse. In a meeting later that day, which was recorded by an anonymous source, managers discussed how they should respond, zeroing in on Gatto, who had done the talking in Plater\u2019s office. \u201cIt was reported to Alonzo and I a little while ago that Rory Gatto has posted on Facebook during work hours the \u2018success\u2019 of his coworkers this afternoon,\u201d one female manager said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out where this line is where we hear they can\u2019t do this type of stuff on working hours.\u201d\n\nThe group agreed to track down exactly when Gatto had clocked in. A human resources manager encouraged them to be consistent with past enforcement of social media policies. \u201cWe just need to be professional,\u201d she said. \u201cFollow our processes, remember why we\u2019re there, and be consistent and professional in our actions.\u201d \u201cBut if they present an opportunity, I want it,\u201d Plater replied. The group laughed. Versions of that sentiment would be repeated in two additional management meetings captured by an audio recorder. \u201cProbably more than three-quarters of the list are people who have behavioral issues, attendance issues, there\u2019s something in their file,\u201d a female manager said of the petition signatories in a second meeting. The leadership team fantasized aloud about which workers they would like to fire. One manager mentioned a worker whom she\u2019d helped get a job at the warehouse. \u201cI\u2019m kicking myself now, I\u2019m like, shit, I wish I could fire you.\u201d The managers jokingly suggested giving a pro-union worker a promotion as a means to stop him from organizing. \u201cPut him in a position, give him 90 days, and then say, sorry, you suck at this job, and so we\u2019re going to let you go,\u201d a male manager said. \u201cBuh-bye.\u201d One meeting participant noted that Plater was \u201con board with firing\u201d an employee who had worn a Teamsters T-shirt who the managers believed could be disciplined on performance grounds. Later in the conversation, another recalled a joke she\u2019d shared with Plater about pretending to be unaware that the law prohibits retaliation on the basis of an employee\u2019s union activity. \u201cHe\u2019s like, I\u2019m gonna fire them right now, and then play like I\u2019m stupid \u2014 just be like, I didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nSome employees, one of the managers suggested, were simply being manipulated. \u201cI know this is going to sound terrible, but these guys are too dumb to know what they\u2019re doing, and they are very clearly being taken advantage of,\u201d she said of two workers who had worn Teamsters T-shirts. It was a theme that would come up again. \u201cThat\u2019s another one that I think just doesn\u2019t understand,\u201d a manager said of another worker who had worn a T-shirt. All three of the employees named were people of color. One manager described how a worker had asked her if people were allowed to be putting flyers on break area tables. \u201cI said, I can\u2019t touch them, but you sure can,\u201d she recalled. \u201cGo in there and rip them all up if you wish, but you didn\u2019t hear it from me.\u201d\n\nThe group lamented the possibility that pro-union employees could win an upcoming company pie-eating contest. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get them shit pies,\u201d one manager joked. He described a scene from the 1960s period drama \u201cThe Help\u201d in which a black woman serves a chocolate pie to her racist former employer and then informs the white woman that she\u2019s just eaten the ex-maid\u2019s excrement.\n\nA company lawyer was already tracking employees\u2019 policy violations, one manager assured a larger group the next day, \u201cdoing a lot of case-based fact-finding \u2014 any Facebook posts that we\u2019re escalating \u2014 she is just adding, adding, adding, and building this case,\u201d she said. One attendee asked if Gatto could be disciplined for violating a security policy when he swiped his badge to let the pro-Teamsters group into the office area of the warehouse, rather than forcing each individual to swipe their own badge. \u201cWe can through the case-building process,\u201d the manager replied. \u201cWe can document all this stuff, which is what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Provided to The Intercept\n\nPlater sought to reassure the meeting participants. \u201cThis is a group of folks, some of them not the best performers, looking to unite in some way to strike back in some way either against you guys or against Columbia,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of the folks that are organizing, they\u2019re our team too, and they\u2019re just a bit confused. They\u2019re a bit misguided in some cases. But then there are others who are really trying to stick the screws into something.\u201d For the latter group, he continued, the company need only wait. \u201cSome of them are going down a bad path, and we just need to allow that path to happen, and we need to collect our data.\u201d",
