Another would shorten \u2014 or potentially eliminate \u2014 a provision in the bill that would bar the president from lifting legislative sanctions while Congress reviews the bill for 60 days , according to multiple sources familiar with the matter .\nThe proposed modifications stemmed from administration officials who have been contacting senators in both parties to explain their opposition to the legislation , which was written by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker ( R-Tenn. ) and would give Congress an avenue to reject the nuclear framework after reviewing the agreement . Publicly , the White House is standing by its veto threat , but with support for the measure nearing a veto-proof majority in the Senate , administration officials are also hoping to alter the bill in a way they can live with .\nCorker \u2019 s committee is scheduled to vote on the legislation Tuesday , and the bill appears increasingly likely to move to the Senate floor in the coming weeks .\nSen. Chris Coons ( D-Del . ) , a member of the Foreign Relations Committee , has filed an amendment removing the terrorism certification language and has spoken to Corker about incorporating it . Sen.

Ben Cardin ( D-Md . ) is spearheading the effort to alter the bill in a manner that is more palatable to the White House , a sharp departure from the hawkish stance of indicted Sen.
