    "content": "Ten years ago , the Pentagon paid for a climate study that put forth many scary scenarios .\nConsultants told the military that , by now , California would be flooded by inland seas , The Hague would be unlivable , polar ice would be mostly gone in summer , and global temperatures would rise at an accelerated rate as high as 0.5 degrees a year .\nYet the 2003 report , \u201c An Abrupt Climate Change Scenario and Its Implications for United States National Security , \u201d is credited with kick-starting the movement that , to this day and perhaps with more vigor than ever , links climate change to national security .\nThe report also became gospel to climate change doomsayers , who predicted pervasive and more intense hurricanes , tornadoes , floods and droughts .\n\u201c The release of this report is what likely sparked the \u2018 modern era \u2019 of security interest in climate affairs , \u201d said Jeff Kueter , president of the George C. Marshall Institute , a nonprofit that examines scientific issues that affect public policy .\n\u201c It was widely publicized and very much a tool of the political battles over climate raging at the time , \u201d said Mr. Kueter , who sees as \u201c tenuous \u201d a link between U.S. security and climate change .\nDoug Randall , who co-authored the Pentagon report , said , \u201c Even I \u2019 m surprised at how often it \u2019 s referred to .\n\u201c I think it did have an impact , for sure , in getting people talking and seeing the connection , which at that time was harder for some people than it is today , \u201d said Mr. Randall , who heads the consulting firm Monitor 360 .\nSome critics say such alarmist reports are causing the Pentagon to shift money that could be used for weapons and readiness . It is making big investments in biofuels , for example , and is working climate change into high-level strategic planning .\nThere is no exact budget line for climate change . The Government Accountability Office in 2011 documented a big increase in federal spending , from $ 4.6 billion in 2003 to nearly $ 9 billion in 2010 .\nSen. James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma , the top Republican on the Senate Committee on Armed Services , has been the chief congressional critic of the Pentagon \u2019 s financial commitment to climate change . He said biofuel projects should be left to the Energy Department .\n\u201c The president \u2019 s misguided priorities with our national security can be seen in the $ 1 trillion defense cuts he has put into motion since taking office and then using the limited defense budget to support his green agenda , \u201d Mr. Inhofe said in a statement to The \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c His green spending in the defense budget is based on the belief that climate change is the \u2018 new weapon of mass destruction. \u2019 In the meantime the president has loosened sanctions on Iran , [ which ] has maintained their resources to develop and launch a nuclear weapon \u2014 the real weapon of mass destruction . \u201d\nThe 2003 report was produced by a consulting firm , then called the Global Business Network , for the Pentagon \u2019 s office of net assessment . It is a driving force to allocate money to counter global threats \u2014 in this case , climate change .\nUnder the section \u201c Warming up to 2010 , \u201d here are some of the report \u2019 s key scenarios , compared with what has transpired :\n\u2022 By 2005 , \u201c more severe storms and typhoons bring about higher storm surges and floods . \u201d\nToday : The most recent U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report said it has \u201c low confidence \u201d of an increase in hurricanes or tornadoes . The U.S. is likely experiencing fewer tornadoes compared with 50 years ago , according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . This year \u2019 s tornado season was historically low .\nThe U.N. report said : \u201c No robust trends in annual numbers of tropical storms , hurricanes and major hurricane counts have been identified over the past 100 years in the North Atlantic basin . \u201d\nIn December , Roger Pielke , a scientist who has conducted extensive analysis of storm history , told a Senate panel : \u201c There exists exceedingly little scientific support for claims found in the media and political debate that hurricanes , tornadoes , floods and droughts have increased in frequency or intensity on climate timescales either in the United States or globally . \u201d\nThe U.S. has not experienced a major hurricane in nearly 10 years .\n\u2022 Global temperatures will increase by 0.5 degrees Fahrenheit per decade and , in some areas , 0.5 degrees per year .\nToday : Scientists skeptical of man-made climate change say satellite data show there has been no increase in 17 years . The Environmental Protection Agency , a strong climate change advocate , puts the decade increase at 0.3 degrees .\n\u2022 There will be more floods , making coastal cities such as The Hague \u201c unlivable \u201d by 2007 .\nThe United Nations said this year : \u201c There continues to be a lack of evidence and thus low confidence regarding the sign of trend in the magnitude and/or frequency of floods on a global scale . \u201d\n\u2022 \u201c Floating ice in the northern polar seas is mostly gone during the summer by 2010 . \u201d\nToday : Arctic sea ice remains .
