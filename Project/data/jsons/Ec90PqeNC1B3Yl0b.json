Instantly, Donald Trump Jr. and right-wing \u201cmedia outlets\u201d were amplifying the false claim. That evening, Tucker Carlson dedicated a segment of his Fox News program to attacking me and Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), another prominent woman of color, under the banner, \u201cWe Have to Fight to Preserve Our Nation & Heritage.\u201d My congressional office and social media feeds were instantly flooded with hate speech, calls for deportation and, as is so often the case, death threats.\n\nIt was something I\u2019ve become accustomed to as a black Muslim woman in public life.
