    "content": "The tax furor triggered by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has opened debate on a core question for all Democrats : Where should government get more money ?\nVirtually none doubt the need for new revenue . Aside from new programs the party favors , the federal budget deficit is already projected to top $ 1 trillion in 2019 and keep rising for years .\nOcasio-Cortez , the 29-year-old Democratic firebrand who just took her seat to represent the Bronx in the House , has sparked headlines by suggesting rates as high as 70 percent to finance a `` Green New Deal . '' That drew swift derision from House GOP Whip Steve Scalise , who summarized it as `` Take away 70 percent of your income and give it to leftist fantasy programs . ''\nIn fact , Ocasio-Cortez did n't propose taking 70 percent of anyone 's income . She suggested applying the rate only to earnings beyond $ 10 million , meaning those affected would pay a much lower share of their income overall .\nThe top tax rate stood above 90 percent throughout the 1950s . But through deductions and tax avoidance , `` taxes on the rich were not that much higher '' then , the conservative Tax Foundation noted in a 2017 article .\nThe top rate remained 70 percent as late as 1981 , the first year of Ronald Reagan 's presidency . The most affluent 1 percent paid a far lower average rate of 30.5 percent , however , according to a Tax Policy Center analysis . By 1989 , when Reagan left office , the top rate had been slashed to 28 percent but their average rate dropped only slightly to 27.9 percent .\nAfter three decades with top rates below 40 percent , a big hike from today 's 37 percent poses risks politically and perhaps economically . Self-described socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders stopped at a 54.2 percent for incomes above $ 10 million in his 2016 presidential campaign proposal ; Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton proposed 43.6 percent for those earning above $ 5 million .\nWith little prospect of success under President Donald Trump , the new House Democratic majority has avoided the issue in its initial legislative agenda . But the party 's gathering field of 2020 presidential candidates wo n't have that luxury .\nThe only formally declared Democratic candidate , former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland , wants to finance infrastructure projects by raising the recently enacted 21 percent top corporate rate to 25 percent . Sen. Kamala Harris of California has proposed curbing income inequality by rolling back all the Trump tax cuts in favor of expanded tax credits for modest earners .\n`` You 've got to ask , 'What constitutes a fair share in this economy ? ' '' Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren told me in a recent Speakeasy interview . She conceded that 1950s-era rates `` sound pretty shockingly high , '' but declined to specify what she favors .\nBetsey Stevenson , a former economic adviser to President Barack Obama , favors other targets : eliminating the `` step-up '' valuation that lets some inherited assets avoid capital gains taxes , and capping tax deductions for the wealthy .
