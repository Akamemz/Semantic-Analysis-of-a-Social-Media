    "content": "President Trump will propose a pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrant Dreamers , nearly tripling the Obama-era DACA program , the White House said Thursday .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s vision , which he will submit to Congress next week , would grant legal status to fewer than the 3 million people under the plan Senate Democrats have backed . But the number of people is far higher than the 690,000 in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program .\nWhite House officials said they felt they had to go that far in order to demand major changes on the security side , including an end to catch-and-release of illegal immigrants snared at the border , faster deportations for those caught overstaying their visas inside the U.S. and $ 25 billion for Mr. Trump \u2019 s wall .\nThe president also will demand strict limits on the chain of family migration across the board \u2014 not just for newly legalized Dreamers .\nHe would allow immigrants to petition for spouses and minor children but would eliminate parents , siblings and adult children from chain migration . Extended family already in the backlog would be allowed to enter , but no further applications would be accepted .\nThe combination of legalization and security puts Mr. Trump squarely in the middle of the immigration debate , between Democrats who want a more generous amnesty and House Republicans who opposed citizenship and were instead pushing a massive package of security changes .\nSEE ALSO : Trump says he \u2019 s open to more time on DACA if needed\n\u201c As part of this effort to ensure there is full bipartisan support for this package , we believe the total number that will be able to apply for legal status \u2026 will be a population of individuals of 1.8 million people , \u201d a senior White House official said .\nThe official said Mr. Trump wouldn \u2019 t agree to a deal on Dreamers without the border security , enforcement and policy changes .\n\u201c This is kind of a bottom line for the president , \u201d another official told reporters at the White House .\nThe plan calls for a $ 25 billion trust fund to build Mr. Trump \u2019 s border wall and other infrastructure . That would ensure a future Congress couldn \u2019 t withhold the money .\nMr. Obama supported a path to citizenship for Dreamers but was unable to get that legislation through Congress , which was why his administration circumvented Capitol Hill to create the DACA program .\nBegun in 2012 , the program approved some 800,000 people for renewable two-year permits granting them a stay of deportation and authority to work in the U.S. Of those people , some 690,000 were still protected under DACA as of late last year .\nOf the additional 1.1 million people Mr. Trump would enroll , about 600,000 were eligible for DACA but , for various reasons , didn \u2019 t apply , and 500,000 or so who would be admitted under adjusted timelines .\nThe White House called the 1.8 million \u201c a dramatic concession by the White House to get to 60 votes in the Senate . \u201d\nIt would take the immigrants 10 to 12 years to earn citizenship .\nSen. Ted Cruz , Texas Republican , said the president had embraced an amnesty that even President Obama was denied .\n\u201c I do not believe we should be granting a path to citizenship to anybody here illegally , \u201d he said . \u201c All of these proposals being floated that have a path to citizenship for DACA recipients are markedly to the left of where President Obama was . DACA itself has no path to citizenship under President Obama \u2019 s illegal executive amnesty . \u201d\nDemocrats remained skeptical of Mr. Trump \u2019 s support for citizenship , which he announced to reporters on Wednesday .\n\u201c What he says on Tuesday is not necessarily what he says on Thursday , \u201d said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon , the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee .\nOther Democrats said Mr. Trump \u2019 s calculus of a trade of Dreamers for the wall was still unacceptable .\n\u201c I do not support border wall funding , \u201d said Sen. Cory A. Booker , New Jersey Democrat .\nHe said he was holding out hope that Dreamers could get citizenship without a wall .\n\u201c I \u2019 m a prisoner of hope , but that does not mean I have some Pollyannaish view that this is going to work out , \u201d said Mr. Booker . \u201c Hope is work , hope is sacrifice , so we are going to fight this . \u201d\nStill , Sen. Michael F. Bennet , Colorado Democrat , said the president \u2019 s move toward citizenship for Dreamers was encouraging .\n\u201c I think there is a general consensus among people working on this that a pathway has to be part of it , \u201d he said .\nThe White House plan could undercut efforts by House conservatives , who back a much tougher security plan . That would grant the 690,000 people under DACA a new legal status of three-year work permits , approved by Congress , in exchange for mandatory use of E-Verify for employers to check work status , curtailing abuse of the asylum system , cracking down on sanctuary cities and punishing repeat illegal immigrants .\nThe White House said it envisioned Mr. Trump \u2019 s plan as the basis for Senate negotiations but expected the House to pass its own bill .\n\u201c We \u2019 re not trying to force something on the House at this point . I think the House has got its own independent process , \u201d an adviser said .\nThe White House said the president \u2019 s plan would boost security at the northern border as well , which could entice senators in Montana , North Dakota and Minnesota who are calling for attention to the U.S.-Canada line .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s plan would cancel the Diversity Visa Lottery , which gives 50,000 visas per year based on chance . Those visas would be recaptured and used to reduce the backlog in merit-based migration .\nThe president also asked Congress to allow faster deportations for those who overstay their visitors \u2019 visas , who could account for half of all new illegal immigration .\nMr. Trump said Congress must change the laws to help end the catch-and-release policy that applies to countries other than Mexico and Canada who can not be quickly turned back home .\nUnder the current system , migrants who can not be detained are released with the hope that they will return for their deportation hearings . They rarely do .\nThe White House said it had dozens of other enforcement changes it could have demanded , such as E-Verify , but it would pursue those later .\n\u201c This is the first bite , \u201d said a White House official . \u201c There is a second phase to this . There are 11 million people who live here illegally . \u201d\nThe plan is unlikely to please activists on either side of the debate .\nIndeed , immigrant rights groups were skeptical even after Mr. Trump said he would support full citizenship rights .\nFrank Sharry , executive director of America \u2019 s Voice , called it \u201c a spoonful of sugar before the bitter medicine of Trump \u2019 s far-reaching nativist agenda . \u201d\n\u201c No way . We won \u2019 t stand for it , \u201d he said . \u201c They don \u2019 t get to exploit a crisis they created to take a wrecking ball to the Statue of Liberty . \u201d",
