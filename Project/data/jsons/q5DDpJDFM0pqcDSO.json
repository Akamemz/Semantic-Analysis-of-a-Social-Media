The grand jury is convening today to decide if police officer Darren Wilson , who shot and killed Brown , violated the law and if he should face charges of either manslaughter or murder.Holder is heading to Ferguson , where rioters have taken to the streets , and a strongly militarized police force has sent in armored trucks with tear gas and flash grenades . `` At the core of these demonstrations is a demand for answers about the circumstances of this young man \u2019 s death and a broader concern about the state of our criminal justice system , '' Holder wrote . `` Today , I will be in Ferguson to be briefed on the federal civil rights investigation that I have closely monitored since I launched it more than one week ago . `` Holder promised the people of Ferguson that the federal investigation will be full , fair , and independent.Further , he promised that the Justice Department will work with police , civil rights leaders , and members of the public on action `` aimed at bridging persistent gaps between law enforcement officials and the communities we serve .
