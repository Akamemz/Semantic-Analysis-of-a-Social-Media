    "content": "( CNN ) For Martin O'Malley , the revival of Baltimore is at the core of his political biography . In a speech to Iowa Democrats last year , the former Maryland governor said that during his seven years as Baltimore mayor , he transformed what was once `` the most violent , most addicted , most abandoned city in America . ''\nWhat started as peaceful protests over the treatment of Freddie Gray \u2014 a 25-year-old African-American man who died while in police custody this month \u2014 erupted into full-blown violence . Racial tensions around the issue of police brutality bubbled to a full boil , as chaotic images of store lootings , destruction of property and buildings engulfed in flames captured the nation .\nThe violence in Maryland , which led the governor to declare a state of emergency , was clearly troubling for O'Malley . On Monday , he announced that he was cutting short a trip giving paid speeches in Ireland and returning home . `` I 'm saddened that the city I love is in such pain this night , '' he said in a statement .\nBut this week 's unrest in Baltimore could also have broader political consequences for the former governor as he mulls a presidential campaign . The events will likely bring greater scrutiny to O'Malley 's time as mayor \u2014 including his zero tolerance policing strategy , in which even minor offenses are vigorously prosecuted \u2014 while providing an opening for the former governor to inject himself into the national conversation about problems like crime , racial tensions and economic inequality that roil American cities .\nEven if the events in Baltimore raise his profile , however , O'Malley 's candidacy would be a long shot . He currently is registering in the single digits in national polls of possible Democratic presidential candidates .\nFormer Maryland Gov . Parris Glendening said Gray 's death \u2014 and the outrage surrounding it \u2014 calls for a `` national awakening '' on law enforcement and the treatment of racial minorities , and that O'Malley has `` tremendous credentials '' to lead a national dialogue on these issues .\n`` He understands what it is like to be the top elected official in a really challenging urban area , including the area of law enforcement , '' Glendening , a Democrat , said in an interview . `` What you 've got here is a powder keg in the sense that the community does n't trust the police and the police does n't trust the community , amidst a growing sense of poverty and inequity and hopelessness . ''\nIt 's unclear just how prominent a public role O'Malley will seek in the coming days , as current Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and Maryland Gov . Larry Hogan try to bring stability to a city in disarray . O'Malley spokeswoman Lis Smith said Tuesday that O'Malley has reached out to community leaders , including the mayor , to offer his help and that he 's ready to participate in the `` healing process with the people of Baltimore . ''\nBut the unrest in Baltimore could also hinder O'Malley 's ability to talk about the city as a success story .

And in recent public speeches , O'Malley has confronted head-on events that have reignited debates about racial discrimination and law enforcement tactics .\nSpeaking at the National Action Network summit in New York earlier this year , O'Malley discussed the killing of Walter Scott , an African-American man shot at eight times in the back by a South Carolina police officer .\n`` It 's very , very hard , I think , for white people , any white people , to understand just what that loss of a precious life does to the constant state of random vulnerability that Americans of color feel , '' he said .\nO'Malley also said that his tenure as mayor was not simply about cracking down on crime or the prevalence of drugs in the city but addressing a broader issue of justice for racial minorities .\n`` We vowed together that we would not only improve policing , not only raise the standard of justice in a colorblind way that valued every life in our city and every neighborhood equally , '' he said , `` but we would also intervene earlier in the lives of young people , expand drug treatment , and do one other very , very important thing -- and that is to do a better job of policing the police .
