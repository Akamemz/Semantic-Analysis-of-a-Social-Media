    "content": "DOUGLAS , Ariz. \u2014 In April , President Donald Trump announced he was ordering National Guard troops to the U.S. border with Mexico .\n\u201c We \u2019 re going to do some things militarily , \u201d Trump said . \u201c Until we can have a wall and proper security , we \u2019 re going to be guarding our border with the military . \u201d\nHere , in this dilapidated former mining town on the Mexican border , that vague directive has been translated \u2014 at least officially \u2014 to orders to help quell the smuggling operations in Agua Prieta across the fortified fence and in what is still regarded as one of America \u2019 s most corrupt locales .\nThey have been carrying out a variety of tasks assisting the U.S. Border Patrol in the months since their initial deployment , but all with one thing in common : They \u2019 re as far away from the border as possible . In reality , the hundreds of troops deployed in southern Arizona are keeping up the rear , so to speak ; in one assignment , soldiers are actually feeding and shoveling out manure from the stalls of the Border Patrol \u2019 s horses .\nBack in April , Trump hailed the deployment as a \u201c big step , \u201d claiming , \u201c We really haven \u2019 t done that before , or certainly not very much before . \u201d\nBut that isn \u2019 t accurate , either : Both George W. Bush and Barack Obama sent the guard to the border under similar circumstances ; Bush in far larger numbers than Trump \u2014 some 6,000 compared with up to 4,000 now , and Obama to the tune of 1,200 .\nIn Arizona , at least , the troops are being kept at an even safer distance than during previous deployments , veterans of past missions say , and assigned supporting roles that can free up Border Patrol agents for field work .\n\u201c That is the biggest difference from last time , when they sent soldiers to a hill and said , \u2018 Hey , look towards the border , \u2019 \u201d Capt . Macario Mora of the Arizona National Guard explained to me on a recent visit to the Border Patrol 's Douglas Station , which is responsible for 40 miles of the mountainous border and nearly 1,500 square miles that includes Douglas \u2014 population about 17,000 \u2014 and its urban terrain of ramshackle homes , warehouses and junkyards .\n\u201c There is a false narrative that we are doing ride-alongs , \u201d Mora said . Indeed , the troops are not permitted to take part in patrols or to participate in any operations to detain the men , women and children being trafficked by criminal organizations across the border or trying to slip undetected into Douglas .\nNone of the troops are even armed \u2014 \u201c and there is no anticipation that will change , \u201d Mora told me .\nSome are helping wherever they can , such as those assigned to tend to the Border Patrol \u2019 s horses stabled in the area for mounted patrols ( everyone \u2019 s favorite is Snuggles the Mustang ) .\nOther soldiers , like Sgt . Jonathan Sanchez , 35 , a cook , are performing maintenance on the Border Patrol \u2019 s heavily used vehicles .\n\u201c We fix flats , \u201d he explained on a steamy afternoon after completing his shift in the motor pool a few miles north of town .\nOther troops with proper security clearances have also been given a crash course in how to monitor a network of remote cameras deployed along the border and report anything suspicious \u2014 all from the Border Patrol \u2019 s air-conditioned tactical operations center out on Highway 80 .\n\u201c Most have never run a surveillance system like this , \u201d said Staff Sgt . Thomas Cider .\nA few National Guard helicopters and crew have also been enlisted to join the Border Patrol fleet for aerial surveillance , but more troops are clearing vegetation , serving as office clerks and making basic repairs to Border Patrol facilities .\nThey are freeing up some of the 3,600 Border Patrol agents assigned to southern Arizona that normally carry out such tasks for enforcement duties .\nBut it is also a strategy to keep the troops out of trouble .\nSupervisory Agent Juan Curbelo , a 22-year veteran of the Border Patrol , recounted in the Douglas Station how criminal organizations on the other side of the border have grown more sophisticated and more violent as the U.S. has deployed additional personnel and new technology over the years to make illegal cross-border traffic more difficult .\n\u201c They scout us quite a bit from the south side , \u201d he reported .\nHe was here during the previous National Guard deployments and said that during each iteration the Border Patrol has been more innovative in finding useful things for the troops to do that keep them from interacting with people crossing the border illegally .\nThe reality , multiple officials related , is that the part-time soldiers are not well-suited for what is largely a law enforcement mission \u2014 and they worry that inexperienced weekend warriors might , for instance , mistakenly kill civilians or create an international incident .\n\u201c It definitely helps mitigate the risk of the National Guard running into conflict , \u201d Mora explained of what he called the \u201c much safer environment \u201d they are in , miles away from the actual border .\nIt \u2019 s a lesson learned from those previous National Guard deployments .\nIn 2006 , Bush sent 6,000 National Guard troops to the border \u2014 the first time military forces were expressly sent to help stanch illegal immigration , as opposed to the illegal drug trade .
