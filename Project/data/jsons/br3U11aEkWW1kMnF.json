The woman was an undocumented housekeeper from El Salvador who had come to file her tax returns at Casa de Maryland , which hosts two federally subsidized tax centers that help low-income workers file their taxes for free .\nSo far this year , the group has helped 198 unauthorized immigrants file their taxes . While the woman and her tax preparer , Earvin Gonzalez , worked , about a dozen immigrants clutched folders full of receipts and tax paperwork and waited patiently in line for their turn .\nUnauthorized workers aren \u2019 t eligible for benefits like the earned income tax credit \u2014 which is what the green box on the screen was warning Gonzalez about . Nor can they get Social Security or Medicare . But the IRS still wants unauthorized immigrants to file their taxes , and many of them do . The best estimates from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy , a Washington , DC , think tank , suggest about half of undocumented workers in the United States pay income taxes .\nFiling taxes helps immigrants create a paper trail to show when they entered the country and how long they \u2019 ve been contributing tax dollars . Many are hoping it will help them get legal status one day . That has happened in past reform efforts , and one of the first requirements is usually to prove that a person has been paying taxes . That was the case for the undocumented youth granted temporary work permits under President Obama \u2019 s deportation-relief program , known as DACA . With the new administration \u2019 s fixation on a border wall , however , their chance of getting papers is more remote than ever .\nMaria , whose name is being withheld because of her immigration status , handed a folder with tax documents from two jobs to Gonzalez . Her W-2 showed that a housecleaning company paid her $ 17,288 last year .\nThe Social Security number on the W-2 form is made up , Maria tells me , because she doesn \u2019 t have one . Her employer never asked for identification to verify it , she says . Instead , she has an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number ( ITIN ) , created by the IRS in 1996 so people who aren \u2019 t allowed to work in the United States could still file taxes on any money they earned . ( The IRS does not share ITIN information with immigration authorities . )\nThe agency doesn \u2019 t break down the number of tax returns filed this way , but in 2010 , it reported that about 3 million ITIN holders paid more than $ 870 million in income taxes . There are currently about 12 million unauthorized immigrants living in the United States , including children and the elderly .\nMaria said she applied for an ITIN number shortly after arriving illegally in the United States from El Salvador in 2009 . People told her that having a record of paying taxes would help her adjust her status if immigration reform happened and she was given a path to citizenship .\nComprehensive immigration reform failed in Congress , but Maria is still paying her taxes every year . \u201c I think it \u2019 s important , and all my relatives pay their taxes too , \u201d she said .\nThis year , her documents included two 1099 forms , for work Maria did as a contractor .\n\u201c What kind of jobs were these ? \u201d Gonzalez asks her in Spanish .\n\u201c After cleaning houses , I would go lay concrete in parking lots , \u201d she says .\nThose two jobs brought in a total of $ 24,845 last year , and Maria still needed to pay taxes on that income . Gonzalez entered some deductions , such as the $ 1,500 she spent on equipment to pour and level concrete and the 12,000 miles she drove between job sites . Maria , who is a single mom , claimed two dependents : her 16-year-old son and 13-year-old daughter . With her ITIN number , she was able to claim child tax credits , but not the earned income tax credit , the major federal tax credit for low-income working families .\nIn the end , Maria owed $ 1,131 in income taxes to the state of Maryland and $ 775 to the federal government .
