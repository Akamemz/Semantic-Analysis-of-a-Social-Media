Leer en Espa\u00f1ol .\nWhen a woman who didn \u2019 t speak English arrived at the overrun emergency room of a Brooklyn hospital last week , she was initially placed in a unit for patients who didn \u2019 t have the coronavirus .\nBut on Thursday , a doctor realized she had a cough and fever and should be treated for COVID-19 . The doctor brought her over to the coronavirus unit with a warning : \u201c Good luck . She speaks Hungarian . \u201d\nA medical resident who treated her believes she would have gotten better care if she spoke English .\nIn the ER , where no one has enough time , particularly now , the resident said he could tell that no one wanted to work with an interpreter to take down the woman \u2019 s medical history . He placed his phone on the woman \u2019 s shoulder and dialed the interpreter service on speakerphone . Between the N95 mask covering his mouth and the helmet covering his ears , it was difficult to speak clearly and to hear .\n\u201c When they asked what language , \u201d he said , \u201c I spent five minutes just yelling : \u2018 Hungarian ! Hungarian ! \u2019 And they were like , \u2018 Spanish ? \u2019 \u201d\nThe woman may have died even if she spoke English , but the episode and others like it demonstrate how those who speak a foreign language are at a disadvantage in New York City \u2019 s chaotic and crowded hospitals .\n\u201c It takes 10 minutes of sitting on the phone to get an interpreter , and that \u2019 s valuable time when you \u2019 re inundated , \u201d the resident said . \u201c So this utilitarian calculus kicks in . And the patients that are most mainstream get the best care . \u201d\nEven in normal times , those who don \u2019 t speak English have worse health outcomes for a range of routine procedures and can struggle to gain access to interpreters . Some research also shows that professional interpreters make clinically significant errors substantially less often than ad hoc interpreters , such as family members .\nThose gaps are magnified in times of crisis . \u2588\u2588\u2588 spoke to 11 New York City health care workers about their experiences caring for coronavirus patients who didn \u2019 t speak English . While their employers ranged from top-tier nonprofit facilities in Manhattan to safety net hospitals in Brooklyn , they all described broken communication and hastily improvised stopgaps .\nGet Our Top Investigations Subscribe to the Big Story newsletter .\nThey \u2019 re worried that language barriers will leave immigrants with COVID-19 in a particularly dire situation : alone , confused and without the appropriate care .\nOne doctor in the Bronx described a colleague working in his facility \u2019 s triage tent , trying to assess patients using the Google Translate app on his smartphone .\nIn another situation , the Brooklyn emergency room resident said he felt comfortable enough with Spanish that he decided to forgo an interpreter while taking the medical history of an incoming Hispanic patient . Her symptoms weren \u2019 t severe , but he thought she told him she had heart surgery three years ago , so he admitted her into the hospital because that put her at risk . Later , he realized she \u2019 d said she had heart surgery when she was 3 years old . If he had known that , he would \u2019 ve sent her home .\nA resident at another Brooklyn hospital treated a woman on Sunday who only spoke French Creole . The oxygen mask over her face meant the interpreter couldn \u2019 t fully understand her , the resident said , and the patient clearly remained very confused . She died the next day .\nA Manhattan hospital-based physician described how he calls interpreters on his cellphone outside patients \u2019 rooms and places the phone in his breast pocket so it doesn \u2019 t get covered in virus particles . Then he puts on a yellow protective gown over his scrubs and enters the room , standing at a distance from the patients . But all of these steps make it hard for the patient and the interpreter to hear each other . \u201c Then we tell them they have a virus that is killing people all over the world , \u201d he said . \u201c We tell them they can \u2019 t have any visitors , they can \u2019 t leave the room . And then we shut the door . \u201d\nRead More Taxpayers Paid Millions to Design a Low-Cost Ventilator for a Pandemic . Instead , the Company Is Selling Versions of It Overseas . As coronavirus sweeps the globe , there is not a single Trilogy Evo Universal ventilator \u2014 developed with government funds \u2014 in the U.S. stockpile . Meanwhile , Royal Philips N.V. has sold higher-priced versions to clients around the world .\nAbout 1 in 5 Americans speaks a language other than English at home , according to census data . Among New Yorkers , it \u2019 s 49 % . But with more than 40,000 confirmed coronavirus cases within New York City limits , when residents without a strong grasp of English get sick , providers point to a number of ways the language gap could lead to worse care . Patients well enough to go home may misunderstand their discharge instructions , causing them to not quarantine properly or to not return to the ER if they take a turn for the worse . Mistakes could be made during triage , as underlying conditions get overlooked .\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 has long been understood to require hospitals to provide access to language interpretation if they receive federal funding ( such as Medicare and Medicaid ) , with failure to do so considered \u201c discrimination by national origin. \u201d Regulations put in place in 2016 to implement part of the Affordable Care Act bolstered that mandate . Hospitals now must use a \u201c qualified interpreter \u201d \u2014 patients have the right to sue if they don \u2019 t \u2014 and the use of family members and bilingual but untrained staff is restricted . ( There are exceptions , like translating through family members in emergencies . )\nElena Langdon , former chair of the National Board of Certification for Medical Interpreters , said she recognizes doctors may be unable to always provide the quality of care they \u2019 d like to right now , but that equity and the right to interpretation can \u2019 t fall by the wayside . \u201c While it \u2019 s made more difficult by the situation , it doesn \u2019 t mean you don \u2019 t have to do it , \u201d she said . \u201c It \u2019 s a public health issue . \u201d\nShe said hospitals may need to have a staff member on site dedicated to coordinating language access .
