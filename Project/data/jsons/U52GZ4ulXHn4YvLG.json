Several official reports have identified bias at the BBC . Just this past September , broadcaster John Humphrys retired after 32 years on the BBC \u2019 s airwaves with a fierce blast at the \u201c institutional liberal bias \u201d he found there . On some issues he found that the network \u2019 s bias \u201c made the Kremlin circa 1950 look sophisticated . \u201d\nHumphrys says his bosses were devastated by the 2016 Brexit referendum .

Last week , Channel 4 \u2019 s news division had to apologize after its social-media accounts claimed that Johnson had discussed whether \u201c people of color \u201d should be allowed into Britain ; he actually had referred to \u201c people of talent . \u201d\nBut Channel 4 has been unrepentant in every other aspect of its coverage .
