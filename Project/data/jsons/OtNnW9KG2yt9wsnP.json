This isn \u2019 t as odd as it might look . The rebellion that McCain represented back in 1999 and 2000 was precisely what much of the country desired at the time , when Americans generally supported the policies of Bill Clinton , if not the man himself . Republicans were careful to tack to the center in their rhetoric , and the stakes seemed lower . Issues such as immigration and war and trade were divisive , but not wrenchingly so .

Rebelling against the G.O.P . establishment in 1999 meant defying the donor class on taxes and the religious right on social issues . But rebelling against it in 2016 meant defying the donor class on trade and immigration and siding with the religious right on social issues . The makeup of the Establishment had changed , and McCain had become part of it . His earlier fans sorted themselves accordingly .\nIf McCain , at times , seemed bitter , perhaps these immense shifts had something to do with it . Politicians , more than most people ( albeit less than pop stars ) , learn to cope with swings in the public mood , but those who have enjoyed a period of marked resonance , when everything they say triggers sympathetic reverberations with the masses , have it hard when that stretch runs out . You can recognize that stardom is evanescent , yet still yearn to get it back . McCain was going fairly strong in 2004 , when John Kerry was trying , without success , to entice him into joining the Democratic ticket , but the formula of 2000 could no longer work . What remained instead were unpalatable choices . He could give up on a presidential run , or he could make nice with the Republican Party .
