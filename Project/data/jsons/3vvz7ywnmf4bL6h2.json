In most of these surveys, respondents are interviewed only once. This model of conducting surveys is facing serious challenges as response rates drop, costs increase and newer alternative methods present appealing alternatives.\n\nOne alternative that is hardly new, but is attracting renewed attention, is the panel survey. Panel surveys involve repeated interviews with the same pool of respondents over time. Panels have been around for decades, and high-quality, probability-based panels (those recruited through random samples of the population) are an integral part of the federal statistical system. Panels recruited through non-probability methods or \u201cconvenience\u201d samples have found widespread applicability in the market research world. But with a very small number of notable exceptions, panels have not been widely used by organizations committed to conducting probability-based political and social surveys on a regular basis. This is changing.\n\nSeveral features of panels make them an appealing alternative to one-time, \u201ccross-sectional\u201d surveys. The initial costs of recruiting a panel, while potentially large, can be amortized over time because the panel can yield multiple individual surveys at relatively lower marginal costs per survey. Over time, far more can be learned about the panelists\u2019 social, demographic and political characteristics than is feasible in a single survey.

Some attempt to be representative of the entire population, while others focus on subgroups such as teens or young adults.
