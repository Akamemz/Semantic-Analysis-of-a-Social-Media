Lou Barletta is hoping Trump's recent run of successful election suggestions continues in the Pennsylvania Republican Senate primary.\n\nBarletta is heavily favored over state Rep. Jim Christiana to become the Republican challenger for Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, who is seeking a third term in November.\n\nBarletta was a Trump supporter before the 2016 presidential nomination was settled. The loyalty won Barletta Trump's early support in the Senate race, as well as recorded telephone calls last weekend featuring the president backing Barletta \"fully, strongly and proudly.\"\n\nLast week, Trump urged GOP Senate primary voters to support Rep.

But, for the first time, Omaha-area Democrats have options for the state's lone urban House district.\n\nTuesday's Democratic primary in Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District, dominated by Omaha and its suburbs, features moderate former Rep. Brad Ashford fighting for his old seat and Kara Eastman, a children's nonprofit administrator, running to Ashford's left.\n\nAshford, a former Republican, served one term in Congress as a Democrat before Republican Don Bacon beat him for re-election in 2016.

Knute Buehler and retired Navy pilot Greg Wooldridge have emerged as leaders in fundraising and GOP straw polls. However, Democratic Gov. Kate Brown remains the favorite to win in November. Brown became governor in 2015 upon the resignation of Gov.
