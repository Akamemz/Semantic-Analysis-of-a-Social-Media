    "content": "Some suggest that Congress \u201c remove Trump from office , so that he can not abuse incumbency to subvert the electoral process , but let the American people make the judgment on whether or not he gets a second term\u2026 Removing Trump from office for the remainder of his term would disable him from abusing presidential power again and protect the integrity of the electoral process from inappropriate interference . At the same time , letting him run for a second term would permit the American electorate to decide whether Trump , despite his attempt to subvert the system , should have another chance\u2026 Decoupling removal from disqualification lowers the stakes and changes the constitutional calculus . As long as Trump can run again , Republicans can not hide behind a claim that they are [ the ] ones protecting voter choice by opposing impeachment. \u201d Edward B. Foley , Politico\n\u201c In the absence of an explicit quid pro quo over restarting aid , the context and circumstances are what will become the focus of the investigation . There is enough here to support impeachment . Whether it is also enough to convince Republicans and lead to removal is another matter. \u201d Noah Feldman , Bloomberg\n\u201c Trump \u2019 s defenders will say this evidence is all circumstantial . But circumstantial evidence is not weak evidence : it \u2019 s simply evidence based on the circumstances in which an act of wrongdoing is committed \u2014 such as the license plate of a car that speeds away from a bank just after that bank is robbed . Criminals are convicted on such evidence all the time . They will also say that there \u2019 s no explicit quid pro quo proposal here . But\u2026 \u2018 even when a corrupt deal is struck implicitly , the government can still prosecute extortion on a quid pro quo basis . Circumstantial evidence can be enough to prove a criminal exchange. \u2019 \u2026\n\u201c In February , authorities arrested the United States coast guard Lieutenant Christopher Hasson , an alleged rightwing extremist who , reports say , had placed Omar ( among others ) on a hit list\u2026 And just last week , a man from western New York was arrested for allegedly threatening to kill the Minnesota congresswoman . In scoring their cheap political points , Fox News and the New York Post and the president of the United States himself are directly contributing to a perilous climate of vigilantism that threatens not only Omar but really every Muslim in America today. \u201d Moustafa Bayoumi , The Guardian\n\u201c GOP Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel responded by calling Omar \u2018 anti-American. \u2019 Fox & Friends host Brian Kilmeade said that \u2018 you have to wonder if she is an American first. \u2019 ... [ Last month Fox News Host Jeanine Pirro argued ] that Omar isn \u2019 t a true American because she wears a hijab . \u2018 Omar wears a hijab , which according to the Quran , 33:59 , tells women to cover so they won \u2019 t [ be ] molested , \u2019 she said . \u2018 Is her adherence to this Islamic doctrine indicative of her adherence to sharia law , which is antithetical to the U.S. Constitution ? \u2019 \u2026 It shouldn \u2019 t be hard to understand that pushing such a pointed message that people like Omar are at war with American values can lead to violence. \u201d Ryan Bort , Rolling Stone\n\u201c Since 2001 , Muslim Americans have increasingly dealt with Islamophobia and threats of violence against them . The two most recent FBI reports on hate crimes showed that anti-Muslim assaults are at record levels in the United States , hovering at three times higher than they did a decade ago . Just this week , an Ohio chapter of CAIR asked the FBI to investigate after it received a threatening letter praising the New Zealand attacks as something that brought \u2018 tremendous joy \u2019 and calling for \u2018 Death to Islam everywhere. \u2019 \u2026 The fearmongering tweets Trump and others pushed out in the wake of Omar \u2019 s speech serve as yet more pieces of fuel for this fire. \u201d Samantha Michaels , Mother Jones\n\u201c I \u2019 m reminded of Cardinal Richelieu \u2019 s quote : \u2018 If you give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest of men , I will find something in them which will hang him. \u2019 Omar isn \u2019 t even being afforded six words\u2026 While some in the GOP are trying to use this moment to score cheap political points , Omar has been working hard to advance the 9/11 Victim \u2019 s Compensation Fund\u2026 [ But ] the most frustrating thing about this latest spasm of conservative backlash is the way it obscures Omar \u2019 s actual point about civil rights . \u201d Qasim Rashid , NBC News\n\u201c Omar was not downplaying 9/11 , she was simply pointing out the injustice of all 1.8 billion Muslims worldwide being blamed for a small number of people committing a horrible atrocity \u2026 The only thing you could quibble with is Omar saying that CAIR \u2014 a blandly inoffensive Muslim rights organization akin to the NAACP , which conservatives nevertheless constantly accuse of being affiliated with terrorism or itself terrorist \u2014 was founded after 9/11 , when in fact it was founded in 1994 . ( Though it did dramatically step up its advocacy after 9/11 , for obvious reasons . ) \u201d Ryan Cooper , The Week\nThe left argues that Omar \u2019 s comments were taken out of context , and condemns the over-the-top rhetoric being used against her .\nThe right condemns Omar \u2019 s comments and criticizes accusations of incitement against her critics .\nThe right condemns Omar \u2019 s comments and criticizes accusations of incitement against her critics .\n\u201c Is this the most important thing happening in the world ? Not remotely . But it \u2019 s not asking too much from any elected representative to show that basic decency when they speak . Rep. Omar didn \u2019 t manage to do that . Maybe she misspoke . If so , it would be easy to say so , express a little respect for the dead and move on . But we \u2019 re not seeing that . Instead , Omar and her friends AOC and Rep. Tlaib and Vox and the Washington Post are claiming criticism of her language is an attempt to get her killed\u2026\n\u201c Not one of the people on the left parroting this idea ( that criticism incites violence ) has shown any such concern about their own speech . When they spent the last 2 years claiming the president was a compromised Russian stooge , did you ever hear them hesitate on the grounds that someone might try to kill Trump ? They did not . And neither should critics of Rep. Omar . \u201d\n\u201c Last year , many in the liberal press applauded the public abuse of Trump officials in restaurants . This was the people having their voice ! Even Democratic members of Congress urged this kind of direct action . Can they really claim that public confrontation with politicians is less likely to lead to violence than criticism of a Muslim politician \u2019 s speech ? If telling people to get in GOP officials \u2019 faces isn \u2019 t incitement to violence \u2014 and it isn \u2019 t \u2014 then how can criticism of a congresswoman euphemizing the attacks of 9/11 possibly be ? \u2026\n\u201c Omar has been the subject of death threats , including the arrest of one man . Perhaps Omar \u2019 s critics should take extra care in framing their attacks . But Omar is a public figure , a politician thrust into vast prominence and influence . She has to be fair game for direct criticism . And her identity can not be allowed to transform a plain political attack into an incitement to violence . \u201d\nComparisons between Omar \u2019 s statements and those made by President Bush at Ground Zero imply \u201c that President Bush said something comparable to her \u2018 some people did something \u2019 riff , but the implied analogy is nonexistent . Bush vowed to destroy the terrorists who attacked the U.S. Omar suggested that the terrorist attacks were of little consequence except insofar as they prompted an alleged backlash against Muslims\u2013by President Bush , presumably . The two statements could hardly be more different . \u201d\nSome , however , argue that \u201c Omar 's words were poorly chosen\u2026 But I suspect Omar 's intent was not malicious or derisory . Rather , I believe Omar was attempting to draw divergence between her Islamic faith and the al Qaeda fanatics who carried out the 9/11 attacks . When she says that \u2018 some people \u2019 did it , she meant \u2018 some people who are not us \u2019 or \u2018 not like us , \u2019 referring to herself and peaceful , mainstream adherents of Islam in the U.S\u2026 Maybe I 'm wrong , but I think that was her key point : al Qaeda are not us , and their evil should not be used to collectively punish Muslims . You do n't have to approve of CAIR or Omar to appreciate the legitimacy of this idea . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s worth noting that \u201c conservative ideas were much more popular when not associated with the Republican party . In Washington State , voters narrowly rejected bringing affirmative action back to state contracting and university admissions\u2026 \u200d \u201c In Seattle , the self-proclaimed socialist city-council member appears to have lost her seat to a pro-business challenger . In Colorado , voters gave fiscal conservatives a big win by rejecting letting the state keep any tax revenues above the state spending cap , money that the state Taxpayer \u2019 s Bill of Rights currently guarantees as refunds to taxpayers . In Sussex County , N.J. , voters approved , by a 2-to-1 margin , a referendum directing the local freeholder board to cooperate with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement . ( Washington , Colorado , New Jersey \u2014 notice these are places where Republican candidates have had no luck lately . ) \u201d\n\u201c If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday\u2014shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production\u2014imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy . In recent decades , the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment . Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors ? \u2026 the nation does not want another war . How we avoid it , however , is becoming difficult to see .
