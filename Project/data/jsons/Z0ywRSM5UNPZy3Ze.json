    "content": "Before a June hearing , top Pentagon brass responded to leading legislative proposals . Pentagon wins Round 1 in assault fight\nThe country \u2019 s most senior military commanders filed into a Capitol Hill hearing room in June , sat in front of TV cameras and promised to stamp out military sexual assault \u2014 a problem Army chief of staff Gen. Ray Odierno called \u201c a cancer . \u201d\n\u201c We can and will do better , \u201d Odierno told the senators .\nBut privately , Pentagon lawyers and advisers were trying to limit just how much they \u2019 d have to do .\nOver the past three months , Pentagon lawyers and legislative officials met with senior lawmakers and aides , including the Senate Armed Services Committee staff director and its top lawyer , to persuade them to shut down a movement led by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( D-N.Y. ) to take the chain of command out of sexual assault cases .\nFederal agencies plead their case to Congress all the time , so that \u2019 s not unusual . Senators on the committee argue that they wouldn \u2019 t be doing their jobs if they didn \u2019 t weigh the Pentagon \u2019 s view . \u201c I \u2019 ve had an awful lot of generals on that couch that are professing with sincerity that they realize that this is something they can no longer assume will take care of itself , or that there \u2019 s just a training issue , \u201d Sen. Claire McCaskill ( D-Mo . ) said in an interview in her Capitol Hill office .\nBut in this case , the Pentagon \u2019 s lobbying machine went further than usual on a legislative fight , ratcheting up in-person meetings with key senators and even sending lawyers to negotiate , an unusual step longtime Hill aides said .\nPentagon lawyers even combed through dozens of alternatives offered by the committee staff , picking and choosing among ideas to include in the bill and nixing the ones viewed as cracking down too hard , several sources involved in drafting the bill tell \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nA new prosecution system to enforce major crimes . Faster jury trials . A new rule that would ban all sexual contact between instructors and trainees , a recurring problem . All out .\nWhat did the lawyers give in return ? Steps the Pentagon says it \u2019 s already taking , such as barring commanders from overturning jury convictions .\nThat means if the negotiated package becomes law , it won \u2019 t amount to much of an overhaul since most of the toughest steps Congress will have asked the Pentagon to take in 25 years of promising to solve the problem aren \u2019 t even new .\nThe edited package already sailed through Chairman Carl Levin \u2019 s Armed Services Committee in June . It defeated Gillibrand \u2019 s measure to remove sexual assault cases from the chain of command , a proposal that she is now taking to the full Senate .\nGillibrand \u2019 s measure is picking up momentum , with Republican Sens . Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas announcing at a Tuesday news conference that they \u2019 re signing on as co-sponsors .\nBut the military \u2019 s maneuvering in committee is a reminder that Gillibrand is confronting what many Democrats and Republicans have seen before her : The Pentagon rarely loses on Capitol Hill .\nJust look at the military \u2019 s track record so far : This wasn \u2019 t a routine ask for more money for a weapons project , backed by a senator or two with a home-state interest , but a top-to-bottom reshaping of a measure meant to force the Pentagon to solve a problem that \u2019 s been festering for more than two decades , despite intensifying congressional scrutiny from both parties and growing public outrage over fresh rounds of headlines documenting sexual misconduct in the ranks .\nPlus , the Pentagon is still going full speed ahead . Military officials are working the phones and meeting with senators of both parties who don \u2019 t serve on the Armed Services Committee , urging them to oppose Gillibrand , according to a Defense Department source .\nMcCaskill , a chief backer of Levin \u2019 s package , said Tuesday she plans to encourage senators to hear from retired military lawyers , too .\nMcCaskill is also cheering the package itself , pointing to language stripping commanders of the ability to overturn jury verdicts and making it a criminal offense to retaliate against victims who report alleged crimes \u2014 changes she says will improve how sexual assault cases are handled . Even supporters of Gillibrand \u2019 s alternative do not oppose the other measure , but simply argue it does not go far enough .\nAnd the Pentagon has a second line of defense . Even if Gillibrand pulls off an upset victory in the Senate , the measure is expected to hit a wall in the Republican-controlled House . The House bill includes similar language to Levin \u2019 s alternative , and there is no serious push to remove cases from the chain of command in the lower chamber .\nWhen the two bills meet in conference , many observers expect the Gillibrand proposal would be stripped out to ensure the bill \u2014 considered a must-pass because it authorizes funding for the Pentagon \u2014 will still pass in the House .\n\u201c There \u2019 s understandably deference given to people who have spent their entire lives in the service , \u201d said Sen. Susan Collins ( R-Maine ) . \u201c The military does many things extremely well , but it \u2019 s done an extremely poor job of dealing with this problem . And , I don \u2019 t think we can defer to the military \u2019 s views on this issue given their poor track record . \u201d\nWhen asked if the Pentagon scuttled the chain of command provision , Collins , an original co-sponsor of the measure , replied : \u201c Clearly . \u201d\nBut not everyone agrees that cooperation is a bad thing .\nLevin defended the work of his committee and the Pentagon .\n\u201c We don \u2019 t demur to the agencies . We \u2019 re responsible for legislation . They \u2019 ve got their responsibility . We have ours . They want us to do things we don \u2019 t do . We don \u2019 t rubber-stamp their budget by any stretch of the imagination , \u201d Levin said in an interview , noting that the items in his legislation came from about 30 senators .\nMcCaskill a former county prosecutor , believes the military hierarchy \u2014 and Pentagon buy-in \u2014 is critical to solving the problem of sexual assault .\n\u201c There \u2019 s an honest disagreement over which version is going to protect sexual assault victims better , \u201d McCaskill said . \u201c I want to make sure everybody understands what this is about , I mean , I think people know I \u2019 m not into coddling the Pentagon . I think they know I \u2019 m a real sex-crimes prosecutor .

James Amos and Air Force chief of staff Gen.
