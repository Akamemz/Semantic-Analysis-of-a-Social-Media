    "content": "The Cuyahoga River , which slices through downtown Cleveland twice , caught fire in the 1950s and 1960s .\nThere is so much dread and acrimony about the GOP presidential contest , one wonders if the Republican convention in Cleveland could be the scene of a similar conflagration .\nTalk of a brokered or contested convention abounds . Angst paralyzes some Republican lawmakers about the prospects of Donald Trump or Sen. Ted Cruz , R-Texas , heading the GOP ticket . There \u2019 s worry about outright discord and no clear winner come convention time .\nIs it any wonder some Republicans briefly launched an effort to recruit House Speaker Rep. Paul Ryan , R-Wis. , to seek the presidency ?\nFormer U.S . Ambassador to Finland Earle Mack wanted to garner one million online signatures to compel Ryan to run .\n\u201c If you do not get 1,238 delegates on the first ballot , then the confusion starts . The chaos starts , \u201d Mack told the Fox Business Network . \u201c Because of the disarray , they would need someone to heal it . And that would be Paul Ryan . \u201d\nThe speaker \u2019 s political team wasn \u2019 t amused . Ryan \u2019 s counsel , Timothy Kronquist , sent a letter to the Federal Election Commission on Monday disavowing the organization .\nKronquist followed up with a cease-and-desist letter Thursday to the pro-Ryan group . The dispatch accused the outfit of giving voters the impression its activities are \u201c in coordination with Speaker Ryan . \u201d\nKronquist noted that Ryan repeatedly said he isn \u2019 t running for president .\nOf course , Ryan was also adamant that he wasn \u2019 t running for speaker of the House \u2026\nAn effort to quash political activity even if Ryan doesn \u2019 t support the draft effort ? Weren \u2019 t Republicans lathered up when they accused the IRS of trying to temper political activities ? Where \u2019 s Lois Lerner ?\nBy Friday afternoon , the pro-Ryan group halted its efforts . It issued a statement saying the recruitment mission \u201c could become an unwanted distraction from the Speaker \u2019 s current responsibilities . \u201d\nHowever , the group argued that \u201c in an open convention , the best person to lead our country would be Speaker Paul Ryan . \u201d\nRyan \u2019 s done all he can to distance himself from chatter of a brokered convention .\n\u201c That \u2019 s ridiculous , \u201d Ryan exclaimed in January when asked about the likelihood of the brokered convention scenario . When asked if he could guarantee there wouldn \u2019 t be a fight in Cleveland , he replied \u201c How would I know ? \u201d\nHouse Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , knows the risks Republicans would face at a multi-ballot confab .\n\u201c If they think that they \u2019 re going to upset the verdict of the people in terms of the elections , that can really be opening a very big Pandora \u2019 s Box , \u201d she said . \u201c I think that you change that to your peril . \u201d\nThe GOP \u2019 s political consternation over the top of the ticket translates to a legislative frailty on Capitol Hill .\nThis angst and division in the party is crystalized in the current fight in Congress to approve a budget -- and maybe spending bills later this year .\n\u201c We believe we have an obligation , a duty , to offer another way forward . To offer an alternative , \u201d Ryan said in January .\nRyan talked repeatedly about how \u201c Americans want progress \u201d and said he \u2019 s \u201c really excited about \u201c being bold . \u201d\nHe codified 2016 is \u201c a year of ideas. \u201d The speaker said he wants to \u201c offer our fellow citizens solutions . \u201d\nLofty rhetoric . But the GOP is struggling with the budget . No budget and it \u2019 s hard for Congress to crank through the 12 annual spending bills that fund the government .\nThese can be the basic -- at times boring -- mechanics of Congress . And it \u2019 s challenging to match soaring talk about agendas and ideas when the oratory of the Republican presidential frontrunner focuses on the size of his jockstrap .\nThe success of Donald Trump and recalcitrance of House conservatives is now giving Ryan the same headaches encountered by former Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio .\n`` Speaker Ryan is the ultimate optimist , and the job has only energized him , '' spokeswoman AshLeeStrong said Saturday .\nRepublicans may yet try to advance an annual budget through committee next week and on the House floor later this month . Rank-and-file House Republicans huddle in the Capitol basement late Monday afternoon to assess matters .\nMoving soon is important if the House is to actually knock out spending bills this year and truly legislate .\nThat would prevent cramming everything into an ugly , omnibus measure in December . But a failure to move any sort of budget doesn \u2019 t match Ryan \u2019 s bold agenda talk . It could be a significant embarrassment for the speaker since he \u2019 s touted as the \u201c numbers \u201d guy .\nIn fact , the die for Ryan and this budget may have already been cast the day before he became speaker .\nLast October , the House voted 266-167 to establish topline spending numbers for the current budget cycle and the one that now stymies the House .\nBoehner engineered that agreement with President Obama . It set the annual appropriations figure ( often called \u201c discretionary \u201d spending ) for fiscal 2017 at $ 1.070 trillion . That meant Congress would then fillet the $ 1.070 trillion among the 12 annual spending bills to run the government .\nBut examine the October , 28 , 2015 , roll call . Of the 266 yea votes , Republicans only provided 79 . Boehner and Ryan were among that group .\nNow , conservatives demand Ryan boot the $ 1.070 trillion figure in favor of $ 1.040 trillion .\nIf the leadership had the votes , they would have moved the budget through committee and onto the floor a few weeks ago .\nHouse Majority Whip Rep. Steve Scalise , R-La. , whipped the budget last week . There \u2019 s no formal green light just yet despite a hope of action soon .\nRep. Bill Flores , R-Texas , chairman the Republican Study Committee , the largest bloc of conservatives in the House -- roughly 170 members of the 246 member House GOP conference .\n\u201c I have not backed off , \u201d Flores said . \u201c I \u2019 m not endorsing $ 1.070 trillion . \u201d\nHowever , he did say a plan which helped with broader savings -- even while sticking to $ 1.070 trillion -- might be worth considering .\n\u201c You have to look at the whole picture , \u201d Flores said .\nThere are also political considerations . A number of incumbent Texas Republicans were jumpy about their primaries earlier this month . There was concern that voting for a budget at the higher level could lend ammo to their opponents .\nBut all Texas GOPers won and avoided runoffs . So , the delay may help .\nRyan still hasn \u2019 t solved the most-pervasive problem in the House Republican Conference . It \u2019 s an issue that dogged his predecessor .\n\u201c There are about 100 people here who would vote no and hope yes , \u201d said one knowledgeable source .\nThat flies in the face of a memo Scalise penned to his colleagues in November .\n\u201c Too many in our conference are falling into the pattern of voting no on tough bills while actually hoping the bill passes because they know that the outcome will be even worse if the bill fails , \u201d he wrote .\nFailing to adopt a budget cripples the House from completing most spending bills . No bold agenda there . And it \u2019 s awkward for Republicans -- and Ryan in particular -- who browbeat Senate Democrats for not adopting budgets .\nMembers of the House \u2019 s ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus would like $ 30 billion in immediate cuts to entitlement programs such as Medicare , Medicaid and Social Security . It is unclear how such cuts could impact current beneficiaries .\nGOP Rep. Dave Brat , R-Va. , wants to curb the entitlements in appropriations bills , though that violates the much-vaunted \u201c regular order \u201d by running afoul of multiple budget rules and regulations .\n\u201c I am a strong supporter of cutting mandatory spending , just not on Appropriations bills , \u201d said Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers , R-Ky. \u201c Any such attempt would stop the appropriations process in its tracks -- risking the passage of appropriations bills in the House , in the Senate , and most certainly White House approval .\n\u201c This would ultimately lead us once again to Continuing Resolutions and an omnibus , which is the opposite of the \u2018 regular order \u2019 we are all seeking to achieve . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s typical to alter entitlements via a special budget process called \u201c reconciliation. \u201d Reconciliation usually comes later in the year . But the House can \u2019 t employ the reconciliation maneuver unless it approves a budget . Still , Brat and other conservatives are skeptical about waiting .\n\u201c I prefer to see ( changes ) in appropriations because they come first , \u201d he said . \u201c I have to see it in writing . \u201d\n\u201c I haven \u2019 t heard anything that would change my mind , \u201d he said . \u201c It \u2019 s always a hope and a prayer .
