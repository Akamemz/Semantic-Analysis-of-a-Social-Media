    "content": "On Saturday night in Tulsa , Oklahoma , President Donald Trump tried to relaunch his reelection campaign . This was his chance , after the onslaught of the novel coronavirus and three months without a campaign rally , to tell Americans what he would do in a second term . The election , he argued , was about defeating an array of enemies : anarchists , journalists , Democrats , and \u201c millions and millions of illegal aliens. \u201d But the common theme was enmity itself . Trump can \u2019 t run on four more years of prosperity . So he \u2019 s running on four more years of strife .\nAt the rally , Trump shrugged off the 120,000 Americans killed by the virus , joking that he preferred to test fewer people so fewer infections would be found . He said he had shaken hands with children in the arena . This was no big deal , he opined , because if a kid got sick , he \u2019 d \u201c recover in about 15 minutes. \u201d Critics \u201c always blame a president , \u201d Trump scoffed . \u201c Other than all of the horrible , horrible death , \u201d he concluded , \u201c people are going to say , \u2018 Man , this guy is doing a good job . \u2019 \u201d\nInstead of talking about his accomplishments , Trump devoted his speech to skewering people he didn \u2019 t like .
