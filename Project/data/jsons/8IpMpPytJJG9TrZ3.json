    "content": "Documents and interviews reveal new details about a pattern of sexual harassment by a senior Justice Department official , and what the department did \u2014 and did not do \u2014 in the year since he resigned .\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In December 2018 , the Justice Department \u2019 s inspector general dropped a bombshell : Investigators had \u201c substantiated \u201d allegations that a senior DOJ official was a repeat sexual harasser . The official , who had retired by that point , harassed five women under his chain of command , the inspector general announced . One woman reported that she was not only harassed , but also sexually assaulted . Another woman reported that she was pressured into having sex to get a promotion . Few details were available at the time . The inspector general \u2019 s summary of the investigation was barely two pages . The official had worked in the Office of Justice Programs , an arm of the Justice Department that partners with federal , state , and local law enforcement , but he wasn \u2019 t identified . The summary didn \u2019 t specify what the women accused him of doing or the time period . Because the official had left the department , there wouldn \u2019 t be any internal disciplinary process . No criminal charges were filed . Nearly 10 months later , \u2588\u2588\u2588 obtained a copy of the inspector general \u2019 s full report . The 12-page document is redacted but includes a slew of new information , including detailed accounts from two of the women who described a pattern of escalating workplace harassment , as well as investigators \u2019 findings that the former official \u201c lacked credibility \u201d and provided \u201c conflicting testimony. \u201d The former official \u2019 s name is redacted in the inspector general \u2019 s report , but \u2588\u2588\u2588 previously identified him as Edison Aponte , who had worked at DOJ since 1994 , according to a Justice Department spokesperson . Aponte \u2019 s most recent title was associate deputy director in the Bureau of Justice Assistance , a section within the Office of Justice Programs that provides law enforcement training and grants \u2014 including , several sources noted , on issues related to victims of sexual assault and domestic violence .\n\u201c It boggles the mind , \u201d said Jon Adler , who took over as the head of the Bureau of Justice Assistance in late 2017 . By then , the inspector general \u2019 s investigation was underway and Aponte had been placed on leave . A source with firsthand knowledge of the investigation originally confirmed Aponte \u2019 s identity to \u2588\u2588\u2588 in December . Reached by phone in December , Aponte said he could not confirm the inspector general \u2019 s report was about him and hung up . Since then , four current and former Office of Justice Programs employees with firsthand knowledge of the investigation have confirmed that the official described in the inspector general \u2019 s report is Aponte . \u2588\u2588\u2588 also reviewed documents that refer to events described in the report that name him . Aponte did not respond to multiple attempts to reach him for comment in the past month . One woman told the inspector general \u2019 s office that Aponte \u2019 s behavior began with inappropriate comments and unwanted touching \u2014 she said she put a mirror in her cubicle because he would come up behind her and rub her shoulders \u2014 and said he eventually raped her . Aponte denied the assault , but told investigators they had sex .\nAnother woman told investigators that it started with suggestive comments over drinks . Aponte once took her to a topless bar and asked her what sexual positions she liked , she said . She later felt pressured into a sexual relationship to secure a promotion ; he knew she was struggling financially , she said . Aponte denied that relationship . A third woman told investigators she engaged in a consensual sexual relationship with Aponte . The inspector general concluded that the relationship was still harassment because he was her supervisor ; he should have notified his superior about the relationship and stepped aside as the women \u2019 s supervisor to avoid even the appearance of a \u201c loss of impartiality , \u201d but failed to do so , according to the report . Two other women reported \u201c uncomfortable \u201d encounters with him . One of the women who reported being harassed \u2014 the one who said he pressured her to have sex in order to get a promotion \u2014 received a financial settlement from the Justice Department , a source with firsthand knowledge of the agreement told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . The woman and her lawyer declined an interview request .\n`` They didn \u2019 t do anything when I went to them . ... They protected him and they allowed it . ''\nThe woman who reported that Aponte sexually harassed and raped her agreed to speak with \u2588\u2588\u2588 on the condition that she only be identified by her initials , S.C. She said she felt ignored and abandoned by department officials after she first reported being harassed by him in 2012 . She \u2019 s still angry about how the department handled her situation , and said the fact that Aponte is gone and the inspector general made a public finding of wrongdoing wasn \u2019 t a satisfying resolution .\n\u201c What he did to those other people , management allowed to have happened \u2014 because they didn \u2019 t do anything when I went to them . They allowed that . They protected him and they allowed it , \u201d she said . The report doesn \u2019 t say what happened in the year after the investigation ended , but \u2588\u2588\u2588 reviewed documents and interviewed sources inside the department that fill in the timeline . A senior human resources manager told the employees union in January that new \u201c mandatory \u201d sexual harassment training for all Office of Justice Programs employees would begin in the spring and that management would consult with the union on a new sexual harassment policy . However , three sources \u2014 a union official , a former senior official at OJP , and a current employee \u2014 told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that none of that has happened to date . A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment . Sexual harassment hasn \u2019 t just been a problem in one office at the Justice Department . In May 2017 , the inspector general \u2019 s office alerted then\u2013deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein to \u201c potential systemic issues \u201d across DOJ . From 2012 to 2016 , for instance , the inspector general released summaries of 19 substantiated complaints that included sexual misconduct and either involved high-level DOJ officials or were otherwise of \u201c significant public interest. \u201d Those and other internal investigations highlighted problems with how sexual harassment was being tracked and punished , the inspector general told Rosenstein . A year later , Rosenstein issued a memo directing every office to follow new guidelines for how to address sexual harassment . The memo outlined \u201c guiding principles \u201d for harassment policies and how to punish misconduct . All offices were given 90 days to come up with a system to track complaints . In a June letter to the US Commission on Civil Rights , which has been reviewing sexual harassment in the federal government , the Justice Department \u2019 s Gender Equality Network ( DOJ GEN ) , an employee group , said it was \u201c encouraged \u201d by Rosenstein \u2019 s memo , but it wasn \u2019 t enough . \u201c DOJ GEN believes DOJ must do more to strengthen its sexual harassment and misconduct policies and to ensure that DOJ employees who experience sexual harassment or misconduct are not dismissed and ignored , \u201d the group wrote . Representatives of DOJ GEN declined to comment .\nThe inspector general \u2019 s office began its investigation into Aponte after receiving information in March 2017 from the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees 2830 , the union that represents Office of Justice Programs employees . Aponte was placed on administrative leave at that time , according to a department spokesperson . The report was finished in late October 2018 , just over a month before the office publicly announced its summary of the investigation on Dec. 4 , 2018 .\nNearly 10 months after \u2588\u2588\u2588 filed a public records request for the full report , the inspector general \u2019 s office produced it in late September . The office withheld certain information , citing privacy concerns , so the full extent of what investigators learned remains secret . The unredacted sections of the report don \u2019 t include dates , so there \u2019 s no definite timeline for when the harassment alleged by each of the women began . The report is divided into sections detailing each woman \u2019 s account . The first woman provided a letter to investigators describing a sexual relationship with Aponte and indicated that he was her supervisor throughout that relationship . Aponte initially told the inspector general \u2019 s office he didn \u2019 t have a sexual relationship with the woman , but when confronted with information from her letter , he admitted it . \u201c [ REDACTED ] admitted to the OIG that he exercised bad judgment , especially in view of his position as an [ REDACTED ] , \u201d according to the report , an apparent reference to Aponte \u2019 s position as a senior manager . \u201c [ REDACTED ] admitted that he should not have been involved with his female subordinates in any way that would appear that he was violating ethical rules . [ REDACTED ] admitted further that he had inappropriate relationships with subordinates , and that his communications with them were unprofessional. \u201d The second woman described in the inspector general \u2019 s report was S.C. , who fell under Aponte \u2019 s chain of command in the Bureau of Justice Assistance . She told investigators and , later , \u2588\u2588\u2588 that she tried to discourage sexual advances from Aponte , which included repeatedly asking her about her dating life and uninvited touching \u2014 she was the one who said she put up a mirror at her desk to deal with unwanted back rubs from Aponte . S.C. also told investigators that Aponte once sexually assaulted her . She said that Aponte followed her home after they had gone as part of a group to an unspecified sports event , and asked to come inside to use the bathroom and for a tour . According to the report , she said that when she rejected his attempts to touch her , he became \u201c forceful \u201d and \u201c sexually assaulted her by having sexual intercourse with her. \u201d Aponte initially denied any sexual relationship with S.C. , but he later said he \u2019 d had sex with her while he was her supervisor , according to the report . He denied assaulting her . The report noted that no criminal charges were filed against Aponte . S.C. told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that she decided not to go to the police because she didn \u2019 t want to bring attention to herself or her family . Throughout the interview , S.C. also described being concerned about hurting Aponte \u2019 s family . The inspector general \u2019 s description of the third woman \u2019 s account was brief , and the redactions make it hard to know what exactly happened . Still , the report appears to show that the incident involved Aponte showing a photo to other people and that it made her feel \u201c very uncomfortable. \u201d The fourth woman told investigators that Aponte knew she was \u201c struggling financially \u201d and that she hoped for a promotion . She said she accepted his invitations for several months to get drinks outside of work \u2014 on one occasion , she said , he took her to a topless bar , and after asking her about what sexual positions she liked , she told him to \u201c go to hell and left. \u201d Aponte told investigators he didn \u2019 t remember the incident . At a Christmas party some time later , the woman told investigators that Aponte talked to her about getting funding soon for new positions . When he said he wanted to take her to a bar , she \u201c felt she had no other choice but to go to the bar with [ REDACTED ] because [ REDACTED ] promotion was near and she desperately wanted the promotion. \u201d After they left the bar , the woman said Aponte drove to a dark area , parked , and kissed and groped her . She said she pushed him away . \u201c [ REDACTED ] stated that [ REDACTED ] started talking about the [ REDACTED ] promotions and at the end of the conversation [ LONGER REDACTED SECTION ] , \u201d the report stated . \u201c [ REDACTED ] stated that she felt if she did not [ REDACTED ] with [ REDACTED ] then she would not receive her promotion [ LONGER REDACTED SECTION ] . \u201d Aponte told the inspector general \u2019 s office that he didn \u2019 t interact with the woman at all that evening and also didn \u2019 t recall going out for drinks with her , taking her to a topless bar , or asking her about sexual positions . Eventually , she said , she felt pressured into having sex with Aponte in order to get the promotion , and described two incidents \u2014 once after he drove her home during a snowstorm , and once after they had gotten drinks and he parked on a dead-end street \u2014 in the period leading up to her being considered for the new job . She said Aponte helped her prepare for the interview , including giving her interview questions in advance , and that she ultimately received the promotion . Aponte denied having sex with her and denied helping her with the interview . He claimed he was being targeted because the woman \u2019 s request to work remotely had been denied . She reported to investigators that Aponte indicated he had personal information about her and where she lived , and she feared he was threatening her and might try to demand sex again in the future . Marilyn Moses , president of the Office of Justice Programs employees union , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the woman who reported being pressured into having sex with Aponte in exchange for a promotion received a monetary settlement from the department . Moses declined to specify the amount or share additional details . The woman and her lawyer declined an interview request . The fifth and final woman \u2019 s account was brief . Most of the details were redacted in the report , but it involved an elevator encounter that made the woman feel \u201c very uncomfortable. \u201d Aponte told investigators he didn \u2019 t remember the incident .\nThe inspector general \u2019 s office concluded that the women who reported Aponte were \u201c credible witnesses. \u201d The information they provided was \u201c detailed and specific , \u201d according to the report , and there wasn \u2019 t evidence that they \u2019 d consulted with each other before giving investigators accounts of similar bad behavior by Aponte .\nInvestigators found that Aponte , on the other hand , \u201c lacked credibility. \u201d \u201c He initially denied any relationship with [ REDACTED ] and [ REDACTED ] , but when confronted with evidence , admitted to having had sexual contact with both subordinates , \u201d the inspector general \u2019 s office said in its report . \u201c He also persistently minimized his misconduct and failed to demonstrate any recognition or appreciation for the seriousness of his actions as a senior manager. \u201d The report included information about S.C. \u2019 s efforts to report Aponte to management , but much of it is redacted . According to S.C. \u2019 s interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 and documents prepared by the employees union in 2013 , she first told a senior Office of Justice Programs official in 2012 that Aponte sexually harassed her . She said she was asked if she wanted to make a formal complaint , but declined because she didn \u2019 t want to hurt Aponte \u2019 s family or her own ; Moses said there was no requirement that employees make a formal complaint for management to take action . S.C. said she asked to be transferred to a different department so she wouldn \u2019 t have to see him , but management refused .\n`` I work at the Justice Department and I manage grants to prevent things like this . ''\n\u201c I just was like , so this is what happens ? I work at the Justice Department and I manage grants to prevent things like this , I go to shelters , I meet women that deal with these types of things , and I \u2019 m dealing with this and I work for the United States government and I \u2019 ve done nothing wrong ? \u201d S.C. said .\nS.C. told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that in addition to unwanted touching , Aponte engaged in other harassing behavior , including commenting on her clothes , taking her phone and going through text messages and photos \u2014 she said she started hiding her phone \u2014 and questioning why she was wearing makeup , and if it was because she was going on a date . She said they had been friends , so when he made the occasional inappropriate comment early on , she didn \u2019 t think there was a problem . \u201c I \u2019 m the type of person that when I get uncomfortable , I tend to laugh it off and ... I don \u2019 t like to make other people feel uncomfortable . And that is my biggest downfall , \u201d S.C. said . \u201c Even if he said , \u2018 Oh , you look good in those pants , \u2019 or whatever , I would be like , \u2018 Shut up , Ed , \u2019 and I would laugh it off , you know , and just walk out of his office. \u201d S.C. told the inspector general \u2019 s office and \u2588\u2588\u2588 that Aponte sexually assaulted her , but did not tell DOJ management . She declined to discuss the details of the assault with \u2588\u2588\u2588 , saying it was too painful , but did confirm that it happened after a sporting event . Other documents reviewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588 show that senior officials at DOJ were put on notice about S.C. \u2019 s harassment claims against Aponte over several years . In 2013 , when S.C. was facing disciplinary action for allegedly being absent from work without approval , the union sent a letter to management defending her and arguing she was facing retaliation for reporting Aponte the year before , as well as for using leave she was entitled to take under federal law . S.C. was fired in 2014 . In August 2015 , Moses sent a letter to Loretta Lynch , who had just become the US attorney general , alerting her that an employee had reported \u201c unwanted sexual advances \u201d by Aponte . The letter didn \u2019 t name S.C. , but the description of events matches the 2013 union letter . Moses told Lynch that management notified Aponte about the complaint and he denied it , and she questioned the lack of further investigation by officials . Both the 2015 letter to Lynch and the union \u2019 s 2013 letter defending S.C. against disciplinary action named Aponte . \u201c In a world where we assess the cost of everything , granting [ S.C. ] \u2019 s request for a transfer was a no cost solution that would have satisfied her . It would have also bought time for management to thoroughly investigate her claim and potentially prevent further harassment of others , \u201d Moses wrote in an email to \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c Ultimately management 's inaction over the years has exacted an enormous financial and emotional toll on his victims and all involved in this shameful situation . \u201d",
    "content_original": "Documents and interviews reveal new details about a pattern of sexual harassment by a senior Justice Department official, and what the department did \u2014 and did not do \u2014 in the year since he resigned.\n\nAdam Maida for BuzzFeed News\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 In December 2018, the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general dropped a bombshell: Investigators had \u201csubstantiated\u201d allegations that a senior DOJ official was a repeat sexual harasser. The official, who had retired by that point, harassed five women under his chain of command, the inspector general announced. One woman reported that she was not only harassed, but also sexually assaulted. Another woman reported that she was pressured into having sex to get a promotion. Few details were available at the time. The inspector general\u2019s summary of the investigation was barely two pages. The official had worked in the Office of Justice Programs, an arm of the Justice Department that partners with federal, state, and local law enforcement, but he wasn\u2019t identified. The summary didn\u2019t specify what the women accused him of doing or the time period. Because the official had left the department, there wouldn\u2019t be any internal disciplinary process. No criminal charges were filed. Nearly 10 months later, BuzzFeed News obtained a copy of the inspector general\u2019s full report. The 12-page document is redacted but includes a slew of new information, including detailed accounts from two of the women who described a pattern of escalating workplace harassment, as well as investigators\u2019 findings that the former official \u201clacked credibility\u201d and provided \u201cconflicting testimony.\u201d The former official\u2019s name is redacted in the inspector general\u2019s report, but BuzzFeed News previously identified him as Edison Aponte, who had worked at DOJ since 1994, according to a Justice Department spokesperson. Aponte\u2019s most recent title was associate deputy director in the Bureau of Justice Assistance, a section within the Office of Justice Programs that provides law enforcement training and grants \u2014 including, several sources noted, on issues related to victims of sexual assault and domestic violence.\n\n\u201cIt boggles the mind,\u201d said Jon Adler, who took over as the head of the Bureau of Justice Assistance in late 2017. By then, the inspector general\u2019s investigation was underway and Aponte had been placed on leave. A source with firsthand knowledge of the investigation originally confirmed Aponte\u2019s identity to BuzzFeed News in December. Reached by phone in December, Aponte said he could not confirm the inspector general\u2019s report was about him and hung up. Since then, four current and former Office of Justice Programs employees with firsthand knowledge of the investigation have confirmed that the official described in the inspector general\u2019s report is Aponte. BuzzFeed News also reviewed documents that refer to events described in the report that name him. Aponte did not respond to multiple attempts to reach him for comment in the past month. One woman told the inspector general\u2019s office that Aponte\u2019s behavior began with inappropriate comments and unwanted touching \u2014 she said she put a mirror in her cubicle because he would come up behind her and rub her shoulders \u2014 and said he eventually raped her. Aponte denied the assault, but told investigators they had sex.\n\nAnother woman told investigators that it started with suggestive comments over drinks. Aponte once took her to a topless bar and asked her what sexual positions she liked, she said. She later felt pressured into a sexual relationship to secure a promotion; he knew she was struggling financially, she said. Aponte denied that relationship.

Two other women reported \u201cuncomfortable\u201d encounters with him. One of the women who reported being harassed \u2014 the one who said he pressured her to have sex in order to get a promotion \u2014 received a financial settlement from the Justice Department, a source with firsthand knowledge of the agreement told BuzzFeed News. The woman and her lawyer declined an interview request.\n\n\"They didn\u2019t do anything when I went to them. ... They protected him and they allowed it.\"\n\nThe woman who reported that Aponte sexually harassed and raped her agreed to speak with BuzzFeed News on the condition that she only be identified by her initials, S.C. She said she felt ignored and abandoned by department officials after she first reported being harassed by him in 2012. She\u2019s still angry about how the department handled her situation, and said the fact that Aponte is gone and the inspector general made a public finding of wrongdoing wasn\u2019t a satisfying resolution.\n\n\u201cWhat he did to those other people, management allowed to have happened \u2014 because they didn\u2019t do anything when I went to them. They allowed that. They protected him and they allowed it,\u201d she said. The report doesn\u2019t say what happened in the year after the investigation ended, but BuzzFeed News reviewed documents and interviewed sources inside the department that fill in the timeline. A senior human resources manager told the employees union in January that new \u201cmandatory\u201d sexual harassment training for all Office of Justice Programs employees would begin in the spring and that management would consult with the union on a new sexual harassment policy. However, three sources \u2014 a union official, a former senior official at OJP, and a current employee \u2014 told BuzzFeed News that none of that has happened to date. A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment. Sexual harassment hasn\u2019t just been a problem in one office at the Justice Department. In May 2017, the inspector general\u2019s office alerted then\u2013deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein to \u201cpotential systemic issues\u201d across DOJ. From 2012 to 2016, for instance, the inspector general released summaries of 19 substantiated complaints that included sexual misconduct and either involved high-level DOJ officials or were otherwise of \u201csignificant public interest.\u201d Those and other internal investigations highlighted problems with how sexual harassment was being tracked and punished, the inspector general told Rosenstein. A year later, Rosenstein issued a memo directing every office to follow new guidelines for how to address sexual harassment. The memo outlined \u201cguiding principles\u201d for harassment policies and how to punish misconduct. All offices were given 90 days to come up with a system to track complaints. In a June letter to the US Commission on Civil Rights, which has been reviewing sexual harassment in the federal government, the Justice Department\u2019s Gender Equality Network (DOJ GEN), an employee group, said it was \u201cencouraged\u201d by Rosenstein\u2019s memo, but it wasn\u2019t enough. \u201cDOJ GEN believes DOJ must do more to strengthen its sexual harassment and misconduct policies and to ensure that DOJ employees who experience sexual harassment or misconduct are not dismissed and ignored,\u201d the group wrote. Representatives of DOJ GEN declined to comment.\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s office began its investigation into Aponte after receiving information in March 2017 from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees 2830, the union that represents Office of Justice Programs employees. Aponte was placed on administrative leave at that time, according to a department spokesperson.

The report is divided into sections detailing each woman\u2019s account. The first woman provided a letter to investigators describing a sexual relationship with Aponte and indicated that he was her supervisor throughout that relationship. Aponte initially told the inspector general\u2019s office he didn\u2019t have a sexual relationship with the woman, but when confronted with information from her letter, he admitted it. \u201c[REDACTED] admitted to the OIG that he exercised bad judgment, especially in view of his position as an [REDACTED],\u201d according to the report, an apparent reference to Aponte\u2019s position as a senior manager. \u201c[REDACTED] admitted that he should not have been involved with his female subordinates in any way that would appear that he was violating ethical rules.

He denied assaulting her. The report noted that no criminal charges were filed against Aponte. S.C. told BuzzFeed News that she decided not to go to the police because she didn\u2019t want to bring attention to herself or her family.

She said she pushed him away. \u201c[REDACTED] stated that [REDACTED] started talking about the [REDACTED] promotions and at the end of the conversation [LONGER REDACTED SECTION],\u201d the report stated. \u201c[REDACTED] stated that she felt if she did not [REDACTED] with [REDACTED] then she would not receive her promotion [LONGER REDACTED SECTION].\u201d Aponte told the inspector general\u2019s office that he didn\u2019t interact with the woman at all that evening and also didn\u2019t recall going out for drinks with her, taking her to a topless bar, or asking her about sexual positions. Eventually, she said, she felt pressured into having sex with Aponte in order to get the promotion, and described two incidents \u2014 once after he drove her home during a snowstorm, and once after they had gotten drinks and he parked on a dead-end street \u2014 in the period leading up to her being considered for the new job. She said Aponte helped her prepare for the interview, including giving her interview questions in advance, and that she ultimately received the promotion. Aponte denied having sex with her and denied helping her with the interview. He claimed he was being targeted because the woman\u2019s request to work remotely had been denied. She reported to investigators that Aponte indicated he had personal information about her and where she lived, and she feared he was threatening her and might try to demand sex again in the future. Marilyn Moses, president of the Office of Justice Programs employees union, told BuzzFeed News that the woman who reported being pressured into having sex with Aponte in exchange for a promotion received a monetary settlement from the department. Moses declined to specify the amount or share additional details. The woman and her lawyer declined an interview request. The fifth and final woman\u2019s account was brief. Most of the details were redacted in the report, but it involved an elevator encounter that made the woman feel \u201cvery uncomfortable.\u201d Aponte told investigators he didn\u2019t remember the incident.\n\nThe inspector general\u2019s office concluded that the women who reported Aponte were \u201ccredible witnesses.\u201d The information they provided was \u201cdetailed and specific,\u201d according to the report, and there wasn\u2019t evidence that they\u2019d consulted with each other before giving investigators accounts of similar bad behavior by Aponte.\n\nInvestigators found that Aponte, on the other hand, \u201clacked credibility.\u201d \u201cHe initially denied any relationship with [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], but when confronted with evidence, admitted to having had sexual contact with both subordinates,\u201d the inspector general\u2019s office said in its report. \u201cHe also persistently minimized his misconduct and failed to demonstrate any recognition or appreciation for the seriousness of his actions as a senior manager.\u201d The report included information about S.C.\u2019s efforts to report Aponte to management, but much of it is redacted. According to S.C.\u2019s interview with BuzzFeed News and documents prepared by the employees union in 2013, she first told a senior Office of Justice Programs official in 2012 that Aponte sexually harassed her. She said she was asked if she wanted to make a formal complaint, but declined because she didn\u2019t want to hurt Aponte\u2019s family or her own; Moses said there was no requirement that employees make a formal complaint for management to take action. S.C. said she asked to be transferred to a different department so she wouldn\u2019t have to see him, but management refused.\n\n\"I work at the Justice Department and I manage grants to prevent things like this.\"\n\n\u201cI just was like, so this is what happens? I work at the Justice Department and I manage grants to prevent things like this, I go to shelters, I meet women that deal with these types of things, and I\u2019m dealing with this and I work for the United States government and I\u2019ve done nothing wrong?\u201d S.C. said.\n\nS.C. told BuzzFeed News that in addition to unwanted touching, Aponte engaged in other harassing behavior, including commenting on her clothes, taking her phone and going through text messages and photos \u2014 she said she started hiding her phone \u2014 and questioning why she was wearing makeup, and if it was because she was going on a date. She said they had been friends, so when he made the occasional inappropriate comment early on, she didn\u2019t think there was a problem. \u201cI\u2019m the type of person that when I get uncomfortable, I tend to laugh it off and ... I don\u2019t like to make other people feel uncomfortable. And that is my biggest downfall,\u201d S.C. said. \u201cEven if he said, \u2018Oh, you look good in those pants,\u2019 or whatever, I would be like, \u2018Shut up, Ed,\u2019 and I would laugh it off, you know, and just walk out of his office.\u201d S.C. told the inspector general\u2019s office and BuzzFeed News that Aponte sexually assaulted her, but did not tell DOJ management. She declined to discuss the details of the assault with BuzzFeed News, saying it was too painful, but did confirm that it happened after a sporting event. Other documents reviewed by BuzzFeed News show that senior officials at DOJ were put on notice about S.C.\u2019s harassment claims against Aponte over several years. In 2013, when S.C. was facing disciplinary action for allegedly being absent from work without approval, the union sent a letter to management defending her and arguing she was facing retaliation for reporting Aponte the year before, as well as for using leave she was entitled to take under federal law. S.C. was fired in 2014. In August 2015, Moses sent a letter to Loretta Lynch, who had just become the US attorney general, alerting her that an employee had reported \u201cunwanted sexual advances\u201d by Aponte. The letter didn\u2019t name S.C., but the description of events matches the 2013 union letter. Moses told Lynch that management notified Aponte about the complaint and he denied it, and she questioned the lack of further investigation by officials. Both the 2015 letter to Lynch and the union\u2019s 2013 letter defending S.C. against disciplinary action named Aponte. \u201cIn a world where we assess the cost of everything, granting [S.C.]\u2019s request for a transfer was a no cost solution that would have satisfied her. It would have also bought time for management to thoroughly investigate her claim and potentially prevent further harassment of others,\u201d Moses wrote in an email to BuzzFeed News. \u201cUltimately management's inaction over the years has exacted an enormous financial and emotional toll on his victims and all involved in this shameful situation.\u201d\n\nGraham Klotz / Getty Images The Department of Justice in Washington, DC.",
