    "content": "In his 2003 presidential address to the American Economics Association , Robert Lucas , a distinguished practitioner of the field and a Nobel laureate , proclaimed that \u201c macroeconomics was born as a distinct field in the 1940s , as part of the intellectual response to the Great Depression , \u201d and that he was able to say confidently \u201c that macroeconomics in this original sense has succeeded : Its central problem of depression prevention has been solved , for all practical purposes , and has in fact been solved for many decades . \u201d\nJust four years later , in 2007 , the United States began to tip into recession . About a year after that , the recession triggered a financial crisis that led to a much more rapid collapse of demand \u2014 setting off a period that we don \u2019 t formally refer to as a \u201c depression \u201d but that certainly had most of the relevant characteristics of one . And that Great Recession became , though not strictly universal , certainly a global phenomenon , striking Britain , Japan , and the European Union , with spillover effects to South Africa , most of Latin America , and beyond .\nAnd though 10 years later the American labor market has largely recovered , the same can not be said for Europe . What \u2019 s more , the output lost during the crisis is in a sense never coming back \u2014 trillions in human wealth are simply gone forever . The United States alone lost somewhere on the order of $ 5 trillion to $ 10 trillion worth of economic output , with much more damage accruing abroad .\nEven worse , the world continues to struggle with the political consequences of the crisis . Around the world , progress toward freer trade and more economic integration has halted , anti-immigration parties are on the rise , and the prestige of liberal democracy has eroded around the world .\nThe field of policy that Lucas derided as a solved problem is known technically as \u201c macroeconomic stabilization. \u201d It \u2019 s mainly done by central banks like the US Federal Reserve , the European Central Bank , and the Bank of Japan , which routinely manipulate short-term interest rates . When pressed by the severity of the 2008 crisis , they tried more exotic methods like quantitative easing \u2014 basically bulk purchases of long-term government bonds \u2014 as well . But it goes beyond the central banks . National legislatures also play a role in fighting downturns by enacting ( or not ) fiscal stimulus programs .\nThere \u2019 s nothing inevitable about how things played out in 2008 . Australia hasn \u2019 t had a recession in 30 years , and in theory , equally skillful governments of bigger countries could produce the same result . The goal of macroeconomic stabilization is to make sure that recessions are rare , shallow , and short . And 15 years ago , policymakers were convinced that they had it all figured out .\nThe Great Recession made it clear that they had not . The uncontroversial tool of short-term interest rates wasn \u2019 t powerful enough , and the other options are the subject of both academic and political disagreement . Meanwhile , with the crisis in the rearview mirror , politicians have moved on to discussing other things . But though policymakers in Japan appear to have finally hit on a formula that works to stimulate a deeply depressed economy \u2014 a mixture of large budget deficits , direct central bank setting of long-term as well as short-term interest rates , and even printing money to buy shares of stock \u2014 these ideas remain controversial , untested , and in some cases illegal in the West .\nDepressions , however , are extraordinarily damaging . And though the most recent global downturn largely spared the world \u2019 s poorest people , that was much more a matter of good luck than policy design . Crafting a science and technology of macroeconomic stabilization that can reliably prevent depressions could alleviate the suffering of millions , while simultaneously minimizing the odds of political catastrophes unleashed by economic mismanagement .\nThe Congressional Budget Office routinely publishes estimates of the \u201c potential output \u201d of the United States \u2014 how much goods and services could be produced if the available stock of human labor and capital goods were fully utilized , as they would be in a system of perfect macroeconomic stabilization . If actual output exceeds potential output by too much , inflation will result . When it falls short , we have elevated unemployment and sluggish wage growth .\nA chart that simply subtracts actual GDP from potential GDP reveals the striking fact that since the dot-com crash of 2000 , America has had below-potential output every single year of the 21st century .\nThis has given us , in the aggregate , $ 5.5 trillion less of total goods and services than we would have had in a properly stabilized economy .\nBut even that is a significant underestimate of the aggregate cost of poor macroeconomic management to the country . That \u2019 s because potential output is in part a function of past actual output . When the stock of capital goods \u2014 that \u2019 s buildings , machines , and business equipment \u2014 is fully employed , then there are strong incentives to invest in making new capital goods that raise potential output in the future . Similarly , when people are working rather than unemployed , they are building on-the-job skills that make them more valuable workers in the future .\nIn 2017 and 2018 , we are only falling slightly below our economy \u2019 s ability to produce things . But that closing of the gap largely reflects a steady shrinking of our expected capacity \u2014 in other words , we \u2019 re likely underestimating just how much economic damage we \u2019 ve suffered because our forecasts for expected output have fallen steadily over time .\nThis means the real cost of poor macroeconomic management in the 21st century could easily be twice as high as my numbers . But worse , if you take the implications of falling potential output fully seriously , the implication is that we will forever be at least somewhat poorer than we otherwise could have been . And of course , those are only the costs to the United States of America . The impact in the eurozone \u2014 whose total output is somewhat larger than America \u2019 s \u2014 has been , if anything , more severe .\nAnd in some respects , the next recession could be even worse .\nThough the Great Recession ravaged hundreds of millions of people around the world , it didn \u2019 t impede global progress toward reductions in steep absolute poverty . This was good news , but it led , in some ways , to an unfortunate tendency in humanitarian circles to characterize the economic calamity as a kind of distraction from the real good news about the global economy . The truth is that the global poor got lucky and , unless the world \u2019 s understanding of macroeconomic stabilization improves , they may not be so lucky next time .\nThe two most important pieces of good luck are that China and India entered the recession with the ability to fight the downturn via massive fiscal stimulus ( in China \u2019 s case ) and conventional interest rate cuts ( for India ) , which not only had a large direct impact on poverty but also managed to sustain growth in most of sub-Saharan Africa , which was exporting a lot to China .\nBut not all developing countries were so lucky . Places like South Africa and much of Latin America and the Caribbean were more economically linked to the US and Europe than to China and suffered massively . And Africa \u2019 s strong performance despite a global recession was exceptional by historical standards . Prior to the 2008- \u2019 09 business cycle , relatively mild recessions in the rich world ( the recessions so mild that they prompted Lucas to proclaim the whole problem irrelevant ) had more severe impacts on Africa \u2019 s commodity-oriented economies than they did on the countries that originally set them off .\nOf course , if China and India somehow never have a recession again , then perhaps global poverty can continue falling indefinitely no matter how poorly the US and European economies are managed . But the risk is that as China and India continue to converge economically with the developed world , they will increasingly face the exact same policy challenges as the developed world \u2014 meaning the question of effective macroeconomic stabilization should be seen as a fundamentally global problem .\nDeep recessions , meanwhile , also have the unfortunate consequence of pushing rich countries \u2019 economic policy in directions that are harmful to the world \u2019 s most vulnerable people .\nThe core problem of the knock-on political consequences of bad macroeconomic policy is that during a recession , the objective facts of economic policy change . When the labor market is healthy , then policies that boost productivity and growth make the vast majority of people better off even if they do displace some workers . People who lose jobs just find new ones .\nWhen the labor market is unhealthy , people tend to feel differently about politics and policy . But those feelings are rooted in objective reality . It \u2019 s genuinely true that technological advancement , openness to trade , immigration , and other growth-promoting policies can be damaging to many people .\nConsider trade . Paul Krugman spent much of the downturn years arguing that restricting trade with China would help boost the American economy , given the high unemployment rate . Gauti Eggertsson of Brown University and the New York Fed has a fairly convincing paper arguing that during the New Deal , policies to form cartels and reduce agricultural output actually improved economic growth because higher prices broke the cycle of deflation . Similarly , but going in the other direction , low unemployment and labor scarcity create a strong constituency for openness to immigrant workers who become objectively necessary for growth when there \u2019 s no reserve army of domestic unemployed .\nJapan , for example , is becoming increasingly welcoming toward immigrants even as the rest of the world is moving in the opposite direction precisely because Japan has gotten ahead of other rich countries in its macroeconomic management . Japan \u2019 s labor force participation rate is at an all-time high , which is great news for Japanese people but also makes more immigration objectively desirable , which is in turn creating enormous new opportunities for residents of poorer countries . If every rich country could get as good at recession-fighting as Japan , the entire global political climate would be much more benign .\nThe core problem of the Great Recession , looking back , is precisely that Lucas \u2019 s complacent forecast really did seem sensible at the time . It appeared for a span of decades that central banks had learned how to successfully manipulate short-term interest rates in a predictable and reliable way that , while not avoiding recessions altogether , made them relatively short and painless .\nThat era came to a crashing halt in 2007- \u2019 08 . Interest rates were already low by the time the downturn struck , so further cuts in short-term rates \u2014 the Fed \u2019 s traditional main tool \u2014 was not much help . The Federal Reserve cut them all the way down to zero , but that wasn \u2019 t low enough . And neither the Fed nor other major central banks had a clear game plan for what to do once you get to zero .\nWhen we needed a robust response to the Great Recession , we were ill-equipped both as a matter of politics and policy . Congress tried fiscal stimulus and the Fed tried several rounds of quantitative easing , and the best evidence suggests that they both helped . But neither was enacted on a scale sufficient to actually cure the problem , and both were the subject of massive political backlash .\nAt the moment , Fed policymakers and professional staff have a somewhat clearer view of the technical issues than they did pre-recession , but they still have no specific game plan for what to do next time , and there \u2019 s zero political consensus about what they should do .\nOver the past decades , a range of countries have experimented with some different approaches that seem to work \u2014 massive quantitative easing in Japan , exchange rate manipulation in Switzerland , credit policy in China \u2014 but none of them are clearly understood or universally accepted . Most importantly , the biggest and most influential central banks in the world \u2014 the Fed and the European Central Bank \u2014 haven \u2019 t clearly embraced any of these solutions as its game plan for the next time around . Nor have the American or European political systems reached any kind of consensus on the use of discretionary fiscal policy as an alternative to relying on central banks .\nAn underrated option that probably deserves more consideration is to dispense with a lot of the complexity and simply have the central bank print money and give directly to citizens as a kind of combined fiscal/monetary stimulus . There is , however , a wide variety of possible solutions , and it \u2019 s not particularly important which one is picked as long as something is picked .\nBut instead , everyone is left standing around essentially hoping that the problems that afflicted us a decade ago won \u2019 t arise again , even though almost nothing has been done to try to prevent their recurrence . Whether or not that changes in time is one of the biggest issues facing the future of humanity and deserves to be taken more seriously .",
