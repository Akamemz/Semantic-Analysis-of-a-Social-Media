It did seem to find a reasonable basis , \u201d she said in answer to pointed questions from Sen. Ted Cruz ( R ) of Texas .\nMany Republican senators maintain that Obama exceeded his authority under the Constitution and usurped legislative power reserved exclusively for Congress . The issue is being litigated in a federal court in Texas .\nDemocrats disagree with this view and tried to play down attempts by Republicans to pin Ms. Lynch down on the issue .\n\u201c I have to have a clear answer to this question , \u201d Sen. Jeff Sessions ( R ) of Alabama asked . \u201c Do you believe the executive action announced by President Obama is legal and constitutional ? \u201d\nLynch responded : \u201c As I read the opinion , I believe it is . \u201d\nThe legal memo , Lynch added , had also recommended that the president not take certain contemplated actions . She said the administration followed that advice as well .\nThe comments came during a day-long hearing in which she nimbly fielded barbed questions mostly from Republican senators still smarting over their contentious confrontations with outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder .\nLynch sought to reassure combative Republicans that she would not be a clone of her predecessor . Mr. Holder maintained a prickly posture toward Republicans in Congress and became the first attorney general in US history to be held in contempt of Congress for failing to cooperate on oversight issues .\n\u201c How do we know you are not going to perform your duties as attorney general the way Eric Holder performed his duties ? \u201d Sen. John Cornyn ( R ) of Texas asked .\n\u201c I will be myself , \u201d Lynch said . \u201c I will be Loretta Lynch . \u201d\nShe added : \u201c I do pledge to this committee that I want to hear your concerns . I want to listen to your concerns and will discuss them going forward . \u201d\nThe confirmation hearing seemed at times more like a forum for Republican complaints about the Obama administration than an examination of Lynch \u2019 s qualifications to become America \u2019 s top federal law enforcement official .\nThrough it all , Lynch maintained a professional and businesslike demeanor that she probably honed while prosecuting terrorists , mob figures , corrupt cops , and white-collar criminals in the Eastern District of New York .\nIf confirmed for the job , as expected , she will become the first African-American woman to serve as attorney general .\nIf the Republicans were particularly tough on her , the Democrats were more than supportive .\n\u201c She is smart , she is tough , she is hard-working and independent . Her qualifications are beyond reproach , \u201d Sen. Patrick Leahy ( D ) of Vermont said .\nSen.
