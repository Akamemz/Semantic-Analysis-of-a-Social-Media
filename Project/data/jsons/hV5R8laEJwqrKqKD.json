The Obama campaign released the transcript after the editor complained the president 's team had `` handcuffed '' the newspaper by insisting it be kept off record .\nIn the interview , Obama made two pledges for a second term , saying he 's confident Washington can strike a `` grand bargain '' deal on deficit reduction and immigration reform next year . He went on to take a swing at Republicans on the latter issue .\n`` And since this is off the record , I will just be very blunt . Should I win a second term , a big reason I will win a second term is because the Republican nominee and the Republican Party have so alienated the fastest-growing demographic group in the country , the Latino community . And this is a relatively new phenomenon , '' Obama said , likely in reference to the wave of illegal immigration enforcement laws at the state level .\nThe Romney campaign , in response , cast doubt on the president 's editorial board comments , pointing to Obama 's failure so far to pass comprehensive immigration reform despite pledges in 2008 to do so .\n`` It 's a fascinating glimpse into how President Obama has taken the Hispanic community for granted for the past four years , '' spokesman Alberto Martinez said in a statement .\n`` He 's caught making secret promises to an editorial board in Iowa , which also happens to be a promise he made in 2008 , a promise he failed to keep , and a promise he does n't repeat publicly .
