There , the elections supervisor had implemented ballots that spread across two pages of the Votamatic punch card . Voters could n't tell where , exactly , they needed to punch . And in counties around the state , election officials were forced to distinguish among hanging , dimpled , dangling and even swinging chads ( the bits left over after the hole punch ) to determine valid votes . The debacle prodded election officials in several states and counties to move as far away from paper as possible .\nSince then , officials have largely discovered that paper still plays a crucial role : creating an audit trail that verifies votes have n't been altered by hackers or computer glitches .

Machines now in use in the five paperless states were all purchased at that time .\n`` Electronic voting machines did eliminate the issue of determining voter intent , '' said Chris Whitmire , a spokesman for the South Carolina State Election Commission . `` It wo n't let a voter overvote .
