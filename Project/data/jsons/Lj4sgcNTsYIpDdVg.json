( Stephanie Keith/Reuters )\nMaintaining an even temperament and avoiding overstatement and invective can improve our political discourse .\nAmerica \u2019 s two great ideological tribes are in the midst of a similar conflict . It \u2019 s the battle over civility , and all too often reason , compassion , and grace are on the losing side . On the left , aggressive social-justice activists scorn engagement and dialogue as \u201c respectability politics \u201d and instead favor the shout-down , the boycott , and the online shame campaign .\nOn the right , online pugilists mock more mainstream or \u201c establishment \u201d conservatives as unwilling to do what it takes to win . They mock conservatives who refuse to make Trump-style attacks and decry Trump-style rhetoric as obsessed with \u201c muh principles. \u201d In the face of a ferocious Left , we just don \u2019 t have what it takes \u2014 or , as Milo Yiannopoulos said earlier this week in a long piece calling me \u201c the most reliably frustrating person in conservative media , \u201d we \u2019 re more prepared to \u201c lose gracefully \u201d than to \u201c be seen as lacking in manners . \u201d\nFirst , let \u2019 s acknowledge that there \u2019 s more than a kernel of truth in these critiques . Civility isn \u2019 t always a virtue . There are times when injustice demands a dramatic response . The modern image of Jesus Christ as essentially the nicest person who ever lived is laughably one-dimensional . He compared the Pharisees to \u201c whitewashed tombs. \u201d Jesus cleansed the Temple \u201c with a whip made out of cords. \u201d He modeled grace and compassion . He also modeled righteous anger .\nMoreover , it \u2019 s also true that calls for civility are often one-sided , manipulative , and made in bad faith . It turns out that each ideological tribe is often quite tolerant of the vicious voices on its own side and positively repulsed by anger in response . You see the double standard all the time . The same people who lament the angry voices on Fox News or talk radio will positively thrill to the latest Michael Moore documentary or make excuses for Democratic leaders who just can \u2019 t quite bring themselves to condemn Louis Farrakhan .\nThe same people who lament the angry voices on Fox News or talk radio will positively thrill to the latest Michael Moore documentary or make excuses for Democratic leaders who just can \u2019 t quite bring themselves to condemn Louis Farrakhan .\nIn fact , calls for civility are so frequently made in bad faith that it \u2019 s easy to get cynical . There \u2019 s perhaps no better example of public manipulation and bad faith than the cry from the left for civility after a deranged , evil young man killed six people in Tucson , Ariz. , and severely injured Gabrielle Giffords .

If you would rather be seen as well-mannered than fight for your fundamental values , then you need to rethink your priorities .\nI can promise you this : If you \u2019 re a social conservative , and you insist on believing that marriage is the union of a man and a woman , that sex is defined biologically and not psychologically , and understand that no person has a \u201c right \u201d to kill a child in the womb , then you \u2019 ll be called \u201c hateful \u201d and \u201c bigoted \u201d no matter how winsome , kind , or civil you try to be . While the church obviously struggles with imperfect and flawed messengers ( and always will ) , the message itself divides and inflames .\nOur true moral obligations are complicated . They \u2019 re simultaneously dependent on and independent of our listener \u2019 s response . You have an obligation to speak the truth even when the truth hurts . Harming your opponent , however , isn \u2019 t your goal . You \u2019 re seeking to persuade , yet you know the very act of attempting to persuade can also enrage . Yes , you should love your enemies , but you also have to understand they \u2019 re still your enemies .\nIt \u2019 s been almost 30 years since I left college , and I \u2019 m still working through these challenges . I \u2019 m still trying to discern the best way to participate in the public debate .

I \u2019 m keenly aware that even when I can know the truth , I don \u2019 t always know the best way to communicate that truth .\nThus it \u2019 s imperative to read the best expression of the opposing side \u2019 s point of view . Reading only the worst ( as entertaining as that can be ) is inherently deceptive . It can wrongly confirm your own self-righteousness and wrongly demonize your opponent .
