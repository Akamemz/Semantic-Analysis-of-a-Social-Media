    "content": "The chairman of a special House committee created to investigate the 2012 Benghazi tragedy on Monday instructed his staff to review secretly recorded tapes and intelligence reports that detail Hillary Rodham Clinton \u2019 s role in advocating and executing the war in Libya , opening the door for a possible expansion of his probe .\nRep. Trey Gowdy \u2019 s decision to seek a review of the materials , first highlighted in a series of \u2588\u2588\u2588 stories last week , carries consequences for the 2016 election in which Mrs. Clinton is expected to seek the presidency . It could also move the committee to examine the strained relationship between the State Department and Pentagon , which sharply disagreed over the 2011 war in Libya and the response to the terrorist attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi a year later .\nThe Times reported last week that U.S. intelligence did not support Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s story of an impending genocide in Libya that she used to sell the war against Moammar Gadhafi \u2019 s regime . The newspaper also unveiled secretly recorded tapes from Libya that showed that the Pentagon and Democratic Congressman Dennis Kucinich so distrusted her stewardship of the war that they opened their own diplomatic channels with the Gadhafi regime .\nThe tapes included candid conversations and allegations that Mrs. Clinton took the U.S. to war on false pretenses and was not listening to the advice of military commanders or career intelligence officers .\n\u201c Chairman Gowdy and the committee are aware of the details reported by The \u2588\u2588\u2588 , and we are reviewing them as part of the committee \u2019 s inquiry into Benghazi , \u201d Benghazi Committee spokesman Jamal Ware announced Monday .\nThe emergence of the tapes and a new line of inquiry immediately had repercussions , especially on the political front where the 2016 president race has heated up .\nSen. Rand Paul of Kentucky , a 2016 GOP hopeful who has been intensely critical of Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s handling of the 2011 Libya intervention , said the stories demonstrate she is not the right person to lead the country or the nation \u2019 s military .\n\u201c Hillary \u2019 s judgment has to be questioned \u2013 her eagerness for war in Libya should preclude her from being considered the next Commander in Chief , \u201d said Sen. Paul , who opposed the Libyan intervention at the onset .\n\u201c We want someone in that office with wisdom and better judgment\u2026 We created chaos in Libya \u2013 as a result many arms have gone to Syria which are now aiding jihadi terrorists . I couldn \u2019 t fathom how Hillary Clinton could become Commander and Chief after this , \u201d he added .\nMrs. Clinton \u2019 s spokesman have declined any comment about the tapes .\nThe Times reported that on one of the tapes , a Pentagon liaison told a Gadhafi aide that Army Gen. Charles Jacoby , a top aide to Adm. Mullen , \u201c does not trust the reports that are coming out of the State Department and CIA , but there \u2019 s nothing he can do about it , \u201d the Pentagon liaison said , offering a candid assessment of tensions within the Obama administration .\n\u201c I can tell you that the President is not getting accurate information so at some point someone has to get accurate information to him\u2026 I think about a way through former Secretary Gates or maybe to Admiral Mullen to get him information . \u201d\nRep.

That was was a false narrative . So , it would make sense that they would want to get that information straight to the president and not go through the Secretary of State , \u201d he added\nIn reaction to the Times final installment of the series on Monday , which revealed secret Libyan intelligence reports that linked NATO supported rebels to al-Qaeda , Rep.
