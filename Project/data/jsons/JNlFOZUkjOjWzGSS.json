Biden \u2019 s two debate outings this summer suggest that a politician who has been at this game for decades operates within a predictable and fairly narrow range \u2014 at his best , not half-bad ; at his worst , pretty bad for a supposed front-runner .\nThough he was closer to the upper range this time \u2014 except for a funny fumbled line at the end when he tried to tell people to support his campaign with a text message \u2014 it still seems inconceivable that many undecided voters will move to Biden because they think he is a reliably good debater . It seems conceivable that people already leaning toward him will stay that way because they think he is good enough .\nIn that case , however , the main assumption around these early debates \u2014 that the theatrics really matter , that democracy may hinge on assorted viral zingers and splats \u2014 would be called into question .\nEvery candidate other than Biden has a powerful incentive to prove that the debates do matter , and no candidate has a better claim on that case than Sen.
