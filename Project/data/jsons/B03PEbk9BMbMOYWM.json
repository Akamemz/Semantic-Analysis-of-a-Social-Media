''\n`` Both public safety and public trust are crucial to the law enforcement mission , '' the White House said in a tweet Monday night . `` Tomorrow \u2019 s Executive Order will uphold clear and high policing standards , promote accountability in law enforcement , and help equip police officers for constructive community engagement .
