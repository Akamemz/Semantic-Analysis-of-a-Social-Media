    "content": "Louisiana could become the first state not to have legal abortion access since the procedure was legalized in 1973 . Depending on the outcome of an upcoming Supreme Court case next spring , the state could see abortion access effectively eliminated , even though Roe v. Wade \u2014 the case that legalized the procedure \u2014 would stay intact .\nLouisiana 's `` Unsafe Abortion Protection Act '' is at the heart of the Supreme Court case . The law , not currently in effect , would require doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital . Supporters of the law say the regulation would assist with `` continuity of care '' in the event of an emergency .\nOnly two abortion doctors in the state have been successful in gaining the special designation , despite multiple attempts , according to clinic administrators and court documents . Earlier this month , when the Supreme Court announced it would take up the case , it was believed that the two doctors would become the state 's only legal providers and Louisiana would be down to one clinic .\nHowever , \u2588\u2588\u2588 has learned that one of the two doctors with admitting privileges , who goes by Dr. John Doe 5 in court documents , stopped providing abortions about a year ago , according to sources familiar with the matter . The other , who goes by John Doe 3 , has said he would retire if the Supreme Court holds up the law , making him what he has described as the `` last man standing . ''\nThat retirement would close Hope Medical Group for Women in Shreveport , effectively ending legal abortion in Louisiana . The result would be what many pro-abortion rights advocates have long feared \u2014 that even without overturning Roe v Wade , abortion could be regulated out of existence .\n`` It would be devastating for all of us , '' Kathaleen Pittman , an administrator at Hope , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 on Wednesday . `` And not just the staff but for the women that we generally serve , not just in North Louisiana but South Louisiana , East Texas , Arkansas , Mississippi . We have patients coming to us from Oklahoma . It would be devastating for all of them . ''\nPittman sat down with \u2588\u2588\u2588 inside the facility to speak this week about her clinic 's experience providing abortions .\nIn court documents , Dr. John Doe 3 said becoming the last abortion provider in Louisiana `` would make me a target for those who are radicals who are opposed to abortion . All they have to do is eliminate me as they have Dr. Tiller and some other abortion providers around the country , just , you know , assassinate me and that 's all they have to do . ''\nDr. John Doe 3 testified in the case under a pseudonym because he was `` fearful for [ his ] safety , '' according to court documents , and declined to be interviewed by \u2588\u2588\u2588 for the same reason . Dr. John Doe 5 did not return an email and call requesting comment .\nIn an interview with \u2588\u2588\u2588 , the author of the law , Representative Katrina Jackson , denied the requirement was intended to shut down abortion access and called the regulation `` common-sense women 's health care . ''\nBut providers in the state \u2014 and medical groups like the American Medical Association and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology \u2014 disagree .\n`` He 's been targeted at home and his primary office , '' Pittman said . `` There 's been veiled threats there , there 's constant online harassment through social media . If all the other clinics were to close , it would be more than anybody could ask of him to continue the work . ''\nJackson said she was skeptical of Dr. John Doe 3 's retirement plans , suggesting his claim was `` a great way to up the ante . ''\n`` I think it 's a part of their case , '' she said .\nPro-abortion rights activists are concerned that if Louisiana law is allowed to go into effect , it would provide a road map for other states interested in eliminating abortion without overturning Roe v. Wade .\n`` If the supreme court does not strike down this bogus Louisiana law , you are going to see anti- [ abortion ] activists double down , triple down on these types of restrictions , '' TJ Tu , the lead counsel arguing against the law for the Center for Reproductive Rights , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 in an interview earlier this month . `` And it wo n't just be admitting privileges laws . It 'll be any number of sham restrictions that are nominally about women 's health , but of course , are really just designed to shut down clinics . ''\nA spokesperson for the state 's other two abortion providers \u2014 the Delta Clinic in Baton Rouge and Women 's Health Care Clinic in New Orleans \u2014 says `` contingency plans are being discussed , '' but as it stands , they would not be able to continue providing abortions if the Supreme Court were to uphold the admitting privilege law .\nMeanwhile , a Planned Parenthood in New Orleans is also in court , fighting for a license to become an abortion provider .
