Pointedly , the president vowed not to openly discuss troop numbers , withdrawal dates , or attack plans .\n\u201c Conditions on the ground , not arbitrary timetables , will guide our strategy from now on , \u201d he said , vowing , \u201c America \u2019 s enemies will never know our plans . ''\nAhead of the speech , a senior U.S. official confirmed to Fox News that Trump has in fact signed off on sending an additional 4,000 troops to Afghanistan , apparently listening to appeals from his generals . But Trump \u2019 s address to the nation was focused on more than troop levels .\nHe stressed that the U.S. commitment to Afghanistan is not a \u201c blank check \u201d and the American people expect \u201c real results. \u201d He declared the days of democracy-building abroad are \u201c over . \u201d\n\u201c We are not nation-building again , \u201d Trump said . \u201c We are killing terrorists . \u201d\nTrump is now the third commander-in-chief to attempt to bring stability to the war-torn country and seek a U.S. victory in what is now America \u2019 s longest war . He acknowledged the American people are \u201c weary of war without victory . \u201d\nBut he sought to bring new focus to the fight Monday night , highlighting the threat that must be eradicated from upwards of 20 terror groups active in Afghanistan and Pakistan .\nTrump \u2019 s warning to the latter nation marked perhaps the most significant rhetorical \u2013 and diplomatic \u2013 shift .\nHe said bluntly that Pakistan \u201c often gives safe haven to agents of chaos , violence and terror , \u201d a situation made worse by the tensions between Pakistan and India , two nuclear-armed neighbors .\nTrump said a \u201c pillar \u201d of the new strategy is a change in approach to Pakistan . \u201c We can no longer be silent about Pakistan \u2019 s safe havens for terrorist organizations , the Taliban , and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond , \u201d he said .\nComplaining that Pakistan houses the terrorists the U.S. is fighting as they take billions in aid , Trump said , \u201c That will have to change . \u201d\nTrump \u2019 s stance on Afghanistan has shifted over the years . Prior to his candidacy , Trump called for U.S. troops to \u201c leave Afghanistan immediately \u201d and \u201c rebuild the US first \u201d on Twitter in 2013 , even agreeing with then-President Barack Obama on withdrawing troops .\nBut since taking office , Trump has been stepping up military action in Afghanistan . The Trump administration has ramped up airstrikes in the region with 1,984 U.S. bombs dropped in Afghanistan between January and July of this year , compared with 705 dropped during the same time period in 2016 \u2013 that \u2019 s a 181 percent increase , according to U.S. Air Force data .\nIn his address , Trump admitted his \u201c original instinct \u201d was to pull out of the warzone . But he said he studied the issue and held \u201c many meetings , over many months \u201d with the Cabinet and generals to complete the new military plan . He said a \u201c rapid exit \u201d would be unacceptable , citing the example of Iraq as a cautionary tale .\nThe president began his address with words of unity , after a week of political turbulence and racial and cultural divide after attacks in Charlottesville , Va .\n\u201c Loyalty to our nation demands loyalty to one another . Love for America requires love for all of its people . We can not remain a force for peace in the world if we are not at peace with each other , \u201d Trump said .\nAhead of his primetime address , Fox News learned that the president had signed off on sending an additional 4,000 troops to Afghanistan , adding to the current estimated 8,400 U.S. troops already stationed in the region .\n`` I 'm proud , I 'm relieved . I 'm proud of the fact that President Trump made a national security decision , not a political decision . I 'm proud of the fact that he listened to the generals and most proud of the fact that he shows the will to stand up to radical Islam . I 'm relieved that he did not take the advice to withdraw which would 've been disastrous , or create a mercenary army , '' Sen.
