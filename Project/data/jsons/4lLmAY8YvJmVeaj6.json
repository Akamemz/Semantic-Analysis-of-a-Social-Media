Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross appears headed to the Commerce Department . Steve Bannon , another Goldman alum , will work steps from the Oval Office . JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon remains a possibility as Treasury secretary and will serve as an outside adviser if he does n't get the job .\nIt \u2019 s a restoration of Wall Street power \u2014 and a potential flip in the way the industry is regulated \u2014 perhaps unparalleled in American history .\n\u201c You would have to go back to the 1920s to see so much Wall Street influence coming to Washington , \u201d said Charles Geisst , a Wall Street historian at Manhattan College . \u201c It \u2019 s the most dramatic turnaround one could imagine . That \u2019 s the truly astonishing part . \u201d\nThe Dodd-Frank financial reform law that bedeviled the industry for years and cost banks untold billions could soon get burned to the ground . Bank stocks are soaring . Trump is going around Manhattan promising to lower rich people \u2019 s taxes . And industry critics led by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2014 long in ascendance \u2014 are seeing their populist power deflate .\nThe anti-banker culture of Washington has been turned on its head in an instant . And the industry can barely believe its good fortune . \u201c Those of us who have been around D.C. for a long time , are we relieved that we are not going to be subpoenaed every week ? Of course we are , \u201d said Richard Hunt , head of the Consumer Bankers Association .\nBank stocks are up by around 10 percent since Trump \u2019 s win , according to the KBW Bank Index , as investors contemplate an agenda tailormade for the industry including deregulation and potentially higher interest rates sparked by significant deficit spending . Bankers themselves also stand to make a killing . Massive tax cuts , including an elimination of the estate tax and big reductions for top earners seem like slam dunks in Trump \u2019 s Washington .\nWall Street bankers and their Washington lobbyists are quietly celebrating . They went from expecting fresh crackdowns from a Hillary Clinton administration with Warren wielding heavy influence to the cusp of a deregulatory bonanza with Republicans in complete control of Washington .\n\u201c There is a joke going around here that if I \u2019 d have known how good Trump was going to be for Wall Street , I \u2019 d have campaigned for him , \u201d said one Goldman Sachs executive who declined to be identified by name speaking about the incoming president . \u201c What people are reacting to is this incredible cultural shift .
