''\nIf equal probabilities of achieving some goal is your definition of fairness , then we should all get together -- people of every race , color , creed , national origin , political ideology and sexual preference -- and stipulate that life has never been fair , anywhere or any time in all the millennia of recorded history .\nI know that I never had an equal chance to become a great ballet dancer like Rudolph Nureyev . The thought of becoming a ballet dancer never once crossed my mind in all the years when I was growing up in Harlem .
