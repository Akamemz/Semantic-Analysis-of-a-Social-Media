Enough time for the surprise of Trump \u2019 s victory to sink in . Enough time to get a look at Trump in the White House , and to assess his performance as president .\nMiller , 79 , a Democrat and the former mayor of Bangor , Pennsylvania , has not been impressed by Trump \u2013 but it would be inaccurate to say that Miller is surprised , either , because , as he puts it , he never mistook Trump for a political savior . It is a view shared by many of the customers at his paint store , he said .\n\u201c Trump \u2019 s losing support because of his , of the complete stupidity \u2013 you know , maybe we should give him an IQ test with others , \u201d Miller said , referring to Trump \u2019 s recent challenge to secretary of state Rex Tillerson to compare IQ tests . \u201c People are getting fed up with that . But there \u2019 s not much of an alternative . We \u2019 ll elect someone in four years . So .\nConversations with Trump voters as the anniversary of the 8 November election nears do not typically reveal such regret . Most people who voted for the president are still solidly behind him , at least in Northampton County , Pennsylvania , which voted for Barack Obama twice before opting for Trump last fall .\nFor our series The Promise , \u2588\u2588\u2588 has been interviewing Trump supporters in Northampton since before the inauguration , to gauge whether support for the president in this key bellwether county is changing , and to find out whether Trump voters feel that the president has delivered on his promise to Make America Great Again .\nTrump \u2019 s core supporters in the region are still with him , although the president appears to have slipped with impulsive or protest voters like Miller , said Christopher Borick , director of the Institute of Public Opinion at Muhlenberg College in neighboring Lehigh County .\n\u201c There \u2019 s a difference , right ? \u201d said Borick . \u201c There \u2019 s the Trump voter , and there are people who voted for Trump last year . And Trump voters are still every bit as passionate , or even more so , than they were last year in Northampton County .

Last year , Clinton nearly matched Obama \u2019 s performance in Northampton , but she lost the county by 5,461 votes as Trump won some Democrats and saw a surge in first-time and dormant voter turnout on his way to narrowly winning the state by 0.7 % of the votes cast .\nIt \u2019 s too early to judge the battle lines for future elections . But it \u2019 s clear that the sense of disillusionment that created an opening for Trump in places like Northampton did not go away , and may only have deepened , with his victory .\nJeff Fox , 57 , of Pen Argyl , Pennsylvania , said he reluctantly voted for Trump \u201c given the situation \u201d . But Fox lamented the \u201c lack of civility \u201d in politics , frustration with which drove him to switch his party registration from Republican to Independent before last year \u2019 s election .\n\u201c I have very rarely heard the real reason I think that Donald Trump won , \u201d said Fox .\nFor many people who follow US politics from the coasts or overseas , Trump \u2019 s presidency can seem like a string of endless scandals . Trump personally promises $ 25,000 to the father of a fallen soldier which he then fails to deliver until it becomes a news story . Trump blasts football players for kneeling during the national anthem and calls press freedom \u201c frankly disgusting \u201d . Trump responds to a white supremacist march in Charlottesville , Virginia , by saying \u201c both sides \u201d were responsible for ensuing violence . The list goes on .\nBut viewed from the other end of the telescope , the list isn \u2019 t a parade of offenses . It \u2019 s a list of examples of how Trump \u2019 s words or his intentions are repeatedly twisted by the media , which seem to regard the president as an enemy .

That \u2019 s who he is . But I think to take what he said and twist it into , you know , \u2018 He supports racists and white supremacists \u2019 \u2013 I mean , c \u2019 mon . No . Taking little soundbites \u2013 no . Not if you look at the whole picture .\n\u201c What I \u2019 m saying is that there are people that stir the pot and contribute to a lack of civility in discourse , that are blind to the fact that they themselves contribute to the lack of civil discourse , and blame it all on Trump , for example . \u201d\nFor 10 weeks every year , from mid-October through Christmas , the city of Bethlehem suspends an ordinance prohibiting the placement of debris in the street to allow for leaf clearance .

Local cheers went up last month when the US commerce department released data showing that the Lehigh Valley , where Northampton is located , had set a record for economic output in 2016 , with gains in transportation , warehousing , insurance , real estate and manufacturing . Warehouse workers are enjoying a bidding war for their services , the local Morning Call newspaper reported recently . Economic clouds linger , especially in the county \u2019 s northern reaches . But , in general , the picture is sunny .\nMatthew Dietz , 40 , is a corporate pilot flying out of the Allentown airport who grew up in the Slate Belt in the north of the county . He \u2019 s busy , but a lot of people in the Slate Belt have not regained a level of employment they knew when the region \u2019 s clothing mills and slate quarries were still booming , he said .\nThough the area has not seen a direct economic bounce from Trump , Dietz said , support for him remains solid .\n\u201c I think those that were for him before the election are still there , and those that were against are still in that camp as well , \u201d he said . \u201c I agree with a lot of the stuff that he \u2019 s working towards , and of course if he wasn \u2019 t so vocal , I think he \u2019 d get a little bit more done . But that \u2019 s his style that he was elected on , so .\n\u201c Locally , we haven \u2019 t necessarily seen any new jobs or anything created up there , but obviously most everyone has retirement locked up in the stock market , which is great and gives them some security .\n\u201c On the local level , I \u2019 d say that \u2019 s the biggest impact that we \u2019 ve seen . \u201d\nTrump regularly touts the huge surge in the stock market since he was elected , and his supporters are likewise quick to point out the Wall Street gains as an example of how life is good under Trump .\n\u201c We \u2019 re full employment here , pretty much , \u201d said D \u2019 Ambrosio , the barber . \u201c The one thing that the little guy got for him is the Dow hit 23,000 , and if you have a 401 ( k ) [ retirement savings plan ] , they see it growing . Even the guys that don \u2019 t like him say it \u2019 s the Trump effect . \u201d\nFrank Hawkey , who worked at Bethlehem steel for 31 years and who brands Trump a \u201c psychopath \u201d , said that at his current job as a bus driver , \u201c tons \u201d of Trump voters had grown sour on the president , though \u201c you still have that few that say , \u2018 he \u2019 s doing a great job , look at the stock market . \u2019\n\u201c Oh really ? That \u2019 s who he wants to help . The people who have stocks .

Such a tax was needed , Haines said , to create the kind of renaissance in US manufacturing that Trump described during the campaign .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think we \u2019 ve seen the dramatic changes with new manufacturing opening , coming back from overseas , for example , which you would hope to see \u2013 but it is going to take awhile , \u201d Haines said . \u201c With the exception of the border tax , I think he \u2019 s still trying to enact his bold agenda , and that \u2019 s why I support him . \u201d\nTrump voters who admit to impatience with the enactment of key planks in his agenda \u2013 tax cuts , border wall construction , healthcare reform , a travel ban \u2013 to a person blame Congress , not the president , for the delays .\nLance Prator , mayor of Portland in the extreme north-east of the county , said he wanted to see a border wall built \u201c because you need to take care of the home front , \u201d but he did not feel impatient about it .\n\u201c Even in Portland , we work at the speed of government , \u201d Prator said . \u201c I understand the speed of government . You can \u2019 t just magically wave a wand and build a wall . It \u2019 ll probably be 25 years after it \u2019 s all said and done that the first brick will be put down . \u201d\nIt was a nice day for a ballgame , but the IronPigs minor league baseball team had already lost their league and the season was long over .

That that has kind of expanded and accelerated . Things have taken on a much more abrasive nature . I \u2019 m not sure where it \u2019 s coming from .\n\u201c You can point to Trump \u2019 s election , but it \u2019 s not always political , and it \u2019 s almost as if there \u2019 s still a wake that \u2019 s following everything , that still \u2013 everything else is still getting washed through , after years of being submerged . It \u2019 s something else . \u201d\nJeff Fox , up in Pen Argyl , saw the same thing . \u201c I think if Trump ran today , it would be messy , \u201d Fox said . \u201c I think the problem is \u2013 me personally \u2013 I believe that the problem really goes beyond politics . It comes to how we treat one another , how we converse with one another . \u201d\nFor Duane Miller in his paint store , the picture was no rosier . \u201c The people are disgusted , \u201d he said . \u201c They \u2019 re absolutely saying , we don \u2019 t care . Tax cut \u2013 who believes it ? Healthcare \u2013 who believes it ?\n\u201c The political climate for the average American , from my point of view here in the little town of Bangor , is one of disbelief . The American people don \u2019 t believe anything any more . And that \u2019 s where the apathy is overwhelming . \u201d",

Read more\n\n\u201cYou can point to Trump\u2019s election, but it\u2019s not always political, and it\u2019s almost as if there\u2019s still a wake that\u2019s following everything, that still \u2013 everything else is still getting washed through, after years of being submerged. It\u2019s something else.\u201d\n\nJeff Fox, up in Pen Argyl, saw the same thing. \u201cI think if Trump ran today, it would be messy,\u201d Fox said. \u201cI think the problem is \u2013 me personally \u2013 I believe that the problem really goes beyond politics. It comes to how we treat one another, how we converse with one another.\u201d\n\nFor Duane Miller in his paint store, the picture was no rosier. \u201cThe people are disgusted,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re absolutely saying, we don\u2019t care. Tax cut \u2013 who believes it? Healthcare \u2013 who believes it?\n\n\u201cThe political climate for the average American, from my point of view here in the little town of Bangor, is one of disbelief. The American people don\u2019t believe anything any more. And that\u2019s where the apathy is overwhelming.\u201d\n\nSign up for regular email dispatches throughout the year to hear from Tom and the people of Northampton County",
