    "content": "Senate Democrats have set Thursday as the date for the first major gun showdown in Congress since the Connecticut school shootings , saying they will put their gun control bill on the chamber floor and dare Republicans to filibuster it .\nAt least nine Republicans have signaled that they will vote with Democrats to bring the bill to the floor , but it \u2019 s unclear whether Democrats will be united . If the bill doesn \u2019 t get 60 votes , the chamber won \u2019 t be able to begin debating it \u2014 much less see it through to passage .\n\u201c We \u2019 re moving forward on this bill . The American people deserve a vote on this legislation . And I \u2019 m going forward on this regardless of whether it \u2019 s a compromise or not , \u201d Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , Nevada Democrat , told reporters as he laid out his strategy Tuesday afternoon .\nThe vote Thursday will be the first in either chamber of Congress since the December rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown , Conn. , in which a young gunman massacred 20 students and six adults at the school .\nPresident Obama has stepped up pressure for Congress to pass a broad set of gun controls , including banning military-style semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines , and universal background checks for all gun purchases .\nBut the bill Mr. Reid will bring to the floor doesn \u2019 t include the weapons and magazine bans . Instead , it expands background checks to encompass almost all private transfers , imposes new penalties on gun traffickers and \u201c straw purchasers , \u201d and allocates $ 40 million to bolster school safety .\nSEE ALSO : Rep. Peter King says Senate gun control filibuster would be \u2018 just wrong \u2019\nMr. Reid said he will allow the gun and magazine bans to be brought to the floor as amendments , where they will likely need 60 votes to pass \u2014 something neither is likely to achieve .\nBut Mr. Reid said Tuesday he isn \u2019 t sure he has the 60 votes needed just to overcome a filibuster . While nearly a dozen Republicans have signaled they are willing to buck their party and halt the filibuster , some Democrats could join the Republicans .\nDemocratic Sens . Max Baucus of Montana and Mark L.

If they all vote to proceed , Mr. Reid would need to sway five Republicans to move forward , and more than that number have said they will oppose an effort to delay debate .\nSens .
