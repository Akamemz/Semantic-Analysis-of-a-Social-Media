    "content": "This year was a big one for environment and climate news . America moved to limit greenhouse gas emissions from coal plants for the first time . China entered into a historic climate deal with the U.S. , and 100 governments signed off on the most comprehensive report on climate science yet . Politicians bickered over the Keystone XL pipeline , the \u201c war on coal , \u201d and whether climate change even exists . There was drought , wildfires , and devastating pollution .\nWith so much news , it \u2019 s inevitable that some of the coverage would be skewed , misleading , or flat-out wrong . Indeed , some news networks ignored some of the year \u2019 s most important climate and environment news entirely , while others gave disproportionate air time to talking heads who reject the basic scientific consensus on climate change .\nHere are ten times the media messed up covering the environment and the climate this year , in no particular order .\nWhen the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) releases a report , it \u2019 s a pretty big deal . For its Fifth Assessment Report released in April , more than 1,271 people were nominated to partake in its writing , of which 309 were chosen as lead authors , and 436 as contributing authors . Almost 800 men and women of at least 73 different nationalities took part in writing it . It was an enormous , momentous effort in scientific consensus .\nThe results , too , were incredibly newsworthy . Among other things , the report concluded that even low levels of climate change over the next 100 years would result in the \u201c breakdown of food systems \u201d and an increase in violent conflict .\nDespite this , network news largely ignored the report . CNN literally gave less than two minutes to it . Fox News gave it five minutes , and mostly just to say that it was irrelevant because climate change is not real .\nThe Nation called it a \u201c hack job , \u201d Media Matters called it \u201c one-sided , \u201d and even the Columbia Journalism Review said it was \u201c the latest in a series of embarrassments . \u201d\nAll those were in response to a segment aired by 60 Minutes this past January which sought to document the fall of the clean tech industry . 60 Minutes reporter Leslie Stahl deemed her story \u201c The Cleantech Crash , \u201d and portrayed the industry as dead on arrival .\nAside from the fact that the piece made no mention of climate change \u2014 which is one of the stronger arguments behind cleantech \u2014 the report largely passed over explosive growth in wind power , solar power , LED lights and electric vehicles .\nA \u2588\u2588\u2588 interview with one of experts featured on the 60 Minutes segment detailed that the show knowingly ignored that growth to make its point . Robert Rapier , Chief Technology Officer at Merica International , was interviewed by 60 Minutes and spoke to them at length about cleantech \u2019 s many successes , but none of his comments about those successes were included in the segment .\nIn October , InsideClimateNews revealed that NPR had reduced its environment and climate reporting team to one part-time reporter . Earlier in the year , the public radio station had three full-time reporters and one editor dedicated to the beat .\nNPR \u2019 s senior supervising editor for its science desk Anne Gudenkauf explained the decision to reduce climate and environment reporting staff by saying she didn \u2019 t \u201c feel like [ the environment ] necessarily requires dedicated reporters. \u201d She also said the move was driven by an interest to expand coverage of other topics .\nThe move was met with criticism from journalists and climate advocates , including climate communications expert Dr. Robert J. Brulle . \u201c I would have thought NPR would take a proactive stance toward the coverage of climate change , given its charter to address issues of national concern , \u201d Brulle told Joe Romm when the news was revealed . \u201c Sadly , it seems that instead of being part of the solution , NPR has now become part of the problem . \u201d\n60 Minutes \u2019 controversial cleantech report was not the only time the show was criticized this year for leaving out crucial information in stories about the environment . In November , Leslie Stahl ran a report on groundwater scarcity driven by drought , but did not mention climate change once in the entire segment .\nWhile Stahl was lauded for bringing attention to the critical and little-known issue of groundwater depletion and how it impacts communities across the United States , she was also criticized for \u201c completely ignor [ ing ] \u201d climate change .\nAs Media Matters pointed out at the time , human-caused global warming is projected to reduce groundwater resources \u201c significantly in most dry subtropical regions , \u201d according to a U.N. climate science report . In addition , a study from Simon Fraser University determined that climate change \u201c may already be exacerbating water shortages in many areas around the globe . \u201d\nThe problem with neglecting to mention climate change in a discussion about groundwater depletion is that it makes it seem like the issue is one that can \u2019 t be controlled . Or at the very least , it prevents the discussion of one proposed solution to groundwater depletion : reducing carbon emissions .\nMultiple times in 2014 , network news perpetuated a false claim that Keystone XL would create 42,000 enduring jobs . In fact , it would only create 35 full-time jobs , and 15 temporary contractors , according to the State Department .\nThe 42,000 jobs claim comes from the State Department \u2019 s report that the pipeline could \u201c support , \u201d not create , 42,100 jobs , more than 99 percent of which would be temporary . The company behind the project , TransCanada , itself has estimated that the pipeline would create no more than 2,500 to 4,650 temporary direct construction jobs for two years .\nIn October , Politico ran an article saying BP \u201c didn \u2019 t ruin the gulf \u201d when it spilled more than 200 million gallons of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 . The article argued that the Gulf of Mexico has an \u201c inherent resilience \u201d when it comes to oil spills and that environmentalists have been overreacting about the spill \u2019 s impact .\nThe piece looked , on its face , like a regular piece of journalism , written by a journalist employed by Politico Magazine . Problem was , it was actually written by BP senior vice president of communications Geoff Morrell .\nThe original article did not include a disclaimer that the piece was an opinion , nor did it disclose that BP had written it until the bottom of the piece . The magazine eventually changed the header to clearly read \u201c Opinion , \u201d but not before receiving a flood of criticism over Politico \u2019 s lucrative relationship with BP as a frequent advertiser on the site \u2019 s daily email newsletter \u201c Playbook. \u201d At the time , a Politico spokesperson denied that ads in Playbook would have anything to do with the lack of a disclaimer in the BP oil spill article .\nHow the headline of Politico Magazine \u2019 s article looked before and after it was criticized . CREDIT : Politico.com/screenshot\nNetwork news stations had a nasty habit this year of hosting one-on-one debates featuring one person who thinks climate change is real , and one person who does not . There were two problems with this , the first being that most of the debates were between people who are not actually experts in the field of climate science . The second and more important problem is that a one-on-one debate implies to the viewer that the two sides of the \u201c is climate change real \u201d argument have equal value . They do not .\nEvery time a network news station airs a one-on-one debate over whether climate change is real , they are giving a hugely disproportionate amount of legitimacy to a claim that most scientists vehemently disagree with . Indeed , some 97 out of 100 actively publishing climate scientists agree that humans are causing global warming .\nAll this is why it was so disappointing when NBC \u2019 s \u201c Meet the Press \u201d decided to hold a debate between Bill Nye , a television personality and science educator , and Marsha Blackburn , a notoriously anti-climate change Republican congresswoman from Tennessee . While host David Gregory tried nobly to steer the conversation in a productive direction , it didn \u2019 t really matter \u2014 the format of the debate meant that Blackburn would use her time to cast unsubstantiated doubt on climate science and tout the \u201c benefits \u201d of carbon emissions on agricultural production .\nSoon after former New York Times data guru Nate Silver launched his highly anticipated news site FiveThirtyEight this year , the site began to attract a good deal of attention \u2014 but not the kind it was hoping for . Multiple climate scientists condemned the first climate article on the site , saying it used \u201c deeply misleading \u201d data to make its claims .\nThe article and its author , Roger Pielke Jr. , argued that increased wealth and development is the principal cause of growing losses from extreme weather events \u2014 not more extreme weather from climate change . But four climate scientists refuted the data analysis as too simplistic , saying it ignored data on increased disaster preparation measures and technological innovations , and only looked at rare , land-falling tropical cyclones .\nPielke strongly pushed back against the criticisms of his work , but damage had already been done . Public pressure drove Silver to publish a rebuttal to Pielke \u2019 s piece from MIT climate scientist Kerry Emmanuel , and Pielke never wrote another climate article for FiveThirtyEight again .\nBoth Fox News and CNN gave air time this year to John Coleman , a co-founder of the Weather Channel and former TV weatherman , to preach climate denial in the wake of the latest U.N. report . On his appearance on CNN , Coleman proclaimed , \u201c Hello America , there is no global warming . \u201d\nIn his interview with Fox News \u2019 Megyn Kelly , Coleman was lauded as a \u201c top meteorologist , \u201d though he does not have a degree in meteorology . But even if he did have a meteorology degree , it wouldn \u2019 t really matter \u2014 meteorologists are not climate scientists . As pointed out by Media Matters , climatologists \u2019 models are different than meteorologists \u2019 and they ask different questions .
