    "content": "This week , the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case of Masterpiece Cakeshop owner Jack Phillips , the man who refused to create a specialty wedding cake for a same-sex couple in Colorado in 2012 . Yet the stories that dominate coverage distort the public 's understanding of the case and its serious implications .\nFor one thing , no matter how many times people repeat it , the case is n't about discrimination or challenging gay marriage . But when the news first broke , USA Today , for example , tweeted , `` The Supreme Court has agreed to reopen the national debate over same-sex marriage . '' The headline ( and story ) on the website was worse ; it read , `` Supreme Court will hear religious liberty challenge to gay weddings . '' Others similarly framed the case . ( And , do n't worry , `` religious liberty '' is almost always solidly ensconced inside quotation marks to indicate that social conservatives are just using it as a facade . )\nThere is an impulse to frame every issue as a clash between the tolerant and the closed-minded . But the Masterpiece case does n't challenge , undermine or relitigate the issue of same-sex marriage in America . Gay marriage was n't even legal in Colorado when this incident occurred .\nSo , the Associated Press ' headline , `` Supreme Court to Decide If Baker Can Refuse Gay Couple Wedding Cake , '' and story are also wrong . As is The New York Times headline `` Justices to Hear Case on Baker 's Refusal to Serve Gay Couple , '' which was later changed to the even worse headline `` Justices to Hear Case on Religious Objections to Same-Sex Marriage . ''\nA person with only passing interest in this case might be led to believe that Phillips is fighting to hang a `` No Gays Allowed '' sign in his shop . In truth , he never refused to serve a gay couple . He did n't even really refuse to sell David Mullins and Charlie Craig a wedding cake . They could have bought without incident . Everything in his shop was available to gays and straights and anyone else who walked in his door . What Phillips did was refuse to use his skills to design and bake a unique cake for a gay wedding . Phillips did n't query about anyone 's sexual orientation . It was the Colorado Civil Rights Commission that took it upon itself to peer into Phillips ' soul , indict him and destroy his business over a thought crime .\nLike many other bakers , florists , photographers and musicians\u2014and millions of other Christians\u2014Phillips holds genuine longstanding religious convictions . If Mullins and Craig had demanded that Phillips create an erotic-themed cake , the baker would have similarly refused for religious reasons , just as he had with other costumers . If a couple had asked him to design a specialty cake that read `` Congrats on the abortion , Jenny ! '' I 'm certain he would have refused them as well , even though abortions are legal . It 's not the people ; it 's the message .\nIn its tortured decision , the Colorado Court of Appeals admitted as much , contending that while Phillips did n't overtly discriminate against the couple , `` the act of same-sex marriage is closely correlated to Craig 's and Mullins ' sexual orientation , '' so it could divine his real intentions .\nIn other words , the threshold for denying religious liberty and free expression is the presence of advocacy or a political opinion that conflates with faith . The court has effectively tasked itself with determining when religion is allowed to matter to you . Or , in other words , if SCOTUS upholds the lower court ruling , it will empower unelected civil rights commissions\u2014which are typically stacked with hard-left authoritarians\u2014to decide when your religious actions are appropriate .\nHow could any honest person believe this was the Constitution 's intent ? There was a time , I 'm told , when the state would n't substantially burden religious exercise and would use the least restrictive means to further compelling interests . Today , the state can substantially burden a Christian because he 's hurt the wrong person 's feelings .\nJudging from the emails and social media reactions I 've gotten regarding this case , people are not only instinctively antagonistic because of the players involved but also because they do n't understand the facts . In this era of identity politics , some have been programmed to reflexively side with the person making accusations of status-based discrimination , all in an effort to empower the state to coerce a minority of people to see the world their way .\nWell , not all people . In 2014 , a Christian activist named William Jack went to a Colorado bakery and requested two cakes in the shape of a Bible , one to be decorated with the Bible verses `` God hates sin . Psalm 45:7 '' and `` Homosexuality is a detestable sin . Leviticus 18:22 , '' and the other cake to be decorated with another passage . The bakery refused .
