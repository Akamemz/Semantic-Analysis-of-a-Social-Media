    "content": "Something very American is happening in Dostoyevsky Hall at the Main Press Center of the Sochi Olympics .\nThe formal press conference for the US short track speedskating team has ended , and Jordan Malone is sitting to the side of a stage , completely at ease , chatting with the journalists who have huddled around him like freezing men before a fire .\nAt the moment , he 's talking about how his aunt Dina has to buy his blades ( $ 500 a set ) , because he frankly does n't have that much money to spare . It is the archetypal tale of the American Olympian : passionate , supremely talented , and nearly broke .\nYet the scene unfolding in Dostoyevsky Hall on the Tuesday before the Sochi Olympics opened echoes in ways deeper than the obvious . What Malone says , how he is acting , and the fact that he is even here \u2013 paraded before the media when he would almost certainly rather be doing anything else \u2013 speaks to what has made the United States unique in the global Olympic movement .\nArguably no other nation 's Olympic team is so intimately intertwined with the people of the nation it represents , because no other Olympic team is so dependent upon those people for its success .\nAmong top Olympic nations , the United States is alone in providing no government funding . This , as Malone will tell you , can create its challenges . Malone 's competitors from South Korea probably do n't need their aunts to buy their blades .\nYet beneath the very real narrative of hardship this creates among many American Olympic athletes is an equally profound narrative of success . The United States is expected to top the overall medal table in Sochi , and , ironically , the very lack of government funding could in some ways be cited as a driving cause .\nWithout government largess upon which to depend , the United States Olympic Committee ( USOC ) has been forced to run itself like a business , accounting for every dollar and constantly reanalyzing itself to make sure those dollars are spent in the most effective way .\nIn striving to act like an accountable business , the USOC has excelled at selling itself to sponsors , marketing its team , and establishing spending mechanisms that target the most successful and promising athletes .\nAnd in struggling to make a living playing the sports they love , American athletes have received a clear ( if at times brutal ) message : The winners get the money , and with no golden parachute of government-funded stipends to fall back on , success becomes a sort of Olympic Darwinism \u2013 a natural selection of the best team the nation can produce .\nHere in Dostoyevsky Hall , that entire process culminates in a slight , soft-spoken short track skater who had to claw his way back from injury and the related time away from the sport ( and the harsh funding cut that came with it ) to make it to Sochi .\nAlong the way , Malone has had to turn to the Internet to ask strangers for money for rent , food , and skating boots . And now that he 's made it here , the USOC has pushed him before a crowd of American journalists to tell his story , because it knows the more Malone and his teammates inspire the American public , the more money will flow to the organization from sponsors and donors .\nThese days , a handful of countries hold pre-Olympics press conferences with their athletes , as the USOC has done in the Main Press Center this week and in recent Olympics past . Canada , in particular , has latched onto the idea . Britain , Japan , and France also have followed suit .\nBut most do n't . Do n't expect Austrian alpine skiers to process through the Main Press Center to be bombarded by questions about whether their moms will be in the stands or what the security is like in the Olympic Village . No journalist is keeping his schedule open for the Russian cross-country team to make an appearance .\nThe implication is obvious and has merit : They do n't need to court the media , and their athletes have better things to do .\nBut the fact that the USOC has to be accountable to the public ( in this case through the media ) has a deep effect on how the Olympics are viewed in America . Foreigners watching NBC 's coverage understandably complain about how it 's all profiles and weepy backstory . To the USOC , however , this is simply a matter of promoting its product to potential investors .\nAt a press conference this week , Lisa Baird , head of marketing for the USOC , had her sell down . The organization has suffered no loss of revenue from the controversies surrounding Sochi \u2013 from the Russian antigay law to security concerns \u2013 because its partners love that US Olympic athletes reflect the diversity of America at large , she said .\nNotably , she did n't say the sponsors loved luging and curling , but the athletes .\nVisa did not invest in the US women 's ski jumping team because Americans love ski jumping . It invested in the women 's ski jumping team because Americans likes them : Their personalities and the story of their years-long struggle finally to be accepted as a sport at the Olympic Games this year .\nThat sponsorship brought the US women 's ski jumping team $ 251,000 , which does n't sound like much until you realize the US Ski and Snowboard Association ( USSA ) , the sport 's governing body under the umbrella of the USOC , gives the team only $ 50,000 a year .\nAt times in the past , the team has actually held bake sales .\nSuch stories are , of course , intimately woven into the American Olympic narrative . After a string of poor results , alpine skier Marco Sullivan had to `` buy his way back on the team '' he said at a press conference Thursday \u2013 meaning spending a lot of his own money as USSA money dried up along with his results .\nMalone and many of his teammates had to do much the same thing , and in their case , that meant turning to the Internet .
