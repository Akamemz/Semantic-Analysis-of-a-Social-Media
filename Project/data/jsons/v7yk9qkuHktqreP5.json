The process for the trial still isn \u2019 t clear , but there are signs that it will likely be smoother sailing for the president going forward : Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he will coordinate with White House counsel , and there \u2019 s no indication that the Senate is anywhere near the 67 votes needed to remove Trump from office . And according to our impeachment and removal polling trackers , there isn \u2019 t broad public support for that either \u2014 just 47 percent of Americans favor removing Trump .\nBut in the latest installment of our survey with Ipsos , where we use Ipsos \u2019 s KnowledgePanel to poll the same group of respondents every two weeks , a majority ( 57 percent ) of Americans said they think Trump committed an impeachable offense . Fifty-two percent said they think Trump \u2019 s actions regarding Ukraine or his refusal to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry constitute enough evidence to remove him from office .\nThat might seem like good news for Democrats , since other recent polls have put support for removal in the low- to mid-40s \u2014 but the picture is complicated . As always , there are big partisan divisions : The vast majority of Democrats think there \u2019 s sufficient evidence to remove Trump from office , while most Republicans think there isn \u2019 t . And there is still a small but notable number of Americans who think there is enough evidence for removal , but also believe the upcoming presidential election \u2014 and not Congress \u2014 should determine whether Trump remains in office . Consistent with previous rounds of our survey , we found that about 15 percent of Americans think that there is enough evidence to remove Trump from office on matters related to Ukraine or his attempts to stymie the impeachment inquiry , but also think his fate should be decided by voters in the 2020 election , not Congress .\nMost Americans want the trial to expand on the evidence in the impeachment articles\nThere might not be a broad consensus about whether Trump should be removed from office , but our survey found that a majority of the public is on the same page about one thing \u2014 they want a Senate trial with new witnesses who did not appear during the impeachment process in the House .\nAccording to the survey , 57 percent of Americans think it would be better if the upcoming trial included new witnesses who could potentially shed light on Trump \u2019 s conduct , while 39 percent said it would be better to keep the focus solely on the evidence introduced in the House hearings and included in the articles of impeachment , without calling new witnesses . Perhaps unsurprisingly , 65 percent of Democrats support calling new witnesses in the Senate trial .

Democrats in Congress have been pressing Republican leaders to call senior White House aides like former national security advisor John Bolton and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney , who were reportedly involved in the freezing of U.S. military aid to Ukraine and a subsequent effort to get the freeze lifted . Trump and some congressional Republicans , meanwhile , have suggested that Joe Biden and his son Hunter should testify about Hunter \u2019 s time on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president , which Trump has portrayed as a conflict of interest that led to corrupt actions by Joe Biden , although there \u2019 s no evidence to support that claim .\nThe survey also found that Americans are divided on House Democrats \u2019 current strategy of refusing to transmit the articles of impeachment until their concerns around a fair trial have been addressed .

And while the overall share of respondents who think Trump committed an impeachable offense hasn \u2019 t really shifted , there is evidence that people are getting more certain in their views \u2014 and those people mostly think Trump did something impeachable .\nBack in mid-November , when we polled respondents for the first time , people who thought Trump had committed an impeachable offense weren \u2019 t much more certain of their view than people who believed he hadn \u2019 t . About 75 percent of respondents who thought Trump \u2019 s behavior was impeachable were either \u201c absolutely \u201d or \u201c pretty \u201d certain of their view , compared to 71 percent of people who thought Trump \u2019 s conduct wasn \u2019 t impeachable . Now , though , 81 percent of respondents who think Trump committed an impeachable offense are certain of their view , while the share of respondents who think Trump \u2019 s conduct isn \u2019 t impeachable is at 72 percent , without a similar uptick .\nThis isn \u2019 t a huge swing , of course .
