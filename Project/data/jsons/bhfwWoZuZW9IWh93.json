    "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014President Trump said he wants to sign an executive order that ends the automatic right to citizenship for anyone born in the U.S. , ratcheting up his election-season remarks on immigration with a proposal many legal scholars said is unconstitutional .\nIn an interview published Tuesday morning , just ahead of next week \u2019 s midterms , Mr. Trump said he planned an executive order to end what is known as birthright citizenship , bypassing Congress and waving off the belief of many legal scholars that such a move would require a change to the Constitution .\n\u201c It was always told to me that you needed a constitutional amendment . Guess what ? You don \u2019 t , \u201d he told Axios . \u201c It \u2019 s in the process . It \u2019 ll happen , with an executive order . \u201d\nConstitutional scholars dismissed the idea , saying a president has no legal standing to end birthright citizenship with an executive order . \u201c It \u2019 s basically saying the president is above the Constitution , \u201d said Laura K. Donohue , a senior scholar at the Georgetown Center for the Constitution .\nThe White House didn \u2019 t further explain Mr. Trump \u2019 s assertion that he alone could make the move , and it didn \u2019 t provide further details about the scope of the proposed executive order or the timing .\n\u201c We will let you know when we have an announcement , \u201d White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said .\nBirthright citizenship is a pillar of U.S. immigration law and is protected by the Constitution \u2019 s 14th Amendment , which , among other goals , was designed to grant full citizenship to former slaves . But some conservatives who favor more restrictive immigration laws have opposed the policy , saying it improperly rewards the children of people in the country who lack proper documentation .\nMr. Trump \u2019 s proposal is the latest in a string of pronouncements as he seeks to invigorate GOP voters ahead of the midterms . He recently suggested a middle-income tax cut that appeared to surprise both his staff and lawmakers . Last week , he said he would seek to cut prices that Medicare pays for some prescription drugs , but that wouldn \u2019 t go into effect until late 2019 or 2020 .\nOn immigration , Mr. Trump has seized on a slow-moving migrant caravan headed toward the U.S.-Mexico border , part of his push to toughen rules on people seeking asylum in the U.S. Mr. Trump has previously said he opposed birthright citizenship , but he hadn \u2019 t floated an executive order nor included it in his list of requests during the latest round of congressional negotiations .\nThe Justice Department \u2019 s official position from 1995 , posted on its website , is that only a constitutional amendment can alter the citizenship provision ; a bill or executive order doing so would be \u201c unconstitutional on its face , \u201d the department \u2019 s Office of Legal Counsel concluded . A spokeswoman didn \u2019 t respond when asked if that opinion would now be reconsidered .\nThe 14th Amendment , ratified in 1868 , states , \u201c All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States. \u201d Some opponents of birthright citizenship have argued the \u201c subject to the jurisdiction thereof \u201d clause could be read to exclude babies born to people who were in the U.S. illegally .\nThat interpretation , however , runs contrary to the Constitution Annotated , published by the Library of Congress , which says the \u201c jurisdiction \u201d exclusion applies to \u201c children born of diplomatic representatives of a foreign state , children born of alien enemies in hostile occupation , or children of members of Indian tribes subject to tribal laws . \u201d\nThe Supreme Court has routinely applied the amendment broadly when it has been tested .\nCritics of birthright citizenship also have taken aim at what some call \u201c birth tourism , \u201d in which pregnant women travel to the U.S. in order to have children who receive the benefit of citizenship . Companies in China have attracted attention in recent years for advertising such services .\nAmending the Constitution is exceedingly difficult , requiring supermajority support from Congress and assent from 38 state legislatures , or a constitutional convention , the last of which was held in 1787 . As a workaround , Republican lawmakers have periodically introduced legislation to change the historic understanding of the 14th Amendment , without success . Rep. Steve King ( R. , Iowa ) has repeatedly done so , and Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R. , S.C. ) said Tuesday morning that he would push for another legislative effort .\n\u201c I plan to introduce legislation along the same lines as the proposed executive order , \u201d Mr. Graham wrote on Twitter while praising Mr. Trump . \u201c Finally , a president willing to take on this absurd policy of birthright citizenship . \u201d\nSen. Chuck Grassley ( R. , Iowa ) , chairman of the Judiciary Committee , said he would \u201c closely review \u201d any order from Mr. Trump , but he indicated any policy changes on immigration should be left to Congress .\nOthers openly disagreed with Mr. Trump .
