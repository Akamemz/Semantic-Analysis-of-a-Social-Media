Li , 37 , is a Chinese citizen from Chongqing , a megacity of some 30 million people , but has lived extensively in the United States , the reports say .\nA statistician who was working in Massachusetts for Biogen Inc. , the sponsor of the now infamous Boston meeting at the epicenter of the state \u2019 s COVID-19 outbreak , is being investigated in Beijing for allegedly flying to her native China while sick , not disclosing her exposure to coronavirus to the airline , and covering up her fever with drugs , according to reports in Chinese-based media .\nShe arrived in China on March 13 , and has been widely denounced in Chinese media in recent days , after a Beijing official cited her case at a news conference as an example of what not to do in the midst of a global pandemic that has killed thousands worldwide .\nLittle is known about what motivated this highly educated professional , living in pricey Greater Boston suburbia , to allegedly take a risk that now has her portrayed as an international villain in the fight against COVID-19 .\nThe Xinhua News Agency , an official Chinese government media outlet , reports that Li has the virus , but it is unclear if that report is based on a test taken in the United States or in China .\nA Biogen official said the company knew nothing of the controversy in Beijing until it was reported in Chinese media .\n\u201c We can confirm that Ms. Li was a US Biogen employee who made the personal decision to travel to China without informing the company and ignoring the guidance of health experts , \u201d said David Caouette , spokesman for the Cambridge-based biotechnical firm , in a statement Thursday . \u201c We are deeply dismayed by the situation as reported by the media in China . \u201d\nLi did not inform her superiors at Biogen that she was leaving , Caouette said . She left during a transition period when employees were beginning to work from home to combat the spread of the virus .\nBeijing investigators could not be directly reached by phone . Messages left on Li \u2019 s phone were not returned . The Globe made a number of unsuccessful attempts Thursday to reach people who know her . It is also unclear from Chinese news reports if reporters in China have sought comment from Li or her family .\nNinety-seven of the 328 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Massachusetts as of Thursday afternoon , or 30 percent , have been linked to Biogen \u2019 s Feb. 26-27 leadership meeting at the Marriott Long Wharf hotel on the Boston waterfront . The meeting brought together about 175 employees of the multinational biotechnical company , which makes therapies for neurological diseases . It is still unclear how or from whom the virus originally spread at the event , but within days , dozens of Biogen executives began feeling sick .\nLi did not attend the Long Wharf conference but had contact with someone who did , said Caouette .\nChinese media reports , quoting Beijing officials , say Li developed common symptoms of COVID-19 , such as a fever and a cough , while still in the United States , and visited a doctor here several times .\nShe was among a number of Biogen employees tested for COVID-19 in early March at Massachusetts General Hospital , but Li left the United States before the results of her test were known , according to a person with knowledge of her situation , who asked to be anonymous because the person was not authorized to speak about it .\nSometime in early March , Li apparently called for medical help in Belmont , reporting flu-like symptoms , and a Fire Department EMS crew responded to Li \u2019 s address , according to a statement released Thursday by the Belmont Health Department .

Before the plane departed from the Los Angeles airport around 2 a.m. , Li allegedly did not disclose her health status , or her family \u2019 s , to flight attendants , according to Chinese media reports .\nThe reports says Li is accused of taking antipyretics , which are anti-fever drugs , before her flight to reduce her fever so as to not alert airline officials measuring the body temperatures of passengers to screen for possible coronavirus infections .\nReports say that an hour after the plane took off , Li told a flight attendant she was uncomfortable and not feeling well , and she was moved to the rear of the cabin , separated from other passengers by a curtain . Only later did she disclose she had been running a fever , reports said . The flight landed after 13 hours in the air , around 5 a.m. local time the following day .\nChinese news reports say Li is being treated in a hospital for a coronavirus infection and that her husband has also tested positive .
