    "content": "Something extraordinary happened in Congress before they took their month-long August break . No , not that they passed a bill , though that has become a rare feat these days . This Congress , so obsessed with the deficit that they imposed a spending cap on themselves , and vowed that no new legislation would ever pass without being paid for , did just that last Thursday . Moreover , the same Republican House that has taken several dozen votes to repeal Obamacare passed this deficit-spending bill to further fund the country \u2019 s only system of socialized medicine .\nHow did this happen ? Because when you support the troops , federal spending is magic spending that doesn \u2019 t count .\nThe bill , signed by the president last Thursday , seeks to reform the Veterans Administration , though you can make a credible case that the new spending represents an attempt to undermine it . We \u2019 re only talking about an infinitesimal sliver of the federal budget , $ 10 billion in new spending spread out over a couple of years . But if the government allows itself to spend in reaction to an emergency without having to pay for it , suddenly a whole host of options come into play . It overturns so many false ideas that have perniciously made their way into the mainstream over the past several years , from the virtues of austerity to the inadequacies of economic stimulus . And it exposes how anything that has to do with the military gets a free pass , one that should be extended to all kinds of worthy policies .\nUnder the legislation passed by Congress , the $ 10 billion will go toward vouchers that enable any VA patient who experiences long wait times or lives more than 40 miles from the nearest VA facility to access private medical coverage . Another $ 6.3 billion in the bill goes toward hiring more VA doctors , upgrading current VA health centers , and entering into leases with 27 major medical facilities across the country .\nThat $ 6.3 billion gets paid for internally with offsets from the VA budget . But Congress was taken by surprise , amazingly , at the cost of private medical care . The Congressional Budget Office scored the private coverage aspect of the initial bill as costing $ 35 billion between now and 2016 . According to CBO , covering private care would cost $ 25 billion just in 2016 , when the entire VA budget costs $ 44 billion annually .\nCongressional negotiators got their hands around the cost by turning it into a pilot program , with a fixed limit to the spending . And it will be worth tracking to see how long it takes for that funding to dry up when routed through the inefficient and wasteful private healthcare system . In reality , only 0.6 percent of VA enrollees ever experienced wait times over 90 days ; this was a political rather than a policy problem . And it \u2019 s worth noting that many veterans advocates would rather have more money put into the specialized VA system than into back-door privatization , especially if growing the private care benefit means eroding the VA .\nBut Congress still had the bigger problem of how to fund that $ 10 billion , with the clock ticking before the statutorily mandated August recess ( that \u2019 s right , Congress is obligated by law to go on vacation after July 31 ) . So in the end , they decided not to pay for it .\nThey would not be able to get away with that , politically , with virtually any other priority of the federal government . Spending for national parks , medical research through the National Institutes of Health , food stamps , housing vouchers , anything else you can name , would require an offset . The Budget Control Act attempts to prevent Congress from spending above a top-line number on the discretionary budget for the next several years . Sequestration , most of which remains in effect , cuts spending rigidly without allowances . Paygo legislation disallows spending without offsets ; efforts like the VA bill require a special vote to waive that statute . Not even unemployment insurance for the large segment of long-term unemployed workers can get by without an offset , which is why it has yet to be renewed .\nMost reasonable people would consider being unemployed for months on end an emergency . But Congress finds it hard to rouse itself even with respect to unquestioned emergencies . The same week that they were handing out $ 10 billion for private voucher coverage through the VA , Republicans in both houses of Congress rejected $ 650 million in spending for wildfires along the West Coast , even as more than a dozen continue to burn .
