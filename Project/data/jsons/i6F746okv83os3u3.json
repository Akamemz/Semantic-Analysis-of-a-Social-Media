    "content": "As I write this here in Edinburgh at on Friday morning , the first thing to note is that the referendum on independence is all that everyone has been talking about in Scotland for months .\nHere 's how I can best describe the all-consuming nature of this event for Americans : it has been like the presidential election , and the Super Bowl , and the finale of both `` Breaking Bad , '' and `` American Idol , '' and the O.J . Simpson trial -- all rolled into one . It has been everywhere and everything .\nOpinions have been given on every radio and TV channel , in every pub , in every town center , and in the windows of houses , cars and businesses . And of course it is all over social media .\nBut more than the oral and visual representations , there has been something even more powerful and obvious , and that is the overwhelming atmosphere of engagement in the process , and a belief that things can be changed for the better .\nAs I watched the results come in during the wee hours of Friday morning , the most astonishing statistic was the percentage of Scots that had participated in the process . At the last U.K. parliamentary election there was a turnout of 64 % of the Scottish population . It has been reported that the average turnout on Thursday was 85 % and several regions of Scotland exceeded 90 % . This is unprecedented .\nAccordingly , there is no denying that the people of Scotland have spoken . It appears that the majority have rejected the notion that Scotland should be an independent country at this moment in time . For me , as one of the founders of Americans for an Independent Scotland , this is a very sad day .\nBut I prefer to look at this positively . Two years ago I was one of the original signatories to a Scottish Declaration of Independence in Edinburgh . At that time the polls suggested that less than 33 % of the country supported independence . Thursday , at least 45 % voted in favor of separation .\nSo the momentum towards independence is only going one way .\nIn a last minute effort to secure a no vote , the main parties at Westminster promised Scotland new powers . No one is arguing that Scotland should have fewer powers .\nScotland will have more control over its own affairs and in time , there will be another referendum , and ultimately I believe that Scotland will be an independent country .\nAbove all , whatever happens I am incredibly proud of Scotland right now . Not just for the fact that everyone was so engaged in the process , or for the new found self-belief , but for the way that this whole process has been conducted .\nYes there have been arguments , fallings-out , and a few broken eggs , but there has been no blood shed and no violence .\nThe national debate and the referendum journey has been a model for self-determination that will be the envy of the world . That such a fundamental question was resolved so democratically is of monumental credit to us . The world is watching on in admiration .\nLet me stress that again . The people of Scotland have shown the world how fundamental questions of nationhood and identity should be addressed and resolved . This is a hugely significant achievement .\nOne might even suggest that the fact that the Scots managed such a difficult process proves that the we are more than capable of running our own country . Such arguments will continue to be made . This is not the final chapter .\nIt has been a long night here in Edinburgh , and it is too soon to have a proper perspective on it all . But my feeling right now is that I will look back on this period of Scottish history with immense affection and pride .\nUltimately I expect that Thursday 's vote will be seen as another step forward towards independence . For almost half of the Scottish population , this is not the end . Rather , this is the final wake-up call for the United Kingdom .",
