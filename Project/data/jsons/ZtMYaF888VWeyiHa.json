    "content": "Matt touched on this yesterday , but I wanted to circle back to it because it 's indicative of the frustration with the media that many in the Trump White House have expressed -- especially the president himself . On Wednesday , House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes announced that he 'd seen evidence that members of Trump 's circle did have communications intercepted during the presidential transition . Those intercepts were `` incidental '' in nature , he said , and appeared to be legal . They did not pertain to Russia , he added . And yet those communications made the rounds within elements of the intelligence community , then leaked into the media . Nunes erred by briefing the White House on this information before his committee colleagues , for which he has apologized . One can also easily argue that he should n't have briefed the president at all -- after all , he leads a Congressional body that is conducting an active investigation that involves various figures in Trump 's orbit . Nevertheless , the substance of what he revealed raises more questions about the nature of the ongoing drumbeat of national security leaks , many of which seem designed to damage Trump 's presidency . On the same day of Nunes ' revelation , his Democratic counterpart declared the existence of evidence pointing to Trumpworld coordination with the Russians , beyond mere `` circumstantial '' conjecture :\n. @ RepAdamSchiff on Trump/Russia connection : `` There is more than circumstantial evidence now ... and is very much worthy of investigation . '' pic.twitter.com/qvw7drsqQX \u2014 Meet the Press ( @ MeetThePress ) March 22 , 2017\nOf course , that claim was advanced by the same man who recklessly repeated the endlessly-debunked yet widely-believed 'Moscow hacked the election ' conspiratorial lie earlier in the week :\nBut to what evidence was Rep. Schiff referring ? That remained , and remains , unclear . Soon thereafter , however , CNN dropped this alleged `` bombshell , '' which was breathlessly circulated by liberals who treated it as a smoking gun . Mentions of `` impeachment '' and `` treason '' whizzed around social media . But what did CNN 's big scoop actually demonstrate or prove ? Nothing . Matt ran through some of the details , but I thought this tweet was useful . Look at the number of weasel-word hedges here , even if you want to ignore the parting shot at the cable news network :\nThe report is about `` indications '' that `` associates '' ( what does that mean ? ) of Donald Trump had `` communicated '' ( in what capacity or context ? ) with `` suspected '' Russian officials ( suspected ? ) to `` possibly '' coordinate with the campaign . And all of this is attributed to nameless `` officials . '' Maybe the factual proof to back up the implications of this story truly does exist somewhere , which would be a genuine scandal . The FBI and relevant Congressional committees should continue their investigations into the matter . But to report such a provocative allegation based on such thin details does n't look like responsible journalism . It looks like a hit job . CNN 's report went on to concede that their anonymous sources could n't corroborate their central claims with `` conclusive '' evidence , and that the FBI is n't able to confirm it . Okay , so why report it , if not to add to a haze of controversy by amplifying unverified opinions ? I 'm not willing to categorically say that no collusion took place because I do n't know that to be true .
