The inspectors general , as executive-branch officers with a conduit to Congress , were a remaining check , albeit a weaker one . This no longer seems true\u2026 \u201c Voters can decide to eject a lawless president from office\u2014but only every four years , and even then only after a first term : A second-term president would find himself without any accountability at all . It is almost impossible to reconcile this vision with the checks and balances laid out by the Founders , but what the Trump administration has found is , there \u2019 s no need to reconcile it . All it has to do is enact it. \u201d David A. Graham , The Atlantic\n\u201c Many of the IGs who oversee 73 federal agencies probably aren \u2019 t very popular with their colleagues\u2026 Government workers complain about nitpicking and prolonged reviews . A summons to the IG \u2019 s office can be an invitation to months of scrutiny and potential recrimination . But most public servants accept that this intrusive scrutiny comes with the job of spending the public \u2019 s money\u2026 \u201c Linick has usefully annoyed State Department officials through two administrations . In December 2013 , the year he was appointed , he issued a \u2018 management alert \u2019 about cybersecurity breaches that roiled State Department officials but proved to be prescient . In June 2015 , to the everlasting regret of former secretary Hillary Clinton , he began investigating \u2018 hundreds of potentially classified emails \u2019 that had been on Clinton \u2019 s private email server\u2026 An IG \u2019 s job is to be meddlesome\u2026 The United States isn \u2019 t a family business . It \u2019 s a multi-trillion-dollar global operation . It needs independent auditors. \u201d David Ignatius , Washington Post\n\u201c The purge makes a mockery of Congress \u2019 s attempt to protect the independence of inspectors general , including a legal requirement that they not be removed without written [ justification ] . In the case of Mr. Linick , Mr. Trump dispatched a vague letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D-Calif. ) saying he \u2018 no longer \u2019 had \u2018 the fullest confidence \u2019 in the IG ... \u201c But Mr. Pompeo did not hesitate to blurt out the real reason Monday : Mr. Linick was not doing his bidding . He \u2018 wasn \u2019 t performing a function in a way that we had tried to get him to , \u2019 Mr. Pompeo said in an interview . But it is not the inspector general \u2019 s job to do what the secretary of state demands \u2014 especially when it comes to investigating his own behavior. \u201d Editorial Board , Washington Post\n\u201c The Inspector General Act of 1978 says that the head of the department ( Pompeo , in Linick 's case ) \u2018 shall not prevent or prohibit the [ IG ] from initiating , carrying out , or completing any audit or investigation. \u2019 We do n't know specifically if Linick was fired because of this investigation\u2026 but a State Department source confirmed that Pompeo made the recommendation for Linick to be removed\u2026 \u201c The Inspector General Act of 1987 and other related legislation lay out the IG 's responsibility and mandate : to prevent waste , fraud and abuse within the government 's bureaucracy -- independently and objectively . The President 's attempts to sideline or silence IGs who are fulfilling these responsibilities will only support the politicization of our federal government and prop up officials who accede to pressure and turn a blind eye to wrongdoing. \u201d Samantha Vinograd , CNN\n\u201c The [ arms ] sales were linked to discussions the administration had with Raytheon , the defense contractor which heavily lobbied for the arms sales , according to The New York Times . Congress had blocked the sales after bomb fragments traced to the contractor were linked to Saudi bombings that killed civilians and children . Democrats also questioned the potential conflicts of interest of a State Department official involved in the deal who had previously worked as a lobbyist for Raytheon . But the deal drew criticism from both sides of the aisle in Congress , where even Republicans called the move \u2018 unfortunate. \u2019 \u201d Igor Derysh , Salon\n\u201c Asked what specifically Linick was doing that he thought warranted his dismissal , the president said , \u2018 I don \u2019 t know . I don \u2019 t know anything about him . I don \u2019 t know anything other than the State Department , and Mike in particular , I guess they were not happy with the job he \u2019 s doing or something \u2019 \u2026 Trump dodged a question about whether he thinks Pompeo asking for Linick \u2019 s firing amid an active investigation into himself creates a conflict of interest , saying , \u2018 I don \u2019 t think it sounds , like , that important \u2019 \u2026 \u201c Trump didn \u2019 t even try to hide that he doesn \u2019 t think there should be any oversight of his administration conducted by someone who isn \u2019 t personally loyal to him , nor does he think it \u2019 s wrong for government officials to stymie investigations into their own conduct by firing the investigators. \u201d Aaron Rupar , Vox\n\u201c I am not a fan of the institution of inspector general because it is constitutionally suspect , to say the least . An IG works in the executive branch , and is therefore subordinate to the president , yet reports to Congress . This is a hybrid that flouts separation-of-powers principles\u2026 it was inevitable that IG positions would be politicized . They are designed that way , and the party out of power has always relied on IGs as a vehicle for addling the White House\u2026\n\u201c It would be better to reserve judgment until we know what actually happened . It is possible that the president is engaged in a pattern of retaliation over the Russia investigation , his impeachment over the Ukraine kerfuffle , and criticism over his handling of the coronavirus emergency\u2026 Nevertheless , it is also true that the president \u2019 s capacity to govern has been damaged by heinous allegations that have turned out to be either baseless or greatly exaggerated ; from his perspective , IGs have contributed to that damage . \u201d\nSome argue , \u201c Presidents do have the authority to fire inspectors general and President Trump is not the first president to do so . However , he seems to be the first president to so blatantly fire three IGs for doing their jobs and a fourth in an attempt to avoid oversight of how relief funds are spent . President Trump was elected based on a promise to \u2018 drain the swamp , \u2019 but his actions since taking office have seemed as swampy as anything that previous occupants of the White House have done . \u201d\nDated But Relevant : During the Obama administration , \u201c Republicans in Congress used IGs to investigate all sorts of government waste and abuse . The work of inspectors general constitutes the backbone of reports like Federal Fumbles : Ways the federal government dropped the ball , a report which details $ 383 billion in wasteful and inefficient federal spending . If IG recommendations were followed each year , the country would net $ 50 billion in savings . A recent Congressional report found that every dollar spent on inspectors general returns more than $ 22 in potential savings\u2026\n\u201c Critically , it was the work of the Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction ( SIGAR ) that led to the infuriating revelations of the Afghanistan Papers , a trove of interviews with over 600 people with firsthand knowledge of the war , including generals , diplomats , aid workers , and Afghan officials detailing unconscionable lies , spin , and over a trillion dollars wasted with no strategy at all . All of this would have been lost to history without the work of the inspector general . \u201d\nOthers note that \u201c President Barack Obama did not nominate an inspector general for the State Department during his entire first term . In fact , the post was vacant for nearly four years . The last inspector general under President George W. Bush , Howard J. Krongard , resigned in December 2007 . The position was vacant for nearly six years until the Senate confirmed Linick in September 2013\u2026 When Republicans raised questions about the vacancy , their concerns were dismissed . The Obama administration and [ Secretary of State Hillary ] Clinton herself defended the performance of the acting inspector general . \u201d\n\u201c House Democrats may want to hold their fire and take a look at a report which appeared in The Washington Post on Monday\u2026 Brian Bulatao , the State Department \u2019 s undersecretary for management , told The Post that Linick had been fired due to an alleged \u2018 pattern of unauthorized disclosures , or leaks to the news media about investigations that were in an early draft form. \u2019 According to The Post , Bulatao said that \u2018 officials had no evidence Linick was personally responsible for the leaks but that the disclosures had the potential of tainting the outcome of ongoing probes \u2019 \u2026\n\u201c Bulatao said the matter first arose last fall after media reports about an ongoing investigation that cited \u2018 two government sources involved in carrying out the investigation . You know the IG is normally charged with carrying out the investigation . It certainly was a very strong finger-pointing at IG Linick \u2019 s way. \u2019 Bulatao [ further ] told The Post that \u2018 Linick had ignored the directions of then-deputy secretary of state John Sullivan to refer the leak investigation to the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency so that an inspector general from another agency could be appointed to look into it . \u2019 \u201d",
