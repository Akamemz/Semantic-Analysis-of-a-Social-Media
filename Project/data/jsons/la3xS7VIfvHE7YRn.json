The lack of clarity just makes it harder for people to decide which signals from Washington and the media to follow \u2014 the ones telling them to freak out , or the ones telling them not to ? \u201d Jon Healey , Los Angeles Times\nOthers , however , point out that \u201c Before [ last week \u2019 s ] rate cut , the Fed only had around 1.5 percent [ of ammunition ] , leaving far less room to cut [ than in 2000 ] . And the Fed \u2019 s counterparts abroad are in even worse shape : short-term interest rates in Europe are actually negative , so the European Central Bank has basically no room at all to cut further\u2026 When it comes to the underlying economics , we know two things . First , the coronavirus is looking more and more like a serious blow to the economy . Second\u2026 the Fed and its counterparts don \u2019 t have much room to respond . I \u2019 ve been saying for a while that I didn \u2019 t know when the economy would next face a serious bump in the road , but I did know that our shock absorbers were pretty much shot . Well , here comes the bump . Brace yourself. \u201d Paul Krugman , New York Times\n\u201c Many observers have emphasized the adverse impact of the virus on supply ( especially in the global chains that play such a crucial role in manufacturing ) . The shock obviously has a supply element . But it seems clear that much of the impact of the virus is in the form of uncertainty , as households and businesses struggle with the question of where the disease will hit next , and how bad it will be when it does hit . This uncertainty is a drag on demand in the many communities throughout the country and world that have no cases of the virus . But that drag can be offset , as usual , by stimulus from the Fed and other policy makers \u2026 \u201c Given the demand nature of the shock , the Fed can and should do more when it meets again in a couple of weeks\u2026 [ And ] Congress has to step up to show its willingness to systematically insulate the economy against aggregate demand shocks by , for example , using a combination of tax cuts and increases in infrastructure spending . Without a much clearer strategic commitment to fiscal policy support of the economy , we can expect further declines in long-run expectations about growth and inflation \u2014 and that will make the current aggregate demand shortfall even worse. \u201d Narayana Kocherlakota , Bloomberg\n\u201c Silicon Valley \u2019 s top investing firm has a stark message on coronavirus : prepare for the worst\u2026 Calling coronavirus \u2018 the black swan of 2020 , \u2019 Sequoia predicted that the global economy could be dislodged by the virus , and the firm told its portfolio companies , \u2018 We suggest you question every assumption about your business \u2019 \u2026 Specifically , Sequoia is telling its founders to question how much cash it has before running out of money \u2018 to avoid potentially painful future consequences. \u2019 \u201d Theodore Schleifer , Vox\n\u201c [ The International Air Transport Association ] is now predicting that , globally , [ airline ] carriers will lose between $ 63 billion and $ 113 billion in passenger revenue this year\u2026 declines in travel are a pretty reliable leading indicator that a downturn is on the way .
