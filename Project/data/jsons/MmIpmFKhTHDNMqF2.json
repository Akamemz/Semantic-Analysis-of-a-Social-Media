Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia said the weather would \u201c throw havoc \u201d into the race , and Republican pollster Whit Ayres said it might be enough to change its course .\n\u201c Anything could be significant in races that are this tight , \u201d said Ayres , who isn \u2019 t affiliated with either campaign .\nHurricane Sandy is on track to hit the Eastern seaboard later today and merge with two strong winter storms to create what federal officials called a potentially life-threatening hybrid superstorm .
