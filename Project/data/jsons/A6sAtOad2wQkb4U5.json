No one understands the story the same way\n\nFor example, although the ambassador said that eventually, it became clear to him that Ukrainian commitments were the key that would unlock a meeting with Trump and \u2014 eventually, roughly $391 million in U.S. assistance \u2014 Sondland also said he didn't realize the target was former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nOnly within the past few months, when evidence emerged including the White House record of Trump's phone call on July 25 with Zelenskiy, did Sondland tie the phrase often used, \"Burisma,\" which is a reference to the Ukrainian company that paid Hunter Biden, to Trump and the election.\n\n\"It was always 'Burisma' to me, and I didn't know about the connection between Burisma and Biden,\" he said.\n\n2. There are credibility questions\n\nImpeachment inquisitors in both parties were dubious about that claim and other aspects of Sondland's testimony.\n\nThe ambassador said that he's \"not a note-taker\" and that he often relies on others' records.\n\nSondland already has revised the deposition he gave behind closed doors in an earlier phase of this inquiry, and questioners on Wednesday pressed him about what he called gaps in his recollection or whether he was stating a fact or making an inference.\n\nBut Sondland also said the White House and the State Department won't release some documents and other materials to his attorneys \u2014 a theme that chimed with Democrats' complaint about what they've called obstruction by Trump.\n\nOne question raised Wednesday was whether the hearing would move the needle with the Trump administration and prompt it to begin releasing records related to Sondland or other witnesses in the impeachment case.\n\n3.
