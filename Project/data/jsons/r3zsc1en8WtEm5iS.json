He knocks over the bowl , and his Cheetos spill on the floor . The man throws his head back in operatic despair and raises his hands to heaven as two words appear on the screen :\nYep , thanks President Obama . You ran for office vowing to unite us , but instead you gave us race-baiting , race riots and Black Lives Matter . You turned the promise of a post-racial era into one of the most racial periods in American history .\nWhat 's going to happen to those demons , though , once Obama leaves office ? Will racial tensions ease once his term ends ? Or is racial strife the new normal ?\nA recent CNN and Kaiser Family Foundation poll could point to an answer . The survey asked people from various ethnic groups about their impression of race relations , and their answers do n't offer much in the way of hope or change .\nMost Americans told the CNN/KFF poll that racial strife is getting worse . When asked whether tensions between racial and ethnic groups have increased during the past decade , 64 % said yes , as did a majority of whites ( 67 % ) , blacks ( 65 % ) and Latinos ( 55 % ) .\nAll those numbers are up significantly from April 2001 , when only 29 % of Americans said tensions had worsened over the previous 10 years . They 're also significantly higher than in the wake of the Million Man March in 1995 , when 47 % thought tensions had increased .\nBut when some of this year 's respondents and other observers were asked in follow-up interviews about the source of this surge in racial tension , their answers were as splintered as the nation 's electorate .\nConsider the question of whether racial strife is now the norm .\n`` I do n't see that stopping when Obama is no longer president , '' says Steve Sailer , who writes for Unz Review and Taki 's Magazine , both started by alumni of The American Conservative . `` I can imagine a white president like Hillary [ Clinton ] upping the ante because she does n't have the benefit of being black . ''\nSailer says Clinton will need to talk more about racial grievances to attract minority voters because she ca n't count on the strong black support that Obama enjoyed .\nDemocrats , he says , have decided to build a coalition of `` fringe '' groups by demonizing people who `` have rightful reasons for representing the core of Middle America . ''\nThat decision , however , is sparking a white backlash , Sailer warns . More whites are starting to see the need to unite like other ethnic groups .\n`` It 's become more acceptable for people to insult whites , especially white men , '' he says . `` You 're seeing more and more whites starting to develop a certain amount of white identity . ''\nPersistent racial tension , though , may actually be good for America , another writer suggests .\n`` We are confronting issues instead of walking around in a kind of phony peace , '' Bailey says . `` That 's not a bad thing . ''\nThen there is the question of blame . How much responsibility for increased racial tension rests with Obama ? Could he have done anything at the beginning of his first term to reduce them ? The answers are also varied .\nFor starters , a previous poll found that in 2011 -- well into Obama 's first term -- only 28 % of Americans felt that racism was a big problem , compared with 49 % in the 2015 CNN/KFF poll .\nAlso , social media , online comments and access to smartphone cameras have grown tremendously since Obama was first elected .\nAccusations that police use excessive force against African-Americans , for example , now can get far more attention -- far more quickly -- than ever .\nEduardo Bonilla-Silva , a professor of sociology at Duke University , calls it part of the `` new racism . ''\nCommunities of color across the country can more easily connect , according to Bonilla-Silva , and people are picking up on patterns that scholars have long discussed .\n`` People are doing Sociology 101 . They can connect Walter Scott , the assassinations of black folks in a church , the slamming of a girl in a school , '' he says . `` And then it 's across the nation . People are then connecting the dots and saying , 'No more . ' ``\nObama ran as someone who could transcend the nation 's racial divisions , many people interviewed for this story said . He declared during his keynote address at the 2004 Democratic Convention , `` There is not a liberal America and a conservative America . There is a United States of America . ''\nAnd during his 2008 speech on race in Philadelphia , he said , `` Working together we can move beyond some of our old racial wounds , and that in fact we have no choice if we are to continue on the path of a more perfect union . ''\nWhen , though , was the last time you heard someone seriously talk about the onset of a `` post-racial America '' ? For some people , revisiting that term is like unearthing love letters they wrote as a teenager : embarrassing .\nThe letdown over the post-racial promise many hoped Obama 's election would bring was memorably captured in an open letter Beth Reinhard wrote for the National Journal in 2013 under the headline , `` Barack Obama : A Divider , not a Uniter . '' She wrote :\nWe thought you were different , but you turned out to be like all the others . You promised hope and change ... but the red states and blue states are farther apart than ever . ...

MUST WATCH 11 years of President Obama discussing race 03:10\nOne poll respondent did n't have his heart broken because he never believed in Obama in the first place .\nRobert Randall , who lives in Hillsborough , North Carolina , said in the CNN/KFF poll that racial tension had increased during the past decade . When asked why , he blamed it on Obama .\nRandall , 68 , ticked off the reasons : Obama did nothing when Black Panther Party members intimidated voters at a polling station during the 2008 election ; he sent an entourage to the funeral of Michael Brown -- a black man whose death in Ferguson , Missouri , sparked protests in 2014 -- but sent no one to the funeral of a U.S. Army recruiter shot to death in Arkansas five years earlier ; and he took the side of a black Ivy League professor , Henry Louis Gates , who was arrested in his home by a white police office , before getting the facts .\n`` He shows sympathy toward blacks , '' Randall , who is white , says of Obama . `` He 's done that in several instances . He whines about you do n't know what it 's like to be black . ''\nRandall says the character of Americans has eroded under Obama . He says no one in his family got divorced and everyone worked hard when he was growing up . Randall put himself through college by working in a textile mill . But under Obama , he says , the government wants to tax corporations and the wealthy to support social programs that coddle the moochers .\n`` When you introduce socialism in this country , it sends a message that you can take money from the hard-working people and give it to the slackers , '' he says .\nNew Jersey Gov . Chris Christie , who 's running for the GOP presidential nomination , also recently blamed Obama for a worsening racial divide .\n`` I do n't think anyone can look objectively at where we sit as a country now and say that we 're better off than we were seven years ago on the issue of race in America with Barack Obama as president , '' Christie told CNN 's Jake Tapper on `` The Lead . '' `` In fact , I think he 's made it worse . ''\nChristie also said Obama has not succeeded in his promise to bring the country together , something Obama campaigned on in 2008 .\n`` We all had great hope , all of us , even those who did n't vote for him -- and I did n't -- in 2008 , had great hope that the first African-American president would help to heal some of the divides that we have racially in this country . ''\nA New York scholar and activist , though , says blaming Obama for a rise in racial venom is ludicrous because he 's been the primary target .\nMark Naison , a professor of history and African-American studies at Fordham University , says some whites are angry because their portion of the country 's population is shrinking . As the country gets browner , they get angrier .\n`` They think this is their country , and they 're really special , '' Naison says . `` These tensions are going to get worse . We 're stumbling toward being a more multiracial society with everyone 's culture respected and everyone having a shot at leadership . ''\nNaison says he 's not surprised by the surge in racial tension . He saw signs of it while campaigning for Obama in 2008 .\n`` I 'm never surprised at the depth of racism in America , '' he says . `` The depths of it are limitless . There is a well you can dig into if you are white that justifies almost any level of abuse that you can direct at a black person that challenges your comfort zone . ''\nObama , though , could have diffused some of the racial tension during his presidency by reaching out more aggressively to working-class whites , Naison says .\nHe made a tactical error when he decided to create a new health care program early in his first term when Democrats controlled Congress . It was at the height of the Great Recession , and although Obama enacted the economic stimulus program , Naison says Obama should have done more -- by following the example of Franklin Delano Roosevelt , who came into the Oval Office amid the Great Depression emphasizing massive government works programs that created jobs .\n`` That was his one chance to win over the low- and moderate-income whites that are deeply suspicious of him , '' Naison says . `` He could have won over whites with a New Deal jobs program rather than a health care act . ''\nBailey , the author , says Obama could have reduced racial animosity by doing something even more personal .\n`` If Obama really wanted to tackle it head-on , I think he should start , not in places like Ferguson , but in places like Kentucky and among the white people most afraid of what he represents , '' Bailey says . `` And I do n't mean go there and lecture to them , but to go and listen -- even if they are angry and call him names . They need to vent their frustration and know that they need to be heard . ''\nStill , there was some optimism buried in the interviews following the CNN/KFF survey .\nOne respondent who lives in Vermont , one of the whitest states in the nation , agreed that racial tension had increased in the past decade . Sean , who preferred to be identified only by his first name , blames the increase on social media and simple racism -- not Obama .\nSean talked with a self-awareness about race that seemed remarkable for his 27 years . He says he is Brazilian by heritage but looks white . Because of his Anglo appearance , he says , he often overhears racist remarks that pop up during casual conversations with whites .\n`` I do n't actually experience racial discrimination , '' Sean says . `` I recognize that I experience a level of comfort and privilege that some of my friends [ of color ] do n't experience . I never once had to think twice about putting on a hood when it 's cold , but I have a [ black ] friend who has . ''\nEmpathy , though , will only go so far in easing the racial tensions of the Obama era because they go beyond having a black man in the Oval Office , says Paul Street , an author and historian who has written several books about Obama and his time in office , including `` They Rule : The 1 % v . Democracy . ''\n`` A lot of what drives bad race relations is scarcity in the working-class populations , '' he says . `` We have all of these looming questions with globalization and downsizing . These are underlying structural problems . ''\nWhile some complain Obama has n't reached out enough to whites , others say he has n't done much for blacks either .\n`` Because of his skin color , '' Street says , `` he has been reluctant more than any other Democratic president in recent memory to talk about racism and to advance race-specific policies that help poor black people . ''\nIf Hillary Clinton wins the presidency , Street says the `` hate machine '' likely will switch targets .\n`` The identity politics will probably shift from race to gender , '' he says .\nAnd if someone else wins in 2016 , Fordham 's Naison suggests that the racial demons that stalked Obama 's presidency may even get worse .\n`` If you think there 's racial tension now , '' he says , `` wait until Donald Trump is elected .
