Ignore them .\nFirst , you wo n't be surprised with the results ( hint : It was a toss-up between Harvard , Yale and Princeton for the top spot ) . Second , these rankings exhibit a callous disregard for college affordability , prioritizing schools that spend more money on flashy amenities rather than scholarships and grants . Third , the magazine glamorizes selectivity , which creates a culture of exclusion that shuns low-income students the hardest .\nOver the past 30 years , college tuition increased by roughly 1,120 percent and the gap between high- and low-income kids with access to it has widened - from 31 percent to 45 percent . With college students ' biggest worry being their student loan debt , one would think that affordability would factor into U.S. News and World Report 's ranking formula . You would be wrong . Not only are they not considered , but often the ranking methods actually encourage higher college spending in other , less needed areas .\nTake a look at what Harvard University promotes on the first page of its college admissions brochure : \u201c You can fit a football field in the clean room of the Laboratory for Integrated Science and Engineering. \u201d While a school 's resources are important , the fact that Harvard University takes the time to detail the vast expanse of its amenities ( 70 individual libraries , a 3,000 acre forest research station , 12 teaching museums , a 265-acre arboretum making up just some of them , in case you were wondering ) in the first few pages of its brochure shows just how significant they are to a college 's image . What brochures do n't tell you is that these extensive amenities are covered by the rising college tuition . This is especially true for public universities , where tuition covers nearly half of their revenue .\nThe dependence on tuition \u2013 and the pressure for fancy amenities \u2013 comes at the price of lower-income families , as only 14 percent of students at the country 's most competitive colleges come from the lower 50 percent of families by income . Despite many top universities ' supposed dedication to diversifying , this disturbing percentage has not changed over the past two decades . Not surprisingly , this bias , however , is noted nowhere in U.S. News and World Report 's national ranking system , which does not evaluate a college 's affordability .\nWhat the report does account for is \u201c student selectivity , \u201d which makes up 12.5 percent of a college 's overall ranking . This factor relies heavily ( 65 percent ) on enrollees ' SAT and ACT scores ( tests already notorious for favoring affluent families and showing no proof of predicting college success ) as well as high school standing and the ratio of students admitted to applicants . In essence , we now have a system where colleges boast openly about excluding the masses -- a perverse marketing strategy to say the least .
