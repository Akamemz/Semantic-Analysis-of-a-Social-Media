The settlements are considered illegal under international law , although Israel disputes this .\nSpeaking on Tuesday , he said it was `` impossible for any Palestinian , Arab , Muslim or Christian child to accept '' a Palestinian state without Jerusalem as its capital .\n`` We say a thousand times , no , no , no , '' he said . `` We rejected this deal from the start and our stance was correct . ''\nThe militant Palestinian Islamist group Hamas , which controls the Gaza Strip , also rejected the deal which it said aimed `` to liquidate the Palestinian national project '' .\nThe UN said it remained committed to a two-state solution based on the boundaries in place before the 1967 war , when Israel seized the West Bank and Gaza .\nThe Israeli prime minister described Mr Trump 's plan as the `` deal of the century '' .\n`` May God bless us all with security , prosperity and peace !

Although the two sides signed a peace accord in 1993, more than a quarter of a century on they are arguably as far apart as ever.\n\nJerusalem: Both Israel and the Palestinians hold competing claims to the city. Israel, which occupied the formerly Jordanian-held eastern part in 1967, regards the whole of Jerusalem as its capital.
