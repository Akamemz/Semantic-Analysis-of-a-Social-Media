Chris Murphy ( D-Conn. ) and fellow Senate Democrats officially relinquished the floor early Thursday morning after spending nearly 15 hours straight talking about gun control , paving the way for high-profile congressional votes on restricting firearms just days after the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history .\nDespite the flurry of activity , though , the two sides appeared no closer to an agreement on gun legislation that can pass the Senate .\nStill , the chamber is likely to vote on two Democratic-backed gun measures : a proposal from Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D-Calif. ) meant to bar those on federal terror watch lists from obtaining firearms , and a plan from Murphy and Sens . Cory Booker ( D-N.J. ) and Chuck Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) mandating background checks for sales at gun shows and over the internet . Republicans are expected to put forward two of their own proposals for votes .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve gotten to a place where we \u2019 re going to get votes on these important amendments , \u201d Murphy , who had led the rhetorical charge on the Senate floor , said shortly before 1:30 a.m. Thursday . \u201c What would \u2019 ve been unacceptable is to spend this entire week on legislative business that was irrelevant to the epidemic of gun violence that has been made more real than ever . \u201d\nThe Connecticut senator , who had been a leading gun-control advocate in the Senate since the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 , took to the floor at 11:21 a.m. Wednesday to draw attention to the Democrats \u2019 latest push to crack down on firearms laws . But it was a caucus-wide effort \u2014 38 other Senate Democrats joined Murphy in the filibuster that lasted 14 hours and 50 minutes , with a handful of lawmakers , including Booker and Sen. Richard Blumenthal ( D-Conn. ) , standing with Murphy for hours on end .\nMurphy formally yielded at 2:11 a.m. Thursday after delivering an emotional tribute to two Sandy Hook victims : 6-year-old Dylan Hockley and a teacher \u2019 s aide , Anne Marie Murphy , who was fatally shot while trying to shield Hockley from bullets .\n\u201c It doesn \u2019 t take courage to stand here on the floor of the United States Senate for two hours or six hours or 14 hours , \u201d Murphy said . \u201c It takes courage to look into the eye of a shooter and instead of running , wrapping your arms around a 6-year-old boy and accepting death . ''\nThe senator continued : \u201c If Anne Marie Murphy could do that , then ask yourself : What can you do to make sure that Orlando or Sandy Hook never , ever happens again ? \u201d\nAs Murphy and other Senate Democrats talked all day Wednesday , however , bipartisan negotiations on gun legislation were breaking down behind closed doors .\nIn an election year , even something that seems politically unassailable \u2014 such as barring potential terrorists from getting weapons \u2014 is proving to be an incredibly difficult task . While senators in both parties say they want a solution , the Democrats \u2019 attention-grabbing filibuster may be remembered more vividly than sputtering negotiations aimed at finding a compromise to close the so-called terrorist gun loophole .\n\u201c I \u2019 m not looking for cover ; I \u2019 m looking to get something done here , \u201d said Sen. Pat Toomey ( R-Pa. ) , who was speaking with the pro-gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety about a potential compromise . But Democrats have already rejected that proposal as worse than previous Republican offerings .\nAt first blush , the Senate on Wednesday seemed ready to take action to try to prevent future killings like last weekend \u2019 s massacre of 49 people in Orlando . Even as Democrats planned their lengthy filibuster , Republicans batted around anti-terrorism proposals and both parties were briefed by FBI Director James Comey .\nBut aides in both parties said there was little real movement by the end of the day , and both sides remained dug in behind their previous positions . Republicans and Democrats developed anti-terror guns proposals in December after the mass shooting in San Bernardino , Calif. \u2014 and one senior Democratic source said it would be a breakthrough simply to get re-dos on those two failed votes .\n\u201c My guess is we \u2019 re back to square one , \u201d the source said .\nThe day began in earnest when Murphy launched a talking filibuster on the Senate floor \u2014 which was quickly joined by fellow Democrats \u2014 in an effort to pressure Republicans to accept legislation that would deny suspected terrorists from purchasing firearms and require universal background checks .\nThe Senate is debating a spending bill for the Justice Department , to which Democrats had pushed to offer gun amendments .\n\u201c I \u2019 m going to remain on this floor until we get some signal , some sign that we can come together on these two measures , that we can get a path forward on addressing this epidemic in a meaningful , bipartisan way , \u201d Murphy said as he launched his filibuster .\nMost of the Democratic Caucus was unaware of Murphy \u2019 s plans until he took the floor , two senior aides said , though there had been some talk Tuesday about lining up speeches throughout the night Wednesday .\nAt the same time , Sens . John Cornyn ( R-Texas ) and Feinstein explored whether there was common ground on preventing suspected terrorists from buying firearms . Currently , the two parties are backing very different approaches to resolving instances in which someone feels they \u2019 ve been wrongly put on a watch list and therefore can not purchase a gun .\nTalks to reconcile those different approaches began on Tuesday , and Cornyn dismissed the Democratic filibuster as \u201c filling the dead air \u201d while the two parties negotiate .\n\u201c This is a lot more nuanced than some people appreciate , \u201d Cornyn said in an interview . \u201c We \u2019 re trying . \u201d\nLate Wednesday afternoon , however , Feinstein signaled that her talks with Cornyn were unlikely to bear fruit .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think that \u2019 s gon na work out , \u201d Feinstein told reporters . When asked why , she responded : \u201c I was told he gave it to the NRA . Now , that would do it . \u201d\nSeparately , Toomey was working with the Michael Bloomberg-backed group Everytown on a bipartisan deal to end the loophole . Democrats seemed unmoved , but Toomey vowed to push on : \u201c I don \u2019 t think you can assume all Democrats have \u201d rejected the proposal , he said in a brief interview , although Everytown said in a statement it couldn \u2019 t yet endorse his bill .\nMurphy and the Senate Democrats \u2019 talk-a-thon marked an unusual day in the Senate , which had taken up the spending bill for DOJ , the Commerce Department and related agencies .
