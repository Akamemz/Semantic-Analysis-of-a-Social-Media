    "content": "President Donald Trump 's allies in the House say they are confident of minimal GOP defections Tuesday on a vote to roll back his declaration of a national emergency to siphon billions of dollars from the military to fund his proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border .\nThe Democratic-controlled chamber is expected to approve the measure and send it to the Republican-held Senate , where it would take only a handful of GOP defections to pass . The legislation would revoke Trump 's executive order declaring an emergency so he could use other federal funding to pay for his wall .\nWith three Senate Republicans saying they will support the legislation , only one more was needed to vote with all the Democrats to pass the measure and send it to Trump .\nTrump is sure to prevail in the end since he could use his first-ever veto to kill the measure , but the White House is seeking to minimize defections among the president 's GOP allies to avoid embarrassment .\n`` When you see the vote today there will be nowhere near the votes to override a veto , '' said House GOP Whip Steve Scalise , R-La .\nEven many GOP lawmakers who view themselves as protectors of Congress ' power of the purse say they are deferring to Trump in this case , saying he has the authority under a mid-1970s statute .\n`` They love Trump in my district , '' said Rep. Billy Long , R-Mo . `` I 'm for Trump . ''\nDemocratic leaders say the vote is not about the merits of Trump 's wall but how Trump is trampling on the Constitution by grabbing money that he ca n't obtain through normal means .\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Trump 's action `` steals billions of dollars '' from the military construction projects\u2014 including possibly family housing and child care centers \u2014 to build the wall with Mexico .\nRepublicans counter that problems with drug runners and human trafficking give merit to Trump 's maneuver .\n`` I went down there neutral on this question . Did n't know whether or not I 'd support a national emergency , '' said Rep. Adam Kinzinger , R-Ill. , who recently returned from a National Guard deployment along the border in Arizona . `` And I came back more convinced than probably anybody that this is the right thing to do . ''\n`` If Republicans vote their beliefs , we 'll get a lot .
