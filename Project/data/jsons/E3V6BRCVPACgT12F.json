They \u2019 re so much more helpful than those sympathetic liberals at the Times , Atlantic Monthly , and NBC are .\n\u201c How We Destroy Lives Today. \u201d That \u2019 s the title of the column Mr. Brooks wrote after the Covington Boys affair . That \u201c We \u201d certainly pleased the pushy progressives . It was exactly what they wanted our respectable commentators to say . Only for a moment did Mr. Brooks blame identity politics journalists and race advocates for demonizing the boy in the MAGA cap . Soon enough , he rose above the messy skirmish , looked down like a Hegelian sage upon it , and pronounced a general condition that implicates us all .\n\u201c In this case the facts happened to support the right-wing tribe , \u201d Brooks admitted . \u201c But that \u2019 s not the point . The crucial thing is that the nation \u2019 s culture is now enmeshed in a new technology that we don \u2019 t yet know how to control . \u201d\nYou see , it \u2019 s the technology \u2019 s fault . And there \u2019 s another one of those universal \u201c we \u201d words . The furious denunciation of a teenager from Kentucky who merely stood still and smiled ( was he gloating ? was he nervous ? who cares ! ) became the latest fiend of the race-scolds , but the conservative columnist didn \u2019 t judge the action a customary tactic of left . No , Brooks and other prudent rightists don \u2019 t want to identify in the DNA of the left anything accusatory and polarizing . Cautious Conservatives don \u2019 t point fingers and name names . That \u2019 s not their style . The rancid identity politics of the left caused this episode , but let \u2019 s not get bogged down in specifics . The properly conservative mind doesn \u2019 t get caught up in squabbles . It digs below the racial surface of the white boy face-to-face with the Indian elder and uncovers a condition that crosses political groups . Here , the Cautious Conservative tells us , we have fallen into the habit of setting upon one another , and next time it may just as easily be the right going after an innocent citizen with righteous glee as it was the left this time .\nThe leftist nods with a happy smile , and thanks all the sober and circumspect conservatives who want to restore tolerance and civility to the public square . They are the best allies the left could find . To have their gross misjudgment of the Covington episode de-politicized in just this way leaves them free to do the same thing next time a propitious occasion arises . There is no cost to having failed in demonization this time . The Cautious Conservative has universalized the crime , spreading the blame for disharmony throughout the citizenry and maintaining the illusion that all of us want unity , or at least a more or less peaceful pluralism , or at the very least a country where we can all just get along .\nBut what about Brendan Eich , Mark Regnerus , Naomi Schaefer Riley , Larry Summers , Dan T. Cathy , Charles Murray , Tucker Carlson\u2026 . Each one became a target , sometimes a physical target , for expressing an opinion the left found abominable , even though a good portion of the American populace holds it , too .
