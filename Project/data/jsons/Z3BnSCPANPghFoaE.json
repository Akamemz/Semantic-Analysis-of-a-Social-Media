Reopen businesses or keep them closed ? Trust Dr. Anthony Fauci \u2019 s expertise \u2013 or not so much ?\nOn question after question , the debates have grown heated . Even amid a pandemic , when a sense of common purpose and shared values are essential , the nation \u2019 s red-blue divide seems as sharp as ever . In some circles , wearing a mask is now seen as a liberal political statement while going maskless is a sign of \u201c don \u2019 t tread on me \u201d defiance .\nIn Texas , the debate over a salon owner jailed for reopening her shop early became so intense that Lt. Gov . Dan Patrick paid her $ 7,000 fine and offered to serve the rest of her sentence under house arrest .\nEven the widely admired Dr. Fauci , the nation \u2019 s top epidemiologist , has not escaped the partisan buzzsaw . True , he enjoys strong support in both parties , but there \u2019 s still a 17-point partisan gap : 88 % Democratic approval versus 71 % among Republicans , according to Gallup .\nPolarization , building for decades , was already intense before COVID-19 . Now it \u2019 s on steroids \u2013 especially with a presidential election just six months away . And at a time when a shared reliance on facts and science is absolutely critical , partisanship and a deficit of trust have made fighting the virus all the more challenging .\n\u201c For 40 years , there \u2019 s been a growing anti-intellectualism or perhaps populist resentment toward the traditional sources of informational authority \u2013 the press , academia , the scientific community , nonpartisan government agencies , \u201d says David Barker , director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University in Washington . \u201c We \u2019 ve gotten to the point , egged on by the president for four years , where maybe one-third of the country just does not trust a single word they hear from any of the traditional sources . \u201d\nIt must be acknowledged that the \u201c traditional sources \u201d sometimes do get it wrong . The mainstream media make mistakes . In 2003 , the United States went to war in Iraq based on faulty intelligence over weapons of mass destruction .\nBut each side now has its own sources of information and its own perspective in interpreting that information \u2013 coupled with a healthy dose of distrust of the other side .\nOn COVID-19 , two-thirds of Americans don \u2019 t think the official U.S. death toll \u2013 76,600 as of Friday \u2013 is accurate , and faith in that figure is declining , according to the latest Axios-Ipsos poll . But partisans disagree on how it \u2019 s wrong : Among Democrats , 63 % say it \u2019 s an undercount , given that some people are dying with COVID-19-like symptoms without being tested . Among Republicans , on the other hand , a plurality ( 40 % ) says the figure is inflated . Some Republicans suspect the number is being overstated to hurt President Donald Trump .\n\u201c It just shows how sadly tribal we have become in our politics that we can \u2019 t even bring ourselves to accept the same set of facts , and feel compelled to question the motivations of our leaders and of each other , \u201d says Mo Elleithee , director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service and a former Democratic strategist .\nNewt Gingrich sees a partisan hostility born of \u201c deep differences in values , worldviews , goals , and definitions of reality , \u201d the former Republican House speaker writes in an email . \u201c The gap is now so large that each group sees its opponents as \u2018 the other . \u2019 \u201d\n\u201c When the governor of Minnesota keeps open Planned Parenthood but closes churches , he is communicating a value set utterly alien to religiously committed people , \u201d Speaker Gingrich continues .\nThe rural-urban geographic divide is also shaping perceptions of the crisis , with Democratic-leaning regions hit harder by the virus than Republican-leaning areas . People who live in cities and suburbs , where population density and demographics have so far produced the highest case loads , are literally experiencing the pandemic differently from those in rural areas .\nThat could soon shift : Coronavirus cases are now rising at a faster rate in rural America than in metropolitan areas , according to the Kaiser Family Foundation . The spread to rural , redder areas brings its own challenges , given their older populations , more preexisting health conditions , and fewer hospitals . Rural areas also face economic problems even when the national economy is strong .\nFriday \u2019 s jobs report \u2013 14.7 % of Americans unemployed in April , the highest level since the Great Depression \u2013 brought home the shocking economic impact of the virus .\nYet on the question of reopening businesses , partisan differences are again sharp , and vary depending on the type of business . Some 61 % of Republicans support opening golf courses , while only 30 % of Democrats agree , according to the latest Washington Post-University of Maryland poll .\nWith barber shops and hair salons , 48 % of Republicans support reopening versus 15 % of Democrats . Regarding movie theaters , the survey reports 33 % of Republicans support reopening versus 8 % of Democrats .\nThen there \u2019 s the mask question , which has become a flashpoint for partisan sniping . A majority in both parties say they wear a mask when leaving home , but Democrats are more likely to wear one by a margin of 17 percentage points \u2013 76 % to 59 % .\nWhen Vice President Mike Pence didn \u2019 t wear a mask on a visit last week to Minnesota \u2019 s Mayo Clinic , where mask usage is required , liberal outrage ensued . He said he didn \u2019 t feel the need to wear one , given he is regularly tested for COVID-19 , but later he said he should have .\nPresident Trump has yet to wear a mask in public . On April 3 , when the Centers for Disease Control changed its guidance and recommended that Americans wear masks when outside the home , the president said he preferred not to .\nHis actions may have swayed some Americans \u2019 actions . A March academic study shows that partisan affiliation \u2013 more than age , income , or education level \u2013 was a \u201c huge divider \u201d in people \u2019 s reported health behaviors , such as hand-washing and canceled trips , says Shana Kushner Gadarian , political scientist at Syracuse University and co-author of the study .\n\u201c People are taking their cues from political leadership and from doctors , and to the extent that those are different , people will turn to their more trusted sources , \u201d Professor Gadarian says .\nIn other words , mixed messages \u2013 say , on mask-wearing \u2013 may be producing a mix of behaviors .\nTake Danielle Zaccagnino , a 30-something teacher in suburban Alexandria , Virginia , who says she leans liberal and has largely stayed inside since the virus outbreak started . When she does go out , she wears an N95 mask . She avoids the news , and keeps up with events via friends and social media .\n\u201c The assumption is that liberals are more panicked and conservatives are not , \u201d Ms. Zaccagnino says . But \u201c because I limit my exposure to the conversation , I think that \u2019 s the main factor in how not panicked I am . \u201d\nIn contrast , Stephen Hunt , a 50-something project manager in information technology , says he goes out in public all the time and doesn \u2019 t wear a mask or gloves . He watches Fox News , and thinks the official death toll from COVID-19 is \u201c probably too high . \u201d\nMr. Hunt , who lives in exurban King George County , Virginia , says he identifies as \u201c conservative \u201d more than \u201c Republican , \u201d because the party has embraced big government . Most important , he says , he wants the freedom to make choices for himself and be treated by the government as an individual .\nThe virus , he says , \u201c hasn \u2019 t changed the way we [ he and his wife ] go about our normal day-to-day business at all , other than social distancing , which we abide by of course . \u201d\nYet beneath these apparent divisions , certain bedrock American values are still shining through .\n\u201c There \u2019 s plenty of evidence that on the ground , at the community level , we actually have become less polarized and have forged strong communities , \u201d says Mr. Elleithee , former communications director at the Democratic National Committee .\nHe cites stories of people delivering groceries to elderly neighbors and drives to help keep local businesses afloat .\nIn late March , the Next Door app added a feature that allows neighbors to help neighbors during the pandemic .
