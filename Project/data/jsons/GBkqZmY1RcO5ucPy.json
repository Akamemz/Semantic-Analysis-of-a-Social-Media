All it took was the adolescent agitprop of Donald Trump to lay bare the rift between the Party Establishment ( i.e . corporate donors ) and the Party Base , whose anxieties and prejudices they have been manipulating for decades .\nThere \u2019 s been a gleeful sense of schadenfreude in the coverage churned out by left-leaning outlets in particular . How lovely it has been to watch the conservative movement \u2019 s house of cards fall into shambles !\nThe problem , of course , is that Republicans aren \u2019 t the only party facing an historic rift . Over the past two weeks , it \u2019 s become increasingly obvious that grassroots liberals are thoroughly disgusted by their own party establishment .\nThe Republicans no doubt face a brutal convention , in which they must either nominate an unpopular candidate or incur the wrath of the masses by handpicking an establishment figure .\nBut the Democrats already face a kind of inverse dilemma . Barring a miracle , they will nominate an establishment candidate who is at best tepidly supported , and at worst reviled , by those who have rallied behind her insurgent foe , Bernie Sanders .\nRemember , the whole primary season is designed to consolidate support behind the frontrunner . At this point in the race , with only one opponent\u2014an elderly socialist from Vermont with a degree from the Larry David School of Charm \u2014 Clinton should be turning her attention to the general election .\nInstead , she \u2019 s lost eight of nine contests many by a wide margin , and is barely hanging on in her home state , where her opponent is drawing huge and ecstatic crowds .\nRight wing pundits\u2014a sad and desperate lot at the moment \u2014 eagerly compare Sanders to Trump . The idea here is that the widespread disgust with Washington \u2019 s dysfunction has opened the door to outsider demagogues who spout lurid promises .\nIn fact , Sanders and Trump have about as much in common as George Wallace and Eugene Debs . Sanders isn \u2019 t trying to sell steaks or live out some Reality TV fantasy . He entered politics from the tradition of social justice .\nThe reason he keeps beating Hillary Clinton is because a huge portion of the electorate\u2014particularly young voters\u2014is yearning for the kind of explicit social justice he \u2019 s prescribing . To put it bluntly : he \u2019 s articulating a moral vision , not an electoral path to the White House .\nAnd that , frankly , is what the Democratic Party used to do , back in the era of the New Deal and the Great Society . It offered as its essential pitch to voters a compassionate and responsive government that sought to combat \u2014 or at least mitigate \u2014 the corrosive values of a capitalist theocracy .\nWhat does the modern Democratic Party offer ? The strategy put forward by Bill Clinton was called \u201c triangulation. \u201d And while it may have worked in an electoral sense , the de facto result was a strategy of appeasement that left Democrats pushing conservative policies : welfare reform , tax cuts , financial deregulation .\nObama \u2019 s signature legislative achievement , the Affordable Care Act , is essentially the program Bob Dole proposed back in 1993 . His solution to our suicidal dependence on fossil fuels\u2014cap-and-trade\u2014is yet another recycled Republican idea .\nThe modern Democratic Party , in other words , has chosen to enable \u2014 and in many cases sponsor\u2014policies that have allowed capitalism to act like a giant centrifuge , concentrating wealth and power in the hands of the few to the detriment of the many .\nThis is why a majority of Democratic primary voters not only identify as liberal but believe that socialism has a ( gasp ! ) positive impact on society .\nThe underlying message of the Sanders campaign is that rank and file democrats no longer believe in capitalism as a guiding force in our economy or , especially , in our politics . And they are identifying mainstream Democrats \u2014 from Hillary Clinton to DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz\u2014as defenders of a status quo that amounts to crony capitalism .\nThe logic isn \u2019 t terribly subtle .
