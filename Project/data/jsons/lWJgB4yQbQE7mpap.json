The allegation is that Kavanaugh and a friend locked a girl in a room at a party when he was 17-years-old .\nOh my god .

Seems legit . ? ? \u2014 Guy Benson ( @ guypbenson ) September 13 , 2018\nSome Democrat was bound to have something . Mr. Kavanaugh had come through his confirmation hearing last week without a dent , and Democrats had made themselves look bad by editing his quotes and spreading innuendo unrelated to his judicial views . Meanwhile , the political left is demanding that Democrats do something , anything , to stop the highly qualified jurist from joining the High Court . Enter DiFi . \u201c I have received information from an individual concerning the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court , \u201d Ms. Feinstein said in a statement . \u201c That individual strongly requested confidentiality , declined to come forward or press the matter further , and I have honored that decision . I have , however , referred the matter to federal investigative authorities. \u201d Ms. Feinstein offered no details , and Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley said Thursday that she didn \u2019 t share the information with him . News reports say the information refers to a letter from a woman concerning possible sexual misconduct when she and Mr. Kavanaugh were both in high school . That would have been sometime in the early 1980s . News reports also say that Ms. Feinstein has had the letter since the summer , and that it was first sent to the office of Rep. Anna Eshoo , a Democrat from Silicon Valley . But if the \u201c information \u201d is worrying enough to send to the FBI , why did Sen. Feinstein wait so long ? She didn \u2019 t bring it up during the summer in the run-up to the hearings , didn \u2019 t mention it when she met with Judge Kavanaugh , and didn \u2019 t think it was important enough to tell her colleagues . The charitable explanation is that she didn \u2019 t think the information was credible enough to warrant investigation , but that now under pressure from her colleagues she felt obliged to surface it . [ \u2026 ] So here \u2019 s what we have : A story floated at the last minute about an accusation whose details are unknown from a woman whose identity is secret . The episode says more about the desperation of Democrats than it does about Mr. Kavanaugh , and the real disgrace would be if Republicans did anything other than move promptly to a confirmation vote .\nColumnist Kimberley Strassel commented on social media that this point , the secret letter from a secret person who alleges sexual misconduct , which was kept from the GOP , but wasn \u2019 t serious enough to bring to the FBI until now , is \u201c scary. \u201d It sounds very\u2026deep state , huh ?\n1 ) On Feinstein 's referral of a letter with an accusation against Kavanaugh to the FBI :\n-- This is impt enough to be sent to FBI , but not impt enough to have been raised before now ? Ca n't be both . NYT reports she got the letter this summer . \u2014 Kimberley Strassel ( @ KimStrassel ) September 13 , 2018\n-- similarly , this is impt enough to be sent to FBI , but never shared with a single Republican charged with advice and consent ?\n-- Feinstein statement explicitly acknowledges that the accuser did not want to take this further . So why is it with the FBI ? \u2014 Kimberley Strassel ( @ KimStrassel ) September 13 , 2018\n-- timing here can not be ignored . Coming only after Democrats were unable to further stall a vote .\n-- and just to be clear , Ds and media are now using a secret letter with a secret accusation from a secret person , to try to take down Kavanaugh . Scary . \u2014 Kimberley Strassel ( @ KimStrassel ) September 13 , 2018\nOh , and on top of this super secret letter crap , Democrats sent Kavanaugh over 1,000 additional questions , the most for any nominee combined in U.S. history . The game is over , Democrats . Again , you lost and we won :\nSenate Democrats submitted a record number of written questions to President Trump \u2019 s Supreme Court nominee , in a move Republicans said was the latest attempt to delay confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh . The 1,278 questions are four times more than the number asked of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch , Mr. Trump \u2019 s first high court pick , last year . Indeed , it \u2019 s more than the combined total for every justice in U.S. history , said Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley . [ \u2026 ] Nominees are usually given a week to answer the written questions , which are supposed to be clarifications and follow-ups to the questions the judge answered in person during last week \u2019 s confirmation hearing .\n1 ) This vague allegation is being circulated by people other than the woman in question , who has declined to comment . Its substance \u2014 categorically denied by Kavanaugh \u2014 covers a gray zone ranging from a sexually awkward encounter to an attempted assault when they were both 17 ... \u2014 Guy Benson ( @ guypbenson ) September 14 , 2018\n2 ) The alleged experience took place ~36 yrs ago . Even if you take it 100 % at face value , it might mean that a high school boy didn \u2019 t slam on the brakes while drunkenly making out & wanting more in 1982 . At worst , it was arguably attempted assault . Again , he denies it totally ... \u2014 Guy Benson ( @ guypbenson ) September 14 , 2018\n3 ) Let \u2019 s say it \u2019 s false . How can a 50-something successfully defend himself against this sort of hazy accusation-by-proxy about his sexual conduct in high school ? No matter what he & his allies ( including dozens of bipartisan women who knew him in HS ) say , it \u2019 s impossible ... \u2014 Guy Benson ( @ guypbenson ) September 14 , 2018\n4 ) You simply can \u2019 t prove a negative . That \u2019 s what makes this so tricky . And it \u2019 s especially hard to clear your name when so many people are invested in disbelieving you solely because of politics ... \u2014 Guy Benson ( @ guypbenson ) September 14 , 2018\n5 ) Let \u2019 s say it \u2019 s true . If someone is a predator , they likely don \u2019 t try something once , then never again . Are there any additional , credible , * specific * claims about BK along these lines ? With an accuser who will go on the record with evidence ? \u2014 Guy Benson ( @ guypbenson ) September 14 , 2018\n6 ) & isn \u2019 t it very possible the intent of \u201c forcing himself on her \u201d ( broad term ) was perceived quite differently by each party in the moment ? It may not have been actionable at the time , even if she \u2019 d instantly called the cops . How the hell are we supposed to adjucate that NOW ? \u2014 Guy Benson ( @ guypbenson ) September 14 , 2018\n7 ) As for the politics of this , Dems threw the kitchen sink at BK & whiffed . The timing of this is hugely suspect , especially since Feinstein reportedly had this letter 6-8 weeks ago . She never confronted BK with it during open or closed hearings .... \u2014 Guy Benson ( @ guypbenson ) September 14 , 2018\n8 ) If she thought it was credible and disqualifying , she should have \u2018 believed the victim \u2019 and raised it , rather than sitting on it for months & finally passing it off to the FBI , with leaks conveniently dripping out the week before a committee vote . C \u2019 mon ... \u2014 Guy Benson ( @ guypbenson ) September 14 , 2018\n9 ) Meanwhile , the same people declaring every lie , smear and tendentious attack against Kavanaugh to be a \u2018 bombshell \u2019 that somehow justifies postponing/defeating/delaying etc are doing the same thing here . It stinks because it \u2019 s so transparently rotten ... \u2014 Guy Benson ( @ guypbenson ) September 14 , 2018\n10 ) And points in Kavanaugh \u2019 s favor as his camp tries to push back vs. this decades-old vapor ( letter signed by 65 women , BK \u2019 s record of empowering women & being a good dad etc ) are being wielded AGAINST him as \u2018 proof \u2019 of his own desperation or compensation/contrition . It \u2019 s nuts . \u2014 Guy Benson ( @ guypbenson ) September 14 , 2018\n11 ) I \u2019 m open to evidence , but based on everything we know rn about this ( not a lot , frankly ) , about BK \u2019 s decades of public life ( quite a lot ) & the timing of this ambiguous , indirect accusation , it looks like a very ugly smear & 11th hour ploy from partisans ... \u2014 Guy Benson ( @ guypbenson ) September 14 , 2018\n12 ) Unless clear , add \u2019 l evidence emerges , this is awful , unfair & obviously designed to cast a shadow over the legitimacy/character of a nominee they can \u2019 t beat or stop on the merits . And we wring our hands about good ppl not wanting to subject themselves to public service ! Gee . \u2014 Guy Benson ( @ guypbenson ) September 14 , 2018\nAnd who says we 're not at a state of war with the Democrats ? Because with this , and a slew of other antics , we are .",
