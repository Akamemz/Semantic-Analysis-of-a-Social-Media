''\nThere is no war more just than this , '' he added .\nHamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri struck a defiant tone in response to Netanyahu 's warnings .\n`` His threats do not scare Hamas or the Palestinian people and the occupation will pay the price for the massacres against civilians and children , '' he said .\nEarlier Monday , Netanyahu blasted a United Nations Security Council statement calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza , telling U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that it recognizes the needs of a \u201c murderous terrorist organization , \u201d and not Israeli security .\nDuring a phone conversation with Ban , Netanyahu said the statement ignores Israel 's demands for the demilitarization of the Gaza Strip , a condition already established by previous interim agreements with the Palestinians , The Jerusalem Post reported .\n\u201c The statement did not deal with the harm done to Israeli civilians , nor to the fact that Hamas turned Gaza civilians into human shields , \u201d Netanyahu said . He also complained that the statement made no mention of the fact that Hamas used U.N. facilities to attack Israeli civilians .\nIsrael accepted a UN request for a humanitarian cease-fire three times , he said , while Hamas violated each one .\nIn New York Sunday , the U.N. Security Council adopted the presidential statement calling for an `` immediate and unconditional humanitarian cease-fire '' as Muslims began celebrating the Eid al-Fitr holiday marking the end of the fasting month of Ramadan .\nThe statement calls for both Israel and Hamas `` to accept and fully implement the humanitarian cease-fire into the Eid period and beyond . '' It said this would allow for the delivery of urgently needed assistance . It is the council 's strongest statement yet on the Gaza war , but it was not a resolution and therefore not binding .\nDrafted by Jordan , the Arab League 's representative on the Security Council , the statement \u2019 s text `` expresses grave concern regarding the deterioration in the situation as a result of the crisis related to Gaza and the loss of civilian lives and casualties , '' though it does not call for the Israeli military to pull out of the territory .\nNetanyahu recommended to Ban that that the international community \u201c work to demilitarize Gaza , \u201d instead of having its money used by Hamas to build terror tunnels to attack Israel .\n\u201c They are continuing to fire even now at Israel citizens , \u201d he said . \u201c Israel will continue to deal with the terror tunnels , which is only the first step in demilitarization . \u201d\nSecretary-General Ban reiterated the need for an immediate unconditional humanitarian ceasefireat the U.N. Monday .\n\u201c The people of Gaza have nowhere to run . They are trapped and besieged on a speck of land . Every area is a civilian area .

Israel has lost 52 soldiers , as well as two Israeli civilians and a Thai worker killed by rocket and mortar attacks from Gaza , according to the Israeli military .\nPalestinian U.N . Ambassador Riyad Mansour also criticized Monday \u2019 s U.N. statement , saying the council should have adopted a strong and legally binding resolution a long time ago demanding an immediate halt to Israel 's `` aggression , '' providing the Palestinian people with protection and lifting the siege in the Gaza Strip so goods and people can move freely .\nMansour also expressed hope that Israel will `` honor and respect '' a new humanitarian cease-fire , which the Palestinians hope will last `` for a long time '' so all outstanding issues can be addressed , especially the siege .\n`` You can not keep 1.8 million Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip in this huge prison , '' he told reporters . `` That is a recipe for disaster .
