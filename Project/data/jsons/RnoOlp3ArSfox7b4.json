    "content": "Now on his third chief of staff , he describes his change in management in sports terms , no longer picking the best overall athlete but whoever best fits the particular job . Burned by failed Roosevelt Room summits with Republican leaders and faced with implacable resistance , he has abandoned the inside game to barnstorm the country pressuring lawmakers . Once a virtual prime minister tethered to Congress , he now advances immigration , environmental and education initiatives through executive authority .\nIn the privacy of the West Wing , of course , there are moments when he feels discouraged by what he has not accomplished or unappreciated for what he has . \u201c That \u2019 s been our sweet spot \u2014 finding policies that don \u2019 t make anybody happy , that make both sides angry , \u201d he has joked , Mr. Goolsbee said . \u201c And the experts then say , well , they didn \u2019 t do enough anyway . \u201d\nBut those close to him say he takes the long view , understands things will not change as quickly as he likes , and retains his famed never-too-high , never-too-low reserve . During the dark days of summer 2011 when a grand bargain with Republicans on spending slipped away , he took a walk with David Axelrod , his strategist , to the White House basketball court and shot hoops .\n\u201c Do you ever rethink this , about whether it was worth doing ? \u201d Mr. Axelrod remembered asking .\nMr. Obama looked at him incredulously . \u201c Of course not , \u201d he said . \u201c If you \u2019 re in public life , where else would you rather be ? \u201d\nA few months ago , Mr. Obama read \u201c Thinking , Fast and Slow , \u201d by Daniel Kahneman , about how people make decisions \u2014 quick , instinctive thinking versus slower , contemplative deliberation . For Mr. Obama , a deliberator in an instinctive business , this may be as instructive as any political science text .\nMr. Obama , the 51-year-old Harvard law graduate , sees himself as a rational thinker and came to office with what might be called the Reasonable Person Theory of Government . If he could simply sit down and talk with other political actors , whether they be Republicans from the House or mullahs from Tehran , he seemed certain he could work something out . His faith in his own powers of persuasion was deep .\nBut politics is often not rational , at least not as Mr. Obama defined it . The Iranians have proved immune to Mr. Obama \u2019 s charm , as have the North Koreans , the Taliban and Vladimir V. Putin . So have the Republicans and , for that matter , even some Democrats .\nAfter a year of failed Middle East peacemaking , he conceded being too confident that he could cajole Israelis and Palestinians into resolving age-old disputes . \u201c We overestimated our ability to persuade them to do so when their politics ran contrary to that , \u201d he concluded at the time .\nSo , too , has his reliance on oratory diminished . At first , there was no problem , it seemed , that could not be solved by a presidential address . \u201c Race problem ? Speech , \u201d one former aide recalled . \u201c Afghanistan ? Speech. \u201d But speeches by themselves rarely generated the action he sought .\nIndeed , Mr. Obama in private sometimes expresses surprise at the constraints of the office . Lulled by his success in passing an $ 800 billion stimulus package 24 days after his inauguration , and perhaps not fully cognizant of the tone set by doing so almost exclusively with Democratic votes , he found that everything else came harder , like his health care program , or not at all , like climate and immigration legislation .\nHe keeps a list and argues that he has fulfilled most of his core promises . He pulled the country back from the economic abyss , rescued the auto industry , killed the world \u2019 s top terrorist , withdrew troops from Iraq , imposed regulations on Wall Street , put two liberal justices on the Supreme Court , signed a nuclear treaty with Russia and cut taxes for the middle class .\nYet looking back , he realizes that some of his \u201c heal the planet \u201d ambitions that would prove fodder for mockery by Mitt Romney , his Republican rival , were unrealistic , at least in four years . During the 2008 campaign , he said he would talk with rogue leaders from countries including Iran and Cuba , make peace between Pakistan and India so Pakistan could shift forces to the Afghan border , close the prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay , win Senate approval of a never-ratified test ban treaty , negotiate legislation live on C-Span and usher in a new era of bipartisanship .\nHis contemplative decision-making can be isolating . He does not readily let others in . \u201c It \u2019 s hard to gain the president \u2019 s confidence \u2014 not trust , but confidence in your judgment , \u201d Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. observed in an interview this summer . \u201c It doesn \u2019 t come easily to this president. \u201d As a result , he said , Mr. Obama demands a rigorous process . When someone proposes something , the president \u2019 s reaction is , \u201c Get me a paper on that. \u201d When he receives it , Mr. Biden said , \u201c he devours it . He masters it . \u201d\nHis deliberation proved refreshing to those weary of President George W. Bush \u2019 s swagger . \u201c I like to know what I \u2019 m talking about before I speak , \u201d Mr. Obama once said when asked why it took him days to respond to a controversy .\nBut when he waited to speak out about the would-be underwear bomber at Christmas 2009 or the BP oil spill in 2010 , he paid a political price . He learned the public wants to see its president during crises . So when a gunman shot up a movie theater in Colorado this summer , Mr. Obama appeared before cameras within hours .\nAs Mr. Kahneman said in an interview , \u201c Being a slow thinker for a leader is not necessarily an advantage because the public likes a leader to think quickly and react instinctively . \u201d\nHow has Mr. Obama applied the lessons he learned ? One day last spring , aides told him interest rates on federal student loans would double on July 1 unless Congress acted . Early on in his presidency , Mr. Obama might have invited lawmakers to the White House .\nInstead , he headed to Air Force One and flew to college campuses in North Carolina and Colorado to castigate Congress for not heading off the rate hike . There was never any debate about the strategy ; no one , even Mr. Obama , thought about talking with Republicans .\n\u201c Our view on student loans was they wouldn \u2019 t do it without really putting their backs against the wall , \u201d said David Plouffe , the president \u2019 s senior adviser . \u201c He realized this was a simple thing , it was clear , it was something we could motivate people on . \u201d\nRepublicans angrily accused the president of bad faith . \u201c He was making a political argument , \u201d said Representative John Kline of Minnesota , chairman of the education committee . \u201c I never saw any engagement from the White House about what really to do about it . \u201d\nMaybe so , but Obama aides crowed that it worked because Republicans instantly came out against the rate increase , too . Republicans said they saw it the other way , arguing that they defused the Obama attack by reacting quickly .

His has become a bloodless presidency , built on cold calculations , not quixotic crusades . His argument now boils down to asking voters to stick with him because the other side will revive failed policies that would enrich the wealthy , shred safety-net programs and undermine the economy .\nWith unemployment stuck above 8 percent and his approval ratings stuck below 50 percent , Mr. Obama has turned to the sort of campaigning he once disdained . The man who bristled when critics claimed without evidence that he was born in Kenya or was a Muslim now does not object as advisers and allies make unsubstantiated assertions about Mr. Romney \u2019 s taxes and business record .\nAsked about such incidents , he says the behavior of the Republicans is worse . He does not talk about changing Washington rules ; he is playing by the rules as he found them .\nHe is sensitive to the costs he has imposed on his own party . After the Supreme Court upheld his health care program , he reached out to three House Democrats who lost in 2010 after supporting the legislation , including Tom Perriello of Virginia , who said liberals have come around . \u201c To the extent there was a passion for Obama in 2008 , that \u2019 s matured into a comfort and a trust by 2012 , \u201d he said .\nMr. Obama is a curious mixture of bold and cautious . He spent months in what amounted to a grueling graduate seminar on Afghanistan and then disregarded his vice president and top advisers to order 30,000 more troops to the war zone . Even the action considered his most decisive , ordering the raid that killed Osama bin Laden , took place only after months of secretly monitoring intelligence and considering options .\nHe defied advisers by pressing for his expansive health care program rather than settling for a \u201c skinny \u201d alternative . Yet he stays doggedly away from hot-button issues like gun control and race , took two years to lift the ban on gays and lesbians in the military , and took even longer to endorse same-sex marriage . He appointed a bipartisan commission to fix the nation \u2019 s finances , then shelved its plan .\nOn foreign policy as well , he has his priorities , and those that do not fit are put to the side . Since pulling American forces out of Iraq , for example , he has seemed removed from its fate . Adm. Dennis C. Blair , Mr. Obama \u2019 s director of national intelligence until he was pushed out over policy and personality differences , said the president took a checklist approach to foreign policy overly influenced by domestic politics .\n\u201c There quickly developed what I thought of as the top-10 list of individual issues that needed to be worked \u2014 Iran , a treaty with Russia , the South China Sea , the Middle East peace process , \u201d he said . \u201c Never did there seem to be an idea of a strategy \u2014 where do we want to be , what \u2019 s important , and how do we get there ? \u201d\nMoreover , he said , decisions on foreign policy were shadowed by concern for how they would play with the American public . \u201c Domestic political considerations were ground in very early , very early , \u201d he said .\nThe isolation can be palpable . Riding in his motorcade after an event , Mr. Obama sometimes stares out the windows at the world he can not really touch . When he arrives at a hotel at the end of a campaign day , he confers with aides in his suite , then sometimes asks what they plan to do the rest of the evening .

Durbin , his former Illinois colleague .\nMr. Obama enjoys watching \u201c Homeland \u201d and \u201c Boardwalk Empire , \u201d and recently took in the Will Ferrell movie \u201c The Campaign \u201d ( not great , in his review , but some funny scenes ) .
