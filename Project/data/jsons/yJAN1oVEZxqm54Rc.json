    "content": "At certain moments during the past year \u2019 s long and often tedious march to November , the political class , already bored with discussing a GOP Senate takeover most considered nearly certain , started debating a few post-election hypotheticals . With Republicans in control in both the House and the Senate , would the president try again to strike the elusive grand bargain ? ( No . ) Would Senate Republicans retaliate against Democrats for choosing the so-called nuclear option ? ( Maybe . ) Would Democrats filibuster relentlessly , like Republicans did when they were the minority party in the Senate ? ( Probably not . )\nOf all the questions about a Republican Senate that hovered over the midterms , though , none cast a shadow as large as this : Would the swelling of the GOP \u2019 s ranks lead to the Tea Party finally escaping its quarantine in the House of Representatives ? Would a wave of Republican victories leave Ted Cruz , the Tea Party hero who helped author last year \u2019 s government shutdown , as the de facto leader of the U.S. Senate ? Less militant Republicans , like Sen. Mitch McConnell and Sen. John McCain , promised the answer was no . But because I \u2019 d observed the way the establishment of the party had repeatedly bowed to Tea Party threats , I was a skeptic .\nWell , it \u2019 s still more than a month until the new Congress is sworn in , but it \u2019 s already looking like we can put that debate to rest .

Soon thereafter , the Wall Street Journal reported that a bloc of no less than 50 Republicans in Congress was already maneuvering to thwart the orders by attaching language preemptively barring presidential action to \u201c must-pass \u201d legislation .
