    "content": "Mr. Bannon , a hard-charging , fast-talking confidant of the president \u2019 s whose roving job in the White House has given him influence over policy and hiring decisions , now finds himself in the undesirable position of being caught between the president and his family . That is a position that others have not survived , most notably Corey Lewandowski , the first of the president \u2019 s three campaign managers .\nMr. Bannon , whose portfolio is broad but vague as a chief strategist , has told people he believes Mr. Kushner \u2019 s allies have undermined him , that he has no plans to quit and is digging in for a fight . One option being discussed is moving Mr. Bannon to a different role . His allies at an outside group supporting him run by his main benefactor , the investor Rebekah Mercer , have also discussed him joining them to provide strategy .\nMr. Kushner , 36 , a government neophyte who has taken on a much larger portfolio as a top West Wing aide and foreign envoy , was said to be displeased after hearing that Mr. Bannon made critical remarks about him to other aides and Trump associates while he was in Iraq recently . Mr. Bannon has told confidants that he believes Mr. Kushner \u2019 s contact with Russians , and his expected testimony before Congress on the subject , will become a major distraction for the White House .\nKushner allies have also raised the issue with the president of the increasingly unflattering coverage that Mr. Kushner is receiving from Breitbart News , the right-wing website that Mr. Bannon used to run .\nBut Mr. Bannon has his own core of supporters outside the White House . And he has argued that Mr. Kushner \u2019 s efforts to pull his father-in-law more to the center on issues like immigration would poison him with the conservative base \u2014 a hopeless position to be in because Mr. Bannon believes so few Democrats would ever consider supporting Mr. Trump .\nIn the White House blame game , no one is safe . Mr. Bannon \u2019 s team is blamed for the contested and controversial travel bans . Mr. Priebus was damaged by the failure of health care legislation . Mr. Kushner has yet to show he can master his own portfolio , and his role is so large that miscues will be magnified .\nMr. Trump does not like any staff member gaining too much attention , including those who are related to him .
