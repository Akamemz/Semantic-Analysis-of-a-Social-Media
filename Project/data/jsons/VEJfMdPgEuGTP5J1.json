He said their plight should invoke the Golden Rule and implored compassion from the U.S .\n\u201c This rule points us in a clear direction : Let us treat others with the same passion and compassion with which we want to be treated . Let us seek for others the same possibilities which we seek for ourselves , \u201d he said . \u201c In a word , if we want security , let us give security . If we want life , let us give life . If we want opportunities , let us provide opportunities .\n\u201c The yardstick we use for others will be the yardstick which time will use for us , \u201d the pontiff said , drawing a standing ovation from the assembled House and Senate .\nEmerging from the House chamber , he paused to reflect at a statue of St. Junipero Serra , the founder of nine California mission churches in the 18th century , whom the pope canonized as a saint in a Mass on Wednesday .\nThe pontiff then appeared on the balcony overlooking the National Mall on the Capitol \u2019 s west front , where he delivered a special blessing for the children who were among tens of thousands who gathered to hear the address simulcast on monitors outside .\nAfter speaking to the country \u2019 s powerful , he drove a dozen blocks to St. Patrick \u2019 s Church and the Washington Archdiocese \u2019 s branch of Catholic Charities , where some of the city \u2019 s homeless were gathered to share a meal with him .\nAfter leaving Washington on a chartered American Airlines jet , he arrived in New York to be greeted by a high school brass band playing the Frank Sinatra standard \u201c New York , New York . \u201d\nThousands of cheering people lined the streets of lower Manhattan as Francis made his way to St. Patrick \u2019 s Cathedral for an evening vespers prayer service , where he specifically thanked American nuns , a move seen as an apology for a crackdown on dissent in their orders by his predecessors .\nHe told the cathedral pews full of U.S. ordained and religious that he wanted to thank American nuns for their courage and spirit and \u201c that I love you very much . \u201d\nOn Friday in New York , Francis will address the United Nations , participate in an interfaith service at the Sept. 11 memorial , visit a Catholic school in Harlem and celebrate Mass at Madison Square Garden .\nHe heads to Philadelphia on Saturday morning for a weekend of meetings on church doctrine on the family .\nHis speech Thursday marked the first time the head of the Roman Catholic Church has addressed Congress \u2014 an event that sprang chiefly from the efforts of House Speaker John A. Boehner , an Ohio Republican and a Catholic , who pursued the invitation after the pope announced the Philadelphia meetings last year .\nMr. Boehner , known for getting emotional , repeatedly wiped tears from his eyes as he sat on the dais behind the pope , listening to the steward of his church both praise and challenge America . Also sitting behind the pope was another Catholic , Vice President Joseph R. Biden .\n\u201c What a moment for our country , \u201d Mr. Boehner said afterward . \u201c The Holy Father \u2019 s visit is surely a blessing for all of us .
