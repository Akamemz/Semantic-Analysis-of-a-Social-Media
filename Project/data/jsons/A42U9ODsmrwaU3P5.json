    "content": "\u201c Beginning in March 2019 , the situation at the embassy and in Ukraine changed dramatically . Specifically , the three priorities of security , economy and justice , and our support for Ukrainian democratic resistance to Russian aggression , became overshadowed by a political agenda promoted by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and a cadre of officials operating with a direct channel to the White House. \u201d \u201c Based on questions and statements I \u2019 ve heard , some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country \u2014 and that perhaps , somehow , for some reason , Ukraine did . This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves . The unfortunate truth is that Russia was the foreign power that systematically attacked our democratic institutions in 2016 . And I refuse to be part of an effort to legitimize an alternate narrative that the Ukrainian government is a U.S. adversary and that Ukraine , not Russia , attacked us in 2016. \u201d \u201c Although the hold on the security assistance may have been lifted , there are still things they wanted that they weren \u2019 t getting , including a meeting with the president in the Oval Office . So \u2014 and I think that continues to this day , I think they \u2019 re being very careful . They still need us. \u201d \u201c Obviously what Mr. Giuliani was saying was pretty explosive in any case . He was frequently on television making quite incendiary remarks about everyone involved in this , and that he was clearly pushing forward issues and ideas that would , you know , probably come back to haunt us . And , in fact , I think that that \u2019 s where we are today. \u201d \u201c We asked Ambassador Sondland about that at his deposition . He indicated you were upset and you were upset with Ambassador Bolton and upset with the way things were going \u2014 \u201d \u201c Very unfortunately , I had a bit of a blowup with Ambassador Sondland , and I had a couple of testy encounters with him . He was being involved in a domestic political errand \u2014 and we were being involved in national security foreign policy . And those two things had just diverged . But I was irritated with him and angry with him that he wasn \u2019 t fully coordinating . And I did say to him , \u2018 Ambassador Sondland , Gordon , I think this is all going to blow up. \u2019 And here we are. \u201d \u201c You may be aware of some of the attacks on Colonel Vindman suggesting that he has a dual loyalty \u2014 that he \u2019 s not really loyal to America , he \u2019 s loyal to Ukraine . I want to ask you as a fellow immigrant what you think of those kind of accusations when they \u2019 re leveled against Colonel Vindman or other Americans ? \u201d \u201c This is my country , and the country that I serve . And I know for a fact that every single one of my colleagues , and there were many naturalized citizens in my office and across the National Security Council , felt exactly the same way . I think it \u2019 s deeply unfair . And so when I came in , Gordon Sondland was basically saying , well , look , we have a deal here that there will be a meeting , I have a deal here with Chief of Staff Mulvaney , there will be a meeting if the Ukrainians open up or announce these investigations into 2016 and Burisma \u2014 and I cut it off immediately there . Because by this point , having heard Mr. Giuliani over and over again on the television , and all of the issues that he was asserting , by this point it was clear that Burisma was code for the Bidens , because Giuliani was laying it out there . I could see why Colonel Vindman was alarmed and he said , this is inappropriate , we \u2019 re the National Security Council , we can \u2019 t be involved in this. \u201d \u201c Did your boss \u2014 Doctor , I mean , Ambassador Bolton , tell you that Giuliani was , quote , \u2018 a hand grenade \u2019 ? \u201d \u201c He did , yes. \u201d \u201c What do you think he meant by his characterization of Giuliani as a hand grenade ? \u201d \u201c What he meant by this was pretty clear to me in the context of all of the statements that Mr. Giuliani was making publicly \u2014 that the investigations that he was promoting , that the storyline he was promoting , the narrative he was promoting , was going to backfire. \u201d \u201c And it \u2019 s time for this phase of the publicly announced and proclaimed Democrat coup to end . Thank you for your service . Thanks for being here . And I yield back. \u201d \u201c Could I actually say something ? Because we \u2019 ve had three \u2014 \u201d \u201c Doctor , I was going to \u2014 I was going to ask you if you \u2019 d like to respond . There have been \u2014 \u201d \u201c I yielded back ! \u201d \u201c I \u2014 gentleman will suspend \u2014 Dr. Hill , you may respond. \u201d I think all of us who came here under a legal obligation also felt we had a moral obligation to do so . We came as fact witnesses . We need to be together again in 2020 , so the American people can make a choice about the future and about \u2014 to make their votes in a presidential election without any fear . \u201d",
