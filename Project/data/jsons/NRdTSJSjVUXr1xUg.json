While it 's useful to have House Republicans on the record with a legislative plan , the plan does n't offer any estimate for how much it would cost , or how many people it would ( or would n't ) cover . In general , it 's not clear what problems this particular bill would actually solve .\nThe bill would replace Obamacare 's subsidies with a system of tax credits and halt the law 's Medicaid expansion at the end of the decade while grandfathering in many beneficiaries over the long term and giving states $ 100 billion in funding to work with to care for hard case patients . All in all , it 's a fairly conventional Republican plan , modified in ways designed to mitigate recent political objections .\nThe tax credit is , for the moment , the most controversial component of the legislation . As in previous drafts of the bill , the credits are refundable , meaning that individuals will be eligible for them even if their total tax liability is lower than the amount of the credit .

Conservative legislators have argued that such a system would be little more than Obamacare lite . Sen.

''\nUnlike Obamacare , which bases its credits on income , the GOP bills we 've seen so far are based on age . That creates another set of political headaches , because it means that wealthier folks get tax credits , and because it means that older people would get less help than under Obamacare , in hopes of creating a scheme that lures more young and health people into the system .\nThe bill released tonight attempts to mitigate these problems by capping the refundable credit so that households earning more than $ 150,000 would be reduced , and individuals making more than $ 215,000 would get nothing at all .
