    "content": "\u2588\u2588\u2588 Illinois is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power . Sign up to get weekly updates about our work . This article was produced in partnership with WBEZ , which is a member of the \u2588\u2588\u2588 Local Reporting Network .\nThe Cook County Jail in Chicago is one of the largest in the country . Sprawling across 96 acres on the Southwest Side , the facility houses more than 4,000 people , most awaiting trial . Its cramped living conditions made it a perfect petri dish for COVID-19 .\nToday , the jail is home to one of the largest known outbreaks in the country and has been a flashpoint in the national debate over how to contain the virus in correctional facilities . More than 9,400 cases have emerged in prisons across the U.S. , according to an analysis by The Marshall Project . In the Cook County Jail , nearly 500 detainees and more than 300 correctional officers have tested positive . Seven people have died : six inmates and one guard .\nSheriff Tom Dart is now under fire for his oversight of the jail in the era of coronavirus . In a federal lawsuit , civil rights attorneys have blamed him for failing to curtail what they have called a \u201c rapidly escalating public health disaster , \u201d and the judge in that case has ordered Dart to improve sanitation , to expand social distancing and to report back on his progress .\nAt the same time , the judge said Dart had made a \u201c significant , and impressive , effort to safeguard detained persons in his custody from infection by coronavirus . \u201d\nDart has repeatedly defended his handling of the health crisis . While citing unique challenges \u2014 like weighing if a detainee might use hygiene supplies as a weapon , as one allegedly did this month by using soap inside a sock in an attack \u2014 he has maintained that his office has \u201c been in front of this pandemic every step of the way , \u201d from screening new admissions for the virus to supplying staff and detainees with hand sanitizer to educating detainees about social distancing .\nBut people who live and work inside the jail say otherwise .\nWBEZ and \u2588\u2588\u2588 interviewed a dozen correctional officers , health care staff and inmates about how authorities responded to the crisis . They described a lack of personal protective equipment , inadequate testing and a spillover to community hospitals , as confusion and terror spread along with the virus . Taken together , their accounts offer potential lessons for other institutions that are now facing their own outbreaks .\nDart declined an interview , but his office responded to a list of questions . Below are people \u2019 s stories in their own words , edited for length and clarity . Some staff and detainees spoke to us on the condition that we not publish their names , because they were concerned about repercussions .\nI would say it was toward the end of February that I started getting phone calls from staff members saying : \u201c I \u2019 m feeling sick , I \u2019 m feeling weak . My partners are going through the same problems , they \u2019 re coughing. \u201d At first , people kind of shrugged it off as the flu or something like that . Then , once the pandemic hit , we knew at that point there was a problem .\nStaff say the sheriff warned employees with COVID-19 symptoms to stay home . In a statement , the sheriff \u2019 s office said it began medical screenings of employees who returned to work after an absence on March 19 . On March 22 , the sheriff \u2019 s office announced that a Cook County correctional officer tested positive for COVID-19 . The next day , two detainees also tested positive .\nWe all heard it on the news . I was in the medical part of the jail because I was pregnant . And a lot of women were taking high blood pressure medicine or diabetes medicine . I remember the conversation clear as day . We said , \u201c We need to get up out of here before we die. \u201d We were scared . Some of us was crying .\nEverybody got a bed and it \u2019 s close to each other , it \u2019 s just like a dorm room . We were all making sure our hands are clean . Make sure we talked about it . \u201c How you doing ? How are you feeling ? Are you breathing OK ? \u201d\nBy me being pregnant , one of the guards told me they was praying for me to get out : \u201c You are carrying another body inside of you. \u201d I \u2019 m just praying that they can let the elderly people up out of there .\nJust by word of mouth you hear : \u201c Hey , this guy just has to go to the hospital . These inmates over here are all quarantined. \u201d We all just looked at each other like , \u201c Let me get 6 feet away from you guys. \u201d Because at that time we had no protection . It \u2019 s a really scary situation .\nWe all pretty much resigned ourselves to the fact that we were going to get some form of COVID-19 . I mean , for some people , it \u2019 s scary . For other people , it \u2019 s just resignation .\nAcross the country , hospitals , nursing homes , jails and prisons are scrambling for supplies to fight COVID-19 . Dart reassured the public that he had begun preparing in January and his office was taking actions to keep people in the jail safe .\nBut multiple staff members and detainees say that while the sheriff \u2019 s office sometimes supplied some soap , hand sanitizer and cleaning supplies , availability was limited .\nDart addressed the issue in a March press conference . By that point , there were 38 detainees and nine staff members who had tested positive . The sheriff \u2019 s remarks are excerpted below .\nI \u2019 ve had this thing come up now three times about soap . And I \u2019 ve told people : Please , I have a really complicated job . My staff does as well . Either stop lying , which you \u2019 re doing , or if you \u2019 re aware of somebody who does not have soap \u2014 unless your idea of fun is to make sure that person gets sick \u2014 I would suggest you \u2019 d give me the name of that person so I can get them some soap .\nThis is not going to end tomorrow or the following day , it \u2019 s just not going to happen . That \u2019 s wishful crazy thinking , and so thoughtful people put plans together , long-term plans . And that \u2019 s what we \u2019 ve done here .\nThat \u2019 s all a joke . I had to fight to get gloves . I had to call in favors from other areas of the jail to get the basic surgical masks . We were on our own . At one point PPE equipment was available . But it was locked up in an administrator \u2019 s office , and we \u2019 re getting yelled at by supervisors . \u201c Why don \u2019 t we have it ? \u201d \u201c Well , I don \u2019 t have access to his office . Why are you yelling at me ? \u201d And then it still took an additional two days to pass it out . Some of the equipment is so old , the bands were rotted .\nOn March 28 , less than a week after the first reported cases of COVID-19 in the jail , the numbers soared : A total of 89 detainees and 12 sheriff \u2019 s office employees had tested positive .\nMy phone doesn \u2019 t stop ringing . These officers call me all night with concerns . And I want to talk to everyone . There will be times when I \u2019 m talking until 3 o \u2019 clock in the morning . I saw officers that did not have masks . I saw officers that were confused on what was disinfectant and what was hand sanitizer . There \u2019 s no system set in place , where on a consistent basis that everybody is being given these things every day .\nIn court filings , the sheriff said he worked to obtain PPE and in light of national shortages \u201c explored unconventional methods \u201d of getting supplies , such as donations . The sheriff \u2019 s office also said in a statement that it provided a hotline number for staff to contact if they are having any issues with PPE .\nThere was no onsite testing for employees at that point , so I went proactively to get it done elsewhere . Like , I had better do it just to be on the safe side . A week and a half later they called : \u201c You \u2019 ve got it. \u201d And I was like , \u201c Great , so I \u2019 ve been walking around for a week and a half. \u201d I was already working double shifts at the time . I felt really guilty . I had a mild case . I walked around , possibly infecting the people I \u2019 m trying to protect . Every decision I make there comes down to one thing : What is going to screw us the least ? Because we \u2019 re all getting screwed . Like no matter what we do , we \u2019 re going to get screwed somehow .\nThe sheriff \u2019 s office said starting March 28 it took the temperature of employees entering and exiting the jail and sent away anyone who showed symptoms .\nDive Deeper Into Our Reporting Our newsletter is written by a \u2588\u2588\u2588 Illinois reporter every week\nBy March 31 , there were 4,767 people in the facility \u2014 about 800 fewer than at the beginning of the month . To help reduce the jail \u2019 s population , Cook County prosecutors , defense attorneys and judges had expedited bond hearings , resulting in the release of scores of people who were accused of crimes but still waiting to go to trial . Dart said he assisted by helping identify detainees who would be \u201c suitable for release . \u201d\nBut , because most other court functions had been shut down , trials and hearings were delayed .\nI \u2019 m supposed to go to court for a new sentencing hearing . And God willing , I \u2019 ll be getting time served . But instead of going to court and being let out , now I \u2019 m stuck here and it \u2019 s really messing with my mental health . It \u2019 s hard for me to sleep . I \u2019 ve been putting in request after request to see my mental health care professional . Prior to this whole crisis , you can drop a medical slip for anything and they would call you and treat you . But now it \u2019 s like we \u2019 re just left to fend for ourselves . It \u2019 s really , really frightening . They just recently started handing out face masks . But that \u2019 s only when the COs decide to . They want you to jump through hoops just to get basic things to protect yourself . What do I do ? I wrote a letter to my family . I told them I love them and if I should pass , I hope God can forgive me for all my sins .\nCounty officials say they continued to provide mental health services throughout the pandemic .\nThe sheriff \u2019 s office said it created a team on April 2 to ensure PPE was being used properly .\nThe first COVID-19-positive person detained at Cook County Jail died on April 5 . Jeffrey Pendleton was 59 and in jail on gun and drug charges . Pendleton had a $ 50,000 bond , which , in Cook County , means he would have had to pay $ 5,000 to go home while he awaited trial .\nIt made us want to break out of here , because they are letting us die . And knowing that that individual had never been proven guilty , that \u2019 s even worse .\nIt \u2019 s disturbing when we look outside the window and we see ambulances coming out of the county jail because it makes it feel like , \u201c OK , when is it gon na be my turn ? \u201d\nOn April 6 , two weeks after the first correctional officer tested positive , the sheriff made testing available to staff on-site . Cermak , a medical treatment facility for the jail , also obtained newly developed rapid test kits .\nWithin days , the number of known cases among detainees tripled , to more than 300 people . Two people had died .\nThe virus was also rapidly spreading among the staff , with 174 correctional officers testing positive . The sheriff was opening up unused parts of the jail to make room for social distancing and quarantining , which required more staff . Correctional officers say staff were forced to work 16-hour days .\nThese officers are being chewed up , spit out . The mandated work , the 16-hour days . You know , it \u2019 s a lot for anybody . Their immune systems are breaking down .\nThe sheriff \u2019 s office told WBEZ and \u2588\u2588\u2588 the mandated overtime was necessary \u201c to provide a safe and secure facility. \u201d The office also reassigned 328 sheriff \u2019 s deputies who usually work in the courts to come and staff the jail .\nOne employee received notice that he would be going to Division 6 , which staff members say was ground zero for the virus .\nWhen I got the email , I was home . I looked at my phone , I was like : \u201c You got ta be kidding me . You \u2019 re sending me into the hotbed where all the infected are. \u201d I tried to keep it from the wife . But she knew something was wrong . I wasn \u2019 t talking . I was livid . I contemplated quitting . I \u2019 ve seen what this virus can do . I saw a co-worker from the jail , who I \u2019 m talking to one day , and the next thing I know , he \u2019 s calling me saying , \u201c Hey , man , I got oxygen flowing. \u201d And he shows me a video of himself . He \u2019 s a mellow guy , and to see the look in his face \u2014 this wasn \u2019 t the same person . I don \u2019 t want to be overly dramatic , but he looked like he was scared to death .\nRead More Life and Death , But No Trash Pickup : Diary of a Young COVID-19 Nurse Despite all the talk about appreciating health care workers , one California nurse caring for the sickest patients felt she needed more support .\nI can not go over to the jail and bring this virus back to my children . So now when I come home , I throw all my clothes in the washing machine , I take a shower in the basement and I sleep in my basement . My son comes to the top of the stairs and I \u2019 m at the bottom of stairs talking to him , wearing a mask .\nThe Cook County Health System hired additional nurses through a staffing firm to go to the jail . But inmates were also being sent to outside hospitals , including Cook County \u2019 s Stroger Hospital , where Elizabeth Lalasz works .\nMy unit has turned into a COVID-only unit for the inmates at Cook County Jail . It \u2019 s quite stunning . We have limits on the numbers of critical care beds and limits on the human beings who can take care of them . Nurses have actually been the primary people taking care of everything because of the lack of PPE . We pick up the garbage , we are giving respiratory treatments \u2014 things that other workers within the hospital would normally be doing . My union , [ National Nurses United ] , is demanding a decarceration of all nonviolent offenders from the Cook County Jail . It \u2019 s really about decreasing the numbers of people who actually contract this virus and come into the hospital .\nElizabeth Lalasz speaks at a rally outside the Cook County Jail on April 10 . ( Manuel Martinez/WBEZ )\nIn their lawsuit against Dart , civil rights lawyers maintain that people who work and live inside the facility are in danger . In early April , they asked a federal judge to force the county to immediately release medically vulnerable detainees . The judge did not grant them that request , but did order the sheriff to improve sanitation .\nPlaintiffs said some detainees were receiving masks and soap . However , they added , they lacked cleaning supplies for their cells , and testing was inadequate .\nWe have several elderly people here . They don \u2019 t have energy and their chest hurts . And staff only take their temperature and they tell them , \u201c OK , since you don \u2019 t have a fever , nothing \u2019 s wrong with you . \u201d\nRegardless of the pandemic , we only clean our cells once a week . They give us some really small sized soaps , once a week . \u2026 It \u2019 s not enough . You have to go to commissary and you have to get your cleaning supplies yourself . So if you don \u2019 t have any money , there \u2019 s nothing that you can really do . I mop myself with my own rags . I buy towels .\nMultiple detainees who spoke with WBEZ and \u2588\u2588\u2588 expressed similar concerns about cleaning their cells .\nThe sheriff \u2019 s office said that detainees are provided with \u201c ample \u201d cleaning supplies to keep their living areas clean , and they are supervised by staff while cleaning their cells daily .\nCounty officials said testing for the coronavirus has been informed by guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and driven primarily by the availability of tests .\nOn April 19 , the first correctional officer testing positive for the coronavirus , Sheila Rivera , 47 , died .\nThis is not like working in a jail like it was before . This is what I tell myself : You \u2019 re working in a petri dish . Be very , very , very , very mindful of it .\nYou don \u2019 t want to get too close to people , so you don \u2019 t want to have to physically restrain or detain anyone . You learn to de-escalate things a lot faster . When you tell people , \u201c Hey man , you can \u2019 t stand in the doorway . Go back inside , \u201d and they want to stand in there anyway , normally it would be : immediately grab a person , put them against the wall and handcuff them . Now it \u2019 s more : \u201c Why are you standing in the doorway ? What \u2019 s going on with you ? \u201d You \u2019 re more pressed to really find out what \u2019 s going on . And you find some of them just want attention because they don \u2019 t have anybody to talk to at home . They \u2019 ll tell you : \u201c I haven \u2019 t talked to my girl in a month . I have kids at home I haven \u2019 t seen. \u201d OK , I can understand it . I can really relate with you on that one . Because I \u2019 m sleeping in the basement right now .\nShannon Heffernan is a criminal justice reporter for WBEZ . She \u2019 s also reported on mental health , poverty , labor and climate change .

The sheriff was opening up unused parts of the jail to make room for social distancing and quarantining, which required more staff. Correctional officers say staff were forced to work 16-hour days.\n\nEvans\n\nThese officers are being chewed up, spit out. The mandated work, the 16-hour days. You know, it\u2019s a lot for anybody. Their immune systems are breaking down.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office told WBEZ and ProPublica the mandated overtime was necessary \u201cto provide a safe and secure facility.\u201d The office also reassigned 328 sheriff\u2019s deputies who usually work in the courts to come and staff the jail.\n\nCook County Jail (Manuel Martinez/WBEZ)\n\nOne employee received notice that he would be going to Division 6, which staff members say was ground zero for the virus.\n\nSheriff\u2019s Staffer A\n\nWhen I got the email, I was home. I looked at my phone, I was like: \u201cYou gotta be kidding me. You\u2019re sending me into the hotbed where all the infected are.\u201d I tried to keep it from the wife. But she knew something was wrong. I wasn\u2019t talking. I was livid. I contemplated quitting. I\u2019ve seen what this virus can do. I saw a co-worker from the jail, who I\u2019m talking to one day, and the next thing I know, he\u2019s calling me saying, \u201cHey, man, I got oxygen flowing.\u201d And he shows me a video of himself. He\u2019s a mellow guy, and to see the look in his face \u2014 this wasn\u2019t the same person. I don\u2019t want to be overly dramatic, but he looked like he was scared to death.\n\nRead More Life and Death, But No Trash Pickup: Diary of a Young COVID-19 Nurse Despite all the talk about appreciating health care workers, one California nurse caring for the sickest patients felt she needed more support.\n\nI cannot go over to the jail and bring this virus back to my children. So now when I come home, I throw all my clothes in the washing machine, I take a shower in the basement and I sleep in my basement. My son comes to the top of the stairs and I\u2019m at the bottom of stairs talking to him, wearing a mask.\n\nHealth care staff also felt the strain.\n\nThe Cook County Health System hired additional nurses through a staffing firm to go to the jail. But inmates were also being sent to outside hospitals, including Cook County\u2019s Stroger Hospital, where Elizabeth Lalasz works.\n\nElizabeth Lalasz, Nurse\n\nMy unit has turned into a COVID-only unit for the inmates at Cook County Jail. It\u2019s quite stunning. We have limits on the numbers of critical care beds and limits on the human beings who can take care of them. Nurses have actually been the primary people taking care of everything because of the lack of PPE. We pick up the garbage, we are giving respiratory treatments \u2014 things that other workers within the hospital would normally be doing. My union, [National Nurses United], is demanding a decarceration of all nonviolent offenders from the Cook County Jail. It\u2019s really about decreasing the numbers of people who actually contract this virus and come into the hospital.\n\nElizabeth Lalasz speaks at a rally outside the Cook County Jail on April 10. (Manuel Martinez/WBEZ)\n\nIn their lawsuit against Dart, civil rights lawyers maintain that people who work and live inside the facility are in danger. In early April, they asked a federal judge to force the county to immediately release medically vulnerable detainees. The judge did not grant them that request, but did order the sheriff to improve sanitation.\n\nPlaintiffs said some detainees were receiving masks and soap. However, they added, they lacked cleaning supplies for their cells, and testing was inadequate.\n\nMartinez\n\nWe have several elderly people here. They don\u2019t have energy and their chest hurts. And staff only take their temperature and they tell them, \u201cOK, since you don\u2019t have a fever, nothing\u2019s wrong with you.\u201d\n\nRegardless of the pandemic, we only clean our cells once a week. They give us some really small sized soaps, once a week. \u2026 It\u2019s not enough. You have to go to commissary and you have to get your cleaning supplies yourself. So if you don\u2019t have any money, there\u2019s nothing that you can really do. I mop myself with my own rags. I buy towels.\n\nMultiple detainees who spoke with WBEZ and ProPublica expressed similar concerns about cleaning their cells.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office said that detainees are provided with \u201cample\u201d cleaning supplies to keep their living areas clean, and they are supervised by staff while cleaning their cells daily.\n\nCounty officials said testing for the coronavirus has been informed by guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and driven primarily by the availability of tests.\n\nOn April 19, the first correctional officer testing positive for the coronavirus, Sheila Rivera, 47, died.\n\nSheriff\u2019s Staffer A\n\nThis is not like working in a jail like it was before. This is what I tell myself: You\u2019re working in a petri dish. Be very, very, very, very mindful of it.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to get too close to people, so you don\u2019t want to have to physically restrain or detain anyone. You learn to de-escalate things a lot faster. When you tell people, \u201cHey man, you can\u2019t stand in the doorway. Go back inside,\u201d and they want to stand in there anyway, normally it would be: immediately grab a person, put them against the wall and handcuff them. Now it\u2019s more: \u201cWhy are you standing in the doorway? What\u2019s going on with you?\u201d You\u2019re more pressed to really find out what\u2019s going on. And you find some of them just want attention because they don\u2019t have anybody to talk to at home. They\u2019ll tell you: \u201cI haven\u2019t talked to my girl in a month. I have kids at home I haven\u2019t seen.\u201d OK, I can understand it. I can really relate with you on that one. Because I\u2019m sleeping in the basement right now.\n\nShannon Heffernan is a criminal justice reporter for WBEZ. She\u2019s also reported on mental health, poverty, labor and climate change.
