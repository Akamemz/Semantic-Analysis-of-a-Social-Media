    "content": "The Obama administration said Friday it will stop deporting most illegal immigrant students and young adults in a campaign-year move that escalates the immigration debate to the fore .\nFor years the administration had said it didn \u2019 t have the authority to make such a move , saying it couldn \u2019 t decide to stop deporting wide categories of people on its own without approval from Congress .\nBut on Friday President Obama says administration now interprets the law to give it the discretion .\n\u201c Effective immediately , the Department of Homeland Security is taking steps to lift the shadow of deportation from these young people , \u201d Mr. Obama said in an appearance in the White House Rose Garden . \u201c Over the next few months , eligible individuals who do not present a risk to national security or public safety will be able to request temporary relief from deportation proceedings and apply for work authorization . \u201d\nMr. Obama said the action was meant to be a temporary fix for our \u201c broken immigration system \u201d and urged Congress to pass a more permanent solution such as the DREAM Act .\n\u201c This is not amnesty , \u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201c This is not immunity . This is not a path to citizenship . It \u2019 s not a permanent fix . This is a temporary stopgap measure that lets us focus our resources wisely , while giving a degree of relief and hope to talented , driven , patriotic young people . It is the right thing to do . \u201d\nMr. Obama angrily shot down a reporter for the conservative Daily Caller who interrupted his remarks with the question , \u201c Why do you favor foreigners over American workers ? \u201d\nLater in the remarks , the president seemed to address the reporter : \u201c In answer to your question , this is the right thing to do for the American people . \u201d\nHomeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said she would institute the law with discretion .\n\u201c Our nation \u2019 s immigration laws must be enforced in a firm and sensible manner , \u201d she said in a statement announcing the move . \u201c But they are not designed to be blindly enforced without consideration given to the individual circumstances of each case . Nor are they designed to remove productive young people to countries where they may not have lived or even speak the language . Discretion , which is used in so many other areas , is especially justified here . \u201d\nHer move grants \u201c deferred action \u201d \u2014 meaning the department will no longer pursue deportations for those who qualify .\nThe decision is an effort to go around Congress , which has repeatedly failed to pass a bill granting legal status to this category of illegal immigrants . That type of legislation is usually called the Dream Act , though details vary depending on the version .\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith , Texas Republican , said the new amnesty will become \u201c a magnet for fraud , \u201d and will end up letting jobs go to current illegal immigrants .\n\u201c How can the Administration justify allowing illegal immigrants to work in the U.S. when millions of Americans are unemployed ? \u201d Mr. Smith said . \u201c President Obama and his administration once again have put partisan politics and illegal immigrants ahead of the rule of law and the American people . \u201d\nBut Sen.

Often they were brought to the U.S. as children and in some cases babies or toddlers , and have no knowledge of the countries where they were born .\nIn her statement Ms. Napolitano said her department will stop deporting those illegal immigrants who are under 30 years of age , have graduated from high school , gotten an equivalency diploma or joined the U.S. military and don \u2019 t have a felony or major misdemeanor on their record .\nThe exact number of people who would qualify is unclear , though the Migration Policy Institute has calculated that at least one version of the Dream Act introduced in Congress could have granted status to 2.1 million people .\nThat \u2019 s also a lower bar than some in Congress had envisioned for granting legal status to illegal immigrants .\nMs. Napolitano \u2019 s decision doesn \u2019 t automatically put these illegal immigrants on a path to citizenship , which is what immigrant-rights advocates call for .
