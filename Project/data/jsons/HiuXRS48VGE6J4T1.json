    "content": "For emergency planners , there \u2019 s a simple maxim : \u201c If you \u2019 re ready for an earthquake , you \u2019 re ready for a lot of different things , \u201d Barb Graff ( no relation ) , head of emergency management in Seattle , once told me . But for her in Seattle , it \u2019 s also a necessity : The most real threat the Pacific Northwest faces is a megathrust earthquake along what \u2019 s known as the Cascadia Subduction Zone .\nCalifornia \u2019 s \u201c Big One , \u201d along the San Andreas Fault , gets most of the attention , but there are three other U.S. faults that cause emergency planners perhaps even more heartburn .\nFirst , the Cascadia Subduction Zone , a fault running for about 700 miles off the Pacific Coast of Oregon and Washington , or what the New Yorker called in 2015 , \u201c The Really Big One. \u201d The fault , when it goes , might unleash \u201c only \u201d an earthquake between 8 and 8.6 magnitude , which itself would rank as one of the most powerful and destructive quakes to ever hit the United States . But a so-called full margin rupture of the fault would prove truly catastrophic , potentially topping 9.0 . Beyond the quake \u2019 s damage from the shaking , it could cause a multihundred-mile tsunami to inundate the West Coast with just 15 minutes warning . FEMA \u2019 s projections show 13,000 initial deaths from the quake and the tsunami , and upward of a million people displaced . These are hardly abstract threats ; geologists say there \u2019 s a 1-in-3 chance of an 8.0 earthquake in the region in the next 50 years . \u201c The amount of devastation is going to be unbelievable , \u201d Oregon geologist Rob Witter said in 2009 , after calculating that a full 9.0 quake has a 10 percent to 14 percent chance of occurring in the next half century . \u201c People are n't going to be ready for this . \u201d\nSecond , the New Madrid Seismic Zone\u2014named for a Missouri town and running from Arkansas up to Illinois\u2014has historically produced the strongest earthquakes in the lower-48 states . In the winter of 1811-1812 , a series of three quakes shifted land more than 15 feet , liquified the ground and caused whole islands to disappear . In a 2019 regional exercise , known as \u201c Shaken Fury , \u201d local , state and federal officials drilled on how to respond to a 7.7 magnitude New Madrid earthquake . Daniel Kaniewski , a managing director at Marsh & McLennan who until February served as the No . 2 at FEMA , recalls visiting one major state emergency operations centers and discovering that officials there refused to even simulate a quake of that strength ; they \u2019 d determined that the local devastation would be so great that emergency planners would have no adequate response , even in a tabletop exercise . \u201c Just the exercise alone could so tax the system that there would n't be valuable lessons learned , \u201d he recalls . \u201c That earthquake is one that we as a nation are very vulnerable to . \u201d\nThe U.S. Geological Survey estimates that the New Madrid Seismic Zone has roughly a 7 percent to 10 percent chance of a catastrophic-level 8.0 quake in the next 50 years , but given the region \u2019 s lack of preparedness , weaker building codes than California , and a civilian population largely unaware , even a 6.0 earthquake\u2014which has a 25 percent to 40 percent chance of occurring in the next half-century\u2014might prove devastating .\n\u201c What has been so unique about Covid is the national impact\u2014it \u2019 s the first time we \u2019 ve seen simultaneous emergency declarations in all 50 states\u2014and the closest thing to that level is a New Madrid event . It would be a large-scale significant disruption across the heartland\u2014a lot of your protein production , your food and agriculture , goods that get shipped via the Mississippi , or across the country on tractor-trailers , \u201d Krebs says .\nThird , and probably least known of all , is the Wasatch fault zone , stretching across Utah and Idaho , tracing the rough outline of the Salt Lake Valley , and which has been active even just in recent days ; in March , it recorded a 5.7 magnitude quake . \u201c The earthquake in Idaho and Utah was a big wake-up call , \u201d Phoenix , the volcanologist , says . Larger earthquakes in the region might quickly prove devastating . \u201c Wasatch is every bit as concerning as a Southern California quake , not simply because of the magnitude potential but because of the vulnerabilities present there , \u201d Kaniewski says . \u201c Much of the building construction in Salt Lake City is unreinforced masonry\u2014URM\u2014and it crumbles when a quake happens . \u201d\nOf course , California \u2019 s \u201c Big One , \u201d whenever it arrives , will be no walk in the park either . In 2008 , the U.S. government released the results of an extensive , multiyear effort by 300 experts to model a devastating earthquake in Southern California . Known as the \u201c Great California Shakeout , \u201d the report modeled a 7.8 earthquake on a southern portion of the San Andreas Fault that last shook in 1690 . \u201c The Shakeout \u201d would result in 1,800 deaths , 50,000 injuries , and more than $ 200 billion in damage ; many of the deaths would come in the fires afterward . The U.S. Geological Survey currently estimates that there is a 60 percent chance of a 6.7 magnitude or larger quake in the next 30 years in Los Angeles and a 72 percent chance of a 6.7 or larger quake in San Francisco .\nAs Krebs , Kaniewski and Graff all point out , any major quake isn \u2019 t just about the shaking\u2014it \u2019 s a regional economic calamity and humanitarian crisis delivered without warning in just a minute or two . The systemic impacts are huge ; the headquarters and major operations of the nation \u2019 s four trillion-dollar companies\u2014Amazon , Microsoft , Apple and Google\u2014exist in these high-risk quake zones , and much of the nation \u2019 s imports and exports come into ports on the West Coast that could be rendered unusable by a large quake .\nThen of course there \u2019 s the most frightening scenario emergency planners could face this year : several of the above . As FEMA preps for a hurricane season made all the more complex by the Covid outbreak , it faces the entirely foreseeable ( even likely ) possibility of confronting three or more large-scale disasters unfolding simultaneously this summer and fall : Wildfires out West , hurricanes in the Atlantic , and Covid-19 anywhere and everywhere . Add in the always-real possibility of , say , an earthquake ( Kaniewski \u2019 s maxim , informed by his years working in FEMA , is simply , \u201c It 's always earthquake season. \u201d ) a string of powerful tornadoes , or a geopolitical event like a cyberattack , as Phoenix says , \u201c You get the exponential growth of awful . \u201d\nMatheny says one of the primary worries many forecasters have is just how little we actually know about the world around us . As science and technology advance , we \u2019 re constantly learning about new threats and pushing the boundaries of human interactions with the physical world .\nIt may seem easy now to dismiss scientists on the Manhattan Project who considered the theoretical possibility that the first nuclear test\u2014the so-called TRINITY blast in New Mexico\u2014might ignite Earth \u2019 s atmosphere ( it didn \u2019 t ) or those who worry that the Large Hadron Collider experiment might open a black hole on Earth ( it hasn \u2019 t\u2014so far ) , but there are all manner of unimaginable things that could pose an existential threat to modern society . \u201c It \u2019 s worrisome how many catastrophic risks have been discovered only relatively recently , like supervolcanoes and space weather , \u201d Matheny says . \u201c There \u2019 s a lot we don \u2019 t understand . \u201d\nNo one knew that the Cascadia Subduction Zone even existed half a century ago , and when scientists in the 1980s first posited it was responsible for mega-earthquakes , they were met with skepticism . Now it stands as the nation \u2019 s possible biggest natural disaster-in-waiting of all time .\nThe unknown is particularly challenging for policymakers and business leaders , who are often driven by short-term incentives like elections and shareholders , often causing them to be more reactive than active . \u201c The fact that we don \u2019 t have any large-scale effort to understand existential threats to the U.S. or the world seems like a failure , \u201d Matheny observes . \u201c We \u2019 re already not that great at prioritizing risks that we know about ; we \u2019 re even more negligent thinking about risks that we haven \u2019 t categorized that are over the horizon . \u201d\nMoreover , Gordon says , advances in science leave us exposed to structural challenges we have never even considered . \u201c I always worried about what would happen if we discovered that DNA could be manipulated\u2014what does that do to our legal system ? \u201d she says . \u201c If our adversaries did something that forced us to consider whether anything DNA-wise could be trusted in our legal system , what does that do to our ability to seek justice ? \u201d\nRichard Clarke , a former White House national security official during the Clinton and Bush administrations , proposed in his 2017 book , Warnings : Finding Cassandras to Stop Catastrophes , establishing a \u201c National Warning Office \u201d to work on imagining such risks .
