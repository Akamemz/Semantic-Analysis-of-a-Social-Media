A number of Democrats have also voiced their concerns . In fact , Democrats in the Senate are so skeptical of the White House refusal to involve Congress that Republican Bob Corker may have enough votes to override a deal should the President sign one at the end of June .\nRegardless of bipartisan opposition , the White House is pinning opposition and criticism of the current deal and process on Republicans . The administration is painting Republican concerns as illegitimate while at the same time entertaining the same concerns of `` principled '' Democrats .\n`` My view is that there are a number of members of Congress that have considered this in a principled way .
