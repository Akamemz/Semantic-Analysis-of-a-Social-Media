This ruling is also a moment of profound vindication following months of hysterical commentary from the media and Democratic politicians who refuse to do what it takes to secure our border and our country . \u201d\n\u201c As long as I am president , I will defend the sovereignty , safety , and security of the American people , and fight for an immigration system that serves the national interests of the United States and its citizens , \u201d he added .\nThe ban in its currents form was issued in September 2017 . The administration assessed travel penalties against eight countries , who failed to satisfy basic vetting and information-sharing expectations .\nA coalition of Democratic states and civil rights groups challenged the proclamation , making two basic arguments . They first alleged the sanctions exceeded Trump \u2019 s authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act ( INA ) . The INA , the plaintiffs said , only allows the president to ban the entry of a specific class of dangerous aliens for a limited time . It also provides that the president may not discriminate on the basis of race , religion , or nationality when issuing visas .\nSecond , the challengers claimed that the order was issued to disparage Muslims , in violation of the First Amendment \u2019 s ban on religious favoritism in government policy .\nThe high court rejected both these positions . Roberts explained that the INA \u201c exudes deference to the president in every clause , \u201d meaning that courts should not second-guess Trump \u2019 s national security findings .\nThe law sets just one requirement for the president : he must formally determine that the entry of a certain class of aliens is detrimental to U.S. interests . The majority found the administration easily satisfied this demand , as Trump \u2019 s order is the most comprehensive proclamation ever issued under the INA .\n\u201c The 12-page proclamation \u2014 which thoroughly describes the process , agency evaluations , and recommendations underlying the president \u2019 s chosen restrictions \u2014 is more detailed than any prior order a president has issued under [ the INA ] , \u201d the chief wrote .\nWith respect to the constitutional argument , the Court similarly concluded that its review should be limited given the national security sensitivities the case involves .\nThe ruling also identifies what it sees as significant shortcomings of the plaintiffs \u2019 First Amendment argument . Just eight percent of the world \u2019 s Muslim population is encompassed by Trump \u2019 s sanctions , Roberts noted , and the proclamation itself creates a waiver program open to all affected aliens . Moreover , certain nationals \u2014 like exchange students \u2014 from sanctioned countries are specifically exempted from the entry ban .\nAll told , the majority saw these features as incompatible with a supposed Muslim ban .\nIn a most surprising section of the ruling , the high court explicitly overturned one of its most notorious precedents , Korematsu v. U.S. , a 1944 decision in which a five-justice majority upheld the mass internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II . Sotomayor \u2019 s dissent accused the majority of reviving the logic of the Korematsu ruling , prompting Roberts to expressly overrule it .\n\u201c The dissent \u2019 s reference to Korematsu , however , affords this Court the opportunity to make express what is already obvious : Korematsu was gravely wrong the day it was decided , has been overruled in the court of history , and \u2014 to be clear \u2014 \u2018 has no place in law under the Constitution , ' \u201d the chief wrote , quoting Justice Robert Jackson \u2019 s famous dissent in that case .\nBut Sotomayor was unimpressed , asserting that the Court \u201c merely replaces one \u2018 gravely wrong \u2019 decision with another . \u201d\nThough Kennedy joined the high court \u2019 s majority opinion in full , he wrote separately to chide Trump for disregarding his constitutional oath .\n\u201c There are numerous instances in which the statements and actions of government officials are not subject to judicial scrutiny or intervention , \u201d Kennedy wrote . \u201c That does not mean those officials are free to disregard the Constitution and the rights it proclaims and protects . \u201d\n\u201c An anxious world must know that our government remains committed always to the liberties the Constitution seeks to preserve and protect , so that freedom extends outward , and lasts , \u201d he added .\nThomas also wrote a concurring opinion criticizing the issuance of so-called \u201c universal injunctions , \u201d in which a single federal judge can issue an order that binds the entire government .
