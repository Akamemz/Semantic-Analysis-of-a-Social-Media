Although the Vermont senator ended his 2020 campaign this week boasting a smaller coalition than he \u2019 d assembled four years prior , his resilient hold on a supermajority of voters under 40 \u2014 combined with that cohort \u2019 s exceptionally left-wing views in policy polling \u2014 suggests that the moral arc of the Democratic Party bends toward Sandersism .\nThat arc may have been much shorter had our present nightmare come a bit sooner .

The COVID-19 pandemic foreclosed America \u2019 s path back to some facsimile of the Obama era .

How much more widely might his pitch have resonated in a nation hurtling toward levels of joblessness unseen since the Great Depression ? At each Democratic debate , Sanders \u2019 s rivals shot down his calls for single-payer health care with pledges to preserve the employer-provided coverage that voters know and love ( or at least , tend to express approval of in Gallup surveys ) . How much less effective would these rebuttals have been in a country where millions of workers lose such coverage , along with their jobs , each week ? In Iowa and New Hampshire , the senator \u2019 s exorbitant plans for expanding social insurance and green infrastructure were met with exasperated demands for details on how he intended to offset each cent of new spending .
