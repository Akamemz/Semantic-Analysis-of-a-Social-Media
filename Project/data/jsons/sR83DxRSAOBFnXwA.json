    "content": "President Clinton at a White House ceremony in 1998 ( Win McNamee / Reuters )\nFor Clinton , the real story of the impeachment drama was that he did nothing wrong .\nExcept for a few superficial similarities \u2014 I like my brown liquor , I \u2019 m a \u2588\u2588\u2588 reader , I \u2019 m bipedal \u2014 I fully realize I \u2019 m no Jack Kerouac . But I \u2019 m thinking I \u2019 m gon na do this \u201c news \u201d letter Kerouac-style . I don \u2019 t mean that I \u2019 ll write it drunk ( or rather , too drunk ) or that I \u2019 m going to copy his voice . Rather , I simply mean I \u2019 m going to forgo the normally polished and precise , meticulously organized style of this \u201c news \u201d letter and just go stream-of-consciousness in the grand tradition of Kerouacian \u201c spontaneous prose \u201d and old-fashioned cocaine addiction ( I got ta get home to make the tomato sauce ) .\nRemember last year when \u2014 < checks notes > \u2014 remember this week when Bill Clinton had that awful Today Show interview with NBC \u2019 s Craig Melvin ?\nFirst , as indicated above , it \u2019 s rather amazing how long ago barely five days ago seems .\nSecond , I have to say that the most annoying thing about Bill Clinton \u2019 s performance didn \u2019 t have anything to do with the lies or the narcissism \u2014 it was that something has happened to Bill Clinton \u2019 s mouth . When he talks , he makes these smacking sounds like his mouth is full of spackle or the detritus from a saltine-cracker-challenge fail . It makes it hard for me to concentrate on the words , because all I can hear is his tongue peeling off the roof of his mouth like the wallpaper in a Rangoon brothel .\nTertiarily , Bill \u2019 s still Bill . I won \u2019 t belabor the point because everyone else has . But time after time , Clinton has spun the Lewinsky thing into a story about how he was treated unfairly during this thing that simply occurred while he was president .\nThis is how he put it in his \u201c do-over \u201d interview with Stephen Colbert : \u201c But the important thing is , that was a very painful thing that happened 20 years ago , and I apologized to my family , to Monica Lewinsky and her family , and to the American people . \u201d\nHe uses a version of this locution all of the time . The scandal was a thing that \u201c happened \u201d as if he was not the author of it . It reminds of that scene in Diner where Steve Guttenberg ( \u201c What an actor ! \u201d \u2014 The Stonecutters ) makes his fianc\u00e9e take a football-trivia test to prove she \u2019 s worthy of marriage . If she fails , Gutenberg explains , \u201c it \u2019 s out of my hands . \u201d\nFor Clinton \u2014 both of them \u2014 all of his or her misdeeds were scandals because other people , nefarious forces , Comstocks and prudes , vast right-wing conspiracies , talk-radio critics , et al. , unfairly turned them into scandals . For Clinton , the real story of the impeachment drama was that he did nothing wrong . \u201c I did the right thing , \u201d he said . \u201c I defended the Constitution . \u201d\nYes , that is totally how history will remember that chapter .\nI wonder how many times Bill told one of his paramours : \u201c Lie back and think of the Constitution . \u201d\nSpeaking of history , I particularly enjoyed when Bill snapped , \u201c You think President Kennedy should have resigned ? Do you believe President Johnson should have resigned ? \u201d\nThis is precisely the argument Clinton used on Donna Shalala and the rest of his cabinet the day after he publicly admitted he \u2019 d been lying \u2014 and had forced his cabinet to lie \u2014 about his groping for trout in a peculiar river with an intern for over a year . Here \u2019 s how I put it not long ago :\nWhen Bill Clinton had to \u201c apologize \u201d to his cabinet for playing baron-and-the-milkmaid with an intern and lying about it , he asked if anybody had a problem with it . Donna Shalala foolishly assumed he was being sincere . She chimed in and said she had a problem . He berated her for her effrontery , explaining that her prudish standards would have prevented JFK from being president . And while those of us not ensorcelled by the cult of that charismatic mediocrity might respond , \u201c Yeah , so ? \u201d this was a debate-settling argument for many liberals .\nCorrect me if I \u2019 m wrong , but I was under the impression that the whole premise \u2014 right or wrong ( I think right ) \u2014 of the Me Too movement is that being powerful or even doing good things professionally is no excuse for piggish , exploitative , or abusive behavior . Clinton \u2019 s rhetorical question about Kennedy and Johnson proves that he doesn \u2019 t actually agree with the Me Too movement . Or , to be more accurate , he agrees with it \u2014 so long as it doesn \u2019 t apply to him . Which is just about the purest distillation of Clintonism \u2014 in both its Bill and its Hillary strains \u2014 you could come up with .\nBut speaking of Me Too , I do have a problem with the Today Show interview . I \u2019 ve been following the mainstream media \u2019 s celebration of Melvin \u2019 s \u201c courage \u201d for bringing up the Lewinsky episode . But you know what he didn \u2019 t bring up ? All of the other allegations \u2014 including rape \u2014 against Bill Clinton . If we are to take Me Too seriously , then surely , say , Juanita Broaddrick deserves a hearing , no ?\nAs much as Clinton didn \u2019 t see it that way , focusing entirely on the Lewinsky stuff was a great favor to Clinton , because it allowed him to cite polls and offer his bovine-turd-taco claim that he was \u201c defending the Constitution. \u201d Was he standing up for the Madisonian vision of the constitutional order when he told Broaddrick to put some ice on her lip ?\nStill , the liberal media should be congratulated for trying to resolve their cognitive dissonance . Indeed , I think Bill Clinton is partly correct when he says the press is \u201c frustrated because they \u2019 ve got all these serious accusations against the current occupant of the Oval Office , and his voters don \u2019 t seem to care. \u201d It \u2019 s not just the current occupant of the Oval Office \u2014 but it seems obvious to me that the liberal punditocracy would not be turning on Clinton so much if he weren \u2019 t inconvenient to the anti-Trump narrative .\nAnd since we \u2019 re on the topic of cognitive dissonance and sexual politics , let me refer you to my column today . I \u2019 ll wait while you read it . Okay , for those of you who didn \u2019 t bother , my basic argument is that I think the new Miss America policy of not judging outward beauty \u2014 at all \u2014 is kinda ridiculous .\nIn the 1990s , I used to go to a joint called \u201c Burrito Brothers. \u201d They had great burritos . One day , a friend of mine got the tacos , something that no one had ever dreamed of doing in human history . Fascinated , I asked him , \u201c How are they ? \u201d\nMy friend replied , \u201c Meh . I think there \u2019 s a reason they don \u2019 t call them \u2018 Mexican Food Brothers. \u2019 \u201d I \u2019 ve always used this as an illustration of the idea that organizations should stick to what they are good at , i.e. , what their purpose is .\nTurning the Miss America Pageant into a contest to find the most confident , woke , and earnest young woman regardless of her looks strikes me as a silly idea , along the lines of Burrito Brothers getting into the heating and insulation business .\nAnyway , I was quite honest in the column about my shameful secret : While I \u2019 m not a big fan of pageants , I like looking at very attractive women . More to the point , the charge that Miss America \u201c objectified \u201d women never bothered me much . The point of beauty pageants is to judge beauty . That \u2019 s how they started . Judging people on their earnest wokeness is why we have Oberlin .\nI don \u2019 t celebrate the fact that beauty matters , I simply acknowledge it . It is undeniable that every culture cares about attractiveness , and denying that is simply ridiculous . We shouldn \u2019 t go overboard with it . But thinking that we can just badger people into abandoning sexual desire or notions of beauty strikes me as more than a little totalitarian and entirely idiotic . ( An extreme version of this is the occasional claim one finds in the wokier swamps that heterosexual men who are uninterested in dating transgender women are bigots . )\nI haven \u2019 t done a survey , but it seems that a lot of the people who like to mock and belittle \u201c science deniers \u201d and \u201c creationists \u201d are the very same people who insist ( hetero ) sexual desire , beauty , etc . are entirely socially constructed . I concede that social forces play a significant role \u2014 Reubenesque women were once the standard of beauty and all that \u2014 but I find it bizarre and anti-science to deny that sexual desire is an important part of human nature .\nBut that \u2019 s not the reason I bring all this up . While I was getting into Twitter spats with people denouncing the objectification of women at beauty pageants , a much louder and larger mob was denouncing Rudy Giuliani for daring to judge a porn actress .\nMy client @ StormyDaniels should be celebrated for her courage , strength and intelligence . She is one of the most credible people I have ever met regardless of gender . Period . I would be put her character up against Mr. Giuliani \u2019 s any day of the week . # Basta \u2014 Michael Avenatti ( @ MichaelAvenatti ) June 7 , 2018\nRudy Giuliani is misogynist filth . The thrice-married moral midget has no standing to criticize @ StormyDaniels . Obviously . \u2014 Joan Walsh ( @ joanwalsh ) June 6 , 2018\nIf there is a single industry in all of Christendom that does more to treat women as sexual objects without meaningful agency or dignity , it \u2019 s the porn industry and , relatedly , strip clubs . Yeah , yeah , I get that Stormy Daniels is an assertive , independent businesswoman . And , as I am not a close student of Stormy Daniels \u2019 s particular contributions to this oeuvre , it may be the case that Dripping Wet Sex IV is full of empowering messages for women , but I \u2019 ll remain skeptical until I review the evidence .\nLook , I also get that what Giuliani was doing was quite ugly and dishonest . And I get that he \u2019 s no moral exemplar . And I am happy to concede that I think Daniels is telling the truth . But we are in a strange world where beauty-pageant swimsuit competitions are evil relics of toxic masculinity \u2014 but porn stars are glorious examples of womanhood at its finest .\nAs I was writing this , the news broke about Charles Krauthammer . I knew this was coming ( I got an email about it at the reception for my father-in-law \u2019 s funeral , which was not ideal ) . But I was still unprepared for the reality of it . There will surely be an outpouring of remorse , praise , support , and reminiscence of Charles in the weeks ahead . I don \u2019 t have the emotional energy to even attempt any such thing right now . I started to cry writing a tweet . But I will join the chorus more fully when the time is right . Until then , let me just say that Charles is one of the most impressive and decent people I have ever known . He is a mensch in every sense . And while he is almost never wrong , I hope and pray he is wrong about his prospects . The world needs Charles Krauthammer .\nCanine Update : I feel sheepish following that with a report about my dogs , but Charles is a fan of the G-File ( one of the highlights of my career ) and he is a fan of dogs , so I know he will not object . The beasts were very happy when we came home from Alaska . Some people have surmised that the dogs like the Fair Jessica more than they like me . I think this is irrefutable . I have many theories why , but one factor is probably that she is in charge of their weekly portion of ice cream . The spaniel continues to spaniel . Because the weather was nice for most of this week , I tried to keep them company and work from home in the backyard . The only problem is Pippa and Zo\u00eb have a different idea of \u201c work. \u201d Meanwhile Gracie , the good cat , is much more cooperative ( though she does have high standards when it comes to jewelry ) . Because I \u2019 ve had to be up terribly early several times this week , I pulled the great switcheroo and woke them up .\nI will be in Chicago this Saturday and in Florida next week .
