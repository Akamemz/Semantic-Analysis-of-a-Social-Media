Others who \u2019 ll be there are making it clear that while they don \u2019 t yet back Trump , they want to be in Cleveland if only to support the rest of the Republican Party .\nHouse insiders predict just under 200 Republicans from their 247-member conference will attend . Meanwhile , well over a dozen Senate Republicans are saying \u201c no , thanks \u201d to the Cleveland festivities , which get underway just after Congress left Washington for a seven-week summer recess .\nThe mood won \u2019 t be so dour among Hill Republicans who \u2019 ve been eager to boost Trump and the GOP .\nUpbeat from polls showing a competitive battle for the White House , these GOP officials believe now is the time the fractured party needs to unite after a bruising primary campaign .

It \u2019 s not all just about the next president . So we \u2019 ll come together to talk about national security , for example . \u201d\nSen. Susan Collins , the Maine moderate who \u2019 s also made clear she does not support Trump at this point , echoed Kinzinger \u2019 s message .\n\u201c What seems to have been overlooked this year is the convention is more than just the top of the ticket , \u201d said Collins , who will likewise be in Cleveland . \u201c It \u2019 s about boosting our party from the top of the ticket to the state legislators . \u201d\nReps.

Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire , Marco Rubio of Florida , Roy Blunt of Missouri , John McCain of Arizona , Rand Paul of Kentucky and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania will all be home campaigning .
