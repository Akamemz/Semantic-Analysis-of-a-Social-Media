The president of the Association of Flight Attendants\u2014a major figure in organized labor , who is expected by many to someday helm the AFL-CIO\u2014has been living with the gravity of a global pandemic for much longer than most Americans . \u201c We started working on this issue in January , \u201d Nelson tells me , explaining that airlines \u2019 pulldown of Asia-bound flights during that time immediately slowed her industry \u2019 s cash flow . \u201c If we don \u2019 t get this relief right now , the airlines are going to run out of the ability to provide payroll in two months , if not sooner . \u201d\nNow , Nelson is seeking a bailout for the airline industry . But don \u2019 t call it that , she says , and if she gets her way it wouldn \u2019 t follow any of the contours of what banks and other industries received in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis . She wants federal relief for the airline industry to go directly into the pockets of its employees ; alongside it , she wants a ban on stock buybacks , dividends , and executive bonuses , as well as strengthened union protections that don \u2019 t allow corporations to use any government money to \u201c limp along until they file for bankruptcy . \u201d\nNelson has been in close contact with fellow union leaders in the retail and hospitality industries who are hopeful that her union \u2019 s asks can be a model for other sectors that find themselves similarly cash-strapped during the pandemic . \u201c We have experienced a crisis like this before , and we know that the people with money in control will try to make a crisis work for them , \u201d she says . \u201c If you keep the paychecks going for workers , they can help themselves . \u201d\nFor the last week , industry CEOs and their lobbying arms have been parading in and out of the Oval Office to express worry about what the sudden demand shock of the COVID-19 crisis has done to their bottom lines . Airports have asked for $ 10 billion , and public transportation officials estimate they \u2019 ll need $ 13 billion . The hotel industry seeks a whopping $ 150 billion , and the head of the US Travel Association thinks the travel industry as a whole needs $ 100 billion on top of that . On Wednesday , the Washington Post reported that the Treasury Department was eyeing an estimated $ 200 billion to prop up the airlines and various sectors of the travel industry .\n\u201c We have experienced a crisis like this before , and we know that the people with money in control will try to make a crisis work for them . \u201d\nThese recent scenes at the White House bear heavy similarity to the wake of the 2008 financial collapse , when the banks received massive sums of taxpayer-funded rescue money , and have already drawn the watchful eye of progressive lawmakers . Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ( D-N.Y. ) tweeted that \u201c [ i ] f there is so much as a DIME of corporate bailout money in the next relief package , it should include a reinstated ban on stock buybacks , \u201d the practice of using a company \u2019 s liquid cash to repurchase shares , which typically benefits executives and wealthy investors . Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D-Mass . ) told her Twitter followers that Congress is \u201c not writing blank checks to giant corporations \u201d and shared a list of demands for any company that receives federal money in the coming weeks , including a requirement to keep employees on payroll and the need for a congressional oversight body modeled on the panel she served on in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis .\nIf progressives can \u2019 t stop history from rhyming , they \u2019 re determined to stop it from repeating : If there will be money given to save industries , it will have strings attached . \u201c People need to be prepared to learn the lessons of the past to resist these bailouts , \u201d says Andy Green , the managing director at the left-leaning Center for American Progress , who worked as a staffer on the Senate Banking committee during the 2009 recovery .\nThe downsides to the last major bailout were already in the news this year thanks to the 2020 Democratic primary . Warren premised much of her campaign on that point ; she said \u201c Washington has showered big banks with favors \u201d and released regulatory proposals that made banks fear her candidacy . In nearly every stump speech , Bernie Sanders offered a variation on this theme : \u201c The American people bailed out Wall Street . Now , it is time for Wall Street to come to the aid of the middle class. \u201d And last week , when rumors percolated that the Trump administration would seek a cash infusion for the oil industry to compensate for market downturns , progressives preemptively objected . \u201c Not only is he trying to focus on corporations and , really , corporate interests , but also doing things that are illogical , like trying to bail out [ the ] oil industry that you know are completely unrelated , \u201d Rep. Mark Pocan ( D-Wisc . ) , a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus , told Buzzfeed , comparing the idea to the 2008 crisis .\nIt wasn \u2019 t necessarily that simple . The banks truly were too big to fail , says Amanda Fischer , the policy director for the Washington Center for Equitable Growth , a progressive think tank , who also worked for the House \u2019 s Financial Services committee during the \u2018 08 crisis . Their failure could have deepened the recession , and rescuing them was the only thing to do . \u201c What I think is wrong is how we did it\u2014how we mediated the aid through the banks instead of immediately helping families , \u201d Fischer tells me . \u201c And we did not accomplish enough structural reform to address root causes like inequality , so we walk into the next recession having repeated the same mistakes . \u201d\n\u201c There has to be a better way than draining the company of its money in good times , but asking the taxpayer for money in hard times . \u201d\nFischer says that the lack of structural reforms is what \u2019 s at the root of the economic woes the pandemic has brought upon travel- and transportation-heavy industries . She points to a May 2019 credit analysis of American Airlines\u2014the most recent one available\u2014that calls the airline \u201c one of the highest-leveraged\u2026because of its heavy reliance on debt for repurchasing its shares. \u201d The analysis notes a company policy of repurchasing shares when its cash on hand reaches $ 7 billion , leaving American a small cushion to deal with hard times .\nThe practice is industry-wide : US airlines spent 96 percent of their cash profits on stock buybacks , according to Bloomberg . Thanks to the Trump tax cuts , which left businesses flush with cash , corporate buybacks across the US economy reached a record high in 2018 . \u201c The private sector received a massive bailout in the form of Trump tax cuts in 2017 and deserve zero of a bailout right now , \u201d Green says .\n\u201c American Airlines isn \u2019 t to blame for the pandemic , but the fact that they have been looting the company with buybacks and now have a weaker cushion against loss\u2014the blame \u2019 s on them for that , \u201d Fischer says . \u201c There has to be a better way than draining the company of its money in good times , but asking the taxpayer for money in hard times. \u201d ( In addition to federal assistance , American American airlines is also currently asking banks for a year-long , multi-billion-dollar loan . )\nThis isn \u2019 t to say that money shouldn \u2019 t go directly to the companies themselves . The progressive economists , experts , and activists I spoke with are skeptical of the one-time payments of $ 1,000 or more that the White House and lawmakers of both parties have proposed . AFA \u2019 s Nelson argues that the practice would increase inequity between salaried and hourly wage people , and that it would be better to maintain the income people already receive . \u201c When people have jobs , that also gives them health care , \u201d she adds , \u201c and the government then reduces the number of people it would otherwise have to care for in another way . \u201d\nSo they argue that money should be funneled to industries\u2014but it should go directly to help workers whose incomes are now in jeopardy .
