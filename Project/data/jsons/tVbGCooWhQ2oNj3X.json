''\nTrump has a critical role to play in setting the tone , both rhetorically and in deed . He should immediately reach out to Democratic leaders , and seize upon areas of mutual interest , no matter how modest , analysts say .\nClinton , for her part , acknowledged the need to unite the country and called on her supporters to do their part . `` We have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought , but I still believe in America and I always will , '' she said in her concession speech on Wednesday . `` If you do , then we must accept this result and then look to the future .

He wrote campaign mailers , he says , that were \u201c calmer and express [ ed ] confidence in the voter . \u201d\nBut perhaps the most important voters to ask , \u201c How can the nation heal ? \u201d are those who attended campaign rallies \u2013 because they are among the most engaged and partisan Americans of all .\nIn the weeks before Election Day , we talked to people at rallies featuring Trump , Clinton , and their running mates .\nIs reconciliation even possible ? If so , how ? Whose job is it to lead the way ? What , if anything , can you do personally ?\nSome voters reacted with stunned silence or rueful laughter . In the heat of battle , most warriors are focused on the task at hand , not how life can possibly return to normal \u2013 or even transform into something better .\nSome saw a better future only if \u201c their \u201d candidate won . Clinton supporters believe Clinton will do more to create jobs and keep the country safe . Ditto Trump supporters on Trump .\n\u201c Quite frankly and speaking only for myself , I \u2019 m not sure the nation will heal if Hillary Clinton is elected , \u201d said Rick Williams , the owner of a limousine service in Nashville , Tenn . He was attending a Trump rally in Naples , Fla. , to encourage Evangelical Christians to vote .\n\u201c What keeps me awake is , is there a terrorist slipping in with refugees ? \u201d said Mr. Williams . \u201c Are we killing unborn babies , especially in late term ?

We have to go back to living with each other . \u201d\nAt a Clinton rally in Coconut Creek , Fla. , two days later , campaign volunteer Brenda Williams had plenty to say about Trump supporters . Had she ever been to a Trump rally , just to see for herself ? No . Did she know any Trump supporters ? \u201c Sadly , yes , \u201d she said . Her son-in-law .\n\u201c We go back and forth , \u201d said Ms. Williams , a retired college vice president . \u201c But he \u2019 s young , he doesn \u2019 t know anything . He needs to be educated . Trust me , I will educate him . \u201d\nLinda Feldmann/Staff Brenda Williams is a volunteer for Clinton . Photo taken at Clinton rally in Coconut Creek , FL , on Oct. 25 .\nIs there anything the next president can do to help the nation heal ? Williams \u2019 s answer was immediate : Make it mandatory for every community to have a commission on police-community relations .\n\u201c We need to do it at the grassroots level , and elevate up , \u201d says Williams , who is African American . \u201c Get everyone involved \u2013 I \u2019 m talking black , white , Hispanic , across the board . If we start with that , everything else will fall in place . \u201d\nAlmost by definition , voters see the future through the prism of their own experience . At Liberty University , an Evangelical mega-university in Lynchburg , Va. , freshman Brooke Aaron says that until \u201c everybody comes to God , \u201d the nation will never come back together again .\nHow does that happen ? \u201c You go out and spread the gospel \u201d \u2013 and then you lead by example , she says . \u201c You can say you \u2019 re Christian but if your actions don \u2019 t follow up , then they \u2019 re not going to listen to you . \u201d\nDelia Trost , a Lynchburg resident attending a Mike Pence rally last month , sees societal reconciliation coming from all levels .\n\u201c The next president , whoever that is , will have the burden of uniting this nation , like Obama was supposed to do and did not do , \u201d says Ms. Trost , who immigrated to the US from Mexico many decades ago .\nWhen asked what individuals can do to bring about more societal harmony , she stops short : \u201c Can I tell you something ? I already do that. \u201d Calling herself \u201c blessed , \u201d Trost says she helps people with housing , food , and money , and by connecting them to jobs .\n\u201c That \u2019 s what we need to do in this country , \u201d she says . \u201c They \u2019 re begging for jobs .
