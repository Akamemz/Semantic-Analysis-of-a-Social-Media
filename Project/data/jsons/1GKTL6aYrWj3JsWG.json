    "content": "Mere feet from the US-Mexico border , thousands of asylum seekers have been forced to live in squalid conditions in some of the most dangerous parts of Mexico . They are under threat from drug cartels and dependent on American volunteers for even the most basic necessities .\nThe humanitarian crisis is happening in plain sight , but they \u2019 re still waiting for desperately needed aid . Some migrants are lucky to find housing in shelters , hotels , or rooms for rent , but for more than 5,000 others , only colorful tents and tarps , some held up by only sticks and stones , stand between them and the elements , even as temperatures drop below freezing . The encampments are clustered around bridges linked to US ports of entry along the Rio Grande , where families and children have been waiting for a chance to apply for asylum for months .\nThe Trump administration has touted a nearly 75 percent drop in the number of migrants apprehended at the southern border over the past few months , ever since the numbers peaked at more than 130,000 in May . It \u2019 s the result of policies that force asylum seekers into Mexico , waiting to be initially processed and then waiting again for a decision on their asylum application . As populations swell , both the US and Mexico have left thousands in the camps without basic necessities like clean drinking water and warm clothes \u2014 and at risk for extortion , kidnapping , and rape at the hands of cartels and other criminal actors .\nTrump administration officials have dismissed media reports of the dangers facing migrants waiting in Mexico . The US has continued to send aid to Mexico \u2014 $ 139 million in 2018 \u2014 but otherwise , advocates haven \u2019 t seen any evidence of a US presence on the Mexican side of the border administering aid to migrants . The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s request for comment on US efforts in Mexico .\nThe Mexican government has deployed its National Guard and military to help improve security in some of the border cities , and has also opened a small number of municipal shelters , but is doing little else to protect the migrants who have been relegated to makeshift tent settlements for now .\nNor has the United Nations filled the growing need for humanitarian aid along the border . Its agencies dealing with refugees and migrants , which depend on US dollars to operate throughout the world , are in a delicate political position : The United States , which wrote many of the laws governing the treatment of asylum seekers , now appears to be breaking them .\nUN agencies are working on improving capacity in migrant shelters , sending migrants back to their home countries and informing migrants of their options , but haven \u2019 t delivered aid to the encampments .\nIn the meantime , asylum seekers remain in dangerous , undignified conditions .\n\u201c The moral evasion here is very obvious , \u201d Yael Schacher , a senior US advocate at Refugees International , said .\nThe primary driver of this crisis is that President Donald Trump \u2019 s policies are sending thousands of migrants back to Mexico , where there isn \u2019 t enough safe , temporary housing in which they can stay .\nIn 2018 , US Customs and Border Protection officials started limiting the number of asylum seekers it processes at ports of entry each day . Those waiting had to do so in Mexico , where migrant shelters are at capacity . Many have been forced to sleep on the streets . The amount of names on lists of those waiting to be processed exceeded 26,000 in August .\nOnce they are processed , though , they may quickly be returned to Mexico under the Trump administration \u2019 s \u201c Remain in Mexico \u201d policy , officially known as the Migrant Protection Protocols ( MPP ) . More than 56,000 migrants have been sent back to await decisions on their US asylum applications .\nIn Matamoros , a city of about 500,000 people across the border from Brownsville , Texas , about 2,000 migrants have moved into makeshift tent encampments along the Rio Grande \u2014 so close to the US border that they can show up at the port for processing whenever their names are called .\nMatamoros is a dangerous place : The US State Department has issued a Level 4 \u201c Do Not Travel \u201d advisory for the region due to high rates of violent crime , kidnapping , and robbery .\nThe encampment has grown to house several thousand people . Some tents have been erected on land that has been contaminated with feces because there were no public toilets , raising concerns about E. coli infections . Migrants have no access to running water , leading to poor hygiene and the contraction of rashes and funguses . As flu season ramps up , there are concerns it will spread throughout the camps .\nThe UN High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNCHR ) runs refugee camps in other parts of the world , including major camps for Syrian refugees in Jordan and for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh . The UNCHR typically helps run a refugee camp when countries that have been absorbing large numbers of refugees , usually numbering in the millions , request the organization \u2019 s assistance , Chris Boian , spokesperson for the UNHCR in Washington , DC , said .\nBut UNHCR has nothing to do with these makeshift encampments along the US-Mexico border . It \u2019 s not necessary that the organization run the camps in Mexico because the overwhelming majority of migrants come from Spanish-speaking countries and have a chance to integrate into the local community , according to UNHCR \u2019 s office in Mexico . Instead , the migrants themselves are in charge , with some oversight from the Mexican government .\nEarlier in December , the Mexican government began constructing six large tents over a football field near the bridge to the US port of entry in Matamoros , where they will require asylum seekers living in the tents to relocate .\n\u201c Several thousand families are living in the most deplorable , the most horrid conditions imaginable , \u201d Ursela Ojeda , an attorney with the Women \u2019 s Refugee Commission , said .\nBasic health care services come from US-based nonprofits , including Global Response Management , which are stretched thin . Other volunteers cross the border daily , bringing supplies like bedding and food .\nSometimes , parents try to send their children to the port of entry alone so that US officials will be forced to process them , believing they will be safer in the US than in the camps , Schacher said . Their settlements are so close to the port that they can wave to their children as they cross the border .\nEven when migrants do obtain a spot in a shelter , the availability and quality of shelter space varies .\nThe Mexican government runs a federal shelter in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez , where more than 650 migrants are currently living , according to Taylor Levy , an immigration attorney based in El Paso , which is right across the border . Migrants are technically only allowed to stay there for three weeks at a time , but some exceptions have been made . Though it \u2019 s guarded by the Mexican military , there is little security inside the shelter , leading to reports of sexual violence , she said .\nOf the 15 other private shelters in Ju\u00e1rez , many are located in dangerous neighborhoods \u2014 where migrants are vulnerable to cartel kidnappings \u2014 and in buildings that should be condemned , Levy said . Other migrants live in small rented rooms , in abandoned buildings , and in hotels , which are also frequently raided by kidnappers .\nAlthough they are allowed to study alongside Mexican children , few migrant children go to school in Ju\u00e1rez because their parents are afraid that they will be kidnapped . Save the Children has opened small schools inside some of the shelters .\nThe nonprofit group Team Brownsville has also opened up an informal \u201c Sidewalk School \u201d on a concrete plaza near the bridge in Matamoros , where teachers provide school supplies and brief lessons in math , reading , social studies , geography , music , and English to children stranded there \u2014 but it \u2019 s no substitute for formal schooling .\nThe US has shelters for migrants on the American side of the border that could hold thousands of people . But now that the Trump administration is sending migrants back to Mexico , some of those shelters have been taken over by nonprofits , who use the buildings when they make sandwiches to bring to the camps .\nThe UN is helping build shelters \u2014 but isn \u2019 t running the camps\nAdvocates argue that the ultimate solution is an end to the Remain in Mexico policy , which they say is illegal because US law forbids sending asylum seekers back to countries where they will likely face persecution .\nBut they \u2019 re also wondering why no one is stepping in to offer more humanitarian aid , particularly in Matamoros . The UN has stopped short of deploying humanitarian workers on the ground to manage the tent camps or even to bring migrants basic supplies , like food and bedding . And while UN refugee camps have security measures in place , monitoring who enters and exits the camp , the migrants in Matamoros have no such protections .\nAlthough the UNHCR has expanded its presence to eight offices across the country , including in Tijuana and Ju\u00e1rez , it sends only mobile teams to Matamoros for missions that might last a few days , due to concerns about safety .\nBoth of the UN \u2019 s agencies dealing with refugees and migration have taken some steps to help migrants . The UN \u2019 s International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) , which has historically focused on migration management and not humanitarian protections , funds shelters in Ju\u00e1rez , Tijuana and , more recently , Matamoros . It \u2019 s been able to increase capacity and provide water , sanitation , staffing , and food items as necessary , Christopher Gascon , the chief of IOM \u2019 s mission in Mexico , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . In Matamoros , where shelters are at capacity , the group is working with the local government to identify spaces that could house more migrants .\nThe agency has also assisted 1,167 migrants , many of whom were returned to Mexico under MPP and then decided to go back to their home countries , Gascon said , interviewing them to ensure they would be safe and then placing them on buses , commercial flights , or charter flights for free . If migrants are found to be at risk in their home countries , the agency will refer them to the UNHCR or to the Mexican Commission for Refugee Assistance .\nThe IOM \u2019 s next project is to help migrants who must stay in Mexico on a long-term basis become self-sufficient . The agency plans to help migrants obtain work permits and jobs , find accommodations outside of the shelters , and offer cash assistance so they can pay for rent , food , and some basic household items for a few months , Gascon said .\nThe UNHCR filed an amicus brief with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Innovation Law Lab v. McAleenan case \u2014 a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration \u2019 s Remain in Mexico policy \u2014 emphasizing that the US is bound by international refugee law not to send asylum seekers back to places where they would likely face persecution . Otherwise , the UNHCR has primarily worked to inform migrants of their options in the US and Mexico and to explain how the asylum system works , Josep Herreros , UNHCR \u2019 s protection officer in Mexico City , said . When UNHCR encounters particularly vulnerable asylum seekers , they \u2019 re informally referred to the Mexican authorities .\nThe group has raised concerns with Mexican authorities about ensuring that migrants have access to \u201c dignified reception conditions , \u201d including proper documentation and places to stay while they wait in Mexico , Herreros said . The UNHCR is also helping shelters and NGOs improve their capacity to administer protection and is working on an initiative to help victims of gender-based violence in Mexico .\nHerreros emphasized that Mexico ultimately has to take responsibility for migrants \u2019 well-being : \u201c We are trying to enhance the protection response , but we are not operationally involved in the reception of persons returned by MPP , \u201d he said . \u201c The government of Mexico is in charge of the receptions . \u201d\nThe US hasn \u2019 t administered on-the-ground support to migrants stranded in Mexico . Congress approved a funding bill earlier this year that included aid for additional resources , including medical care and basic necessities , inside the ports of entry , but not on Mexican soil . A spokesperson for the US Agency of International Development said that the organization also has no involvement with the implementation of MPP in Mexico .\nMexico , meanwhile , is under pressure from Trump to treat migration as an enforcement problem , rather than as a humanitarian one . The government wants to avoid antagonizing the Trump administration , but it also simply lacks the capacity to manage such large numbers of migrants .\nAnd the UN faces its own limitations . UNHCR \u2019 s offices in Mexico have traditionally focused on helping migrants who are seeking asylum in Mexico , not in the US , with integrating into Mexican society and finding jobs , Herreros said . They \u2019 re not in contact with US authorities . The agency wasn \u2019 t included in initial discussions between the US and Mexico about the Remain in Mexico policy .\nThe organization recognizes that more needs to be done to offer humanitarian aid and is exploring ways to expand its presence on the border gradually . But UNHCR is also wary of becoming the sole party responsible for ensuring that migrants affected by Remain in Mexico are treated humanely and lawfully , arguing that the Mexican and US governments need to step up .\nWhen it comes to putting pressure on the US government , the organization is in a delicate spot : It \u2019 s heavily reliant on the US to serve over 70 million refugees , asylum seekers , and internally displaced people worldwide . The US contributed about $ 1.67 billion , or about 46 percent of the organization \u2019 s entire budget , this year ( as of September ) . The organization says it is working on tapping new sources of funding among private and public donors . But for now , losing American support could mean risking the well-being of many more migrants worldwide .\nStill , advocates argue , UN agencies could be doing more to provide humanitarian aid to those affected by the policy . They could refer cases to legal service providers and advocate on behalf of migrants . And they could help the Mexican government , other international agencies , and nonprofits to make the camps safer and provide more services .\nIn their absence , nonprofits have been shouldering the bulk of that work .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a humanitarian crisis without a coordinated humanitarian response , \u201d Ojeda said . \u201c We recognize that this is a difficult political situation for UN agencies , but I believe they could be doing more . \u201d",
