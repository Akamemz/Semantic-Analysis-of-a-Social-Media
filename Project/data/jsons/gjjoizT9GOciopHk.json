Rand Paul said there is some room for compromise on immigration with the Obama administration . `` We don \u2019 t agree on the whole comprehensive package with the Democrats , but I \u2019 ll bet you about half of it we agree on , '' Paul said . `` The question is : are we willing to narrow our focus and go after things that we can agree to and get them done , or are we going to stay so polarized that we always have to have our way or the highway ? \u201d Administration officials and others told the Post that there still is a long way to go before any compromise could be reached between the House and Senate , which approved a bipartisan plan to overhaul border-control laws last June . `` It \u2019 s a very big deal , and there \u2019 s a path here that could get it done , '' Cecilia Munoz , the White House \u2019 s director of domestic policy , told the Post.Specifically , Boehner \u2019 s initiative would come in the form of simple statement of principles.The central idea is to put forth separate bills dealing with such issues as : This is far different from the view long held by Obama and Democrats that immigration could be taken up in a single , sweeping bill.But Obama and Democratic leaders have said they are open to the multiple-bill approach favored by Boehner and key Republicans like Sen.
