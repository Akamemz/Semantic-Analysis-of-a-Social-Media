Jeff Flake , R-Arizona `` What we 've seen in prior elections is , you could say until you 're blue in the face : 'That 's not my view . ' But if the head of the ticket , or those running for the head of the ticket , are espousing that view -- it hurts . It really does . ''\nThe anxiety is a sharp departure from the heady days after the 2014 midterm elections , when GOP leaders promised they could govern effectively and present a compelling vision for the country . Despite the largest House Republican Conference since 1928 and an eight-seat Senate majority , Congress is just as divided and gridlocked as it was when the GOP only held the House and Democrats ruled the Senate .\nThose differences will become more pronounced with new House leadership eager to take on President Barack Obama and their Senate counterparts , setting up high-profile fiscal showdowns over the debt limit and budget .\n`` This is a manage-by-crisis town , '' said Sen. Steve Daines , a freshman Republican and former congressman from Montana . `` We 've got to get out of this cycle . ''\nAdding to the fear is the expectation that the already unwieldy GOP presidential race will continue to drag on well into 2016 , showing an ugly side of the party to the American public , just as they have a chance to take over the White House .\n`` If people do n't think you are being respectful or they do n't think you particularly like them , they certainly are not going to be attracted to you or support you , '' said Sen.
