Sanders ' first explicit promise on Thursday to join forces with Clinton to take on the Republicans will help quell concerns among Democrats about divisions in the party .\nEmerging from the White House after a meeting with Obama that lasted more than an hour , Sanders warned that a Trump presidency would be a `` disaster '' and that he would `` work as hard as I can to make sure that Donald Trump does not become president of the United States . ''\n`` I look forward to meeting with ( Clinton ) in the near future to see how we can work together to defeat Donald Trump and to create a government which represents all of us and not just the 1 % , '' Sanders told reporters .\nThe senator thanked both Obama and Biden for showing `` impartiality '' during the course of the Democratic campaign .\n`` They said in the beginning that they would not put their thumb on the scales and they kept their word and I appreciate that very , very much , '' Sanders said .\nHe added that he will monitor a `` full counting of the votes '' in California , where Clinton won the Democratic primary contest on Tuesday .
