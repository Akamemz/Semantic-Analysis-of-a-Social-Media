But with the Ansari essay , published on the website Babe.net , we 've entered new territory .\nThe essay , which author Caitlin Flanagan aptly describes at The Atlantic as `` 3,000 words of revenge porn , '' recounts the story of a 23-year-old photographer who eagerly went on a date with Ansari last September , accompanied him back to his apartment after a rushed dinner out , and then engaged in a complicated series of graphically described and exceedingly awkward sexual interactions with him . Eventually the woman ( given the pseudonym `` Grace '' to conceal her identity ) fled his apartment in tears . The following day , when Ansari texted to say he 'd had a good time , she sent Ansari a text message in which she admitted her discomfort with his behavior the night before , and he rather cluelessly apologized .\nThat , apparently , was it \u2014 until the story of the date appeared online , insinuating that Ansari is guilty of \u2026 well , the story never really says .
