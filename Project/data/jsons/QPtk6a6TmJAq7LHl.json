Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer , President Trump made clear he would be `` proud '' to shut down the government in less than two weeks if he does n't get funding for his border wall .\n`` I 'll be the one to shut it down . I will take the mantle . And I will shut it down for border security , '' Trump told House and Senate Democratic leaders as Vice President Pence sat by stoically .\nThe statement from Trump came in an extraordinary show before the cameras and the press , with minutes of tense back-and-forth with both Pelosi , the likely incoming House speaker , and Schumer , the Senate minority leader .\nDemocratic leaders have made it clear they do n't intend to give the president a victory on funding for his signature border wall , and afterward they released a statement reiterating that `` We gave the president two options that would keep the government open . It 's his choice to accept one of those options or shut the government down . ''\nPelosi told reporters on Capitol Hill at a holiday reception later Tuesday she and Trump had spoken on the phone but there was no response to the earlier offer from her and Schumer . According to an aide , the call was around 4 p.m. and lasted about a minute .\nSpeaking immediately after the meeting , both Schumer and Pelosi thought they had emerged with the upper hand after seemingly baiting Trump into taking the blame if there 's a partial shutdown just days before Christmas .\n`` This Trump shutdown , this temper tantrum he seems to want to throw , will not get him his wall , '' the Senate minority leader told reporters outside the White House .\nThroughout the meeting , Trump kept insisting that much of the wall has already been built ( numerous fact-checkers earlier this year determined it has n't , which Schumer pointed out ) and he has also said that the military can build the rest . In a statement provided to NPR Tuesday evening , a spokesperson for the Department of Defense said `` to date , there is no plan to build sections of the wall . '' But `` Congress has provided options under [ existing law ] that could permit the Department of Defense to fund border barrier projects , such as in support of counter drug operations or national emergencies . ''\nDuring the 2016 campaign , Trump also kept claiming that Mexico would pay to build the wall , but he has since dropped that talking point .\nPelosi insisted during the meeting that the cameras should leave , saying afterward she made such a request because `` we did n't want to contradict the president when he was putting forth figures that have no basis in fact . ... I did n't want to say in front of those people , 'You have no idea what you 're talking about . ' ``\nExcept by making that comment just after leaving the Oval Office , Pelosi was saying just that . She also kept trying to explain to Trump that there was n't enough support even in the GOP-controlled House for his border wall , urging him to accept a continuous funding resolution at the current spending levels , or $ 1.3 billion for a year . But Trump kept interjecting to shift blame , saying a House vote would n't matter since he needs to get to 60 votes in the Senate anyway and that would require help from Democrats \u2014 a frequent complaint of his .\nBack on Capitol Hill , Pelosi told fellow Democratic lawmakers in private that she was `` trying to be the mom '' in the room .\n`` I ca n't explain it to you . It was so wild . It goes to show you : You get into a tinkle contest with a skunk , you get tinkle all over you , '' Pelosi said , according to an aide in the room . `` You ca n't let him take you down that path . But the fact is we did get him to say , to fully own that the shutdown was his . That was an accomplishment . ''\nIn another comment sure to irk the president , Pelosi went even further , saying that Trump 's obsession with the border wall is `` like a manhood thing for him . As if manhood could ever be associated with him . ''\nThe tense exchanges underscored the challenges in the coming two years of divided government . Trump diverted from discussing Democrats ' takeover of the House , choosing to focus on GOP gains in the Senate \u2014 thanks , in large part , to a very Republican-friendly map in the 2018 midterms .\n`` When the president brags that he won North Dakota and Indiana , he 's in real trouble , '' Schumer jabbed .\nThe White House tried to paint a very different picture of the meeting after the fact , with press secretary Sarah Sanders saying in a statement , `` President Trump had a constructive dialogue with Democrat Leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi , '' although `` Major disagreement remains on the issue of border security and transparency . ''\nTrump himself told reporters later on Tuesday that `` believe it or not , I think it was a very friendly meeting . ... I 've actually liked [ Schumer and Pelosi ] for a long period of time , and I respect them both '' and that `` when the press left , we had a fairly long meeting and we really discussed a lot of great subjects . ''\nAnd the president showed no regrets for having said he would own a shutdown if it comes to that .\n`` If we close down the country I will take it , because we 're closing it down for border security , and I think I win that every single time , '' Trump said .\nSpeaking on Capitol Hill , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , acknowledged it had been a `` spirited meeting '' at the White House , but that `` I 'd still like to have a smooth ending here '' and avoid a government shutdown .\n`` I 'm sort of hoping for a Christmas miracle here that we 'll have a level of cooperation that we do n't normally have in getting bills across the Senate floor , '' McConnell said , pointing to not just the government funding bill but the farm bill and a criminal justice overhaul .\nDemocratic resistance to funding the wall may have prompted Trump 's pre-meeting tweetstorm , which over a series of five long tweets seemed to simultaneously concede defeat and declare victory on wall funding .\nTroops have been stationed along the Southern border with Mexico since just before the midterm elections , and while some are being extended through the end of January , other units have been sent home .\n`` He 's talking about reprogramming/transferring funds from other [ Department of Defense ] programs , '' said Stan Collender , a federal budget expert , when asked if he could explain the Trump tweets . `` That would indeed take away resources from other activities .
