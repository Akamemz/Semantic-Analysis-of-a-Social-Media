    "content": "The world reacted with outrage and skepticism Wednesday after North Korea claimed that it had successfully tested a `` miniaturized '' hydrogen bomb .\nThe announcement , which could not immediately be confirmed by outside sources , was made by a state television anchor who read a typically propaganda-heavy statement calling the test a `` perfect success '' that elevated the country 's `` nuclear might to the next level '' and provided it with a weapon to defend itself against the United States and other enemies .\nThe United Nations Security Council quickly announced an emergency meeting scheduled for Wednesday morning .\nHowever , Andrei Lankov , a North Korea expert based in Seoul , South Korea , told Fox News he was `` seriously skeptical '' that Pyongyang had tested a hydrogen bomb . According to Lankov , North Korea would have needed to divert a large amount of scarce funds to construct such a device , saying it would have been `` mission overkill . ''\n`` I believe it did not have the 'signature ' of a Hydrogen bomb , '' said Lankov , who added that he had `` absolutely no doubt '' the blast was an atomic test , the fourth carried out since 2006 in definance of international and United Nations sanctions .\nThe reports fueled bipartisan calls on Capitol Hill for tightened sanctions and more pressure on North Korea .\n\u201c North Korea \u2019 s nuclear detonation claims are a grave provocation and threat to international peace and security , and must be met with firm action and a clear effort to halt Pyongyang 's nuclear ambitions , \u201d Sen.

''\nWashington and nuclear experts have been skeptical about past North Korean claims about H-bombs , which are much more powerful and much more difficult to make , than atomic bombs .
