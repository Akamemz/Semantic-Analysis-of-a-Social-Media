Most striking was the ( 30/55 ) majority deeming Obama 's presidency `` a failure , '' along with the prevailing opinion that he 's divided the country , and his unsightly leadership score . The survey also included a dreadful ( 38/56 ) presidential approval rating on the implementation of Obamacare ; support for the law itself was also underwater , with an outright majority opposed , despite this polling series ' silly question wording that omits any mention of 'Obamacare ' or the 'Affordable Care Act .

Another is that an ongoing parade of unpleasant developments continues to make headlines , including the recent revelation that Healthcare.gov was hacked last month . Apologists can cherry-pick useful data points to try to convince the public that Obamacare is reducing premium costs and driving down costs , but that 's simply not the case . Individual market premiums exploded in 2014 , and are expected to grow by roughly eight percent in 2015 ( with many consumers confronting double-digit spikes ) -- to say nothing of high out-of-pocket costs and narrow coverage networks .
