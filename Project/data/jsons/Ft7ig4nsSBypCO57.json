And we saw a president trying to expand the use of executive power to help push his agenda.\n\nHere are five things we learned Tuesday night:\n\n1. It's still the economy, stupid\n\nIt very well could have been a campaign speech given last year -- the president talking about the need for a balanced approach to deficit reduction, at least four references to protecting the middle class, the need to reignite \"the true engine of America's economic growth.\"\n\nWith the recovery still weak, unemployment at 7.9% and the nation's growth rate shrinking the last three months of 2012, the president and his team know much of his legacy may be dependent on helping reignite the economy.

However, he did not give any ground on what he would accept as an alternative -- setting up the next major fiscal fight with Republicans.\n\n2. Mr. Bipartisan?\n\nFacing hundreds of members of the opposing party, Obama took a decidedly different approach than he did in his aggressive inaugural address.\n\n\"They do expect us to put the nation's interests before party. They do expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can. For they know that America moves forward only when we do so together and that the responsibility of improving this union remains the task of us all,\" the president said early on in the address.\n\nHe even praised some Republicans -- he pointed to how Sen.

Show me the money\n\nProposals he floated would make high-quality preschool available to every child, provide tax credits for businesses to hire and invest, promote more scientific research and development, further shift cars and trucks away from gasoline, and invest in infrastructure. \"Nothing I'm proposing tonight should increase our deficit by a single dime.\" he said. \"It's not a bigger government we need, but a smarter government that sets priorities and invests in broad-based growth.\"\n\nBut White House officials refuse to put a price tag on the programs -- or to reveal how, in fact, they would be paid for. They promised more details when the White House's budget proposal is released in a few weeks.\n\n4. If they won't, I will\n\nThe president demonstrated clearly how he plans to aggressively use executive actions to push policy if Congress thwarts him and he announced action on climate change and cybersecurity.\n\n\"If Congress won't act soon to protect future generations, I will,\" he said. \"I will direct my Cabinet to come up with executive actions we can take, now and in the future, to reduce pollution, prepare our communities for the consequences of climate change, and speed the transition to more sustainable sources of energy.\"\n\nAfter efforts dealing with cybersecurity failed to pass Congress, the president signed an executive order to increase information-sharing and to help the private sector develop standards.

Even presidents can't control the news\n\nWhile the White House tried to build up suspense around what the president would say, as soon as news broke Tuesday afternoon that accused cop-killer Christopher Dorner was believed to be holed up in a cabin in the California mountains, much of the media immediately switched gears.\n\nWhat would have been hours of coverage of what was expected from the speech, what Obama's message might be and discussion of his agenda did not happen.\n\nWould this be another split-screen State of the Union similar to when networks flashed news of the verdict in O.J.
