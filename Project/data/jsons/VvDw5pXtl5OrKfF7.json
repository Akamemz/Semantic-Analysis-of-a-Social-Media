    "content": "The First Amendment makes it unconstitutional for government officials to retaliate against you because they dislike your speech . At the same time , federal law gives you the right to sue state officials for compensation if they violate constitutional rights such as your right to free speech . But on Tuesday , the Supreme Court invented a rule that will often allow police officers to arrest people in retaliation for disfavored speech without liability .\nBy enabling police officers to target viewpoints they dislike with near impunity , the decision could be catastrophic for protesters and the press . The justices , meanwhile , didn \u2019 t even try to ground their decision in the text or history of the statute they were interpreting . Instead , the court was surprisingly frank about its rationale : The justices simply don \u2019 t want police officers to have to defend themselves in court against these types of allegations .\nIn Nieves v. Bartlett , a divided court ruled that individuals can \u2019 t sue police officers for retaliatory arrest if those officers had probable cause to arrest them for any crime , no matter how minor\u2014and that \u2019 s true even if the real reason for the arrest was speech the officers didn \u2019 t like . In other words , if you are jaywalking in violation of a local ordinance , officers can arrest you without fear of liability even if they \u2019 re making the arrest only because you \u2019 re participating in a Black Lives Matter demonstration or wearing a \u201c Make America Great Again \u201d cap .\nBecause local laws are full of minor infractions , like \u201c loitering , \u201d that are frequently violated without incident , police will often have a pretext to arrest people engaged in speech the officers don \u2019 t like . By immunizing such abuse , Nieves may have devastating effects on demonstrators , press photographers , and anyone who wants to exercise their speech rights in public , like the right to film the police or verbally challenge officer misconduct . The power to arrest is a potent tool for suppressing speech because even if charges are later dropped , arrestees must undergo the ordeal\u2014and dangers\u2014of being booked and jailed , and they may have to disclose the arrest on future job and housing applications , among other ramifications .\nCongress long ago recognized that making officers financially liable is the most effective way to deter such misconduct . And that \u2019 s why a federal law called Section 1983 enables lawsuits against state officers for violating constitutional rights .
