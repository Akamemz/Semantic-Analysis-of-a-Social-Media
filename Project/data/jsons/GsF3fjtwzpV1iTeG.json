Today \u2019 s new one sees Trump hanging on for now but also confirms the surge for the dark horse . A key disparity between the two polls is how many Utahns are aware of McMullin \u2019 s candidacy enough to form an opinion . In yesterday \u2019 s poll , that number was 52 percent . In Monmouth , it \u2019 s just 34 percent \u2014 and yet he \u2019 s still managing 20 percent of the vote .

Trump 34 , Clinton 28 , McMullin 20 , Johnson 9 :\nSelf-identified Republicans support Trump over McMullin by a 55 % to 26 % margin , with 6 % supporting Clinton and 5 % supporting Johnson .
