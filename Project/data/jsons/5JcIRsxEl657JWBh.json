Under state law, a legally registered gun owner loses the right to own a firearm when he or she is convicted of a crime or becomes mentally ill.\n\nLast year, state agents seized nearly 2,000 firearms, but implementing the gun seizure program is a painstaking job.

They are all people who at one time purchased firearms legally, but have since run afoul of the law, Yo says. \"Such as maybe a felony conviction, mental health commitment, they received a restraining order, domestic violence restraining order \u2014 some type of a misdemeanor conviction that prohibits them from possessing firearms.\"\n\nBeginning In 2007, California officials began collecting names from court records, medical facilities and lists of known or wanted criminals, then cross-referenced them against the federal instant criminal background check system for gun-buyers.
