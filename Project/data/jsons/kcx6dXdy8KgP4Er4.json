REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nWhat happens next and why Trump is unlikely to be removed from office are both explained here.\n\nWHY IMPEACHMENT?\n\nThe founders of the United States feared presidents abusing their powers, so they included in the Constitution a process for removing one from office.\n\nThe president, under the Constitution, can be removed from office for \u201cTreason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.\u201d\n\nHigh crimes and misdemeanors have historically encompassed corruption and abuses of the public trust, as opposed to indictable violations of criminal statutes.\n\nFormer President Gerald Ford, while in Congress, famously said: \u201cAn impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.\u201d\n\nNo president has ever been removed as a direct result of impeachment. One, Richard Nixon, resigned before he could be removed. Two, Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, were impeached by the House but not convicted by the Senate.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nImpeachment begins in the House, the lower chamber, which debates and votes on whether to bring charges against the president via approval of an impeachment resolution, or \u201carticles of impeachment,\u201d by a simple majority of the body\u2019s members.\n\nThe Constitution gives House leaders wide latitude in deciding how to conduct impeachment proceedings, legal experts said.\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee has conducted an investigation into whether Trump abused his power to pressure Ukraine to launch investigations that would benefit him politically, holding weeks of closed-door testimony and televised hearings before issuing a formal evidence report.\n\nThe Judiciary panel will use the report to consider formal charges that could form the basis of a full House impeachment vote by the end of December.\n\nIf the House approves articles of impeachment, a trial is then held in the Senate. House members act as the prosecutors; the senators as jurors; the chief justice of the United States presides. Historically, the president has been allowed to have defense lawyers call witnesses and request documents.\n\nCAN THE SENATE REFUSE TO HOLD A TRIAL?\n\nThere is debate about whether the Constitution requires a Senate trial. But Senate rules in effect require a trial, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has publicly stated that he will allow one to proceed.\n\nRepublicans could seek to amend those rules, but such a move is politically risky and considered unlikely, legal experts said.\n\nWHAT ABOUT OPENING A TRIAL AND QUICKLY ENDING IT?\n\nThe Senate rules allow members to file, before the conclusion of the trial, motions to dismiss the charges against the president. If such a motion passes by a simple majority the impeachment proceedings effectively end.\n\nClinton\u2019s Senate impeachment trial, which did not end in a conviction, lasted five weeks. Halfway through the proceedings, a Democratic senator introduced a motion to dismiss, which was voted down.\n\nWHAT\u2019S THE PARTY BREAKDOWN IN CONGRESS?\n\nDemocrats control the House. The House comprises 431 members at present, 233 of whom are Democrats. As a result, the Democrats could impeach the Republican Trump with no Republican support.\n\nIn 1998, when Republicans had a House majority, the chamber voted largely along party lines to impeach Clinton, a Democrat.\n\nThe Senate now has 53 Republicans, 45 Democrats and two independents who usually vote with the Democrats. Conviction and removal of a president would require a two-thirds majority. A conviction seems unlikely. Should all 100 senators vote, at least 20 Republicans and all the Democrats and independents would have to vote against him.\n\nWHO BECOMES PRESIDENT IF TRUMP IS REMOVED?\n\nIn the unlikely event the Senate convicted Trump, Vice President Mike Pence would become president for the remainder of Trump\u2019s term, which ends on Jan. 20, 2021.",
