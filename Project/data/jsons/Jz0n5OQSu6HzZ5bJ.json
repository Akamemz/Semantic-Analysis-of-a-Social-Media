And I intend to remain friends with them . Our enemies would love to divide us forever , and I refuse to let that happen . If it does , it will be someone else \u2019 s choice . If all of us refuse to be permanently torn asunder , if all of us refuse to choose to let our strategic and tactical disagreements drive a wedge between us , then we won \u2019 t be torn apart . And when the smoke clears in November , however it goes , we can fight on together .\nNow , I spend a tiny bit of time on Twitter , and it can get intense . People disagree about the proper reaction to the The Donald . Some board the Trump Train , and others want to blow up the tracks and derail it . I think of myself as embracing the least-worst option , pumping on a hand car behind the caboose , occasionally weeping .\nLet me be the first to admit that it boggles my mind when people don \u2019 t see how clearly , unequivocally , and completely correct my position is . Yet , the people who have come to a different conclusion also suffer mind boggling when people don \u2019 t see how clearly , unequivocally , and completely correct they are . It \u2019 s almost like people of good faith can look at the same evidence and come to different conclusions .\nBut it \u2019 s pretty important that we all work to make sure good faith disagreements remain a thing . Now , here are some suggestions on how to be constructive with other conservatives who see things differently .\nRealize You Don \u2019 t Have The Moral High Ground : I \u2019 m doing what I think is morally right and so are you . And I don \u2019 t need lectured about how I \u2019 m not meeting your exacting standards and I \u2019 m pretty certain you won \u2019 t welcome me lecturing you . Plus , if you \u2019 ve suddenly decided that you \u2019 re vastly more moral than everyone else you \u2019 ve been fighting for conservatism alongside for the better part of a decade , then you should also concede that your moral sense is somewhat defective since you only recently noticed that everyone else is terrible .\nStop Trying To Play The America/Vets/Apple Pie/Puppies Card : The \u201c If you [ like/hate ] Trump , then you hate [ America/Vets/Apple Pie/Puppies ] \u201d gambit never works . Who is the guy who is told \u201c You clearly hate your fellow vets ! \u201d who thought , \u201c Gosh , I should totally pull a 180 because some guy on Twitter said that if I don \u2019 t conform to his viewpoint I must hate my fellow vets ? \u201d That sort of nonsense always seems to end up embarrassing the guy who tried to play that card ( Yeah , it \u2019 s snarky \u2013 I didn \u2019 t say being chill was easy ) .\nThese People Did Not Become Terrible Overnight Because They Disagree With You On One Point : I am simply not going to disregard people I \u2019 ve read and listened to for years because we disagree on this one thing . That \u2019 s crazy talk . In fact , I \u2019 m going to read and listen to them more closely because echo chambers where you hear only what you want to hear tend to make you dumb . Look , the guys I disagree with have some good points \u2013 regardless of whether any of them think I have any good points . Ben Shapiro , Jim Geraghty , Jonah Goldberg and Bill Kristol are suddenly wrong about everything because I think they are wrong about one thing ? That \u2019 s an actively stupid notion , and I refuse to embrace it .\nWe \u2019 re Not Purging Anyone : I sometimes hear how various mainstream cliques , clans , crews , and coalition components must be purged from the GOP upon Trump \u2019 s victory/defeat . Nope . Besides the practical problems of actually purging large chunks of the coalition , there \u2019 s the troubling insanity of thinking that subtraction equals addition . So one \u2019 s purging anyone . Now , you can choose to leave \u2013 America \u2019 s a big country with plenty of sulking space .

But I \u2019 m going to try , because it \u2019 s less important that I get the transitory satisfaction of smacking someone around than making it possible for my opponent to be there with me in the fights to come . It doesn \u2019 t mean don \u2019 t disagree \u2013 it means be nice about it .\nHow does this work in the real world ? Let me give you an example . There \u2019 s a guy out there who holds a completely opposite view of the Trump voting strategy than I ( We largely agree on Trump himself ) . To call him # NeverTrump is way too mild ; he \u2019 s against allowing the name \u201c Trump \u201d to ever be uttered aloud again . I won \u2019 t name him , but suffice it to say he is associated with a lesser war college than my own Army alma mater .\nNow , he \u2019 s a solid guy . He says important things . And he \u2019 s come to his conclusions for coherent reasons and after a lot of thought . We interact , and I point out where I think he \u2019 s off base and he returns the favor . Sometimes he gets frustrated with me and vice versa , and when that happens we walk away and chill \u2013 like freaking adults . Oh , and when he \u2019 s unfairly attacked by people sort of on my side , I defend him \u2013 and he does the same for me .\nAnd when November rolls around , regardless of the outcome , I expect we will be able to work together again to try and save our country .\nSure , I get plenty frustrated , especially when someone on Team Conservative floats the electoral air biscuit of voting for Hillary .
