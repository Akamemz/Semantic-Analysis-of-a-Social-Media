Economists estimate that 14 million jobs depend upon NAFTA , but people everywhere often oppose trade because the smaller number of jobs lost is more visible than gradual gains .\nWhat evidence of NAFTA 's failings does the Times offer ? Oddly , the article says `` the workforce has grown . ''\nNot much by American standards , but good for Latin America , and the reporter mentions that Rico got `` a handful of raises . '' Have you gotten `` a handful of raises '' ?\nDespite NAFTA , the `` gap between the nation 's rich and poor persists . ''\nDuh . Trade does n't eliminate wealth gaps\u2014it may increase the gap because the cleverest traders get rich . But since the poor gain jobs and wealth , too , so what ?\nFinally , the clueless Times reporter quotes a Mexican politician and crony capitalist complaining : `` Government has not established policies to protect Mexican businesses . ''\nBut `` protection '' for some businesses is corporate welfare\u2014welfare for the rich . It hurts poor people by raising prices . The Times wants that ? Maybe they 're sucking up to Donald Trump and his friend Carlos Slim , Mexico 's richest crony capitalist , and the Times ' biggest shareholder .\nA front-page story smears David and Charles Koch ( the former of whom is a trustee of \u2588\u2588\u2588 Foundation , the nonprofit that publishes this website )\nFirst , the reporter labels them `` the ultraconservative billionaire brothers . '' Ultra ? Why ultra ? Why conservative even ?\nThe Kochs favor liberal immigration rules , gay marriage , legal drugs , ending racial discrimination in criminal sentencing , fighting in fewer foreign wars and getting rid of government bailouts and favors for businesses , including their own .
