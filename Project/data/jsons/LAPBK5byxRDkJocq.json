But they say that time is running short for Trump to reverse the trajectory of the race before voters \u2019 preferences become locked in .\nThere are only a handful of opportunities left for Trump to impact the race , including the three general-election debates , in which Trump has indicated he intends to participate , though he wants to negotiate some of the details . But some pollsters caution that there is a significant risk that , even by the first debate in late September , the race will be locked in against Trump , who would be on an inexorable path to defeat regardless of how he performs .\n\u201c When you come out of the conventions , the leader in the last 16 elections has not lost the popular vote , \u201d said University of Texas professor Christopher Wlezien , who co-authored the book \u201c The Timeline of Presidential Elections : How Campaigns Do ( and Do Not ) Matter . \u201d\nThere \u2019 s another complication for Trump that candidates trailing historically didn \u2019 t face : the proliferation of early and no-excuse absentee voting over the past decade or so . According to the National Conference of State Legislatures , 37 states allow voters to cast their ballots before Election Day if they wish . And , in some states , the no-excuse absentee ballots are mailed to voters as early as next month .\nThe expiring clock is one reason why dozens of Republicans are appealing to Reince Priebus , the chairman of the Republican National Committee , to shift resources away from Trump now and apply those funds and staff to downballot races . ( The RNC said this weekend that such a decision won \u2019 t be made \u201c until late September or October . \u201d )\nBut Trump likely needs to reverse his deficit sooner than that . Wlezien predicted if Clinton holds onto her current margin over Trump after just one more week of polling \u2014 making it three weeks since the Democratic convention \u2014 she would have a nearly 90 percent chance of winning the election , based on past campaigns .\nAnd there won \u2019 t be much Trump can do about it , he said , because the time period around and immediately following the conventions is when voters make up their minds and rarely waver even as the campaign progresses .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not magical , \u201d Wlezien said . \u201c [ The electorate is ] substantially baked . Not everybody \u2019 s locked in , but there \u2019 s a lot of voters locked in now . \u201d\nStill , there are reasons to suggest that history may not be the best predictor : 2016 has been an outlier election in many respects , and the final 12 weeks of the campaign won \u2019 t be conventional . Trump is a unique candidate , and while he is easily the most unpopular presidential nominee in modern American history , Clinton isn \u2019 t well-liked either .\n\u201c It is not that her voters are in love with Secretary Clinton \u2013 they just dislike her less than they disdain Trump , \u201d Quinnipiac University pollster Peter Brown said last week . Quinnipiac found 45 percent of Clinton backers in three states \u2014 Florida , Ohio and Pennsylvania \u2014 said their support for Clinton was mostly motivated by opposition to Trump . But 56 percent of Trump supporters are mostly driven by scorn for Clinton .\nThen there is the relatively large bloc of undecided voters , a trove of support that could , theoretically , boost Trump 's chances . In the RealClearPolitics average , the combined vote shares for Clinton and Trump in a two-way matchup equal about 89 percent . That \u2019 s consistent with the combined vote share for Gary Johnson and Jill Stein : more than 11 percent in the four-way RealClearPolitics average .\nThat \u2019 s a much higher share of uncommitted voters than other recent elections . In 2012 , President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney combined for about 94 percent in polls about two weeks following the conventions .\nAmong those voters who \u2019 ve committed , though , Clinton has a clear lead : Her margin in most national polls is in the high-single-digits , according to most polling averages . And she leads in all 11 swing states that comprise \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Battleground States project \u2014 including 5 states where Clinton \u2019 s lead is 7 percentage points are greater . Trump would have to sweep the remaining six states \u2014 where Clinton leads , but by smaller margins \u2014 just to force an Electoral College tie .\nSome of these Clinton advantages already appear virtually impenetrable . A CBS News/YouGov poll last week in New Hampshire gave Clinton a 9-point lead , 45 percent to 36 percent .\nBut as CBS News Elections Director Anthony Salvanto explained on \u201c Face the Nation \u201d on Sunday , many of the voters Trump would need to win over in order to come back aren \u2019 t open to voting for him .\n\u201c So , we asked people who are n't voting for Donald Trump , would you consider voting for him ? And among women , with whom he is down almost 20 points anyway , women who are not voting for him , the number who say , yes , they would consider it is zero . And the number who say maybe is 9 percent , \u201d Salvanto said . \u201c So , if you 're at zero in the number of people who will consider you going forward , that just emphasizes what a tough hill it is . \u201d\nSome Trump supporters have questioned the accuracy of the polls that serve as the underpinning for this analysis . Polls of all registered voters , they claim , consistently overrepresent Democratic performance compared to polls of likely voters . Another popular assertion is that Trump backers , fearful to express their support for Trump in a telephone poll , either say they will vote for another candidate or don \u2019 t answer the phone at all . And then there \u2019 s the blanket declaration that the polls are deliberately biased against the Republican .\nThere \u2019 s little evidence for any of these explanations , however . The data suggest moving to likely voters , which some pollsters are already beginning to do , won \u2019 t help Trump like it did for Mitt Romney four years ago . There \u2019 s scant reason to believe that \u201c shy Trump voters \u201d exist : Trump didn \u2019 t out-perform his polls during the primaries , and he isn \u2019 t running stronger in polls that offer an anonymous way to respond , like Internet polls , than in polls with a live phone interviewer . And the idea that a diverse set of pollsters and news outlets \u2014 from NBC News to the Wall Street Journal to Fox News \u2014 would produce polls that deliberately interviewed more Democrats similarly strains credulity .\nFor his part , Trump isn \u2019 t questioning the poll results as he has in the past . Trump , in a series of tweets on Sunday decrying media bias , tacitly conceded that he is trailing in the race .\n\u201c If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and did n't put false meaning into the words I say , I would be beating Hillary by 20 % , \u201d Trump tweeted .\nThe three scheduled debates , with the first set for September 26 on Long Island , loom as the next pre-determined inflection points on the calendar .
