Marco Rubio , R-Fla. , defended himself on Friday as MSNBC anchor Stephanie Ruhle asked him `` why on earth '' he would tweet that journalists found `` glee '' in U.S. coronavirus cases outnumbering China 's .\n`` Some in our media can \u2019 t contain their glee & delight in reporting that the U.S. has more # CoronaVirus cases than # China , '' Rubio tweeted on Sunday . `` Beyond being grotesque , its bad journalism We have NO IDEA how many cases China really has but without any doubt its significantly more than why they admit to .

And I need to understand why on earth you did this . \u201d\nBRET BAIER CALLS OUT CHINA , RUSSIA , NORTH KOREA OVER 'SUSPECT , ' 'SKEWED ' CORONAVIRUS STATS\nRubio replied : \u201c Well , because there are some journalists that were doing exactly what I said . ''\nRubio had tweeted out a series of posts showing journalists mocking the administration and America 's interest in being `` Number 1 . ''\nShe went on to suggest that Rubio was engaging in the same kind of finger-pointing that he condemned in others . Rubio responded by indicating that journalists were threatening national security by trusting Chinese figures .\n`` Yeah , but the difference is that this is an ongoing deal here , with what we 're dealing with right now , '' Rubio said , `` and that is a Chinese propaganda effort to put out that they have handled this perfectly and we have not -- and ... the national security and the national interest of the United States does not stop . ''\nHe added that people were `` taking the Chinese number of 80-something thousand infections and saying , 'look how great they did it and look how bad we 're doing it ' -- and that 's not only wrong , that 's a national security issue . We know that that is a propaganda-influenced effort that they 're undertaking , along with Putin in Russia and even the Iranians . And national security and the national interest of this country does not stop -- that 's an ongoing concern even amidst this crisis . ''\nSkepticism about China \u2019 s numbers has swirled throughout the crisis , fueled by official efforts to quash bad news in the early days and a general distrust of the government . Long lines of people waiting to collect the ashes of loved ones at funeral homes last week revived the debate .\nThere is no smoking gun pointing to a cover-up by China \u2019 s ruling Communist Party . But intentional or not , there is reason to believe that more people died of COVID-19 than the official tally , which stood at 3,312 at the end of Tuesday .\nIn a classified report released to the White House , three U.S. intelligence officers concluded that China has concealed the extent of the coronavirus outbreak in its country , underreporting both total cases and fatalities from the disease .\nBloomberg , which first wrote about the report , cited the officers who they said they alerted the White House last week to Beijing 's misleading numbers .
