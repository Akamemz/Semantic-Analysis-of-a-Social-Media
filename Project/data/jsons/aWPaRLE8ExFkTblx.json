And that cold political reality has turned this state into an unlikely battleground between the Vermont senator and Hillary Clinton .\nSanders recognizes Washington is as close to a must-win as it gets after his disappointing loss in Arizona on Tuesday . With 101 delegates at stake , only New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , and California have more delegates at play after this weekend . If he has any hope of catching Clinton , he \u2019 ll have to start here , in a state where progressive-oriented Seattle sets the tone .\n\u201c If Senator Sanders is ever going to do well , I think it would be in Washington , \u201d explained Gov .

She simply needs to keep it close , to deny Sanders the kind of runaway caucus victory that could dent her 300-plus delegate lead and provide him some desperately-needed momentum going into the April 5 primary in Wisconsin , another state that figures to be receptive to his brand of progressive politics . ( Alaska and Hawaii , much smaller delegate contests , also hold caucuses on Saturday . )\nBut it won \u2019 t be easy to hold Sanders back . According to one analysis , Seattle ranks No . 1 among the 50 biggest U.S. cities for per-capita contributions to his campaign . He \u2019 s got seven campaign offices in the state and has drawn huge crowds in his visits to the Pacific Northwest . While most of the state 's high-profile Democrats are backing Clinton , Sanders has the endorsement of the state \u2019 s largest newspaper , the Seattle Times -- by far his biggest endorsement from a daily publication .\nThe political environment is especially well-suited for Sanders . Seattle , which elected a socialist to the city council last year , is in the midst of ushering in a $ 15 minimum wage . Plus , while the local tech boom has fueled the city \u2019 s emergence as a high-profile Democratic money hub over the last decade \u2014 Hillary , Bill , and Chelsea Clinton have each stopped by for recent fundraisers \u2014 many local Democrats harbor resentment toward party leaders in distant Washington , D.C. over their perceived use of Seattle as little more than an campaign ATM , according to numerous fundraisers and Democratic officials .\nDelegates Remaining : 56 Delegates 2,814 1,893 56 2,382 Delegates Needed for Nomination\nSanders ' final Seattle event on the eve of the caucuses , designed to make a big impression , is one that few other candidates would even contemplate : a rally set for Safeco Field , the Seattle Mariners \u2019 baseball stadium with a capacity of well over 50,000 .\nThe optics of an enormous stadium event , closely followed by a big win in Saturday \u2019 s caucuses , could leave a lasting impression on news coverage of the candidate while the voting calendar goes quiet before the Wisconsin primary .\n\u201c Washington is a place where Senator Sanders is making a stand , \u201d said Jaxon Ravens , chairman of the state Democratic Party . `` [ It \u2019 s ] where he \u2019 s saying : \u2018 This nomination process is not over .

While Sanders has at times derisively referred to the bank as the \u201c bank of Boeing , \u201d he has toned down that criticism in a state where Boeing is the single largest private employer .\nIn coastal and foreign trade-reliant Washington , his railing against multinational trade deals and the Ex-Im bank have n't quite hurt him as much as some Clinton allies had hoped \u2013 the trade debate has taken a different shape here than in the automotive and manufacturing hubs of the Midwest .
