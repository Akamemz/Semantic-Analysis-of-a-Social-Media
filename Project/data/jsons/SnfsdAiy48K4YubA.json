King drew a rebuke from Iowa \u2019 s two Republican senators , House Republicans have said they may take action against the congressman , and other high-profile Republican legislators , such as Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina , have condemned his remarks . The conservative intellectual Henry Olsen warned that the \u201c seeds of bigotry \u201d could take root in the Republican Party , and National Review called for King to be expelled from Congress , declaring that \u201c one of the glories of American history is how we finally shed our shameful racist past . \u201d\nHardly . While it is heartening to see that King \u2019 s antics have finally drawn a unified response of condemnation from the right , the reactions seem to miss the obvious point that there is little daylight between Steve King and the president of the United States , Donald Trump . ( Neither National Review \u2019 s editorial nor Scott \u2019 s op-ed even mentions the president \u2019 s name . )\nBut don \u2019 t take my word for it . In 2014 , as Trump was mulling a run for president , he made an appearance in Iowa with King , calling him a \u201c special guy , a smart person , with really the right views on almost everything , \u201d and noting that their views on the issues were so similar that \u201c we don \u2019 t even have to compare notes . \u201d\nLittle has changed . The president has defended white nationalists ; sought to exploit the census to dilute the political power of minority voters ; described immigration as an infestation , warning that it was \u201c changing the culture of Europe \u201d ; derided black and Latino immigrants as coming from \u201c shithole countries , \u201d while expressing a preference for immigrants from places like \u201c Norway \u201d ; and generally portrayed nonwhite immigrants as little more than rapists , drug dealers , and murderers at every opportunity .\nUnlike King , however , the president has the authority , by himself , to make his views into policy . From his travel ban to his child-separation policy to his revocation of protections for immigrants brought here as children , he has pursued discriminatory policies with a commitment he has shown for few other campaign promises .
