    "content": "( CNN ) Sen. Dianne Feinstein clashed Friday with a group of children over climate change policy , criticizing their requests that she back the Green New Deal , accusing them of presenting an ultimatum and contrasting their inability to vote with her three decades in office .\nThe exchange comes as moderate Democrats grapple with the Green New Deal , a 10-year plan to mitigate climate change championed by progressives such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York .\n`` There 's reasons why I ca n't , 'cause there 's no way to pay for it , '' she says , adding , `` I do n't agree with what the resolution says . That 's part of it . ''\n`` That resolution will not pass the Senate , and you can take that back to whoever sent you here , '' she says , citing that the deal does n't have a single Republican in favor of the proposal and `` the key to good legislation is to tailor something that you write so that it can pass , and you can get a step ahead . ''\nWhen a girl urges her to vote yes anyway , Feinstein replies , `` I may do that ... but it 's not a good resolution . ''\nIn a statement Friday night about the confrontation , Feinstein said she `` always welcomes the opportunity to hear from Californians who feel passionately about this issue and it remains a top priority of mine . ''\n`` Unfortunately , it was a brief meeting but I want the children to know they were heard loud and clear . I have been and remain committed to doing everything I can to enact real , meaningful climate change legislation , '' Feinstein said .\n`` We had a spirited discussion and I presented the group with my draft resolution that provides specific responses to the climate change crisis , which I plan to introduce soon . ''\nThe conversation at times grew heated , especially when Feinstein dismissed the group 's request due to their tone and their youth .\nA young woman tells Feinstein she 's `` looking at the faces of the people who will be living with these consequences '' of climate change .\n`` I 've been doing this for 30 years . I know what I 'm doing , '' Feinstein says . `` You come in here and you say , 'It has to be my way or the highway . ' I do n't respond to that . ''\n`` I 've gotten elected . I just ran , '' she continues . `` I was elected by almost a million-vote plurality , and I know what I 'm doing . So , you know , maybe people should listen a little bit . ''\nIn the video , Feinstein also asks a girl how old she is as the girl says politicians should listen to the people they represent . The girl replies that she is 16 .\nLater , a young woman stresses the need for a climate plan with `` bold , transformative action , '' and Feinstein replies , `` Well , you know better than I do . ''\n`` So I think one day you should run for the Senate , and then you do it your way . But in the meantime , I just won a big election , '' the senator adds .\nWhen Feinstein tries to conclude the meeting , a woman says the children `` have decades of life that they hope to still have , and your leadership is so beautifully , beautifully possible , '' the senator replies , `` That does n't work with me , thank you . ''\nA woman urges the children to read the letter aloud .\nOnce most of the children exit , several women stay and calmly chat with Feinstein . One of them says voting to support the deal is important even though it `` is n't something that 's aimed at passing right now '' and the 16-year-old inquires about internship opportunities in Feinstein 's office .",
