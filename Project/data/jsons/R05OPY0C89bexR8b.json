He was pressed and pushed , the question was rephrased , the audience grumbled , and five times , within a span of a minute and a half , he refused to change his mind .\n`` I fully understand , '' Trump said then of the implications of his decision .\nAfter meeting with the Republican National Committee chairman , Reince Priebus , Trump emerged at his gilded Trump Tower holding up a Sharpie-signed 62-word pledge `` totally pledging '' to support the GOP nominee `` regardless of who it is . ''\nOn Tuesday night , Trump changed his mind again . `` No , I do n't anymore , '' Trump told CNN 's Anderson Cooper when asked if he would continue to support whoever the GOP nominee is . `` We 'll see who it is , '' Trump added . `` I have been treated very unfairly . '' He pointed to the `` RNC '' and the `` Republican Party establishment . ''\nIt was just 27 days ago that all of the Republican candidates were pledging to support the eventual nominee , even if it was Trump . Now , none of them is pledging to support anyone .
