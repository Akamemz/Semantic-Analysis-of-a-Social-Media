Keith Ellison as their new chairman on Saturday , concluding a hotly contested race to lead a battered party as it tries to channel the anti-Donald Trump energy of its base into an electoral rebound .\nPerez defeated Ellison in a 235-200 vote among the Democratic National Committee 's 435 members who cast ballots Saturday .\nIt took two rounds of voting to select a winner after Perez found himself just one vote shy in the first ballot . The five other candidates , who had amassed 13.5 total votes , all exited the race before the second round began .\nIn a victory speech , Perez vowed that Democrats would wage an all-out battle to deny Trump a second term .\n`` We are at a 'where were you ? ' moment in American history : Where were you in 2017 when we had the worst President in US history ? '' he said .\nImmediately after winning , Perez made a quick move to bring Ellison 's supporters into the fold -- appointing Ellison as the deputy chair of the DNC , to cheers and unanimous approval from the crowd .\n`` It 's my honor to serve this party under the chairmanship of Tom Perez , '' he said .\nThe results brought a chaotic close to a race that stretched on for three months .
