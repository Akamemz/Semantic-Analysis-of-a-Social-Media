'' The plan builds upon a framework first introduced by Democrats in January , which would cost an estimated $ 760 billion over five years .\n`` It 's never been partisan and we do n't intend for it to be partisan now , '' Pelosi said .\nPelosi said the cost of the proposal would likely be close to the original figure , plus an extra $ 10 billion to invest in community health centers . The other priorities outlined in the proposal include ensuring access to clean drinking water , investing in expanded broadband service and funding new infrastructure projects . The proposal also includes `` buy American '' provisions to ensure investment in U.S. companies .\nPelosi said the proposal was `` legislatively ready to go , '' but added that the House could not vote on the proposal until it reconvenes in late April .\n`` I think we come back April 20 , God willing and coronavirus willing . But shortly thereafter we should be able to move forward , '' Pelosi said . President Trump extended guidelines telling Americans to stay at home until April 30 earlier this week .\nMr. Trump has also called on Congress to consider an infrastructure package , tweeting on Tuesday that the bill should cost $ 2 trillion `` and be focused solely on jobs and rebuilding the once great infrastructure of our Country !
