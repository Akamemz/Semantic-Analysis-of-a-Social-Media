Now it 's become the unlikely center of protest against a new set of harsh laws enacted by the Islamic country of Brunei .\nThe opulent hotel is part of the Dorchester Collection , a luxury chain owned by the Sultan of Brunei . This week , the tiny , oil-rich southeast Asian country set off a storm of celebrity protests and boycotts by introducing Islamic laws that include death by stoning for gays and adulterers .\nSince last month , 20 events have been canceled at the Beverly Hills property\u2014a loss of about $ 2 million in revenue for the hotel , according to Dorchester . Local politicians and celebrities are also boycotting the nearby Hotel Bel Air in Los Angeles , the hotel 's more subdued sister property .\nBig names like Jay Leno and Ellen DeGeneres are urging boycotts , and the Beverly Hills mayor and council are calling for Dorchester to sell the hotel .\nDorchester , which runs 10 hotels world-wide , is looking to expand globally and has said it is seeking to acquire a luxury property in New York . Hotel analysts say the publicity surrounding protests against the company could complicate efforts to operate a Manhattan hotel , where there is also opposition to the new law .\n`` A Dorchester property in New York would attract the rich , famous and powerful , '' says Sean Hennessey , chief executive officer of Lodging Advisors , a New York-based hotel consulting firm . `` That 's the same sort of crowd that 's upset with Dorchester in L.A . ''\nThe participation of Hollywood 's A-list in the boycott has been painful because the hotel has long been a see-and-be-seen spot to eat , sleep and fundraise . The hotel 's Polo Lounge restaurant is one of this city 's prime power-lunch spots . One event earlier this year attracted stars including Will Smith and Sandra Bullock .\n`` When we heard what was going on in Brunei , we said that does n't fit with our philosophy , '' said Elaine Leader , head of a teen support organization that abruptly moved a fundraising event for 500 people honoring Sony Pictures Co-Chairman Amy Pascal from the Beverly Hills Hotel to the Sony Pictures lot this week .\nBritish billionaire Richard Branson took to Twitter over the weekend to declare that no Virgin employee or Branson family member will stay at Dorchester hotel `` until the Sultan abides by basic human rights . ''\nAnnual events like a `` Women in Entertainment '' breakfast thrown by the Hollywood Reporter in December , and a `` Night Before the Oscars '' fundraiser held by the Motion Picture & Television Fund , have been moved from the hotel .\nDorchester 's London-based chief executive , Christopher Cowdray \u2014who was in Los Angeles this week to speak to hotel employees and customers and to try to quell the political backlash\u2014said that Dorchester 's hotels are a big employer , pay taxes and abide by `` the laws of the countries in which we operate . ''\nHe added that the Brunei Investment Agency , the government investment vehicle that owns Dorchester , is a `` long-term investor '' and that a sale of the Los Angeles-area properties was `` unlikely .

She said she has noticed `` a steep drop '' in visitors . `` It 's not just breaking our hearts\u2026it strangles our livelihood , '' she said .\nMr. Cowdray said the hotel pays $ 11 million in annual taxes to the city . Hotel taxes are expected to contribute $ 34 million to the city in fiscal year 2013-14 , or about 17.5 % of its general fund revenues .\nThe protests have the support of the local arm of Unite Here , a national union representing hotel workers and others in the service industries , which for years has objected to the hotel 's non-union status , and claimed workers have been treated poorly since Brunei 's purchase of the hotel more than 20 years ago . `` Not only is the Sultan anti-gay and anti-woman , he 's also anti-worker , '' said Unite Here Local 11 spokeswoman Leigh Shelton , adding that after Brunei 's government bought the hotel , it closed the property for renovation , fired the workers and refused to call most of them back .\n`` In doing this the dictator effectively broke the workers union and put all the power into the hands of the management team , '' she said .
