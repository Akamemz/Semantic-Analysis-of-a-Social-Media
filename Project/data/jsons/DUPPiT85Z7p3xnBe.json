    "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014 Hillary Clinton has distanced herself from the Obama administration \u2019 s increasingly unpopular handling of international issues , including Syria and Russia .\nThe former secretary of state is much more closely tied to current U.S. diplomatic efforts toward Iran aimed at curbing Tehran \u2019 s nuclear program . Mrs. Clinton has taken credit for initiating secret talks with Iran in 2012 that formed the foundation for negotiations that were recently extended another seven months . In addition , one of her closest foreign-policy advisers at the State Department , Jake Sullivan , remains one of the Obama administration \u2019 s top negotiators with the Iranian diplomats .\nRepublicans are already citing Iran as a likely top foreign-policy issue in the 2016 campaign , when Mrs. Clinton is expected to be the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination . They say the White House is allowing Tehran to use the talks as a cover to weaken Western sanctions and to advance its nuclear program . The White House has said its diplomacy , and an interim agreement reached last year , have capped key parts of Iran \u2019 s nuclear program and rolled it back in some areas .\nIn a July CNN interview , Mrs. Clinton pushed for a U.S. negotiating line that would allow Iran to maintain little to no ability to produce nuclear fuel in the near term . But U.S. diplomats have already conceded in talks that Tehran would maintain thousands of centrifuges used to enrich uranium as part of any final deal .\nShe spoke about the Iran nuclear talks at an event Friday night hosted by the Brookings Institution think tank , saying she supported the extension of nuclear negotiations with Iran . But she displayed distance from the White House \u2019 s policies on Iran .
