It \u2019 s probably going to be worse next time around . \u201d\nMrs. Malbon was attending a rally with the president Thursday in Manchester , as President Obama tried to answer criticism from Republican nominee Mitt Romney \u2014 highlighted again in the GOP challenger \u2019 s first rally after Tuesday evening \u2019 s debate \u2014 that the president lacks an agenda for a second term . The president came to New Hampshire for the first time since Sept. 7 to rally supporters as polls show the race tightening in this small but hotly contested swing state .\nA Suffolk/7News poll on Monday showed the candidates tied at 47 percent . Two weeks ago , Mr. Obama was leading the Republican by an average of 6 percentage points in the Granite State .\nThe Suffolk poll found that voters give the edge to Mr. Romney in fixing the economy , 45 percent to 42 percent , a possible indication that people don \u2019 t have a good idea where Mr. Obama intends to lead the nation in a second term .\nThe president \u2019 s campaign team says his agenda for a second term includes hiring 100,000 more teachers , boosting domestic energy production , creating more manufacturing jobs and cutting the deficit . The president also argues that his second term would be a bulwark against repeating the mistakes made by his Republican predecessors .\nReferring to the recession he inherited four years ago , Mr. Obama told the crowd of about 6,000 in a park in Manchester that his agenda promotes \u201c the policies that are getting us out of this mess . \u201d\n\u201c Unemployment has fallen from 10 percent to 7.8 percent , \u201d the president said . \u201c We need to keep moving forward . We \u2019 ve got more work to do . That \u2019 s why I \u2019 m running for a second term . \u201d\nLeft unmentioned was the fact that the national jobless rate was 7.6 percent when Mr. Obama took office .\nMr. Obama did try Thursday to fill in some of the blanks about his vision for the future , including subsidizing college tuition , increasing U.S. exports , raising taxes on the wealthy and promoting clean energy , which he said would create jobs and \u201c reduce the carbon pollution that \u2019 s heating our planet . \u201d\nWhether or not that qualifies as an agenda that will motivate voters , Mr. Obama \u2019 s message isn \u2019 t always sinking in with the public .\nAsked whether the president has done a good job describing his vision for a second term , supporter Ron Chito of Medford , Mass. , replied , \u201c Not really . \u201d\n\u201c If you \u2019 re a good reader and you know what is going on , then you have a good idea what his policies are and where he \u2019 s headed , \u201d said Mr. Chito , a retired utility worker who attended the rally in Manchester . \u201c Hopefully , we can get more Democrats in the House and Senate so we can get a good jobs bill passed . \u201d\nMrs. Malbon said she will vote for the president , but she expects more gridlock with Republicans in Congress .\n\u201c I \u2019 d like to hear just how he \u2019 s going to accomplish [ a stronger economy ] , \u201d she said . \u201c I was a lot more optimistic four years ago than I am today , that \u2019 s for sure . \u201d\nAs with most of his campaign speeches , the president spent much of his time Thursday criticizing Mr. Romney \u2019 s economic plan , which includes across-the-board tax cuts for all wage earners .\n\u201c He \u2019 s got a tax plan that doesn \u2019 t add up , he \u2019 s got a jobs plan that doesn \u2019 t create jobs , he \u2019 s got a deficit plan that doesn \u2019 t reduce the deficit , \u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201c We don \u2019 t need a sketchy deal . \u201d\nMr. Obama also warned his audience that Mr. Romney would repeal \u201c Obamacare , \u201d saying the result would be to allow insurance companies to charge women more than men for health care coverage .\n\u201c Being a woman \u2019 s not a pre-existing condition , \u201d he said to cheers .\nNational polls show that a significant number of women , who were critical to Mr. Obama \u2019 s victory in 2008 , began moving their support to Mr. Romney after the candidates \u2019 first debate on Oct. 3 . The president said issues such as access to affordable contraception are at stake in the election .\n\u201c We make sure insurance companies are providing women with contraception , \u201d Mr. Obama said , while Mr. Romney \u201c supported legislation that would turn over those decisions to a woman \u2019 s employer . \u201d\n\u201c Do you think , like , [ that ] your boss , or insurance company , or some politician in Washington should get control of your health care choices ? \u201d the president asked . \u201c The health care law we passed puts those choices in your hands . \u201d\nMr. Obama also took a swipe at the Republican-led New Hampshire legislature on women \u2019 s health .\n\u201c You got a state legislature up here that sometimes acts like it knows better than women when it comes to women \u2019 s own health care decisions , \u201d he said . \u201c My opponent \u2019 s got the same approach . Gov . Romney said he \u2019 d end funding for Planned Parenthood despite all the work it does to provide women with mammograms and breast cancer screenings . \u201d\nThe president said he wants to cut the deficit by $ 4 trillion over 10 years , but the solution must include higher taxes on families earning more than $ 250,000 .\n\u201c But I \u2019 m not going to cut things like education , \u201d he said . \u201c I \u2019 m not going to cut research that grows our economy . We can \u2019 t get this done unless we also ask the wealthiest households to pay higher taxes on their incomes above $ 250,000 . \u201d\nThe Romney campaign said the president \u2019 s leadership has failed over the past four years and that the economic future under him would be even bleaker because Mr. Obama won \u2019 t confront the looming \u201c fiscal cliff \u201d of spending cuts and tax increases pending before Congress in January .\n\u201c Today , President Obama only offered Granite State voters more misleading attacks to distract from his failed record , his reckless spending and his inability to present a discernible vision to move our country forward , \u201d said Romney campaign spokesman Ryan Williams .\n\u201c The president is out of new ideas , out of time and out of excuses to explain his failed leadership and broken promises .
