    "content": "The Electoral College officially voted Monday to select Donald Trump as the 45th president as noisy anti-Trump protests across the country fizzled , and Democrats ended up with an even worse black eye in the results .\nMr. Trump defied predictions that he would lose \u201c dozens \u201d of GOP electors in a historic show of discontent . Instead , only two Republicans defected \u2014 less than the four who abandoned Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the Monday vote .\nThe president-elect called his 304 votes \u2014 significantly more than the 270 needed for victory \u2014 \u201c a historic electoral landslide , \u201d said it was bigger than anyone in the media expected and again vowed to be a unifying force in the White House .\n\u201c This election represents a movement that millions of hard working men and women all across the country stood behind and made possible , \u201d he said in a statement . \u201c I will work hard to unite our country and be the President of all Americans . \u201d\nHis assurances , however , have done little to quell unrest among his opponents , underscoring both the fears he himself stoked during his unorthodox campaign and the efforts Democrats are already making to try to dent his legitimacy as president .\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Nov. 8 vote , activists demanded recounts in states where the margin of victory was close .
