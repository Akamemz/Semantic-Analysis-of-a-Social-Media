The contacts were being examined as part of a wide-ranging U.S. counterintelligence investigation into possible communications between members of Mr. Trump \u2019 s campaign team and Russian operatives , they said .\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation , which has been leading the investigation , didn \u2019 t immediately respond to a request for comment . The White House directed requests for comment to the Justice Department .\nBut disclosures about Mr. Sessions \u2019 contacts led quickly late Wednesday to demands that he step aside from any investigation involving the Trump administration , or that he resign for failing to tell the truth during his confirmation hearing .\n\u201c If there is something there and it goes up the chain of investigation , it is clear to me that Jeff Sessions , who is my dear friend , can not make this decision about Trump , \u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R. , S.C. ) , adding that a special prosecutor might be needed .\nMr . Sessions , in a statement placed on Twitter late Wednesday by his spokeswoman , said : \u201c I never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign . I have no idea what this allegation is about . It is false . \u201d\nDuring his confirmation hearing for attorney general in January , Mr . Sessions , a Republican senator from Alabama , testified under oath that he had no contact with Russian officials as a campaign surrogate and never discussed the 2016 election with Russian officials .\nBut Mr . Sessions spoke with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. , Sergei Kislyak , while the Republican National Convention was under way in Cleveland last summer , according to his spokeswoman , Sarah Flores . He also spoke with Mr. Kislyak on another occasion last year , in a meeting in his Senate office , she said , clarifying that the meeting was in person and not on the phone as she had initially said .\nMs. Flores said the contact last July occurred when Mr .

Sessions after his speech at the Heritage Foundation event , including Mr. Kislyak .\nShe said the attorney general wasn \u2019 t aware that his communications have been under investigation .\nDuring his confirmation hearing in January , Mr . Sessions was asked what he would do if any evidence emerged that someone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government during the campaign and said : \u201c I \u2019 m not aware of any of those activities . \u201d\n\u201c I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn \u2019 t have\u2014did not have communications with the Russians , and I \u2019 m unable to comment on it , \u201d he said .\nMs. Flores said Mr . Sessions wasn \u2019 t required to disclose the contacts because they took place in his capacity as a senator , not a campaign official .\n\u201c The attorney general has been very clear that as a senator he had conversations with the Russian ambassador , \u201d Ms. Flores said in a statement . \u201c Last year , the senator had over 25 conversations with foreign ambassadors as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee , including the British , Korean , Japanese , Polish , Indian , Chinese , Canadian , Australian , German and Russian ambassadors . \u201d\nThe focus of the U.S. counterintelligence investigation has been on communications between Trump campaign officials and Russia .

Counterintelligence probes seldom lead to public accusations or criminal charges .\nHowever , the probe , if ongoing , could create a highly unusual and sensitive political dynamic given that the FBI is part of the Justice Department that Mr . Sessions , as attorney general , now leads . Mr . Sessions has only been in office for under a month and the investigation began before he was nominated and approved by the Senate .\nThe FBI \u2019 s role in the investigation into Mr. Sessions \u2019 conversations left the agency \u201c wringing its hands \u201d about how to proceed , said one person familiar with the matter .\nMr. Trump asked for the resignation of his national security adviser , Mike Flynn , after Mr. Flynn misled Vice President Mike Pence over the nature of a conversation he had in December with Russia \u2019 s ambassador to the U.S .\nThe White House has denied any inappropriate interactions between associates of Mr. Trump and Russian officials . Asked during a news conference in February if anyone advising his campaign had contact with Russia during the campaign , Mr. Trump said \u201c nobody that I know of . \u201d\nCommittees in the House of Representatives and the Senate are investigating Russia \u2019 s alleged involvement in the election campaign and possible ties or communication between Russian officials and the Trump campaign .\nRussia has denied interfering in the U.S. election , blaming accusations on American politicians who want to sabotage relations between the two countries .\nSome Republicans contend that the Russia investigations are politically motivated and are being pushed by people who were furious that the FBI , led by its director , James Comey , continued to investigate Hillary Clinton \u2019 s emails late into the 2016 election campaign .
