    "content": "I \u2019 m a professor at a midsize state school . I have been teaching college classes for nine years now . I have won ( minor ) teaching awards , studied pedagogy extensively , and almost always score highly on my student evaluations . I am not a world-class teacher by any means , but I am conscientious ; I attempt to put teaching ahead of research , and I take a healthy emotional stake in the well-being and growth of my students .\nThings have changed since I started teaching . The vibe is different . I wish there were a less blunt way to put this , but my students sometimes scare me \u2014 particularly the liberal ones .\nNot , like , in a person-by-person sense , but students in general . The student-teacher dynamic has been reenvisioned along a line that \u2019 s simultaneously consumerist and hyper-protective , giving each and every student the ability to claim Grievous Harm in nearly any circumstance , after any affront , and a teacher \u2019 s formal ability to respond to these claims is limited at best .\nIn early 2009 , I was an adjunct , teaching a freshman-level writing course at a community college . Discussing infographics and data visualization , we watched a flash animation describing how Wall Street \u2019 s recklessness had destroyed the economy .\nThe video stopped , and I asked whether the students thought it was effective . An older student raised his hand .\n\u201d What about Fannie and Freddie ? \u201d he asked . \u201c Government kept giving homes to black people , to help out black people , white people didn \u2019 t get anything , and then they couldn \u2019 t pay for them . What about that ? \u201d\nI gave a quick response about how most experts would disagree with that assumption , that it was actually an oversimplification , and pretty dishonest , and isn \u2019 t it good that someone made the video we just watched to try to clear things up ? And , hey , let \u2019 s talk about whether that was effective , okay ? If you don \u2019 t think it was , how could it have been ?\nThe next week , I got called into my director \u2019 s office . I was shown an email , sender name redacted , alleging that I \u201c possessed communistical [ sic ] sympathies and refused to tell more than one side of the story. \u201d The story in question wasn \u2019 t described , but I suspect it had do to with whether or not the economic collapse was caused by poor black people .\nMy director rolled her eyes . She knew the complaint was silly bullshit . I wrote up a short description of the past week \u2019 s class work , noting that we had looked at several examples of effective writing in various media and that I always made a good faith effort to include conservative narratives along with the liberal ones .\nAlong with a carbon-copy form , my description was placed into a file that may or may not have existed . Then ... nothing . It disappeared forever ; no one cared about it beyond their contractual duties to document student concerns . I never heard another word of it again .\nThat was the first , and so far only , formal complaint a student has ever filed against me .\nThis isn \u2019 t an accident : I have intentionally adjusted my teaching materials as the political winds have shifted . ( I also make sure all my remotely offensive or challenging opinions , such as this article , are expressed either anonymously or pseudonymously ) . Most of my colleagues who still have jobs have done the same . We \u2019 ve seen bad things happen to too many good teachers \u2014 adjuncts getting axed because their evaluations dipped below a 3.0 , grad students being removed from classes after a single student complaint , and so on .\nI once saw an adjunct not get his contract renewed after students complained that he exposed them to \u201c offensive \u201d texts written by Edward Said and Mark Twain . His response , that the texts were meant to be a little upsetting , only fueled the students \u2019 ire and sealed his fate . That was enough to get me to comb through my syllabi and cut out anything I could see upsetting a coddled undergrad , texts ranging from Upton Sinclair to Maureen Tkacik \u2014 and I wasn \u2019 t the only one who made adjustments , either .\nI am frightened sometimes by the thought that a student would complain again like he did in 2009 . Only this time it would be a student accusing me not of saying something too ideologically extreme \u2014 be it communism or racism or whatever \u2014 but of not being sensitive enough toward his feelings , of some simple act of indelicacy that \u2019 s considered tantamount to physical assault . As Northwestern University professor Laura Kipnis writes , \u201c Emotional discomfort is [ now ] regarded as equivalent to material injury , and all injuries have to be remediated. \u201d Hurting a student \u2019 s feelings , even in the course of instruction that is absolutely appropriate and respectful , can now get a teacher into serious trouble .\nIn 2009 , the subject of my student \u2019 s complaint was my supposed ideology . I was communistical , the student felt , and everyone knows that communisticism is wrong . That was , at best , a debatable assertion . And as I was allowed to rebut it , the complaint was dismissed with prejudice . I didn \u2019 t hesitate to reuse that same video in later semesters , and the student \u2019 s complaint had no impact on my performance evaluations .\nIn 2015 , such a complaint would not be delivered in such a fashion . Instead of focusing on the rightness or wrongness ( or even acceptability ) of the materials we reviewed in class , the complaint would center solely on how my teaching affected the student \u2019 s emotional state . As I can not speak to the emotions of my students , I could not mount a defense about the acceptability of my instruction . And if I responded in any way other than apologizing and changing the materials we reviewed in class , professional consequences would likely follow .\nI wrote about this fear on my blog , and while the response was mostly positive , some liberals called me paranoid , or expressed doubt about why any teacher would nix the particular texts I listed . I guarantee you that these people do not work in higher education , or if they do they are at least two decades removed from the job search . The academic job market is brutal . Teachers who are not tenured or tenure-track faculty members have no right to due process before being dismissed , and there \u2019 s a mile-long line of applicants eager to take their place . And as writer and academic Freddie DeBoer writes , they don \u2019 t even have to be formally fired \u2014 they can just not get rehired . In this type of environment , boat-rocking isn \u2019 t just dangerous , it \u2019 s suicidal , and so teachers limit their lessons to things they know won \u2019 t upset anybody .\nThe real problem : a simplistic , unworkable , and ultimately stifling conception of social justice\nThis shift in student-teacher dynamic placed many of the traditional goals of higher education \u2014 such as having students challenge their beliefs \u2014 off limits . While I used to pride myself on getting students to question themselves and engage with difficult concepts and texts , I now hesitate . What if this hurts my evaluations and I don \u2019 t get tenure ? How many complaints will it take before chairs and administrators begin to worry that I \u2019 m not giving our customers \u2014 er , students , pardon me \u2014 the positive experience they \u2019 re paying for ? Ten ? Half a dozen ? Two or three ?\nThis phenomenon has been widely discussed as of late , mostly as a means of deriding political , economic , or cultural forces writers don \u2019 t much care for . Commentators on the left and right have recently criticized the sensitivity and paranoia of today \u2019 s college students . They worry about the stifling of free speech , the implementation of unenforceable conduct codes , and a general hostility against opinions and viewpoints that could cause students so much as a hint of discomfort .\nIt \u2019 s not just that students refuse to countenance uncomfortable ideas \u2014 they refuse to engage them , period .\nI agree with some of these analyses more than others , but they all tend to be too simplistic . The current student-teacher dynamic has been shaped by a large confluence of factors , and perhaps the most important of these is the manner in which cultural studies and social justice writers have comported themselves in popular media . I have a great deal of respect for both of these fields , but their manifestations online , their desire to democratize complex fields of study by making them as digestible as a TGIF sitcom , has led to adoption of a totalizing , simplistic , unworkable , and ultimately stifling conception of social justice . The simplicity and absolutism of this conception has combined with the precarity of academic jobs to create higher ed \u2019 s current climate of fear , a heavily policed discourse of semantic sensitivity in which safety and comfort have become the ends and the means of the college experience .\nThis new understanding of social justice politics resembles what University of Pennsylvania political science professor Adolph Reed Jr. calls a politics of personal testimony , in which the feelings of individuals are the primary or even exclusive means through which social issues are understood and discussed . Reed derides this sort of political approach as essentially being a non-politics , a discourse that \u201c is focused much more on taxonomy than politics [ which ] emphasizes the names by which we should call some strains of inequality [ ... ] over specifying the mechanisms that produce them or even the steps that can be taken to combat them. \u201d Under such a conception , people become more concerned with signaling goodness , usually through semantics and empty gestures , than with actually working to effect change .\nHerein lies the folly of oversimplified identity politics : while identity concerns obviously warrant analysis , focusing on them too exclusively draws our attention so far inward that none of our analyses can lead to action . Rebecca Reilly Cooper , a political philosopher at the University of Warwick , worries about the effectiveness of a politics in which \u201c particular experiences can never legitimately speak for any one other than ourselves , and personal narrative and testimony are elevated to such a degree that there can be no objective standpoint from which to examine their veracity. \u201d Personal experience and feelings aren \u2019 t just a salient touchstone of contemporary identity politics ; they are the entirety of these politics . In such an environment , it \u2019 s no wonder that students are so prone to elevate minor slights to protestable offenses .\n( It \u2019 s also why seemingly piddling matters of cultural consumption warrant much more emotional outrage than concerns with larger material implications . Compare the number of web articles surrounding the supposed problematic aspects of the newest Avengers movie with those complaining about , say , the piecemeal dismantling of abortion rights . The former outnumber the latter considerably , and their rhetoric is typically much more impassioned and inflated . I \u2019 d discuss this in my classes \u2014 if I weren \u2019 t too scared to talk about abortion . )\nThe press for actionability , or even for comprehensive analyses that go beyond personal testimony , is hereby considered redundant , since all we need to do to fix the world \u2019 s problems is adjust the feelings attached to them and open up the floor for various identity groups to have their say . All the old , enlightened means of discussion and analysis \u2014from due process to scientific method \u2014 are dismissed as being blind to emotional concerns and therefore unfairly skewed toward the interest of straight white males . All that matters is that people are allowed to speak , that their narratives are accepted without question , and that the bad feelings go away .\nSo it \u2019 s not just that students refuse to countenance uncomfortable ideas \u2014 they refuse to engage them , period . Engagement is considered unnecessary , as the immediate , emotional reactions of students contain all the analysis and judgment that sensitive issues demand . As Judith Shulevitz wrote in the New York Times , these refusals can shut down discussion in genuinely contentious areas , such as when Oxford canceled an abortion debate . More often , they affect surprisingly minor matters , as when Hampshire College disinvited an Afrobeat band because their lineup had too many white people in it .\nAt the very least , there \u2019 s debate to be had in these areas . Ideally , pro-choice students would be comfortable enough in the strength of their arguments to subject them to discussion , and a conversation about a band \u2019 s supposed cultural appropriation could take place alongside a performance . But these cancellations and disinvitations are framed in terms of feelings , not issues . The abortion debate was canceled because it would have imperiled the \u201c welfare and safety of our students. \u201d The Afrofunk band \u2019 s presence would not have been \u201c safe and healthy. \u201d No one can rebut feelings , and so the only thing left to do is shut down the things that cause distress \u2014 no argument , no discussion , just hit the mute button and pretend eliminating discomfort is the same as effecting actual change .\nIn a New York Magazine piece , Jonathan Chait described the chilling effect this type of discourse has upon classrooms . Chait \u2019 s piece generated seismic backlash , and while I disagree with much of his diagnosis , I have to admit he does a decent job of describing the symptoms . He cites an anonymous professor who says that \u201c she and her fellow faculty members are terrified of facing accusations of triggering trauma. \u201d Internet liberals pooh-poohed this comment , likening the professor to one of Tom Friedman \u2019 s imaginary cab drivers . But I \u2019 ve seen what \u2019 s being described here . I \u2019 ve lived it . It \u2019 s real , and it affects liberal , socially conscious teachers much more than conservative ones .\nIf we wish to remove this fear , and to adopt a politics that can lead to more substantial change , we need to adjust our discourse . Ideally , we can have a conversation that is conscious of the role of identity issues and confident of the ideas that emanate from the people who embody those identities . It would call out and criticize unfair , arbitrary , or otherwise stifling discursive boundaries , but avoid falling into pettiness or nihilism . It wouldn \u2019 t be moderate , necessarily , but it would be deliberate . It would require effort .\nIn the start of his piece , Chait hypothetically asks if \u201c the offensiveness of an idea [ can ] be determined objectively , or only by recourse to the identity of the person taking offense. \u201d Here , he \u2019 s getting at the concerns addressed by Reed and Reilly-Cooper , the worry that we \u2019 ve turned our analysis so completely inward that our judgment of a person \u2019 s speech hinges more upon their identity signifiers than on their ideas .\nA sensible response to Chait \u2019 s question would be that this is a false binary , and that ideas can and should be judged both by the strength of their logic and by the cultural weight afforded to their speaker \u2019 s identity . Chait appears to believe only the former , and that \u2019 s kind of ridiculous . Of course someone \u2019 s social standing affects whether their ideas are considered offensive , or righteous , or even worth listening to . How can you think otherwise ?\nFeminists and anti-racists recognize that identity does matter . This is indisputable . If we subscribe to the belief that ideas can be judged within a vacuum , uninfluenced by the social weight of their proponents , we perpetuate a system in which arbitrary markers like race and gender influence the perceived correctness of ideas . We can \u2019 t overcome prejudice by pretending it doesn \u2019 t exist . Focusing on identity allows us to interrogate the process through which white males have their opinions taken at face value , while women , people of color , and non-normatively gendered people struggle to have their voices heard .\nBut we also destroy ourselves when identity becomes our sole focus . Consider a tweet I linked to ( which has since been removed . See editor \u2019 s note below . ) , from a critic and artist , in which she writes : \u201c When ppl go off on evo psych , its always some shady colonizer white man theory that ignores nonwhite human history . but \u2018 science \u2019 . Ok ... Most \u2018 scientific thought \u2019 as u know it isnt that scientific but shaped by white patriarchal bias of ppl who claimed authority on it . \u201d\nThis critic is intelligent . Her voice is important . She realizes , correctly , that evolutionary psychology is flawed , and that science has often been misused to legitimize racist and sexist beliefs . But why draw that out to questioning most \u201c scientific thought \u201d ? Can \u2019 t we see how distancing that is to people who don \u2019 t already agree with us ? And tactically , can \u2019 t we see how shortsighted it is to be skeptical of a respected manner of inquiry just because it \u2019 s associated with white males ?\nThis sort of perspective is not confined to Twitter and the comments sections of liberal blogs . It was born in the more nihilistic corners of academic theory , and its manifestations on social media have severe real-world implications . In another instance , two female professors of library science publicly outed and shamed a male colleague they accused of being creepy at conferences , going so far as to openly celebrate the prospect of ruining his career . I don \u2019 t doubt that some men are creepy at conferences \u2014 they are . And for all I know , this guy might be an A-level creep . But part of the female professors \u2019 shtick was the strong insistence that harassment victims should never be asked for proof , that an enunciation of an accusation is all it should ever take to secure a guilty verdict . The identity of the victims overrides the identity of the harasser , and that \u2019 s all the proof they need .\nThis is terrifying . No one will ever accept that . And if that becomes a salient part of liberal politics , liberals are going to suffer tremendous electoral defeat .\nDebate and discussion would ideally temper this identity-based discourse , make it more usable and less scary to outsiders . Teachers and academics are the best candidates to foster this discussion , but most of us are too scared and economically disempowered to say anything . Right now , there \u2019 s nothing much to do other than sit on our hands and wait for the ascension of conservative political backlash \u2014 hop into the echo chamber , pile invective upon the next person or company who says something vaguely insensitive , insulate ourselves further and further from any concerns that might resonate outside of our own little corner of Twitter .\nUpdate : After a discussion with a woman whose tweet was quoted in the story , the editors of this piece agreed that some of the conclusions drawn in the article misrepresented her tweet and the article was revised . The woman requested anonymity because she said she was receiving death threats as a result of the story , so her name has been removed . Unfortunately , threats are a horrible reality for many women online and a topic we intend to report on further .",

It wouldn\u2019t be moderate, necessarily, but it would be deliberate. It would require effort.\n\nIn the start of his piece, Chait hypothetically asks if \u201cthe offensiveness of an idea [can] be determined objectively, or only by recourse to the identity of the person taking offense.\u201d Here, he\u2019s getting at the concerns addressed by Reed and Reilly-Cooper, the worry that we\u2019ve turned our analysis so completely inward that our judgment of a person\u2019s speech hinges more upon their identity signifiers than on their ideas.\n\nA sensible response to Chait\u2019s question would be that this is a false binary, and that ideas can and should be judged both by the strength of their logic and by the cultural weight afforded to their speaker\u2019s identity. Chait appears to believe only the former, and that\u2019s kind of ridiculous. Of course someone\u2019s social standing affects whether their ideas are considered offensive, or righteous, or even worth listening to. How can you think otherwise?\n\nWe destroy ourselves when identity becomes our sole focus\n\nFeminists and anti-racists recognize that identity does matter. This is indisputable. If we subscribe to the belief that ideas can be judged within a vacuum, uninfluenced by the social weight of their proponents, we perpetuate a system in which arbitrary markers like race and gender influence the perceived correctness of ideas. We can\u2019t overcome prejudice by pretending it doesn\u2019t exist. Focusing on identity allows us to interrogate the process through which white males have their opinions taken at face value, while women, people of color, and non-normatively gendered people struggle to have their voices heard.\n\nBut we also destroy ourselves when identity becomes our sole focus. Consider a tweet I linked to (which has since been removed. See editor\u2019s note below.), from a critic and artist, in which she writes: \u201cWhen ppl go off on evo psych, its always some shady colonizer white man theory that ignores nonwhite human history. but \u2018science\u2019. Ok ... Most \u2018scientific thought\u2019 as u know it isnt that scientific but shaped by white patriarchal bias of ppl who claimed authority on it.\u201d\n\nThis critic is intelligent. Her voice is important. She realizes, correctly, that evolutionary psychology is flawed, and that science has often been misused to legitimize racist and sexist beliefs. But why draw that out to questioning most \u201cscientific thought\u201d? Can\u2019t we see how distancing that is to people who don\u2019t already agree with us? And tactically, can\u2019t we see how shortsighted it is to be skeptical of a respected manner of inquiry just because it\u2019s associated with white males?\n\nThis sort of perspective is not confined to Twitter and the comments sections of liberal blogs. It was born in the more nihilistic corners of academic theory, and its manifestations on social media have severe real-world implications. In another instance, two female professors of library science publicly outed and shamed a male colleague they accused of being creepy at conferences, going so far as to openly celebrate the prospect of ruining his career. I don\u2019t doubt that some men are creepy at conferences \u2014 they are. And for all I know, this guy might be an A-level creep. But part of the female professors\u2019 shtick was the strong insistence that harassment victims should never be asked for proof, that an enunciation of an accusation is all it should ever take to secure a guilty verdict. The identity of the victims overrides the identity of the harasser, and that\u2019s all the proof they need.\n\nThis is terrifying. No one will ever accept that. And if that becomes a salient part of liberal politics, liberals are going to suffer tremendous electoral defeat.\n\nDebate and discussion would ideally temper this identity-based discourse, make it more usable and less scary to outsiders. Teachers and academics are the best candidates to foster this discussion, but most of us are too scared and economically disempowered to say anything. Right now, there\u2019s nothing much to do other than sit on our hands and wait for the ascension of conservative political backlash \u2014 hop into the echo chamber, pile invective upon the next person or company who says something vaguely insensitive, insulate ourselves further and further from any concerns that might resonate outside of our own little corner of Twitter.\n\nUpdate: After a discussion with a woman whose tweet was quoted in the story, the editors of this piece agreed that some of the conclusions drawn in the article misrepresented her tweet and the article was revised. The woman requested anonymity because she said she was receiving death threats as a result of the story, so her name has been removed. Unfortunately, threats are a horrible reality for many women online and a topic we intend to report on further.",
