    "content": "Reinaldo Flores , an unemployed transit worker in his 50s , walks through the streets of Cerro , one of Havana \u2019 s poorest neighborhoods . The street is flanked by once-grand buildings in faded shades of blue , green , and orange .\nIn some ways , it \u2019 s a typical day for Mr. Flores : he \u2019 s looking for work . But for him and tens of thousands of others across Cuba , today is also dramatically different .\nIt \u2019 s the first day in his life his president \u2019 s named something other than Castro .\nCuba \u2019 s National Assembly , a group of more than 600 handpicked politicians who run unopposed , nominated the island \u2019 s next president this week . Vice President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel , the only candidate put forth , will be Cuba \u2019 s first leader in nearly 60 years who wasn \u2019 t part of the revolution that overthrew US-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista and installed a Communist government on the island . Mr. D\u00edaz-Canel is also the first leader in nearly 70 years who isn \u2019 t part of the armed forces .\nThe changing of the guard \u2013 after decades of leadership by Fidel Castro and 12 years under his brother Ra\u00fal \u2013 is significant . But , observers say , it \u2019 s largely symbolic . In a centralized system that works on a \u201c one state , one party \u201d principle of entrenched revolutionary values , the rise of a new head of state without direct ties to the Castros \u2019 uprising is more likely to lay the groundwork for future change than create big waves in the short term .\nCuba \u2019 s economy is struggling . Vital benefactors like Venezuela are distracted by their own crises , there \u2019 s little foreign investment , infrastructure is crumbling , and the dual currency system is increasingly burdensome . These are issues observers say need to be tackled head on . Although Cuba \u2019 s \u201c old guard \u201d is nominally clearing the way for a new generation of leadership on the island , Ra\u00fal Castro is still top dog in Cuba \u2019 s Communist Party and armed forces , unlikely to give D\u00edaz-Canel much wiggle room to create significant changes anytime soon .\n\u201c If the situation Cubans are living doesn \u2019 t improve , the political changes will be in vain , \u201d Mr. Flores says of the historic transition of power .\nWhile many in the United States view a non-Castro Cuban president as a chance to shed some of the historic baggage that \u2019 s held back relations between the two nations , in Cuba there \u2019 s less optimism . Most are wondering what they can expect \u2013 or if they should expect anything at all .\n\u201c The change in government doesn \u2019 t leave us with a lot of hope , but it does leave us with a big question : What is going to happen to Cuba ? \u201d says Boris Gonz\u00e1lez Arena , a journalist for the local news site Diario de Cuba .\nIrene Perez/Cubadebate/Reuters Cuba 's former President Raul Castro ( center-left ) and former First Vice-President Miguel Diaz-Canel ( center-right ) arrive for a session of the National Assembly in Havana , Cuba , on April 18 , 2018 . Mr. Diaz-Canel was sworn in to replace Mr. Castro as president on Thursday .\nCuba has changed significantly under Ra\u00fal Castro \u2019 s two presidential terms . He did what for many was the unthinkable : warming ties with the United States , allowing private micro-businesses and entrepreneurship to blossom , and doing away with exit visas required for Cubans to leave the island . But he was still a Castro , lending him a certain cachet , and many question whether D\u00edaz-Canel will have the same support for policies that push against the grain of the revolutionary project .\nCuba \u2019 s economy is weak , with many outside economists pointing to 2016 as a full-blown recession . Sugar harvests were devastated by hurricane Irma , and US tourism dollars that prop up the self-employed are flagging . The dual currency is creating imbalances in human capital , with those working in the tourism sector earning significantly more than highly-trained doctors or engineers .\nThe first task for D\u00edaz-Canel will be getting the economy back on track , but just how radically he can approach the problems is at question \u2013 if he has a different approach in mind , to begin with .\n\u201c We have to consider that more likely than not [ D\u00edaz-Canel ] was chosen as the next leader because he \u2019 s like-minded \u201d with the Castro generation , says Gustavo Flores-Mac\u00edas , an associate professor at Cornell University who specializes in Latin American politics . In a video leaked last year , D\u00edaz-Canel is seen lambasting the US and emphasizing the same hardline ideology as his Castro predecessors , accusing dissidents and independent media of subverting the state .\nOn Thursday , Castro said he expected the new leader to serve two five-year terms as president and take over for him as head of the Communist Party when Castro steps down in 2021 \u2013 the date many here view as the more realistic gateway to change by a new generation of leaders .\nCuban blogger Regina Coyula , who was born just before Castro \u2019 s 1959 rise to power , hasn \u2019 t written anything about the presidential transition on her widely read blog , \u201c La Mala Letra \u201d ( \u201c Bad Handwriting \u201d ) .
