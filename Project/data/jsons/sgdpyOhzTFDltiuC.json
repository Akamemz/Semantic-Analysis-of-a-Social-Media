The tragedy is that while America has been binge-watching this made-for-TV spectacle , many have failed to notice how this election has shifted the ground beneath their feet .\nThere are few places where the political landscape is turning to quicksand as quickly as McDowell , the poorest county in West Virginia .\nA forlorn place dotted with shuttered coalmines and abandoned homes , McDowell was once a Democratic heartland but is quickly shifting allegiance \u2013 Barack Obama won there in 2008 , but Mitt Romney took it by a wide margin in 2012 .\nThis year , it was the county in which Trump won his highest percentage of primary votes . There are more than 3,000 counties in the US \u2013 none voted for Trump as overwhelmingly as McDowell , where he secured 91.5 % of the vote .\nHow can it be that a tax-avoiding billionaire who flies around in a gold-plated private jet is most popular in a place where more than half the population lives off donations from a food bank ?\nOne reason is that there is hope in his promise \u2013 dismissed by energy experts as unrealistic \u2013 to revive a coalmining industry that is no longer profitable . \u201c We \u2019 re going to put the miners back to work , \u201d he promised 12,000 people at a rally in West Virginia days before the state \u2019 s primary . \u201c We \u2019 re going to get those mines open . \u201d\nBut the roots of Trump \u2019 s popularity in places such as this precede his candidacy ; indeed , they have been decades in the making .\nDemocrats in McDowell have lost faith in their party , which has run the local government their entire lives and controlled the White House for most of the past quarter-century .\n\u201c It \u2019 s our own fault , \u201d said Martin West , the local sheriff , a Democrat who will vote for Trump . \u201c You keep voting for people that never come to assist you . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s our own fault . You keep voting for people that never come to assist you Martin West , sheriff in McDowell , West Virginia\nThe combined presidencies of Bill Clinton and Obama have done little to arrest soaring inequality in America , and some would argue both presidents accelerated it .\nThe situation in McDowell , by almost every measure , has gotten progressively worse throughout that period .\nLife expectancy \u2013 the starkest gauge of all \u2013 has declined continually since 1981 . The high rate of suicide and the impact of the opioid epidemic have combined to put McDowell \u2019 s rates of mortality on par with Ethiopia .\n\u201c None of us are that blind to think that Trump is going to save all of us , \u201d said Brian Harrison , a coalminer who switched from Democrat to Republican eight years ago . \u201c But at least there \u2019 s some hope . \u201d\nHe added of Trump : \u201c I think he \u2019 s more for the working person than Hillary is . \u201d\nThere is evidence of blue-collar Democrats fleeing to Trump this election in other pockets of the industrial rust belt , including battleground states such as Pennsylvania , Wisconsin , Michigan and New Hampshire .\nClinton still looks poised to win those states , all of which Obama won in 2008 and 2012 . But even if Trump loses these places , his candidacy has peeled back the bandage to reveal Democratic heartlands reeling from industrial decline .\nDemocrats might reassure themselves that Trump \u2019 s populist candidacy will not be easily repeated \u2013 that no conventional Republican will abandon free-market principles , as the real estate mogul has done , to embrace protectionist trade policy .\nBut Trump \u2019 s appeal in parts of the country where manufacturing jobs have been outsourced overseas is not always connected to his specific opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership or denunciation of China \u2019 s currency manipulation .\nMany voters just seem to appreciate his acknowledgment that towns and cities that were once booming are now in decay .\n\u201c People don \u2019 t understand trade policies , \u201d said Jos\u00e9 Arroyo , who has been working with the United Steelworkers to stem the exodus of Democratic voters around Youngstown , an Ohio city surrounded by abandoned , crumbling factories .\n\u201c What they do understand is that they used to work at a place that paid them $ 80,000 a year , and now they \u2019 re working two jobs to make $ 30,000 a year . \u201d\nOhio is one of the Obama states that Trump does look likely to win , in part through his appeal in places such as Youngstown to white , working-class voters without a college degree who previously identified as Democrats .\n\u201c I used to call myself and others robot voters , \u201d said Leo Conway , a union worker and Democrat voting Republican for the first time in his life . \u201c It \u2019 s the definition of insanity , \u201d he said of his previous party loyalty . \u201c You keep putting the same people in the same job and expect a different outcome . \u201d\nI met Conway at a Republican picnic in Ohio \u2019 s Mahoning County , known as ground zero for these crossover voters . But he was not drawn to Trump \u2019 s economic message so much as his muscular military rhetoric and his anti-establishment appeal . In fact , barely anyone mentioned the area \u2019 s industrial decline , which was most acute in the 1980s .\nInstead , I heard people complain that illegal immigration is out of control , law and order is unraveling in the inner cities and government assistance is creating a lazy , welfare-dependent underclass .\nThere is often a racial connotation to all of these grievances , one that Trump has exploited , sometimes explicitly , but more often than not through an ugly brand of dog-whistle politics that has stoked racial tensions .\nThose surfaced during my interview with Trump \u2019 s local campaign chair , Kathy Miller , who was forced to resign when we broadcast her comments .\n\u201c If you \u2019 re black and you haven \u2019 t been successful in the last 50 years , it \u2019 s your own fault , \u201d Miller said . \u201c You had all the advantages and didn \u2019 t take advantage of it .

It\u2019s not our fault, certainly.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there was any racism until Obama got elected,\u201d she added. \u201cWe never had problems like this.\u201d\n\nHow backlash could affect the ballot\n\nEight years after the election of the first black president, some have framed Trump\u2019s rise as some sort of \u201cbacklash\u201d by a silent majority of mostly white men who resent their fading political power.\n\nThere could be some merit to that analysis, but there seems to me an equal if not greater counterweight from the many people who feel offended and even threatened by the Republican nominee.\n\nMost of America is not in decay, and its increasingly diverse population creates a built-in advantage to any Democrat seeking the White House.\n\nThe challenge for Clinton was always going to be reconvening the broad coalition of millennials, college-educated voters and minorities that twice helped elect Obama.\n\nClinton, hamstrung by controversy, especially over her use of a private email server for government business, has struggled to articulate a positive vision of the future that could inspire these voters.\n\nThe conversations I have had in supermarkets, churches and county fairs have made plain that while many voters see Trump as an almost comical liability, their concerns with Clinton take a more somber tone.\n\nShe has frequently been described to me as untrustworthy, corrupt and uncaring, the epitome of a rotten political establishment.\n\nI\u2019ve seen neighborhoods across America, from the affluent suburbs of Waukesha, Wisconsin, to Denver\u2019s sprawling suburbs, where well-kept lawns are dotted with \u201cHillary for Prison\u201d yard signs.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where she belongs,\u201d said Bob Howe, who had one such sign outside his hunting lodge in Maine. \u201cFrigging lying, cheating, thieving.\u201d\n\nIn the face of such distrust, Clinton\u2019s greatest asset has turned out to be her opponent, the only major presidential candidate in modern history who has been more unpopular than her.\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s extraordinary campaign has scrambled the electorate, winning unusual allies while giving many of the people I met a reason to vote.\n\nThere was the woman in an Ohio restaurant who showed me a picture of her two-year-old son who is partially deaf and has cerebral palsy.\n\n\n\nHer voice shook and her eyes welled with tears as she recounted the rage she felt watching Trump mocking a disabled person on TV. \u201cI\u2019m not a violent person,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I just felt like strangling him.\u201d\n\nThere was the barber in Milwaukee, a city reeling from a succession of police shootings of black men, offended by Trump\u2019s claim African Americans like him have \u201cnothing to lose\u201d. \u201cWe have a lot more to lose,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cOur lives.\u201d\n\nAnd there are the many people like Carmela Perez, a Mexican American who has raised seven children in a mobile home on the outskirts of Las Vegas and has dedicated the past four months to electing Clinton.\n\nIf the polls are correct, it is people like her \u2013 Latinos and women \u2013 who are poised to support the Democratic nominee in record numbers this election.\n\nPerez took a leave of absence from her job washing dishes at the MGM casino to join Clinton\u2019s army of ground operatives in Nevada after she heard the Republican nominee insult Mexicans.\n\nShe said Trump\u2019s comments about women steeled her determination, canvassing for Clinton six days a week in the desert heat. By election day, she will have knocked on 5,000 doors.\n\n\u201cFor me, this is personal,\u201d Perez said. \u201cI feel very offended, wounded. He stabbed me in my guts.\u201d",
