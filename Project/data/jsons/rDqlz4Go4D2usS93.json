    "content": "Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren took the rare step Monday of releasing DNA test results examining her possible Native American ancestry , in apparent response to persistent criticism from President Trump and other Republicans .\nThe results , as shared with The Boston Globe , reportedly reveal \u201c strong evidence \u201d the Massachusetts senator had a Native American ancestor dating back six to 10 generations . At the same time , the report could embolden critics by showing only trace amounts of that heritage -- which Republicans have charged she used to advance her career at Harvard .\nAccording to the analysis , if Warren \u2019 s great-great-great-grandmother were Native American , she would be considered 1/64 Native American . Should Warren \u2019 s ancestor date back 10 generations , she would be only 1/1,024 Native American . ( The newspaper originally pegged the figures as 1/32 and 1/512 , but in a correction that did n't do Warren any favors , later added a note saying , `` Due to a math error , a story about Elizabeth Warren misstated the ancestry percentage of a potential 6th to 10th generation relative . The generational range based on the ancestor that the report identified suggests she \u2019 s between 1/64th and 1/1,024th Native American . '' )\n`` To put that in perspective , Warren might even be less Native American than the average European American , '' Republican National Committee Deputy Communications Director Mike Reed said in an email , while saying this would `` not give you the right to claim minority status . ''\nBut as Warren mulls a presidential run in 2020 , her Senate re-election campaign produced a video playing up the results .\nIn it , Warren says : \u201c The president likes to call my mom a liar . What do the facts say ? \u201d\nStanford University Professor Carlos D. Bustamante replies : \u201c The facts suggest that you absolutely have Native American ancestry in your pedigree . \u201d\nBustamante , according to the Globe , authored the six-page report and conducted the analysis after Warren released a sample of her DNA to a private lab in Georgia over the summer . Warren did not use a commercial service for her DNA analysis , according to The Globe , but rather Bustamante , who is on the scientific advisory board for Ancestry . He also worked on projects for other commercial services like 23andMe .\nBustamante found that \u201c the vast majority \u201d of Warren \u2019 s family tree is European , but added that \u201c the results strongly support the existence of an unadmixed Native American ancestor ... in the range of 6-10 generations ago . \u201d\nWarren has been repeatedly criticized by Trump over her heritage claims\u2014including last week at a rally , when he once again used his \u201c Pocahontas \u201d nickname for her .\n\u201c I \u2019 ve got more Indian blood in me than Pocahontas , and I have none , \u201d Trump said . \u201c Hey , I have high cheekbones too , maybe I \u2019 m Indian . \u201d\nOver the summer , Trump said that if Warren did mount a presidential run in 2020 and the two faced off in a general election debate , he would offer $ 1 million to her favorite charity on the spot if she took a DNA test to prove her Native American heritage .\nThe DNA results report could , at least , eliminate that as a line of attack .\nTrump , though , brushed off Warren 's DNA test when asked about it Monday morning , while claiming he never made the million-dollar offer ( he did , at a rally over the summer ) .\n`` Who cares ?
