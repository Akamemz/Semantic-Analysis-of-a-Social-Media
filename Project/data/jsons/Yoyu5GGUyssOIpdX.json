Two blasts hit the international airport ; another struck a metro station . Belgium issued a Level 4 alert , denoting `` serious and imminent attack . ''\n`` What we feared has happened \u2014 we were hit by blind attacks , '' Prime Minister Charles Michel said at a midday news conference Tuesday . At a later news conference , Michel said Belgium will defend its liberty and values , and he stressed the importance of returning to normal life in Brussels as fast as possible .\nHours after the blasts , Belgian federal police tweeted an image of a man suspected of being involved in the bombing , and asked the public , `` Who recognizes this man ? ''\nWearing a jacket and hat , the man is seen in an image taken by a surveillance camera at the airport . Authorities say they are actively seeking him . The image is similar to a wider photograph of the same man alongside two other men , all three of them pushing luggage carts . Officials say that the other two men , both in black , may have acted as suicide bombers ; Belgian media outlets have noted that each of them wears a single glove which , those outlets say , might hide a trigger for a bomb .\nAs of 4 p.m. local time , the Belgian Crisis Center reported that at least 10 people had died and 100 were wounded in the attack at the Zaventem airport , and that 20 people died at the Maelbeek metro station , where some 130 were wounded .\nISIS has claimed responsibility for the attacks , in a statement released via the Amaq News Agency , a group that 's been linked to the militant extremists . The statement blames Belgium for participating in the fight against ISIS and says that `` several '' fighters detonated explosive belts at the airport and train station .\nAccording to media reports , Belgian federal prosecutors say a house search later in the day , in the Brussels neighborhood of Schaerbeek , `` led to the discovery of an explosive device containing among other things nails . '' Investigators reportedly also found chemical products and an Islamic State flag .\nNPR 's counterterrorism correspondent Dina Temple-Raston says that investigators have discovered additional detonators , ISIS flags and other such materials over the past week in raids across Belgium .\nFrench President Francois Hollande said `` terrorists struck Brussels , but it was Europe that was targeted \u2014 and all the world that is concerned . ''\nThe number of dead and wounded could rise , as Belgian emergency agencies are focused on responding to those in need . Information is still emerging about this attack , and some reports may later prove inaccurate . Here 's what we know so far :\nA suicide attacker struck around 8 a.m. local time , according to a federal prosecutor . The explosions hit near the departure gates , collapsing ceiling panels and shattering glass windows . The blasts sent smoke billowing from the airport and set off a panic as people ran from the airport with whatever they could carry .\nA video from nearby in the terminal that 's been aired on Belgian broadcaster VRT shows travelers cowering as dust and smoke fill the air and sirens blare . We 'll warn you : The video contains a profanity and may be stressful to watch .\nThe facility was evacuated and closed , with emergency crews looking after the wounded and security personnel gathering any evidence that might provide details about those responsible .\nThe attack began after a burst of gunfire and yelling in Arabic , according to Belgian media outlets .\nNBA Hall of Famer Dikembe Mutombo was at the airport . He shared a photo on Facebook and wrote , `` God is good . I am in Brussels Airport with this craziness . I am fine . ''\nAround 9 a.m. local time , an explosion struck a metro train in or near the Maelbeek station , causing chaos close to the European Union headquarters in the city 's center .\nThe station is about 7 miles from the airport . Images of the aftermath of that attack show people running for safety along the tracks through a darkened and smoke-filled tunnel , after trains were halted .\nTo clarify information that went out in an NPR news alert earlier this morning : There have been at least three explosions \u2014 two at the airport and one at a train station .
