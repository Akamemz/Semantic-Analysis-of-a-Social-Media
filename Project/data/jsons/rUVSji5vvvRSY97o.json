''\nThat probe and a previous investigation were marked by `` a series of misguided strategies , tactics , errors in judgment and management failures '' that allowed hundreds of weapons to reach Mexican drug cartels , the Justice Department 's independent inspector general concluded .\nWithin minutes of the report 's release , Justice announced rthat former acting ATF chief Kenneth Melson was retiring and another official , Deputy Assistant Attorney General Jason Weinstein , had resigned .\nWeinstein and Melson were among 14 people who `` bore a share of responsibility for ATF 's knowing failure in both these operations to interdict firearms illegally destined for Mexico , and for doing so without adequately taking into account the danger to public safety that flowed from this risky strategy , '' the report states . Weinstein failed to pass along key information about the flawed tactics being used in Fast and Furious , while Melson and other ATF officials did n't properly supervise the probe , the report states .\nThe report referred them and another 12 officials in Washington and the ATF and U.S. attorney 's offices in Phoenix to Justice officials to determine `` whether discipline or other administrative action '' was required .\nJUST WATCHED Resignations after Fast & Furious report Replay More Videos ...

The resulting investigations discovered similar tactics in a 2006-2007 operation dubbed `` Wide Receiver , '' also run out of Phoenix .\nRevelations that ATF agents watched suspected gun traffickers cross into Mexico with weapons purchased at U.S. gun shops outraged lawmakers . Larry Alt , one of the ATF agents who blew the whistle on the operation , told CNN that it was `` egregious '' that agents were watching people transfer guns to people who were handing them over to the cartels , `` and we were not taking an enforcement action . ''\n`` I would say that the persons responsible for this case ... at the field level , the division level , and the headquarters level and as far as it went into the Department of Justice , should be held accountable for any decision that they made that allowed these guns to go out on the street unmonitored , '' Alt said .\nMaking matters worse , the Justice Department initially denied guns were being allowed to `` walk '' across the border , only to have to formally retract that statement in December 2011 .

In a written statement on the findings , Holder said the inspector-general 's report upholds `` what I , and other Justice Department officials , have said for many months now '' -- that the tactics used pre-dated the Obama administration and that Justice Department leaders did n't try to hide the facts from lawmakers .\n`` It is unfortunate that some were so quick to make baseless accusations before they possessed the facts about these operations -- accusations that turned out to be without foundation and that have caused a great deal of unnecessary harm and confusion , '' Holder said . `` I hope today 's report acts as a reminder of the dangers of adopting as fact unsubstantiated conclusions before an investigation of the circumstances is completed . ''\nBut Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley , who brought ATF whistleblower complaints to the department 's attention in early 2011 , said the report `` reaffirms virtually everything '' that congressional investigators turned up .\n`` It 's clear that both the ATF and the Justice Department failed to provide meaningful oversight of Operation Fast and Furious , '' Grassley said in a written statement . Those agencies `` ignored warnings from employees '' and refused to acknowledge how bad the problem was until after months of congressional pressure , he said .\nAnd Grassley said the report inaccurately lets Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer `` off the hook '' regarding a February 2011 letter to Congress that denied guns were being allowed to cross the border . Along with the statement , Grassley released e-mails he said contradict the report .\nBreuer acknowledged last November he had learned that guns were allowed to `` walk '' to Mexico , and apologized for not informing other senior Justice Department officials .
