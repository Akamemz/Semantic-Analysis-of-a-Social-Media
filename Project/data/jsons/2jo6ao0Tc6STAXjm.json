She is identified as ' H ' in most of the messages .\nBut that is unlikely to happen , and in some ways , the initial release of 300 emails -- from a total of 30,000 that Clinton gave the State Department to be made public in the coming months -- repeats a pattern familiar from the string of controversies and scandals that have dogged Bill and Hillary Clinton over the years .\nThat 's because her actions create plenty of fodder for critics to stoke suspicion and raise questions about her decisions and motives -- not to mention what some view as a penchant for secrecy in using a personal server in the first place .\nIt 's a vulnerability Republicans are already seeking to exploit by drawing comparisons to the era of dramas that scarred her husband 's presidency -- from the row over her financial dealings in the so-called Whitewater affair to the firing of White House travel office aides through Bill Clinton 's impeachment after an affair with an intern .\nSenior Republican leaders , including Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus , are meanwhile trying to build a narrative that the email episode , added to questions about the financing of the Clinton family philanthropic foundation , is symptomatic of a pattern of obstruction and resistance to transparency from the Democratic power couple .\nHe accused them of habitually try to play by a `` separate set of rules '' than other politicians .\nOne of the former first couple 's oldest critics , GOP presidential candidate and former Arkansas Gov . Mike Huckabee , put the email flap down to an endemic culture of scandal in Washington .\n`` We expect these charades and masquerades in USSR -- not the USA , '' Huckabee said in a statement .\nStill , to the likely frustration of Republicans who have been chasing the Clintons for decades , there does n't seem to be sufficient evidence in this first group of emails -- covering the period around the death of American ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens and three other Americans in U.S. government facilities in Benghazi in 2012 -- to prove legal wrongdoing .\nClinton asked her former department to release the emails back in March , after a furor erupted when it emerged that she used a private account , not a government one , while secretary of state .
