Bowe Bergdahl was being held captive at various times \u2014 down to how many gunmen were guarding him \u2014 but special operations commanders repeatedly shelved rescue missions because they didn \u2019 t want to risk casualties for a man they believed to be a \u201c deserter , \u201d sources familiar with the mission plans said .\nCommanders on the ground debated whether to pull the trigger on a rescue several times in recent years , according to one of the sources , a former high-level intelligence official in Afghanistan , who said the conclusion each time was that the prospect of losing highly trained troops was too high a price to pay for rescuing a soldier who walked away from his unit before being captured by the enemy .\nA second source told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the rescue operation plans were \u201c high risk \u201d and became even less attractive in recent months when officials in the Pentagon \u2019 s Joint Special Operations Command grew convinced that the Taliban and the militant Haqqani network , whose operatives were holding Sgt . Bergdahl , were eager to cut a deal for his release .\n\u201c Joint Special Operations Command always had the rescue mission on the table and it was entirely under their ownership , but the big question centered on whether Bergdahl was somebody you risk lives for when you still have time and space to maneuver diplomatically , \u201d said the source , a high-level congressional aide , who , like the former intelligence official , spoke only on the condition of anonymity .\nThe aide also said there was frustration among some on Capitol Hill that the Obama administration had botched an opportunity to exert leverage over the Taliban , particularly since the U.S. military could have used force to secure Sgt . Bergdahl \u2019 s release .\n\u201c The prisoner swap was being built up as the only option that was available . But there \u2019 s been knowledge of the general vicinity of where Bergdahl was , down to how many guys were guarding him , \u201d said the aide .\nThe catch , the aide added , is that special operations commanders and others at the Pentagon never sought approval for the rescue mission from the White House because they believed in the pursuit of a diplomatic deal .\nThe aide said military officials in Afghanistan spent recent months pushing for a stronger deal than was ultimately struck , but were \u201c superseded \u201d by the White House and State Department . The aide would not comment on what the parameters of a \u201c stronger \u201d deal may have looked like , beyond saying they would have involved the Pakistani government .\nThe former intelligence official who spoke with The Times corroborated that assertion but declined to offer further details , saying only that the deal turned out the way it did because \u201c the administration wanted to close the door on this no matter what the price was . \u201d\nSeparately , the former official said , \u201c Military commanders were loath to risk their people to save this guy .
