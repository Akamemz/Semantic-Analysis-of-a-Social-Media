    "content": "President Trump headlined a jam-packed rally in Wildwood , New Jersey , on Tuesday night , hours after his attorneys wrapped up their opening arguments in his Senate impeachment trial -- and minutes after sources told Fox News that Republicans do n't have the votes yet to block additional witnesses who could extend the proceedings .\nAn elevated level of enthusiasm was evident in the larger-than-normal crowd sizes inside and outside the Wildwoods Convention Center , and Fox News spoke to several attendees who had been waiting more than 24 hours to ensure they would be seated .\n`` While we are creating jobs and killing terrorists , the congressional Democrats are obsessed with demented hoaxes , crazy witch hunts , and deranged partisan crusades , '' Trump said . `` We will make sure they face another crushing defeat in the next election . ''\nHotels ordinarily closed for the winter were open for business and largely sold out . Bars and restaurants offered drink specials like the `` MAGA-Rita '' and the `` subpoena-colada '' -- bringing to life what was normally a ghost town in the cold days of January on the Jersey Shore .\n`` We have tens of thousands of people outside , '' Trump said to chants of `` Four more years ! '' and other cheers . `` If anyone would like to give them your place , please let us know . ''\nTrump campaign manager Brad Parscale said that the campaign had received 158,632 requests for tickets at the event , including 92,841 distinct signups , and had identified a total of 73,482 voters -- 10.4 percent of whom did n't vote in 2016 , and 26.3 percent of whom were self-described Democrats .\nThe president , again and again , touted the `` blue-collar boom '' in the economy -- including historically low unemployment , rising wages especially among low-income workers , and soaring markets .\n`` Earnings for the bottom 10 percent are rising faster than earnings for the top 10 percent , for the first time ever , '' Trump said . `` Since my election , the net worth for the bottom half of wage-earners has increased by 47 percent , three times faster than the increase for the top one-percent . Median household income is at an all-time high ; for President Bush , in eight years it was $ 450 . Under President Barack Hussein Obama , for eight years , it was $ 975 . ... Under your favorite president , and when you include the tax cuts , the regulation cuts ... under President Trump , for three years , the number is almost $ 10,000 -- and it 's going up . That 's a big difference . ''\nTrump added : `` The United States is now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world . We do n't need anybody else 's energy anymore . It 's so nice . '' The U.S. recently achieved energy independence and became the top producer of crude oil , though it has reportedly been the largest petroleum producer since 2012 and natural gas producer since 2015 .\nDemocrats , by contrast , would `` demolish '' the U.S. economy , Trump said , noting that their health care plans -- including proposals to pay for the health care of illegal immigrants -- simply were too expensive and inefficient .\n`` We are saving your health care while the Democrats are trying to take away your health care , take away your doctors , '' Trump said .\nTouting his administration 's recent victory in a key Supreme Court case on the so-called `` public charge rule , '' Trump remarked , `` We will now finally be able to enforce federal law and ensure that those seeking admission to our country are able to support themselves financially and not abuse taxpayer-funded programs . ''\nHe continued , `` On no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly betrayed the American people than the issue of immigration . ''\nTrump also hit Democrats for largely opposing restrictions on even late-term abortion , saying , `` every child is a sacred gift from God . '' Trump recently became the first president to speak at the pro-life March for Life rally in Washington .\n`` I got it done , and I mean I solely got it done , '' Trump said to applause later , referring to the passage of his landmark criminal justice reform bill . `` You have to thank yourself , because nobody else is going to do it . ''\nThe event in blue New Jersey was the capper on a busy day , which also included the historic unveiling of a new Middle East peace plan and a Los Angeles Times report that California Sen. Dianne Feinstein was considering a vote to acquit the president . Feinstein later said she was `` misunderstood , '' and an Axios report accused the Times of having the story `` backwards . ''\nThe chaos unfolded with the backdrop of looming Iowa caucuses next week , marking the first big milestone of the 2020 presidential campaign .\nTrump was holding the rally along the beach in Wildwood in support of New Jersey Rep. Jeff Van Drew , who flipped to the Republican party last month after opposing House Democrats ' impeachment of the president .\n`` We are privileged to be joined tonight by a courageous leader who left the Democrat Party because he has had enough of their extremism , enough of their socialism , enough of their vile hoaxes and scams , '' Trump said .\n`` This year , this very year is a flashpoint election , '' Van Drew said after Trump 's introduction . `` Are we going to allow ourselves just to be like any other nation in the world , or are we going to keep America great ? ''\nVan Drew said at the event that there had been approximately 175,000 requests for seats at the venue , which typically holds 7,500 .\nThe setting for the rally was atypical for Trump : a Jersey Shore city where people camped out overnight on the beach to get a spot in line for the rally being held at a boardwalk convention center . Campaign officials touted the raucous crowd , one that did not have many chances to see Trump in person and may draw in voters from the nearby battleground state of Pennsylvania .\nLocal reports also showed the lines started forming Sunday afternoon and had grown to hundreds by early Tuesday morning .\n`` Welcome to 2 am the night BEFORE [ a Trump ] rally !

Although Trump 's acquittal by the Republican-controlled Senate is all but assured , his team has tried to minimize the political damage .\nAnd , the president apparently was hoping to use impeachment to motivate his political base and independents disenchanted with impeachment to turn out in greater numbers this fall .\nJay Sekulow , one of his lawyers , used his time before the Senate to offer a list of attacks against Trump 's perceived foes \u2014 from ousted FBI agents to secret federal courts \u2014 and to highlight what he saw as politically driven maneuvering by the Democrats to oust the president .\n`` Danger , danger , danger , '' he told senators . `` That 's politics . You 're being called upon to remove the duly elected president of the United States . That \u2019 s what these articles of impeachment call for . ''\nWhite House counsel Pat Cipollone , also part of the defense , added : `` What they are asking you do is to throw out a successful president on the eve of an election , with no basis , and in violation of the Constitution .
