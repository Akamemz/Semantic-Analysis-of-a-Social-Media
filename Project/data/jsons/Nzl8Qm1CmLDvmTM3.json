He then joined a nonprofit organization to push for reform from outside government .\nIn addition to special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s ongoing Russia investigation , the president \u2019 s son-in-law , Jared Kushner , is embroiled in several scandals , as are a number of Trump \u2019 s Cabinet members . Trump has refused to divest himself of his private business interests , and he \u2019 s now mired in a potential cover-up scandal involving Stormy Daniels and $ 130,000 of hush money , which might have violated campaign finance laws .\nBut there are good reasons to think that many of Trump \u2019 s supporters won \u2019 t care about any of this . This , at least , is the argument that Jan-Werner M\u00fcller , a political theorist at Princeton , makes in his 2016 book What is Populism ?\nAccording to M\u00fcller , populists like Trump succeed by pushing a form of tribal politics that elevates an in-group ( \u201c the real people \u201d ) over an out-group ( \u201c the others \u201d ) . As long as ethical breaches help the in-group , or are believed to do so , they simply won \u2019 t matter to committed supporters .\nI reached out to M\u00fcller to talk about how populists govern , why they \u2019 re able to get away with abuses of power , and why protests against them often backfire .\nYou \u2019 ve argued that cronyism and corruption aren \u2019 t a problem for certain kinds of populist leaders . Why is that ?\nThis isn \u2019 t an empirical finding , so I can \u2019 t prove this is the case , but the general idea is that in many populist regimes , what seems so obviously like corruption is , in fact , a strength for these leaders . It \u2019 s easy to look at abuses of power and assume that it will hurt the person committing the abuses , but it \u2019 s not that simple .\nWhat might look like corruption or cronyism to neutral observers is seen by the supporters of populists as doing the right thing for the right people , the \u201c real people. \u201d This is why the tribal appeal of populism is so crucial . Populist leaders thrive on distinctions between \u201c us \u201d and \u201c them , \u201d between \u201c the people \u201d and \u201c the establishment . \u201d\nSo when populist or authoritarian leaders like Hungary \u2019 s Viktor Orban or Poland \u2019 s Andrzej Duda or Turkey \u2019 s Recep Tayyip Erdogan seem to be violating norms and imposing antidemocratic measures , their supporters interpret these moves as necessary for their survival . It might be illegal or unusual or extreme , but as long as it \u2019 s being done for the in-group , supporters aren \u2019 t bothered by it .\nOne possibility is that supporters of populists simply don \u2019 t see a lot of these things as acts of corruption . It \u2019 s just their guy or their leader doing what he has to do in a broken system . Another possibility is that because we live in a highly fragmented media landscape , people simply don \u2019 t know what \u2019 s going on . So it \u2019 s not that people are condoning corruption ; it \u2019 s that scandals never really make it into the news that people actually watch or read .\n\u201c I think people need to be careful about how they choose to exercise their outrage \u201d\nHow do you see this playing out in the context of the US today ?\nIn the case of Trump , a lot of supporters probably feel like they were warned beforehand . Trump told them that this was a special interests government , that the system was rigged and corrupt and that he knew how to manage it . He can say , \u201c Look , I told you that I was a norm breaker , so you shouldn \u2019 t be surprised that I \u2019 m breaking norms . \u201d\nAs long as they feel like he \u2019 s doing their bidding , and as long as he can point to the bigger economic picture and say that things are going well , he probably thinks he can get away with it .\nI \u2019 m just speculating here \u2014 we can \u2019 t say for sure what \u2019 s going on or why a significant number of people aren \u2019 t upset by Trump \u2019 s excesses \u2014 but I think it \u2019 s worth considering these possibilities .\nDoes the recent history of populists in Europe and South America and elsewhere show that these leaders don \u2019 t pay a political price for their corruption ?\nSo far , it \u2019 s not clear that any of the contemporary populists that we \u2019 ve mentioned here have paid a significant price .\nI think there are likely a number of factors contributing to this . Sometimes the arguments you hear from populists are pretty explicit . They say , \u201c Look , everyone steals , and we steal as well .

But I think it does show pretty clearly that we shouldn \u2019 t assume that exposing corruption or shady dealings is automatically going to translate into these political actors paying a price at the polls .\n\u201c We have to make clear distinctions between normal politics and actions we consider out of bounds \u201d\nThere are a lot of concerns right now about corruption and shady dealings in the Trump White House . It \u2019 s alarming , and very much in line with what we \u2019 re seeing elsewhere in the world . How should citizens respond to this ?\nI think people need to be careful about how they choose to exercise their outrage . On the one hand , there are objections to specific policies , like the abolition of the Affordable Care Act , but this is the normal stuff of politics .
