As part of that process , he has also released an accompanying video delineating the reasons why he is seriously thinking about taking the plunge :\n\u201c If I run it will be because it is not acceptable for us to be dismissed and ignored by Washington politicians who we entrusted to lead this country .

As a distinguished neurosurgeon and public speaker , he has already amassed a strong and devoted following . But he is making the right decision ?\nAfter all , now that longtime Sen. Barbara Mikulski ( D-MD ) will give up her seat in 2016 , one wonders if he is . Jonah Goldberg , for his part , suggests Carson might have a greater impact on the direction of the nation as a senatorial candidate . He writes ,\nIf he ran , I doubt he would get a majority of the black vote in Maryland . But I also suspect he \u2019 d do quite well in that regard . Certainly many black voters might just opt to stay home rather than vote against him . And I \u2019 d expect Carson to do fantastically well in western Maryland and other more conservative parts of the state . He could raise money nationally ( maybe even roll over his presidential campaign money ? ) , not just on his star status but also on the promise of flipping a safe Democratic seat in what will be a tough election year for Republicans . Virtually every Republican star in the country would happily campaign for him .\nBut there \u2019 s just one problem : he 's not interested . His announcement today all but confirms this . It seems as though running for Senate hasn \u2019 t even crossed his mind .\nParting thought : Dr. Carson has never held political office before , and therefore it is very unlikely that he will win the nomination in 2016 .
