And journalists writing about the decision ( or at least the people writing their headlines ) like to use the word `` dilemma '' to describe the situation . But a little bit of international perspective helps illustrate that the Fed is n't really facing much of a dilemma .\nTake Brazil , which is currently falling into a recession . Ordinarily when an economy turns south , the central bank responds with looser money and lower interest rates . By flooding the economy with liquidity , a central bank can encourage businesses and consumers to spend more , cushioning the impact of the downturn . But there 's a problem : Brazil 's inflation rate is high and getting higher .\nTo deal with inflation , central banks need to tighten monetary policy and raise interest rates . If Brazil 's central bank does n't do this , it risks inflation spiraling out of control .\nHence , Brazil 's central bank faces a genuine dilemma . Raising interest rates could push the country deeper into recession . Lowering them could bring more inflation . Both options are bad .\nThings are very different here in America . Inflation over the past year has been a minuscule 0.2 percent . That 's mostly because oil prices have been falling , but even if you look at `` core '' inflation \u2014 which excludes volatile food and energy prices \u2014 the inflation rate is below the Fed 's 2 percent target . And market projections show it 's likely to stay below 2 percent for the next decade .\nAmerica 's central bank has a chance to have its cake and eat it too\nMeanwhile , the unemployment rate has fallen to a healthy 5.1 percent . But economic growth , job creation , and wage growth have all been a bit sluggish . So the economy is doing pretty well , but not as well as it could be doing .\nSo the US economy could probably use a bit more help . And with inflation low , there 's little risk in the Fed providing that help . So while Brazil 's central bank faces a difficult trade-off between unemployment and inflation , America 's central bank has a chance to have its cake and eat it too .\nSo if the Fed has things so easy , why do we see so many headlines about it facing a big dilemma ? One reason is that the media likes conflict and drama . `` Fed faces dilemma '' is a more clickable headline than `` The economy is probably going to be fine no matter what the Fed does next week .
