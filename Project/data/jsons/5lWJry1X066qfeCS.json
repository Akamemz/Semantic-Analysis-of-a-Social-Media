I know we \u2019 ve heard this before : liberals are more likely to unfriend you on social media due to political differences . Now , in the Trump era , it seems they can \u2019 t stand even being around Trump voters at all . More specifically , nearly half of liberals feel that if a friend supported Trump , it would strain a friendship , according to a Pew study , whereas only 13 percent of Republicans feel the same about those who voted for Hillary Clinton . And part of that is due to the fact that liberals live in a bubble ( via WaPo ) [ emphasis mine ] :\nThe poll shows almost half of liberal Democrats \u2014 47 percent \u2014 say that if a friend supported Trump , it would actually put a strain on their friendship . Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters more broadly , the number is 35 percent . White and more-educated Democrats are more likely to feel that it 's tough to even be friends with a Trump supporter . And while partisanship and tribalism are pretty bipartisan things in American politics today , Democrats are actually substantially less able to countenance friends who supported the wrong candidate : Just 13 percent of Republicans say a friend 's support of Hillary Clinton would strain their relationship . Part of the reason for the imbalance is likely that liberals tend to live in more homogeneous places and do n't even associate with conservatives.Another Pew study last year showed a whopping 47 percent of people who planned to vote for Clinton did n't have any close friends who were Trump supporters . By contrast , 31 percent of Trump supporters said they did n't have any friends who backed Clinton . [ \u2026 ] One final data point from the new Pew study : 68 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters say they find it \u201c stressful and frustrating \u201d to talk to people who have a different opinion of Trump . About half \u2014 52 percent \u2014 of Republican and GOP-leaning voters say the same .\nWell , if you have a liberal \u201c friend \u201d who feels that way about you , my suggestion would be to get new friends . I use to ask how weak do you have to be to find it intolerable to even be in the same space as a Trump voter , let alone find it stressful to be friends with one due to differing political views ? Now , given Hillary Clinton calling those of us who voted for Trump deplorable , plus the endless rage we \u2019 ve seen from liberals since 2016 , maybe we \u2019 re getting scientific notes that these people just plain hate us .\nThey hate conservatives .
