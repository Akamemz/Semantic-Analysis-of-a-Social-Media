Jim Jordan , Ohio Republican and chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee on regulatory affairs , stimulus oversight and government spending , is concerned about NGP \u2019 s finances and the timing of the loan guarantee .\n\u201c The company was in danger of defaulting on its financial obligation , and the [ Department of Energy \u2018 s ] assistance served as a de facto bailout , \u201d Mr. Jordan said . \u201c After receiving a taxpayer-backed $ 98.5 million loan guarantee , the company is still struggling . \u201d\nHe said the loan guarantee \u201c essentially served to prop up an already-faltering firm . \u201d\nIn January , Rep. Darrell E. Issa , California Republican and chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , told Mr. Chu that the NGP loan guarantee raised questions about why the Energy Department was investing significant taxpayer resources in a company with well-established financial problems .\nAt the time the Energy Department announced its conditional approval of the guarantee , Mr. Issa said NGP would have defaulted on a loan from TCW Asset Management Co. , then its primary lender , \u201c had DOE not swooped in to save the failing company with taxpayer money . \u201d\nA committee report said the loan did not finance any new construction and \u201c did not help to create a single job . \u201d\nDuring a House hearing in May , Rep. Frank C. Guinta , New Hampshire Republican , asked why NGP needed a government loan in 2010 just a year after it had received financing to get its plant up and running . He said it didn \u2019 t sound like a loan but a bailout .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t see it \u2019 s a good practice for the Department of Energy to use taxpayer-subsidized loans to provide to an entity that already has an existing facility , \u201d he said .\nMr. Jordan said the Energy Department handed out more than 20 loan guarantees to companies with an average credit rating of BB- , or \u201c junk status , \u201d meaning they were vulnerable to default if economic or business conditions changed . NPG was rated BB+ , which is considered speculative or junk and a step below investment grade .\nMr. Jordan and Mr. Issa have questioned why taxpayer money was \u201c put at such risk . \u201d\nBrian D. Fairbank , president and CEO of NGP , defended the company by saying its auditors were required to list all risks the firm faced because its stock is traded publicly . But , he said , NGP is making its payments on its federally backed loan .\n\u201c The loan is in good shape . The loan is fully supported , \u201d he said , noting that the federally guaranteed loan went to an NGP subsidiary known as NGP Blue Mountain 1 , for which he also serves as president and CEO .\nThe Energy Department guaranteed nearly $ 79 million , or 80 percent of the $ 98.5 million loan , financed in 2010 by John Hancock Financial Services . The loan is secured by assets from Blue Mountain 1 and gets paid from revenues generated by a 20-year power purchase agreement with NV Energy ( formerly Nevada Power Co. ) .\n\u201c There is no question we benefited from the loan guarantee , \u201d said Mr. Fairbank , adding that it helped them get the Hancock loan 4.14 percent compared with the 14 percent interest rate the company was paying on its existing debt with another lender .\nMr. Fairbank acknowledged that NGP is not current on a separate high-interest $ 88.4 million loan from a Washington investment firm , which is not backed by the federal government and is subordinate to the federal guaranteed loan \u2014 meaning John Hancock and the Energy Department have first claim on Blue Mountain \u2019 s assets and earnings in a default .\nJohn McIlveen , a stock analyst at Toronto-based Jacob Securities Inc. who monitors NPG , said he did not think the federally guaranteed loan was in trouble because it \u201c holds all the cards. \u201d But he said he did not see the subordinate lender \u201c getting out whole . \u201d\nHe said Blue Mountain 1 is not producing as much energy as the company had hoped and needs $ 20 million to help increase its capacity , which could be difficult to raise .\nEnergy Department spokesman Dan Leistikow defended the loan guarantee by saying NGP was continuing to make its loan payments \u201c on time and in full . \u201d\nMr. Reid \u2019 s spokeswoman Kristen Orthman said NGP has received bipartisan support because \u201c programs and incentives for clean energy have helped create jobs and make Nevada a growing leader in geothermal energy production . \u201d\nMr. Fairbank denied knowing or lobbying Mr. Reid , but the House Oversight Committee said Ormat Inc. , which was paid $ 80 million to build NGP \u2019 s Blue Mountain plant , has \u201c strong ties \u201d to the senator .
