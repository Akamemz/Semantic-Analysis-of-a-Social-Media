    "content": "When I was a kid , I found my father \u2019 s love for America embarrassing . He would get misty-eyed at the National Anthem . His hand over his heart was more than just a required gesture ; it seemed as if he was recording every beat , every movement of blood , timing it to the cadence of the music . The sight of the flag would make him pause , retreat to some soft acre of thoughts and dreams .\nAs I got older , I came to respect his patriotism , even though I disagreed in large part with his politics , particularly in the Sixties when the Vietnam War was raging and a friend of mine joined the Marines , writing me heartbreaking letters about the carnage in that faraway land . Respecting someone \u2019 s feelings , however , isn \u2019 t the same as identifying with them . I never teared up at any of America \u2019 s well known anthems , or at the sight of the flag .\nThat changed on 9/11 . By then , my father was deep into Alzheimer \u2019 s and mostly bedridden . On that somber , unwieldy morning , I drove to my parents \u2019 house and saw , on the corner of a busy intersection , a homeless man waving a tattered American flag . The tears that overtook me made it impossible to drive ; I had to pull over until they let up . They came from a place so deep in me , I thought they might have been waiting for me all my life . I wept for the country that I knew I \u2019 d taken for granted . I wept for the people who had gone to work on that clear blue day , or boarded a plane , never thinking that such horror could visit us here in the land of the free . People who would never see tomorrow .\nAt my parents \u2019 house , my mother and I leaned over my father \u2019 s bed and spoke softly to him . \u201c Something terrible has happened to us , \u201d I told him . \u201c To America . Planes flew into buildings , so many people are dead and none of us know how to make sense of it . I wish you could talk to us. \u201d Language was not available to my father at that point , but I will always believe that his soul heard me ; my anchor throughout his journey into Alzheimer \u2019 s was my belief that his soul couldn \u2019 t have the disease . He was in there , and his heart was breaking along with the heart of the country he loved . On my way home , Whitney Houston \u2019 s version of `` America the Beautiful '' came on the radio and I again had to pull over until my tears stopped . I memorized the place in my body where my love for this country , and my grief for its wounds , resided .\nSince January 20th , that same place inside me has brought me to tears on more than one occasion . It \u2019 s filled me with a dread of what is to come , and what we might lose . I \u2019 ve re-read the Constitution , because that is what we might lose \u2013 that exquisite document that is the construct of this land we call America . Because of it , we have a government balanced between three branches and rooted in freedom , openness and fairness . We have a free press that is not censored or controlled by the government . We are a rarity in the world . We have turned down dark paths in our history , but we have always tried to right ourselves by remembering the principles that America was founded upon .\nSince January 20th , I have shuddered every time I hear the phrase \u2018 America First. \u2019 That was the rallying cry of Charles Lindbergh , an unrepentant anti-Semite , and the America First Committee when they wanted this country to ignore the holocaust going on in Germany . They wanted us to close our eyes , our hearts , and our borders . Let us please not forget the origins of that phrase .\nSteve Bannon , the architect of this administration , has said he does not remember saying ( as Ronald Radosh has claimed ) that he is a Leninist who wants to bring everything crashing down . But Bannon has spoken about \u201c deconstructing the administrative state. \u201d He adheres to a theory of historical cycles , espoused by William Strauss and Neil Howe , that includes recurrent crises and claims that we are due for another . Mr. Bannon seems determined to bring that about . There is no love of country in wanting to tear apart its fabric and rip up its foundation . Destruction is not patriotism , it \u2019 s the underpinnings of tyranny .\nTyranny doesn \u2019 t blow in like a gale-force wind and transform the landscape in a day . It creeps in slowly , methodically . It instills fear , it creates enemies , it restricts freedoms , particularly freedom of the press . By creating and declaring enemies , you are governing by a doctrine of fear .\nWhen Steve Bannon says , referring to the media , \u201c If you think they \u2019 re going to give you your country back without a fight , you are sadly mistaken , \u201d he is trafficking in fear .
