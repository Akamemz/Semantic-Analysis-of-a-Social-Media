    "content": "Lawmakers and political operatives aligned with House GOP leadership are growing increasingly concerned that the powerful conservative outside group Club for Growth is taking marching orders from their arch-nemesis : The House Freedom Caucus .\nThe Club 's super PAC has spent more than $ 3.7 million to boost a half-dozen Republican primary candidates who 've pledged publicly or privately to join the Freedom Caucus , plus several of their current members in tough races . Some of the candidates ' policy positions are at odds with the Club 's positions , raising eyebrows among its detractors .\nThe group 's latest endorsee , Rep. Paul Gosar ( R-Ariz. ) , surprised many : The group spent more than $ 600,000 against him four years ago after Gosar earned a middling 63 percent on its internal scorecard , in part because of his votes on spending bills . ( Gosar now has a 90 percent mark . )\nCritics say the Club 's endorsements appear to go beyond the typical support of outside groups for like-minded candidates that one would expect , to something approaching an unholy coordination between a group of lawmakers and a big-spending conservative organization . There 's no daylight between the candidates the groups have gotten behind : All Club-backed House contenders this year are members of , or endorsed by , the Freedom Caucus .\nClub officials deny working in concert with the Freedom Caucus .\nOne Republican operative working on a House race , however , said a Club staffer told him explicitly that the group would back whomever the House Freedom Caucus supports . And a GOP lawmaker charged that the group has abandoned its independence .\n\u201c I was a Club-endorsed candidate when I first ran for Congress . I had to go through a very thorough interview by a committee of Club members at their office \u2026 to make sure I agreed with their issues , \u201d said retiring Rep. Lynn Westmoreland ( R-Ga. ) , who recently backed a candidate going up against a Club- and Freedom Caucus-endorsed hopeful . \u201c Now I \u2019 m told that the Club is taking a different approach . Now all a candidate has to do is be endorsed by the House Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan . \u201d\nWestmoreland added that the Club is `` spending their members \u2019 money on candidates that don \u2019 t necessarily line up with their core principles on immigration or free trade . I don \u2019 t understand the coordination and I would think it would be a surprise to Club members. \u201d ( The Club notes it has taken no official stance on immigration . )\nTensions between GOP leaders and the Freedom Caucus have wracked the House Republican Conference for years and ultimately drove ex-Speaker John Boehner to resign last year in the middle of his term . Caucus members have repeatedly bucked leaders on big votes , forcing them to rely on Democrats to pass legislation to keep the government funded and avoid a federal default .\nThe Freedom Caucus has made no secret of its desire to expand its ranks , currently about 40 lawmakers . Jordan , by the end of this year , will have lost several key members : Two quit the group , two ran for Senate and two are retiring . One of its highest-profile members , Rep. Tim Huelskamp ( R-Kansas ) , lost a hotly contested primary early this month that pitted the Freedom Caucus against establishment-aligned forces . The losses have made Jordan \u2019 s mission to find new members all the more pressing .\nClub spokesman Doug Sachtleben denied that the group is taking cues from Jordan , arguing that all its candidates hold true to the Club \u2019 s values of limited government spending and free markets . He said the Club is not \u201c coordinating \u201d with the Freedom Caucus , which campaign law prohibits . The group \u2019 s conservative views simply happen to align with the Freedom Caucus , he said , so it naturally backs candidates who are likely to join the group . Sachtleben also noted that the Club publicly endorsed most of its House candidates this year before Jordan did .\nHe did n't dispute , however , that the Club wants the Freedom Caucus to grow . Its members , Sachtleben said , aren \u2019 t afraid to vote against weak spending agreements \u2014 even if it means going against their leadership , which they 've done frequently \u2014 and that \u2019 s the kind of people the group works to elect .\n\u201c As we \u2019 ve watched the Freedom Caucus do its thing , we \u2019 ve been impressed with Jordan \u2019 s leadership and the issues they \u2019 ve stood on , \u201d Sachtleben said . `` It \u2019 s not so much that we \u2019 re tied at the hip with the Freedom Caucus , but we love what they \u2019 re doing , and we \u2019 re looking for members so that we can get a majority of economic conservatives within the majority of Republicans so they can have a more influential role . ''\nIntentional or not , having the heft of the well-heeled Club behind it means more power for the Freedom Caucus \u2014 and more problems for Ryan . The group , which often votes as a bloc , has stymied Ryan 's recent efforts to pass a budget as well as a legislative response to the Orlando shooting massacre . With funding to keep the government open set to expire Sept. 30 , its members are vowing to block any spending measure that they don \u2019 t agree with .\nThe caucus is poised to maintain or expand its influence next year .
