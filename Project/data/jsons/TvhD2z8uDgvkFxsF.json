Among other indiscretions , Beijing has stolen US technological and personnel secrets for its own advantage , antagonized US allies in the South China Sea , killed or imprisoned more than a dozen American informants , and taken millions of US jobs over the past 15 years .\nBut instead of working to fix at least some elements of strained US-China relations while putting up with the bulk of China \u2019 s misbehavior , Trump has chosen to completely reshape the relationship and go after Beijing on all of it .\n\u201c This administration is not really focused on just a couple of things , \u201d says Bonnie Glaser , a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington , \u201c it \u2019 s really focused on everything . \u201d\nHere are just a few examples : The biggest one , of course , is that Trump started a trade war expressly intended to cripple China \u2019 s economy . But he \u2019 s also increased support for Taiwan in its decades-long dispute with China , he disinvited China \u2019 s navy from participating in a major international military exercise , and he put pressure on Chinese Communist Party-funded culture and language programs on US college campuses .\nThe goal , according to experts and current and former Trump administration officials I spoke to , is to squeeze China \u2014 and in particular its economy \u2014 so hard that it finally decides to play by the rules once and for all . And if it doesn \u2019 t , well , then so be it . The Chinese have ripped us off for so long , the thinking goes , who cares if they \u2019 re unhappy now ?\n\u201c Trump is engaged in a sophisticated form of economic warfare to confront the Chinese , \u201d Steve Bannon , Trump \u2019 s former top strategist and a self-proclaimed China hawk , tells me .\nBut so far , it \u2019 s not working \u2014 because China has started to fight back .\nChina has already imposed retaliatory tariffs on billions of dollars \u2019 worth of American goods . And although Beijing initially helped put economic pressure on North Korea at the request of the Trump administration , it has now relaxed those sanctions , thereby giving Pyongyang an economic outlet to avoid devastating penalties . On top of that , Beijing has moved closer to Moscow and Tehran since Trump entered the Oval Office , partially thwarting US efforts to isolate those countries .\nThe Chinese have ripped us off for so long , the thinking goes , who cares if they \u2019 re unhappy now ?\nExperts say the debate in Beijing now centers on whether the US wants to stop China \u2019 s economic and political rise or even destroy the country \u2019 s ruling Communist Party \u2014 and less on how to cooperate with the US .\n\u201c Either scenario gives China no incentive for addressing any of the concerns we \u2019 re raising , \u201d says Ryan Hass , a top China official on the National Security Council from 2013 to 2017 .\nChina can just wait Trump out , experts tell me , since Trump will only be in office for no more than six more years , whereas Chinese President Xi Jinping is poised to rule China for decades . Beijing can therefore withstand the current pressure and wait for a new administration that likely will be less combative .\nThat means it \u2019 s unlikely Trump \u2019 s approach will succeed anytime soon \u2014 and may actually imperil the relationship long after Trump is gone .\n\u201c The administration diagnosed the right problem , \u201d Hass says , \u201c but it came up with the wrong remedy . \u201d\nEngagement with China , meaning consistent and significant dialogue on areas of mutual interest , has defined Washington-Beijing relations since the Nixon era . But to understand just how differently Trump deals with China , consider how the past two presidents \u2014 George W. Bush and Barack Obama \u2014 approached Beijing .\nBoth leaders wanted China to become a \u201c responsible stakeholder , \u201d a wonderfully wonky Washington term that mostly means they hoped Beijing would abide by global , cooperative rules even as it gained immense power .\nThe past two presidents had a remarkably similar strategy to see that happen : make China act more like America .\nIn 2001 , for example , Bush gave China permanent trade status . That allowed Beijing to exchange goods and services with the US \u2014 but with few to no tariffs . The hope was it would open up China \u2019 s market to the world and that over time , China would start to abide by accepted global trading practices .\nFourteen years later , Obama reached an agreement with China to curb cyberattacks . Months before the deal , China had hacked into the Office of Personnel Management \u2014 the US government \u2019 s chief human resources agency \u2014 and stolen sensitive information from millions of Americans .\nBut Obama , like presidents before him , claimed that engaging China might compel it to act less aggressively in cyberspace , or at least stop attacking America so much .\nBush and Obama only slightly curbed China \u2019 s unfair trading practices and cyberespionage . But they did find ways to address vital grievances with Beijing , such as human rights and press freedom , and work together on issues like climate change and military interactions , by following the general American strategy to engage China on tough , sometimes unpalatable , issues in the name of improved relations .\nTrump has so far rejected that approach . But that was always likely .\nTrump considers China one of America \u2019 s most cunning adversaries . At a 2016 campaign rally in Indiana , he told the crowd , \u201c We can \u2019 t continue to allow China to rape our country , and that \u2019 s what they \u2019 re doing . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s therefore not so shocking that Trump eschewed Bush and Obama \u2019 s approach and adopted a more pugilistic one . \u201c This administration has thrown off an ideological attachment to engagement for engagement \u2019 s sake , \u201d a senior administration official told me . \u201c That probably was overdue . \u201d\nHere \u2019 s what that means in practice : The US will no longer just talk about the problems it has with China . Instead , Washington will simply punish Beijing for perceived wrongs .\nThat \u2019 s manifested itself mostly visibly in a war \u2014 a trade war .\nAmerica and China are the world \u2019 s two largest economies , and the US is China \u2019 s largest trading partner . But nothing seems to bother Trump more than that relationship .\n\u201c It \u2019 s an economic enemy , because they have taken advantage of us like nobody in history , \u201d he said about China during a 2015 Good Morning America interview . \u201c It \u2019 s the greatest theft in the history of the world what they \u2019 ve done to the United States . \u201d\nAmerica \u2019 s trade deficit in goods and services with China was $ 335.4 billion in 2017 . That deficit keeps rising , and in August it grew by another $ 31 billion , meaning that Beijing exported $ 31 billion more goods to the US that month than the US sent the other way .\nTrump and some of his top economic advisers , including Director of Trade and Industrial Policy Peter Navarro , US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer , and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross , see this as a bad thing .\n\u201c When net exports are negative , \u201d Ross and Navarro wrote in a policy paper during the presidential campaign ; \u201c that is , when a country runs a trade deficit by importing more than it exports , this subtracts from growth . \u201d\nThey believe the remedy , therefore , is to curtail imports from China in order to boost economic growth . To do that , Trump has turned to tariffs \u2014 taxes on imported goods , in this case from China \u2014 that make them more expensive for American consumers to buy .\nBut as my colleague Matthew Yglesias has explained , doing this to boost the economy doesn \u2019 t actually work :\nIf America \u2019 s net exports grow because America becomes a fashionable tourist destination and sales of Boeing airplanes surge , then that will boost the economy . But if America \u2019 s net exports grow because new Trump-imposed taxes cause the price of imported goods to surge , then the economy is going to shrink .\nTrump and his advisers , though , continue to insist that this is the way to go . \u201c Tariffs . I want tariffs , \u201d Trump told advisers about trading with China during Chief of Staff John Kelly \u2019 s first week in the White House .\nHe has those tariffs now \u2014 and it has ignited a trade war .\nOn August 7 , for example , Trump announced that he \u2019 d place 25 percent tariffs on $ 16 billion of Chinese goods . The tariffs mostly targeted high-tech Chinese products to put economic pressure on Beijing \u2019 s \u201c Made in China 2025 \u201d program , a government initiative to transform the country into an advanced manufacturing powerhouse in areas like biotechnology , artificial intelligence , and autonomous vehicles .\nThe next day , Beijing responded in kind , putting the same percentage of tariffs on the same amount of American goods . As of now , the US has imposed tariffs on a total of $ 50 billion in Chinese items , and it doesn \u2019 t look like the tit-for-tat will stop anytime soon .\nIn fact , Trump is a week away from placing tariffs on $ 200 billion worth of Chinese products in part because neither side has agreed to a new trade deal on intellectual property and industrial issues . Even more could follow : \u201c I hate to say this , but behind that there is another $ 267 billion ready to go on short notice if I want , \u201d the president said on September 7 .\nIf he follows through on all his tariff threats , Trump will have placed levies on nearly every product China sends to America .\nBeijing , of course , is unhappy with this whole ordeal . \u201c There is a Chinese saying , \u201d Geng Shuang , a spokesperson for China \u2019 s Foreign Ministry , said on September 14 , \u201c \u2018 You will sacrifice 800 soldiers of your own to kill just 1,000 enemies. \u2019 It \u2019 s meaningless to discuss who loses 1,000 and who loses 800 . \u201d\nIt appears Trump is the sole reason why Washington and Beijing have yet to reach an agreement even after months of talks . \u201c Twice now the Chinese have thought that they had a deal , \u201d the Center for Strategic and International Studies \u2019 Glaser says , \u201c but then it fell through when it went to the president . \u201d\nThe US and China may yet hold another round of trade talks despite the newest sanctions , but it now may be too late to stop the spat . \u201c China is convinced that Trump is not looking to resolve the trade dispute , \u201d Daniel Russel , the State Department \u2019 s top Asia diplomat from 2013 to 2017 , told me . Instead , he says , the Chinese feel Trump is merely using trade issues as a way \u201c to undercut China . \u201d\nThree sources familiar with the Trump administration \u2019 s economic strategy toward China tell me that the White House has two main objectives in the trade war .\nThe first is to remove China from the center of the global supply chain . Here \u2019 s one example of Beijing \u2019 s importance : Apple has around 27 China-based suppliers , mainly in the electrical components sector .\nImposing tariffs on Chinese products , some of which form parts in complicated items like automobiles , could prompt manufacturers to look elsewhere for those components . That would seriously hurt China \u2019 s economy as money flows to other companies in other countries .\nThe second goal is to make multinational corporations wary about doing business in China . If large companies , say South Korea \u2019 s Samsung or America \u2019 s Google , decide it \u2019 s too expensive or too politically dangerous to operate in the country and choose to build plants elsewhere instead , that would also harm China \u2019 s economy .\nTrump takes a personal interest in that second objective , shaming US companies on Twitter for making products in China partially to coax them to build those products in America .\nApple prices may increase because of the massive Tariffs we may be imposing on China - but there is an easy solution where there would be ZERO tax , and indeed a tax incentive . Make your products in the United States instead of China . Start building new plants now . Exciting ! # MAGA \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) September 8 , 2018\nPut together , it appears the administration is purposely aiming to harm China \u2019 s economic strength .\nIf the plans succeeds , a massive slowdown \u2014 or , worse , a reversal \u2014 in China \u2019 s economy could lead to a global financial crisis . The ripple effects of the world \u2019 s second-largest economy slowing down would hit nearly every market in every region and lead to billions of dollars lost throughout the world .\nWhen pressed , the senior Trump administration official denied that the tariffs are intended to crash China \u2019 s economy .\nAs long as Beijing is receptive to US exports , \u201c we have no interest in crippling China \u2019 s economy , \u201d the official insisted . \u201c What we have is an interest in is ensuring that China plays by the rules and , as China \u2019 s economy develops , it is as open to US participation as the US market has been for China . \u201d\nThe Chinese market is currently more closed to American exporters than it was before Trump became president\nYet the trade war has led to the opposite result : more tariffs on US-made products . In other words , the Chinese market is currently more closed to American exporters than it was before Trump became president .\nThe hope is that the trade spat will force China to back down and open up its market more than before in the future . But it has so far had a negligible effect on China \u2019 s economy , in part because it takes so long to notice changes in trade . It \u2019 s still possible , though , that an extended economic fight with the US could deter investors from pouring money into China .\nEven if that does happen , it could end up hurting America \u2019 s economy at the same time . While fewer than 1,000 primary metals manufacturing jobs have returned to the US , many of those plants use Chinese products to assemble complex items . Increased tariffs on specialized products could force factories to spend more on those items , thereby costing American jobs in the future .\nMeanwhile , the prices of steel and washing machines \u2014 both items on which Trump placed tariffs \u2014 have gone up .\nOn its own , the trade war is a dramatic change in US-China relations \u2014 but that \u2019 s not the only place where the Trump administration has flexed its muscles .\nLet \u2019 s start with Taiwan . The little island of 23 million people off China \u2019 s coast is of great importance to Beijing . China considers the island \u2014 now a self-ruled democracy \u2014 part of \u201c One China , \u201d demanding that the US and others accept that .\nThe US has consistently refused to do so , even as other countries have . In late August , for instance , El Salvador broke its ties to Taiwan and established diplomatic relations with China . The Trump administration reacted forcefully , blaming Beijing for \u201c apparent interference \u201d in El Salvador \u2019 s politics and suggesting the US may reevaluate its relationship with the Central American nation . Taiwan now only has 17 countries that recognize it as an independent country .\nIn June 2017 , Trump also approved a $ 1.4 billion arms sale to Taiwan , which included advanced missiles and torpedoes . And in March , he signed the Taiwan Travel Act , allowing senior US officials to meet with their Taiwanese colleagues in the country , as well as having Taiwan \u2019 s officials come to the US .\nUS support for Taiwan remains a huge sticking point between Washington and Beijing . \u201c Compared with economic and trade issues , the Taiwan issue is a top priority for Beijing and is more politically sensitive , \u201d Fu-Kuo Liu , an expert at National Chengchi University in Taiwan \u2019 s capital , Taipei , told Bloomberg on March 13 .\nIn May , the Trump administration told China it could not participate in the Rim of the Pacific ( RIMPAC ) international military exercise in Hawaii , which takes place every other year . The drill allows the 22 nations in RIMPAC to practice sailing and operating together . The Obama administration invited China to participate in the exercise twice , in 2014 and 2016 , in part to incentivize China to stop behaving so aggressively in the South China Sea .\nBut the Trump administration specifically cited Beijing \u2019 s South China Sea actions as the reason why it was disinvited . \u201c China \u2019 s continued militarization of disputed features in the South China Sea only serve to raise tensions and destabilize the region , \u201d Marine Lt. Col. Christopher Logan , a Pentagon spokesperson , told USNI News . \u201c China \u2019 s behavior is inconsistent with the principles and purposes of the RIMPAC exercise . \u201d\nBeijing claims the South China Sea , which lies on the country \u2019 s southeast coast , belongs to China . But other countries surround the body of water , including Vietnam , Taiwan , and the Philippines , each with its own competing claims . More control of the sea allows for greater access to resources \u2014 like seafood and energy \u2014 as well as global prestige .\nYet China acts like the South China Sea is an aquatic extension of its land . It has built artificial islands , some of which contain runways for warplanes to land on , and regularly allows Chinese companies to fish in areas near other countries \u2019 coasts .\nDespite that , Beijing says the area is \u201c calm \u201d and accuses others , including the US , of fomenting tensions there .\nFinally , the Trump administration has cracked down on Chinese Communist Party-funded programs , known as Confucius Institutes , that offer language and culture classes on more than 100 college and university campuses in the United States .\nThe institutes are ostensibly intended to help American students learn Chinese and introduce them to Chinese culture , and many universities have turned to them as a cost-effective way to provide Chinese-language instruction to students .\nBut critics , including members of Congress and the FBI , accuse the institutes of trying to spread the Chinese government \u2019 s influence on American campuses and indoctrinate students and faculty with Beijing \u2019 s views on history and foreign policy .\nIn February , Sen. Marco Rubio ( R-FL ) described the institutes as part of \u201c China \u2019 s aggressive campaign to \u2018 infiltrate \u2019 American classrooms , stifle free inquiry , and subvert free expression both at home and abroad . \u201d\nIndeed , as Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian , one of the leading journalists reporting on Chinese influence operations in the US , has noted , \u201c the Chinese Communist Party has openly said that Confucius Institutes are used for propaganda . Former top party official Li Changchun has referred to the institutes as \u2018 an important part of China \u2019 s overseas propaganda set-up . \u2019 \u201d\nTrump has sided with the institutes \u2019 critics : In August , he signed a Pentagon funding bill that contains a provision restricting universities from using Defense Department money to fund language programs taught by a Confucius Institute . ( The Pentagon frequently provides grants to universities to fund training in critical languages \u2014 like Mandarin Chinese . )\nSome have started to close already : The University of North Florida , the University of Illinois , and Texas A & M have all shuttered their institutes this year .\nRussel , the former top diplomat who \u2019 s now at the Asia Society , says the Trump administration \u2019 s approach toward China has done little to improve Beijing \u2019 s behavior \u2014 and in fact has provoked the opposite response , in many cases .\nSince Trump became president , China has moved closer to Russia both militarily and economically , helped North Korea escape US-led sanctions put in place to halt its nuclear program , and continued to do business with Iran despite US efforts to starve Tehran \u2019 s regime of money .\nTake the Russia relationship . China \u2019 s military joined Russia \u2019 s this month for its biggest war game since the Cold War , sending 3,200 Chinese troops to the participate in the exercise . That came just four months after the US announced it was kicking China out of its big war game , suggesting China \u2019 s decision to participate in the Russian exercise was at least partly a response to America \u2019 s snub .\nThe same day the Russian war game kicked off , Chinese President Xi Jinping traveled to the Russian city of Vladivostok to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of a Russian-sponsored economic forum . Standing beside Putin , Xi told reporters that China and Russia would work together to maintain stability and peace in the world .\nJust two months before , Xi had awarded Putin the first Friendship Medal of the People \u2019 s Republic of China .\nChina has also complicated Trump \u2019 s signature foreign policy initiative : dismantling North Korea \u2019 s nuclear program . Beijing accounts for about 90 percent of Pyongyang \u2019 s trade , which is why Trump has put immense pressure on China to curb its economic ties with North Korea .\nBut in recent months , Beijing has increased its trade relationship with Pyongyang \u2014 thereby weakening the effect of the harsh economic sanctions that helped bring North Korea to the negotiating table in the first place .\nIndeed , when Trump abruptly canceled Secretary of State Mike Pompeo \u2019 s planned visit to Pyongyang in late August because the US and North Korea were \u201c not making sufficient progress with respect to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula , \u201d he explicitly blamed China for the breakdown in negotiations :\nI have asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo not to go to North Korea , at this time , because I feel we are not making sufficient progress with respect to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula ... \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) August 24 , 2018\n... Additionally , because of our much tougher Trading stance with China , I do not believe they are helping with the process of denuclearization as they once were ( despite the UN Sanctions which are in place ) ... \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) August 24 , 2018\n... Secretary Pompeo looks forward to going to North Korea in the near future , most likely after our Trading relationship with China is resolved . In the meantime I would like to send my warmest regards and respect to Chairman Kim . I look forward to seeing him soon ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) August 24 , 2018\nAnd when Trump withdrew the United States from the Iran nuclear deal in May , one goal of doing so was to isolate Tehran economically by reimposing sanctions the agreement had lifted . The Trump administration has lobbied multiple countries , particularly in Europe , to stop doing business with Iran as part of the effort .\nBeijing , however , has continued its business relationship with Tehran , mainly in the energy sector . China is Iran \u2019 s biggest energy customer , spending around $ 15 billion a year on crude oil . Beijing doesn \u2019 t want that to change anytime soon .\n\u201c China \u2019 s commercial cooperation with Iran is open and transparent , reasonable and fair , not violating any United Nations Security Council resolutions , \u201d the Chinese government said in a statement in August .\nExperts warn that Trump \u2019 s strategy toward China could have more serious repercussions that endure long after Trump , and perhaps even Xi , is in power\nMeanwhile , Beijing continues some of its grander projects . The biggest is China \u2019 s Belt and Road initiative , under which the country is investing more than a trillion dollars around the world to improve the country \u2019 s economic and political influence .\nIt \u2019 s part of Xi \u2019 s grander effort to make China \u2014 and not America \u2014 the world \u2019 s most powerful country .\nAfter Trump \u2019 s election and the ascendancy of his isolationist rhetoric , Xi went to the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland \u2014 the yearly meeting of the global elite \u2014 to proclaim that China would defend increased globalization . And after Trump withdrew the US from the Paris climate agreement in 2017 , Xi said China would take the lead in combating climate change , even though China is the world \u2019 s largest carbon polluter .\nBut , surprisingly , Trump hasn \u2019 t retaliated against China for thwarting America \u2019 s foreign policy in these areas . The answer why may lie in a particular Trump tweet : \u201c President Xi and I will always be friends , no matter what happens with our dispute on trade , \u201d Trump tweeted on April 8 .\nTrump maintains he and Xi remain close ever since they met at Mar-a-Lago for a summit in April 2017 .\nXi , who could lead China for life , may feel the same , but he hasn \u2019 t stopped pursuing China \u2019 s global objectives even with Trump in the White House . That means their good personal relationship \u2014 real or imagined \u2014 won \u2019 t be enough to make China America \u2019 s ally anytime soon .\nBut experts warn that Trump \u2019 s strategy toward China could have more serious repercussions that endure long after Trump , and perhaps even Xi , is in power .\n\u201c It \u2019 s potentially creating a generation of Chinese decision-makers whose view of the United States is a hostile one , \u201d says Russel . \u201c The Trump administration is sowing the seeds of a host of problems that will only become evident over time . \u201d\nCorrection : A previous version of this article incorrectly stated America \u2019 s trade deficit with China in 2017 and by how much the deficit rose in August 2018 .",

But to understand just how differently Trump deals with China, consider how the past two presidents \u2014 George W.

But they did find ways to address vital grievances with Beijing, such as human rights and press freedom, and work together on issues like climate change and military interactions, by following the general American strategy to engage China on tough, sometimes unpalatable, issues in the name of improved relations.\n\nTrump has so far rejected that approach. But that was always likely.\n\nTrump considers China one of America\u2019s most cunning adversaries. At a 2016 campaign rally in Indiana, he told the crowd, \u201cWe can\u2019t continue to allow China to rape our country, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s therefore not so shocking that Trump eschewed Bush and Obama\u2019s approach and adopted a more pugilistic one. \u201cThis administration has thrown off an ideological attachment to engagement for engagement\u2019s sake,\u201d a senior administration official told me. \u201cThat probably was overdue.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what that means in practice: The US will no longer just talk about the problems it has with China. Instead, Washington will simply punish Beijing for perceived wrongs.\n\nThat\u2019s manifested itself mostly visibly in a war \u2014 a trade war.\n\n\u201cTariffs. I want tariffs.\u201d\n\nAmerica and China are the world\u2019s two largest economies, and the US is China\u2019s largest trading partner. But nothing seems to bother Trump more than that relationship.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an economic enemy, because they have taken advantage of us like nobody in history,\u201d he said about China during a 2015 Good Morning America interview. \u201cIt\u2019s the greatest theft in the history of the world what they\u2019ve done to the United States.\u201d\n\nAmerica\u2019s trade deficit in goods and services with China was $335.4 billion in 2017. That deficit keeps rising, and in August it grew by another $31 billion, meaning that Beijing exported $31 billion more goods to the US that month than the US sent the other way.\n\nTrump and some of his top economic advisers, including Director of Trade and Industrial Policy Peter Navarro, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, see this as a bad thing.\n\n\u201cWhen net exports are negative,\u201d Ross and Navarro wrote in a policy paper during the presidential campaign; \u201cthat is, when a country runs a trade deficit by importing more than it exports, this subtracts from growth.\u201d\n\nThey believe the remedy, therefore, is to curtail imports from China in order to boost economic growth. To do that, Trump has turned to tariffs \u2014 taxes on imported goods, in this case from China \u2014 that make them more expensive for American consumers to buy.\n\nBut as my colleague Matthew Yglesias has explained, doing this to boost the economy doesn\u2019t actually work:\n\nIf America\u2019s net exports grow because America becomes a fashionable tourist destination and sales of Boeing airplanes surge, then that will boost the economy. But if America\u2019s net exports grow because new Trump-imposed taxes cause the price of imported goods to surge, then the economy is going to shrink.\n\nTrump and his advisers, though, continue to insist that this is the way to go. \u201cTariffs. I want tariffs,\u201d Trump told advisers about trading with China during Chief of Staff John Kelly\u2019s first week in the White House.\n\nHe has those tariffs now \u2014 and it has ignited a trade war.\n\nOn August 7, for example, Trump announced that he\u2019d place 25 percent tariffs on $16 billion of Chinese goods. The tariffs mostly targeted high-tech Chinese products to put economic pressure on Beijing\u2019s \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d program, a government initiative to transform the country into an advanced manufacturing powerhouse in areas like biotechnology, artificial intelligence, and autonomous vehicles.\n\nThe next day, Beijing responded in kind, putting the same percentage of tariffs on the same amount of American goods. As of now, the US has imposed tariffs on a total of $50 billion in Chinese items, and it doesn\u2019t look like the tit-for-tat will stop anytime soon.\n\nIn fact, Trump is a week away from placing tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese products in part because neither side has agreed to a new trade deal on intellectual property and industrial issues. Even more could follow: \u201cI hate to say this, but behind that there is another $267 billion ready to go on short notice if I want,\u201d the president said on September 7.\n\nIf he follows through on all his tariff threats, Trump will have placed levies on nearly every product China sends to America.\n\nBeijing, of course, is unhappy with this whole ordeal. \u201cThere is a Chinese saying,\u201d Geng Shuang, a spokesperson for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, said on September 14, \u201c\u2018You will sacrifice 800 soldiers of your own to kill just 1,000 enemies.\u2019 It\u2019s meaningless to discuss who loses 1,000 and who loses 800.\u201d\n\nIt appears Trump is the sole reason why Washington and Beijing have yet to reach an agreement even after months of talks. \u201cTwice now the Chinese have thought that they had a deal,\u201d the Center for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 Glaser says, \u201cbut then it fell through when it went to the president.\u201d\n\nThe US and China may yet hold another round of trade talks despite the newest sanctions, but it now may be too late to stop the spat. \u201cChina is convinced that Trump is not looking to resolve the trade dispute,\u201d Daniel Russel, the State Department\u2019s top Asia diplomat from 2013 to 2017, told me. Instead, he says, the Chinese feel Trump is merely using trade issues as a way \u201cto undercut China.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s fears may be more real than it thinks.\n\nAmerica\u2019s plan to ruin China\u2019s economy, explained\n\nThree sources familiar with the Trump administration\u2019s economic strategy toward China tell me that the White House has two main objectives in the trade war.\n\nThe first is to remove China from the center of the global supply chain. Here\u2019s one example of Beijing\u2019s importance: Apple has around 27 China-based suppliers, mainly in the electrical components sector.\n\nImposing tariffs on Chinese products, some of which form parts in complicated items like automobiles, could prompt manufacturers to look elsewhere for those components. That would seriously hurt China\u2019s economy as money flows to other companies in other countries.\n\nThe second goal is to make multinational corporations wary about doing business in China. If large companies, say South Korea\u2019s Samsung or America\u2019s Google, decide it\u2019s too expensive or too politically dangerous to operate in the country and choose to build plants elsewhere instead, that would also harm China\u2019s economy.\n\nTrump takes a personal interest in that second objective, shaming US companies on Twitter for making products in China partially to coax them to build those products in America.\n\nApple prices may increase because of the massive Tariffs we may be imposing on China - but there is an easy solution where there would be ZERO tax, and indeed a tax incentive. Make your products in the United States instead of China. Start building new plants now. Exciting! #MAGA \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 8, 2018\n\nPut together, it appears the administration is purposely aiming to harm China\u2019s economic strength.\n\nIf the plans succeeds, a massive slowdown \u2014 or, worse, a reversal \u2014 in China\u2019s economy could lead to a global financial crisis. The ripple effects of the world\u2019s second-largest economy slowing down would hit nearly every market in every region and lead to billions of dollars lost throughout the world.\n\nWhen pressed, the senior Trump administration official denied that the tariffs are intended to crash China\u2019s economy.\n\nAs long as Beijing is receptive to US exports, \u201cwe have no interest in crippling China\u2019s economy,\u201d the official insisted. \u201cWhat we have is an interest in is ensuring that China plays by the rules and, as China\u2019s economy develops, it is as open to US participation as the US market has been for China.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese market is currently more closed to American exporters than it was before Trump became president\n\nYet the trade war has led to the opposite result: more tariffs on US-made products. In other words, the Chinese market is currently more closed to American exporters than it was before Trump became president.\n\nThe hope is that the trade spat will force China to back down and open up its market more than before in the future. But it has so far had a negligible effect on China\u2019s economy, in part because it takes so long to notice changes in trade. It\u2019s still possible, though, that an extended economic fight with the US could deter investors from pouring money into China.\n\nEven if that does happen, it could end up hurting America\u2019s economy at the same time. While fewer than 1,000 primary metals manufacturing jobs have returned to the US, many of those plants use Chinese products to assemble complex items. Increased tariffs on specialized products could force factories to spend more on those items, thereby costing American jobs in the future.\n\nMeanwhile, the prices of steel and washing machines \u2014 both items on which Trump placed tariffs \u2014 have gone up.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the trade war\n\nOn its own, the trade war is a dramatic change in US-China relations \u2014 but that\u2019s not the only place where the Trump administration has flexed its muscles.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Taiwan. The little island of 23 million people off China\u2019s coast is of great importance to Beijing. China considers the island \u2014 now a self-ruled democracy \u2014 part of \u201cOne China,\u201d demanding that the US and others accept that.\n\nThe US has consistently refused to do so, even as other countries have. In late August, for instance, El Salvador broke its ties to Taiwan and established diplomatic relations with China. The Trump administration reacted forcefully, blaming Beijing for \u201capparent interference\u201d in El Salvador\u2019s politics and suggesting the US may reevaluate its relationship with the Central American nation. Taiwan now only has 17 countries that recognize it as an independent country.\n\nIn June 2017, Trump also approved a $1.4 billion arms sale to Taiwan, which included advanced missiles and torpedoes. And in March, he signed the Taiwan Travel Act, allowing senior US officials to meet with their Taiwanese colleagues in the country, as well as having Taiwan\u2019s officials come to the US.\n\nUS support for Taiwan remains a huge sticking point between Washington and Beijing. \u201cCompared with economic and trade issues, the Taiwan issue is a top priority for Beijing and is more politically sensitive,\u201d Fu-Kuo Liu, an expert at National Chengchi University in Taiwan\u2019s capital, Taipei, told Bloomberg on March 13.\n\nBut there\u2019s more.\n\nIn May, the Trump administration told China it could not participate in the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) international military exercise in Hawaii, which takes place every other year. The drill allows the 22 nations in RIMPAC to practice sailing and operating together. The Obama administration invited China to participate in the exercise twice, in 2014 and 2016, in part to incentivize China to stop behaving so aggressively in the South China Sea.\n\nBut the Trump administration specifically cited Beijing\u2019s South China Sea actions as the reason why it was disinvited. \u201cChina\u2019s continued militarization of disputed features in the South China Sea only serve to raise tensions and destabilize the region,\u201d Marine Lt. Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesperson, told USNI News. \u201cChina\u2019s behavior is inconsistent with the principles and purposes of the RIMPAC exercise.\u201d\n\nBeijing claims the South China Sea, which lies on the country\u2019s southeast coast, belongs to China. But other countries surround the body of water, including Vietnam, Taiwan, and the Philippines, each with its own competing claims. More control of the sea allows for greater access to resources \u2014 like seafood and energy \u2014 as well as global prestige.\n\nYet China acts like the South China Sea is an aquatic extension of its land. It has built artificial islands, some of which contain runways for warplanes to land on, and regularly allows Chinese companies to fish in areas near other countries\u2019 coasts.\n\nDespite that, Beijing says the area is \u201ccalm\u201d and accuses others, including the US, of fomenting tensions there.\n\nFinally, the Trump administration has cracked down on Chinese Communist Party-funded programs, known as Confucius Institutes, that offer language and culture classes on more than 100 college and university campuses in the United States.\n\nThe institutes are ostensibly intended to help American students learn Chinese and introduce them to Chinese culture, and many universities have turned to them as a cost-effective way to provide Chinese-language instruction to students.\n\nBut critics, including members of Congress and the FBI, accuse the institutes of trying to spread the Chinese government\u2019s influence on American campuses and indoctrinate students and faculty with Beijing\u2019s views on history and foreign policy.\n\nIn February, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) described the institutes as part of \u201cChina\u2019s aggressive campaign to \u2018infiltrate\u2019 American classrooms, stifle free inquiry, and subvert free expression both at home and abroad.\u201d\n\nIndeed, as Bethany Allen-Ebrahimian, one of the leading journalists reporting on Chinese influence operations in the US, has noted, \u201cthe Chinese Communist Party has openly said that Confucius Institutes are used for propaganda. Former top party official Li Changchun has referred to the institutes as \u2018an important part of China\u2019s overseas propaganda set-up.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump has sided with the institutes\u2019 critics: In August, he signed a Pentagon funding bill that contains a provision restricting universities from using Defense Department money to fund language programs taught by a Confucius Institute. (The Pentagon frequently provides grants to universities to fund training in critical languages \u2014 like Mandarin Chinese.)\n\nSome have started to close already: The University of North Florida, the University of Illinois, and Texas A&M have all shuttered their institutes this year.\n\nChina hasn\u2019t caved to Trump. It\u2019s fought back.\n\nRussel, the former top diplomat who\u2019s now at the Asia Society, says the Trump administration\u2019s approach toward China has done little to improve Beijing\u2019s behavior \u2014 and in fact has provoked the opposite response, in many cases.\n\nSince Trump became president, China has moved closer to Russia both militarily and economically, helped North Korea escape US-led sanctions put in place to halt its nuclear program, and continued to do business with Iran despite US efforts to starve Tehran\u2019s regime of money.\n\nTake the Russia relationship. China\u2019s military joined Russia\u2019s this month for its biggest war game since the Cold War, sending 3,200 Chinese troops to the participate in the exercise. That came just four months after the US announced it was kicking China out of its big war game, suggesting China\u2019s decision to participate in the Russian exercise was at least partly a response to America\u2019s snub.\n\nThe same day the Russian war game kicked off, Chinese President Xi Jinping traveled to the Russian city of Vladivostok to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of a Russian-sponsored economic forum. Standing beside Putin, Xi told reporters that China and Russia would work together to maintain stability and peace in the world.\n\nJust two months before, Xi had awarded Putin the first Friendship Medal of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n\nChina has also complicated Trump\u2019s signature foreign policy initiative: dismantling North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. Beijing accounts for about 90 percent of Pyongyang\u2019s trade, which is why Trump has put immense pressure on China to curb its economic ties with North Korea.\n\nBut in recent months, Beijing has increased its trade relationship with Pyongyang \u2014 thereby weakening the effect of the harsh economic sanctions that helped bring North Korea to the negotiating table in the first place.\n\nIndeed, when Trump abruptly canceled Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s planned visit to Pyongyang in late August because the US and North Korea were \u201cnot making sufficient progress with respect to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\u201d he explicitly blamed China for the breakdown in negotiations:\n\nI have asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo not to go to North Korea, at this time, because I feel we are not making sufficient progress with respect to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 24, 2018\n\n...Additionally, because of our much tougher Trading stance with China, I do not believe they are helping with the process of denuclearization as they once were (despite the UN Sanctions which are in place)... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 24, 2018\n\n...Secretary Pompeo looks forward to going to North Korea in the near future, most likely after our Trading relationship with China is resolved. In the meantime I would like to send my warmest regards and respect to Chairman Kim. I look forward to seeing him soon! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 24, 2018\n\nAnd when Trump withdrew the United States from the Iran nuclear deal in May, one goal of doing so was to isolate Tehran economically by reimposing sanctions the agreement had lifted. The Trump administration has lobbied multiple countries, particularly in Europe, to stop doing business with Iran as part of the effort.\n\nBeijing, however, has continued its business relationship with Tehran, mainly in the energy sector. China is Iran\u2019s biggest energy customer, spending around $15 billion a year on crude oil. Beijing doesn\u2019t want that to change anytime soon.\n\n\u201cChina\u2019s commercial cooperation with Iran is open and transparent, reasonable and fair, not violating any United Nations Security Council resolutions,\u201d the Chinese government said in a statement in August.\n\nExperts warn that Trump\u2019s strategy toward China could have more serious repercussions that endure long after Trump, and perhaps even Xi, is in power\n\nMeanwhile, Beijing continues some of its grander projects. The biggest is China\u2019s Belt and Road initiative, under which the country is investing more than a trillion dollars around the world to improve the country\u2019s economic and political influence.\n\nIt\u2019s part of Xi\u2019s grander effort to make China \u2014 and not America \u2014 the world\u2019s most powerful country.\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s election and the ascendancy of his isolationist rhetoric, Xi went to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland \u2014 the yearly meeting of the global elite \u2014 to proclaim that China would defend increased globalization. And after Trump withdrew the US from the Paris climate agreement in 2017, Xi said China would take the lead in combating climate change, even though China is the world\u2019s largest carbon polluter.\n\nBut, surprisingly, Trump hasn\u2019t retaliated against China for thwarting America\u2019s foreign policy in these areas. The answer why may lie in a particular Trump tweet: \u201cPresident Xi and I will always be friends, no matter what happens with our dispute on trade,\u201d Trump tweeted on April 8.\n\nTrump\u2019s approach is \u201csowing the seeds\u201d for larger problems\n\nTrump maintains he and Xi remain close ever since they met at Mar-a-Lago for a summit in April 2017.\n\nXi, who could lead China for life, may feel the same, but he hasn\u2019t stopped pursuing China\u2019s global objectives even with Trump in the White House. That means their good personal relationship \u2014 real or imagined \u2014 won\u2019t be enough to make China America\u2019s ally anytime soon.\n\nBut experts warn that Trump\u2019s strategy toward China could have more serious repercussions that endure long after Trump, and perhaps even Xi, is in power.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s potentially creating a generation of Chinese decision-makers whose view of the United States is a hostile one,\u201d says Russel. \u201cThe Trump administration is sowing the seeds of a host of problems that will only become evident over time.\u201d\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated America\u2019s trade deficit with China in 2017 and by how much the deficit rose in August 2018.",
