In this case , it \u2019 s a first-person point of view . Our cameraperson , a woman in Scottsdale , Arizona , is slapping masks out of a display .\nThis woman in Scottsdale , Arizona was super upset with Target for selling face masks . So upset in fact , that she attacked their display .... pic.twitter.com/ye9LiDz0JH \u2014 Rex Chapman ( @ RexChapman ) July 5 , 2020\n\u201c This shit \u2019 s fucking over , \u201d she says , again and again , her free hand slapping away mask after mask .\nPlastic crumples . The metal display screeches .

This expanding oeuvre includes a woman going ballistic in Trader Joe \u2019 s , another woman terrorizing bagel shop patrons by coughing on them , another throwing food , and an older , smaller man tumbling , belly-first , through a Walmart to assert his non-mask dominance :\nOkay imagine being this much of a Male # Karen lol # Boomer does n't wan na wear a mask in the store ; so he then Assaults the Employee and Trips and Falls # KarensStrikeAgain # KarensGoneWild # Karens pic.twitter.com/W2dtL4AnD9 \u2014 Chad of the CHAZ ( @ RealSaleemJuma ) June 21 , 2020\nWhile the antagonists are different , the message is the same : These people believe masks aren \u2019 t necessary and that they have the right to flagrantly disregard public health advice and guidelines .\nTheir frustration with masks seems to stem from the ongoing conservative politicization of masks as a liberal affectation having no basis in science . According to a June 25 Pew Research poll , 71 percent of Americans say we should wear masks in public either most of the time or always . But it splits on a partisan level . Pew reported :\nDemocrats and Democratic-leaning independents are about twice as likely as Republicans and Republican leaners to say that masks should be worn always ( 63 % vs. 29 % ) . Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to say that masks should rarely or never be worn ( 23 % vs. 4 % ) . Republicans also are less likely than Democrats to say they have worn masks in stores or other businesses always or most of the time in the past month .\nThis happens in spite of directives and pleas from epidemiologists , doctors , nurses , scientists , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , and the World Health Organization to continue wearing masks , continue washing your hands , and continue to practice social distance to help curb the spread of the coronavirus . It \u2019 s also happening as several states in the US report record-breaking numbers of new cases .\nThe shoppers-gone-wild videos make examples of these people , and are often accompanied by headlines like \u201c Maskless \u2018 Karen \u2019 coughs on complaining customer in Queens bagel shop \u201d and \u201c 8 Karens and Kens who threw huge tantrums instead of putting on masks. \u201d Their popularity and millions of views make it seem like everyone is on the same page about why this behavior is bad .\n\u201c I share this to say please choose kindness in these situations . Look out for one another like patrons who took this video and asked if I was okay , \u201d Ally Goodbaum , a videographer who captured the \u201c maskless Karen \u201d who began coughing on her , wrote on Facebook in June . \u201c I know there are bigger problems in the nation right now but more and more it seems the people who are just trying to stand up for the right things are getting bulldozed by bullies . \u201d\nBut if the meltdown content \u2019 s pro-mask agenda was effective , you \u2019 d think there \u2019 d be less and less of this behavior and less and less footage of it as time went on . The videos would have stopped after the first berserker got famous . Instead , there seem to be new ones posted every day .\nIt turns out , as satisfying as it is to watch someone reprimanded for bad behavior , the videos themselves might not be an effective tool to change attitudes toward public health . And according to health and behavior experts , changing someone \u2019 s mind about masks is much more difficult than embarrassing them on candid camera .\nTo fully understand these freakouts and the reactions they inspire means understanding the emotional state we \u2014 regardless of political affiliation \u2014 are all in . For the past four months , we \u2019 ve dealt with an entirely new reality wrapped around a deadly threat that we still don \u2019 t fully comprehend . That takes a toll on us emotionally , and we \u2019 re constantly coping with it .\n\u201c From a psychological point of view , when there \u2019 s a massive unknown new threat , humans \u2019 survival instinct triggers and they become highly vigilant and emotional , \u201d David Abrams , a professor of social and behavioral sciences at the NYU School of Global Public Health , told me . \u201c You have the rug pulled from under you , and suddenly your instinct is immediately to become hyperalert . And as that adrenaline pumps , you get into what we call the fight or flight \u2014 an emotional response that overrides cool-headed rationality . \u201d\nIn my home , it manifested as copious amounts of dessert-scented hand soap ( at the time , Bath & Body Works was one of the few places with stock ) and learning how to cook caramelized shallot pasta . This was , as Abrams explained to me , completely natural .\n\u201c When [ fight or flight in response to a threat ] happens , you fall back on your instincts , \u201d he said . \u201c You become hypersensitive to messages from other people . You look around at what other people are doing and what your leaders are saying . You become a copycat to quickly latch onto something that someone else is doing . And you \u2019 re highly vulnerable because of your hypervigilance , and the threat is urgent . \u201d\nAn example Abrams cited was 9/11 . After it occurred , we began \u2014 for better and worse \u2014 trusting our leaders and following new social rules like enhanced security screenings at airports . I still remember when we were allowed to walk our loved ones to the gate .\nThe key part of Abrams \u2019 s explanation , though , is that the virus isn \u2019 t as concrete as a human terrorist \u2014 it certainly doesn \u2019 t win a moral victory when you put on a mask \u2014 and that in 2020 America , we all have different ideas about who we determine to be leaders .\nFollowing leadership cues can be helpful ; those who see health officials and medical experts as leaders then copycat behavior that stamps down on the virus , like thoroughly washing hands , social distancing , and wearing masks .\nIt also works the other way . That \u2019 s what makes , as Abrams cited , Vice President Mike Pence \u2019 s maskless visit to the Mayo Clinic in April so important . Those who see him as a leader copy that behavior . Add to that other leaders who don \u2019 t wear masks and the predominantly conservative rhetoric about how they aren \u2019 t useful ( see : Trump , Donald ) and it undermines the legitimacy and importance of health officials \u2019 advice .\nWhile following cues from those we trust isn \u2019 t the only determining factor in what kind of behavior we display , it \u2019 s a powerful one . Other factors , as sociologists and epidemiologists told me , include one \u2019 s sense of community , shifting social norms , and personal experiences ( like losing a loved one to the virus ) .\nOur own behaviors then become the same ones we want to see reflected in the world around us . And when they don \u2019 t , it sets up a clash .\nThe videos of people without masks freaking out , people in masks reacting to said freakouts , and the urge to share these clips all stem from what some sociologists believe is a release for all the frustration , hypervigilance , uncertainty , and stress that we \u2019 ve accumulated since the original lockdowns in March .\n\u201c Frustration leads to anger ; it leads to resentment , \u201d Gary Fine , a sociology professor at Northwestern University , told me , explaining that because the virus isn \u2019 t tangible and the threat is invisible , it leads to humans lashing out at the most concrete target : each other . For people who hate masks , this means flying into a rage at those who encourage wearing them . For people who have made the commitment to masks , this may mean recording or watching the unmasked in an embarrassing situation .\n\u201c So say you \u2019 re in a state of frustration , and you see someone who is doing something that you find unappealing , whatever that may be . Because we have cellphones with cameras in them , we can take these videos and we have social media and we can post those videos , \u201d he continued .\nThe spectacle of the maskless throwing temper tantrums and getting thrown out of stores appeals to individuals and groups who generally wear masks because it feels like a little bit of justice . The videos also affirm a sense of in-group superiority , as both Abrams and Fine explained . They confirm to one group ( mask wearers ) that the other group ( people who don \u2019 t wear masks ) is incorrect . But aside from whatever karmic itch these videos might scratch , they \u2019 re largely ineffective at changing anyone \u2019 s behavior .\nEpidemiologists like Jared Baeten , the vice dean of the School of Public Health and professor of global health , medicine , and epidemiology at the University of Washington , know that shaming someone into acting \u201c better \u201d doesn \u2019 t really work .\nBaeten \u2019 s background is in HIV . The HIV and AIDS pandemic ( which still affects thousands of Americans today ) is often used as an analogy when talking about the coronavirus because they \u2019 re both national infectious disease emergencies , and because of the emphasis on prevention . For both the coronavirus and HIV , experts prescribe a set of behaviors to curb the spread .\n\u201c An antagonistic argument with someone about wearing or not wearing a mask is not going to be successful \u201d\nAnd one of the most important lessons gleaned from that pandemic is that shaming was detrimental .\n\u201c An antagonistic argument with someone about wearing or not wearing a mask is not going to be successful , \u201d Baeten told me . In the AIDS crisis , the corollary to masks could be condoms , which researchers learned were more successful when education didn \u2019 t stigmatize individuals . \u201c [ Effective ] HIV prevention is much more about self-empowerment , individual decision-making , pleasure with safety than it was about dirty and shaming and bad . Scolding is a generally difficult public health strategy . \u201d\nThe problem with scolding and shame , according to all the experts I spoke to , is that individuals respond with resentment and anger . Those emotions are closely tied to defiance and withdrawal . It \u2019 s not unlike the research that shaming and scolding children is ultimately not very effective in changing behavior .\n\u201c It \u2019 s hurtful . It \u2019 s hurtful to the individual , \u201d Barun Mathema , an assistant professor of epidemiology at Columbia \u2019 s Mailman School of Public Health , told me . \u201c And it perhaps may have the opposite effect . I think we should sort of steer away from more caustic strategies of trying to force people into doing A or B . We know these sort of approaches don \u2019 t really work very effectively . \u201d\nThe benchmark public health officials want to hit with not just mask-wearing but all the other coronavirus precautions is for these behaviors to become a social norm . The tipping point of when something becomes a social norm has been a key , historically , in terms of public health .\nThe more we learned about the deadly effects of cigarettes , the more we acted to curb smoking . When it was more socially acceptable , Americans pushed back against mandates that banned smoking in restaurants and bars . But that shifted to a point where not smoking became the dominant norm .\n\u201c Smoking today is not viewed the way it perhaps was in the \u2019 80s or \u2019 90s , \u201d Mathema said . \u201c I wouldn \u2019 t say it was necessarily social shaming , but social acceptability , right ? I think that has an impact on behavior . \u201d\nSeat belts , which Mathema also points to , went through a similar cultural tipping point ( \u201c Before a federal mandate came along , and even when that came along , there were a lot of people who said , \u2018 I don \u2019 t want to be strapped down . It \u2019 s my choice , \u2019 \u201d he explains ) , but smoking is perhaps a closer corollary . If I don \u2019 t wear my seat belt and I \u2019 m in an accident , it doesn \u2019 t really affect the person in the other car who \u2019 s wearing theirs . But if I \u2019 m smoking and exposing others to secondhand smoke , that may be more akin to spreading the virus .\nThe difficult thing for public health officials is that initiatives like seat belts and anti-smoking campaigns took a long time to get where they are today . They didn \u2019 t happen overnight . The coronavirus , on the other hand , needs to be dealt with immediately . States throughout the country are reporting record numbers of infection . And epidemiologists and medical experts are being asked to help get this message across to the public in a compressed amount of time .\nAll the experts I spoke to pretty much said the same thing when it comes to changing someone \u2019 s mind about masks and public health in general : You have to be the bigger person , and you have to be empathetic .\nShaming someone into behaving better , while satisfying , doesn \u2019 t work . People respond better when they feel good and are respected . That means earnestly listening to someone \u2019 s concerns and their experiences .\n\u201c You have to give a lot of people the benefit of the doubt , right ? That if given all the right sort of information and the right context , people may come up with very similar decisions , \u201d Mathema told me . \u201c Personal circumstances are also very important . Are you talking to somebody who \u2019 s just lost a job ? Who \u2019 s very stressed out ? Or somebody who strongly believes in XYZ because of these reasons ? \u201d\n\u201c You have to give a lot of people the benefit of the doubt \u201d\nAn example : For the past few months of the pandemic , a narrative from right-wing pundits emerged pitting public health against the economy . Economic hardship then becomes tethered to public health , and it \u2019 s not unreasonable for someone who believes in this narrative to resent public health when facing economic hardship . Someone being laid off from their job because of the coronavirus could possibly see it as the fault of public health officials . And listening to and understanding that is part of the way you can talk to them .\n\u201c When I do my teaching , I like to ask , \u2018 What \u2019 s the basis of the question ? What \u2019 s inspiring you ? What \u2019 s the context of the question ? \u2019 \u201d Mathema said . \u201c And then I ask myself , \u2018 How can I now use that context to sort of nudge the person to see one way or the other ? \u2019 And certainly , to empower them to make those decisions . Again , I think that \u2019 s a really important point . \u201d\nThe difficult thing for all of us \u2014 and for public health officials especially \u2014 is that we might not be in the right time , space , or place where we can have those deep , thoughtful conversations with those who disagree with us .\nWe might not have the kind of relationship with someone to talk about how health officials are still learning about the virus and that guidance is shifting to accommodate the new research . Or to advise them that instead of thinking of the economy and public health as antagonistic , it might be helpful to frame them as connected \u2014 that it \u2019 s not a good idea to restart the economy with a sick workforce .\nIt \u2019 s also especially difficult since we tend to gravitate to people who are generally like us and share our belief system . Changing someone \u2019 s mentality on public health requires effort and time . I suppose that \u2019 s why public health officials get paid to strategize and educate the masses .\nListening to and empathizing with people who don \u2019 t agree with you \u201c is easier said than done , \u201d Abrams , the behavior expert from NYU , said . \u201c I think you have to accept that you can \u2019 t force people to do anything . You can only be a role model and do it yourself and point to the people you admire . We shouldn \u2019 t forget that it \u2019 s about saving lives . \u201d\nEvery day at \u2588\u2588\u2588 , we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you , and our audience around the world , with information that has the power to save lives .

For the past four months, we\u2019ve dealt with an entirely new reality wrapped around a deadly threat that we still don\u2019t fully comprehend. That takes a toll on us emotionally, and we\u2019re constantly coping with it.\n\n\u201cFrom a psychological point of view, when there\u2019s a massive unknown new threat, humans\u2019 survival instinct triggers and they become highly vigilant and emotional,\u201d David Abrams, a professor of social and behavioral sciences at the NYU School of Global Public Health, told me. \u201cYou have the rug pulled from under you, and suddenly your instinct is immediately to become hyperalert. And as that adrenaline pumps, you get into what we call the fight or flight \u2014 an emotional response that overrides cool-headed rationality.\u201d\n\nThis stress manifests itself in different behaviors.\n\nIn my home, it manifested as copious amounts of dessert-scented hand soap (at the time, Bath & Body Works was one of the few places with stock) and learning how to cook caramelized shallot pasta. This was, as Abrams explained to me, completely natural.\n\n\u201cWhen [fight or flight in response to a threat] happens, you fall back on your instincts,\u201d he said. \u201cYou become hypersensitive to messages from other people. You look around at what other people are doing and what your leaders are saying. You become a copycat to quickly latch onto something that someone else is doing. And you\u2019re highly vulnerable because of your hypervigilance, and the threat is urgent.\u201d\n\nAn example Abrams cited was 9/11.

It\u2019s hurtful to the individual,\u201d Barun Mathema, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Columbia\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health, told me. \u201cAnd it perhaps may have the opposite effect. I think we should sort of steer away from more caustic strategies of trying to force people into doing A or B. We know these sort of approaches don\u2019t really work very effectively.\u201d\n\nThe benchmark public health officials want to hit with not just mask-wearing but all the other coronavirus precautions is for these behaviors to become a social norm. The tipping point of when something becomes a social norm has been a key, historically, in terms of public health.\n\nA recent example: smoking.\n\nThe more we learned about the deadly effects of cigarettes, the more we acted to curb smoking. When it was more socially acceptable, Americans pushed back against mandates that banned smoking in restaurants and bars. But that shifted to a point where not smoking became the dominant norm.\n\n\u201cSmoking today is not viewed the way it perhaps was in the \u201980s or \u201990s,\u201d Mathema said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it was necessarily social shaming, but social acceptability, right? I think that has an impact on behavior.\u201d\n\nSeat belts, which Mathema also points to, went through a similar cultural tipping point (\u201cBefore a federal mandate came along, and even when that came along, there were a lot of people who said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to be strapped down. It\u2019s my choice,\u2019\u201d he explains), but smoking is perhaps a closer corollary. If I don\u2019t wear my seat belt and I\u2019m in an accident, it doesn\u2019t really affect the person in the other car who\u2019s wearing theirs. But if I\u2019m smoking and exposing others to secondhand smoke, that may be more akin to spreading the virus.\n\nThe difficult thing for public health officials is that initiatives like seat belts and anti-smoking campaigns took a long time to get where they are today. They didn\u2019t happen overnight. The coronavirus, on the other hand, needs to be dealt with immediately. States throughout the country are reporting record numbers of infection. And epidemiologists and medical experts are being asked to help get this message across to the public in a compressed amount of time.\n\nSo how do you change someone\u2019s mind?\n\nAll the experts I spoke to pretty much said the same thing when it comes to changing someone\u2019s mind about masks and public health in general: You have to be the bigger person, and you have to be empathetic.\n\nShaming someone into behaving better, while satisfying, doesn\u2019t work. People respond better when they feel good and are respected. That means earnestly listening to someone\u2019s concerns and their experiences.\n\n\u201cYou have to give a lot of people the benefit of the doubt, right? That if given all the right sort of information and the right context, people may come up with very similar decisions,\u201d Mathema told me. \u201cPersonal circumstances are also very important. Are you talking to somebody who\u2019s just lost a job? Who\u2019s very stressed out? Or somebody who strongly believes in XYZ because of these reasons?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to give a lot of people the benefit of the doubt\u201d\n\nAn example: For the past few months of the pandemic, a narrative from right-wing pundits emerged pitting public health against the economy. Economic hardship then becomes tethered to public health, and it\u2019s not unreasonable for someone who believes in this narrative to resent public health when facing economic hardship. Someone being laid off from their job because of the coronavirus could possibly see it as the fault of public health officials. And listening to and understanding that is part of the way you can talk to them.\n\n\u201cWhen I do my teaching, I like to ask, \u2018What\u2019s the basis of the question? What\u2019s inspiring you? What\u2019s the context of the question?\u2019\u201d Mathema said. \u201cAnd then I ask myself, \u2018How can I now use that context to sort of nudge the person to see one way or the other?\u2019 And certainly, to empower them to make those decisions. Again, I think that\u2019s a really important point.\u201d\n\nThe difficult thing for all of us \u2014 and for public health officials especially \u2014 is that we might not be in the right time, space, or place where we can have those deep, thoughtful conversations with those who disagree with us.\n\nWe might not have the kind of relationship with someone to talk about how health officials are still learning about the virus and that guidance is shifting to accommodate the new research. Or to advise them that instead of thinking of the economy and public health as antagonistic, it might be helpful to frame them as connected \u2014 that it\u2019s not a good idea to restart the economy with a sick workforce.\n\nIt\u2019s also especially difficult since we tend to gravitate to people who are generally like us and share our belief system. Changing someone\u2019s mentality on public health requires effort and time. I suppose that\u2019s why public health officials get paid to strategize and educate the masses.\n\nListening to and empathizing with people who don\u2019t agree with you \u201cis easier said than done,\u201d Abrams, the behavior expert from NYU, said. \u201cI think you have to accept that you can\u2019t force people to do anything. You can only be a role model and do it yourself and point to the people you admire. We shouldn\u2019t forget that it\u2019s about saving lives.\u201d\n\nSupport Vox\u2019s explanatory journalism\n\nEvery day at Vox, we aim to answer your most important questions and provide you, and our audience around the world, with information that has the power to save lives.
