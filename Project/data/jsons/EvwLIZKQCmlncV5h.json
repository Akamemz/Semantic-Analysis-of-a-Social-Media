Republican views have really changed over the last eight years . `` Twenty percent of Republicans in 2006 thought the US should stay out of world affairs . That has now doubled to 40 percent . `` Americans generally are still not isolationist and want the US to continue projecting leadership abroad , by 58 percent , and 83 percent believe the U.S. should keep a strong world leadership role . But Americans ' sense of what that involves is more toward sanctions , by 65 percent , and diplomatic engagement than in asserting military power , the CCGA survey notes.Even as President Barack Obama is urging Congress to support Syrian rebels in the battle against the Islamic State ( ISIS ) , only 17 percent of Americans support sending U.S. troops to Syria and just 25 percent support arming Syrian rebels , while 70 percent oppose it . Only 30 percent would support U.S. military involvement in the Russian invasion of the Ukraine . `` This growing desire among Americans to 'stay out ' of world affairs is linked to increased criticism of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , a decreased sense of threat , a long-standing desire to focus on domestic problems and an increased divide among Republicans on this question , '' the survey states.Americans , however , would support military involvement to stop Iran from becoming a nuclear power , at 69 percent , and 56 percent support using U.S. troops to attack terrorist camps , while 71 percent would use U.S. troops to stop genocide.Americans consider a massive cyberattack on the United States to be the biggest threat , at 69 percent , while only 60 percent see global terrorism as the country 's major threat , which is a major drop from 90 percent right after 9/11 . `` Most important is the collapse in Republican opinion with regard to the Iraq and particularly the Afghan war , '' Daalder told MSNBC . `` In 2007 , 85 percent of Republicans thought the Afghanistan war was still worth the cost . That is now down to the mid-20s , and it 's similar with Iraq . About 70 percent of Republicans thought the war was worth it in 2007 . It 's now down to 40 percent . `` You see a disillusionment , particularly in the Republican Party , with these two wars , which is translating into war weariness . Republicans are now becoming where Democrats have been for a long time , and indeed where independents are .
