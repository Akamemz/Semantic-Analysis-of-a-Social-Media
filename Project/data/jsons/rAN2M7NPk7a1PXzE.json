    "content": "In a confounding election season where voters hold deep reservations about the likely Republican and Democratic nominees , the third-party Libertarian ticket has a rare chance this year to be more than a footnote in the presidential race .\nAnd that chance \u2013 to absorb disaffected voters who have little interest in picking \u2018 Trump \u2019 or \u2018 Clinton \u2019 this November \u2013 is raising the stakes for the national convention starting Friday where activists with the oft-sidelined movement will choose their nominee .\n\u201c There is a huge opportunity in this election cycle , \u201d Libertarian Party Chairman Nicholas Sarwark told FoxNews.com .\nFormer New Mexico Gov . Gary Johnson , heavily favored to win the Libertarian nomination , has been enjoying the spotlight lately as at least two recent polls have put him in double digits in a three-way race against Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump . One \u2588\u2588\u2588 poll showed Johnson pulling 10 percent against the two titans \u2013 not exactly in contention , but nevertheless impressive for a party that \u2019 s never garnered more than 1 percent of the vote in a presidential election .\nWhether Johnson \u2019 s numbers reflect growth among libertarians or simply a none-of-the-above choice , the candidate acknowledged in an interview with FoxNews.com , \u201c It \u2019 s a combination of both . \u201d\nBut , presuming he can snag the nod at the Memorial Day weekend convention , which starts Friday and wraps up Monday in Orlando , Johnson indicated he \u2019 ll happily fill the role of Trump/Clinton alternative at a time when some voters are seeking out a third-party option . Delegates will nominate a candidate Sunday .\n\u201c The nominee for the Libertarian Party is going to be the only third party candidate on the ballot in all 50 states , \u201d he said . \u201c I jokingly say that if Mickey Mouse were [ the ] third name in any polls , the recognizable figure that he is , [ he ] would be at 30 percent . But Mickey is not on the ballot in all 50 states . \u201d\nWhile prominent conservatives have floated the idea of a new third party , state ballot access will indeed be a challenge . As Johnson says , the Libertarian Party \u2013 already on 32 state ballots \u2013 will likely be on all 50 state ballots by November .\nUpping his potential appeal to # NeverTrump Republicans , Johnson tapped another former GOP governor , William Weld of Massachusetts , to be his running mate , both fiscal conservatives and social liberals .\n\u201c If conservative means smaller government , I think we are the proven commodity , \u201d Johnson said .\nHe is still short of the needed 15 percent to qualify for the presidential debates . But he believes if he \u2019 s in the debates , the ticket could collect electoral votes .\n\u201c I would not be doing this if there wasn \u2019 t the opportunity to actually win , \u201d Johnson said . \u201c New Mexico , Utah , Wyoming , Alaska , there are some real opportunities . \u201d\nThe 15 percent debate threshold may be reachable . His standing in the \u2588\u2588\u2588 poll was consistent with a Monmouth University poll in March that showed him at 11 percent . If the numbers hold , Johnson would far exceed third-party candidate Ralph Nader \u2019 s 3 percent in 2000 , but still lag behind Ross Perot \u2019 s 19 percent in 1992 .\nJohnson \u2019 s optimism about actually winning is tempered by reality and history . Not only does the party have a poor track record in general elections , but Johnson \u2019 s poll numbers haven \u2019 t always held up either . In the 2012 general election \u2013 when Johnson initially ran as a Republican and later as a Libertarian -- he polled at about 4 percent during the campaign but ended up getting less than 1 percent of the popular vote .\nStill , the 1.2 million votes represented a record for a Libertarian , and if the party can build on that this year , it could be enough to at least influence the outcome in November \u2013 though whether the candidate draws votes away from the GOP or Democratic nominee remains to be seen .\n\u201c A group of Republicans feel their party \u2019 s nomination was stolen from them by a reality TV star . A group of Democrats that supported Bernie Sanders don \u2019 t want to support a war hawk , who supports the racist war on drugs and has been a corporate shill , \u201d he said .\nLast week , Weld made waves by comparing Trump \u2019 s deportation policy to Nazi tactics . But Johnson said they were not holding back on Clinton either , and are reaching out to disaffected Sanders supporters .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think there is any question that if Hillary is elected , government is going to expand . With regard to military and foreign policy , she has been an architect , \u201d Johnson said . \u201c Is anything going to change with regards to foreign policy ? No . \u201d\nAbout 1,000 delegates are expected to gather in Orlando . The top contenders are Johnson , anti-virus software developer John McAfee and libertarian media publisher Austin Petersen , and 15 other candidates .\n\u201c If Johnson does not win on the first round , it will be mine , \u201d McAfee told FoxNews.com in an email .\nJohnson likely isn \u2019 t guaranteed a first ballot victory , said William Irwin , the chairman of the philosophy department at King \u2019 s College , who has written books on libertarianism , most recently \u201c Free Dakota . \u201d\n\u201c Some predicted the libertarian moment has passed .
