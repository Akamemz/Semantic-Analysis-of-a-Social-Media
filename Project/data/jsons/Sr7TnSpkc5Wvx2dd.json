The provision , inserted into an annual budget bill by Cuomo \u2019 s aides , created one of the nation \u2019 s most explicit immunity protections for healthcare industry officials , according to legal experts .\nNew York enlists 'army ' of contact tracers to beat coronavirus \u2013 but will it work ? Read more\nCritics say Cuomo removed a key deterrent against nursing home and hospital corporations cutting corners in ways that jeopardize lives . As those critics now try to repeal the provision during this final week of Albany \u2019 s legislative session , they assert that data prove such immunity is correlating to higher nursing home death rates during the pandemic \u2013 both in New York and in other states enacting similar immunity policies .\nNew York has become one of the globe \u2019 s major pandemic hotspots \u2013 and the center of the state \u2019 s outbreak has been nursing homes , where more than 5,000 New Yorkers have died , according to Associated Press data .\nThose deaths have occurred as Cuomo \u2019 s critics say he has taken a hands-off approach to regulating the healthcare industry interests that helped bankroll his election campaign . In March , Cuomo \u2019 s administration issued an order that allowed nursing homes to readmit sick patients without testing them for Covid-19 . Amid allegations of undercounted casualties , the governor also pushed back against pressure to have state regulators more stringently record and report death rates in nursing homes .\nAnd then came Cuomo \u2019 s annual budget \u2013 which included a little-noticed passage shielding corporate officials who run New York hospitals , nursing homes and other healthcare facilities from liability for Covid-related deaths and injuries .\nGNYHA \u2013 a lobbying group for hospital systems , including some that own nursing homes \u2013 said it \u201c drafted and aggressively advocated for \u201d the immunity provision . The new law declares that top officials at hospital and nursing home companies \u201c shall have immunity from any liability , civil or criminal , for any harm or damages alleged to have been sustained as a result of an act or omission in the course of arranging for or providing healthcare services \u201d to address the Covid-19 outbreak .\nPrior to the budget language , Cuomo had already temporarily granted limited legal immunity to doctors and nurses serving on the medical frontlines . But the carefully sculpted passage buried in the state \u2019 s annual spending bill expanded that by offering extensive immunity to any \u201c healthcare facility administrator , executive , supervisor , board member , trustee or other person responsible for directing , supervising or managing a healthcare facility and its personnel or other individual in a comparable role \u201d .\nNew York is now one of just two states to shield those corporate officials from both civil lawsuits and some forms of criminal prosecution by the government , according to an analysis by Syracuse University law professor Nina Kohn and the University of Houston \u2019 s Jessica L Roberts .\n\u201c New York is an outlier and has the most explicit and sweeping immunity language , \u201d Kohn said .\nCuomo \u2019 s administration said the new immunity provision \u2013 which is a narrow version of a broader proposal championed by the Senate Republican leader , Mitch McConnell \u2013 is necessary .\n\u201c This pandemic remains an unprecedented public health crisis and we had to realign New York \u2019 s entire healthcare system , using every type of facility to prepare for the surge , and recruiting more than 96,000 volunteers \u2013 25,000 from out of state , to help fight this virus , \u201d said Cuomo \u2019 s senior adviser Rich Azzopardi in an emailed statement . \u201c These volunteers are good samaritans and what was passed by 111 members of the legislature was an expansion of the existing Good Samaritan Law to apply to the emergency that coronavirus created . If we had not done this , these volunteers wouldn \u2019 t have been accepted and we never would have had enough frontline healthcare workers . \u201d\nNew York is an outlier and has the most explicit and sweeping immunity language Nina Kohn\nDemocratic assemblyman Ron Kim said that \u201c the language of the [ immunity ] bill and the entire proposal was drafted , submitted , and negotiated into law by Governor Andrew Cuomo and his staff \u201d . He is leading 14 New York lawmakers in pushing legislation to repeal the language \u2013 and some of them assert that the immunity provisions are linked to higher death rates in nursing homes .\n\u201c It is now apparent that negligence by administrators and executives of nursing homes has occurred at an extraordinary degree , \u201d proponents of the legislation argued in a memo accompanying the bill . \u201c [ The immunity law ] egregiously uses severe liability standards as a means to insulate healthcare facilities and specifically , administrators and executives of such facilities , from any civil or criminal liability for negligence . Repealing this article is a much-needed step to holding healthcare administrators accountable and doing everything possible to stop even more preventable deaths from happening . \u201d\nGNYHA has framed its push for liability protections as an effort to defend workers . In a 2 April memo to its members , the association wrote : \u201c You and your heroic workers have enough to agonize over without having to worry about liability for decisions and actions made under extraordinarily challenging circumstances . \u201d\nBy contrast , opponents of the legislation contend that Cuomo \u2019 s language immunizing executives from civil and criminal litigation is designed to make it easier for nursing home corporations to profit off unsafe business practices .\n\u201c The reason why neglect happens in nursing homes is executives make business decisions that result in the frontline workers not having the tools \u2013 in nursing homes , the manpower \u2013 to deliver the services those workers are trained to deliver , \u201d said plaintiffs \u2019 attorney Andrew G Finkelstein , a managing partner at Jacoby & Meyers .\n\u201c These executives choose how much staffing will be in a nursing home and they know the more staffing that they put in , the more safe the nursing home will be \u2013 but the less profits they will make , \u201d Finkelstein said . \u201c When you remove their liability from that choice , the net effect will be less and less staffing and more and more neglect in nursing homes , because those decision-makers will know there will be no legal consequences for the decisions they make . \u201d\nThe immunity provision in Cuomo \u2019 s budget came 18 months after the GNYHA delivered $ 1.25m to the Cuomo-controlled New York State Democratic committee that was supporting the governor \u2019 s re-election bid . The money went to the committee \u2019 s so-called housekeeping account . The account , which can accept unlimited donations , is meant to support general party activities but has also been used to promote Cuomo and his agenda in television ads , including in his 2018 re-election campaign .\nThe GNYHA donations \u2013 which were a huge increase from prior years \u2013 made the group one of the New York Democratic party \u2019 s largest contributors during Cuomo \u2019 s campaign . Three of the hospital association \u2019 s top officials separately gave more than $ 150,000 to Cuomo \u2019 s campaign between 2015 and 2018 .\nIn all , during the governor \u2019 s second term , Cuomo \u2019 s campaign and his state party committee raked in more than $ 2.3m from hospital and nursing home industry donors and their lobbying firms , according to data compiled by the National Institute on Money in Politics .\nAzzopardi said the Cuomo administration \u2019 s decision to insert the language into the budget was not a reflection of lobbyists \u2019 influence .\n\u201c This law was intended to increase capacity and provide quality care , and any suggestion otherwise is simply outrageous , \u201d he said .\nGNYHA paid $ 60,000 to the MirRam Group in March and April , according to the firm \u2019 s report . John Emrick , a lobbyist at the firm who previously served as the chief of staff for the controversial Independent Democratic Conference state senate caucus , disclosed lobbying the Senate majority leader \u2019 s office on \u201c safe staffing \u201d and \u201c medical malpractice \u201d .\nAnother GNYHA lobby firm is Bolton-St Johns , which gave Cuomo \u2019 s campaign $ 40,000 during his 2018 re-election . That firm employs Giorgio DeRosa , Joseph DeRosa , and Jessica Davos \u2013 the father , brother and sister of Cuomo \u2019 s top aide , Melissa DeRosa , who is secretary to the governor . Giorgio DeRosa is described on Bolton \u2019 s website as a partner and the firm \u2019 s \u201c chief Albany lobbyist \u201d . GNYHA pays the firm $ 24,000 a month to lobby on \u201c budget/appropriations \u201d issues , according to state records .\nThe governor \u2019 s office has said Melissa DeRosa has been \u201c strategizing with hospital leadership and business executives across the state to ensure frontline workers have the resources they need \u201d .\nWhile Azzopardi acknowledged in an email that Giorgio DeRosa \u2019 s firm lobbies for GNYHA , he said : \u201c This law was intended to increase capacity and provide quality care , and any suggestion otherwise is simply outrageous . Also : Melissa did not negotiate this bill , nor did anyone at that firm lobby on it . \u201d\nGiorgio and Joseph DeRosa were listed as lobbyists in GNYHA state disclosures for many years , including when Melissa DeRosa was serving as Cuomo \u2019 s chief of staff . As of mid-2017 , the DeRosas have no longer been listed as lobbyists on the association \u2019 s disclosure forms .\nBolton-St Johns spokesperson Justin Berhaupt said in an emailed statement that \u201c Giorgio DeRosa has never worked on issues related to GNYHA .\n\u201c Historically , Bolton St Johns registered all of its lobbyists for all of its clients , \u201d Berhaupt explained . \u201c Upon Ms DeRosa becoming secretary to the governor , Bolton St Johns changed its policy and only registered Bolton St Johns \u2019 lobbyists for the specific clients they served . \u201d\nGNYHA spokesperson Brian Conway said in an emailed statement : \u201c GNYHA does not lobby on behalf of nursing homes. \u201d He added : \u201c When GNYHA lobbied for Covid-19-related immunity for hospitals and their workforce , we did not involve Bolton-St Johns . \u201d\nSince receiving large hospital and nursing home campaign donations , Cuomo has supported other legislation backed by those industries . His administration backed New York \u2019 s first increase of Medicaid reimbursement rates in more than a decade , which is expected to deliver a windfall to private healthcare facilities .\nDuring his re-election campaign , Cuomo promised that he would support requiring hospitals and nursing homes to spend more on staffing , which proponents said would improve healthcare and safety , but could also reduce corporate profit margins . The governor subsequently only initiated a study of the issue \u2013 a move that the nursing home industry \u2019 s lobbying group lauded .\nPeople are 7.5 times more likely to die from Covid-19 in states with corporate legal immunity\nAs New York \u2019 s state legislative session draws to a close this week , 14 Democratic legislators in Albany are sponsoring a bill to repeal Cuomo \u2019 s corporate immunity law . In pushing for a vote on the legislation , bill author Kim is circulating a report to other lawmakers that he says shows that liability shields are linked to higher nursing home death rates .\nTo date , 19 states have enacted some form of immunity for hospitals and nursing homes during the pandemic . Based on data reported by the New York Times , Kim \u2019 s analysis asserts that more than three-quarters of total nursing home deaths from Covid-19 come from states that have granted corporate immunity to healthcare facilities .\nThe analysis found that \u201c of the 10 states with the highest fatality rates , eight have corporate immunity and represent 93 % of all fatalities , or 63,187 deaths \u201d . The report also says the data show that \u201c states with corporate immunity saw more than three times the absolute number of fatalities than states without such immunity . The average rate of death per state is 7.5 times higher in states with corporate immunity than states with no immunity for corporations . \u201d\nIn all , the report concludes : \u201c 77 % of total deaths come from states that gave immunity to corporations who owned nursing homes and healthcare facilities ; moreover , 76 % of total nursing home deaths come from states that have legal immunity status for these facilities . \u201d\nGiving immunity to corporations in care work before the apex of a pandemic leads to higher fatalities Ron Kim\n\u201c Simply put , people are 7.5 times more likely to die from Covid-19 in states with corporate legal immunity , \u201d Kim said . \u201c Giving immunity to corporations in care work before the apex of a pandemic leads to higher fatalities . It is clear that businesses , especially nursing homes that interface with Covid-19 positive individuals , are less compelled to implement proper procedures that save lives . \u201d\nAzzopardi disputed the report \u2019 s findings , calling it a \u201c flaming hot pile of bad math and inaccurate , skewed metrics \u201d . He said the report initially overstated the per-capita death rate in the state \u2019 s nursing homes , and he questioned whether it accounts for the fact that other states may share less information than New York .\n\u201c The reality is the states cited happened to also be mainly those hardest hit east coast states that received the 3 million travelers from Europe , which brought the virus here for weeks after travel from China was blocked , greatly helping the west coast , \u201d Azzopardi said .\n\u2018 The industry gets caught with its pants down \u2026 we \u2019 re now telling them they don \u2019 t have to wear pants \u2019\nAzzopardi asserted that the new immunity law \u201c builds on NY Good Samaritan laws which say that if you provide medical help to someone at the scene of an accident in an emergency you are immune from suit \u201d .\nBut some legal experts counter that the new provision represents a significant departure from the state \u2019 s longstanding laws .\nPrior to the change , New York statutes went out of their way to declare that nursing home companies and their executives are liable for corporate misconduct . In one high-profile class action case in central New York last year , a judge denied James Square nursing home \u2019 s motion to shield owners and shareholders from liability over allegations that the company \u2019 s cost-cutting measures endangered patients .\nI don \u2019 t have a problem with giving frontline workers immunity , it is the people who make the business decisions that kill people Jeremiah Frei-Pearson\n\u201c I don \u2019 t have a problem with giving frontline workers immunity , it is the people who make the business decisions that kill people \u2013 they are the ones who have to be held personally responsible , \u201d said attorney Jeremiah Frei-Pearson , who represented James Square residents in their successful suit , which ultimately forced the company to spend more money to increase staffing at the facility . \u201c Many of the corporate owners are just trying to make money \u2013 they don \u2019 t care about the elderly people in their custody , and if you take them off the hook , they are going to do the absolute minimum , which risks lives . \u201d\nUnder Cuomo \u2019 s new liability shield law , that kind of ruling may be harder to secure at a time when the Trump administration has been reducing fines against nursing home operators and is now suspending safety enforcement during the pandemic .\n\u201c We \u2019 ve had a longstanding problem holding nursing homes responsible , because if you look at government enforcement , it \u2019 s typically a slap on the wrist . A private lawsuit is often all you have left to hold a nursing home accountable , \u201d said Syracuse University \u2019 s Kohn . \u201c Granting immunity sends a terrible message for the future . The industry gets caught with its pants down during the crisis , and we \u2019 re now telling them they don \u2019 t have to wear pants . \u201d\nThey could sue but now because of this immunity they can not\nAs they push to expand immunity laws across the country , the hospital and nursing home industries have continued to cast their campaign as a necessary defense of medical workers .\n\u201c As our care providers make these difficult decisions , they need to know they will not be prosecuted or persecuted , \u201d said an emblematic letter from industry groups pressing California \u2019 s governor , Gavin Newsom , to issue an executive order shielding them from legal liability .\nAnd yet Kohn \u2019 s research shows that 16 out of the 19 states that created liability protections extended immunity to both individual workers and nursing home facilities as a whole . New York \u2013 unlike many other states \u2013 explicitly extended the immunity to company executives and corporate board members who are not on the frontlines , but who are making key budget and staffing decisions that affect workers and patients .\nKim says that the expansion beyond healthcare workers is not an accident \u2013 he said it deliberately \u201c discourages medical staff and frontline workers in nursing homes from safely coming out against malpractices they might observe from executive leadership \u201d .\nThat assertion was echoed by University of Wyoming law professor Michael Duff , one of the nation \u2019 s leading experts on workplace law . He said that while the change does not modify traditional workers \u2019 compensation protections for hospital or nursing home employees , it could reduce the legal rights of contract workers to demand better safety protections at precisely the moment that healthcare facilities are outsourcing work to third-party staffing firms .\n\u201c Often medical personnel in operating rooms and emergency areas are contracted out [ and ] the same often goes for groups like janitorial services , \u201d said Duff , a former National Labor Relations Board investigator . \u201c Ordinarily , employees of the institutions would be unable to sue because of workers \u2019 compensation exclusive remedy rule . But independent contractors aren \u2019 t bound by that rule . They could sue but now because of this immunity they can not . \u201d\nFor its part , the Cuomo administration has struck a defiant tone . During a televised press conference this weekend , DeRosa suggested that New York \u2019 s nursing-home casualty rates are not anomalously high \u2013 and she argued that the state \u2019 s \u201c confirmed \u201d death rates are in line with other states , though others have asserted that the state has been undercounting nursing home casualties .\nMeanwhile , Cuomo has enlisted titans to lead a 15-member commission focused on \u201c reimagining \u201d New York and its public policies . Among the panel members is Northwell Health \u2019 s CEO , Michael Dowling , whose company operates two New York nursing homes where there have been Covid-related deaths .\nNorthwell Health is a member of the hospital association that lobbied for the immunity provisions , and Dowling is a Cuomo donor .",

John Emrick, a lobbyist at the firm who previously served as the chief of staff for the controversial Independent Democratic Conference state senate caucus, disclosed lobbying the Senate majority leader\u2019s office on \u201csafe staffing\u201d and \u201cmedical malpractice\u201d.\n\nAnother GNYHA lobby firm is Bolton-St Johns, which gave Cuomo\u2019s campaign $40,000 during his 2018 re-election.

The average rate of death per state is 7.5 times higher in states with corporate immunity than states with no immunity for corporations.\u201d\n\nIn all, the report concludes: \u201c77% of total deaths come from states that gave immunity to corporations who owned nursing homes and healthcare facilities; moreover, 76% of total nursing home deaths come from states that have legal immunity status for these facilities.\u201d\n\nGiving immunity to corporations in care work before the apex of a pandemic leads to higher fatalities Ron Kim\n\n\u201cSimply put, people are 7.5 times more likely to die from Covid-19 in states with corporate legal immunity,\u201d Kim said. \u201cGiving immunity to corporations in care work before the apex of a pandemic leads to higher fatalities. It is clear that businesses, especially nursing homes that interface with Covid-19 positive individuals, are less compelled to implement proper procedures that save lives.\u201d\n\nAzzopardi disputed the report\u2019s findings, calling it a \u201cflaming hot pile of bad math and inaccurate, skewed metrics\u201d. He said the report initially overstated the per-capita death rate in the state\u2019s nursing homes, and he questioned whether it accounts for the fact that other states may share less information than New York.\n\n\u201cThe reality is the states cited happened to also be mainly those hardest hit east coast states that received the 3 million travelers from Europe, which brought the virus here for weeks after travel from China was blocked, greatly helping the west coast,\u201d Azzopardi said.\n\n\u2018The industry gets caught with its pants down \u2026 we\u2019re now telling them they don\u2019t have to wear pants\u2019\n\nAzzopardi asserted that the new immunity law \u201cbuilds on NY Good Samaritan laws which say that if you provide medical help to someone at the scene of an accident in an emergency you are immune from suit\u201d.\n\nBut some legal experts counter that the new provision represents a significant departure from the state\u2019s longstanding laws.\n\nPrior to the change, New York statutes went out of their way to declare that nursing home companies and their executives are liable for corporate misconduct. In one high-profile class action case in central New York last year, a judge denied James Square nursing home\u2019s motion to shield owners and shareholders from liability over allegations that the company\u2019s cost-cutting measures endangered patients.\n\nI don\u2019t have a problem with giving frontline workers immunity, it is the people who make the business decisions that kill people Jeremiah Frei-Pearson\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with giving frontline workers immunity, it is the people who make the business decisions that kill people \u2013 they are the ones who have to be held personally responsible,\u201d said attorney Jeremiah Frei-Pearson, who represented James Square residents in their successful suit, which ultimately forced the company to spend more money to increase staffing at the facility. \u201cMany of the corporate owners are just trying to make money \u2013 they don\u2019t care about the elderly people in their custody, and if you take them off the hook, they are going to do the absolute minimum, which risks lives.\u201d\n\nUnder Cuomo\u2019s new liability shield law, that kind of ruling may be harder to secure at a time when the Trump administration has been reducing fines against nursing home operators and is now suspending safety enforcement during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a longstanding problem holding nursing homes responsible, because if you look at government enforcement, it\u2019s typically a slap on the wrist. A private lawsuit is often all you have left to hold a nursing home accountable,\u201d said Syracuse University\u2019s Kohn. \u201cGranting immunity sends a terrible message for the future. The industry gets caught with its pants down during the crisis, and we\u2019re now telling them they don\u2019t have to wear pants.\u201d\n\nThey could sue but now because of this immunity they cannot\n\nAs they push to expand immunity laws across the country, the hospital and nursing home industries have continued to cast their campaign as a necessary defense of medical workers.\n\n\u201cAs our care providers make these difficult decisions, they need to know they will not be prosecuted or persecuted,\u201d said an emblematic letter from industry groups pressing California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, to issue an executive order shielding them from legal liability.\n\nAnd yet Kohn\u2019s research shows that 16 out of the 19 states that created liability protections extended immunity to both individual workers and nursing home facilities as a whole. New York \u2013 unlike many other states \u2013 explicitly extended the immunity to company executives and corporate board members who are not on the frontlines, but who are making key budget and staffing decisions that affect workers and patients.\n\nKim says that the expansion beyond healthcare workers is not an accident \u2013 he said it deliberately \u201cdiscourages medical staff and frontline workers in nursing homes from safely coming out against malpractices they might observe from executive leadership\u201d.\n\nThat assertion was echoed by University of Wyoming law professor Michael Duff, one of the nation\u2019s leading experts on workplace law. He said that while the change does not modify traditional workers\u2019 compensation protections for hospital or nursing home employees, it could reduce the legal rights of contract workers to demand better safety protections at precisely the moment that healthcare facilities are outsourcing work to third-party staffing firms.\n\n\u201cOften medical personnel in operating rooms and emergency areas are contracted out [and] the same often goes for groups like janitorial services,\u201d said Duff, a former National Labor Relations Board investigator. \u201cOrdinarily, employees of the institutions would be unable to sue because of workers\u2019 compensation exclusive remedy rule. But independent contractors aren\u2019t bound by that rule. They could sue but now because of this immunity they cannot.\u201d\n\nFor its part, the Cuomo administration has struck a defiant tone. During a televised press conference this weekend, DeRosa suggested that New York\u2019s nursing-home casualty rates are not anomalously high \u2013 and she argued that the state\u2019s \u201cconfirmed\u201d death rates are in line with other states, though others have asserted that the state has been undercounting nursing home casualties.\n\nMeanwhile, Cuomo has enlisted titans to lead a 15-member commission focused on \u201creimagining\u201d New York and its public policies. Among the panel members is Northwell Health\u2019s CEO, Michael Dowling, whose company operates two New York nursing homes where there have been Covid-related deaths.\n\nNorthwell Health is a member of the hospital association that lobbied for the immunity provisions, and Dowling is a Cuomo donor.",
