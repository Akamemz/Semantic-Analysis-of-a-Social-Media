But there are reports of deep discord within his campaign , and signs of an unraveling of the party \u2019 s fragile unity that had lasted through the GOP convention in Cleveland until now . The moment is so fraught with discord that major Republicans increasingly are giving up on the party altogether .\nTrump 's most controversial move was his repeated denigration of Khizr and Ghazala Khan , the immigrant parents of a fallen Muslim-American soldier , after Mr. Khan spoke out against Trump at the Democratic National Convention last week . But it 's also an accumulation of brash moves \u2013 a daily unwillingness both to show the kind of restraint expected of a presidential candidate and to behave as a loyal Republican .\nHow has the Grand Old Party , founded in 1854 by anti-slavery activists , come to this point ? It may not be all Trump 's fault , though he personifies the problem .
