( The rally was ultimately moved to Chicago . ) Its defense of free speech , even when it qualifies as hate speech , cost the ACLU about 30,000 members \u2013 but the organization stayed consistent with a policy it held since the late 1930s .\nLast week , though , the ACLU decided to change that policy in response to a violent white supremacist protest in Charlottesville , Va . Dozens of protesters marched through the town with guns \u2013 some armed better than police , according to state officials \u2013 illustrating a troubling new challenge for First Amendment guardians : what to do now when people want to exercise their right to protest at the same time as their right to openly carry guns in public ?\n\u201c The Charlottesville events have triggered a classic American debate that has been part of our constitutional conversation for well over 100 years , \u201d says Rodney Smolla , dean of Widener University Delaware Law School .\n\u201c You have the right to engage in racist speech , and there may be a state legal right to carry a gun , but when you put the two together in a mass demonstration you create a dangerous combination , \u201d he adds .\nThe intertwining of the First and Second Amendments is not unheard of in the US ( perhaps most famously with the Black Panthers in the 1970s , which led to gun control laws being enacted in states such as California ) . Today , though , 46 states have some form of open-carry laws on the books \u2013 complicating the debate , according to legal scholars . For its part , the ACLU says it is trying to adapt to the times .\nPrior to the Charlottesville rally , the ACLU of Virginia successfully defended rally organizers when the town went to court to have it moved to a location outside the town center . The rally turned violent \u2013 with 35 people reported injured and a woman killed , police say , after a neo-Nazi sympathizer drove his car into a crowd \u2013 and was declared an unlawful assembly . Days later \u2013 after widespread public condemnation , including among its own members \u2013 the national organization announced that it will now not defend groups seeking to march with firearms .\nThey will also \u201c screen clients more closely for violence at their rallies , \u201d executive director Anthony Romero told The Wall Street Journal .\n\u201c It \u2019 s neither a blanket no or a blanket yes , \u201d Mr. Romero added , saying the ACLU will continue to deal with requests on a case-by-case basis . But the events of Charlottesville , he said , require \u201c any legal group to look at the facts of any white supremacy protests with a much finer comb . \u201d\nThe shifting legal landscape around gun rights is what makes today \u2019 s free speech debate so much tougher for groups like the ACLU , experts say .\n\u201c The simple dedication to the principles of free speech become a little more murky when people are carrying guns , \u201d says William Marshall , the Kenan Professor of Law at the University of North Carolina ( UNC ) .\n\u201c You can be a strong believer in Second Amendment rights and a strong believer in First Amendment rights , but even if you are you might want to think about how those two work together in highly volatile demonstrations , \u201d he adds .\nAhead of two protests by the self-described `` alt-right '' this weekend in California , ACLU affiliates in California released their own separate statement headlined , \u201c White Supremacist Violence Is Not Free Speech . \u201d\n\u201c If white supremacists march into our towns armed to the teeth and with the intent to harm people they are not engaging in activity protected by the United States Constitution , \u201d the statement concluded .\nIn Charlottesville , dozens of civilians carried semi-automatic weapons during the protest . Some \u201c had better equipment than our state police , \u201d Virginia Gov . Terry McAuliffe ( D ) said , while critics suggested the heavily armed protesters made police too afraid to intervene .\nBut an early consensus among free speech scholars is beginning to emerge that a protest with guns can not be treated , for First Amendment purposes , the same as a rally without guns .\n\u201c A march or rally by people who are heavily armed is not an exercise of what the First Amendment calls \u2018 the right of the people peaceably to assemble , \u2019 \u201d writes Michael Dorf , a professor at Cornell Law School in Ithaca , N.Y. , in the Take Care blog .\nAspiring protesters can \u201c as individuals , exercise their putative Second Amendment right to carry arms in public or they can , as a group , exercise their First Amendment right to peaceable assemble \u2026 in which they are not armed , \u201d he adds . \u201c The attempt to combine those two rights will , in the typical case , be unprotected . \u201d\nExactly how rallies with guns should be treated by courts remains to be seen . This legal terrain is complicated even further by the fact that there isn \u2019 t yet a definitive Supreme Court ruling regarding the right to carry guns in public .\nBoth the Heller ( 2008 ) and the McDonald ( 2010 ) decisions \u2013 the most recent Second Amendment cases heard by the high court \u2013 avoided answering whether Americans are allowed to openly carry guns in public . Last term , the justices declined to take up a case out of California that would have directly addressed it .\nSamuel Walker , an emeritus professor at the University of Nebraska and a former ACLU board member , says the ACLU needs to keep protecting free speech for even the most extreme groups because \u201c social progress has advanced in part because our law protects strong and often offensive language. \u201d But he also agrees with the new change in policy .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a new aspect of this whole ongoing controversy , \u201d says Professor Walker , author of \u201c In Defense of American Liberties , \u201d a history of the ACLU . \u201c I do not think the ACLU should defend any demonstration or march where protesters plan to carry guns . \u201d\nThe boundaries of free speech have been evolving in the United States for more than 100 years .\nPrior to World War II , the country was much tougher on offensive speech . In 1919 , the US Supreme Court ruled that speaking out against the draft was not protected by the First Amendment , and in 1942 the justices ruled that \u201c fighting words \u201d ( words that \u201c inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace \u201d ) are not protected either .\nSince then , the views of Justices Oliver Wendell Holmes and Louis Brandeis have prevailed . ( At least in the public square . In areas such as schools and government buildings there are more restrictions on free speech . ) Those justices believed \u201c that the good speech will drown out the bad speech \u201d in the \u201c marketplace of ideas , \u201d says Professor Smolla , author of \u201c Free Speech in an Open Society . \u201d\nSo as it stands , as far as the First Amendment is concerned , free speech includes hate speech . Unlike in Europe , \u201c hate speech \u201d has no legal definition in America .\nThe ACLU \u2019 s commitment to defending free speech rights is driven by the concern that carving out exceptions , even for the most repulsive language , could later be used to censor other , more acceptable , forms of speech .\nYet it \u2019 s that position that has provoked ire \u2013 even among some members \u2013 time and again . There 's also a shift among younger Americans regarding the importance of protecting offensive speech : 40 percent of Millennials believe the federal government should be able to limit speech offensive to minorities , according to a 2015 survey by the Pew Research Center .\nEven prior to Charlottesville , the ACLU had been under fire internally over its decision to defend Milo Yiannopoulos , a high-profile figure in the self-proclaimed \u201c alt right \u201d \u2013 a coalition that combines white nationalism , anti-Semitism , and populism \u2013 in a dispute with the Washington , D.C. , public transportation authority .
