Some of the shootings were suicides and others were unintentional .\nThe report was timed to coincide with the 14-month mark since a gunman went on a shooting spree at Sandy Hook Elementary School , killing 20 students and six faculty members .\nThe group said its report should prod a Congress that has shown little interest in gun control after President Obama \u2019 s failed push last year for expanded background checks and bans on some semiautomatic rifles and high-capacity ammunition magazines .\nSen. Chris Murphy , Connecticut Democrat , implied that there would be consequences at the ballot box if Congress doesn \u2019 t take the issue up again .\n\u201c As outraged as I am at this report , as angry as I am about what \u2019 s happening in Congress today , I know it will change , \u201d Mr. Murphy said . \u201c I know it will change because Congress can \u2019 t stay this far out of step with the American public for too long before democracy corrects that imbalance . \u201d\nRep.
