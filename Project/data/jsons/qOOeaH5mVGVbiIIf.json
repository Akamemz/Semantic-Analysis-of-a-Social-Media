Yes\nThe face-to-face meeting at the White House Sunday between President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner has led to analyses such as these this morning :\n-- `` The contours of a deal to avert the year-end fiscal cliff are becoming increasingly clear .

'' ( The New York Times )\n-- `` The lines are clear : Obama says a deal will not get done unless tax rates increase on top earners . Boehner says he 's opposed to tax rate increases on anyone .
