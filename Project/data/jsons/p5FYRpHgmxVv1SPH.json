    "content_original": "(Molly Riley/Reuters)\n\nIn a remarkable brief, they impugn the integrity of conservative justices and conclude with an ominous and improper warning.\n\nI just finished reading of the most astonishing legal briefs I\u2019ve ever read. It is easily the most malicious Supreme Court brief I\u2019ve ever seen. And it comes not from an angry or unhinged private citizen, but from five Democratic members of the United States Senate. Without any foundation, they directly attack the integrity of the five Republican appointees and conclude with a threat to take political action against the Court if it doesn\u2019t rule the way they demand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe brief is so outside legal norms that, had I drafted it as a member of the Supreme Court bar, I\u2019d be concerned about facing legal sanction for recklessly impugning the integrity of the Court.\n\nHere\u2019s the background. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse, Mazie Hirono, Richard Blumenthal, Richard Durbin, and Kirsten Gillibrand filed their short brief in a case called New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. the City of New York, the first Second Amendment case the Supreme Court has taken in nearly a decade.\n\nIf that sounds momentous, don\u2019t be so sure. At issue is an extremely bizarre New York City law that banned the transport of a locked, unloaded licensed handgun outside the home unless the gun owner is traveling to one of only seven shooting ranges in the city.

Read this remarkable paragraph:\n\nFrom October Term 2005 through October Term 2017, this Court issued 78 5\u20134 (or 5\u20133) opinions in which justices appointed by Republican presidents provided all five votes in the majority.

Every single time, the corporate and Republican political interests prevailed. The pattern of outcomes is striking; and so is the frequency with which these 5\u20134 majorities disregarded \u201cconservative\u201d judicial principles like judicial restraint, originalism, stare decisis, and even federalism.\n\nThe implication is plain. The conservative justices are doing the bidding of their \u201ccorporate and Republican\u201d masters. Their principles are malleable; only the results matter, and the results are dictated by the men and women who supported their confirmation and fund the litigation before the Court. \u201cThis backdrop,\u201d the senators argue, \u201cno doubt encourages petitioners\u2019 brazen confidence that this Court will be a partner in their \u2018project.\u2019\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve got a question for the senators. When progressive activist groups organize to support the confirmation of Democratic judicial nominees, are their efforts inherently suspect, and the justices they help confirm inherently tainted?\n\nThe brief ends with this ominous warning:\n\nThe Supreme Court is not well. And the people know it. Perhaps the Court can heal itself before the public demands it be \u201crestructured in order to reduce the influence of politics.\u201d Particularly on the urgent issue of gun control, a nation desperately needs it to heal.\n\nTranslation: Nice nine-person Supreme Court you have there.
