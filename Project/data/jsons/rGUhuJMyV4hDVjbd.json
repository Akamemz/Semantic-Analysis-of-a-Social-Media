Competing in a massive field of Democratic White House hopefuls , O \u2019 Rourke has sagged in the polls . He \u2019 s made few promises that resonated or produced headline-grabbing moments , instead driving around the country meeting with voters at mostly small events .\nIn a tacit recognition that this approach isn \u2019 t working , O \u2019 Rourke is planning to try again , taking a hands-on role in staging a \u201c reintroduction \u201d ahead of next month \u2019 s premier Democratic presidential debate . As he finalizes his plans , O \u2019 Rourke has entered an intentional \u201c quiet period \u201d to build out campaign infrastructure , according to an adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the campaign \u2019 s strategy .\nO \u2019 Rourke plans to step up his national media appearances after skipping most of that kind of exposure in recent months . He is scheduled to appear on MSNBC \u2019 s \u201c Rachel Maddow Show \u201d on Monday night and ABC \u2019 s \u201c The View \u201d the next day .\nHe \u2019 s also set to offer more concrete policy plans on top issues . So far , he \u2019 s issued just one , on climate change .\nO \u2019 Rourke acknowledges he \u2019 s struggled to find his presidential campaign footing .\n\u201c I think , in part , I was just trying to keep up when I first started out , \u201d he said after addressing about 40 people at a recent house party in Newton , Iowa . \u201c I really feel like I \u2019 ve found my rhythm and my pace , and I just feel comfortable , and I feel like this is what I \u2019 m supposed to be doing . \u201d\nHis top aides deny that a full reinvention or \u201c Beto 2.0 \u201d is in the works . They note that O \u2019 Rourke plans to keep packing days with as many as half a dozen campaign events . He \u2019 ll still venture into off-the-beaten path locales that include rural , heavily Republican areas . Those were the trademarks of his Senate campaign last fall , when he nearly toppled Republican Sen. Ted Cruz by visiting all of deep-red Texas \u2019 254 counties .\nBut his team also acknowledges that for all its excitement , O \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s initial campaign launch exposed some disorganization . Assembling a campaign staff while the 2020 roadshow was already rollicking along simply wasn \u2019 t sustainable .\nIt took O \u2019 Rourke nearly two weeks after announcing his campaign to formally hire Jen O \u2019 Malley Dillon to run his team . She was the deputy campaign manager of Barack Obama \u2019 s 2012 re-election bid and is only now moving to O \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s headquarters in El Paso , Texas , after doing the job from Washington .\nO \u2019 Rourke added 16 staffers recently in Iowa , which holds the first presidential caucuses , but that \u2019 s fewer than some other candidates have . In New Hampshire , which votes next , O \u2019 Rourke has yet to formally announce a state director or campaign staff , though he has informal organizers there .\n\u201c It was a ready , fire , aim sort of trajectory , \u201d said Chris Lippincott , a Texas consultant who ran an outside political group opposing Cruz in 2018 .\nKathy Sullivan , a Democratic National Committee member from New Hampshire , noted that , after events , \u201c If you don \u2019 t have somebody with a clipboard taking names and addresses and phone numbers , you can lose contact with folks . \u201d\nSullivan recently had lunch with O \u2019 Rourke in New Hampshire \u2019 s capital , Concord , as part of a small women \u2019 s group and \u201c found him to be very sincere , very thoughtful. \u201d But she also said that his falling out of the 2020 spotlight helped boost another young , unorthodox candidate : Pete Buttigieg , mayor of South Bend , Indiana .\nThe work to bolster the campaign has begun to stabilize things . Earlier this week , O \u2019 Rourke announced hiring Jeff Berman , a top delegate guru who helped Obama navigate the complicated process of locking up enough support to secure the Democratic presidential nomination .\n\u201c It has been building up over time , \u201d O \u2019 Rourke said of his campaign apparatus . \u201c I think we \u2019 re getting better organized all the time . \u201d\nHe maintains that it \u2019 s still early . During his first trip to Iowa in March , O \u2019 Rourke focused on eastern counties that had supported Obama but went for Donald Trump in 2016 . More recently , he sought out the relatively few Democrats in the state \u2019 s rural southwest , trying to do the spade work \u2014 as the country folk he \u2019 s trying to woo might say \u2014 to slowly grow lasting support .\n\u201c With 21 , maybe more , candidates on the horizon , this is going to be decided by a matter of a few hundred votes , maybe a few dozen votes , \u201d O \u2019 Rourke said after speaking at a former livestock auction space in Shenandoah , Iowa , that \u2019 s been converted into a spiffy hall for weddings and parties . \u201c So , every one of these conversations matters . \u201d\nOne holdover from O \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s do-it-yourself style in Texas is his insistence on driving himself between events , repeatedly climbing behind the wheel of rented Dodge Grand Caravans . Some campaign staffers see it as time that could be spent doing more productive \u2014 or at least less potentially dangerous \u2014 things , but O \u2019 Rourke \u2019 s unfazed .\n\u201c I can \u2019 t just sit and ride , \u201d he \u2019 s said by way of explanation . \u201c I \u2019 ve got to be doing something . \u201d\nIn the meantime , his staff has built schedules ensuring that O \u2019 Rourke gets to his multiple daily scheduled events on time \u2014 capitalizing on his energy while being mindful not to keep demanding early state voters waiting , like he did when barnstorming across all 10 New Hampshire counties in 48 hours shortly after kicking off his campaign .\nO \u2019 Rourke takes questions from attendees at every stop and is quick enough on his feet to usually provide detailed answers before pivoting to his talking points .\nMarcia Fulton , a 78-year-old retired teacher and school administrator who saw O \u2019 Rourke at a restored train depot in Creston , Iowa , said she \u2019 s not decided who she \u2019 ll vote for yet , but he \u201c was really impressive , more so than I expected . \u201d\n\u201c He was prepared and that was a real question , given his youth , \u201d Fulton added .\nBut O \u2019 Rourke also begins every stop with a rapid-fire , 20-minute stump speech decrying climate change , skyrocketing student loans and the Trump administration \u2019 s immigration policies while promising to drastically expand health insurance coverage and insisting he can achieve bipartisan cooperation in Washington .
