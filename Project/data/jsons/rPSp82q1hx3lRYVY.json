REUTERS/Jean-Paul Pelissier\n\nMacron, a former economy minister who had never previously stood for elected office, beat far-right leader Marine Le Pen by 66 percent to 34 - a gap well above the 20 or so percentage points that surveys had predicted.\n\nHelen Lhuillier, a 73-year-old French Canadian who has lived in France for 40 years and attended his supporters\u2019 victory rally outside the Louvre museum, said she liked Macron\u2019s \u201cpolicies and his personality, his enthusiasm\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat he has achieved in a year is impressive,\u201d she said, before adding: \u201cI hope he will be able to make progress, but we must be realistic.
