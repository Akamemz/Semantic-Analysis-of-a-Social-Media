But Joe Biden appears to be hobbling even before he reaches the starting blocks .\nThe past week has delivered a barrage of damaging news reports that might persuade the former vice president , long agonising over whether to make a third bid for the White House , to keep procrastinating a little while longer .\nLucy Flores , a former Nevada state assemblywoman , wrote an essay for the Cut in which she recalled a 2014 encounter in which Biden touched her shoulders , leaned in to smell her hair and kissed the back of her head . In a subsequent interview on CNN , Flores said such behavior should be \u201c disqualifying \u201d for a presidential candidate .\nBiden denies inappropriate behavior after claim he kissed Nevada lawmaker Read more\nOn Monday , a second woman came forward . Amy Lappos , a Democratic aide , told the Associated Press ( AP ) that she was at a fundraiser in Hartford , Connecticut , in 2009 when Biden \u201c wrapped both his hands around my face and pulled me in . I thought , \u2018 Oh , God , he \u2019 s going to kiss me. \u2019 Instead , he rubbed noses with me. \u201d She described him as \u201c absolutely disrespectful of my personal boundaries \u201d .\nThis setback followed a backlash last week after the Axios website reported that some of Biden \u2019 s advisers were considering linking his campaign announcement with a promise to select Stacey Abrams , a rising star who unsuccessfully ran for Georgia governor last year , as his running mate . Critics found this patronising towards an African American woman who might run for president herself . Abrams responded : \u201c You don \u2019 t run for second place . \u201d\nMeanwhile , Biden made his latest attempt to express regret for how the Senate judiciary committee , which he chaired at the time , handled Anita Hill \u2019 s sexual harassment allegations against supreme court nominee Clarence Thomas . At the Biden Courage Awards in New York , he said : \u201c To this day , I regret I couldn \u2019 t come up with a way to get her the kind of hearing she deserved. \u201d Some found the comments inadequate and called on Biden to apologise to Hill directly .\nAnd conservative media refocused attention on past reports about his son Hunter Biden \u2019 s links to a Ukrainian oligarch and natural gas company in 2014 . It has all been a brutal reminder that this 76-year-old white male centrist , though performing strongly in early polls , can take nothing for granted in a party where the energy is with women , minorities and young progressives . The 2020 election will not be fought in his comfort zone .\nWendy Schiller , a political science professor at Brown University , said : \u201c Twenty to forty-year-olds don \u2019 t know any of his history ; they only know him as Barack Obama \u2019 s vice-president .

He \u2019 s explaining himself to an electorate that doesn \u2019 t really know him .\n\u201c When he says he \u2019 s willing to consider Stacey Abrams as VP , women of colour and women in general are offended because they don \u2019 t assume she has to be number two . It \u2019 s a generational obstacle for Biden because the good stuff he \u2019 s done is unknown and the bad stuff he \u2019 s done is on video . \u201d\nSchiller added : \u201c To young people , Joe Biden is an old white guy who now , it appears , views women as less than equal and feels able to treat them inappropriately .
