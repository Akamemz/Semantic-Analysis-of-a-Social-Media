( AP Photo/Evan Vucci )\nWASHINGTON ( AP ) \u2014 In the rubble of buildings and lives , modern U.S. presidents have met national trauma with words such as these : \u201c I can hear you. \u201d \u201c You have lost too much , but you have not lost everything. \u201d \u201c We have wept with you ; we \u2019 ve pulled our children tight . \u201d\nAs diverse as they were in eloquence and empathy , George W. Bush , Bill Clinton and Barack Obama each had his own way of piercing the noise of catastrophe and reaching people .\nBut now , the known U.S. death toll from the coronavirus pandemic is fast approaching 100,000 on the watch of a president whose communication skills , potent in a political brawl , are not made for this moment .\nImpeachment placed one indelible mark on Donald Trump \u2019 s time in the White House . Now there is another , a still-growing American casualty list that has exceeded deaths from the Vietnam and Korean wars combined . U.S. fatalities from the most lethal hurricanes and earthquakes pale by comparison . This is the deadliest pandemic in a century .\nActual deaths from COVID-19 are almost certainly higher than the numbers show , an undercount to be corrected in time .\nAt every turn Trump has asserted the numbers would be worse without his leadership . Yet the toll keeps climbing . It is well beyond what he told people to expect even as his public-health authorities started bracing the country in early April for at least 100,000 deaths .\n\u201c I think we \u2019 ll be substantially under that number , \u201d he said April 10. \u201c Ten days later : \u201d We \u2019 re going toward 50- or 60,000 people. \u201d Ten days after that : \u201c We \u2019 re probably heading to 60,000 , 70,000. \u201d Though critics have said the toll shot up because he was slow to respond , he contended Tuesday it could have been 25 times higher without his actions .\nThe scale and swiftness of the pandemic \u2019 s killing are unlike anything that confronted Trump \u2019 s recent predecessors . Yet the calamity offers no where-were-you moment \u2014 no flashpoint turning blue skies black , no fusillade at an elementary school . Instead the toll unfolds in stages of sickness .\nThe pandemic is playing out in a divided country under a president who thrives on rousing his supporters and getting a rise out of those who don \u2019 t like him , whether that means forgoing a mask , playing golf while millions hunker down or thrashing opponents on Twitter . He lowered flags to half staff to recognize those who have died from the virus but had them back up days before the 100,000 marker was reached .\nHis feelings on Tuesday ? He tweeted to \u201c all the political hacks out there \u201d that without his leadership the lives lost would be far worse than the \u201c 100,000 plus that looks like will be the number . \u201d\nEarly on , when only a few hundred had died , Trump was asked at a briefing what message he had for Americans who were scared . \u201c You \u2019 re a terrible reporter , that \u2019 s what I say , \u201d he responded . \u201c I think it \u2019 s a very nasty question . \u201d\nIn the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing , the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook school and other national nightmares that brought flags to half staff , presidents found more soothing words for the frightened and grieving than Trump \u2019 s boilerplate line that one death is too many .\nEmpathy was Clinton \u2019 s wheelhouse . The rhetorically fumbly Bush grabbed eloquence by the bullhorn . The cool and controlled Obama cried .\nTrump ? \u201c I \u2019 ve never seen a president with less capacity for empathy , \u201d said Andrew J. Polsky , a political science professor at Hunter College , City University of New York , who has studied such leadership traits for decades . \u201c He doesn \u2019 t even try . ... It \u2019 s way outside his emotional comfort zone . \u201d\nClinton \u2019 s touchy-feely ways are forever symbolized by his assurance that \u201c I feel your pain , \u201d which did not come from a tragic moment at all but rather an epic smackdown of a heckler . Challenged by an AIDS activist in New York in 1992 who said the Democratic candidate was more about ambition than achievement , Clinton told the man \u201c I know how it hurts ... I feel your pain \u201d but \u201c quit talking to me like that . \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 m sick and tired of all these people who don \u2019 t know me , know nothing about my life ... making snotty-nosed remarks about how I haven \u2019 t done anything in my life , \u201d Clinton told the crowd and the activist .\nBut Clinton \u2019 s remarks as president at the memorial service for the victims of the Oklahoma City domestic terrorist attack in 1995 exemplified compassionate leadership and helped dig him out of a political hole .\n\u201c You have lost too much , but you have not lost everything , \u201d he told the bereaved families . \u201c And you have certainly not lost America , for we will stand with you for as many tomorrows as it takes . \u201d\nHenry Cisneros , his housing secretary , told the University of Virginia \u2019 s Miller Center that Clinton that day and Bush at smoldering ground zero six years later did what presidents are called to do .\n\u201c There are moments when \u2014 and I think 9/11 was that for President Bush \u2014 you realize this is not about politics and this is not about momentary victories and this is not about your own legacy , \u201d he said . \u201c It \u2019 s about the burden you \u2019 re carrying for the people . \u201d\nBush , in off-the-cuff words through a bullhorn to New York firefighters straining to hear him , bellowed : \u201c I can hear you , the rest of the world hears you , and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon. \u201d That was three days after Islamic terrorism laid waste to the World Trade Center and a chunk of the Pentagon .\nThree days after that , Bush visited a mosque to make common cause with American Muslims facing hate on the streets because of the extremists from abroad . \u201c Islam is peace , \u201d he said . \u201c Women who cover their heads in this country must feel comfortable going outside their homes .
