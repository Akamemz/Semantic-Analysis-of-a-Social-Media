It 's very close , and there is a real possibility they could decide the election . With Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson , the onetime Republican governor of New Mexico , at nearly 10 percent and pulling more people who say Clinton is their second choice , Donald Trump may be the beneficiary in the all-important battleground states .\nAfter watching Johnson and his running mate Bill Weld , the former Republican governor of Massachusetts , in Wednesday night 's town-hall meeting with Chris Matthews , I think maybe they should let Johnson in the debates so more of these voters could see exactly what they 're voting for .

'' was `` What is Aleppo ? '' He did n't recognize it as the name of the second-largest city in Syria , which has been in the headlines for months as a battleground where the government is fighting rebel forces . On Wednesday , Johnson said he took responsibility for his Aleppo gaffe , but further explained that he does n't believe that just because `` a politician can dot the I 's and cross the T 's on some geographic location or the name of some foreign dictator , now we should believe them when it comes to these interventions .
