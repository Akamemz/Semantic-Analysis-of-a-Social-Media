    "content": "An expansive network of \u201c shadowy \u201d dark money donors has grown to rival the influence of the conservative Koch network -- pumping millions into left-wing causes ranging from health care to climate change to abortion -- all while flying well under the radar of public scrutiny , according to an explosive new report obtained by Fox News .\nThe report , by conservative watchdog Capital Research Center , describes a band of nonprofits operating under the banner of Washington-based philanthropy company Arabella Advisors . Those \u201c pop up groups \u201d are housed in four Arabella-controlled \u201c sister \u201d nonprofits , according to the report : the New Venture Fund , Sixteen Thirty Fund , Hopewell Fund and Windward Fund .\nEX-CLINTON OFFICIAL LEADS 'DARK MONEY ' EFFORT TO BOOT KAVANAUGH FROM TEACHING GIG\n\u201c Together , these groups form an interlocking network of 'dark money ' pop-up groups and other fiscally sponsored projects , all afloat in a half-billion-dollar ocean of cash , \u201d the report says . \u201c The real puppeteer , though , is Arabella Advisors , which has managed to largely conceal its role in coordinating so much of the professional Left \u2019 s infrastructure under a mask of \u2018 philanthropy . \u2019 \u201d\nThe report says the `` hydra-like '' network brought in $ 1.6 billion between 2013 and 2017 `` to advance the political policies desired by wealthy left-wing interests , '' as the network \u2019 s revenues grew by 392 percent . The four Arabella-controlled \u201c sister \u201d groups brought in $ 582 million in 2017 alone , according to the report . If the four groups were a single entity , it would make them the 22nd largest public charity in America , with higher revenues than the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) , Planned Parenthood or the Clinton Foundation .\n\u201c The size and scope of the Arabella network of funds demonstrates far more \u2018 dark money \u2019 exists on the left side of the political spectrum than has been previously admitted , \u201d the report says .\nArabella \u2019 s website says the company was founded to \u201c provide strategic guidance for effective philanthropy \u201d and is \u201c dedicated to helping clients make a difference on the issues that matter most to them , from climate to women and girls , education , good food , and more. \u201d All told , the company represents clients with collective assets totaling more than $ 100 billion .\nBut the report alleges the group blurs the line between philanthropy and political advocacy on issues such as ObamaCare , gun control , abortion and opposition to the confirmation of now-Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh . And it says that due to the financial arrangements and lack of donor disclosure , \u201c it is impossible to know which organization subsidizes the various campaigns and political movements spawned by Arabella \u2019 s funds . \u201d\nThe company was founded by Eric Kessler , who has worked both in the Clinton administration , where he managed conservation issues , and as a member of the Clinton Global Initiative . He also founded the New Venture Fund and is on the board of the Sixteen Thirty Fund .\nArabella did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News . New Venture Fund President Lee Bodner told Fox News in a statement : `` The New Venture Fund is proud of our work supporting charitable projects that improve peoples \u2019 lives across a wide range of issues , funded by a diverse set of donors . ''\nThe report claims the group runs a network of \u201c astroturf \u201d activities including as many as 340 \u201c pop up \u201d groups -- which the report says are often little more than websites created to give the appearance of grassroots campaigns . It cites the organization 's activities pushing back against Republican efforts to repeal and replace ObamaCare as an example of its political activism .\n\u201c At a glance , these groups -- such as Save My Care and Protect Our Care -- appeared to be impassioned examples of citizen activists defending ObamaCare , \u201d the report says . \u201c In reality , neither \u2018 not-for-profit \u2019 advocacy group appears to have paid staff , held board meetings , or even owned so much as a pen . \u201d\nConsequently , the report says , the groups can be used to run \u201c short-term , high intensity media campaigns targeting the news cycle \u201d such as during the Kavanaugh confirmation hearing . The report gave the example of activists , led by Demand Justice , waving glossy \u201c Stop Kavanaugh \u201d signs in protest of the conservative nominee 's confirmation .\nDemand Justice , led by former Hillary Clinton press secretary Brian Fallon , is very active on judicial issues -- and is more than just a website . But the report described the organization as part of the broader network , specifically \u201c a front for the Sixteen Thirty Fund . \u201d\nThe Sixteen Thirty Fund , according to a July 2018 Politico report , was described as \u201c among the most prolific political advertisers of 2018 \u201d and aired 6,885 broadcast TV ads between January and July while spending $ 4.6 million on TV alone . Politico cited the group as an example of the left embracing the \u201c dark money \u201d tactics it long accused the right of weaponizing .\nLIBERAL 'DARK MONEY ' GROUPS OUTSPENT CONSERVATIVE ONES IN 2018 ELECTIONS\nPolitico identified 12 groups set up through the Sixteen Thirty Fund on health care alone . By serving as those groups \u2019 \u201c fiscal sponsor , \u201d Sixteen Thirty Fund manages the money and aggregates their financial activities in its tax filings -- making it hard to work out how much money was spent by the different groups and where .\nThe new report says liberal mega-donor George Soros ' Democracy Alliance , for instance , used the Sixteen Thirty Fund and New Venture Fund to host several projects `` that did n't disclose their original funders . '' The Capital Research Center report says that Arabella \u2019 s nonprofit network allows it to mask the \u201c pop up \u201d groups \u2019 nature , making them seem like the work of \u201c grassroots \u201d activists rather than what it calls \u201c front groups for multi-million-dollar non-profits . \u201d\nConservatives , however , are still spending more `` dark money '' than liberals in some areas . Vice , citing a study by the Brennan Center for Justice , reported last year that groups supporting Kavanaugh 's confirmation spent at least $ 7.3 million on TV ads , while those opposing him spent at least $ 2.9 million .\nDemocrats and left-wing activists -- including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , D-N.Y. -- have been increasingly vocal in their calls to clamp down and regulate \u201c dark money \u201d in U.S. political activities .\nA January report from Issue One , a bipartisan advocacy group , shows that liberal groups spent over half of the $ 150 million of dark money in the latest election . Conservative groups spent a third of the figure , while nonpartisan groups spent just 15 percent .\nAnd Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse , D-R.I. , recently said that dark money is a problem `` on both sides of the aisle , '' though he said it `` occurs mostly on the Republican side . ''\nThe Capital Research Center report warns : \u201c Before left-of-center activists and politicians demand laws to increase transparency in the funding of campaigns and public policy advocacy , they may first wish to consider voluntarily disclosing their own funding sources . \u201d",
