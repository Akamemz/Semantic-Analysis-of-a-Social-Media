We come to ponder a terrible force unleashed in the not so distant past . We come to mourn the dead , \u201d he said .\n\u201c Their souls speak to us , they ask us to look inward , take stock of who we are . \u201d\nIn a touching moment , Obama embraced Shigeaki Mori , a 79-year-old survivor who appeared overcome with emotion .\n\u201c The president gestured as if he was going to give me a hug , so we hugged , \u201d said Mori , who spent decades tracing the families of 12 American POWs who died in the attack and ensured their deaths were officially recognised .\nObama also chatted to Sunao Tsuboi , the 91-year-old head of a survivors group , who thanked the president for his visit , but reminded him of his responsibility to act on his desire , first made in Prague in 2009 , to bring about a world without nuclear weapons .\nObama urged the world to \u201c choose a future when Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not considered the dawn of atomic warfare but as the start of our own moral awakening . \u201d\nHe said : \u201c Technological progress without equivalent progress in human institutions can doom us . The scientific revolution that led to the splitting of the atom requires a moral revolution as well .\n\u201c This is why we come to this place , we stand here , in the middle of this city and force ourselves to imagine the moment the bomb fell .\n\u201c We force ourselves to feel the dread of children confused by what they see . We listen to a silent cry .\nHiroshima and the nuclear age \u2013 a visual guide Read more\n\u201c Some day , the voices will no longer be with us to bear witness , but the memory must never fade . That memory fuels our imagination . It allows us to change . \u201d\nHis address included mention of the tens of thousands of Koreans \u2013 many of them forced labourers \u2013 who died in the attack , as well as the American dead .\nIn the distance stood the burned-out shell of the Atomic Bomb Dome \u2013 a peace memorial that is the most potent physical symbol of Hiroshima \u2019 s tragic past and its recovery from the ashes of war .\nAs expected , Obama did not offer an apology for the decision by his predecessor , Harry Truman , to unleash an atomic bomb over the city . The attack at the end of the second world war on 6 August 1945 killed an estimated 80,000 people soon after the blast . By the end of the year , the death toll had reached 140,000 .\nObama and Tsuboi laughed at one point , the president smiling broadly . But mostly he listened , holding the elderly man \u2019 s hand in his own , an interpreter standing nearby . Tsuboi stamped his cane emphatically while speaking .\nObama was accompanied by the Japanese prime minister , Shinz\u014d Abe , whose presence , Obama said ahead of the visit , would \u201c highlight the extraordinary alliance \u201d the US had created during the seven decades since the end of the war .\nAfter looking at some of the exhibits in the peace museum , Obama wrote in the visitors \u2019 book : \u201c We have known the agony of war . Let us now find the courage , together , to spread peace , and pursue a world without nuclear weapons \u201d \u2013 a goal he conceded he may not see in his lifetime .\nAbe described Obama \u2019 s visit as \u201c courageous \u201d , saying : \u201c An American president has come into contact with the reality of an atomic bombing and renewed his resolve toward realising a world without nuclear weapons .\n\u201c I sincerely welcome this historic visit , which has long been awaited by not only the people of Hiroshima , but by all Japanese people . \u201d\nKaneko Izumi , a Hiroshima resident who was among the hundreds of people who filled the peace park in the evening to pay their respects to the victims , said Obama \u2019 s speech had offered hope to ageing survivors \u201c who have been waiting most of their lives for an American president to come here \u201d .\nNot all residents were satisfied with the president \u2019 s speech , however . \u201c I \u2019 m afraid I did not hear anything concrete about how he plans to achieve the abolition of nuclear weapons , \u201d said Miki Tsukishita , who was five years old when the bomb was dropped . \u201c Just cheering his visit is not enough .
