It could add up to a powerful threat to the Obama administration \u2019 s $ 30 billion program to digitize the nation \u2019 s medical records .\nMany doctors hate the clunky , time-sucking software they got through the massive subsidy program , and most complain that cumbersome information exchange is frustrating their efforts to coordinate and improve patient care . A quarter-million \u2014 half of those eligible for the electronic health records program \u2014 will face fines in 2015 for failing to use the systems in the way the government required .\nState Medicaid officials don \u2019 t know how many of their doctors are using electronic records , although they have handed out $ 9 billion of those federal funds to encourage their adoption . Nor do they have much sense of how much the technology is helping low-income patients .\nAll in all , while many believe digital health will eventually bring huge benefits , physicians have seen few of them to date .\nNow , as the government begins cutting payments to those who have failed to demonstrate \u201c meaningful use \u201d of the electronic health records Washington began subsidizing four years ago , physician groups are fighting mad . And Congress wants to know why an industry with three freshly minted billionaires isn \u2019 t making better software .\n2015 promises to be a critical year for determining whether electronic health records will enable physicians to communicate with each other efficiently to create better care . If they can \u2019 t get their systems to interact , the program may be seen as largely a waste .\nSince 2011 , U.S. doctors and hospitals have had to show they were using electronic records to do things like prescribing and ordering tests , getting patients to download information , and to prove they were asking patients questions about things like smoking and blood pressure control .\nWhen the subsidy program was announced as part of the federal stimulus , 12 percent of doctors had computerized records . Now , 60 percent of doctors and nearly all hospitals do . That \u2019 s a major commitment , and no one wants to go back to paper . But it \u2019 s a two-edged sword .\nThose who see Medicare patients can earn up to $ 43,720 in federal payments for demonstrating \u201c meaningful use \u201d of their computers , but eventually they face penalties of as much as 5 percent of their Medicare payments for failing to meet the program \u2019 s requirements .\nThe first year of penalties starts in January ; more than 250,000 doctors will have 1 percent of their Medicare payments docked .\nMembers of Congress who track health IT are convinced the program is on the wrong track , according to House Energy and Commerce Committee staff . They aren \u2019 t entirely sure how to fix it , but 30 House members , including two Democrats , have co-sponsored a bill that would keep more doctors from being penalized by Medicare .\nThe fines are a bitter pill for doctors , who are spending an average of nearly an extra hour a day typing information into their computers because of the new rules . That means lost time with patients , and less income .\nRather than saving physicians and health care money , the program in effect has created a new industry \u2014 the medical scribe . About 100,000 of these glorified typists are expected to be working for doctors by 2020 .\n\u201c After five years I can \u2019 t really do anything I couldn \u2019 t do before the program started , \u201d says Martin O \u2019 Hara , a cardiologist who practices in northern Virginia . Computers make everything more legible , O \u2019 Hara says , but otherwise the payoff has been slim .\nAt one hospital in the D.C. area , administrators were pulling their hair out over the huge fees charged to transmit data including routine lab and radiology tests . \u201c I talk to EHR vendors all day long and many of them have these criminal-like practices of setting whatever price tag they want because they can , \u201d said a medical informatics officer who spoke on condition he not be named .\nRecently an EHR vendor charged the hospital $ 50,000 just to pull information from the computers of 20 affiliated physician practices and send it to the Department of Health and Human Services . The hospital had no choice but to pay , because HHS would withhold certain Medicare payments without the data .\nEHR vendors promise they are working to improve the flow of data between medical offices and hospitals . But these blocked exchanges have attracted the attention of the Federal Trade Commission , and Congress put language in the spending bill President Barack Obama signed Dec. 16 that requires HHS \u2019 Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT to investigate why records aren \u2019 t flowing smoothly \u2014 and to decertify software that blocks such transactions .\nFree data flows were a prime objective of the federal health IT push . The idea was that computers would make it easy for , say , a doctor to learn that his diabetic patient had been hospitalized . He could make sure she went home with the right drugs and a home nurse , so she didn \u2019 t end up back in an ER a week later after falling during a blood sugar-related bout of dizziness . And if she had other specialists , perhaps affiliated with different hospitals , they could follow her progress and communicate with each other too .\nThe idea is to both help the individual patient have better coordinated care , and to save the health care system money . If the records of 10,000 such diabetics flowed into databases used by researchers , went the thinking , they could more easily figure out the best drugs and treatments and make health care safer , cheaper and more effective .\nThe slow progress of health IT has also put a drag on research .

It \u2019 s not easy to obtain a record that makes sense to either the patient or a researcher , Kean said .\nOptimists think an $ 11 billion contract to rewire the military \u2019 s electronic health records system could give software vendors the kick in the pants needed to get the country \u2019 s systems talking to each other .\nThe military , which wants the medical records of its active-duty soldiers to move smoothly to the Department of Veterans Affairs when they retire , has said it will pay only for a computer system that openly talks with others .\nThe major health IT giants , including Epic and Cerner , both run by Fortune 400 billionaires , have been vying for the contract by talking up their ability to exchange information .\nEpic , a privately held company that holds the medical records of about half of Americans , has often been accused of failing to provide cheap or easy ways to connect with doctors or hospitals that don \u2019 t use its software .
