Warren, though, denies any interest in the presidency and continued to do that Monday in an interview with Jeremy Hobson on NPR's Here & Now.\n\n\"I'm out here fighting this fight,\" Warren said. \"I'm fighting it every single day in the United States.\"\n\nAsked if she wants to run, Warren said bluntly, \"I do not.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean Warren won't have an impact on 2016 or Hillary Clinton, the current front-runner for the Democratic nomination.\n\n\"What I care about is that everyone who runs for president, who runs for any national office right now, talks about this core set of issues about what kind of a country we are and what kind of a future we're building.

The biggest financial institutions loaded up on risk and they did it in two ways. They sold mortgages to people all across this country that were designed to explode and ... they knew it at the time they were selling it. ... Each little mortgage, it was almost like [financial institutions] selling grenades with the pins pulled out and then putting them in big packages and selling boxes of grenades with the pins pulled out. ...

They're about a third bigger now than when they ...\n\nWhy is that?\n\nMoney talks. Never forget that. Especially in Washington, boy is that the message. The biggest financial institutions, remember what they did? First they load up on risk and they manage to get their regulators to look the other way, they crash the economy, they get a bailout from the American taxpayer and then they turn around and instead of saying, \"We're sorry; we did this the wrong way,\" instead they started spending more than $1 million a day, lobbying against financial reforms, trying to weaken them as much as possible.\n\nOn interest in running for president\n\nI'm working on those ideas, I'm pushing those ideas forward, I'm fighting for those ideas, every single day.\n\nBut you don't want to run, still?\n\nI do not.\n\nDo you think it will be better for the party though if Hillary Clinton has a challenger in the primary?\n\nNow, come on. Hillary Clinton has not declared.\n\nDo you think it would be better if she sails through the nomination or if she has a challenger from the left?\n\nWhat I care about is that everyone who runs for president, who runs for any national office right now, talks about this core set of issues about what kind of a country we are and what kind of a future we're building. For me this is really personal.\n\nInterested in being Democratic leader in the Senate?\n\nNope.\n\nNot interested?\n\nNope.\n\nOn Chuck Schumer\n\nI think it's pretty clear that Chuck is going to be a leader ... and I talk about this in my book that Chuck was one of the first people to support the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and to get out there and fight for it. I remember the very first press conference that he helped put together where we brought this idea up and then got out there and started fighting for it. He's been there on the front lines.\n\nHe's not too close to Wall Street?\n\nLook, I worry about everyone being too close to Wall Street, let's be clear.
