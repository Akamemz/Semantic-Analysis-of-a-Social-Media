'' Making a charge of that magnitude based on two unnamed sources , without being able to cite a single e-mail , text or document , is very risky business .

Unfortunately , this was amplified by the media echo chamber .\nBut interviews and hours of earlier video made clear the story was more complicated . The students were shouting `` school spirit '' chants ( with the approval of their chaperones ) to drown out racially charged chants by a third group of black protestors , the Hebrew Israelites .\nSandmann , rather than inciting the confrontation , was actually approached by Phillips , who says he was being peaceful but whose story has been shifting .
