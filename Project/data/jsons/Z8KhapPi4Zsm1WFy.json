Here are his full remarks , followed by some commentary :\nRubio 's favorability ratings as good as Walker , Bush 's among GOPers . But he 's often a 2nd choice . Will that change ? http : //t.co/UVYGK8r5IL \u2014 Nate Silver ( @ NateSilver538 ) April 13 , 2015\nThe more I think about it , the more I think his biggest asset is that he \u2019 s the safest pick among the top tier of candidate \u2014 by far . No one knows if Jeb can shed his \u201c Bush baggage. \u201d No one knows if Walker can attain the sort of fluency Rubio already has on foreign policy , or if his ham-handed early pandering on immigration will lead to other opportunistic policy reversals . No one knows if Rand Paul can prevent Democrats from painting him as a crank , and no one knows how many Republican hawks will stay home in protest if he \u2019 s the nominee . No one knows if Ted Cruz can appeal to swing voters in a national election , even if he figures out a path to the GOP nomination . Rubio , though , seems like a low-risk choice on almost every front . He banked some centrist cred with his immigration bill and his new tax-reform plan ; he \u2019 s got his own trailblazing racial narrative ; he can ( probably ) deliver a major swing state ; he \u2019 ll be excellent on the stump , and far , far , far better than Hillary Clinton . There won \u2019 t be any major gaffes a la Romney and the 47 percent , there won \u2019 t be any weird stunts like McCain suspending his campaign over the financial crisis . He \u2019 ll be solid . Even his most obvious liability , his youth , could turn out to be an asset against Clinton , a candidate nearly 25 years older ... The fear with electing a young president is that he doesn \u2019 t know the issues ; Rubio palpably does and will have many chances to prove it . Besides , how can Hillary attack him for his age ? Rubio will be 45 on election day 2016 . Bill Clinton \u2019 s age when he was elected to his first term : 46 .\nWhy does generational contrast matter ? 5 of the last six prez elections won by younger nominee . Bush/Gore the exception . \u2014 Chuck Todd ( @ chucktodd ) April 13 , 2015\nOne gets the sense that Rubio does n't think the stuff about American exceptionalism + American Dream is just BOMFOG speech boilerplate \u2014 James Pethokoukis ( @ JimPethokoukis ) April 13 , 2015\nAs Dan noted last night , Rubio directly criticized the Obama administration on foreign policy , and dismissed Hillary Clinton as a relic of yesterday 's politics . His campaign theme is the forward-looking mission of securing a 'new American century , ' rooted in an abiding appreciation for the genius of our founding , and deep love of what America has meant to her people and to the world . Sounding very much like 2008 's Barack Obama , Rubio positioned himself as representing a needed break from the past , and described 2016 's dynamic as a change election . Sounding very much unlike Barack Obama , Rubio attacked expansionist government and demanded the United States reassert its imperative role as the leader of the free world . His speech was optimistic and future-oriented , previewing exactly how he 'd frame a head-to-head contest with the presumptive Democratic nominee . I suspect he senses a real opportunity at the prospect of Hillary Clinton effectively running as an older continuation of the Obama presidency . Rubio enters the fray with single-digit support , but data guru Nate Silver makes an interesting observation : Rubio is in pretty good shape in terms of favorability , but he has n't galvanized much support as a top-tier candidate -- at least not yet . He 's an acceptable fallback for quite a lot of Republicans , but he 's not at the top of many voters ' list . Not a terrible spot to occupy at this early stage , sure , but one from which he 'll need to emerge to attract dollars and attention . Silver 's question is a good one . Here 's another , via Allahpundi t -- is Rubio actually the safest option for national Republicans ? Meet the Press host Chuck Todd adds additional perspective to the youth question : As AP says , Rubio 's fluency on issues and strength as a compelling , extemporaneous speaker will serve him well over the day-in , day-out grind of a presidential campaign . Yes , he tends to lean heavily on moving anecdotes about his family in speeches , but beneath the inspirational rhetoric is a deep pool of knowledg e , much of it quite detailed .

Remember , regardless of how things play out , he 'll be out of a job as a US Senator come 2017 . And even though his favorables are in good shape among core Republican voters at the moment , can those numbers withstand a barrage of attack ads over the 'Gang of Eight ' immigration bill he co-sponsored ?
