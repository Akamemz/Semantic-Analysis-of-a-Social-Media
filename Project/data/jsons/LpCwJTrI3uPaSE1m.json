This professor ( identified as Joseph Mifsud by the Washington Post ) told Papadopoulos that the Russians had \u201c dirt \u201d on Clinton , that \u201c the Russians had emails of Clinton , \u201d and that \u201c they have thousands of emails . \u201d\nThis charging document then goes on to describe , at length , Papadopoulos \u2019 s contacts with other campaign officials as he labored unsuccessfully to try to set up a trip to Russia for the candidate .\nBut aside from this mention , the document remains conspicuously silent about the obvious question of whether Papadopoulos told other Trump campaign advisers what he had heard about that Clinton email \u201c dirt . \u201d\nThat \u2019 s an enormously important question \u2014 and the answer to it could be crucial to the investigation .\nCould it all , in the end , come back to emails ?\nQuestions about Trump , Russia , and the 2016 campaign are often framed in terms of whether there was \u201c collusion. \u201d But in addition to not actually being a legal term , collusion is also a rather vague term .\nSome people , for instance , argued that the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. , Manafort , and a Russian lawyer in July was proof of collusion .
