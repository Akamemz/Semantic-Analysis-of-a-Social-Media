    "content": "While Donald Trump dines on frog legs with Mitt Romney and meets with a parade of lawmakers and governors in his gold-plated Midtown skyscraper , most of his transition staff are hunkered down in Washington , D.C. , writing detailed governing plans for his first 100 days .\nBut so far , Trump and his inner circle have largely ignored those plans as they focus on top appointments and lean on the advice of politicians , CEOs and donors , rather than on their transition staff , say sources close to the transition .\nThe president-elect , meanwhile , has been more likely to set policy on Twitter than through consultation with his D.C. advisers .\n\u201c The senior people are all focused on Cabinet appointments , \u201d said a Republican official involved in past transitions . \u201c I wonder how much time , attention and decision-making is being allocated to the rest of the government . \u2026 It is not a recipe for smooth governance . ''\nThe New York-D.C. transition divide reflects Trump \u2019 s tendency to focus on personnel and , especially , personality , over policy . Experts say that bent , combined with his improvisational style and the divisions between the teams will complicate his transition to the White House , making it less likely he \u2019 ll have a cohesive roadmap for governing on Day One .\nLisa Brown , a former top official for the Obama-Biden transition , warns that failing to engage on policy could hamper his administration 's governing efforts .\n\u201c It is hard to get the government to do things . It \u2019 s not like you flip a switch , \u201d she said . \u201c Even reversing regulations , as Trump has said he wants to do , is a long process . \u201d\nIndeed , some Obama administration officials worry the Trump transition is far behind in coming up with department-by-department transition plans . EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy , for example , told reporters on Monday that her agency has had only one visit from one person from the transition team .\nA Trump transition official disputed any divide between New York and D.C. , or that the transition is falling behind , saying the senior team is \u201c providing clear guidance for New York and D.C. every single day . \u2026 The operations are seamless and working well . \u201d\nTo be sure , past transitions have also suffered from geographic divides . Barack Obama spent much of his time in Chicago ahead of his inauguration and Hillary Clinton \u2019 s close aides were also largely based in New York City . The influence of lower-level transition policy staff has always paled in comparison to those aides who have the president-elect \u2019 s ear .\n\u201c Any transition team only has the power to make recommendations , unless someone on that team ends up in the government , \u201d says Charlie Black , a long-time GOP operative and lobbyist , who is not working for the Trump transition .\nBut former transition officials say Trump \u2019 s operation is unusual in the way it \u2019 s leaving so much of the policy and second-tier personnel appointments to D.C. transition team members , many of whom are volunteers with little power and no connection to Trump \u2019 s key advisers .\nOn the Obama transition team , for instance , John Podesta ran interference between the president-elect and the massive D.C. transition operation and kept a tight rein over it . While Vice President-elect Mike Pence is technically doing this job , he \u2019 s also the governor of Indiana and vice president-elect , responsible for advising on Cabinet picks and reaching out to Capitol Hill .\n\u201c Personnel is so important in this administration because they don \u2019 t have a clear roadmap for policy , \u201d said a Republican official involved in past transitions . \u201c Whoever they pick at Education or as the domestic policy chief will be writing a lot of it . \u201d\nThat official noted that if they had , say , a well-defined tax plan , parts of it would already have been shared with the Joint Tax Committee or Congressional Budget Office to see how much revenue would really be lost . \u201c For this gang , I don \u2019 t think this stuff matters very much , \u201d he said .\nPeople close to Trump say they expect him to rely heavily on Pence and other policy staffers once he enters the White House , freeing up Trump to stake out a broader strategic and political vision .\n`` I don \u2019 t necessarily think he \u2019 s saying , 'Boy , I \u2019 d really like to breathlessly wait for the Ways and Means subcommittee to put out the first draft of the tax reform bill , \u2019 '' said one person close to Trump 's transition team .\nTrump has few real ties to Washington \u2019 s network of Republican policy wonks and is much more likely to take advice from son-in-law Jared Kushner and Steve Bannon , Trump \u2019 s incoming chief strategist , than from veterans of Republican presidencies .\n\u201c There is an expectation that Trump will adjust to Washington , but I keep telling people that Washington needs to adjust to him , \u201d says a lobbyist close to the transition . \u201c There is less influence from Washington than there is from the orbits directly around him . \u201d\nStill , it is the D.C. transition staff that will build the bridge between the Obama and Trump administrations . It is assembling the all-important \u201c beachhead \u201d teams that will enter federal agencies on Jan. 20 and run things for several months if need be while Trump \u2019 s nominees are awaiting Senate confirmation . The teams will consist of appointees who don \u2019 t require confirmation , like chiefs of staff , who will work with existing career employees to ensure a seamless transition , two people familiar with Trump \u2019 s transition told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nRight now , though , the only access the D.C. staff has to Trump \u2019 s inner circle is through Pence and his top aides , creating a \u201c bottleneck \u201d of information , says one lobbyist with transition ties . \u201c Everyone is inundating him and his people with their content .

Recently , the transition team has added a new layer of top advisers \u2014 more than a dozen business executives \u2014 putting even greater distance between the president-elect \u2019 s top advisers and the people making the majority of the policy suggestions .\n\u201c The executive team is doing high-profile vetting , recommendations and recruitment , \u201d said Rep.

It is not the glamorous end of the stick , \u201d a GOP strategist added .\nTransition staff in D.C. , many of whom are well-respected in their fields and have direct experience working in federal agencies , have been told not to expect jobs in the Trump administration .
