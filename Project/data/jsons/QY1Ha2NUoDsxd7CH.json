    "content": "ATLANTA \u2014 One day before the Democratic Party chose its new leader , supporters of Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison found themselves suddenly parrying an attack they thought they \u2019 d already defeated : that Ellison had a troubling record of opposing Israel and American Jews .\nOn Friday , a group called the American Jewish Congress told members of the Democratic National Committee that Ellison \u2014 the first Muslim member of Congress \u2014 would `` threaten the relationship '' between America and Israel . Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz published an op-ed saying an Ellison victory would force him out of the Democratic Party , citing Ellison \u2019 s allegedly \u201c sordid association with anti-Semitism. \u201d A letter sent to DNC members said Ellison had a history of \u201c unfairly demonizing \u201d Israel \u2019 s treatment of the Palestinians , according to emails shared with \u2588\u2588\u2588 and first reported by the Young Turks ' Nomiki Konst .\nEllison \u2019 s team rushed to counter with email blasts from its most prominent Jewish supporters \u2014 one from American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten , another that night from Minnesota Rep. Frank Hornstein , and then a third the next morning from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer :\nChuck Schumer issues a statement in support of Ellison , including affirmation of Israel bona fides pic.twitter.com/mQt8RYUQ0m \u2014 Daniel Marans ( @ danielmarans ) February 24 , 2017\nOn Saturday , former Obama Labor Secretary Tom Perez won the DNC chair race by a narrow 235-200 margin . There \u2019 s zero evidence Perez did anything to encourage the last-minute attacks against Ellison \u2019 s record . But in about a dozen interviews , Ellison supporters both inside and outside the DNC said they believed the \u201c anti-Israel \u201d charge helped derail Ellison \u2019 s bid \u2014 either directly by scaring DNC voting members away from Ellison or by indirectly by knocking his team off their message and pitch .\n\u201c In the final 36 hours , the Ellison campaign spent significant resources combating an 11th-hour smear campaign that was sending targeted emails to Jewish DNC members , \u201d texted an official on the Ellison campaign , speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss internal campaign matters .\nAdded Melahat Rafiei , a DNC voting member from California who supported Ellison : \u201c Probably the most heartbreaking part of this process was seeing the fruition of Islamophobia in our own party . It was Islamophobia , to the fullest extent possible , and it was disappointing [ that Democrats ] were influenced by it . \u201d\nDNC members who voted for Perez \u2014 as well as some who backed Ellison \u2014 vehemently reject this characterization of their thinking . They say their candidate won fair and square \u2014 by being a better candidate who had more experience and offered a bolder vision for the party , and not because the DNC voting members were persuaded by a spurious attack .\nPerez supporters : we didn \u2019 t win because of the Ellison smear campaign\nMissouri Democrat Brian Wahby sounds taken aback by even the suggestion that DNC members went with Perez because they disapproved of Ellison \u2019 s record on either American Jews or Israel .\n\u201c That has nothing to do with it . Nobody said anything to me about that , \u201d said Wahby , who voted for Perez , adding that he is himself Lebanese . \u201c Honestly : Nobody said anything to me in any of the deliberations one way or another regarding Israel . \u201d\nThe refrain was echoed by every DNC delegate who voted for Perez and spoke with \u2588\u2588\u2588 . Those delegates said that neither they nor anybody they knew let attacks on Ellison \u2019 s record on Israel sway their vote .\n\u201c That never entered into my thinking in any way , shape , or form , \u201d said Nancy Monacelli , a Washington state DNC voting member . \u201c I got emails from Jewish organizations that were concerned , but I thought Keith addressed it fine . Certainly no one I spoke to had any hangups about that . \u201d\nAdded Iris Martinez , a DNC voter from Illinois who backed Perez : \u201c No , no , no \u2014 there \u2019 s a lot of stuff people put out there [ on the internet ] . But I didn \u2019 t see it . \u201d\nA few Ellison supporters , including Rafiei , alleged that Perez did not do enough to publicly condemn the swirling charge of anti-Semitism \u2014 an accusation that drew fierce denunciations from Perez supporters . Some argued that even the suggestion represented a divisive line that amounted to little more than sour grapes about losing .\n\u201c That \u2019 s bullshit . And you can quote me on that , \u201d said Wahby . \u201c Emotions run high , and they \u2019 re running very high now \u2014 not just in the DNC but in the country . We say a lot of things we don \u2019 t really mean in an election . \u201d\nEven the pro-Perez candidates who admitted that the controversy over Ellison \u2019 s positions on Israel and past ties to the Nation of Islam gave them some pause initially said it was a non-factor . \u201c I do not think that was an issue after Keith responded . Earlier on , before he responded , it was , \u201d said Jim Roosevelt , a DNC voting member from Massachusetts . \u201c I did not hear it on people \u2019 s minds today . \u201d\n\u201c People were voting for a person who is going to go back and rebuild the party and do grassroots organizing and take on Donald Trump , \u201d said Rick Wade , a DNC member from South Carolina who supported Perez . Wade added he hadn \u2019 t received any emails about Ellison and Israel : \u201c I haven \u2019 t heard of that . \u201d\nAnd it \u2019 s worth noting that even some pro-Ellison DNC members were also dismissive of the idea that the accusations of anti-Semitism flung at Ellison actually led anyone to vote for Perez instead . \u201c Obviously , the vote was very close ... but whether it affected any Jewish members of the DNC ? To me , I don \u2019 t think it did , \u201d said Cliff Mooney , a North Carolina Democrat and voting member who supported Ellison . \u201c The only things I heard today had nothing to do with that . \u201d\nOn their way out of the Atlanta hotel , after more than five hours of debates and votes and arguing , two nurses wearing bright red scrubs and Ellison pins stopped in front of a reporter and lamented that a \u201c smear \u201d campaign helped hand Perez the victory .\n\u201c Oh , absolutely it hurt him \u2014 it \u2019 s what they used against him , \u201d said Jean Ross , of National Nurses United , when asked about the accusations that Ellison was anti-Israel or anti-Semitic . \u201c Certainly , many states \u2019 [ DNC ] voters heard rumors about him being anti-Semitic , even though he was solidly endorsed by the Jewish community . \u201d\nStanding to her right was Martese Chism , a nurse from Chicago who was in Atlanta to back Ellison . She added of the Democrats : \u201c They claim they 're an inclusive party , but then they drop a Muslim and everyone backs off . \u201d\nRoss and Chism singled out CNN \u2019 s coverage for blame . In early December 2016 , CNN \u2019 s Andrew Kaczynski published a story examining Ellison \u2019 s youthful support for black radical leaders like Kwame Ture and Louis Farrakhan . Members of the Nation of Islam , Ture and Farrakhan have expressed anti-Semitic views . But in 2006 , Ellison apologized for not doing more to directly call out their anti-Semitic views \u2014 and there \u2019 s no evidence he ever praised any anti-Semitic comments .\nDuring the campaign , another complaint emerged against Ellison stemming from comments he made at a private meeting about American foreign policy toward Israel . J.J. Goldberg , of the Jewish newspaper the Forward , argued that they had been ripped out of context . It \u2019 d be hard to call Ellison \u201c anti-Israel \u201d without also branding the left flank of the Democratic Party , several Jewish advocacy groups , and a faction of Israel \u2019 s domestic politicians with the same label . ( Here \u2019 s a more detailed look at the charges from December 2016 . )\nNonetheless , both stories got wide traction in the mainstream and right-wing media \u2014 and among some in the Democratic Party . Haim Saban , who donated $ 8 million to Hillary Clinton \u2019 s Super PAC and is one of the party \u2019 s largest donors , ripped Ellison as both \u201c anti-Israel \u201d and anti-Semitic , according to the Intercept . And the story became a major plot in the race for the DNC , brought up at primetime debates as vulnerabilities for Ellison .\nWhy Ellison supporters feel burned by accusations of anti-Israel sentiment\nThis criticism of Ellison \u2019 s record on Israel and with the Nation of Islam culminated in concern beyond the media and donor circles , extending to Jewish Democratic voters \u2014 who in turn lobbied their representatives in the party .\nEric Bauman is the vice chair of the California Democratic Party , and was a pro-Ellison advocate . A self-described \u201c observant , pro-Israel Jew , \u201d Bauman said he spent much of his time over the past six weeks responding to questions from constituents worried about Ellison \u2019 s history on Israel .\n\u201c I 've received emails ranging from people simply asking me , 'How can you support Ellison when he 's anti-Israel ? ' to people sending me hateful emails like , 'How could you support an anti-Semite who believes in the destruction of Israel ? \u201d Bauman says , adding that the charges are preposterous .\n`` I can tell you for sure there were people in the party who oppose him because they believe Jewish supporters or Jewish donors would be so repelled that they 'd walk away from the party . But it 's a small number \u2014 it 's not a large number . ''\nSeveral DNC members backing Ellison said they had conversations with undecided voting members who were tied up over his history on Israel . ( No DNC member interviewed for this story would confirm the charge . ) \u201c I know people who were on the fence only because of this specific reason , \u201d said Mike Kapp , a voting member of the DNC from California .\nIt \u2019 s possible , Kapp said , that all the people wavering because of this issue supported Ellison anyway . ( We don \u2019 t know which DNC members supported which chair candidate , since the ballots from the race haven \u2019 t been released . ) But even if that were the case , Kapp said that having to rebut the charges zapped Ellison \u2019 s team of time and resources for other vital campaigning .\n\u201c If it wasn \u2019 t for that , we would \u2019 ve had at least a couple more votes on our side that we wouldn \u2019 t have had to spend time and resources trying to convince , \u201d Kapp says .\nAndrew Lachman , a DNC member from California , also conceded that the pro-Perez faction may not have consciously voted a certain way because of the Ellison/Israel controversy . But he noted that the attacks may have still hurt Ellison by fueling the perception that he was a risky , far-left choice .\n\u201c Some people expressed a concern that Ellison was coming from the more progressive wing of the party and would make it difficult to expand the tent \u2014 those statements [ on Israel and Jews ] were brought up as examples , \u201d Lachman said . \u201c If any politician has made statements that have raised controversy in the past , there \u2019 s always a concern they can be brought up again as a distraction . \u201d\nSandra Lowe , a DNC member from California who supported Ellison , emphasized that the \u201c smears \u201d forced the Ellison campaign to address \u201c someone else \u2019 s talking point \u201d \u2014 rather than talking up his campaign plans .\n\u201c When you lose a race , it \u2019 s usually because there \u2019 s something out there . And anything that holds people back slightly is something you have to consider , \u201d Lowe said . \u201c When you \u2019 re getting emails from constituents saying , \u2018 I \u2019 m never going to vote for you again , \u2019 it \u2019 s real . It was a factor in the race . \u201d",
