Elizabeth Warren ( D-Mass . ) , needed to demonstrate that he could offer progressives something unique\u2026 [ But ] he was the old Bernie \u2014 yelling , stern and short on details . How do we get to Medicare-for-all ? Everyone gets behind it ! His free college plan came in for a pummeling by Buttigieg , who made clear we should not subsidize college for billionaires \u2019 children . Sanders \u2019 s act wore thin as time went on .

She demonstrated just how her toughness and prosecutorial experience could be wielded \u2014 not just against Democrats but eventually against President Trump\u2026 By the end of the debate , I was left wishing for a Harris standoff with Elizabeth Warren . \u201d\n\u201c Sanders and Biden \u2013 the presumed stars of the debate \u2013 were the least impressive of the 10 candidates on the stage . Both seemed tired , rehearsed and out of touch\u2026 Biden seemed unfocused , distracted , and stuck in the past , invoking President Barack Obama \u2019 s name like Obama was a rock star who Biden met backstage once rather than the president Biden served with for eight years . Sanders came off like he was trying to right the wrong of his loss in a 2016 grudge match against Hillary Clinton .
