He also will push for more spending to fund his job-creation proposals and education plans .\n( SEE RELATED : Ted Nugent to be a guest at State of the Union address )\n\u201c He will focus on the proposals that are necessary to help the middle class grow and help the economy grow , \u201d White House press secretary Jay Carney said Monday . \u201c We need more investment that helps the key industries of the 21st century take root here in the United States .

He \u2019 s in great political shape . I don \u2019 t think he \u2019 s going to do anything serious [ on spending ] . He has every reason to sit tight and play to his base . \u201d\n( SEE RELATED : State of Union response carries risk for Marco Rubio )\nThe day after delivering his agenda , Mr. Obama will begin a series of trips to sell his initiatives to the public in North Carolina , Georgia and Illinois .\nThe danger in failing to reach out to Republicans on deficit reduction , some analysts say , is that the Republicans have the power to block Mr. Obama \u2019 s top priorities such as immigration reform . If the president takes too combative a posture with Republicans , it will \u201c doom \u201d much of his agenda , said Alice Rivlin , another senior fellow at Brookings who served on Mr. Obama \u2019 s debt commission .\n\u201c We have a long-run problem , and if he \u2019 s seen as not addressing it by much of the country and by the Republican opposition , he will doom his other agenda to bickering , \u201d she said .\nSince winning re-election handily Nov. 6 , Mr. Obama and his team have been giving every indication that they think they have the Republican Party on the run . They say their hand was strengthened when they won the \u201c fiscal cliff \u201d showdown Jan. 1 , pushing through a tax-rate increase on families earning more than $ 450,000 , and when Republican lawmakers temporarily backed away from a threat to block an increase in the nation \u2019 s borrowing limit . Many Republicans view the debt ceiling as one of their few remaining options to force Mr. Obama to address spending .\nAs the president pursues an unabashedly liberal agenda , Democrats are simultaneously trying to exploit a rift in the Republican Party , as evidenced by a memo circulated Monday by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee on gun control .\n\u201c On the eve of a major grass-roots push in favor of gun violence prevention , it \u2019 s clear that Tea Party House Republicans will maintain their out-of-touch approach and obstruct sensible reforms to reduce gun violence that most Americans support \u2014 undermining their party \u2019 s appeal , hurting their candidates and endangering suburban Republican seats , \u201d the memo states .\nMichael Franc , vice president of government studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation , said he expects Mr. Obama to lay out the broad liberal philosophy that supports his initiatives .\n\u201c The redistribution philosophy ; the sense that government spending creates wealth , not detracts from it ; the sense that the agents of government are smart enough to make a lot of decisions about our daily lives \u2014 those core instincts guide the philosophy , \u201d Mr . Franc said . \u201c One of the consequences of the president being a lame duck is that he becomes \u2018 progressive unplugged. \u2019 So we \u2019 re seeing the true Barack Obama right now , and it \u2019 s an unapologetic and very proud progressive . \u201d\nAlthough White House aides weren \u2019 t tipping the president \u2019 s hand , Democrats also are hoping that Mr. Obama expands on his inaugural address with a new push to make it easier to vote , including federal legislation mandating early voting in all 50 states . In his inaugural speech , Mr. Obama said , \u201c Our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote . \u201d\nMr. Obama will devote much of his speech to the economy , a theme he previewed for House Democrats last week .\n\u201c I \u2019 m going to be talking about making sure that we \u2019 re focused on job creation here in the United States of America , \u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201c It means that we \u2019 re focused on education and that every young person is equipped with the skills they need to compete in the 21st century . It means that we \u2019 ve got an energy agenda that can make us less dependent on foreign oil , but also that we \u2019 re cultivating the kind of clean-energy strategy that will maintain our leadership well into the future . \u201d\n\u201c We \u2019 ll talk about that stuff , \u201d Mr. Obama said , \u201c but all from the perspective of how are we making sure that somebody who works hard in this country \u2014 a cop , or a teacher , or a construction worker , or a receptionist \u2014 that they can make it if they work hard , and that their kids can make it and dream even bigger dreams than they have achieved . \u201d\nIn other words , deficit reduction will take a back seat to jobs programs and more spending . Although Mr. Carney rejected the notion Monday that the president was again \u201c pivoting \u201d back to the economy , a poll shows Americans are still deeply concerned about the lack of jobs .\nThe survey by Quinnipiac University found that 53 percent of respondents think the U.S. is still in a recession , even though economists have said the economic downturn ended in July 2009 . Given that , Mr. Obama is expected to revive long-standing proposals for more federal spending on infrastructure , manufacturing , clean energy and education .\nThe president told House Democrats that he asks himself the same question when evaluating the worthiness of administration proposals : \u201c Is this helping to make sure that everybody has got a fair shot and everybody is doing their fair share , and everybody is playing by the same rules ?\n\u201c Because I believe that is a growth agenda \u2014 not just an equity agenda , not just a fairness agenda \u2014 that is a growth agenda . That is when we have grown fastest . \u201d\nThe first State of the Union address of President Obama \u2019 s second term is shaping up as a conservative \u2019 s nightmare come true .\nIn his speech to Congress on Tuesday night , Mr. Obama is certain to demand more tax revenue , part of his \u201c balanced \u201d approach to deficit reduction , even though he already got a tax increase on wealthier households last month .
