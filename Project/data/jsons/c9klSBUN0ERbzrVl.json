But it needs to also be genuinely transformative in a way that would make it legitimately worth doing on the off-chance that Trump somehow decides to agree to it .\nHanding Trump a bipartisan legislative victory is too high a price to pay for a $ 1 trillion worth of pork barrel spending on random highway interchanges and road-widening projects , in other words , but the country ( and the world ) really does need a transformative infrastructure plan .
