Scalia also helped overturn a Maryland law in 2006 that would have required big companies such as Walmart to spend more on employee health care in the state . That law ran afoul of a federal statute aimed at reducing red tape for certain national employers , who otherwise would have had to afford significantly different benefits to employees depending on their state of employment .\nThe Wall Street Journal wrote in 2012 that Scalia `` has emerged as one of the industry 's go-to guys for challenging financial regulations .

Scalia also was a speechwriter for Education Secretary William Bennett .\nIn 2018 , Scalia secured a win for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce by convincing a judge to overturn the Labor Department 's Obama-era 2016 fiduciary rule governing retirement account advisers , which Scalia said had `` very serious problems . '' A judge agreed with conservatives who said the Obama administration had `` overreached '' in how it classified advisers as fiduciaries , who were therefore obligated to act in their clients ' best interests -- and put clients ' interests ahead of concerns for their own compensation .\nCHRISTOPHER SCALIA ADDRESSES LIBERAL ARGUMENTS TO EXPAND THE SUPREME COURT\nThe Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found fatal problems in how the rule defined advisers and `` financial advice , '' and critics said the rule made it harder to charge commissions and earn profit from advising smaller accounts .\nRepublicans , late Thursday , praised Scalia 's nomination . Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton called Scalia an `` outstanding lawyer who has vigorously defended the Constitution over a long career in government and private practice . ''\nHe added , `` I \u2019 m confident he \u2019 ll be a champion for working Americans against red tape and burdensome regulation as Labor Secretary . ''\nIn announcing Scalia 's selection , Trump sounded notes of praise not only for the nominee , but also for his own administration .\n`` I am pleased to announce that it is my intention to nominate Gene Scalia as the new Secretary of Labor , '' Trump wrote in a tweet late Thursday . `` Gene has led a life of great success in the legal and labor field and is highly respected not only as a lawyer , but as a lawyer with great experience working with labor and everyone else .
