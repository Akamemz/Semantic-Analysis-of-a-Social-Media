Pollsters measure that with questions such as : Does the candidate \u201c understand \u201d or \u201c care about \u201d people like you ?\nIn 2012 , Romney failed the empathy test big time , losing the \u201c care about \u201d question 81 to 18 percent against President Obama in national exit polling \u2013 even though he led in every other category that voters said mattered most in making their decision ( leadership , vision , and values ) .\nThe empathy question is \u201c very , very important , and probably in the end is the ultimate criteria , \u201d says Democratic pollster Celinda Lake .\nThe question \u201c is particularly important right now because voters think politicians are out of touch with their lives .

Ultimately , people want to see policies as well . \u201d\nOn Monday evening , Rubio poured on the empathy and optimism , even as he warned about a \u201c diminished \u201d America and endangered opportunity for all .
