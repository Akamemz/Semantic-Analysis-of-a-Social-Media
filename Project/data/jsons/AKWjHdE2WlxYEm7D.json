But relatively few Americans have a lot of confidence in their own ability to check the accuracy of the news and information they come across related to the coronavirus .\nAbout three-in-ten U.S. adults ( 28 % ) say they are very confident that they would know what steps to take to check the accuracy of news and information about the coronavirus outbreak . A slightly smaller portion ( 22 % ) say they are not too or not at all confident , while the largest share \u2013 around half ( 49 % ) \u2013 express some confidence . These findings come from a \u2588\u2588\u2588 survey conducted April 20 to 26 among 10,139 adults who are part of the Center \u2019 s American Trends Panel .\nAmericans \u2019 confidence in checking COVID-19 information aligns closely with their confidence in checking the accuracy of news stories more broadly . In early 2019 , 29 % of Americans said they were very confident that they would know what steps to take to check the accuracy of news stories ( regardless of the specific subject matter ) , and 24 % said they were not too or not at all confident . Again , the largest share ( 46 % ) said they were somewhat confident .\nThis analysis of Americans \u2019 confidence in their ability to fact check COVID-19 information is based on a survey of 10,139 U.S. adults conducted April 20-26 , 2020 . Everyone who took part in the survey is a member of \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s American Trends Panel , an online survey panel that is recruited through national , random sampling of residential addresses . Recruiting our panelists by phone or mail ensures that nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection . This gives us confidence that any sample can represent the whole population ( see our Methods 101 explainer on random sampling ) . To further ensure that each survey reflects a balanced cross section of the nation , the data is weighted to match the U.S. adult population by gender , race , ethnicity , partisan affiliation , education and other categories . Here are the questions asked in this survey , along with responses , and the methodology . This analysis was made possible by The Pew Charitable Trusts , which received support from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation .\nIn the new survey , Americans who think highly of the news media \u2019 s coverage of the coronavirus outbreak are much more confident in their own ability to check the facts .\nAround four-in-ten ( 43 % ) of those Americans who think the news media are covering the outbreak very well say they are very confident in their own ability to check the accuracy of COVID-19 information . That compares with around a quarter of those who think the media are doing somewhat well ( 23 % ) or not too or not at all well ( 24 % ) at covering the outbreak . Views of the news media \u2019 s coverage of the outbreak align closely with people \u2019 s confidence in their own fact-checking abilities even after accounting for how closely Americans are paying attention to COVID-19 news .\nIn both partisan coalitions , relatively few people are highly confident in their ability to check the accuracy of COVID-19 news and information , though there are some differences by party . A third of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents ( 33 % ) feel very confident , 10 percentage points higher than the portion of Republicans and Republican leaners who express a high level of confidence ( 23 % ) . Republicans , on the other hand , are 10 points more likely than Democrats to feel not too or not at all confident ( 27 % vs. 17 % ) .\nModest differences also emerge by demographic characteristics , most notably by level of education and race and ethnicity . About a third of Americans who have at least a bachelor \u2019 s degree ( 35 % ) feel highly confident in their own ability to check COVID-19 news and information , somewhat higher than the share among those who have some college education ( 28 % ) and those who have a high school diploma or less ( 24 % ) .
