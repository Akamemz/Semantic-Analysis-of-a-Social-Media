Today , a third of Democrats\u2014and nearly half of Republicans\u2014would be deeply upset . Americans not only disagree on the issues , they increasingly personally dislike those from the other party . To find out how this deepening divide might affect business issues , a team of researchers conducted four experiments . All four offer evidence that partisanship influences economic behavior . For example , in an experiment conducted in an online labor market , people were willing to work for less money for fellow partisans ; this effect is as large as the effect of factors like relevant employment experience . A second study examining consumer behavior found that consumers were almost twice as likely to engage in a transaction when their partisanship matched that of the seller . In a survey , three-quarters of all subjects refused a higher monetary payment to avoid helping the other party\u2014 in other words , they preferred to make themselves worse off so that they would not benefit the other party .
