    "content": "Thousands rallied in Washington , DC , on Saturday for a March for Our Lives protest to advocate for gun control . Thousands more joined them at other marches in cities large and small across the country .\nThe march marked most dramatic and powerful show yet of teenage activism against gun violence in the wake of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland , Florida . Close to a million students stood up and streamed out of classrooms across the country last week as part of the National School Walkout , which honored the victims of the Parkland shooting one month ago and called on lawmakers to pass gun control legislation . Another national school walkout is planned for April 20 , the anniversary of the Columbine shooting .\nBut the March for Our Lives signals that this renewed push for gun reform is gathering strength . It \u2019 s sign that this time might actually be different .\nParkland survivors spearheaded the March , and many of the leaders of the movement \u2014 Cameron Kasky , David Hogg , Delaney Tarr , among them \u2014 delivered passionate , wrenching , and sometimes angry speeches . Sarah Chadwick , held up an orange tag with the amount of $ 1.05 cents \u2014 the amount of Sen. Marco Rubio \u2019 s NRA donation divided by the number of students in Florida . Emma Gonzalez honored the 17 people killed with a speech and a moment of silence , lasting 6 minutes and 20 seconds , the total time it took the Parkland gunman to carry out his massacre .\nAlongside the Parkland survivors , activists and gun violence survivors from Chicago , Washington , D.C. , New York , and Los Angeles shared their frustration , their hurt , and their next steps . Edna Chavez , 17 , from Los Angeles , lost her brother to gun violence , saying it was normal in her neighborhood to see candles , posters , balloons , and flowers . Mya Middleton , a 16-year-old student from Chicago , recalled staring down the barrel of a pistol . \u201c He said , \u2018 If you say anything , I will find you. \u2019 And yet I \u2019 m still saying something today , \u201d \u201c she said .\nThousands of other students participated in sibling marches across the country , joining the crowds that packed the streets of Washington , D.C .\nHaley Zink , a 21-year-old community college student who helped to organize a \u201c sibling march \u201d in St. Louis , Missouri , had a message for those who think this movement is just a bunch of loud kids : \u201c I want to it be clear to everyone that , no we are not . \u201d\nThey have a plan , she said . \u201c Just because of our age , that doesn \u2019 t mean we can \u2019 t be structured and be smart about our actions because this is about our future , \u201d she said . \u201c This is the world we grew up in , and this is the world we have sitting out in front of us . Most of us have never gone to school in a place where gun violence was not normalized , and that is not okay . And so we have to take it in our hands to fix it . \u201d\nSurvivors of the school shooting in Parkland organized the March for Our Lives in DC , on March 24 with the support of Everytown for Gun Safety , a gun law reform advocacy group .\n\u201c Politicians either represent the people or get out , \u201d Parkland survivor Cameron Kasky boomed from the podium during the rally . \u201c The people demand a law banning the sale of assault weapons . The people demand that we prohibit the sale of high capacity magazines . The people demand universal background checks . Stand for us or beware . The voters are coming . \u201d\nIn Washington , protesters rallied along Pennsylvania Avenue starting at noon -- though students , parents , and others began showing up with their signs much earlier . The demonstration was expected to draw as many as 500,000 people to the nation \u2019 s capital .\n\u201c It starts here , \u201d said Krista Vanderpuye , a 17-year-old student at Lake Braddock High School in Virginia , who attended the March in D.C. on Saturday . \u201c But it doesn \u2019 t end here . \u201d\nMore than 800 \u201c sibling marches \u201d were also planned worldwide , from Maui to Lincoln , Nebraska , to Portsmouth , New Hampshire , to Hong Kong . Organizers hosted rallies in large cities , in small towns , in blue states , in deep-red pockets , in places where guns are knitted into everyday life .\nZink , in St. Louis , said their event will focus not just on school shootings , but the violence that punctuates life for some teenagers in places like east St. Louis . \u201c It \u2019 s so much bigger than schools , \u201d Zink said . \u201c So using this political movement to get everyone to paying attention to how bad it is here , and how can we fix that . \u201d\nThe \u201c sibling marches , \u201d like the main event in Washington , D.C. included speeches from students about their fears , and their anger , their plans to fight gun violence . Zink \u2019 s will feature activists , a mother , a youth from Chicago , a local politician . They consider the march nonpartisan , and invited anyone running for office to attend .\nHamdia Ahmed , a 20-year-old college student and activist , was supposed to speak on the steps of city hall at a rally in Portland , Maine . \u201c This is about the safety of the citizens and our leaders just really need to step up , \u201d she told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .\nShe remembers Sandy Hook , watching it on TV , and how it worked its way into her consciousness . \u201c Some of us when we walk into schools we always think about where we want to sit and where is the safest place is for us to sit in case an active shooter was to come in , \u201d Ahmed said . \u201c Do you know how terrifying that is ? It \u2019 s like they \u2019 re creating this whole trauma within this generation of mass shootings . \u201d\n\u201c They \u201d for Ahmed , are those in government who are failing to act . She , and other organizers , want to get lawmakers \u2019 attention with these marches . Let them know they \u2019 re not going away .\nBrock Pate , an 18-year-old high school senior , is organizing a march in Hickory , North Carolina , about an hour outside Charlotte . It will be small by DC standards \u2014 135 have said they \u2019 d attend , about 300 are interested . The participants have a list of talking points : universal background checks , banning assault weapons for civilians , and better mental-health reporting to NICS . \u201c This does not end after March 24 , \u201d he said . \u201c Or even after April 20 . \u201d\nMaria Maring , 18 , and Alexis Jones , 17 , both seniors at Carbondale High School in Illinois said the march is about honoring the people who weren \u2019 t as lucky as they are . Jones said , everyone thinks \u201c this will never happen to us. \u201d After a shooting , it transforms to \u201c how could this happen to us ? \u201d They are trying to interrupt that cycle , protect themselves , and others , from joining that sorrowful group .\nMaring and Jones said they never had a big incident -- a shooting \u2014 at their school . But the threat loomed . \u201c We \u2019 ve been on lockdown before , there have been rumors , there have been police in our hallways searching for whatever kid that made whatever threat , \u201d Maring said . Her generation , she added , has been trained to be paranoid . \u201c You don \u2019 t know who has a gun under their coat , \u201d she said .\nIt is why Jones and Maring were a little worried before the march . The Illinois Rifle Association appeared to be planning counter protests , including one in their town . Jones said it \u2019 s worth it to go forward , and she \u2019 d tell anyone else to do the same .\n\u201c If I \u2019 m being completely honest , I \u2019 m kind of terrified about Saturday , \u201d Maring said . \u201c There will be opposition . This is such a controversial subject , I don \u2019 t want somebody to bring a gun to the march , and that is what is on my mind \u2014 that someone will come and turn this peaceful event into another tragedy , which is what we \u2019 re trying to prevent . \u201d\nOwen Edwards , a 21-year-old student at the University of North Alabama in Florence , was a little nervous , too . Before the march , he worked on his speech , trying to find a way to appeal to parents , to help people understand the huge responsibility of owning guns , of something that can injure and kill . To give that speech , he would be exposed , the center of attention . \u201c We all just kind of looked at each other , \u201d Edwards said of himself and fellow organizers , \u201c and said , \u2018 what if we get shot ? \u2019 \u201d\n\u201c That \u2019 s a fear that we used to not have as Americans , in general , \u201d Edwards added . \u201c But it \u2019 s looming in all in our minds now : What if we get shot ? \u201d\nA month after the march , students will walk out of classrooms against on April 20 , the 19th anniversary of the Columbine school shooting in Colorado . Lane Murdock , a sophomore at Ridgefield High School in Connecticut came up with the idea and started an online petition immediately after the Parkland shooting ; she was tired of how numb America was becoming to yet another school shooting . \u201c But I also just felt really powerless , \u201d she told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . So , she thought , \u201c what could I do to help other kids who felt really powerless ? \u201d\nOn the day of the Parkland shooting , Valentine \u2019 s Day , she said , she created a petition : a rough outline of what she wanted to see happen , which was for kids to pledge to walk out . \u201c It kind of blew up overnight , \u201d she said .\nToday \u2019 s energy has been incredible , and we \u2019 ve shown the world that we \u2019 re serious .\nWe have to keep the momentum going with the April 20th # NationalSchoolWalkout .\nNext month , even more people will stand up to demand change .\nWe will not give up . \u2014 National School Walkout ( @ schoolwalkoutUS ) March 14 , 2018\nIndivisible , a progressive organizing group founded after the 2016 election , is backing the April 20 walkout and helping Murdock and some of her fellow students organize .\nSome students who participated in the March 14 walkout told \u2588\u2588\u2588 they would also demonstrate on April 20 , though not all had events planned . Students at more than 1,500 schools have signed up so far , though that number will probably balloon as the date gets closer .\n\u201c April 20 isn \u2019 t the end of this , \u201d Murdock said . \u201c April 20 is the launch . We want to make sure we take all this momentum , power , and interest and turn it into concrete , actual change . \u201d\nTeen activism is driving a new push for gun control\nThe Parkland survivors ignited a new gun control movement by finding a platform in their tragedy . David Hogg rode his bike to school after the shooting to film as a journalist and then found himself on Fox News , where he said there couldn \u2019 t be another mass shooting . Emma Gonzalez \u2019 s speech led to a chant : \u201c We call BS. \u201d Cameron Kasky challenged Florida Sen. Marco Rubio on accepting donations from the National Rifle Association during a CNN town hall .\nStudent activists are tired of being numb to school shootings , of simply moving on , of referring to \u201c another \u201d school shooting . Some have watched guns steal away family , friends , and classmates .\nKari Gottfried , a junior at Corvallis High School in Oregon , is 17 ; she wasn \u2019 t even born when the shooting at Columbine High School happened . \u201c I \u2019 ve never known a world where there aren \u2019 t mass shootings , \u201d she said .\nGottfried and her fellow student activists feel this issue personally . They were in middle school when the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting happened \u2014 old enough to understand the savagery , young enough to remember their own elementary school classrooms . They \u2019 ve grown up with active shooter drills , watched protocol morph in response to the latest tragedy . Gottfried said that now if the fire alarm goes off , students are told to go into lockdown mode . \u201c It \u2019 s more likely there would be a shooter than a fire in Corvallis , \u201d she said .\n\u201c We \u2019 re no strangers to gun violence , \u201d Fiorina Talaba , an 18-year-old senior from Carson High in California , said of herself and her fellow students . \u201c When we heard about the shooting in Florida , it really spoke to us , and we wanted to have some type of change . \u201d\nThe teenage activists have another thing in common : social media . Students across the country are connecting with each other , sharing strategies and stories . Maxwell Nardi , an 18-year-old senior at Douglas S. Freeman High School in Richmond , Virginia , made the case that those who demeaned his generation for being obsessed with their phones are in for their own awakening . \u201c We \u2019 re fighting for this issue , we \u2019 re making our voices these tools , \u201d he said .\nArielle Geismar , a 16-year-old junior at the Beacon School in Manhattan , is organizing a bus to DC for the March for Our Lives . She said she felt an \u201c urgency of collaboration . \u201d\n\u201c Our generation is so easily discredited as the social media generation , always on our phones , \u201d she said . \u201c But look what social media has done for this movement . It turned into this national thing . \u201d\nStudents pushed for gun law reform with the National School Walkout . They \u2019 re focusing on small actions \u2014 what teenagers can do to get more involved , including registering to vote and writing to lawmakers .\nBut they can already claim some victories . The big one : refusing to let the country move on and forget .\nThat has put pressure on lawmakers to act . Staunchly pro-gun Florida bucked the NRA to pass the first gun restrictions in the state in more than 20 years , in consultation with the families of Parkland victims . The law increased the age to purchase a firearm to 21 , instituted a three-day waiting period , and created a system for police to petition to remove guns from someone deemed a threat . It put millions of dollars toward school safety and mental health initiatives , though it included a controversial , voluntary program to arm some school employees .\nDozens of other states passed new gun safety measured in the aftermath of Parkland or are mulling new restrictions . Kansas , New York , and some other states are considering legislation similar to Florida \u2019 s that would allow for judges to temporarily remove guns if people are deemed a threat . These \u201c red flag laws \u201d existed in five states before the Parkland shooting . Rhode Island \u2019 s governor signed an executive order to institute such a policy after Parkland .\nWashington state banned bump stocks , devices that effectively let semiautomatic weapons function like fully automatic ones . Cincinnati , Ohio , wants to do the same . Illinois is trying to pass a measure that would require criminal background checks for all gun shop employees ; the Parkland shooting has reanimated debate over the legislation .\nAnd some states have backed away from loosening gun control laws . Iowa is letting a bill die that would have removed the permit requirement to carry weapons .\nThe Trump administration took steps to ban bump stocks in the wake of Parkland and released a school safety plan . It calls for \u201c risk protection orders \u201d to confiscate weapons from those deemed a threat and has a proposal to arm teachers . The White House \u2019 s plan is largely NRA-friendly \u2014 but the administration did not take similar action in the wake of massacres in Las Vegas or Sutherland Springs .\nEven Congress has taken action . Lawmakers passed Fix NICS Act , a bipartisan plan first introduced after the Sutherland Springs , Texas , shooting to strengthen the background check reporting system , in its omnibus spending bill . That package also included the STOP School Violence Act of 2018 , doesn \u2019 t include any specific gun control measures , but increases grants for school safety measures , such as security training and metal detectors . Finally , lawmakers took a small but potentially important step toward allowing Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) study gun violence .\nStudent activists said they \u2019 re open to different ideas and debates about the Second Amendment . Their goals vary , but most but agree on measures that have broad public support , such as universal background checks .\nElizabeth Love , a 17-year-old advocate and march organizer in Salt Lake City , said mentioned parts of their platform , which includes universal background checks and a waiting period for gun purchases . She is adamant their march , and their movement , is not anti-gun . \u201c I want to make clear that we support the Second Amendment , \u201d she told \u2588\u2588\u2588 . \u201c I don \u2019 t want our message to get twisted by those who oppose us , and so I want to be clear we support reforms that are constitutional , and we are being careful about that and we \u2019 re doing our research . \u201d\nGeismar said she and her fellow activists are just looking for middle ground . \u201c It \u2019 s not Republican or Democrat ; it \u2019 s about keeping people safe , \u201d she said .\nTalaba said she and her fellow students were focused particularly on mental health . She believes tighter background checks will help . But she also sees that as a first incremental , achievable step .\nThe walkout and other events are a chance to stake out their role in this debate . \u201c I just don \u2019 t like how congressmen , or these older people , just don \u2019 t see that even us kids , we can have these very serious conversations , \u201d Talaba said . \u201c We know what we want from our society : to have less guns and , at some point , no guns at all . \u201d\nThese demonstrations are also a reminder for lawmakers to listen and take these student activists seriously . All they can do now is lobby for change . But soon they \u2019 ll be the ones with the power to decide politicians \u2019 fates \u2014 if not in 2018 , then in 2020 .\nBut it \u2019 s bigger than elections , and uncomfortable conversations . As Nardi , the senior from Richmond said , \u201c This is literally matter of life and death . \u201d",
    "content_original": "Thousands rallied in Washington, DC, on Saturday for a March for Our Lives protest to advocate for gun control. Thousands more joined them at other marches in cities large and small across the country.\n\nTheir motto is \u201cnever again.\u201d\n\nThe march marked most dramatic and powerful show yet of teenage activism against gun violence in the wake of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Close to a million students stood up and streamed out of classrooms across the country last week as part of the National School Walkout, which honored the victims of the Parkland shooting one month ago and called on lawmakers to pass gun control legislation. Another national school walkout is planned for April 20, the anniversary of the Columbine shooting.\n\nBut the March for Our Lives signals that this renewed push for gun reform is gathering strength. It\u2019s sign that this time might actually be different.\n\nParkland survivors spearheaded the March, and many of the leaders of the movement \u2014 Cameron Kasky, David Hogg, Delaney Tarr, among them \u2014 delivered passionate, wrenching, and sometimes angry speeches. Sarah Chadwick, held up an orange tag with the amount of $1.05 cents \u2014 the amount of Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s NRA donation divided by the number of students in Florida. Emma Gonzalez honored the 17 people killed with a speech and a moment of silence, lasting 6 minutes and 20 seconds, the total time it took the Parkland gunman to carry out his massacre.\n\nAlongside the Parkland survivors, activists and gun violence survivors from Chicago, Washington, D.C., New York, and Los Angeles shared their frustration, their hurt, and their next steps. Edna Chavez, 17, from Los Angeles, lost her brother to gun violence, saying it was normal in her neighborhood to see candles, posters, balloons, and flowers. Mya Middleton, a 16-year-old student from Chicago, recalled staring down the barrel of a pistol. \u201cHe said, \u2018If you say anything, I will find you.\u2019 And yet I\u2019m still saying something today,\u201d \u201c she said.\n\nThousands of other students participated in sibling marches across the country, joining the crowds that packed the streets of Washington, D.C.\n\nHaley Zink, a 21-year-old community college student who helped to organize a \u201csibling march\u201d in St. Louis, Missouri, had a message for those who think this movement is just a bunch of loud kids: \u201cI want to it be clear to everyone that, no we are not.\u201d\n\nThey have a plan, she said. \u201cJust because of our age, that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t be structured and be smart about our actions because this is about our future,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the world we grew up in, and this is the world we have sitting out in front of us. Most of us have never gone to school in a place where gun violence was not normalized, and that is not okay. And so we have to take it in our hands to fix it.\u201d\n\nThe March for Our Lives drew thousands to D.C.\n\nSurvivors of the school shooting in Parkland organized the March for Our Lives in DC, on March 24 with the support of Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun law reform advocacy group.\n\n\u201cPoliticians either represent the people or get out,\u201d Parkland survivor Cameron Kasky boomed from the podium during the rally. \u201cThe people demand a law banning the sale of assault weapons. The people demand that we prohibit the sale of high capacity magazines. The people demand universal background checks. Stand for us or beware. The voters are coming.\u201d\n\nIn Washington, protesters rallied along Pennsylvania Avenue starting at noon -- though students, parents, and others began showing up with their signs much earlier. The demonstration was expected to draw as many as 500,000 people to the nation\u2019s capital.\n\n\u201cIt starts here,\u201d said Krista Vanderpuye, a 17-year-old student at Lake Braddock High School in Virginia, who attended the March in D.C. on Saturday. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t end here.\u201d\n\nActivists join in \u201csibling marches\u201d across the country\n\nMore than 800 \u201csibling marches\u201d were also planned worldwide, from Maui to Lincoln, Nebraska, to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to Hong Kong. Organizers hosted rallies in large cities, in small towns, in blue states, in deep-red pockets, in places where guns are knitted into everyday life.\n\nZink, in St. Louis, said their event will focus not just on school shootings, but the violence that punctuates life for some teenagers in places like east St. Louis. \u201cIt\u2019s so much bigger than schools,\u201d Zink said. \u201cSo using this political movement to get everyone to paying attention to how bad it is here, and how can we fix that.\u201d\n\nThe \u201csibling marches,\u201d like the main event in Washington, D.C. included speeches from students about their fears, and their anger, their plans to fight gun violence. Zink\u2019s will feature activists, a mother, a youth from Chicago, a local politician. They consider the march nonpartisan, and invited anyone running for office to attend.\n\nHamdia Ahmed, a 20-year-old college student and activist, was supposed to speak on the steps of city hall at a rally in Portland, Maine. \u201cThis is about the safety of the citizens and our leaders just really need to step up,\u201d she told Vox.\n\nShe remembers Sandy Hook, watching it on TV, and how it worked its way into her consciousness. \u201cSome of us when we walk into schools we always think about where we want to sit and where is the safest place is for us to sit in case an active shooter was to come in,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cDo you know how terrifying that is? It\u2019s like they\u2019re creating this whole trauma within this generation of mass shootings.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u201d for Ahmed, are those in government who are failing to act. She, and other organizers, want to get lawmakers\u2019 attention with these marches. Let them know they\u2019re not going away.\n\nBrock Pate, an 18-year-old high school senior, is organizing a march in Hickory, North Carolina, about an hour outside Charlotte. It will be small by DC standards \u2014 135 have said they\u2019d attend, about 300 are interested. The participants have a list of talking points: universal background checks, banning assault weapons for civilians, and better mental-health reporting to NICS. \u201cThis does not end after March 24,\u201d he said. \u201cOr even after April 20.\u201d\n\nMaria Maring, 18, and Alexis Jones, 17, both seniors at Carbondale High School in Illinois said the march is about honoring the people who weren\u2019t as lucky as they are. Jones said, everyone thinks \u201cthis will never happen to us.\u201d After a shooting, it transforms to \u201chow could this happen to us?\u201d They are trying to interrupt that cycle, protect themselves, and others, from joining that sorrowful group.\n\nMaring and Jones said they never had a big incident -- a shooting \u2014 at their school. But the threat loomed. \u201cWe\u2019ve been on lockdown before, there have been rumors, there have been police in our hallways searching for whatever kid that made whatever threat,\u201d Maring said. Her generation, she added, has been trained to be paranoid. \u201cYou don\u2019t know who has a gun under their coat,\u201d she said.\n\nIt is why Jones and Maring were a little worried before the march. The Illinois Rifle Association appeared to be planning counter protests, including one in their town. Jones said it\u2019s worth it to go forward, and she\u2019d tell anyone else to do the same.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m being completely honest, I\u2019m kind of terrified about Saturday,\u201d Maring said. \u201cThere will be opposition. This is such a controversial subject, I don\u2019t want somebody to bring a gun to the march, and that is what is on my mind \u2014 that someone will come and turn this peaceful event into another tragedy, which is what we\u2019re trying to prevent.\u201d\n\nOwen Edwards, a 21-year-old student at the University of North Alabama in Florence, was a little nervous, too. Before the march, he worked on his speech, trying to find a way to appeal to parents, to help people understand the huge responsibility of owning guns, of something that can injure and kill. To give that speech, he would be exposed, the center of attention. \u201cWe all just kind of looked at each other,\u201d Edwards said of himself and fellow organizers, \u201cand said, \u2018what if we get shot?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a fear that we used to not have as Americans, in general,\u201d Edwards added. \u201cBut it\u2019s looming in all in our minds now: What if we get shot?\u201d\n\nExpect another big walkout on April 20\n\nA month after the march, students will walk out of classrooms against on April 20, the 19th anniversary of the Columbine school shooting in Colorado. Lane Murdock, a sophomore at Ridgefield High School in Connecticut came up with the idea and started an online petition immediately after the Parkland shooting; she was tired of how numb America was becoming to yet another school shooting. \u201cBut I also just felt really powerless,\u201d she told Vox. So, she thought, \u201cwhat could I do to help other kids who felt really powerless?\u201d\n\nOn the day of the Parkland shooting, Valentine\u2019s Day, she said, she created a petition: a rough outline of what she wanted to see happen, which was for kids to pledge to walk out. \u201cIt kind of blew up overnight,\u201d she said.\n\nToday\u2019s energy has been incredible, and we\u2019ve shown the world that we\u2019re serious.\n\n\n\nBut this isn\u2019t the end.\n\n\n\nWe have to keep the momentum going with the April 20th #NationalSchoolWalkout.\n\n\n\nNext month, even more people will stand up to demand change.\n\n\n\nWe will not give up. \u2014 National School Walkout (@schoolwalkoutUS) March 14, 2018\n\nIndivisible, a progressive organizing group founded after the 2016 election, is backing the April 20 walkout and helping Murdock and some of her fellow students organize.\n\nSome students who participated in the March 14 walkout told Vox they would also demonstrate on April 20, though not all had events planned. Students at more than 1,500 schools have signed up so far, though that number will probably balloon as the date gets closer.\n\n\u201cApril 20 isn\u2019t the end of this,\u201d Murdock said. \u201cApril 20 is the launch. We want to make sure we take all this momentum, power, and interest and turn it into concrete, actual change.\u201d\n\nTeen activism is driving a new push for gun control\n\nThe Parkland survivors ignited a new gun control movement by finding a platform in their tragedy. David Hogg rode his bike to school after the shooting to film as a journalist and then found himself on Fox News, where he said there couldn\u2019t be another mass shooting. Emma Gonzalez\u2019s speech led to a chant: \u201cWe call BS.\u201d Cameron Kasky challenged Florida Sen. Marco Rubio on accepting donations from the National Rifle Association during a CNN town hall.\n\nStudent activists are tired of being numb to school shootings, of simply moving on, of referring to \u201canother\u201d school shooting. Some have watched guns steal away family, friends, and classmates.\n\nKari Gottfried, a junior at Corvallis High School in Oregon, is 17; she wasn\u2019t even born when the shooting at Columbine High School happened. \u201cI\u2019ve never known a world where there aren\u2019t mass shootings,\u201d she said.\n\nGottfried and her fellow student activists feel this issue personally. They were in middle school when the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting happened \u2014 old enough to understand the savagery, young enough to remember their own elementary school classrooms. They\u2019ve grown up with active shooter drills, watched protocol morph in response to the latest tragedy. Gottfried said that now if the fire alarm goes off, students are told to go into lockdown mode. \u201cIt\u2019s more likely there would be a shooter than a fire in Corvallis,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re no strangers to gun violence,\u201d Fiorina Talaba, an 18-year-old senior from Carson High in California, said of herself and her fellow students. \u201cWhen we heard about the shooting in Florida, it really spoke to us, and we wanted to have some type of change.\u201d\n\nThe teenage activists have another thing in common: social media. Students across the country are connecting with each other, sharing strategies and stories. Maxwell Nardi, an 18-year-old senior at Douglas S. Freeman High School in Richmond, Virginia, made the case that those who demeaned his generation for being obsessed with their phones are in for their own awakening. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting for this issue, we\u2019re making our voices these tools,\u201d he said.\n\nArielle Geismar, a 16-year-old junior at the Beacon School in Manhattan, is organizing a bus to DC for the March for Our Lives. She said she felt an \u201curgency of collaboration.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur generation is so easily discredited as the social media generation, always on our phones,\u201d she said. \u201cBut look what social media has done for this movement. It turned into this national thing.\u201d\n\nThe public pressure has pushed lawmakers to act\n\nStudents pushed for gun law reform with the National School Walkout. They\u2019re focusing on small actions \u2014 what teenagers can do to get more involved, including registering to vote and writing to lawmakers.\n\nBut they can already claim some victories. The big one: refusing to let the country move on and forget.\n\nThat has put pressure on lawmakers to act. Staunchly pro-gun Florida bucked the NRA to pass the first gun restrictions in the state in more than 20 years, in consultation with the families of Parkland victims. The law increased the age to purchase a firearm to 21, instituted a three-day waiting period, and created a system for police to petition to remove guns from someone deemed a threat. It put millions of dollars toward school safety and mental health initiatives, though it included a controversial, voluntary program to arm some school employees.\n\nDozens of other states passed new gun safety measured in the aftermath of Parkland or are mulling new restrictions. Kansas, New York, and some other states are considering legislation similar to Florida\u2019s that would allow for judges to temporarily remove guns if people are deemed a threat. These \u201cred flag laws\u201d existed in five states before the Parkland shooting. Rhode Island\u2019s governor signed an executive order to institute such a policy after Parkland.\n\nWashington state banned bump stocks, devices that effectively let semiautomatic weapons function like fully automatic ones. Cincinnati, Ohio, wants to do the same. Illinois is trying to pass a measure that would require criminal background checks for all gun shop employees; the Parkland shooting has reanimated debate over the legislation.\n\nAnd some states have backed away from loosening gun control laws. Iowa is letting a bill die that would have removed the permit requirement to carry weapons.\n\nThe Trump administration took steps to ban bump stocks in the wake of Parkland and released a school safety plan. It calls for \u201crisk protection orders\u201d to confiscate weapons from those deemed a threat and has a proposal to arm teachers. The White House\u2019s plan is largely NRA-friendly \u2014 but the administration did not take similar action in the wake of massacres in Las Vegas or Sutherland Springs.\n\nEven Congress has taken action. Lawmakers passed Fix NICS Act, a bipartisan plan first introduced after the Sutherland Springs, Texas, shooting to strengthen the background check reporting system, in its omnibus spending bill. That package also included the STOP School Violence Act of 2018, doesn\u2019t include any specific gun control measures, but increases grants for school safety measures, such as security training and metal detectors. Finally, lawmakers took a small but potentially important step toward allowing Centers for Disease Control (CDC) study gun violence.\n\nStudent activists said they\u2019re open to different ideas and debates about the Second Amendment. Their goals vary, but most but agree on measures that have broad public support, such as universal background checks.\n\nElizabeth Love, a 17-year-old advocate and march organizer in Salt Lake City, said mentioned parts of their platform, which includes universal background checks and a waiting period for gun purchases. She is adamant their march, and their movement, is not anti-gun. \u201cI want to make clear that we support the Second Amendment,\u201d she told Vox. \u201cI don\u2019t want our message to get twisted by those who oppose us, and so I want to be clear we support reforms that are constitutional, and we are being careful about that and we\u2019re doing our research.\u201d\n\nGeismar said she and her fellow activists are just looking for middle ground. \u201cIt\u2019s not Republican or Democrat; it\u2019s about keeping people safe,\u201d she said.\n\nTalaba said she and her fellow students were focused particularly on mental health. She believes tighter background checks will help. But she also sees that as a first incremental, achievable step.\n\nThe walkout and other events are a chance to stake out their role in this debate. \u201cI just don\u2019t like how congressmen, or these older people, just don\u2019t see that even us kids, we can have these very serious conversations,\u201d Talaba said. \u201cWe know what we want from our society: to have less guns and, at some point, no guns at all.\u201d\n\nThese demonstrations are also a reminder for lawmakers to listen and take these student activists seriously. All they can do now is lobby for change. But soon they\u2019ll be the ones with the power to decide politicians\u2019 fates \u2014 if not in 2018, then in 2020.\n\nBut it\u2019s bigger than elections, and uncomfortable conversations. As Nardi, the senior from Richmond said, \u201cThis is literally matter of life and death.\u201d",
