    "content": "One of my favorite writers , Gore Vidal , once described his country as the United States of Amnesia . \u201c We learn nothing because we remember nothing , \u201d he wrote .\nVidal \u2019 s point is simple enough : America \u2019 s concept of itself is shaped by mythology , not by facts . And it \u2019 s harder to address mistakes if you \u2019 re unwilling to face them honestly .\nIn 1995 , James Loewen set out to resolve this problem . He published a landmark book , Lies My Teacher Told Me , that went on to sell more than 2 million copies . Loewen taught race relations for two decades at the University of Vermont , and spent two years at the Smithsonian Institution , where he surveyed past American history textbooks .\nThe result of his research was a massive tome that pointed out all the distortions and falsehoods taught in US history classes .\nLike Howard Zinn famously did before him , Loewen shattered myths around Christopher Columbus , the first Thanksgiving , the Civil War , Helen Keller , Abraham Lincoln , American labor history , and the roots of racial inequalities . The problem , Loewen argued , was our impulse to turn historical events and figures into \u201c moral examples , \u201d which usually involved whitewashing the past in order to reinforce a familiar story about American greatness .\nLies My Teacher Told Me was recently republished , so I reached out to Loewen to talk about what has changed , what lies we still tell ourselves , and how he thinks about historical truth in the age of \u201c alternative facts . \u201d\nAccording to your book , the biggest lie we are taught in US history class is that the country started out great and we \u2019 ve just been getting better ever since .\nBut on a long enough timeline , isn \u2019 t this partially true ?\nIt \u2019 s true enough . My problem is the implication that progress is automatic , which it most certainly isn \u2019 t . Second , the idea that we \u2019 re always getting better keeps us from seeing those times when we \u2019 re getting worse .\nConsider the period of 1890-1940 , when race relations got systematically worse every year . America actually got more racist in its ideology than at any other time in history . After slavery , white people convinced themselves that there were equal opportunities , which was a lie . They told themselves that black people were criminals and incompetent and unable to succeed .\nThe point isn \u2019 t that life was better for people under slavery ; it \u2019 s that the story of moral and political progress isn \u2019 t so clear . And when we pretend that it is neat and clear , we cause teachers to teach and students to think that progress happens automatically , and that destroys the impulse to change things \u2014 to become an activist .\nThat \u2019 s an interesting question . I \u2019 d go back to 1892 , 400 years after Columbus is said to have discovered America . If you looked around the world at that time , white people dominated most of it . The big lie is our failure to ask how that came to pass . We simply assumed that we dominated because we were better , or smarter , or worked harder .\nSo much of what has passed as \u201c history \u201d since has been invested with white supremacy , even though the reasons why history unfolded the way it did are extremely complicated and have to do with luck , and geography , and all sorts of factors that aren \u2019 t captured in our oversimplified narratives .\nWe never seriously asked the question , and so white supremacy became the default answer . What could be more consequential than that ?\nIs a truly authoritative version of history ever possible ? Isn \u2019 t history always a self-serving narrative shaped by actors who are deeply invested in it ?\nYes and no . I certainly agree that a truly authoritative version of history , as you put it , isn \u2019 t possible . And there are always more perspectives , more questions , more things to learn . At the same time , we can take this too far and lose the capacity to say that one version of history is more authoritative than another version . And then we \u2019 re in the world of \u201c post-truth \u201d and \u201c alternative facts . \u201d\nEverything is not a matter of nuance : everything is not up for grabs . It is simply true , for example , that the South seceded from the Union because of slavery , and not because of states \u2019 rights . We know this to be true , and an alternative version of history that denies this is a lie . Period .\nWhy do high school history teachers continue to assign books that they know are filled with falsehoods ?\nI think a lot of them don \u2019 t even know they \u2019 re filled with lies . Many of them , it turns out , aren \u2019 t historians and haven \u2019 t taken a single course in US history in college . And yet here they are , teaching US history at the K-12 level .\nIf you don \u2019 t know any history , then you don \u2019 t know enough to teach the book and to say the book is lousy . Not only that , you have no interest in doing so because you \u2019 re relying on it . You \u2019 re using it as a crutch . You are teaching the book instead of teaching history , using the book . That \u2019 s a profound difference .\n\u201c Nothing good happens without the collective efforts of dedicated people \u201d\nWhat do you mean when you say that some history textbooks are \u201c anti-citizenship manuals \u201d or \u201c handbooks for acquiescence \u201d ?\nThat gets back to the point about progress . I think that textbooks fail to teach what causes what . Everything is just one damn thing after another . You need to learn all those little facts . Therefore , they fail to impart the idea that we , as people , should be trying to achieve things , things that won \u2019 t happen without our efforts .\nFor example , if we want to make our society less racist , there are certain things we \u2019 ll have to do , like we did between 1954 and 1974 . During this time , you could actually see our society become less racist both in attitudes and in terms of our social structures .\nIf we want to make society more racist , then we can do some of the things we did between 1890 and 1940 , because we can actually see our society becoming more racist both in practices and in attitudes . So by not teaching causation , we disempower people from doing anything .\nBy teaching that things are pretty much good and getting better automatically , we remove any reason for citizens to be citizens , to exercise the powers of citizenship . But that \u2019 s not how progress happens .\nNothing good happens without the collective efforts of dedicated people . History , the way it \u2019 s commonly taught , has a way of obscuring this fact .\nThe preface to your latest edition addresses the problem of truth in the age of Trump . How would you analyze what \u2019 s happening right now ?\nI actually think our situation is far worse than it was in the past . For example , our federal government , under Nixon and Johnson , lied to us about the Vietnam War , but they never made the case that facts don \u2019 t matter or that my facts are as good as your facts .\nThey assumed something had to be seen as true in order to matter , so they lied in order to further their agenda .\nTrump has basically introduced the idea that there is no such thing as facts , no such thing as truth \u2014 and that is fundamentally different . He is attacking the very idea of truth and thereby giving his opponents no ground to stand on at all . That \u2019 s a very dangerous road to go down , but that \u2019 s where we are .",
