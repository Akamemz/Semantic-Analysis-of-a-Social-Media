There was a time when candidates for office up and down the ballot would compete over who could be tougher on crime . But in this election , Democrats are competing to offer more freedom , more compassion , and more rehabilitation - not just more punishment .\nOn Thursday \u2019 s debate stage , in response to a question posed by a young African-American moderator , Linsey Davis , a few candidates finally got a moment on the debate stage to highlight their criminal justice plans .\n\u25cf Sen. Kamala Harris : \u201c My plan has been described by activists as being a bold and comprehensive plan that is about ending mass incarceration , about taking the profit out of the criminal justice system . I plan on shutting down for-profit prisons on day one . It will be about what we need to do to hold law enforcement , including prosecutors , accountable . And finally , my plan is about making sure that , in America 's criminal justice system , we de-incarcerate women and children , that we end solitary confinement and that we work on keeping families intact . \u201d\n\u25cf Sen. Cory Booker : \u201c I joined together and led in the United States Senate the only major bipartisan bill to pass under this president , for criminal justice reform , that has already led to thousands of people coming out of jail . If 87 members of the United States Senate says that these sentences are way too long , and we changed it , but we did n't make it retroactive , we could literally point to the people that are in jail unjustly right now . Everyone on this stage should say that we are going to give clemency to these 17,000 people . And I challenge you . Do n't just say a big statement ; back it up with details of the people in prison right now looking for one of the most sacrosanct ideals of this nation , which is liberty and freedom .
