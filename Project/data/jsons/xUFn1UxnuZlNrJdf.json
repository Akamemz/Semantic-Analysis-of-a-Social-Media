But Democrats defied those restrictions in June , using their cellphones to live-stream a 25-hour protest triggered by Ryan \u2019 s refusal to allow a gun-control vote .\nAfter Democrats seized the floor and refused to yield , Republicans shut down the chamber . C-SPAN had been airing the demonstration , but its cameras , which are controlled by the House majority , were turned off when the House shut down . The network then picked up a cellphone live-stream from one of the lawmakers protesting .\nRepublicans were incensed by the entire spectacle . For months GOP leaders met privately to craft a plan to either punish lawmakers who led the charge or write new rules to deter a similar future hijacking of legislative business . That led to Ryan \u2019 s current proposal .\nAs Democrats blasted the new rule Tuesday , House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( D-Calif. ) and lawyers representing the Democratic minority began examining its legality . \u201c We are reviewing this language as it appears to raise constitutional concerns , \u201d Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill told \u2588\u2588\u2588 in an email Tuesday .\nSome Democrats are itching for a fight over the rule . Rep. Eric Swalwell ( D-Calif. ) , one of the leaders of last summer \u2019 s protest , tweeted at Republicans to \u201c bring it on \u201d and dared them to \u201c fine me & @ HouseDemocrats all the way into bankruptcy for # gunviolence sit-in , but we will always speak for victims . ''\n\u201c If they cut the camera feed again , I \u2019 m going to turn on my phone again , \u201d Swalwell vowed during a brief interview Tuesday .\nRyan 's spokeswoman , AshLee Strong , dismissed the notion that the rule might be unconstitutional . Strong said the changes `` will help ensure that order and decorum are preserved in the House '' and pointed to existing automatic penalties for members who fail to file financial disclosure paperwork on time to argue that it 's not unprecedented .

If a lawmaker protests the sanctions , the matter goes to the full House floor . The body then decides with a vote whether the member is guilty and should be punished .\nRyan \u2019 s plan to essentially designate that power to the sergeant-at-arms \u201c could be a problem , \u201d said Stan Brand , a former longtime House counsel for the Democrats .\nDuring his stint on Capitol Hill , Brand said he litigated a dispute surrounding a century-old statute that barred members from taking pay for days they weren \u2019 t working . But while the statute gave the sergeant-at-arms the authority to deduct member pay , he \u201c never did , \u201d Brand said , \u201c because he never felt he had the power to do it . \u201d\nBrand said the sergeant-at-arms doesn \u2019 t have as many legal protections as lawmakers and could actually be sued by House members should they feel he unlawfully deducted their pay .

But he nonetheless wasn \u2019 t sure it was a good idea because it could open the door to the House delegating other duties to officers .\n\u201c Do members really want to start this ? \u201d he asked . \u201c Once you start delegating punishment to an officer , it raises a question of precedent and whether it can be expanded , and I think members will want to think carefully before they do this . \u201d\nWalker also noted that members don \u2019 t appear to have a venue to appeal the verdict : \u201c What happens when there is a difficult circumstance and one of the members thinks there ought to be a right to appeal ? Maybe you add that to the rule : a right to appeal . Members ought to have procedural rights as well . \u201d\nRepublicans could recraft the proposal to alleviate such concerns , but that might ultimately defeat their initial intent : deterring Democrats from future occupations of the chamber .\nOne option could be to have the ethics panel serve as an appeals panel . But , as Stern notes , the committee \u201c takes forever \u201d to litigate so \u201c I don \u2019 t think it would be as much of a deterrent. \u201d The panel is also evenly split between Democrats and Republicans , potentially allowing the minority to block a punishment .\nRepublicans could also amend the rule to force the House to vote to approve the sanctions on members . But that , in theory , would allow Democrats to continue the public spectacle Republicans are trying to quash , giving them an even larger platform for their cause .\n`` Look , I understand the Republicans are trying not to inflame things by coming up with something to put a stop on [ this protesting ] , but there is no way around them exercising their own authority to control breeches of decorum , '' Brand said . `` That \u2019 s the way do it \u2014 not by delegating it to some poor officer of the House . \u201d",
