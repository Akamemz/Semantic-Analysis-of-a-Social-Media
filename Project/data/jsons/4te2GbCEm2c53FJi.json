Now , they expect him to deliver .\nIn conversations on Capitol Hill , donor meetings in Texas and behind closed doors at the Ritz-Carlton in McLean , Virginia , socially conservative leaders are cheering Trump \u2019 s election and already moving to hold him accountable to the myriad campaign promises he made to Christian voters .\n\u201c Donald Trump is not the candidate pro-lifers would have chosen , and he understood that , and he did outreach , \u201d said Tom McClusky , vice president of government affairs at the anti-abortion rights group March for Life . McClusky , who has been critical of Trump in the past , continued , \u201c If he fulfills the promises he \u2019 s made , he could be the most pro-life president since Reagan . \u201d\nTrump , a thrice-married , onetime New York liberal who has said he has never asked God for forgiveness , was an uncomfortable fit for Christian leaders throughout much of the campaign . But he won over many of them with a pledge to appoint only Supreme Court justices who oppose abortion rights , and he solidified that support in September by releasing a detailed letter that spelled out four policy promises , all tied to curtailing abortion rights . He went on to win 81 percent of the evangelical vote , a higher percentage than George W. Bush , himself a born-again Christian , landed in 2004 .\nSome of Trump \u2019 s pledges , particularly the stipulations concerning Supreme Court appointments , go further than previous Republican nominees have made , and that has earned Trump a reservoir of goodwill with many evangelical leaders .
