President Michele Bachmann delivers on one of her campaign promises .\nDrivers enjoying the cheapest gasoline in years may not know this , but they have retired Congresswoman Michele Bachmann to thank for the low prices at the pump . During her awe-inspiring run for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 , Bachmann promised voters that if elected , she would bring them $ 2-a-gallon gasoline , and dang if she did not deliver on that campaign pledge this week .\nThe , how shall we say , not entirely reality-based , Bible-thumping former presidential candidate touted her accomplishment on Twitter this week , just to remind everyone .\nYou might wonder , did the fact that this miracle occurred under Democratic President Barack Obama cause any cognitive dissonance for Bachmann ? No , it did not . Because for that , you would have to have cognition to begin with .\n2 . Tea partier Steve King makes bizarre comparison of Louisiana lawmaker to Jesus .\nWhat would Jesus do , is a perennial question of the Christian faithful . Tea partying , rabid anti-immigrant congressman Steve King came up with a rather bizarre anwer to that question this week . King 's Jesus would give speeches to white supremacist groups , apparently . King was speaking about the controversy surrounding his Republican colleague Rep. Steve Scalise after reports emerged that he spoke at a conference with close links to former Ku Klux Klan leader and white pride-espousing politician , David Duke .\nIn an interview , King told the Washington Post that he and other conservative lawmakers plan to stand by Scalise , who is now the No . 3 Republican in the House of Representatives . They are apparently not bothered by the revelation that Scalise gave a speech at a white nationalists conference when he was a state lawmaker in 2002 . Scalise has claimed he did not really know who he was speaking to , which is odd .\nOdder still is that King then suggested that consorting with white nationalists is similar to something Jesus might have done .\n\u201c Jesus dined with tax collectors and sinners , \u201d King explained . \u201c It \u2019 s not the healthy who need a doctor , it \u2019 s the sick . Given that piece of scripture , and understanding that Scalise probably wasn \u2019 t staffed thoroughly , I could understand how something like this happened . But I know his heart , I \u2019 ve painted houses with him post-Katrina , and I know he is a good man . \u201d\n3 . Fox News offers absurd advice to women in honor of the New Year .\nWhat do men want ? It \u2019 s the age-old question . Oh , wait . No , it isn \u2019 t .\nFox & Friends offered some sage advice to the ladies on how to please their men on New Year \u2019 s day , so get out your notepad , gals .\nIt turns out that men like having their egos stroked , their meals cooked and their feet massaged , according to the crack experts on Fox .\n\u201c Ladies , listen up , \u201d host Clayton Morris said . \u201c Ladies , we \u2019 re talking to you . If you still don \u2019 t have a New Year \u2019 s resolution , then could this be it ? \u201d\nMorris recommends reading a new dating guide titled Single Man , Married Man , which was written by actual men , so women can get some \u201c honest advice on how to get a husband . \u201d\nCo-host Peter Doocy is always up for offering helpful romantic advice . \u201c No matter where a woman was in life , she should always be able to cater to her man \u2019 s needs . \u201d\nToken woman in the discussion Ainsley Earhardt struck a blow for feminism . \u201c Yeah , I do want to be a better wife . \u201d\nBut for Doocy , this was no joking matter .

More inanities followed and will surely follow again .\n4 . Conservative economist Art Laffer offers laughable analysis of why the economy is recovering .\nPity poor Fox News . Here the economy seems to finally be recovering somewhat , and the stock market has risen for the sixth straight year and that rascal of a president of ours has the audacity to crow about it .\nObama \u201c took a big bow , \u201d Fox 's Neil Cavuto whined on Friday .

The last thing any conservative brain would be able to entertain is that any sort of government stimulus might have helped , or heaven forfend , that quantitative easing was a good idea . The thought of more government spending ( except on the military , of course ) or eek , raising taxes on the uber-wealthy and corporations sends shivers up and down the conservative trickle-down economic spine .\nCavuto invited father-of-supply-side economics , Art Laffer , to help make sense of it , and well , frankly , he was not up to the job .
