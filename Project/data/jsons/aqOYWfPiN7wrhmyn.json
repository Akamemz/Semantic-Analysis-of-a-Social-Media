    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) The legal confrontation over Donald Trump 's immigration national emergency is becoming the most important test yet of his vision of an unfettered presidency immune to norms that check executive power .\nThe President hit back Tuesday after 16 states filed a lawsuit to stop his declaration aimed at redirecting funds already allocated by Congress for different purposes to build his border wall . The structure was the ideological anchor of his campaigns , rooted in claims that an `` invasion '' of undocumented migrants and criminals is swamping America .\n`` As I predicted , 16 states , led mostly by Open Border Democrats and the Radical Left , have filed a lawsuit in , of course , the 9th Circuit !

Now , thwarted by a new Democratic House and the arcane checks and balances of the Senate , Trump is claiming new executive power to reconcile his hardline vows on immigration .\nTrump 's declaration of a national emergency to fund his border wall represents one of the boldest grabs for presidential authority in generations and caps what is now a lengthening record of contempt for the regular political order .\nHis straining against norms is not confined to his duels with Congress .\nTrump 's verbal torching of the institutions of his own government like the Justice Department and the FBI appears to be becoming more intense as Robert Mueller 's special counsel probe grinds on .\nOne of Trump 's most enduring strategies is his willingness to stake out easily disprovable positions if they support his political goals -- another way that he is unencumbered by the constraints of many of his predecessors . In a new manifestation of his resistance to objective fact , he is now openly trashing the data collected by his own agencies when it does n't support his hunches on what he claims is an `` invasion '' of undocumented migrants .\nHe 's even insisting he 's already building his border wall -- reflecting the potential political price he may pay for failing to honor his top 2016 promise .\n`` I use many stats .
