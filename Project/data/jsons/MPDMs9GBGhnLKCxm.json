''\nJordan made a fiery case for allegations of improper spying on the Trump campaign by the Obama administration Justice Department that was widely touted amongst Capitol Hill Republicans .\n`` We know one fact . We know the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid for the dossier , '' he said .\n`` And it sure looks like the FBI was paying the author of that document and it sure looks like a major political party was working with the federal government to then turn an opposition research document \u2014 the equivalent of some National Enquirer story \u2014 into an intelligence document to take that to the FISA Court so they could then get a warrant to spy on President Trump \u2019 s campaign . ''\n`` That \u2019 s what it looks like and I \u2019 m asking you , in addition to all the things we know about James Comey in 2016 , doesn \u2019 t that warrant naming a second special counsel ?

But pressed further by Jordan \u2014 `` He 's not here today , Attorney General Sessions , and you are '' \u2014 Sessions appeared to throw cold water on the immediate need for a special counsel .\n`` I would say 'looks like ' is not enough basis to appoint a special counsel , '' he said sharply .\nHolding up pictures of Roy Moore and women who have come forward accusing him of sexual misconduct , Rep.

And taking those words at face value , somebody might accuse you of not being honest . And that \u2019 s what they \u2019 ve done to me , \u201d Sessions said after Issa claimed he doesn \u2019 t \u201c meet with Russians . \u201d\nIssa said this is a \u201c challenge \u201d members of the Foreign Affairs Committee face , saying they meet with a lot of diplomats and that he does not want to try to remember \u201c everyone and everything that was discussed in what I thought was a pro forma meeting . \u201d\nSessions said that he stands by his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee in June that he has no knowledge of contacts between the Trump campaign and Russians about interference in the election .\n\u201c I stand by this testimony at the Intelligence Committee : I have never met with or had any conversation with any Russians or any foreign officials concerning any type of foreign interference with the campaign or election in the United States . Further , I have no knowledge of any such conversations by anyone connected to the Trump campaign . \u201d\nSessions says he has not discussed Papadopolous with Mueller , anyone at FBI\nSessions said he has not had discussions with special counsel Robert Mueller or anyone at the FBI about his interactions with George Papadopoulos .\n\u201c I have not had any discussions with Mr. Mueller or his team or the FBI concerning any factors with regard [ to Papadopoulos ] , '' Sessions said in response to questioning from Rep. Jerrold Nadler ( D-N.Y. ) .\nWhen pressed , Sessions also said he does not remember discussing the issue with anyone at the Justice Department , the White House or in Congress \u2014 but left the door open that conversations he does not remember may have taken place .\n`` I do n't know if these conversations have come up at some time , but not to obtain information , '' Sessions said . `` With regards to your broad question , I do n't recall at this moment , sitting here , any such discussions .

''\nSessions characterized the Trump campaign as `` a form of chaos '' during his opening remarks .\nSessions made the comments when defending his past statements regarding the Trump campaign and Russia , suggesting that the slog of the campaign resulted in him not remembering certain meetings or conversations with other members of the campaign .\n\u201c It was a brilliant campaign , I think , in many ways . But it was a form of chaos every day from day one , '' Sessions said . \u201c We traveled sometimes to several places in one day , sleep was in short supply , and I was still a full-time senator with a very full schedule . \u201d\n\u201c My story has never changed , '' Sessions said . `` I have always told the truth . \u201d\nSessions was specifically addressing discussions he had with campaign foreign policy advisers Carter Page and George Papadopoulos , the latter of whom recently pleaded guilty for lying to FBI agents about his contacts with Russia-connected individuals .\nSessions : ' I do now recall ' talking to Trump campaign aide Papadopoulos\nSessions addressed reports that said he knew about the activities of former Trump campaign aides George Papadopoulos and Carter Page , who met with Russian officials during the 2016 election .\n\u201c Frankly , I had no recollection of this until I saw these news reports , \u201d he told the panel .\nHe added that the reports about the meeting last year with Papadopoulos jogged his memory , but he does not remember specific details besides warning him that he does not \u201c represent the campaign with the Russian government , or any other foreign government . \u201d\n\u201c I do now recall the March 2016 meeting at Trump Hotel that Mr. Papadopoulos attended , but I have no clear recollection of the details of what he said during that meeting , \u201d Sessions said in part .\n\u201c After reading his account , and to the best of my recollection , I believe that I wanted to make clear to him that he was not authorized to represent the campaign with the Russian government , or any other foreign government , for that matter . But I did not recall this event , which occurred 18 months before my testimony of a few weeks ago , and would gladly have reported it , \u201d he continued .\nSessions denied remembering the account of Carter Page in which Page described an interaction with him at an event at the Capitol Hill Club .\n\u201c As for Mr . Page , while I do not challenge his recollection , I have no memory of his presence at a dinner at the Capitol Hill Club or any passing conversation he may have had with me as he left , \u201d he added .\nPage 's testimony before the House Intelligence Committee revealed that he met with Russian officials during his trip to Moscow and that he told the campaign about the visit , which appeared to contradict past statements from campaign officials the statements made by Sessions .\nSessions denied remembering the account Carter Page gave to the House Intelligence panel in which he described telling Sessions about his Russia trip during an event at the Capitol Hill Club .\nSessions said that the Justice Department is exploring the possibility of a second special prosecutor .\n`` In response to letters from this committee and others , I have directed senior federal prosecutors to make recommendations as to whether any matters not currently under investigation should be opened , whether any matters currently under investigation require further resources , or whether any matters merit the appointment of a special counsel , '' the attorney general said in his opening statement .\nGoodlatte has urged the Justice Department to appoint an independent prosecutor to look into Clinton and the Obama administration .\nDespite criticism from Democrats who are concerned that the Justice Department is carrying out political vendettas on behalf of Trump , Sessions assured the committee that he will go forward `` without regard to politics , ideology , or bias . ''\nRanking member John Conyers ( D-Mich. ) used his opening statements to take aim at the letter sent by the Justice Department to Chairman Bob Goodlatte ( R-Va. ) suggesting that Sessions is considering appointing a new special counsel to investigate matters involving Hillary Clinton .\nConyers accused the issuing of the letter as having \u201c political motivations , \u201d and said that it was not sent to the committee minority , as is proper protocol .\n\u201c The assistant attorney general seems to leave the door open to appointing a new special counsel to cater to the president \u2019 s political needs , \u201d Conyers said of the letter . \u201c The fact that this letter was sent to the majority without the customary and appropriate notice to me indicates that the charge given to department officials to evaluate these issues has political motivations . \u201d\nThe letter , which was sent Monday , indicated that Sessions might appoint a new special counsel to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by the Clinton Foundation as well as the Obama-era Uranium One deal .\nConyers suggested that President Trump is using the Justice Department to punish his political opponents .\n\u201c Virtually every Clinton-related matter that President Trump complains about has been well-litigated , carefully examined and completely debunked , \u201d Conyers said .\nCommittee Chairman Bob Goodlatte ( R-Va. ) in his opening statement slammed former Attorney General Loretta Lynch for giving `` the least fulsome and least transparent testimony that I can recall in my time in Congress '' that was `` a disservice to the American people '' and `` beyond disappointing . ''\nSessions , he warned , will `` hear question after question today concerning your knowledge of or involvement with Russia , '' Goodlatte said , according to his prepared remarks .\n`` I suspect this theme will be a constant refrain from my friends on the other side of the aisle . ''\nHe expressed confidence that , had Sessions not recused himself from the federal investigation into Russian interference , he `` would have been impartial and fair in following the facts wherever they led . ''\nBut hinting at his own dissatisfaction with the former Alabama senator , Goodlatte also referenced a pair of requests that the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) name a second special counsel to investigate the the DOJ \u2019 s handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton 's email server .\n`` I have chosen , as chairman of this committee , to let special counsel Robert Mueller do his job , free from undue political influence , '' he said .\n`` At the same time , however , this committee will do its duty and conduct oversight of DOJ .

I am confident I did not,\u201d Sessions said.\n\nThe attorney general also said he did not recall any communications being forwarded to him from the low-level adviser, nor does he have \u201cspecific recollections\u201d of any conversations with campaign officials about Papadopoulos.\n\nSessions refuses to say whether White House has intervened in AT&T merger discussions\n\n1:10 p.m.\n\nSessions refused to say whether he has discussed the pending AT&T-Time Warner merger with anyone at the White House.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not able to comment on conversations or communications that Department of Justice top people have with top people at the White House,\u201d he said in response to a question from Rep.

CNN is a Time Warner subsidiary.\n\nEarlier in Tuesday's hearing, Sessions declined to comment on the merger discussions but threw doubt on the reports.\n\n\"I would just tell you that I would not be able to accept as accurate news reports that have come out on that,\" he said.\n\nCritics have raised the possibility that demands to sell CNN may have been part of President Trump's personal vendetta against the network. And Trump ally Rupert Murdoch has reportedly offered to buy CNN.\n\nSessions: Comey 'talked more than he should'\n\nSessions grilled on diversity\n\n12:55 p.m.\n\nIn response to questioning from Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.) about diversity, Sessions revealed that he does not have an African-American on his senior staff.\n\n\u201cI do not have a senior staff member who is African-American,\u201d Sessions said.\n\n\u201cFor a lot of people who objectively look from the back ... the question is whether we are going towards inclusion or diversity or whether we are going back,\u201d Richmond said.\n\nSessions underwent substantial questioning about diversity and efforts to crack down on crime, which Richmond suggested would work against minority populations.\n\nEarlier, Rep.

The Justice Department has said that the contacts were in Sessions\u2019s capacity as a senator.\n\n\u201cDid you have campaign communications with the Russians?\u201d asked Rep. Luis Guti\u00e9rrez (D-Ill.). \u201cBecause it appears you had had campaign communications with the Russians.\u201d\n\nSessions on Tuesday stressed the context of the question at the confirmation hearing and said that he answered it truthfully.\n\n\u201cMy focus was on responding to the concern that I, as a surrogate, was participating in a continuing series of meetings with intermediaries for the Russian government,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cI certainly didn\u2019t mean I had never met a Russian in the history of my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy response was, according to the way I heard the question, as honest as I could give it at the time,\u201d he said.\n\nSessions dodges questions on potential Trump pardons\n\n12:15 p.m.\n\nSessions angered Democrats when he repeatedly dodged questions about whether the president is able to pardon members of his campaign and administration who may be under scrutiny from the special counsel.\n\nRep.

Jim Jordan James (Jim) Daniel JordanGraham says Schiff should be a witness in Trump impeachment trial Democrats seize on new evidence in first public impeachment hearing House Republicans call impeachment hearing 'boring,' dismiss Taylor testimony as hearsay MORE (R-Ohio), Sessions pushed back on the immediate need for a second special counsel.\n\nIt would take \"a factual basis that meets the standard of a special counsel\" for the Justice Department to make such an appointment, he said.\n\n\"We will use the proper standards and that\u2019s the only thing I can tell you, Mr. Jordan,\" Sessions said. \"You can have your idea but sometimes we have to study what the facts are and to evaluate whether it meets the standards it requires.\"\n\nJordan made a fiery case for allegations of improper spying on the Trump campaign by the Obama administration Justice Department that was widely touted amongst Capitol Hill Republicans.\n\n\"We know one fact. We know the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid for the dossier,\" he said.\n\n\"And it sure looks like the FBI was paying the author of that document and it sure looks like a major political party was working with the federal government to then turn an opposition research document \u2014 the equivalent of some National Enquirer story \u2014 into an intelligence document to take that to the FISA Court so they could then get a warrant to spy on President Trump\u2019s campaign.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s what it looks like and I\u2019m asking you, in addition to all the things we know about James Comey in 2016, doesn\u2019t that warrant naming a second special counsel?\"\n\nSessions at first demurred, noting that Comey is no longer the director of the FBI and praising the current director, Chris Wray. But pressed further by Jordan \u2014 \"He's not here today, Attorney General Sessions, and you are\" \u2014 Sessions appeared to throw cold water on the immediate need for a special counsel.\n\n\"I would say 'looks like' is not enough basis to appoint a special counsel,\" he said sharply.\n\nSessions: 'I have no reason to doubt' Moore's accusers\n\n11:35 a.m.\n\nHolding up pictures of Roy Moore and women who have come forward accusing him of sexual misconduct, Rep.

And The New Yorker reported Monday night that Moore had been banned from a mall for harassing teenage girls.\n\nOn Monday, a fifth woman came forward to accuse Moore of sexual misconduct alleging that Moore had sexually assaulted her in the 1970s, when she was 16.\n\nThe attorney general said the Justice Department's ethics officials have advised him that he should stay out of any possible investigation regarding the special election given his close ties to many of the officials involved in the campaign.\n\nStill, he promised that his agency would perform its due diligence if it merits a federal investigation.\n\n\"We will do our duty,\" he said.\n\nSessions on need to remember every Russia meeting: 'That's what they've done to me'\n\n11:28 a.m.\n\nSessions jokingly warned GOP Rep.

And taking those words at face value, somebody might accuse you of not being honest. And that\u2019s what they\u2019ve done to me,\u201d Sessions said after Issa claimed he doesn\u2019t \u201cmeet with Russians.\u201d\n\nIssa said this is a \u201cchallenge\u201d members of the Foreign Affairs Committee face, saying they meet with a lot of diplomats and that he does not want to try to remember \u201ceveryone and everything that was discussed in what I thought was a pro forma meeting.\u201d\n\nSessions stands by testimony to Senate lawmakers in June\n\n11:27 a.m.\n\nSessions said that he stands by his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee in June that he has no knowledge of contacts between the Trump campaign and Russians about interference in the election.\n\n\u201cI stand by this testimony at the Intelligence Committee: I have never met with or had any conversation with any Russians or any foreign officials concerning any type of foreign interference with the campaign or election in the United States. Further, I have no knowledge of any such conversations by anyone connected to the Trump campaign.\u201d\n\nSessions says he has not discussed Papadopolous with Mueller, anyone at FBI\n\n11:15 a.m.\n\nSessions said he has not had discussions with special counsel Robert Mueller or anyone at the FBI about his interactions with George Papadopoulos.\n\n\u201cI have not had any discussions with Mr. Mueller or his team or the FBI concerning any factors with regard [to Papadopoulos],\" Sessions said in response to questioning from Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.).\n\nWhen pressed, Sessions also said he does not remember discussing the issue with anyone at the Justice Department, the White House or in Congress \u2014 but left the door open that conversations he does not remember may have taken place.\n\n\"I don't know if these conversations have come up at some time, but not to obtain information,\" Sessions said. \"With regards to your broad question, I don't recall at this moment, sitting here, any such discussions.\"\n\nSessions also said he did not remember communicating with anyone in the campaign about the Papadopoulos issue.\n\nSessions dodges on Clinton probe recusal\n\n\n\n10:52 a.m.\n\nSessions declined to answer questions from Rep.

But it was a form of chaos every day from day one,\" Sessions said. \u201cWe traveled sometimes to several places in one day, sleep was in short supply, and I was still a full-time senator with a very full schedule.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy story has never changed,\" Sessions said. \"I have always told the truth.\u201d\n\nSessions was specifically addressing discussions he had with campaign foreign policy advisers Carter Page and George Papadopoulos, the latter of whom recently pleaded guilty for lying to FBI agents about his contacts with Russia-connected individuals.\n\nSessions: 'I do now recall' talking to Trump campaign aide Papadopoulos\n\n10:45 a.m.\n\nSessions addressed reports that said he knew about the activities of former Trump campaign aides George Papadopoulos and Carter Page, who met with Russian officials during the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cFrankly, I had no recollection of this until I saw these news reports,\u201d he told the panel.\n\nHe added that the reports about the meeting last year with Papadopoulos jogged his memory, but he does not remember specific details besides warning him that he does not \u201crepresent the campaign with the Russian government, or any other foreign government.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do now recall the March 2016 meeting at Trump Hotel that Mr. Papadopoulos attended, but I have no clear recollection of the details of what he said during that meeting,\u201d Sessions said in part.\n\n\u201cAfter reading his account, and to the best of my recollection, I believe that I wanted to make clear to him that he was not authorized to represent the campaign with the Russian government, or any other foreign government, for that matter. But I did not recall this event, which occurred 18 months before my testimony of a few weeks ago, and would gladly have reported it,\u201d he continued.\n\nSessions denied remembering the account of Carter Page in which Page described an interaction with him at an event at the Capitol Hill Club.\n\n\u201cAs for Mr. Page, while I do not challenge his recollection, I have no memory of his presence at a dinner at the Capitol Hill Club or any passing conversation he may have had with me as he left,\u201d he added.\n\nPage's testimony before the House Intelligence Committee revealed that he met with Russian officials during his trip to Moscow and that he told the campaign about the visit, which appeared to contradict past statements from campaign officials the statements made by Sessions.\n\nSessions denied remembering the account Carter Page gave to the House Intelligence panel in which he described telling Sessions about his Russia trip during an event at the Capitol Hill Club.\n\nSessions awaiting recommendations on possible second special counsel\n\n10:42 a.m.\n\nSessions said that the Justice Department is exploring the possibility of a second special prosecutor.\n\n\"In response to letters from this committee and others, I have directed senior federal prosecutors to make recommendations as to whether any matters not currently under investigation should be opened, whether any matters currently under investigation require further resources, or whether any matters merit the appointment of a special counsel,\" the attorney general said in his opening statement.\n\nGoodlatte has urged the Justice Department to appoint an independent prosecutor to look into Clinton and the Obama administration.\n\nDespite criticism from Democrats who are concerned that the Justice Department is carrying out political vendettas on behalf of Trump, Sessions assured the committee that he will go forward \"without regard to politics, ideology, or bias.\"\n\nRanking member slams \u2018political motivations\u2019 behind new DOJ letter\n\n10:30 a.m.\n\nRanking member John Conyers (D-Mich.) used his opening statements to take aim at the letter sent by the Justice Department to Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) suggesting that Sessions is considering appointing a new special counsel to investigate matters involving Hillary Clinton.\n\nConyers accused the issuing of the letter as having \u201cpolitical motivations,\u201d and said that it was not sent to the committee minority, as is proper protocol.\n\n\u201cThe assistant attorney general seems to leave the door open to appointing a new special counsel to cater to the president\u2019s political needs,\u201d Conyers said of the letter. \u201cThe fact that this letter was sent to the majority without the customary and appropriate notice to me indicates that the charge given to department officials to evaluate these issues has political motivations.\u201d\n\nThe letter, which was sent Monday, indicated that Sessions might appoint a new special counsel to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by the Clinton Foundation as well as the Obama-era Uranium One deal.\n\nConyers suggested that President Trump is using the Justice Department to punish his political opponents.\n\n\u201cVirtually every Clinton-related matter that President Trump complains about has been well-litigated, carefully examined and completely debunked,\u201d Conyers said.\n\nGoodlatte slams Obama DOJ, warns Sessions\n\n9:57 a.m.\n\nCommittee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) in his opening statement slammed former Attorney General Loretta Lynch for giving \"the least fulsome and least transparent testimony that I can recall in my time in Congress\" that was \"a disservice to the American people\" and \"beyond disappointing.\"\n\nSessions, he warned, will \"hear question after question today concerning your knowledge of or involvement with Russia,\" Goodlatte said, according to his prepared remarks.\n\n\"I suspect this theme will be a constant refrain from my friends on the other side of the aisle.\"\n\nHe expressed confidence that, had Sessions not recused himself from the federal investigation into Russian interference, he \"would have been impartial and fair in following the facts wherever they led.\"\n\nBut hinting at his own dissatisfaction with the former Alabama senator, Goodlatte also referenced a pair of requests that the Department of Justice (DOJ) name a second special counsel to investigate the the DOJ\u2019s handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server.\n\n\"I have chosen, as chairman of this committee, to let special counsel Robert Mueller do his job, free from undue political influence,\" he said.\n\n\"At the same time, however, this committee will do its duty and conduct oversight of DOJ.\"",
