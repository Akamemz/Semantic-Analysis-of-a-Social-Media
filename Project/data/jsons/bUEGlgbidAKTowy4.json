And almost every assumption about presidential campaigns since the birth of modern politics in 1960, with the first televised debate and widespread use of TV advertising, has been debunked. Our political catechism has been upended. Consider the following:\n\n1. Money trumps all (pun intended).\n\nWhen the Supreme Court ruled in the 2010 Citizens United case that corporations were people and therefore could spend unlimited amounts of money \u2013 without disclosure, in some instances \u2013 on political campaigns, Democrats and other critics warned that democracy was now for sale and that the candidate who raised the most money would invariably prevail over less well-funded contenders. Enter Jeb Bush, the Republican Party\u2019s \u201cinevitable\u201d nominee, who raised over $130 million for his campaign and Super Pac even before he formally declared. Eight months later, exit Jeb!, the \u201clow-energy\u201d candidate who, having spent the vast majority of the money he had raised, quit the race, dragging his exclamation point behind him. Donald Trump, by contrast, may be wealthy \u2013 just how rich remains in dispute \u2013 but he has spent less overall than any other candidate and, because of the nonstop coverage his slurs and antics have received, virtually nothing on TV advertising.\n\n2. Organization is everything.\n\nTed Cruz was supposed to win all the early GOP contests because of his heavy investment in his \u201cground game.\u201d But, with the exception of Iowa \u2013 which he first visited in 2008, only months after being elected a first-term senator from Texas \u2013 organization, like money, has meant little this year. Cruz won Iowa thanks to a large evangelical turnout after Trump skipped what turned out to be a critical debate days before the nation\u2019s first caucus, but he has steadily faded ever since.

While Trump has repeatedly flown to primary states in his private jet, he rarely spends a night outside his baronial residence on Fifth Avenue.\n\n3. Endorsements matter.\n\nApparently not this year. Almost no establishment politician endorsed Trump during the first two primaries. The only other celebrity politician who rallied to Trump\u2019s side was Sarah Palin, whose rambling, incoherent 45-minute endorsement prior to the Iowa caucus, if anything, may have cost him votes there. Marco Rubio, the candidate who has garnered the most endorsements, has yet to win a primary and is unlikely to do so, despite his growing support from a still reeling Republican \u201cestablishment.\u201d\n\n4. You can\u2019t run against the media.\n\nTrump has mocked this political platitude, repeatedly. If anything, one of the bumptious billionaire\u2019s most reliable applause lines is his frequent declaration that the media are \u201cterrible,\u201d \u201camong the most dishonest groups of people\u201d he\u2019s ever met. Apparently his rivals have gotten the message. During the debate in Houston last Thursday, every candidate except John Kasich, who is running a poor fifth except in his home state of Ohio, attacked the press.\n\n5. A candidate can\u2019t prevail with high negatives.\n\nQuite the contrary. In 2016, given America\u2019s deep political polarization, no candidate seems able to win without high negatives. The nation\u2019s bitter frustration seems to require candidates to make increasingly stark, even extreme, appeals. The GOP field has no shortage of candidates with high positive ratings, especially Ben Carson and Marco Rubio, neither of whom has carried a single state primary or caucus. On the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders has far higher favorability ratings than Hillary Clinton, who in poll after poll is widely viewed by potential voters of most ages, ethnicities and genders as \u201cuntrustworthy\u201d and perhaps even \u201cdishonest.\u201d Yet Clinton got 73.5 percent of the Democratic vote in South Carolina on Saturday.\n\nMany Trump critics continue to assert that he will ultimately stumble, because no candidate can win his party\u2019s nomination or be elected to the nation\u2019s highest office without substantial political experience. While the 2008 election of a junior senator from Illinois whose resume featured only a brief stint as a community organizer began to challenge that political bromide, the crucial primaries on March 1 and March 15 will be the ultimate referee.\n\nGiven the pundits\u2019 predictive record so far, a degree of humility is in order.
