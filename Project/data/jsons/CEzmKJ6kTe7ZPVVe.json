The state Department of Environment and Natural Resources ordered Duke to stop the flow of contaminated water coming out a pipe that runs under a huge coal ash dump at its Eden power plant . A nearby pipe at the same dump collapsed without warning two weeks ago , coating the bottom of the Dan River with toxic ash as far as 70 miles downstream . State regulators expressed concern five days ago that the second pipe could fail , triggering a new spill . The water coming out of that pipe contains poisonous arsenic at 14 times the level considered safe for human contact , according to test results released by the state on Tuesday .
