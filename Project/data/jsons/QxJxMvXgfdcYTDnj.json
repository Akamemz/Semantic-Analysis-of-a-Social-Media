    "content": "President Trump wants you , and everyone else in America , to believe that the US-Mexico border isn \u2019 t just in trouble but in crisis .\nThe fundamental premise of the government shutdown is that the US-Mexico border is so dangerous to human life that it is worth shutting down whole swaths of the federal government , forcing 800,000 federal employees to miss paychecks , in order to address it .\nAnd , of course , the way to solve the crisis , Trump argues ( in a primetime speech on Tuesday , and , as expected , during a trip to the border later this week ) is to give the federal government $ 5.7 billion to build about 250 more miles of physical barriers .\nMost of Trump \u2019 s claims about the border are fever-dream fantasies that people who actually live there don \u2019 t recognize . But some of them have grains of truth : In one respect \u2014 the number of children and families entering the US \u2014 what we \u2019 re seeing is genuinely unprecedented .\nStill , a shutdown-worthy crisis , much less a \u201c national emergency , \u201d is a rare and dire thing . A crisis may require immediate attention and a national debate to determine the best course of action , but it may not require that everything else grind to a halt . And not everything that is going wrong , or less than perfectly , is a crisis .\nThis is the most important thing to remember about the US-Mexico border and the Trump administration \u2019 s claims about it . Even if you believe that no one should come to the US without papers , or believe that too many asylum seekers are released into the country \u2014 or , conversely , if you believe the Trump administration \u2019 s treatment of children and families crossing the border is a national outrage \u2014 that isn \u2019 t the same as believing it \u2019 s a crisis in the way the Trump administration means .\nTo make that judgment , don \u2019 t start with what Trump says about the border . Start with what \u2019 s true .\n1 ) The border panic has very little to do with what people who live on the border actually see\nIt \u2019 s certainly true that some Americans ( though probably not tens of millions ) are so worried about gang members and criminals coming over the border to kill them that they are willing to shut down the government over it . But the people who actually live on the border aren \u2019 t asking for any of this .\nBecause Trump has worked so tirelessly to reenforce the theme that Republicans will protect you from criminal immigrants while Democrats will abandon you to them , the easiest way to gauge whether border residents agree is to look at election results .\nThe 2018 midterm elections \u2014 when Trump , ignoring the advice of other Republicans , hammered relentlessly on border security in the last weeks of the campaign \u2014 resulted in Republicans losing two seats along the US-Mexico border , one in Arizona and one in New Mexico . In the current Congress , the only Republican representing a district along the border is Texas Rep. Will Hurd , an outspoken moderate on immigration who says his opposition to a border wall is the reason he won reelection .\nIn fact , as of 2017 ( according to the Pew Research Center ) , people who lived less than 350 miles from the border were the least likely to support Trump \u2019 s wall . In other words , the people supposedly on the front lines of what Trump calls a crisis are those least inclined to support the proposed solution to it .\nPeople who live along the border are used to politicians \u2014 at both the local and state level \u2014 fearmongering about their hometowns . One Texas sheriff spoke out in 2014 to discourage politicians in his state government from hyping the border threat too much \u2014 they appreciated the extra money but worried it would hurt their tourism industry . \u201c A lot of tourists will call up to my office and say , \u2018 Is it safe out there ? \u2019 \u201d the sheriff , Ronny Dodson , told Chris Hooks at the time . \u201c We \u2019 ll ask where they \u2019 re coming from . They \u2019 ll say \u2018 Houston. \u2019 We \u2019 ll say , hurry up and get out of there ! It \u2019 s safer here than where you \u2019 re coming from . \u201d\nThe political rhetoric is feeding real fear \u2014 among people who live far from the border . But people who live closer to it simply don \u2019 t identify with that . That \u2019 s an important perspective to keep in mind in regards to not only Trump \u2019 s claims about the lawlessness of the border , but also how the American people see this as a crisis someone needs to step in to solve .\n2 ) The US has more than 600 miles of border barriers \u2014 and 20-plus years of uninterrupted buildup\nThe US has been increasing security on its southern border since the 1990s . ( Trump \u2019 s attorney general nominee William Barr engaged in some of this buildup the last time he was AG , under George H.W . Bush . )\nBorder Patrol has expanded radically . Wave after wave of surveillance projects have been thrown at the border in the hopes of spotting every person or thing coming over . And across 650 miles of the border , even before Trump got into office , there was some form of physical barrier \u2014 from Vietnam-surplus landing mats to the steel bollards , or \u201c slats , \u201d Trump now favors for his wall as well .\nPhysical border barriers first came into use in urban areas , like San Diego and El Paso , where it was hard for Border Patrol agents to spot and catch people who crossed without papers . They \u2019 ve since expanded to other areas where large numbers of people might cross in an effort to deter easy crossings .\nSome activists and progressives refer to the buildup at the border as a \u201c militarization , \u201d and there \u2019 s something to that \u2014 living on the border means being subject to roadside checkpoints , surveillance , and ( sometimes ) a fence through your backyard . Before Trump , both Democrats and Republicans were eager to increase border security at the drop of a hat . The effect ( along with the related phenomena of violence on the Mexican side of the border ) has been a transformation of border communities from cross-border exchanges to citadels .\nWhen he was running for president , Trump had a ready rebuttal to this : He wasn \u2019 t just talking about a fence , but a real , honest-to-goodness wall . But after two years of actually being president , and having an administration that knows what \u2019 s feasible to construct and what Border Patrol agents actually prefer , his administration is exclusively building barriers out of steel bollards \u2014 the construction style that was the gold standard for barrier construction even before Trump .\nTrump can continue to call it a \u201c steel wall , \u201d but what his administration is really proposing is updating and expanding an existing system of barriers , not creating a thing that hasn \u2019 t been there before .\n3 ) In historical context , illegal border crossings are way down\nThe federal government doesn \u2019 t try to estimate how many people successfully cross into the US without papers , undetected . What it does \u2014 and has done for more than half a century \u2014 is use the number of migrants its agents catch trying to enter the US between ports of entry as a proxy for how many , overall , must be trying to get through .\nBy that measure , the security of the US-Mexico border in fiscal year 2018 ( which ended on September 30 of last year ) was comparable to the early 1970s .\nUnauthorized migration to the US was already on the decline before the Great Recession \u2014 probably in part because the US government started formally deporting people instead of simply turning them back , making it harder for someone to try to enter the US several times in a single year . But the recession all but killed it .\nThe Trump administration doesn \u2019 t present things that way . It talks about patterns of the past decade ( where crossings have been roughly comparable ) or simply compares 2017 to 2018 . That makes 2018 seem like an alarming increase . But the reality is that 2017 was an abnormally slow year for border crossings \u2014 in part , researchers suspect , because the fear of a Trump presidency delayed some people from taking the trip .\nSince numbers started ticking back up in early 2018 , the Trump administration has been in a near-constant state of panic over the border . It \u2019 s the result of a bad baseline \u2014 and unreasonable expectations .\n4 ) We are seeing unprecedented numbers of families and children coming to the US without papers\nJust as important as the change in how many people are crossing into the US between ports of entry is a change in who is doing it .\nOver the past several years , adults traveling with children \u2014 and children traveling alone \u2014 have made up an ever-increasing share of people apprehended at the border . ( Often , \u201c apprehended \u201d means the migrants seek out a Border Patrol agent and turn themselves in to ask for asylum . )\nThe government has only been keeping separate statistics on apprehensions of families and children since 2012 . The numbers we \u2019 ve seen in the past few months are a record for that ( brief ) period \u2014 even outpacing the peak of the \u201c border crisis \u201d in June 2014 .\nAnd while it might be hard to imagine that more families and children are coming to the US now than were in 2000 \u2014 when overall apprehensions were four times greater \u2014 experts say that \u2019 s exactly what \u2019 s happened . A 2017 report from the government \u2019 s Office of Immigration Statistics estimated that children and families made up less than 2 percent of border crossers during the 2003-2008 period . For the past few months , they \u2019 ve made up more than half of all apprehensions .\nThere are multiple reasons for this . The collapse of the unauthorized labor influx incentivized smugglers to find new markets . And they had some ready new markets in the people of the Northern Triangle of Central America ( El Salvador , Guatemala , and Honduras ) , who were desperate to leave gang violence and poverty . Meanwhile , adults who had already settled in the US wanted to bring the children of their family to live with them .\nThe result isn \u2019 t just that more of the people who are coming are children and families , but that , by the numbers , more children and families are coming than ever before . More than 150,000 children or family members were apprehended by Border Patrol in fiscal year 2018 . That \u2019 s nearly 10 percent of the overall apprehensions in 2000 \u2014 and we have no reason to believe that children and families actually made up 10 percent of what used to be a migration of single adults .\n5 ) The Trump administration is tragically unequipped to deal with the families and children coming in now\nThe US \u2019 s border infrastructure isn \u2019 t designed to take care of families or children . But that \u2019 s the role it \u2019 s been forced into . And the results have been tragic .\nCustoms and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan told the Senate Judiciary Committee in December that \u201c the infrastructure is not compatible with the reality \u201d of who is getting apprehended \u2014 essentially admitting that his agency was ill-equipped to take care of the people currently entering the US .\nBorder Patrol doesn \u2019 t even have the standards for detention conditions that Immigration and Customs Enforcement has \u2014 because Border Patrol isn \u2019 t supposed to be detaining anyone for any meaningful amount of time . The problem , of course , is that the times families are being held by Border Patrol for days on end are the times when the rest of the system is already overloaded and in crisis .\nBefore December 2018 , it had been a decade since any child had died in the custody of Border Patrol ( or its partner division , the Customs and Border Protection Office of Field Operations , which deals with ports of entry ) . In December 2018 , two children did .\nThe death of Jakelin Caal Maquin on December 8 has raised questions about Border Patrol \u2019 s responsiveness to medical needs and its capacity to deal with medical emergencies in remote areas of the border . The death of Felipe Alonzo-Gomez on Christmas Day has raised separate questions : about why a child was held in Border Patrol custody for six days before ICE was even asked to find a spot for him and his father , and about why he was shuffled between four facilities \u2014 including being taken from the hospital to a cramped highway checkpoint .\nWhen it can no longer hold so many families in custody , the federal government has sometimes turned them out en masse without warning \u2014 as ICE did to several hundred families in El Paso before Christmas \u2014 leaving them in an unfamiliar country with a tight deadline to make it to their next immigration check-in .\nAt ports of entry , where it is legal to cross without papers if you wish to seek asylum in the US , some officials have told families to wait , or turned them away to come back later , in a semi-official policy known as \u201c metering. \u201d Metering has increased the incentive for families to cross between ports of entry illegally .\nDemocrats and progressives accuse the Trump administration of boxing itself into this resource crunch by detaining massive numbers of people ( including families ) to begin with , and argue that Border Patrol agents would be less overwhelmed if there were more capacity and willingness to process asylum seekers legally at ports . The administration , for its part , argues it \u2019 s doing everything it can and simply doesn \u2019 t have the resources it needs to provide humane care .\n6 ) The \u201c problem \u201d of asylum seekers isn \u2019 t something that a wall can fix\nIt might be fair to call the current situation at the border a \u201c humanitarian crisis. \u201d But it isn \u2019 t why Trump shut down the government . And it isn \u2019 t something a wall can fix .\nThe point of walls is to prevent people from crossing into the US undetected . That \u2019 s not what most of the families and children who are crossing are doing . They \u2019 re turning themselves in to the nearest border agent they see on the US side .\nNot all of them , but a large share , are seeking asylum \u2014 seeking to live legally in the US . That \u2019 s something they have a legal right to do even if they crossed illegally \u2014 and it \u2019 s something they could do at a port of entry even if there were a wall across the entire border .\nThe Trump administration \u2019 s specific problem with the influx of asylum seekers isn \u2019 t that it isn \u2019 t catching them \u2014 it \u2019 s that it can \u2019 t quickly deport them , and can \u2019 t detain them for the entire time until they are deported , because of extra legal protections for asylum seekers as well as for children and families . ( The administration calls these \u201c loopholes \u201d that create a policy of \u201c catch and release . \u201d )\nTo Trump and his administration , \u201c catch and release \u201d is a crisis \u2014 because it means that large numbers of people are released into the US on their own recognizance , many of whom don \u2019 t make it all the way through the asylum process or ultimately have their asylum claims denied .\nThe administration has long agitated to overhaul the law to close these \u201c loopholes , \u201d over strident objection from Democrats . Whether \u201c catch and release \u201d is a crisis is a matter of discussion . Whether a wall would address it is not .\n7 ) There is no evidence of a terrorist crisis at the border\nThe Trump administration \u2019 s efforts to claim that thousands of terrorists or potential terrorists have tried to cross into the US have been roundly mocked and debunked . NBC found that a total of six known or suspected terrorists were caught trying to come to the US in the first six months of 2018 .\nTo a certain extent , the administration is ( either carelessly or mendaciously ) conflating \u201c known or suspected terrorists \u201d with \u201c special interest aliens \u201d \u2014 migrants who automatically get additional screening because of factors they might have in common with terrorists . One of those factors is \u201c travel patterns \u201d \u2014 in other words , being a \u201c special interest alien \u201d might just mean that one visited for , or is from , a country that the US considers friendly to terrorism . Even the Trump administration , which has banned nationals of several countries for similar reasons , isn \u2019 t claiming that everyone affected by the \u201c travel ban \u201d is a terrorist .\nBut the debunking of the administration \u2019 s specific numbers about terrorism at the border kind of misses a bigger point : that this whole conversation is about the typical vetting and screening process people undergo to enter the United States , and the number of people \u201c caught \u201d are the ones successfully identified .\nThere is no reason to assume that catching more potential \u201c terrorists \u201d means that more of them are slipping through . To the contrary , improving a vetting system should mean that ( in theory ) more people are being caught because fewer are slipping through .\nOn a very broad scale , it is true that perfect antiterrorism defense would require literally zero unauthorized border crossings . But that \u2019 s not the same as arguing that there is an imminent terrorist threat . And the way the administration talks about terrorism just isn \u2019 t related to the things it wants to do .\n8 ) The border drug issue is about insufficient screening at ports\nSimilarly , Trump likes to characterize the border as a haven for drug smuggling , going on flights of fancy about drones or \u201c sacks of drugs \u201d hitting agents on the head .\nIt \u2019 s true that a lot of drugs consumed in the US come in via the border with Mexico . But the majority of them , consistently , come into the US at ports of entry \u2014 official border crossings . A wall would have no impact .\nThe Trump administration is actually working to address this problem , by scanning more vehicles at ports . In fact , its official offer to Congress to end the shutdown included $ 675 million for vehicle-scanning technology \u2014 though Vice President Pence said the request came from Democrats in Congress .\nBuilding a wall probably wouldn \u2019 t cause more drugs to flow into the US . But that doesn \u2019 t mean building one is a national imperative .\n9 ) Walls work \u2014 to direct people to cross somewhere else along the border\nThe Trump administration likes to cite statistics from areas where barriers have already been built , followed by a drop in apprehensions of unauthorized immigrants .\nThat \u2019 s how it \u2019 s supposed to work \u2014 because the wall was designed to get them to go somewhere else .\nThe purpose of physical barriers is what border agents call \u201c funneling \u201d \u2014 pushing people to cross where they can be more easily apprehended by Border Patrol .\nThat funneling can be helpful to ensure that Border Patrol agents catch as many people as possible , or to focus them on tracking more sophisticated criminal efforts .\nBut that doesn \u2019 t mean that you can reduce the overall number of people coming into the US by building as much wall as possible .\nThere is some evidence that previous border security buildups have succeeded in deterring some migrants from coming to the US over the past decade ( though some scholars argue that the Great Recession played a bigger role ) . There \u2019 s even more evidence that it \u2019 s deterred people who were caught once from trying to cross a second time .\nBut it \u2019 s not clear whether that \u2019 s an indication that the US could be even more effective with even more enforcement , or that the government has already picked the low-hanging fruit .\nThe people still coming to the US without papers are , increasingly , what are sometimes referred to as \u201c non-impactables \u201d \u2014 people who can \u2019 t be affected by the harshness of the typical immigration enforcement regime . Children and families from Central America are coming despite a journey that is often dangerous , and coming despite the possibility that they might not make it . It \u2019 s hard to deter people who are already so desperate .",

They\u2019ll say \u2018Houston.\u2019 We\u2019ll say, hurry up and get out of there! It\u2019s safer here than where you\u2019re coming from.\u201d\n\nThe political rhetoric is feeding real fear \u2014 among people who live far from the border.

And the results have been tragic.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan told the Senate Judiciary Committee in December that \u201cthe infrastructure is not compatible with the reality\u201d of who is getting apprehended \u2014 essentially admitting that his agency was ill-equipped to take care of the people currently entering the US.\n\nBorder Patrol doesn\u2019t even have the standards for detention conditions that Immigration and Customs Enforcement has \u2014 because Border Patrol isn\u2019t supposed to be detaining anyone for any meaningful amount of time. The problem, of course, is that the times families are being held by Border Patrol for days on end are the times when the rest of the system is already overloaded and in crisis.\n\nBefore December 2018, it had been a decade since any child had died in the custody of Border Patrol (or its partner division, the Customs and Border Protection Office of Field Operations, which deals with ports of entry). In December 2018, two children did.\n\nThe death of Jakelin Caal Maquin on December 8 has raised questions about Border Patrol\u2019s responsiveness to medical needs and its capacity to deal with medical emergencies in remote areas of the border. The death of Felipe Alonzo-Gomez on Christmas Day has raised separate questions: about why a child was held in Border Patrol custody for six days before ICE was even asked to find a spot for him and his father, and about why he was shuffled between four facilities \u2014 including being taken from the hospital to a cramped highway checkpoint.\n\nWhen it can no longer hold so many families in custody, the federal government has sometimes turned them out en masse without warning \u2014 as ICE did to several hundred families in El Paso before Christmas \u2014 leaving them in an unfamiliar country with a tight deadline to make it to their next immigration check-in.\n\nAt ports of entry, where it is legal to cross without papers if you wish to seek asylum in the US, some officials have told families to wait, or turned them away to come back later, in a semi-official policy known as \u201cmetering.\u201d Metering has increased the incentive for families to cross between ports of entry illegally.\n\nDemocrats and progressives accuse the Trump administration of boxing itself into this resource crunch by detaining massive numbers of people (including families) to begin with, and argue that Border Patrol agents would be less overwhelmed if there were more capacity and willingness to process asylum seekers legally at ports. The administration, for its part, argues it\u2019s doing everything it can and simply doesn\u2019t have the resources it needs to provide humane care.\n\n6) The \u201cproblem\u201d of asylum seekers isn\u2019t something that a wall can fix\n\nIt might be fair to call the current situation at the border a \u201chumanitarian crisis.\u201d But it isn\u2019t why Trump shut down the government. And it isn\u2019t something a wall can fix.\n\nThe point of walls is to prevent people from crossing into the US undetected. That\u2019s not what most of the families and children who are crossing are doing. They\u2019re turning themselves in to the nearest border agent they see on the US side.\n\nNot all of them, but a large share, are seeking asylum \u2014 seeking to live legally in the US. That\u2019s something they have a legal right to do even if they crossed illegally \u2014 and it\u2019s something they could do at a port of entry even if there were a wall across the entire border.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s specific problem with the influx of asylum seekers isn\u2019t that it isn\u2019t catching them \u2014 it\u2019s that it can\u2019t quickly deport them, and can\u2019t detain them for the entire time until they are deported, because of extra legal protections for asylum seekers as well as for children and families. (The administration calls these \u201cloopholes\u201d that create a policy of \u201ccatch and release.\u201d)\n\nTo Trump and his administration, \u201ccatch and release\u201d is a crisis \u2014 because it means that large numbers of people are released into the US on their own recognizance, many of whom don\u2019t make it all the way through the asylum process or ultimately have their asylum claims denied.\n\nThe administration has long agitated to overhaul the law to close these \u201cloopholes,\u201d over strident objection from Democrats. Whether \u201ccatch and release\u201d is a crisis is a matter of discussion. Whether a wall would address it is not.\n\n7) There is no evidence of a terrorist crisis at the border\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s efforts to claim that thousands of terrorists or potential terrorists have tried to cross into the US have been roundly mocked and debunked. NBC found that a total of six known or suspected terrorists were caught trying to come to the US in the first six months of 2018.\n\nTo a certain extent, the administration is (either carelessly or mendaciously) conflating \u201cknown or suspected terrorists\u201d with \u201cspecial interest aliens\u201d \u2014 migrants who automatically get additional screening because of factors they might have in common with terrorists. One of those factors is \u201ctravel patterns\u201d \u2014 in other words, being a \u201cspecial interest alien\u201d might just mean that one visited for, or is from, a country that the US considers friendly to terrorism. Even the Trump administration, which has banned nationals of several countries for similar reasons, isn\u2019t claiming that everyone affected by the \u201ctravel ban\u201d is a terrorist.\n\nBut the debunking of the administration\u2019s specific numbers about terrorism at the border kind of misses a bigger point: that this whole conversation is about the typical vetting and screening process people undergo to enter the United States, and the number of people \u201ccaught\u201d are the ones successfully identified.\n\nThere is no reason to assume that catching more potential \u201cterrorists\u201d means that more of them are slipping through. To the contrary, improving a vetting system should mean that (in theory) more people are being caught because fewer are slipping through.\n\nOn a very broad scale, it is true that perfect antiterrorism defense would require literally zero unauthorized border crossings. But that\u2019s not the same as arguing that there is an imminent terrorist threat. And the way the administration talks about terrorism just isn\u2019t related to the things it wants to do.\n\n8) The border drug issue is about insufficient screening at ports\n\nSimilarly, Trump likes to characterize the border as a haven for drug smuggling, going on flights of fancy about drones or \u201csacks of drugs\u201d hitting agents on the head.\n\nIt\u2019s true that a lot of drugs consumed in the US come in via the border with Mexico. But the majority of them, consistently, come into the US at ports of entry \u2014 official border crossings. A wall would have no impact.\n\nThe Trump administration is actually working to address this problem, by scanning more vehicles at ports. In fact, its official offer to Congress to end the shutdown included $675 million for vehicle-scanning technology \u2014 though Vice President Pence said the request came from Democrats in Congress.\n\nBuilding a wall probably wouldn\u2019t cause more drugs to flow into the US. But that doesn\u2019t mean building one is a national imperative.\n\n9) Walls work \u2014 to direct people to cross somewhere else along the border\n\nThe Trump administration likes to cite statistics from areas where barriers have already been built, followed by a drop in apprehensions of unauthorized immigrants.\n\nThat\u2019s how it\u2019s supposed to work \u2014 because the wall was designed to get them to go somewhere else.\n\nThe purpose of physical barriers is what border agents call \u201cfunneling\u201d \u2014 pushing people to cross where they can be more easily apprehended by Border Patrol.\n\nThat funneling can be helpful to ensure that Border Patrol agents catch as many people as possible, or to focus them on tracking more sophisticated criminal efforts.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that you can reduce the overall number of people coming into the US by building as much wall as possible.\n\nThere is some evidence that previous border security buildups have succeeded in deterring some migrants from coming to the US over the past decade (though some scholars argue that the Great Recession played a bigger role). There\u2019s even more evidence that it\u2019s deterred people who were caught once from trying to cross a second time.\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear whether that\u2019s an indication that the US could be even more effective with even more enforcement, or that the government has already picked the low-hanging fruit.\n\nThe people still coming to the US without papers are, increasingly, what are sometimes referred to as \u201cnon-impactables\u201d \u2014 people who can\u2019t be affected by the harshness of the typical immigration enforcement regime. Children and families from Central America are coming despite a journey that is often dangerous, and coming despite the possibility that they might not make it. It\u2019s hard to deter people who are already so desperate.",
