Roessler Jr. \u2014 Fairfax County 's top cop \u2014 appeared none too pleased with the officer in question . Here 's how Roessler 's statement concluded :\nAs a matter of full transparency to our community \u2014 our police officer violated our longstanding policy and deprived a person of their freedom , which is unacceptable . We have been informed by ICE that the driver was released after three hours and issued an ankle monitor . When I learned of this event , I directed an immediate internal investigation to look at all factors in this matter to ensure that all are held accountable for this violation . Our county is one of the most diverse counties in the nation and no one should have the perception that FCPD is acting as a civil immigration agent for ICE . This matter damages our reputation and the longstanding policy that I have stated many times that our officers shall not act as immigration agents . The officer involved in this event has been relieved of all law enforcement duties pending the outcome of this investigation . It is my duty to enforce our FCPD \u2013 and Fairfax County \u2013 policies and hold all accountable for their actions .\nBut exactly one day later , Roessler reversed course and said the officer 's suspension was over , although the investigation was still ongoing , the Washington Times said .\n`` We have one of the best police forces in the U.S. , and I have confidence that our officer will represent us well throughout his career , '' the chief said in a statement , according to the paper .\nWhat gives ? Particularly when immigrant-rights activists extended kudos to Roessler and said he showed solidarity with their communities , the Times noted .\nTurns out that public outcry in the form of assistance and support offers for the suspended cop came pouring in , the paper said .\nWhat 's more , some folks on Twitter were n't too happy with Roessler , either :\n`` We have a complete moron as chief of @ FairfaxCountyPD \u2014 Chief Edwin Roessler is a 'social justice ' politician first a law enforcement professional not so much \u2014 he needs to go \u2014 as does the 2007 policy of non-cooperation with ICE , '' one user opined .\n`` Good job # EdwinRoessler , suspend your officers for enforcing the law .
