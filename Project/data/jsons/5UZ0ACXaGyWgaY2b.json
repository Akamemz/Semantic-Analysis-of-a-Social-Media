    "content": "WASHINGTON\u2014Six days after reaching the nuclear deal with Iran , the White House in July set up what aides dubbed an \u201c anti-war room \u201d in the basement of the West Wing .\nThe windowless hub became the seat of the administration \u2019 s aggressive campaign to push back against critics of the deal . Whiteboards listed lawmakers \u2019 positions . Computer screens logged onto Twitter to monitor commentary from opponents , and a small television helped staffers keep tabs on the cable-news debate . For weeks , the operation buzzed with senior White House officials , digital gurus and rank-and-file aides running a rapid-response operation .\nThe \u201c anti-war \u201d name of the room underscored the White House \u2019 s realization earlier this year that the nuclear deal was unlikely to win any Republican votes in Congress and would require a battle plan focused on mustering support among Democrats skeptical of the deal . It also reflected a chief White House message : Those who supported the nuclear deal favored diplomacy ; opponents favored war with Iran .\nAdministration officials ran the operation like a political campaign , using well-funded outside groups to lay the groundwork for casting supporters of the deal as pro-war , soliciting public endorsements from foreign-policy heavyweights and rekindling relationships with congressional Democrats sidelined since the Republican takeover of the House in the 2010 election and the Senate in 2014 .\n\u201c The primary focus was securing the support of Democrats , \u201d said Ben Rhodes , a deputy national security adviser .\nThe resulting narrow , partisan victory this week leaves President Barack Obama \u2019 s top foreign-policy initiative vulnerable to challenges and vigorous debate in the 2016 campaigns , much like his signature domestic achievement , the Affordable Care Act , which defined elections and shaped congressional deliberations over the past five years .\nThe accord also faces hurdles in coming weeks as Iran \u2019 s parliament prepares to vote on it and Republicans on Capitol Hill pivot from a stinging defeat to efforts to scuttle the deal in other ways , including legal challenges and legislation hitting Tehran with new sanctions opposed by the White House .\nIn Mr. Obama \u2019 s view , the potential fallout was worth it , because the stakes involving the Iranian nuclear program were so high , administration officials said .\nDuring the fight over his health-care bill , debate dragged on for nearly a year before Mr. Obama disbanded efforts to draw GOP support and engineered a victory solely with Democratic votes . Mr. Obama had a smaller window under the Iran Nuclear Review Act\u201460 days\u2014in which to make sure the Iran deal survived in Congress . And all he needed were enough Democratic votes in either the House or Senate to sustain his veto of a congressional resolution rejecting the deal .\nIn the end , Mr. Obama never had to issue a veto , as all but four Senate Democrats joined forces on Thursday to block a vote on a resolution to reject the deal .\nUntil recently , Mr. Obama \u2019 s fire wall had been the House . The White House earlier this summer zeroed in on House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( D. , Calif. ) as a critical ally . As speaker , Mrs. Pelosi had been a key driver in the successful passage of the health-care law in 2010 . If she was on board , Mr. Obama knew he could count on her to deliver House Democrats on the Iran deal .\nAfter the pact was reached on July 14 , Mr. Obama \u2019 s first meeting with lawmakers was with Mrs. Pelosi and the small team of Democrats who were helping her whip votes in the House . She methodically built support .

Mr. Obama made every call she recommended , the aide said .\nThe president singled her out in his statement Friday praising House Democrats for voting in favor of the deal .\nEarly in its campaign , the White House partnered with a range of liberal action groups , veterans organizations and Christian affiliates to bolster its efforts to pressure Congress . A key player was the San Francisco-based Ploughshares Fund , according to U.S. officials . Ploughshares has spent more than $ 7 million in the past four years funding think tanks , media organizations and activist groups focused on championing diplomacy with Iran .\nThe Ploughshares coalition includes a former Iranian government spokesman , the liberal Jewish organization J Street and a group of former U.S. diplomats who have held private talks with Iranian officials .\nA week before the deal was reached , Ploughshares organized for the White House a conference call for around 100 activist groups to strategize how to promote the Iran deal .
