Achieving a nuclear deal he first began pursuing even before he became secretary of state could redefine his place in history .\nAnd that , Republican critics , foreign officials , and even some ex-administration officials say , is a big problem . Kerry \u2019 s eagerness for a deal , they argue , risks that the Iranians will seduce him into a bad one .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t know how anyone who has observed Kerry over the past two years would think differently , \u201d says a former administration official who worked on Iran issues .\nKerry allies and administration officials strongly dispute the critique . On two previously unreported occasions this year , Kerry has threatened to break off negotiations , at least temporarily , according to a source familiar with the talks .\nSpeculation about Kerry \u2019 s mind-set has peaked in the home stretch of the negotiations , which the six powers in Vienna agreed Tuesday to extend until July 7 , a week past the original June 30 deadline .\nKerry has certainly worked relentlessly toward a deal . His many one-on-one meetings with Iran Foreign Minister Javad Zarif , for instance , have raised eyebrows among foreign diplomats who worry he may put too much stock in that relationship .\nKerry \u2019 s personal role has also become a focus of criticism from Capitol Hill Republicans .\n\u201c I think he is desperate for an agreement , \u201d Republican Sen. John McCain told MSNBC in March . Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker has told Kerry directly that \u201c it \u2019 s just as much of a legacy to walk away from a bad deal . \u201d\nKerry \u2019 s loyalists say the critique underestimates both Kerry \u2019 s fidelity to the national interest , as well as his political savvy .\n\u201c Newsflash : If Kerry was satisfied with less , he \u2019 d already have taken it . He \u2019 s held out for more , \u201d said his former longtime chief of staff , David Wade . \u201c A deal that doesn \u2019 t get the job done isn \u2019 t something he \u2019 d ever stake his reputation on , period. \u201d Wade said Kerry would not agree to a deal he could not confidently defend from critics in Capitol Hill hearings .\nThe concern is that , in search of a historic accomplishment with his name on it , Kerry might succumb to wishful thinking . As a senator , Kerry was dogged by the critique that he authored few major bills over his 30-year career . He won the Democratic nomination in 2004 but lost his bid for the presidency . And since arriving at Foggy Bottom he has been frustrated in his efforts to contain Vladimir Putin in Ukraine and , above all , in his so-far fruitless quest for Middle East peace .\nAllies say the conventional wisdom sells short his Senate and Foggy Bottom record , including his recent role brokering a peaceful resolution to Afghanistan \u2019 s disputed presidential election amid fears of a civil war .\nKerry has also shown that he can play chicken , as evidenced by two recent episodes from the nuclear talks .\nIn February , Kerry was in London with plans to head to Geneva the next morning for a meeting with Zarif when word came from U.S. negotiators already in Switzerland that the Iranians were dug in on a crucial point . Kerry scratched his early-morning departure and threatened to return to Washington ; the Iranians relented and Kerry flew to Switzerland later the following day for a productive session .\nThe talks were snagged on a different issue ahead of the political framework agreement struck in Lausanne , Switzerland on April 2 . Kerry and Zarif were the only top ministers present at the time , and after more than two days of arguing over the same point , Kerry was fed up . He arranged for an evening visit to Zarif \u2019 s hotel room , during which he warned the Iranian that he was prepared to tell other ministers flying in the next day to cancel their plans . The next morning , Zarif showed new flexibility on the point and the talks proceeded .\n\u201c His first instinct is to find a creative solution , \u201d says a senior administration official . \u201c But he realizes when things are stuck and is perfectly willing to move on . \u201d\nOthers noted that the portrait of Kerry as a mark oversimplifies how the nuclear talks work . While Kerry spends hours in meetings with the Iranians , he is not the final arbiter of the U.S. position .

The night before the April agreement , Kerry spoke by phone from Lausanne with Rice and Obama in Rice \u2019 s West Wing office .

A new article in the conservative Weekly Standard attacking Obama \u2019 s \u201c capitulation \u201d to Iran notes that Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes has likened an Iran deal to Obamacare in its importance to the administration .\nObama challenged the idea that he is overeager for a nuclear deal in an interview last month with The Atlantic \u2019 s Jeffrey Goldberg . \u201c Twenty years from now \u2026 [ if ] Iran has a nuclear weapon , it \u2019 s my name on this , \u201d Obama said , adding : \u201c I have a personal interest in locking this down . \u201d\nBut Kerry \u2019 s own investment is also huge .
