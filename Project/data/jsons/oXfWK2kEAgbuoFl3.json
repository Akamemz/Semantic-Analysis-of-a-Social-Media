    "content": "In recent months , a vocal group of conservatives has joined with Democrats in arguing that it 's time for the government to correct a blatant market failure : the private sector 's inability to provide sufficient paid leave . A new study suggests otherwise .\nThe study by the Cato Institute 's Vanessa Brown Calder is called `` Parental Leave : Is There a Case for Government Action ? '' Before diving into the report findings , I want to question the timing of the conservative interest in government-provided paid leave . The economy is doing well and growing fast ; unemployment rates , no matter how you measure them , are pretty low ; and companies that have to compete for the better employees are expanding benefits , including paid leave . In other words , it 's an odd moment for conservatives to shift their position on government-provided paid leave , no matter how light the intervention .\nThe first issue Brown Calder tackles is the question of what the private provision of paid leave looks like . It 's meant to answer a recurring talking point from those who advocate for a federal paid leave policy that states that the United States is the only developed nation without a national paid family leave policy , though a few states have created their own programs . Because some of these supporters understand that the lack of federal provision does n't mean that the private sector is n't providing the benefit , they add that the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that only 15 percent of women benefit from paid leave .\nBrown Calder then unpacks these notions . First she looks at the BLS number and finds that it does n't come close to including all paid leave options and benefits provided by private employers . Using more comprehensive government metrics , she shows that without the government mandating or paying for a paid parental leave benefit , between 45 percent and 63 percent of women report already having access to paid leave . The best part of this story is actually that the data show how the private sector has steadily increased its provision of paid leave to first-time mothers from 16 percent since the 1960s to over 50 percent in 2008 ( the last time data were available ) . If you add disability ( which is often used as paid leave ) , that number grows to 61 percent , which is a 280 percent increase over the period .\nAs a result , the share of first-time mothers who quit working declined `` from over 60 percent in 1961 to just over 20 percent in 2008 . '' As Brown Calder writes , `` This represents a 66 percent decline in first-time mothers who quit their jobs , in the absence of federal government supported leave . ''\nEven in the absence of updated data , we can assume this upper trend is continuing . She writes , `` Over 100 large name-brand companies have created or expanded paid family leave policies over the last three years , and a long list of major companies , including Walmart , Walgreens , Home Depot , Target , Starbucks , Amazon , FedEx , and McDonald 's , have created or expanded paid leave programs since late 2017 alone . ''\nBetter news yet is that this expansion benefited low-wage and hourly workers , too . This is important since the data is clear that the women or men who do n't benefit from paid leave are historically lower-income women and hourly wage workers . Many of these workers do n't even qualify for the current 12 weeks of unpaid , job-protected leave through the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 .\nUnfortunately , as her report shows too well , as much as we would love for everyone to get paid leave , a government-provided solution to the issue wo n't result in the proverbial free lunch that supporters hope for . It 's likely to have minimal effect , as the new benefit will be offset over time by lower wages . It could also give an incentive to employers to discriminate against childbearing-age workers for the benefits of older workers .\nThe study offers more evidence that government-provided paid leave results in fewer women in leadership roles , higher unemployment , and lesser pay for women . Brown Calder concludes suggesting that policymakers `` think broadly about improving workers ' lives and focus on removing barriers to workers ' career choices and improving economic efficiency . '' This can be done , for example , by eliminating licensing requirements and other regulations that increase the cost of child care\u2014or implementing the 2017 Working Families Flexibility Act , allowing employees to bank overtime compensation and use it as future time off .
