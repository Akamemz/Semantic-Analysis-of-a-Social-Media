    "content": "BURLINGTON , Vt.\u2014Early on in his eight years as the mayor of this city , when he typically dressed in a tieless ensemble of work boots and corduroys , Bernie Sanders one day left City Hall and found a ticket on the windshield of his rusty Volkswagen Dasher . The offense : This was the mayor \u2019 s spot , and , surely , a cop had thought , this was not the mayor \u2019 s car . But it was . It matched perfectly with both Sanders \u2019 image as a scrappy advocate of the little guy and his own shaky financial reality . It was the beginning of the 1980s , and he was approaching 40 , a single father of a not-quite-teenage son , renting a sparse second-floor apartment and having a hard time keeping up with his bills . \u201c Not only , \u201d he wrote on his yellow , coffee-splotched legal pads kept in archives at the University of Vermont , \u201c do I not pay bills every month\u2014 \u2018 What , every month ? \u2019 \u2014I am unable to \u2026 \u201d His scribbles in barely legible cursive in the margins read like reminders and afterthoughts : \u201c gas , \u201d \u201c light , \u201d \u201c water . \u201d\nHe was , said Bruce Seifer , a friend of Sanders , an economic aide in his administration and one of many people who know him who told me this , \u201c frugal. \u201d Seifer paused and considered the right way to put it . \u201c That \u2019 s a nice way of saying he \u2019 s a cheap son of a bitch . \u201d\nToday , he might still be cheap , but he \u2019 s sure not poor . In the wake of his 2016 presidential run , the most lucrative thing he \u2019 s ever done , the 77-year-old self-described democratic socialist is a three-home-owning millionaire with a net worth approaching at least $ 2 million , taking into account his publicly outlined assets and liabilities along with the real estate he owns outright . In a strict , bottom-line sense , Sanders has become one of those rich people against whom he has so unrelentingly railed . The champion of the underclass and castigator of \u201c the 1 percent \u201d has found himself in the socioeconomic penthouse of his rhetorical boogeymen . This development , seen mostly as the result of big bucks brought in by the slate of books he \u2019 s put out in the past few years , predictably has elicited snarky pokes , partisan jabs and charges of hypocrisy . The millionaire socialist !\nSanders has been impatient to the point of churlish when pressed about this . \u201c I wrote a best-selling book , \u201d he told the New York Times after he releasing the last 10 years of his tax returns . \u201c If you write a best-selling book , you can be a millionaire , too. \u201d Asked on Fox News if this sort of success was \u201c the definition of capitalism , \u201d he bristled . \u201c You know , I have a college degree , \u201d he said .\nBased on a deeper examination of his financial disclosures , tax returns , property records in Washington and Vermont , and scarcely leafed-through scraps of his financial papers housed at the University of Vermont , Sanders \u2019 current financial portrait is not only some stroke-of-luck windfall , it \u2019 s also the product ( with the help of his wife ) of decades of planning . The upward trajectory from that jalopy of his to his relative riches now\u2014as off-brand as it is for a man who once said he had \u201c no great desire to be rich \u201d \u2014is the product of years of middle-class striving , replete with credit card debt , real estate upgrades and an array of investment funds and retirement accounts .\nAs an immigrant \u2019 s son who started close to the bottom and has ended up near to the top , Sanders has a narrative arc that would form the backbone of the campaign story of almost any other candidate . But it \u2019 s more complicated for him . There \u2019 s never been anybody like Sanders in the modern political history of this country\u2014somebody who made a career out of haranguing millionaires \u2026 and who is now a millionaire himself . There is no set strategy for how to run for president as a democratic socialist with an expensive lakefront summer house . Americans generally don \u2019 t begrudge millionaires their millions\u2014and , as Donald Trump has confirmed , the aura of wealth can serve as a useful means of self-promotion\u2014but what to make of Sanders \u2019 apparently conflicting narratives ?\n\u201c He became the very thing he criticized others for becoming and at the same time didn \u2019 t fix any of the problems he \u2019 s been railing about that got him to this point , \u201d Boston-based Democratic strategist Mary Anne Marsh told me .\n\u201c He almost at times sounds like he thinks it \u2019 s inherently evil to be well-off , \u201d veteran Democratic strategist Bob Shrum said in an interview .\nDoes all of this make Sanders \u2019 abiding calls for economic justice more authoritative or compelling , especially as he , the ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee , argues on the 2020 hustings for costly programs like tuition-free college and universal health care , or does it defuse his drilled-home political brand and somehow muffle his message ?\n\u201c I think it \u2019 s only awkward if someone has sort of a facile understanding of what Bernie is trying to accomplish , \u201d senior Sanders adviser Jeff Weaver told me , \u201c which is to give lots of people opportunities to have a modicum of security . \u201d\nWhat \u2019 s certain , though , is that how Sanders has become wealthy and how he has managed his money are two of the least radical things about the self-identified radical Sanders .\nLeft : The old sugar house in the land near Middlesex , a quarter of a mile into the woods off Shady Rill Road . The primitive cabin , which had a dirt floor before Sanders installed wood , was the first place he lived in after he moved to Vermont . Right : Bernie Sanders pictured in 1972 , while running for governor on the Vermont Liberty Union ticket . | \u2588\u2588\u2588 ; AP Photo\nBefore he had three homes , Sanders grew up in a rent-controlled apartment with 3\u00bd rooms . The national economy boomed in the years after World War II , but in Sanders \u2019 corner of the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn , life meant cut-rate groceries and hand-me-down coats .\nHis parents , a Polish paint salesman and a homemaker , were \u201c solidly lower-middle class , \u201d as he once put it , and they argued frequently about money\u2014 \u201c arguments and more arguments , \u201d Sanders has said . \u201c Painful arguments . Bitter arguments . Arguments that seared through a little boy \u2019 s brain , never to be forgotten. \u201d There was some talk at the outset of his second presidential campaign that Sanders was reluctantly ready to share more of his past , but this at least is a piece of it he \u2019 s been talking about for as long as anybody \u2019 s been listening to him and writing it down . \u201c Money was a constant source of anxiety , \u201d he told a reporter from the Wall Street Journal in 1983 . \u201c Money was something the family , the whole neighborhood , was constantly preoccupied with , \u201d he told the Atlantic in 1985 . \u201c The money question to me , \u201d he wrote in a 2010 book titled The Jews of Capitol Hill , \u201c has always been very deep and emotional . \u201d\nSanders \u2019 mother died when he was 18 , and his father when he was 20 . He got \u201c a few thousand dollars \u201d of inheritance . And for $ 2,500 , the summer after he graduated from the University of Chicago , he and his first wife bought 85 acres of meadow and woods in Middlesex , Vermont , an out-of-the-way plot that came with an old maple \u201c sugarhouse. \u201d With no electricity or running water , life in the ascetic , dirt-floor , shacklike structure didn \u2019 t work out , and neither did his marriage .\nToward the end of the 1960s and throughout the the \u2019 70s , as he ran twice for governor and twice for the Senate as a member of the anti-war , left-wing , little-but-loud Liberty Union Party , Sanders worked sporadically as a carpenter and as a freelance writer and eventually made and sold to schools filmstrips about largely regional history . \u201c He was always poor , \u201d friend Sandy Baird told me . Sanders collected unemployment during one of his political campaigns , borrowed gas money for his battered beater of a VW bug and dangled extension cords to share electricity with a downstairs neighbor . He got evicted . He didn \u2019 t seem to those around him to be too worried about it . \u201c Everyone has to make sure that they survive , so obviously money was a concern , \u201d remembered Linda Niedweske , a nutritionist at the time who got to know Sanders and later would become a political aide , \u201c but it was never an overriding goal. \u201d Fellow pal Dean Corren agreed . \u201c I don \u2019 t think he ever really worried about that on a personal level , \u201d he said .\n\u201c He didn \u2019 t give a shit about clothes , \u201d said Tom Smith , a progressive activist and former city councilor . \u201c He didn \u2019 t care about his car . \u201d\nIn this respect , according to local attorney John Franco , a longtime confidant who \u2019 s known Sanders since the 70s , Sanders fit in with many of the congenitally parsimonious citizens of his adopted home . And it \u2019 s more than even that , Franco added . It \u2019 s not just that he didn \u2019 t and doesn \u2019 t want to spend money . \u201c He doesn \u2019 t want to be bothered . \u201d\nSanders also used his meager means to buttress his political aims , wielding it almost as a kind of authenticator for the crux of his lodestar view of the haves and have-nots . He lambasted \u201c a United States Congress composed of millionaires. \u201d He said again and again that it wasn \u2019 t right that their elected representatives appeared in his estimation to disproportionately serve \u201c the interests of corporations and big business\u2014their fellow millionaires . \u201d\nIn 1974 , waging one of his quixotic campaigns for the Senate , he practically ran more against Nelson Rockefeller than he did his actual opponents . And in 1976 , in releasing his financial disclosure as a candidate for governor , he attached a short statement that sat on the page not like an apology so much as a chest-out boast . \u201c Unfortunately , \u201d he said , \u201c there is not too much to report . At the present moment , I am \u2018 worth \u2019 about $ 1,100 , which includes a savings account and a 1967 car . I own no real estate , stocks or bonds . \u201d\nThis steadfast posture became more locally focused when he ran for mayor starting in the fall of 1980 . As the election of Ronald Reagan ushered in a conservative , pro-business age nationwide , Sanders prioritized tenants \u2019 rights , pledged he would not hike property taxes and promised a \u201c people-oriented \u201d waterfront instead of an enclave of high-priced condominiums . \u201c It is my belief , if present trends continue , \u201d he wrote in a crinkled newsprint pamphlet tucked in the UVM files , \u201c the City of Burlington will be converted into an area in which only the wealthy and upper-middle class will be able to afford to live. \u201d He knocked on door after door in the cold in the city \u2019 s poorer wards .\n\u201c Not having money , he was able to identify with these people , \u201d Garrison Nelson , a Vermont political science professor and veteran Sanders watcher , told me , \u201c and they were able to identify with him . \u201d\n\u201c He would walk into a home where people were fairly poor , \u201d former City Councilor Gary De Carolis said , \u201c and he \u2019 d be absolutely right at home . \u201d\nHe won by 10 votes . His new job came with a yearly salary of $ 33,824 , plenty hearty at that time , the equivalent of more than $ 100,000 in today \u2019 s dollars and easily more than he had ever made . \u201c It \u2019 s so strange , just having money , \u201d he marveled to a reporter from the Associated Press .\nNearing a year into his tenure , he bought a new car , a silver Honda Civic\u2014paying $ 6,400 and taking out a three-year loan , committing to monthly payments of $ 239.69 , according to records of the transaction in his files . After three fender benders , he came to regret the splurge . \u201c I knew I should never have bought a new car , \u201d he told New England Monthly .\nAnd shortly after his first reelection , in 1983 , perhaps feeling a smidgen more secure and emboldened , he stopped renting . With a mortgage of $ 49,500\u2014records don \u2019 t show what he put down , or the total price of the sale\u2014he purchased a two-story , six-room , 1,900-square-foot house on Catherine Street , a mile south of City Hall . The decor remained spartan . \u201c Not a whole lot of furniture , \u201d De Carolis recalled . Even so , and even then , the fact that the socialist mayor owned just one home caused some critics to tut-tut . \u201c I can remember lefties criticizing Bernie when he bought his first house , \u201d Franco told me . Their suggestion , he said : \u201c He was a bourgeois sellout when he did that . \u201d\n\u201c My political philosophy , \u201d Sanders penned in one of his legal pads , underlining his mid- \u2018 80s chicken scratch .\n\u201c Ultimately , I believe in democracy\u2014that we should live in a society where all of our citizens help decide what happens\u2014and where all of our citizens enjoy the fruits of their labor . In practical terms , the development of a democratic society in our nation would mean a far greater degree of citizen participation , public ownership of production , and a far more equal distribution of wealth and power , \u201d he wrote .\n\u201c Essentially , I believe that 200 people years after the 1st American Rev.\u2014we need a 2nd American Revolution . \u201d\nIn these private writings , he returned to this theme regularly .\n\u201c There is a great deal of confusion in this country as to what politics is really about , \u201d he wrote . What it wasn \u2019 t about : ads , TV , how a candidate looks , \u201c inane debates between Dems and Reps , saying the same thing . \u201d\nNo , he wrote . \u201c In politics , there are winners and losers , \u201d and the losers , Sanders believed , were \u201c the majority of our population who work hard\u2014day after day , year after year\u2014and often have nothing in the bank to show for their years of efforts . \u201d\n\u201c My view of politics , \u201d he wrote elsewhere in his notes , \u201c is that you can \u2019 t always represent everybody . Which side are you on ? The Class Issue is the major issue . \u201d\nWhen he was mayor , the monomania of Sanders \u2019 theory and rhetoric didn \u2019 t change , obviously\u2014but something else about him did . In retrospect , a step toward improving his finances in some sense was stabilizing the city \u2019 s .\nSurprising skeptical and even fearful local businessmen , surprising both Republicans and Democrats on the City Council , surprising his friends and , many say , even himself , \u201c Hizzoner the socialist , \u201d as the Boston Phoenix called him , proved to be a diligent and able steward of the municipal purse . \u201c He \u2019 s not a spender , \u201d Peter Clavelle , one of his top economic staffers who succeeded him as mayor , told me . \u201c He was , in fact , a fiscal conservative that managed the city \u2019 s resources quite well . \u201d\nWith the help of a savvy treasurer in accountant Jonathan Leopold , Sanders found an unexpected surplus of $ 1.9 million , which he used to pave roads without hiking taxes . Putting out to bid the city \u2019 s fuel and insurance contracts , instituting the first audit in nearly 30 years of the city \u2019 s pension fund , and streamlining cooperation between departments , he saved hundreds of thousands of dollars . He upped fees for large-development building permits . He raised taxes on commercial properties , but opponents \u2019 ads saying Sanders \u201c does not believe in free enterprise \u201d fell flat . From his third-floor office , with a Eugene Debs poster hanging on the wall\u2014 \u201c Unionist . Socialist . Revolutionary , \u201d it said\u2014he launched an economic task force that led to the creation of the Community and Economic Development Office . \u201c It is my view that there is probably no more important area of concern for the City of Burlington than the issue of economic development , \u201d he wrote in announcing the endeavor .\n\u201c The Republicrat administrations were acting just like a big corporation , \u201d Sanders said in 1982 in an article in New York \u2019 s Ithaca Times , emphasizing his conviction that there was little difference between the two major parties . \u201c They were sluggish , without motivation or ideas . We had the good fortune to inherit that moribund system and revamp it . \u201d\n\u201c Socialist Mayor Presides Over a Spell of Prosperity , \u201d read a headline in Connecticut 's Hartford Courant in 1985 .\nThe \u201c red mayor in the Green Mountains , \u201d as Rolling Stone had dubbed him , was reelected the first time around with 53 percent of the vote , and in 1985 with 55 percent , and in 1987 with 56 .\nIf he wanted to talk about what he really wanted to talk about , which was income and wealth inequality , the burgeoning American \u201c oligarchy , \u201d and foreign policy , he knew , his advisers and friends said , that he first and foremost had to get right the dollars and cents . \u201c If he did a good job there , \u201d De Carolis said , \u201c then he could talk about what \u2019 s going on in Nicaragua . But he couldn \u2019 t talk about the inequalities of various parts of our country if he didn \u2019 t take care of that home front . \u201d\nHe was , W.J . Conroy wrote in the 2016 preface to his 1990 book about Sanders that started as his doctoral thesis in the \u2018 80s , a \u201c pragmatic socialist . \u201d\n\u201c Bernie himself may or may not have been a good financial manager , \u201d Steven Soifer told me . Now the chairman of the Department of Social Work at the University of Mississippi , he is the author of a 1991 book on Sanders \u2019 time as mayor . \u201c However , \u201d Soifer said , \u201c Bernie always had the skill of surrounding himself with very competent , sometimes brilliant people . \u201d\nOne of them was Bruce Seifer , a higher-up in the Community and Economic Development Office . \u201c It \u2019 s about fairness and democracy with a small \u2018 d , \u2019 \u201d he told me . \u201c You run government effectively and efficiently , No . 1 , and then you make sure that everybody does the job they \u2019 re supposed to do and everybody pays their fair share of taxes. \u201d But Sanders was at the helm . \u201c And the thing is , he \u2019 s not a radical , \u201d Seifer said . \u201c He \u2019 s just , like , your commonsense uncle . \u201d\nLooking back , the last two years of the '80s can be seen as the start of the rest of Sanders \u2019 life\u2014because that was the time when he really started using traditional tools of the country \u2019 s capitalistic financial system to put himself on firmer footing .\nIn May 1988 , he married Jane O \u2019 Meara Driscoll , a divorced mother of three who had been his significant other the entire time he was mayor and served as the director of his administration \u2019 s youth office . And that summer and fall , nearing the end of his fourth and final term at City Hall , Sanders ran for Congress as an independent , of course , and lost . But he lost by only 3.7 percentage points , and he beat the Democrat , effectively becoming , for the first time in his career , a realistic electoral option in a statewide race . \u201c A real breakthrough for him , \u201d Nelson , the UVM professor , told me . It was a hint of what was to come .\nAt the time , though , that \u2019 s all it was\u2014latent potential in a moment marked by unknowns and unease . Biding time and weighing his options , Sanders scrambled for paying gigs . In January 1989 , he contacted the chair of the sociology department at Hamilton College , four hours away in Clinton , New York . \u201c I believe , \u201d Sanders wrote to Dennis Gilbert , \u201c that I could offer your students an unusual academic perspective. \u201d After spending a semester as a fellow at the Institute of Politics at Harvard University \u2019 s Kennedy School of Government , he taught classes on urban sociology and social democracy at Hamilton . Leaning on the last hunk of his salary as mayor and speeches at colleges and universities , Sanders made more than $ 45,000 in 1989\u2014given inflation and the rising cost of living , it was effectively less than he had made when he was first mayor . At 50 and mulling another crapshoot of a congressional bid , he fretted . \u201c At Hamilton , \u201d Steve Rosenfeld , his 1990 press secretary , said , \u201c Bernie would often confide in Dennis , saying he was worried about his professional future and financial security. \u201d ( Gilbert told me he doesn \u2019 t recall this . )\nSanders and his wife responded by pooling resources . Central to their efforts ? One of the most reliable ways that millions upon millions of Americans have sought to leverage and improve their financial fortunes : real estate .\nIn September 1988 , according to local property records , Jane Sanders changed the house she owned on Isham Street to a house they owned\u2014kicking off a spate of activity and shifting legally from \u201c sole owner \u201d to \u201c Jane O \u2019 Meara Sanders and Bernard Sanders , husband and wife , as tenants by the entirety. \u201d Just two days later , they used the house to take out a mortgage of $ 50,000 . The following February , according to a three-line recording of the transaction in the Burlington Free Press , Sanders sold the house he had bought in 1983 with a $ 49,500 mortgage for $ 82,000\u2014a fine return on that first investment . Not quite three months later , leaving the more urban portion of Burlington and moving to a neighborhood closer to picturesque Lake Champlain , Bernie and Jane Sanders got a $ 140,000 mortgage to purchase for $ 175,500 a three-bedroom , two-bathroom , not-quite-1,600-square-foot house on Killarney Drive\u2014 \u201c a red-paneled , boxy , split-level house , \u201d as Rosenfeld would describe it , \u201c that could be in any middle-class suburb in America. \u201d Barely more than a month after that , they sold the house on Isham for $ 135,000 .\nOn his book , Our Revolution , Sanders made $ 880,091.14 in 2017 . He came out with another book , Where We Go From Here , in 2018 . | Aaron Davidson/WireImage ; AP Photo/Alex Brandon\nIn 1990 , sometimes wearing a blue blazer missing a button and working out of a cramped basement office in the Killarney house\u2014which had plywood tables , a painted-shut window and green indoor-outdoor carpet\u2014and getting into hot water in the news for paying his staffers as contractors instead of as full-time employees , Sanders tried again to win Vermont \u2019 s sole seat in the House\u2014and this time , he did . In the aftermath of his victory , he was a mixture of exultant and indignant . \u201c I \u2019 m not an insider , \u201d he said . \u201c I know who I am . I know where I came from . I don \u2019 t need to get down on my knees and ask rich people for help. \u201d After having excoriated members of Congress for voting to give themselves pay raises two years earlier\u2014 \u201c quite beyond comprehension , \u201d he huffed in a letter to the three members of Vermont \u2019 s congressional delegation that he had made public as a mayoral news release\u2014Sanders started making considerably more than he had ever earned : $ 125,100 a year .\nIn the first half of the '90s , though\u2014as the crotchety independent butted heads with Democrats in Washington while navigating the topsy-turvy political terrain of the time and as the election of Bill Clinton spawned the rise of increasingly virulent , Newt Gingrich-led hyperpartisanship\u2014Sanders \u2019 prospects were far from ensured . And he used his house to hedge his bets . He signed over power of attorney to his wife , and they refinanced their home in 1991 and again in 1993 , both times with mortgages larger than the one they had agreed to in 1989\u2014 $ 140,500 in '91 , $ 145,600 in '93 .\nSanders settled in , though , as a more and more fixed political presence in Vermont . His race in 1994 was the last one he could have lost , really , as he cemented his status and security .\nIn 2000 , with a real estate boom underway , and with a mortgage of $ 62,100 , he and his wife bought in essence their first second home\u2014a condominium in Burlington , which they initially bought for Jane Sanders \u2019 elderly mother , according to Weaver , and used intermittently as a place for extended family or a rental property .\nIn 2004 , Jane Sanders was hired as the president of Burlington College , a small , middling liberal arts school . Making a six-figure salary , she saw her tenure end in acrimony after her decision to pursue a campus expansion by making a $ 10 million land purchase crippled the institution . She resigned in 2014 and took with her a $ 200,000 severance package some called a golden parachute . In 2016 , the debt-beset college closed for good , felled by \u201c an inexperienced president , \u201d in the barbed words of Jane Sanders \u2019 successor .\nIn the meantime , Bernie Sanders \u2019 career was heading in the opposite direction : up . In 2006 , he was elected to the Senate . At the top of a surging real estate market in 2007 , with his congressional salary at $ 165,200 , Sanders bought a row home in Washington for $ 489,000 , adding to the condo and house on Killarney and quietly climbing some financial stair steps when far fewer people were paying him any attention .\nAnd in 2009 , when the markets were crashing and half of the 100 senators were still worth a million dollars or more , Sanders \u2019 estimated net worth clocked in at $ 105,000 , according to the Center for Responsive Politics\u2014at the bottom of the Senate wealth chart . In Burlington , Bernie and Jane Sanders returned to real estate , using a mortgage of $ 324,000 to purchase a $ 405,000 upgrade : a four-bedroom , 2,352-square-foot house sitting atop a slow slope of a hill up from the street on Van Patten Parkway . ( They bought the house , interestingly , from her son , David Driscoll , and his wife . In 2012 , for $ 265,000 , Driscoll and his wife bought from Jane and Bernie Sanders the Killarney house . Effectively , they swapped houses . Driscoll , Weaver said , wanted to live in \u201c his childhood home. \u201d ) In 2013 , Bernie and Jane Sanders refinanced the Van Patten house , taking out a mortgage of $ 312,275 .\nAnd in 2015 , when he started running for president , he had a net worth of a little more than $ 700,000 , according to CRP calculations , a financial picture that had all his assets in his wife \u2019 s name and liabilities from a pair of mortgages as well as credit card debt listed as between $ 25,002 and $ 65,000 . It made him , a spokesman said at the time , \u201c a regular American. \u201d More \u201c regular , \u201d perhaps , than he should have been : According to the Federal Reserve , the average household in 2015 had credit card debt of about $ 10,000 .\n\u201c Unfortunately , \u201d Sanders said during his 2016 presidential campaign , using the same effacing opening clause and striking the same tone that he had in his financial disclosure of 40 years before , \u201c I remain one of the poorer members of the United States Senate . \u201d\nBut for the politics he practiced\u2014always\u2014it was a useful note to sound .\nHe all but compared his finances to those of front-running Hillary Clinton , she of the high-dollar speaking fees . \u201c That type of wealth , \u201d he said , \u201c has the potential to isolate you from the reality of the world . \u201d\nIt wasn \u2019 t long before unprecedented money for Sanders started rolling in .\nDriving from address to address , I recently made a quick self-guided tour of Sanders \u2019 sequence of houses in the Queen City of Vermont , tracing from Catherine to Isham to Killarney to Van Patten the almost 40 years of the socialist \u2019 s slow climb to the upper class . I stared at his car , a red 2010 Chevrolet Aveo , parked in his driveway .\nThen , though , I carried on an hour so north , to bucolic North Hero , some 20 miles south of the Canadian border , to see the emblem of the economic altitude to which Sanders has ascended\u2014the third house , the summer house , the house with rustic wood sides , a silver-colored tin roof , four bedrooms and 500 feet of waterfront that Bernie and Jane Sanders bought for $ 575,000 , cash , through an entity they created called the Islands Trust . \u201c Jane \u2019 s idea was to have something that would stay in the family , \u201d Weaver told me , \u201c over generations , and that sort of structure was the way to help accomplish that . \u201d\nPast horses and silos and campsites and apple farms , it \u2019 s nestled at the end of a gravel private lane , hidden behind a cluster of evergreens , looking out over the wide , resplendent blue of Lake Champlain .\nMuch has changed in these past four years . In 2015 , Sanders had that credit card debt and two mortgages that ranged from $ 250,001 to $ 500,000 , according to his Senate financial disclosure of that year . In 2016 , the credit card debt was gone , and one of those mortgages had been halved . By 2018 , only one of the mortgages remained ; that January , records show , he paid off what was left of the $ 312,275 mortgage he had on his main house in Vermont .\nIn 2015 , he published a book called The Speech , basically a transcript of his memorable 2010 filibuster on ( what else ? ) corporate greed , income inequality and the decline of the middle class . Sanders made $ 3,035 , which he donated to charity . In 2016 , though , book money began to pile up . He got a $ 795,000 advance to write Our Revolution . He pocketed an additional $ 70,484 in royalties . In 2017 , the book royalties added up to $ 880,091.14 . And last year , while they dipped , they still were a hunk of money : $ 392,810.37 .\nThe Sanders \u2019 tax returns , too , tell the tale : From 2015 to 2018 , their total income went from $ 240,622 to $ 1,073,333 to $ 1,150,891 to $ 566,421 . Some of that , along with money from a retirement account , according to Jane Sanders , and proceeds from a sale of a share of a family home of hers , helped pay for the lake house that I sat and looked at while listening to birds chirp in the chill of spring in the northern reaches of New England .\n\u201c Bernie is a known quantity in any socialist paradise , \u201d GOP consultant Rick Wilson told me , \u201c the party apparatchik with the dacha ... \u201d\nThis kind of characterization makes Sanders \u2019 friends and others who \u2019 ve known him for years all but roll their eyes .\n\u201c He \u2019 s still the same cranky guy , \u201d said Terje Anderson , chairman of the Vermont Democratic Party . \u201c I run into him at Hannaford shopping for groceries . \u201d\nAnd in his cart , I asked , aren \u2019 t the finest meats and cheeses ?\n\u201c There \u2019 s no change , \u201d Niedweske added . \u201c His priorities remain the same . \u201d\n\u201c I mean , I don \u2019 t think any of Bernie \u2019 s supporters said , \u2018 Oh , well , now that he \u2019 s made a lot of money selling a book \u2026 I can \u2019 t support him anymore , \u2019 \u201d Terry Bouricius , a former Burlington city councilor and progressive who \u2019 s known Sanders since the '70s , told me . \u201c No\u2014I don \u2019 t think that happened to anybody . \u201d\nA spectrum of politicos I talked to don \u2019 t think this is that big of a political problem for Sanders . He has problems , they said , that are bigger than his bottom line\u2014his persistent lack of appeal to female voters and black voters , for instance , and his generally sagging poll numbers ever since an evidently formidable Joe Biden entered the race , and the slap-in-the-face mathematical fact that this time around he \u2019 s running against not Hillary Clinton but 20-plus Democrats . He is , in other words , no longer the beneficiary of the anybody-but-her voters .\n\u201c The least of his problems , \u201d Marsh , the Democratic strategist from Boston , said of Sanders ' wealth .\n\u201c Detractors will needle and pester and continue to push that argument , \u201d said Joe Trippi , a Democratic strategist who \u2019 s been working on presidential campaigns for almost 40 years . \u201c But I don \u2019 t think in the end it \u2019 s going to have much impact . \u201d\n\u201c On the list of stuff that bothers me about Bernie , \u201d said Stuart Stevens , a GOP consultant who was the chief strategist for Mitt Romney \u2019 s 2012 run , \u201c the fact that he wrote a book and made some money doesn \u2019 t bother me at all . \u201d\n\u201c I \u2019 m not going to sit here and shit on Bernie Sanders for being a millionaire , \u201d the former South Carolina lawmaker and current Kamala Harris supporter told me .",
    "content_original": "Michael Kruse is a senior staff writer for Politico.\n\nBURLINGTON, Vt.\u2014Early on in his eight years as the mayor of this city, when he typically dressed in a tieless ensemble of work boots and corduroys, Bernie Sanders one day left City Hall and found a ticket on the windshield of his rusty Volkswagen Dasher. The offense: This was the mayor\u2019s spot, and, surely, a cop had thought, this was not the mayor\u2019s car. But it was. It matched perfectly with both Sanders\u2019 image as a scrappy advocate of the little guy and his own shaky financial reality. It was the beginning of the 1980s, and he was approaching 40, a single father of a not-quite-teenage son, renting a sparse second-floor apartment and having a hard time keeping up with his bills. \u201cNot only,\u201d he wrote on his yellow, coffee-splotched legal pads kept in archives at the University of Vermont, \u201cdo I not pay bills every month\u2014\u2018What, every month?\u2019\u2014I am unable to \u2026\u201d His scribbles in barely legible cursive in the margins read like reminders and afterthoughts: \u201cgas,\u201d \u201clight,\u201d \u201cwater.\u201d\n\nHe was, said Bruce Seifer, a friend of Sanders, an economic aide in his administration and one of many people who know him who told me this, \u201cfrugal.\u201d Seifer paused and considered the right way to put it. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice way of saying he\u2019s a cheap son of a bitch.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nToday, he might still be cheap, but he\u2019s sure not poor. In the wake of his 2016 presidential run, the most lucrative thing he\u2019s ever done, the 77-year-old self-described democratic socialist is a three-home-owning millionaire with a net worth approaching at least $2 million, taking into account his publicly outlined assets and liabilities along with the real estate he owns outright. In a strict, bottom-line sense, Sanders has become one of those rich people against whom he has so unrelentingly railed. The champion of the underclass and castigator of \u201cthe 1 percent\u201d has found himself in the socioeconomic penthouse of his rhetorical boogeymen. This development, seen mostly as the result of big bucks brought in by the slate of books he\u2019s put out in the past few years, predictably has elicited snarky pokes, partisan jabs and charges of hypocrisy. The millionaire socialist!\n\nSanders has been impatient to the point of churlish when pressed about this. \u201cI wrote a best-selling book,\u201d he told the New York Times after he releasing the last 10 years of his tax returns. \u201cIf you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too.\u201d Asked on Fox News if this sort of success was \u201cthe definition of capitalism,\u201d he bristled. \u201cYou know, I have a college degree,\u201d he said.\n\nBased on a deeper examination of his financial disclosures, tax returns, property records in Washington and Vermont, and scarcely leafed-through scraps of his financial papers housed at the University of Vermont, Sanders\u2019 current financial portrait is not only some stroke-of-luck windfall, it\u2019s also the product (with the help of his wife) of decades of planning. The upward trajectory from that jalopy of his to his relative riches now\u2014as off-brand as it is for a man who once said he had \u201cno great desire to be rich\u201d\u2014is the product of years of middle-class striving, replete with credit card debt, real estate upgrades and an array of investment funds and retirement accounts.\n\nAs an immigrant\u2019s son who started close to the bottom and has ended up near to the top, Sanders has a narrative arc that would form the backbone of the campaign story of almost any other candidate. But it\u2019s more complicated for him. There\u2019s never been anybody like Sanders in the modern political history of this country\u2014somebody who made a career out of haranguing millionaires \u2026 and who is now a millionaire himself. There is no set strategy for how to run for president as a democratic socialist with an expensive lakefront summer house. Americans generally don\u2019t begrudge millionaires their millions\u2014and, as Donald Trump has confirmed, the aura of wealth can serve as a useful means of self-promotion\u2014but what to make of Sanders\u2019 apparently conflicting narratives?\n\n\u201cHe became the very thing he criticized others for becoming and at the same time didn\u2019t fix any of the problems he\u2019s been railing about that got him to this point,\u201d Boston-based Democratic strategist Mary Anne Marsh told me.\n\n\u201cHe almost at times sounds like he thinks it\u2019s inherently evil to be well-off,\u201d veteran Democratic strategist Bob Shrum said in an interview.\n\nDoes all of this make Sanders\u2019 abiding calls for economic justice more authoritative or compelling, especially as he, the ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee, argues on the 2020 hustings for costly programs like tuition-free college and universal health care, or does it defuse his drilled-home political brand and somehow muffle his message?\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s only awkward if someone has sort of a facile understanding of what Bernie is trying to accomplish,\u201d senior Sanders adviser Jeff Weaver told me, \u201cwhich is to give lots of people opportunities to have a modicum of security.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt depends on how it plays out,\u201d Shrum said.\n\nWhat\u2019s certain, though, is that how Sanders has become wealthy and how he has managed his money are two of the least radical things about the self-identified radical Sanders.\n\n\n\n***\n\nLeft: The old sugar house in the land near Middlesex, a quarter of a mile into the woods off Shady Rill Road.

Right: Bernie Sanders pictured in 1972, while running for governor on the Vermont Liberty Union ticket. | Politico; AP Photo\n\nBefore he had three homes, Sanders grew up in a rent-controlled apartment with 3\u00bd rooms. The national economy boomed in the years after World War II, but in Sanders\u2019 corner of the Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn, life meant cut-rate groceries and hand-me-down coats.\n\nHis parents, a Polish paint salesman and a homemaker, were \u201csolidly lower-middle class,\u201d as he once put it, and they argued frequently about money\u2014\u201carguments and more arguments,\u201d Sanders has said. \u201cPainful arguments. Bitter arguments. Arguments that seared through a little boy\u2019s brain, never to be forgotten.\u201d There was some talk at the outset of his second presidential campaign that Sanders was reluctantly ready to share more of his past, but this at least is a piece of it he\u2019s been talking about for as long as anybody\u2019s been listening to him and writing it down. \u201cMoney was a constant source of anxiety,\u201d he told a reporter from the Wall Street Journal in 1983. \u201cMoney was something the family, the whole neighborhood, was constantly preoccupied with,\u201d he told the Atlantic in 1985. \u201cThe money question to me,\u201d he wrote in a 2010 book titled The Jews of Capitol Hill, \u201chas always been very deep and emotional.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 mother died when he was 18, and his father when he was 20. He got \u201ca few thousand dollars\u201d of inheritance. And for $2,500, the summer after he graduated from the University of Chicago, he and his first wife bought 85 acres of meadow and woods in Middlesex, Vermont, an out-of-the-way plot that came with an old maple \u201csugarhouse.\u201d With no electricity or running water, life in the ascetic, dirt-floor, shacklike structure didn\u2019t work out, and neither did his marriage.\n\nToward the end of the 1960s and throughout the the \u201970s, as he ran twice for governor and twice for the Senate as a member of the anti-war, left-wing, little-but-loud Liberty Union Party, Sanders worked sporadically as a carpenter and as a freelance writer and eventually made and sold to schools filmstrips about largely regional history. \u201cHe was always poor,\u201d friend Sandy Baird told me. Sanders collected unemployment during one of his political campaigns, borrowed gas money for his battered beater of a VW bug and dangled extension cords to share electricity with a downstairs neighbor. He got evicted. He didn\u2019t seem to those around him to be too worried about it. \u201cEveryone has to make sure that they survive, so obviously money was a concern,\u201d remembered Linda Niedweske, a nutritionist at the time who got to know Sanders and later would become a political aide, \u201cbut it was never an overriding goal.\u201d Fellow pal Dean Corren agreed. \u201cI don\u2019t think he ever really worried about that on a personal level,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t give a shit about clothes,\u201d said Tom Smith, a progressive activist and former city councilor. \u201cHe didn\u2019t care about his car.\u201d\n\nIn this respect, according to local attorney John Franco, a longtime confidant who\u2019s known Sanders since the 70s, Sanders fit in with many of the congenitally parsimonious citizens of his adopted home. And it\u2019s more than even that, Franco added. It\u2019s not just that he didn\u2019t and doesn\u2019t want to spend money. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to be bothered.\u201d\n\nSanders also used his meager means to buttress his political aims, wielding it almost as a kind of authenticator for the crux of his lodestar view of the haves and have-nots. He lambasted \u201ca United States Congress composed of millionaires.\u201d He said again and again that it wasn\u2019t right that their elected representatives appeared in his estimation to disproportionately serve \u201cthe interests of corporations and big business\u2014their fellow millionaires.\u201d\n\nIn 1974, waging one of his quixotic campaigns for the Senate, he practically ran more against Nelson Rockefeller than he did his actual opponents. And in 1976, in releasing his financial disclosure as a candidate for governor, he attached a short statement that sat on the page not like an apology so much as a chest-out boast. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is not too much to report. At the present moment, I am \u2018worth\u2019 about $1,100, which includes a savings account and a 1967 car. I own no real estate, stocks or bonds.\u201d\n\nThis steadfast posture became more locally focused when he ran for mayor starting in the fall of 1980. As the election of Ronald Reagan ushered in a conservative, pro-business age nationwide, Sanders prioritized tenants\u2019 rights, pledged he would not hike property taxes and promised a \u201cpeople-oriented\u201d waterfront instead of an enclave of high-priced condominiums. \u201cIt is my belief, if present trends continue,\u201d he wrote in a crinkled newsprint pamphlet tucked in the UVM files, \u201cthe City of Burlington will be converted into an area in which only the wealthy and upper-middle class will be able to afford to live.\u201d He knocked on door after door in the cold in the city\u2019s poorer wards.\n\n\u201cNot having money, he was able to identify with these people,\u201d Garrison Nelson, a Vermont political science professor and veteran Sanders watcher, told me, \u201cand they were able to identify with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe would walk into a home where people were fairly poor,\u201d former City Councilor Gary De Carolis said, \u201cand he\u2019d be absolutely right at home.\u201d\n\nHe won by 10 votes. His new job came with a yearly salary of $33,824, plenty hearty at that time, the equivalent of more than $100,000 in today\u2019s dollars and easily more than he had ever made. \u201cIt\u2019s so strange, just having money,\u201d he marveled to a reporter from the Associated Press.\n\nNearing a year into his tenure, he bought a new car, a silver Honda Civic\u2014paying $6,400 and taking out a three-year loan, committing to monthly payments of $239.69, according to records of the transaction in his files. After three fender benders, he came to regret the splurge. \u201cI knew I should never have bought a new car,\u201d he told New England Monthly.\n\nAnd shortly after his first reelection, in 1983, perhaps feeling a smidgen more secure and emboldened, he stopped renting. With a mortgage of $49,500\u2014records don\u2019t show what he put down, or the total price of the sale\u2014he purchased a two-story, six-room, 1,900-square-foot house on Catherine Street, a mile south of City Hall. The decor remained spartan. \u201cNot a whole lot of furniture,\u201d De Carolis recalled. Even so, and even then, the fact that the socialist mayor owned just one home caused some critics to tut-tut. \u201cI can remember lefties criticizing Bernie when he bought his first house,\u201d Franco told me. Their suggestion, he said: \u201cHe was a bourgeois sellout when he did that.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\n\u201c My political philosophy ,\u201d Sanders penned in one of his legal pads, underlining his mid-\u201880s chicken scratch.\n\n\u201cUltimately, I believe in democracy\u2014that we should live in a society where all of our citizens help decide what happens\u2014and where all of our citizens enjoy the fruits of their labor. In practical terms, the development of a democratic society in our nation would mean a far greater degree of citizen participation, public ownership of production, and a far more equal distribution of wealth and power,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cEssentially, I believe that 200 people years after the 1st American Rev.\u2014we need a 2nd American Revolution.\u201d\n\nIn these private writings, he returned to this theme regularly.\n\n\u201cThere is a great deal of confusion in this country as to what politics is really about,\u201d he wrote. What it wasn\u2019t about: ads, TV, how a candidate looks, \u201cinane debates between Dems and Reps, saying the same thing.\u201d\n\nNo, he wrote. \u201cIn politics, there are winners and losers,\u201d and the losers, Sanders believed, were \u201cthe majority of our population who work hard\u2014day after day, year after year\u2014and often have nothing in the bank to show for their years of efforts.\u201d\n\nThose were the people he sought to represent.\n\n\u201cMy view of politics,\u201d he wrote elsewhere in his notes, \u201cis that you can\u2019t always represent everybody. Which side are you on? The Class Issue is the major issue.\u201d\n\nWhen he was mayor, the monomania of Sanders\u2019 theory and rhetoric didn\u2019t change, obviously\u2014but something else about him did. In retrospect, a step toward improving his finances in some sense was stabilizing the city\u2019s.\n\nSurprising skeptical and even fearful local businessmen, surprising both Republicans and Democrats on the City Council, surprising his friends and, many say, even himself, \u201cHizzoner the socialist,\u201d as the Boston Phoenix called him, proved to be a diligent and able steward of the municipal purse. \u201cHe\u2019s not a spender,\u201d Peter Clavelle, one of his top economic staffers who succeeded him as mayor, told me. \u201cHe was, in fact, a fiscal conservative that managed the city\u2019s resources quite well.\u201d\n\nWith the help of a savvy treasurer in accountant Jonathan Leopold, Sanders found an unexpected surplus of $1.9 million, which he used to pave roads without hiking taxes. Putting out to bid the city\u2019s fuel and insurance contracts, instituting the first audit in nearly 30 years of the city\u2019s pension fund, and streamlining cooperation between departments, he saved hundreds of thousands of dollars. He upped fees for large-development building permits. He raised taxes on commercial properties, but opponents\u2019 ads saying Sanders \u201cdoes not believe in free enterprise\u201d fell flat. From his third-floor office, with a Eugene Debs poster hanging on the wall\u2014\u201cUnionist. Socialist. Revolutionary,\u201d it said\u2014he launched an economic task force that led to the creation of the Community and Economic Development Office. \u201cIt is my view that there is probably no more important area of concern for the City of Burlington than the issue of economic development,\u201d he wrote in announcing the endeavor.\n\n\u201cThe Republicrat administrations were acting just like a big corporation,\u201d Sanders said in 1982 in an article in New York\u2019s Ithaca Times, emphasizing his conviction that there was little difference between the two major parties. \u201cThey were sluggish, without motivation or ideas. We had the good fortune to inherit that moribund system and revamp it.\u201d\n\nPhotoillustration by C.J. Burton; Getty Images\n\n\u201cSocialist Mayor Presides Over a Spell of Prosperity,\u201d read a headline in Connecticut's Hartford Courant in 1985.\n\nCity staffers sometimes claimed Sanders was \u201cout-Republicaning the Republicans.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrotskyites for Sound Fiscal Management,\u201d they joked.\n\nThe \u201cred mayor in the Green Mountains,\u201d as Rolling Stone had dubbed him, was reelected the first time around with 53 percent of the vote, and in 1985 with 55 percent, and in 1987 with 56.\n\nIf he wanted to talk about what he really wanted to talk about, which was income and wealth inequality, the burgeoning American \u201coligarchy,\u201d and foreign policy, he knew, his advisers and friends said, that he first and foremost had to get right the dollars and cents. \u201cIf he did a good job there,\u201d De Carolis said, \u201cthen he could talk about what\u2019s going on in Nicaragua. But he couldn\u2019t talk about the inequalities of various parts of our country if he didn\u2019t take care of that home front.\u201d\n\nHe was, W.J. Conroy wrote in the 2016 preface to his 1990 book about Sanders that started as his doctoral thesis in the \u201880s, a \u201cpragmatic socialist.\u201d\n\n\u201cBernie himself may or may not have been a good financial manager,\u201d Steven Soifer told me. Now the chairman of the Department of Social Work at the University of Mississippi, he is the author of a 1991 book on Sanders\u2019 time as mayor. \u201cHowever,\u201d Soifer said, \u201cBernie always had the skill of surrounding himself with very competent, sometimes brilliant people.\u201d\n\nOne of them was Bruce Seifer, a higher-up in the Community and Economic Development Office. \u201cIt\u2019s about fairness and democracy with a small \u2018d,\u2019\u201d he told me. \u201cYou run government effectively and efficiently, No. 1, and then you make sure that everybody does the job they\u2019re supposed to do and everybody pays their fair share of taxes.\u201d But Sanders was at the helm. \u201cAnd the thing is, he\u2019s not a radical,\u201d Seifer said. \u201cHe\u2019s just, like, your commonsense uncle.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nLooking back, the last two years of the '80s can be seen as the start of the rest of Sanders\u2019 life\u2014because that was the time when he really started using traditional tools of the country\u2019s capitalistic financial system to put himself on firmer footing.\n\nIn May 1988, he married Jane O\u2019Meara Driscoll, a divorced mother of three who had been his significant other the entire time he was mayor and served as the director of his administration\u2019s youth office. And that summer and fall, nearing the end of his fourth and final term at City Hall, Sanders ran for Congress as an independent, of course, and lost. But he lost by only 3.7 percentage points, and he beat the Democrat, effectively becoming, for the first time in his career, a realistic electoral option in a statewide race. \u201cA real breakthrough for him,\u201d Nelson, the UVM professor, told me. It was a hint of what was to come.\n\nAt the time, though, that\u2019s all it was\u2014latent potential in a moment marked by unknowns and unease. Biding time and weighing his options, Sanders scrambled for paying gigs. In January 1989, he contacted the chair of the sociology department at Hamilton College, four hours away in Clinton, New York. \u201cI believe,\u201d Sanders wrote to Dennis Gilbert, \u201cthat I could offer your students an unusual academic perspective.\u201d After spending a semester as a fellow at the Institute of Politics at Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government, he taught classes on urban sociology and social democracy at Hamilton. Leaning on the last hunk of his salary as mayor and speeches at colleges and universities, Sanders made more than $45,000 in 1989\u2014given inflation and the rising cost of living, it was effectively less than he had made when he was first mayor. At 50 and mulling another crapshoot of a congressional bid, he fretted. \u201cAt Hamilton,\u201d Steve Rosenfeld, his 1990 press secretary, said, \u201cBernie would often confide in Dennis, saying he was worried about his professional future and financial security.\u201d (Gilbert told me he doesn\u2019t recall this.)\n\nSanders and his wife responded by pooling resources. Central to their efforts? One of the most reliable ways that millions upon millions of Americans have sought to leverage and improve their financial fortunes: real estate.\n\nIn September 1988, according to local property records, Jane Sanders changed the house she owned on Isham Street to a house they owned\u2014kicking off a spate of activity and shifting legally from \u201csole owner\u201d to \u201cJane O\u2019Meara Sanders and Bernard Sanders, husband and wife, as tenants by the entirety.\u201d Just two days later, they used the house to take out a mortgage of $50,000. The following February, according to a three-line recording of the transaction in the Burlington Free Press, Sanders sold the house he had bought in 1983 with a $49,500 mortgage for $82,000\u2014a fine return on that first investment. Not quite three months later, leaving the more urban portion of Burlington and moving to a neighborhood closer to picturesque Lake Champlain, Bernie and Jane Sanders got a $140,000 mortgage to purchase for $175,500 a three-bedroom, two-bathroom, not-quite-1,600-square-foot house on Killarney Drive\u2014\u201ca red-paneled, boxy, split-level house,\u201d as Rosenfeld would describe it, \u201cthat could be in any middle-class suburb in America.\u201d Barely more than a month after that, they sold the house on Isham for $135,000.\n\nOn his book, Our Revolution, Sanders made $880,091.14 in 2017.

In the aftermath of his victory, he was a mixture of exultant and indignant. \u201cI\u2019m not an insider,\u201d he said. \u201cI know who I am. I know where I came from. I don\u2019t need to get down on my knees and ask rich people for help.\u201d After having excoriated members of Congress for voting to give themselves pay raises two years earlier\u2014\u201cquite beyond comprehension,\u201d he huffed in a letter to the three members of Vermont\u2019s congressional delegation that he had made public as a mayoral news release\u2014Sanders started making considerably more than he had ever earned: $125,100 a year.\n\nIn the first half of the '90s, though\u2014as the crotchety independent butted heads with Democrats in Washington while navigating the topsy-turvy political terrain of the time and as the election of Bill Clinton spawned the rise of increasingly virulent, Newt Gingrich-led hyperpartisanship\u2014Sanders\u2019 prospects were far from ensured. And he used his house to hedge his bets. He signed over power of attorney to his wife, and they refinanced their home in 1991 and again in 1993, both times with mortgages larger than the one they had agreed to in 1989\u2014$140,500 in '91, $145,600 in '93.\n\nSanders settled in, though, as a more and more fixed political presence in Vermont. His race in 1994 was the last one he could have lost, really, as he cemented his status and security.\n\nIn 2000, with a real estate boom underway, and with a mortgage of $62,100, he and his wife bought in essence their first second home\u2014a condominium in Burlington, which they initially bought for Jane Sanders\u2019 elderly mother, according to Weaver, and used intermittently as a place for extended family or a rental property.\n\nIn 2004, Jane Sanders was hired as the president of Burlington College, a small, middling liberal arts school. Making a six-figure salary, she saw her tenure end in acrimony after her decision to pursue a campus expansion by making a $10 million land purchase crippled the institution. She resigned in 2014 and took with her a $200,000 severance package some called a golden parachute. In 2016, the debt-beset college closed for good, felled by \u201can inexperienced president,\u201d in the barbed words of Jane Sanders\u2019 successor.\n\nIn the meantime, Bernie Sanders\u2019 career was heading in the opposite direction: up. In 2006, he was elected to the Senate. At the top of a surging real estate market in 2007, with his congressional salary at $165,200, Sanders bought a row home in Washington for $489,000, adding to the condo and house on Killarney and quietly climbing some financial stair steps when far fewer people were paying him any attention.\n\nAnd in 2009, when the markets were crashing and half of the 100 senators were still worth a million dollars or more, Sanders\u2019 estimated net worth clocked in at $105,000, according to the Center for Responsive Politics\u2014at the bottom of the Senate wealth chart. In Burlington, Bernie and Jane Sanders returned to real estate, using a mortgage of $324,000 to purchase a $405,000 upgrade: a four-bedroom, 2,352-square-foot house sitting atop a slow slope of a hill up from the street on Van Patten Parkway. (They bought the house, interestingly, from her son, David Driscoll, and his wife. In 2012, for $265,000, Driscoll and his wife bought from Jane and Bernie Sanders the Killarney house. Effectively, they swapped houses. Driscoll, Weaver said, wanted to live in \u201chis childhood home.\u201d) In 2013, Bernie and Jane Sanders refinanced the Van Patten house, taking out a mortgage of $312,275.\n\nAnd in 2015, when he started running for president, he had a net worth of a little more than $700,000, according to CRP calculations, a financial picture that had all his assets in his wife\u2019s name and liabilities from a pair of mortgages as well as credit card debt listed as between $25,002 and $65,000. It made him, a spokesman said at the time, \u201ca regular American.\u201d More \u201cregular,\u201d perhaps, than he should have been: According to the Federal Reserve, the average household in 2015 had credit card debt of about $10,000.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Sanders said during his 2016 presidential campaign, using the same effacing opening clause and striking the same tone that he had in his financial disclosure of 40 years before, \u201cI remain one of the poorer members of the United States Senate.\u201d\n\nBut for the politics he practiced\u2014always\u2014it was a useful note to sound.\n\nHe all but compared his finances to those of front-running Hillary Clinton, she of the high-dollar speaking fees. \u201cThat type of wealth,\u201d he said, \u201chas the potential to isolate you from the reality of the world.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before unprecedented money for Sanders started rolling in.\n\n\n\n***\n\nDriving from address to address, I recently made a quick self-guided tour of Sanders\u2019 sequence of houses in the Queen City of Vermont, tracing from Catherine to Isham to Killarney to Van Patten the almost 40 years of the socialist\u2019s slow climb to the upper class. I stared at his car, a red 2010 Chevrolet Aveo, parked in his driveway.\n\nThen, though, I carried on an hour so north, to bucolic North Hero, some 20 miles south of the Canadian border, to see the emblem of the economic altitude to which Sanders has ascended\u2014the third house, the summer house, the house with rustic wood sides, a silver-colored tin roof, four bedrooms and 500 feet of waterfront that Bernie and Jane Sanders bought for $575,000, cash, through an entity they created called the Islands Trust. \u201cJane\u2019s idea was to have something that would stay in the family,\u201d Weaver told me, \u201cover generations, and that sort of structure was the way to help accomplish that.\u201d\n\nPast horses and silos and campsites and apple farms, it\u2019s nestled at the end of a gravel private lane, hidden behind a cluster of evergreens, looking out over the wide, resplendent blue of Lake Champlain.\n\nMuch has changed in these past four years. In 2015, Sanders had that credit card debt and two mortgages that ranged from $250,001 to $500,000, according to his Senate financial disclosure of that year. In 2016, the credit card debt was gone, and one of those mortgages had been halved. By 2018, only one of the mortgages remained; that January, records show, he paid off what was left of the $312,275 mortgage he had on his main house in Vermont.\n\nIn 2015, he published a book called The Speech, basically a transcript of his memorable 2010 filibuster on (what else?) corporate greed, income inequality and the decline of the middle class. Sanders made $3,035, which he donated to charity. In 2016, though, book money began to pile up. He got a $795,000 advance to write Our Revolution. He pocketed an additional $70,484 in royalties. In 2017, the book royalties added up to $880,091.14. And last year, while they dipped, they still were a hunk of money: $392,810.37.\n\nThe Sanders\u2019 tax returns, too, tell the tale: From 2015 to 2018, their total income went from $240,622 to $1,073,333 to $1,150,891 to $566,421. Some of that, along with money from a retirement account, according to Jane Sanders, and proceeds from a sale of a share of a family home of hers, helped pay for the lake house that I sat and looked at while listening to birds chirp in the chill of spring in the northern reaches of New England.\n\n\u201cBernie is a known quantity in any socialist paradise,\u201d GOP consultant Rick Wilson told me, \u201cthe party apparatchik with the dacha ...\u201d\n\nThis kind of characterization makes Sanders\u2019 friends and others who\u2019ve known him for years all but roll their eyes.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s still the same cranky guy,\u201d said Terje Anderson, chairman of the Vermont Democratic Party. \u201cI run into him at Hannaford shopping for groceries.\u201d\n\nAnd in his cart, I asked, aren\u2019t the finest meats and cheeses?\n\n\u201cHell no,\u201d Anderson said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no change,\u201d Niedweske added. \u201cHis priorities remain the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, I don\u2019t think any of Bernie\u2019s supporters said, \u2018Oh, well, now that he\u2019s made a lot of money selling a book \u2026 I can\u2019t support him anymore,\u2019\u201d Terry Bouricius, a former Burlington city councilor and progressive who\u2019s known Sanders since the '70s, told me. \u201cNo\u2014I don\u2019t think that happened to anybody.\u201d\n\nA spectrum of politicos I talked to don\u2019t think this is that big of a political problem for Sanders. He has problems, they said, that are bigger than his bottom line\u2014his persistent lack of appeal to female voters and black voters, for instance, and his generally sagging poll numbers ever since an evidently formidable Joe Biden entered the race, and the slap-in-the-face mathematical fact that this time around he\u2019s running against not Hillary Clinton but 20-plus Democrats. He is, in other words, no longer the beneficiary of the anybody-but-her voters.\n\n\u201cThe least of his problems,\u201d Marsh, the Democratic strategist from Boston, said of Sanders' wealth.\n\n\u201cDetractors will needle and pester and continue to push that argument,\u201d said Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist who\u2019s been working on presidential campaigns for almost 40 years. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think in the end it\u2019s going to have much impact.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the list of stuff that bothers me about Bernie,\u201d said Stuart Stevens, a GOP consultant who was the chief strategist for Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 run, \u201cthe fact that he wrote a book and made some money doesn\u2019t bother me at all.\u201d\n\nDitto Democrat Bakari Sellers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to sit here and shit on Bernie Sanders for being a millionaire,\u201d the former South Carolina lawmaker and current Kamala Harris supporter told me.\n\nWhy not?\n\n\u201cI want to be a millionaire, too!\u201d",
