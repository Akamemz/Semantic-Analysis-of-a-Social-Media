That would get him into some deep doo-doo with his bosses at the Washington Post . So , given the fairly general and bipartisan kudos for Trump \u2019 s strike on one of Assad \u2019 s air bases last Thursday , what \u2019 s an eager-to-please , up-and-coming reporter to do ?\nKinda hard , when Obama did nothing , except lie about how he got rid of Assad \u2019 s chemical weapons . But for Rogin , that \u2019 s not a problem . All he had to do was compare President Trump \u2019 s very real attack with then-President Barack Obama \u2019 s imagined one . The one that was going to be really , really , big , if only he had done something .\n\u201c What we had in mind in 2013 had many more targets and was much more expansive , \u201d Rogin quotes one of his many anonymous sources in the Obama administration as saying . Obama \u2019 s plan was to strike six installations , and that would have been five more than the one that Trump actually did strike .\nBut , alas , Senator Graham told Rogin , \u201c Obama changed his mind at the last minute and ended up not striking Syria at all. \u201d Other than that , the two plans were exactly the same , only Obama \u2019 s was bigger and better .\nI love the idea of comparing real actions to imaginary ones . The Beatles were pikers compared to what Barry Manilow coulda done if he had had any talent .\nWorse still , even Obama \u2019 s imaginary actions stunk . He liked to tell his opponents what he would do , before he didn \u2019 t do it . But as Trump kept tweeting in August 2013 , you don \u2019 t announce a surprise attack in advance :\nWhy do we keep broadcasting when we are going to attack Syria . Why can \u2019 t we just be quiet and , if we attack at all , catch them by surprise ? @ walaa_3ssaf No , dopey , I would not go into Syria , but if I did it would be by surprise and not blurted all over the media like fools . If we are going to continue to be stupid and go into Syria ( watch Russia ) , as they say in the movies , SHOOT FIRST AND TALK LATER !\nDeclaring your intention to attack with great fanfare detracts from the shock and awe element that carries with it a substantial psychological effect that can be equal to or greater than any physical consequences .\nEspecially when your secretary of state follows up the threat with a promise that the strikes would be \u201c unbelievably small . \u201d\nHow can I explain this in a way that would be both effective and delicate ? Suppose a man calls his wife from work to arrange a special date night . \u201c Drop the kids off at your mother \u2019 s , \u201d he suggests in his most seductive voice . \u201c I \u2019 m planning something very special . But it will be unbelievably short. \u201d Whatever happens after this is bound to be singularly underwhelming .\nNow imagine this . The husband says nothing of his plans . He arrives home . His beloved is rinsing the lettuce for the salad . He comes up behind her , puts his arms around her , and begins to nuzzle her neck . Whatever happens after this is bound to be singularly spectacular .\nThe element of surprise is a force multiplier . Like a hammer or a dozen roses . It amplifies a small input into a large output .\nThe only reason you \u2019 d announce an intention to strike , militarily or romantically , is if the planned event were truly going to be huge . That \u2019 s because the psychological element of anticipation would then work to your benefit . Anticipation can inspire a frisson of pleasant excitement or intense fear .\nFirst , his objective was limited . He wasn \u2019 t after an immediate regime change , for there \u2019 s no one yet who \u2019 s ready to step into Assad \u2019 s shoes and keep Syria from turning into a Libya .\nSecond , it made clear that the new sheriff in town was a doer not a talker . This is no Obama who , even after eight years of planning , couldn \u2019 t come up with a plan for Syria that he was ready to implement . As I suggested in an article I wrote for The \u2588\u2588\u2588 in August 2015 , Donald Trump is a man who has the makings of an archetypal American Hero . I compared him to John Wayne in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence and to the three Americans who instinctively sprang into action when a Moroccan jihadist started shooting on a packed train traveling from Amsterdam to Paris and took him out with his own rifle .\nThird , it established that America was still in touch with the principles that had moved its Founders and , moreover , had the power and the will to act upon them .

And so , the day before the strike , the administration announced that Secretary of State Tillerson would be visiting Moscow to meet with Vladimir Putin the following week . It is not unreasonable to think that Mr. Putin has been anticipating Tillerson \u2019 s visit with more than a bit of apprehension . His future depends on the outcome of this meeting .\nPutin doesn \u2019 t see himself as a barbarian . In fact , he considers that he \u2019 s the only remaining defender of Western civilization .

Two of them \u2014 One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich and The Gulag Archipelago \u2014 describe the inhumane treatment of prisoners under the Soviets . The third , Matryona \u2019 s House , is about a woman who struggles to reconcile her deep Christian beliefs with the communist reality under which she lives .\nYet , today , most of the civilized world believes that Putin is at least partly responsible for the barbaric gassing of Syrian civilians .
