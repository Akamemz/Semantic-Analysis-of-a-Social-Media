Pete King of New York on Wednesday afternoon after a meeting with Boehner and Majority Leader Eric Cantor in which GOP leaders pledged to allow a Friday vote on $ 9 billion in aid for victims of the record-breaking storm.A second vote on the remaining $ 51 million will come on Jan. 15 . \u201c The bottom line is we need the $ 60 billion , \u201d King said . \u201c We have gotten that solid commitment. \u201d Earlier Wednesday , King and several other members of the New York-New Jersey congressional delegation had hurled angry words at Boehner for not allowing a vote on the aid to come to the House floor.But King said later that his anger at Boehner was now in the past. \u201c As far as I \u2019 m concerned that was a lifetime ago , \u201d he said after the meeting with Boehner and Cantor , the Hill reports . \u201c The bottom line is we are getting the result that we need. \u201d Ron Meyer , a spokesman for the conservative group American Majority Action , which was among several calling for Boehner \u2019 s ouster , acknowledged that House Republicans simply do not have a viable alternative to Boehner. \u201c It turns out no one else seems willing to pick up the mantle , \u201d he said on Wednesday . \u201c I hesitate to say it , but this goes to some degree to cowardice. \u201d \u201c You can \u2019 t beat somebody with nobody , \u201d added a senior House Republican to the National Journal on Wednesday.Boehner \u2019 s speakership seems all but certain to survive several challenges in recent months.Two weeks ago , for instance , dozens of GOP legislators refused to support Boehner \u2019 s \u201c Plan B \u201d fiscal-cliff proposal that would have staved off rising tax rates for most Americans.The party split capped an extensive day of lobbying and arm-twisting of the GOP rank and file , which included a late-night meeting Boehner called to determine whether he had enough votes for approval.That not being the case , Majority Leader Cantor announced that no vote would be held \u2014 and Boehner himself was spotted leaving the Capitol shortly thereafter.Much of the criticism centered around conservative GOP legislators and outside groups seeing Boehner as too willing to compromise with the White House and Democrats on taxes and other fiscal issues.And last month , Boehner stripped four Republicans \u2014 including three heavily supported by the Tea Party Patriots \u2014 from their coveted committee seats .
