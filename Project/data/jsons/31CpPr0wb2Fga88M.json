    "content": "By any measure , the nearly-six-year tenure of Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. has been one of the most consequential in United States history . His decision to resign , which he announced on Thursday , was long anticipated ; he has said he will stay on through his successor \u2019 s confirmation . It is hard to imagine that anyone who could make it through the current Senate would have an impact comparable to Mr. Holder \u2019 s .\nAs the first African-American to serve as the nation \u2019 s top law enforcement official , Mr. Holder broke ground the moment he took office . In a position that rarely rewards boldness \u2014 and in the face of a frequently hostile Congress \u2014 Mr. Holder has continued to stake out strong and laudable legal positions on many of the most contested issues of our time . But his record is marred by the role the Justice Department played in matters of secrecy and national security under his leadership .\nSAME-SEX MARRIAGE In 2011 , Mr. Holder announced that the Justice Department would no longer defend the Defense of Marriage Act , which defined marriage under federal law as between a man and a woman . The law was unconstitutional , he said . It was a critical moment that foreshadowed both President Obama \u2019 s own \u201c evolution \u201d on same-sex marriage the following year and the Supreme Court \u2019 s 2013 ruling invalidating an important part of the law . Since the court \u2019 s decision , nearly two dozen federal courts have struck down state bans on same-sex marriage throughout the country , and the Supreme Court has been asked again to rule on whether there is a constitutional right to same-sex marriage \u2014 a question it dodged in 2013 .\nVOTING RIGHTS Mr. Holder successfully fought discriminatory voting restrictions around the country before the 2012 elections . When the Supreme Court gutted the core of the Voting Rights Act in 2013 , he was quick to find new ways to challenge discriminatory laws . Shortly after the ruling , the Justice Department joined lawsuits challenging new restrictions like strict voter-ID requirements and cutbacks to voting hours in North Carolina and Texas . In both states , Republican-controlled legislatures imposed rules that most heavily burden poorer and minority voters , who tend to vote Democratic .",
