As one Times reader put it , \u201c There \u2019 s too much at stake in this election for the media to stoke the belief that Hillary \u2019 s mistakes ( which she has definitely made ) are even close to par with Trump \u2019 s . \u201d\nWhen Times public editor Liz Spayd essentially told readers that her paper was just doing its job and that readers should just suck it up and deal , she was hit with a torrent of criticism .\nA pack of pundits \u2013 one might call them the false-equivalency priesthood \u2013 lashed out through pieces like \u201c Why the Media Is Botching the Election , \u201d \u201c Media Should Stop Treating Trump and Clinton as Equals , \u201d \u201c Does the New York Times Have a False Balance Problem ? \u201d and countless others .\n1 ) The people complaining about \u201c false balance \u201d usually seem confident in having discovered the truth of things for themselves , despite the media \u2019 s supposed incompetence . They \u2019 re quite sure of whom to vote for and why . Their complaints are really about the impact that \u201c false balance \u201d coverage might have on other , lesser humans , with weaker minds than theirs . Which is not just snobbish , but laughably snobbish . So , shut up .\n2 ) One of the main reasons the news media has been dumbed down over the years is because audiences have consistently rejected smart , responsible journalism in favor of clickbait stupidities like \u201c Five Things You Didn \u2019 t Know About John McCain \u2019 s Penis \u201d and \u201c Woman Strips Naked in Front of Police Officers . You Won \u2019 t Believe What Happened Next. \u201d The Bachelor and Toddlers and Tiaras crush Frontline . And people wonder why Donald Trump gets a lot of coverage ?\nNo doubt about it , the country is in a brutal spot right now . We are less than two months from the possibility of one of the dumbest people on the planet winning the White House . And it seems that all anyone \u2019 s talked about this week , whether around the water cooler or on TV news , Twitter or Facebook , is the lung capacity of Hillary Clinton .\nThat sucks . But it \u2019 s not all the media \u2019 s fault . This is classic horse-race stuff , and if you \u2019 re getting it , it \u2019 s at least in part because you spent decades asking for it .\nThe campaign has devolved over time into an entertainment program , a degrading and vicious show where the contestants win the nuclear launch codes instead of a date with a millionaire .\nUnder the rules of this reality series which media consumers turn into a gigantic hit every four years , collapsing in front of a cell-phone camera at a 9/11 memorial service is more important than a dozen position papers .\nIt just is . You proved it when you clicked on that video of the episode last weekend and didn \u2019 t read a compare-and-contrast piece on , for instance , the candidates \u2019 banking policies .\nTrump himself is feeling the business end of that dynamic right now , having just reversed himself on the birther question in spectacular fashion . His \u201c Yes , Obama was born in America , but Hillary started the birther controversy and I ended it \u201d routine is dumb enough and full of enough lies to keep reporters busy for a good news cycle or so , until the next fiasco .\nAn important news story or 10 will likely die on the vine while the country obsesses over Trump \u2019 s latest foot-in-mouth episode . That \u2019 s the paradox with this candidate . Even the people who wish he didn \u2019 t exist can \u2019 t take their eyes off him . No amount of \u201c contextualizing \u201d or pointing out his flaws and deceptions can walk back his gravitational pull on audiences .\nThis is true of a lot of dumb things that take up space in the news pages , from Joe Arpaio to the Kardashians . One could argue that the users of the public \u2019 s airwaves have a higher responsibility to properly inform the public that outweighs the need to chase ratings and give airtime to clown acts , but that ship sailed a long time ago .\nAsk any reporter who \u2019 s tried to make the news less stupid at any time over the past 40 years . Most of those people end up begging ProPublica for lunch money , while the horse-racers and celebrity-humpers get panel shows .\nAsk reporters like Juan Carlos Frey , who struggled to get anyone to pay attention when he reported on mass graves of undocumented immigrants discovered along the border of Texas .\nSuch stories about the mass deaths of foreigners or minorities usually get less ink than a cat stuck in a tree or a model who falls off a runway .\nBut lack of \u201c balance \u201d doesn \u2019 t seem to bother too many people in that instance . It only seems to come up when the victim is a major political party with basically unlimited ability to buy its own publicity .\nMedia consumers voting with their eyeballs for ever-dumber political coverage creates the biggest imbalance in reality , but the \u201c false equivalency \u201d debate is mostly over a separate , more parochial issue of journalistic ethics .\nThe essence of that debate is whether or not it \u2019 s appropriate to write negative things about Hillary Clinton when there \u2019 s a possibility that Donald Trump might become president . Or , rather , we may say negative things about Clinton , but only if we always drape reporting in plenty of context about the worse-ness of Trump , or something .\nThere \u2019 s not much to say about this debate apart from the fact that it \u2019 s phony and absurd and that the people shrieking for \u201c balance \u201d are almost always at heart censors who are really concerned with keeping a view of the world with which they disagree out of the news .\nThere are two basic ideas of how the press is supposed to operate . One is that the system works best when reporters are free , independent and annoying , giving the public as much information as possible , so that people may sort things out for themselves .\nThe other is that information is inherently dangerous , and the public is too stupid to be trusted with too much of it . Throughout history there has always been a plurality of people who will believe this .\nWhether it \u2019 s keeping \u201c Fuck the Police \u201d off the airwaves or news of the collectivist famine out of Pravda , the idea is the same : People can \u2019 t handle stuff .\nThe giveaway in this latest \u201c false balance \u201d debate is the language . There are people wailing about a \u201c weaponized \u201d media that just this once needs to be leashed a bit , given the circumstances . This is classic \u201c information is dangerous \u201d rhetoric .\nThere are even people in our business using this high-pressure situation to argue for less access and transparency , in the name of keeping future generations of politicians safe from the prying eyes of the public ! Most reporters view their jobs as being basically the opposite of that .\nIn truth , the media landscape is massive and there \u2019 s room to cover everything . It \u2019 s worth noting that the exploration of Trump \u2019 s iniquities and unfitness for office in the last year has been truly awesome , both in terms of raw volume and vehemence of tone .\nAnyone who tries to argue that there \u2019 s insufficiently vast documentation of Trump \u2019 s insanity is either being willfully obtuse or not paying real attention to the news . Just follow this latest birther faceplant . The outrage is all out there , in huge quantities .
