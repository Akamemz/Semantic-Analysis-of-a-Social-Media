    "content": "Others argue that \u201c Biden was almost the only one on the stage who talked like a normal person . There was a point near the end of the debate when he was talking about getting men involved in stopping domestic violence and he said that we need to keep \u2018 punching \u2019 at it\u2026 I knew that the twitterati and the analysts would tut tut . Ol \u2019 Joe is just out of touch ! He doesn \u2019 t know you can \u2019 t use words like that . Meanwhile , every non-political junkie watching the debate thought there was nothing wrong with this . Biden was just using ordinary language , not worrying too much if it was fully approved by the woke brigade. \u201d Kevin Drum , Mother Jones\nRegarding Biden , many note that \u201c Something about [ his ] Iowa presence feels soft , and his rival campaigns certainly feel it . His crowds can \u2019 t match those of his top rivals ; he \u2019 s having trouble filling his precinct captain slots ; he \u2019 s had to rely on paid canvassers rather than volunteers to knock on doors . His team is pitching schemes with other , less-viable candidates\u2026 perhaps this is another episode of the cyclelong pundit error of anticipating doom for Biden . But his campaign is giving off scrambling vibes. \u201d Jim Newell , Slate\nRegarding the Democratic Party \u2019 s messaging , some note that \u201c Sanders seldom talks specifically to nonwhite voters . His message to them is the same as his message to everyone : universal health coverage and student-debt relief , more redistribution from rich to poor , reducing the power of money in politics . The latest CNN poll showed Sanders erasing Biden \u2019 s lead among nonwhite voters\u2014perhaps in spite of Sanders \u2019 s indifference to identity politics , or maybe , just maybe , because of that indifference\u2026 \u201c There are many ways to divide the Democratic field : by ideology , by gender , by ethnicity , by age . But perhaps the most important is this : For Buttigieg , for Bloomberg , as for me and very likely for you , reader of The Atlantic , one of the most decisive days of our lives was the day we received the fat envelope of acceptance from a selective educational institution . Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden speak to Americans for whom the fat-envelope/thin-envelope decision means little , if it means anything at all . It \u2019 s not accident or name recognition that explains why they lead the field . They are both being carried by something big and real . The challenge for the person who will succeed in beating Trump in 2020 is not merely to ride that force , but to guide it. \u201d David Frum , The Atlantic\nCritics of Sanders write , \u201c Give Sanders credit for moving public opinion along on a living wage , higher taxes on the rich and the need for immediate action to stem the immolation of the planet . Most great ideas start on the fringe and move to the middle\u2026 [ But ] just 39 percent of Americans view socialism positively , a bare uptick from 2010 , compared with 87 percent who have a positive view of free enterprise , Gallup found last fall . What \u2019 s more , American confidence in the economy is now at the highest level in nearly two decades . That \u2019 s hardly the best condition for overthrowing the system\u2026 \u201c The United States has never been a socialist country , even when it most likely should have been one , during the robber baron tyranny of the Gilded Age or the desperation of the Great Depression , and it never will be\u2026 Bernie Sanders can \u2019 t win. \u201d Timothy Egan , New York Times\n\u201c If Sanders actually does win both [ Iowa and New Hampshire ] , then the more mainstream wing of the Democratic Party may indeed go into full flip-out , panic-room mode , as advertised , and unleash its lab-grown clone hybrid of Biden , Hillary Clinton and Mike Bloomberg . But anything less than that \u2014 and perhaps even a narrow victory in one or the other state , accompanied by a \u2018 surprisingly strong \u2019 result by someone else \u2014 and you can expect to hear a lot of chatter about how the \u2018 Bernie boomlet \u2019 that absolutely nobody predicted is now over , and the natural order of politics that has conclusively been proven to no longer exist is reasserting itself\u2026 \u201c As Dave Weigel of the Washington post recently observed on Twitter , you have to wonder about the viability of a political party that sleeps on the same outsider candidate two cycles in a row . \u201d Andrew O'Hehir , Salon\nSupporters of Sanders posit that \u201c In Iowa , a vote for Warren is a vote for Biden\u2026 To prevent a Biden nomination , the time [ for progressives ] to unite is now . Warren had a chance : Sanders amassed more volunteers , got more donations and is doing substantially better in the polls . Now that the actual voting is starting , progressives can not afford to split their bloc . They need to unify behind Sanders \u2026 We have an unprecedented opportunity to throw [ Trump ] out and replace him with something far , far better . How tragic would it be if that opportunity was destroyed because some clung to a losing candidate , dividing the movement and squandering precious votes ? \u201d Nathan Robinson , The Guardian\n\u201c The Democratic Party is a collection of diverse groups \u2014 young people , liberal whites , conservative-leaning African Americans and Latinos , non-religious Americans , city-dwellers , and so on . By contrast , Iowa \u2019 s population is roughly 90 percent white , uncommonly old , and heavily rural . In other words , it doesn \u2019 t really look like America and isn \u2019 t representative of the Democratic base . And yet a 2007 study found that a voter in Iowa or New Hampshire ( where the first primary is held ) has about 20 times more influence than someone who votes in a later primary . That doesn \u2019 t seem fair by any standard. \u201d Sean Illing , Vox\n\u201c The best argument for the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire and even South Carolina primaries , is that most of their campaign settings are focused on meeting candidates one-on-one\u2026 while most candidates for president are typically comfortable raising money at donors \u2019 favorite wine caves , I \u2019 d argue that forcing them to share Jello salad with caucus attenders from Sioux City , or Apple Wine with voters from Franconia -- voters who otherwise won \u2019 t get near the occupant of the Oval Office \u2013 is a necessary obstacle to throw in their way\u2026\n\u201c [ Furthermore ] Iowa , New Hampshire , and even South Carolina provide the few opportunities for a candidate with a compelling message , but limited access to the money required to campaign nationally , to build a following and make a success of their campaign\u2026 In a political campaign that skips small states and starts either with large states , or regional primaries , the only candidates who will emerge will be incumbents or those who can arrive at the starting gate with access to the hundreds of millions of dollars that a modern national campaign requires . That \u2019 s why Iowa is important and will always matter . \u201d\n\u201c Sanders wins in Iowa and New Hampshire would make him hard to stop . Biden \u2019 s current national and Nevada poll leads could vanish overnight . His candidacy would depend on heavy support from blacks in the Deep South and industrial north . Democratic professionals who fear that Sanders \u2019 liabilities \u2014 age , socialism \u2014 are too much to overcome may find it as difficult to defeat him as their Republican equivalents found it difficult to stop Donald Trump four years ago . Or as difficult as it was for Britain \u2019 s New Labour establishment to stop the left-wing Jeremy Corbyn from leading the party to a record defeat last month . \u201d\n\u201c Bernie has a large , dedicated , loyal following , especially among Millennials , and tens of thousands more small-dollar donors than any other Democratic candidate . He is flush with cash . He has a radical agenda that appeals to the ideological left and the idealistic young . The rising star of the party , Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , is campaigning alongside him . And say what you will , Sanders is no trimmer or time-server . He has consistently voted his values and views . He voted no to Bush 41 \u2019 s Gulf War , no to Bush 43 \u2019 s Iraq War , no to NAFTA , no to GATT\u2026\n\u201c If\u2026 Bernie \u2019 s last chance at the nomination is aborted by an establishment piling on , party super PACs running attack ads against him , and major media taking time out from trashing Trump to break Sanders , the Democratic Party will have the devil \u2019 s time of it bringing Bernie \u2019 s backers home in the fall . Bernie \u2019 s believers might just conclude that the real obstacle to their dream of remaking America is neither the radical right nor Donald Trump , but the elites within their own party . \u201d\nSome argue , \u201c I don \u2019 t think Bernie is the Democrats \u2019 most formidable general election challenger , but I think he can win\u2026 every single factor that caused reluctant Republicans to hold their noses and vote for Trump will apply to reluctant Democrats . \u2018 Binary choice , \u2019 they \u2019 ll hear . \u2018 Judges , \u2019 they \u2019 ll declare . And , unlike 2016 , when a host of people on both sides of the aisle thought there was no way that Hillary Clinton would lose to Donald Trump , not a single member of the Democratic coalition will be complacent\u2026\n\u201c We \u2019 ve reached a point in our national polarization when both parties can nominate previously unthinkable candidates and still enter the general election with a real chance for a win . Primary voters rule American politics , and the lesson many of them have learned from the last three presidential elections is clear\u2014compromise loses . Devotion wins . And of all the Democratic candidates in the field , nobody inspires devotion quite like Bernie Sanders . \u201d\nTorYet \u201c Looming over them all is a candidate not even running in Iowa \u2013 Mike Bloomberg , the multibillionaire former New York City mayor . Bloomberg has focused his campaign on the 14 states that hold nominating contests on Super Tuesday , March 3 \u2013 including delegate-rich California and Texas\u2026 To win the Democratic presidential nomination at the party \u2019 s national convention on the first ballot a candidate will need 1,990 delegates . Voters in the Iowa caucuses will select 41 Democratic delegates . But that \u2019 s a tiny number compared to the 1,357 delegates who will be selected by voters on Super Tuesday in the 14 states , plus American Samoa and Democrats abroad\u2026\n\u201c If Biden performs poorly in the first four nominating contests \u2013 in Iowa , New Hampshire , South Carolina and Nevada \u2013 expect moderate Democrats to turn to Bloomberg to keep Sanders from winning the nomination . \u201d\n\u201c If a dozen drones or missiles can do the kind of damage to the world economy as did those fired on Saturday\u2014shutting down about 6 percent of world oil production\u2014imagine what a U.S.-Iran-Saudi war would do to the world economy . In recent decades , the U.S. has sold the Saudis hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment . Did our weapons sales carry a guarantee that we will also come and fight alongside the kingdom if it gets into a war with its neighbors ? \u2026 the nation does not want another war . How we avoid it , however , is becoming difficult to see . John Bolton may be gone from the West Wing , but his soul is marching on . \u201d\nOthers note , \u201c I \u2019 d hate to be a Democratic member of Congress trying to convince Joe Sixpack that this is a whole new ballgame . The transcript shows Trump being Trump and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky trying to ingratiate himself with the big dog by , for instance , mentioning that he stays at Trump hotels . Trump \u2019 s conversation is typically scattershot , wandering all over the field , leaving a reasonable listener puzzled about what the takeaways are supposed to be\u2026 \u200d \u201c I think Joe Sixpack \u2019 s response is going to be a hearty shrug . After all that has emerged about Trump so far , his approval rating is closely tracking Obama \u2019 s approval at the same point in his presidency . To get Mr. Sixpack \u2019 s attention you are going to have to do better than this . \u201d",
