    "content": "NEWTOWN , Conn. \u2014 In the center of town , this tight-knit community \u2019 s Christmas tree has become a heartbreaking memorial to innocent children taken by a killer .\nCandles and hundreds of stuffed animals , along with handwritten signs bearing messages of sympathy , now surround the tree . On Sunday night , thousands stopped to pay their respects to the victims of one of the worst tragedies in American history .\nWhen local police Officer Luke Ramirez first heard of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday , his thoughts immediately turned to his 8-year-old son , a third-grade student at the school . As one of the first responders charged with confronting the grisly scene inside and with hunting for the cold-blooded shooter Adam Lanza , Officer Ramirez did his job . But fear for his son \u2019 s safety eventually got the better of him .\n\u201c I kind of broke down . Everything just went blank to me , \u201d Officer Ramirez said as he held back tears , staring past the throngs of people toward the tree , where the makeshift memorial grew in size with each passing minute . \u201c It was the worst feeling ever . \u201d\nOfficer Ramirez was one of the lucky ones . His son escaped unharmed . Many other families endured a much different outcome , and they \u2019 re struggling to cope with the sadness and despair that has enveloped Newtown and brought an entire nation into mourning .\nHundreds of the grief-stricken streamed into the community high school Sunday night to hear President Obama and local religious leaders honor the 20 students and six adults killed in the school rampage and offer words of compassion . Hours before the vigil began , mourners lined up outside the building , many covered with white blankets provided by the American Red Cross to shield them from Sunday night \u2019 s stinging rain and frigid temperatures .\n\u201c I come to offer the love and prayers of a nation . I am very mindful that mere words can not match the depth of your sorrow , nor can they heal your wounded hearts , \u201d Mr. Obama said . \u201c We have wept with you . \u2026 Whatever portion of sadness that we can share with you to ease this heavy load , we will gladly bear it . \u201d\nThe president not only spoke words of comfort , but offered a heartfelt , emotional plea to the nation and its leaders to take real , lasting steps to prevent another tragedy on the scale seen in Newtown , in Aurora , Colo. , in Oak Creek , Wis. , and in other towns where gunmen have brought death and destruction to peaceful communities .\n\u201c Can we truly say , as a nation , that we are meeting our obligations ? Can we honestly say that we are doing enough to keep our children \u2014 all of them \u2014 safe from harm ? \u201d Mr. Obama said , asking if the nation is doing enough to give all children a chance at a good life with \u201c happiness and with purpose . \u201d\n\u201c If we are honest with ourselves , the answer is no , \u201d he said . \u201c We are not doing enough , and we will have to change . \u201d\nThe Sunday night ceremony capped off another gut-wrenching day in Newtown \u2014 a day in which thousands sought refuge in houses of worship , flocking to local churches to comfort one another and hear messages of encouragement , hope and love from local priests , pastors and rabbis .\nSt. Rose of Lima Roman Catholic Church had to be evacuated during Sunday morning Mass , with officials reporting that someone phoned in a \u201c threat of violence. \u201d It was yet another blow to the people of Newtown , but after Friday \u2019 s shooting , the parishioners at St. Rose took it in stride .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think any of us could be surprised about anything after what happened \u201d at Sandy Hook , said Brian Wallace , spokesman for the Catholic Diocese of Bridgeport , Conn . He added that the people inside St. Rose evacuated the building without panic and comforted one another outside the church .\nDespite the threat \u2014 which is still under investigation \u2014 St. Rose and other Newtown churches are playing an important role in the healing process , though ministers also found themselves at a loss to explain Friday \u2019 s massacre .\nFrom behind his pulpit on Sunday morning , the Rev . Parker Reardon , pastor of the small Newtown Bible Church on the outskirts of town , paused for a moment during his sermon , looking out toward his congregation as members embraced one another and fought off the urge to weep .\n\u201c I haven \u2019 t gotten a lot of sleep the past few nights . I can \u2019 t even remember if we \u2019 ve already prayed . If we have , then we \u2019 ll pray again , \u201d he said , again leading the churchgoers in prayer only minutes after already doing so at the beginning of his remarks .\nLike others in this affluent community , Mr. Reardon flatly admitted , \u201c I don \u2019 t know what to say , \u201d echoing the sentiments of others still unable to fully explain Friday \u2019 s events .\nNewtown \u2019 s pastors understood that , on this day , no amount of preparation or study would prepare them for the flood of grief and sadness that would pour through their doors . Those feelings are only beginning to bubble to the surface , 48 hours after the gunman took the lives of 20 young children and six adults at Sandy Hook .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t think today is going to be a regular service , \u201d said the Rev . Jim Orefice , associate pastor at Newtown \u2019 s Connections Church , as churchgoers began filtering in for 10 a.m. service .\nStill shaken from the massacre , Newtown mostly was quiet on Sunday morning , with the exception of those making their way to services .\nAt St. Rose , parishioners stopped at small makeshift memorials just outside the church \u2019 s entrance . Much like downtown \u2019 s Christmas tree tribute , there were not only candles , but also stuffed animals and other reminders of the childhood innocence represented by many of the victims at Sandy Hook , less than two miles from St. Rose .\nHandwritten signs and banners with messages of sympathy increasingly appeared in Newtown over the weekend . As drivers exited Interstate 84 and headed toward the town \u2019 s historic district , they were greeted by a sign with the words \u201c Pray for Newtown . \u201d\nIn the historic district , another hand-drawn message read : \u201c We are a family Newtown . \u201d\nHomes displayed similar messages on their front porches , from windows and on mailboxes . Attendees of Sunday night \u2019 s vigil passed another chilling memorial on the way to Newtown High School , with small angels representing each of the victims erected on the side of the road .\nThe families of the victims have over the past 24 hours begun to speak out and pay tribute to their loved ones . Friday \u2019 s tragedy , already impossible to put into words , has become even more heart-wrenching as photographs of those young victims surface . One such child is Daniel Barden , described by family members as a \u201c constant source of joy and laughter . \u201d\n\u201c Everyone who has ever met Daniel remembers and loves him . Words really can not express what a special boy Daniel was . Such a light . Always smiling , unfailingly polite , incredibly affectionate , fair and so thoughtful towards others , imaginative in play , both intelligent and articulate in conversation , \u201d reads a statement released by Daniel \u2019 s family .\n\u201c He embodied everything that is wholesome and innocent in the world . Our hearts break over losing him and for the many other families suffering loss . We thank our friends , family and the community for their prayers and support that we have received , \u201d they said .\nRobbie Parker , the father of 6-year-old victim Emilie Parker , spoke to reporters on Saturday afternoon and said that \u201c this world is a better place \u201d because his daughter had been in it .\nIn a remarkable moment of compassion , Mr. Parker also offered words of sympathy to the family of the shooter .\n\u201c I can \u2019 t imagine how hard this experience must be for you , and I want you to know that our family and our love and our support goes out to you as well , \u201d he said .\nAs the families dealt with their losses , a few folks still went about their Sunday morning routine , stopping for coffee at a local store and otherwise seeking an escape from the thought of Friday \u2019 s heinous acts and also from the hordes of media now camped out all over town .\nOn Church Hill Road , one of Newtown \u2019 s main junctions and the route from St. Rose to Sandy Hook , retired police Officer Richard Oladovich came to direct traffic on Sunday morning , as he has for years .\nThe 69-year-old , born and raised in the area , struggled to find the words to describe his own feelings , and those of the families he has shared a community with for decades . He came to work as scheduled , using the job as a kind of escape .\n\u201c Everything is quiet here , \u201d he said , taking a break from leading cars into the St. Rose parking . His cold breath was visible as he spoke , and Sunday morning \u2019 s stinging rain pelted his uniform . He recalled his years with the nearby Bethel Police Department , another small town eight miles from Newtown .\nHe expressed sympathy for the victims and their families , and for his comrades in the law enforcement and first-responder community who were greeted at Sandy Hook by a grisly scene difficult to put into words .\n\u201c If I was still on duty , I wouldn \u2019 t believe that scene . It \u2019 s so out of the realm [ of normalcy ] for this area , \u201d he said .\nThe people of Newtown have embarked on the long , difficult road to recovery . Friday \u2019 s tragedy was the last thing they expected , and even now , shock remains the dominant emotion .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not something the people here were mentally prepared for , \u201d said Ricky Andrews , a 24-year-old accountant and lifelong Newtown resident .",
