But he has empowered the agency in other ways \u2014 including allowing its director , not the White House , to make the final decisions about drone strikes in Pakistan .\n\u201c Many presidents tend to be smitten with the instruments of the intelligence community . I think Obama was more smitten than most , \u201d said one former senior Obama administration official , speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified intelligence matters . \u201c This has been an intelligence presidency in a way we haven \u2019 t seen maybe since Eisenhower. \u201d The C.I.A . had shifted from capturing and interrogating terrorism suspects to targeting them with armed drones even before Mr. Obama came to office . It was a tactic championed by Congress at the same time that lawmakers were beginning to criticize the agency \u2019 s detention and interrogation program .\nThe agency carried out its first drone strike in Pakistan in June 2004 , weeks after a draft of a damning C.I.A inspector general report about abuses in the agency \u2019 s secret prisons began circulating in Washington . In the months that followed , the agency began to refashion itself not as a long-term jailer , but as a secret paramilitary force that could kill terrorism suspects with little controversy .\nFor the C.I.A. , there were far fewer political costs associated with killing terrorists than with capturing and interrogating them . There have now been more than 400 drone strikes in Pakistan , according to statistics compiled by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism , and the operations have had broad support among Democrats and Republicans . And the C.I.A . continues to carry out drone strikes in Yemen , despite the Obama administration \u2019 s declared intention in May 2013 that the drone program be transferred to the Pentagon .\nJohn O. Brennan , the C.I.A . director , said during his confirmation hearing in 2013 that he wanted to refocus the agency on traditional missions like espionage and analysis . But the effort has been slow going for a number of reasons . For instance , the congressional intelligence committees have vigorously tried to block transferring drone operations to the Pentagon \u2014 fighting to keep the C.I.A . in control of aspects of the program .\nMr. Johnson , the University of Georgia professor , was the Church Committee staff member who was eating lunch with Mr. Angleton in 1976 when he fulminated against an interfering Congress . In the years since then , he said during a recent interview , he has often met senior C.I.A . leaders who took a dim view of congressional oversight .\nDuring one dinner he had with William J.
