Let's assume they start saving at age 25. The median 25- to 34-year-old man earns $40,000, according to the Education Department, compared with $35,000 for a woman.

A minor differential in your pay right now could make a world of difference between how the two of you fare in retirement.\n\nPaying more throughout life\n\nRetirement isn't the only place this wage gap plays out. Even one year out of college, that woman is earning substantially less than the man \u2014 82 percent of what he earns, according to one 2012 study from the American Association of University Women.
