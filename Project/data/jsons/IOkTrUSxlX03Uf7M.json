I hope you will do it . I hope you will elect her . Those of us who have more yesterdays than tomorrows tend to think more about our children and grandchildren . \u201d\nThe speech capped a pivotal day for the party , as it sought to move on from scenes of division , and capitalise on Clinton \u2019 s symbolic breakthrough .\nShe will address the crowd directly on Thursday in a formal acceptance of the nomination but for now , speeches first from Michelle Obama and now from Bill Clinton have done the most to counter a much darker vision of America presented by Republican candidate Donald Trump .\n\u201c If she wins she \u2019 s coming back for you to take you along on the ride for America \u2019 s future , \u201d said former president Clinton as he recalled campaigning with coalminers in West Virginia and urged to the party to do more to create more new jobs in the US economy .\nIt was almost the only overtly political message of his own . In contrast with past speeches , where the former president has risked overshadowing the campaign , this one sounded more like the personal speeches made by the wives of male candidates .\nIn an azure blue tie that picked out the colours of the arena , and with his hands shaking slightly , Clinton delivered a highly personal account of their courtship and marriage that seemed at times to be an attempt to make America fall in love with the girl he first met in the spring of 1971 .\nSkipping over the awkward moments in a very public , and at times visibly flawed , marriage , Clinton instead said : \u201c I married my best friend , \u201d recalling two failed proposal attempts and then describing when Clinton \u2019 s water broke during her pregnancy with Chelsea \u2013 undoubtedly a first in a speech about a US presidential candidate .\n\u201c The first time I saw her was in a class on political and civil rights \u2026 [ she had ] big blond hair , big glasses , wore no makeup and exuded a sense that I found magnetic , \u201d said a clearly infatuated and somewhat awed Clinton . \u201c I knew I might be starting something I couldn \u2019 t stop . \u201d\nAfter spending nearly an hour describing her political and personal accomplishments he turned only briefly to her opponent . And he issued a direct challenge to the two-dimensional \u201c cartoon \u201d image of his wife which had been painted by her political foes .\n\u201c How does this square with what you heard at the Republican convention ? One is real , the other is made up , \u201d said Bill . \u201c You just have to decide which is which my fellow Americans \u2026 Good for you , because earlier today you nominated the real one . \u201d\nThe well-received speech , seeking to rewrite the accepted wisdom about her candidacy , may help galvanise the campaign in much the same way Bill Clinton helped revive Barack Obama \u2019 s listless 2012 effort .\nBut the space was created by another reconcilation between competing Democrats earlier in the evening .\nBernie Sanders left the arena with his head held high on Tuesday . In contrast to the chaotic scenes of protest from his supporters that marred attempts at unity on day one , the room largely came together for the historic night , with few boos at all .\nThe healing was helped by fresh opportunities for the Sanders campaign to celebrate its success and vow to continue its fight for more radical social reform . \u201c Because this is a movement fuelled by love it can never be stopped or defeated , \u201d said Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard as she formally proposed Sanders for the nomination .\nShortly before calling for a suspension of the rules to move directly to the nomination of his former rival , Sanders appeared emotional as he listened to his tearful brother Larry announce delegates from the Democrats Abroad primary .\nThe pageant of democracy hid some controversy too .
