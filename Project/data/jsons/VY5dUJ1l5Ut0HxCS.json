Senator Elizabeth Warren , formerly promoted by her employers as a woman of color , has \u2019 fessed up to being as white as Rachel Dolezal waltzing with the ghost of George Plimpton as snow falls gently on Vienna , has endorsed the payment of reparations to African Americans , a position held by Senator Kamala Harris but forsworn by other Democrats , Barack Obama notable among them , and rejected by Senator Bernie Sanders , the Brooklyn socialist who represents Vermont in the Senate and who is seeking the Democratic nomination even though he does not belong to the party .\nThis is , needless to say , another case of symbolism-over-substance Democratic politics .
