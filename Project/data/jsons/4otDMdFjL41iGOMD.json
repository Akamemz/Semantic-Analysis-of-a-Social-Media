Obama on NSA: A reluctant reformer\n\nWe\u2019re not really sorry, but we\u2019ll change.\n\nThat was the message President Barack Obama delivered on behalf of the U.S. government Friday as he announced results of a six-month-long policy review triggered by leaker Edward Snowden\u2019s disclosures about top-secret National Security Agency programs sweeping up vast amounts of U.S. calling data and tapping into the e-mails of foreign citizens who use American internet firms.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nObama argued insistently that the outrage many Americans and foreigners have expressed over U.S. surveillance practices is largely misplaced, but went on to declare that the U.S. will take a series of major \u2014 even unprecedented \u2014 steps to overhaul the way it gathers information on telephone calls and internet communications at home and abroad.\n\n( TRANSCRIPT: President Obama's remarks on NSA program)\n\n\u201cWe cannot unilaterally disarm our intelligence agencies,\u201d the president declared, as he unveiled what an aide described as \u201cvery significant reforms\u201d to the practices he defended.\n\nHere are POLITICO\u2019s takeways from Obama\u2019s long-awaited speech:\n\nProposing a big change, but not how to get there\n\nThe most attention-grabbing announcement in Obama\u2019s address was his call to end the NSA\u2019s collection of information on vast numbers of phone calls made to, from or within the U.S.\n\nBut his description of what the U.S. should do instead actually left the future shape of the government\u2019s phone-call-tracking efforts even murkier than it was before. Obama mentioned two widely-discussed possibilities \u2014 having individual phone companies keep the call data or forming a consortium that would pool the data. But he also added a new option: using other intelligence agency abilities to try to run down leads now traced through the so-called 215 program.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Aide: Obama made key NSA decision Thursday night)\n\nAdding to the muddle: Obama expressed such significant misgivings about the key alternatives that it seemed doubtful he\u2019ll adopt them.\n\n\u201cRelying solely on the records of multiple providers, for example, could require companies to alter their procedures in ways that raise new privacy concerns,\u201d Obama said. \u201cOn the other hand, any third party maintaining a single, consolidated database would be carrying out what is essentially a government function but with more expense, more legal ambiguity, potentially less accountability \u2014 all of which would have a doubtful impact on increasing public confidence that their privacy is being protected.\u201d\n\nSome intelligence experts said reconstructing the current system in the private sector will be somewhere between difficult and impossible.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to figure out a way to keep it as well as its kept at NSA in all dimensions: privacy, accuracy, aglity, breadth and depth,\u201d said former NSA director Michael Hayden.\n\n( WATCH: Obama's NSA speech in 2 minutes)\n\nHayden also questioned the stopgap reform the president said he\u2019d institute: vowing to go to a court before searching the data.\n\n\u201cI am really taken aback by requirement to go the court before you query the data,\u201d he said. \u201cThat just feels like 9/10 to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president was stronger on principle than prescription,\u201d said Sen.

Now it\u2019s a matter of determining implementation on the part of the Attorney General and the intelligence community.\u201d\n\n( PHOTOS: 15 great quotes on NSA spying)\n\nA forceful defense of surveillance, then a call to rein it in\n\nObama spent much of the speech mounting an aggressive defense of the NSA and of the righteousness of the use of surveillance.\n\n\u201cIn an extraordinarily difficult job \u2014 one in which actions are second-guessed, success is unreported, and failure can be catastrophic \u2014 the men and women of the intelligence community, including the NSA, consistently follow protocols designed to protect the privacy of ordinary people,\u201d he declared. \u201cWhat sustains those who work at NSA and our other intelligence agencies through all these pressures is the knowledge that their professionalism and dedication play a central role in the defense of our nation.\u201d\n\nObama even opened his speech with a historic reference to intelligence gathering by America\u2019s revolutionaries two centuries ago, essentially imbuing the NSA with the spirit of the founding fathers.",
