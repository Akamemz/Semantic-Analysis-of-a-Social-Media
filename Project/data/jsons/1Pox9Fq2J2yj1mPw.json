The decision potentially limits the rights of tens of millions of employees .\nThe justices , voting 5-4 along ideological lines , said for the first time Monday that a 1925 federal law lets employers enforce arbitration agreements signed by workers , even if they bar group claims . The majority rejected contentions that a separate law guarantees workers the right to join forces in pressing claims .\nThe ruling builds on previous Supreme Court decisions that let companies channel disputes with consumers and other businesses into arbitration . The latest decision applies directly to wage-and-hour claims , and its reasoning might let employers avoid class action job-discrimination suits as well .\n`` The policy may be debatable but the law is clear : Congress has instructed that arbitration agreements like those before us must be enforced as written , '' Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the majority .\nArbitration supporters say that forum is cheaper and more efficient than traditional litigation . Critics say companies are trying to strip individuals of important rights , including the ability to band together on claims that as a practical matter are too small to press individually .\nJustices Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Stephen Breyer , Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan dissented .
