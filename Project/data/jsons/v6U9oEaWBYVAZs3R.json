''\n`` His departure to God does not end his path or his mission , '' the statement said , published by Fars News Agency . `` But a forceful revenge awaits the criminals who have his blood and the blood of the other martyrs last night on their hands . ''\nSoleimani was killed at Baghdad airport early Friday alongside members of Iran-backed militias operating in Iraq . The airstrike was ordered by President Donald Trump .

His death marks a new , major escalation between Tehran and Washington following Trump 's withdrawal from a nuclear accord between Iran and world powers . Soleimani had a hand in virtually every significant Iranian military and intelligence operation stretching back two decades , including a recent two-day siege against the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad that ended Wednesday .
