How Gorsuch might rule on the legal questions posed by Trump's move is a mystery. Conservative judges tend to be deferential to the executive branch on national security-related issues, but Gorsuch's strong concerns about religious liberty might lead him to be skeptical about rules that are arguably designed to impact a particular religion.\n\n\"That kind of religious discrimination could well cause Gorsuch to take a second look,\" Winkler said.\n\nLabor unions\n\nPerhaps the most certain result of putting Gorsuch on the court is an eventual setback for public employee unions.
