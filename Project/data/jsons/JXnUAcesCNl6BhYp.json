    "content": "Faculty feel less threatened by the opinions of undergraduates than by those of Ph.D. students and their peers .\nMany right-of-center students ( especially those who are grade-obsessed ) self-censor , fearing that their professors will punish them for their political and cultural views if they were to express them in class discussions or assignments .\nIt \u2019 s easy to understand why they are concerned . The dearth of ideological diversity in the professoriate is significant ; in social-research fields , the left-to-right ratio is roughly 10:1 . Professors rarely assign readings by conservative or libertarian intellectuals , let alone engage with such thinkers in a charitable way . Faculty regularly make off-topic jabs at Trump or the Republicans , or even end up digressing into full-on rants . Professors who are moderate and charitable in the classroom may post highly political content on social media ( or occasionally write highly political opinion pieces or blog posts ) expressing antipathy toward Republicans and conservatives . And all of this is amplified , and often distorted , by an outrage-driven media industry .\nIn a new study , three scholars examined the backgrounds , affiliations , and institutional perceptions of more than 7,200 undergraduate students at colleges nationwide and found that liberal students do tend to have closer relationships with faculty than do conservative students . Moreover , there was a gap between the grades of liberal students and conservative students , and the difference persisted even after controlling for things such as race , gender , socioeconomic status , and SAT scores , but the gap was very small : less than one-tenth of a point on a 4-point scale ( e.g. , less than the difference between a 3.0 and 3.1 GPA ) . That is , professors may be slightly biased in grading , but not so much that it is likely to change someone \u2019 s final letter grade for a course .\nThis finding may surprise some , because there is compelling evidence that professors and administrators do engage in ideological discrimination with respect to peer review , institutional review boards , admissions to Ph.D. programs , and faculty hiring and promotion .
