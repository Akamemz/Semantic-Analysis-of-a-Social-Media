    "content": "The Trump administration , taking aim at one of former President Barack Obama \u2019 s signature environmental achievements , is proposing to freeze vehicle fuel economy requirements at the 2020 level and unwind California \u2019 s authority to limit tailpipe emissions in the state .\nThe Environmental Protection Agency and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration jointly proposed on Thursday to cap fuel economy requirements at a fleet average of 37 miles per gallon starting in 2020 . Under the Obama plan , the fleetwide fuel economy would have risen gradually to roughly 47 mpg by 2025 .\nThey also propose to revoke California \u2019 s authority under the Clean Air Act that has allowed the state to set rules more stringent than the federal ones limiting tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions as well as an electric-vehicle sales mandate .\nTaken together , the proposal is an aggressive move to dismantle what some environmentalists have hailed as one of the most potent efforts anywhere in the world to combat climate change . Yet for President Donald Trump , who \u2019 s prioritized eliminating regulations , the auto rules represent a grand prize .\nRelease of the proposal begins a 60-day period of public comment that is sure to attract a spirited response from California \u2019 s leaders who have vowed to defend their smog-fighting authority in court and from environmentalists who view the plan as a setback to efforts to curb climate change . Automakers , who had asked to be relieved of some of the mandates , have expressed misgivings about having to accommodate a patchwork of federal and state standards .\n\u201c There are compelling reasons for a new rulemaking on fuel economy standards for 2021-2026 , \u201d Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said in a statement . \u201c More realistic standards will promote a healthy economy by bringing newer , safer , cleaner and more fuel-efficient vehicles to U.S. roads and we look forward to receiving input from the public . \u201d\nTrump in March 2017 announced his administration would be reopening a review of the Obama automobile rules that he and some automakers said was unfairly cut short by Obama \u2019 s EPA . Before a crowd of autoworkers assembled at a decommissioned car factory , Trump said \u201c we \u2019 re going to work on the CAFE standards so you can make cars in America again . We \u2019 re going to help the companies , and they \u2019 re going to help you . \u201d\nThursday \u2019 s rule-making proposal from the EPA and NHTSA also presents several other options for modifying the Obama targets , while recommending the proposed freeze starting in 2020 , the most severe of the scenarios .\nIn a separate move to unwind California \u2019 s power to set the pace of auto emissions requirements , the proposal also asserts that a 1975 law prohibits states from setting their own greenhouse gas limits , a view two federal district judges have already rejected .\nA 60-day comment period will begin once the proposal is published in the Federal Register , and a final rule could be finalized by the end of 2018 or early next year .\nIn Thursday \u2019 s proposal , the Trump administration argues that its proposed freeze will have a \u201c negligible \u2019 \u2019 impact on air quality , and boost the earth \u2019 s temperature by 3/1000th of one degree Celcius by 2100 .
