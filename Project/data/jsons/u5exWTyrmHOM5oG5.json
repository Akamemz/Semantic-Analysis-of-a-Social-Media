It really reduces the impacts of climate change in very important ways , '' said Prof Jim Skea , who co-chairs the IPCC .\n`` The second is the unprecedented nature of the changes that are required if we are to limit warming to 1.5C - changes to energy systems , changes to the way we manage land , changes to the way we move around with transportation . ''\n`` Scientists might want to write in capital letters , 'ACT NOW , IDIOTS , ' but they need to say that with facts and numbers , '' said Kaisa Kosonen , of Greenpeace , who was an observer at the negotiations . `` And they have . ''\nThe researchers have used these facts and numbers to paint a picture of the world with a dangerous fever , caused by humans . We used to think if we could keep warming below two degrees this century , then the changes we would experience would be manageable .\nNot any more . This new study says that going past 1.5C is dicing with the planet 's liveability . And the 1.5C temperature `` guard rail '' could be exceeded in just 12 years , in 2030 .\nWe can stay below it - but it will require urgent , large-scale changes from governments and individuals and we will have to invest a massive pile of cash every year , about 2.5 % of global gross domestic product ( GDP ) , the value of all goods and services produced , for two decades .\nEven then , we will still need machines , trees and plants to capture carbon from the air that we can then store deep underground - forever .\nThe report says there must be rapid and significant changes in four big global systems :\nBut it adds that the world can not meet its target without changes by individuals , urging people to :\nbuy less meat , milk , cheese and butter and more locally sourced seasonal food - and throw less of it away \u2022 drive electric cars but walk or cycle short distances \u2022 take trains and buses instead of planes \u2022 use videoconferencing instead of business travel \u2022 use a washing line instead of a tumble dryer \u2022 insulate homes \u2022 demand low carbon in every consumer product\nLifestyle changes can make a big difference , said Dr Debra Roberts , the IPCC 's other co-chair .\n`` That 's a very empowering message for the individual , '' she said . `` This is not about remote science ; it is about where we live and work , and it gives us a cue on how we might be able to contribute to that massive change , because everyone is going to have to be involved . ''\n`` You might say you do n't have control over land use , but you do have control over what you eat and that determines land use .\n`` We can choose the way we move in cities and if we do n't have access to public transport - make sure you are electing politicians who provide options around public transport . ''\nGlobal emissions of CO2 need to decline by 45 % from 2010 levels by 2030 Renewables are estimated to provide up to 85 % of global electricity by 2050 Coal is expected to reduce to close to zero Up to seven million sq km of land will be needed for energy crops ( a bit less than the size of Australia ) Global net zero emissions by 2050\nIt wo n't come cheap . The report says to limit warming to 1.5C , will involve `` annual average investment needs in the energy system of around $ 2.4 trillion '' between 2016 and 2035 .\nExperts believe this number needs to be put in context .\n`` There are costs and benefits you have to weigh up , '' said Dr Stephen Cornelius , a former UK IPCC negotiator now with WWF . He says making big emissions cuts in the short term will cost money but be cheaper than paying for carbon dioxide removal later this century .\n`` The report also talks about the benefits as there is higher economic growth at 1.5 degrees than there is at 2C and you do n't have the higher risk of catastrophic impacts at 1.5 that you do at two .
