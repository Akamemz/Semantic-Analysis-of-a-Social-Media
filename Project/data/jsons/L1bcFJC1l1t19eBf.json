How the VA deal came together\nTop negotiators on a deal to reform the Department of Veterans Affairs turned to an unusual strategy that helped them arrive at Monday \u2019 s agreement : knock-down , drag-out arguing .\nJust last week , talks appeared on the verge of collapse as the leaders of a conference committee \u2014 Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt. ) and Rep. Jeff Miller ( R-Fla. ) \u2014 publicly slugged it out over differences on how to pay for the bill . Miller said Sanders was hurling \u201c grenades \u201d at Republicans rather than negotiating while Sanders called the GOP \u2019 s behavior \u201c sad . \u201d\nThose barbs turned out to be more cathartic than detrimental . Two days later , Sanders was informing staffers and lawmakers that a deal was at hand after a final call with Miller during which the two ran down a checklist of priorities and agreed on each detail .\nA similar dynamic played out in June while Sanders was negotiating with Sen. John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) to get to a VA deal that could move through the chamber . Sanders and McCain found themselves yelling at each other in private over the particulars of the legislation . Less than an hour later , they announced a bipartisan deal that passed the Senate in an eye-popping 93-3 vote .\nTaken together , the two events demonstrate how public and private squabbling can actually help relieve gridlock by raising pressure to meet a deadline , particularly on politically perilous issues like health care for veterans .\nAt a time when Congress is seemingly unable to agree on even the most basic policies , the VA breakthrough surprised even the most cynical on Capitol Hill and gave hope that Congress can compromise on big issues if the consequences are steep enough and time is running out .\n\u201c This has been a very difficult process . Chairman Miller and I are working in the context of philosophically the House and the Senate being very different institutions , looking at the world very differently , \u201d Sanders said . \u201c It has been a very , very difficult process . \u201d\nOn Monday , Sanders and Miller announced a deal on legislation that would expand health care access to veterans and make it easier to sack underperforming senior officials . The legislation would cost $ 17 billion \u2014 a staggering sum but far less than previous iterations . Congressional leaders are hoping to grease the procedural wheels of passage as soon as this week .\nThe legislation is a response to revelations earlier in the summer that poor and delayed health care contributed to the deaths of some veterans . The uproar ultimately resulted in then-VA Secretary Eric Shinseki \u2019 s resignation .\nThe swift progress to a deal is noteworthy since negotiations appeared to be at a stalemate last week . Miller unilaterally called a Thursday meeting of the bicameral negotiating group , angering Sanders and Senate Democrats who refused to attend . Instead , they lobbed bombs at Miller and GOP leaders through the media , accusing Republicans of walking away from a deal that would benefit the potent veterans constituency .\nUltimately that conference meeting proved to be pivotal , a GOP leadership source said . It gave Miller the ability to reclaim part of the narrative and woke up Senate Democrats who didn \u2019 t fully grasp how problematic a last-minute funding request from the VA was .\nAnd the public outrage over those setbacks jolted lawmakers and their staffs by offering a preview of what constituents back home might say at August town halls if they failed to act on the VA .\n( Earlier on \u2588\u2588\u2588 : Reforming the VA step by step )\nBefore the committee meeting , McCain said that negotiations had \u201c genuinely \u201d stalled . He was livid and threatened to publicly criticize the panel \u2019 s leaders if the deal fell through . Veterans advocacy groups also began quietly voicing their displeasure to committee members .\n\u201c I mentioned I would be critical of everybody if they didn \u2019 t [ get it done ] , \u201d McCain said . \u201c They acknowledged that if we went out without any resolutions , this would be an all-time low . \u201d\nFailure to reach a deal on VA reform would have meant \u201c a huge dagger in the backs of veterans who so desperately need to have the confidence that the VA system is going to be straightened out , \u201d said Sen. Bill Nelson ( D-Fla. ) .\nUsually , congressional infighting is an obvious indicator that negotiations are going pretty poorly .
