He has quit for good his solo efforts to craft a grand bargain on taxes and spending. And he hasn\u2019t bothered to initiate a substantive conversation with President Barack Obama in this calendar year.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAll of this recently prompted Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, herself a former speaker, to declare on MSNBC that if Boehner were a woman, he would be known as the weakest speaker in U.S. history.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Why the GOP thinks it could blow it)\n\nSo is Boehner weak?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re missing my style, all right?\u201d Boehner told us in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t need to be out there beating the drum every day.
