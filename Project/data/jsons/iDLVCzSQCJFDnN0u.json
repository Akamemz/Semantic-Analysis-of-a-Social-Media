    "content": "On the evening of Oct. 7 , after the `` grab-them-by-the-pussy '' tape had been reverberating for a few hours , I tweeted that `` The next polls from Utah should be interesting . '' And holy mother of God are they .\nA Y2 Analytics poll of 500 likely Utah voters from Oct. 10-11 was published this morning , and the results are the craziest numbers I 've seen in an already unfathomable election year : Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are tied at 26 percent , independent conservative Evan McMullin is closing fast at 22 percent , Gary Johnson is at 14 , and Jill Stein 's at 1 . This in a state where Mitt Romney received 73 percent of the vote in 2012 , and which Republicans have won since 1976 by an average of 36 percentage points .\nThis is Y2 Analytics ' first Utah poll this year , so we do n't have a clean before-and-after comparison yet . As I mentioned in the bottom of this Saturday post about the Mormon-led Republican defection from Trump , two of only three previous Utah polls that included McMullin looked like this :\nDT 34 % HC 25 % GJ 13 % EM 12 % JS 1 % OT 8 % UN 8 % ( Sept. 12-19 Tribune-Hinckley )\nDT 39 % HC 24 % GJ 13 % EM 12 % JS 0 % DC 2 % OT 6 % UN 7 % ( Sept. 1-9 Tribune-Hinckley )\nSo as I pointed out in August , Trump was already in an unprecedentedly weak position in the Beehive State before this latest evidence of his moral vulgarity surfaced . Now Mormons ( who make up an estimated 55 percent of Utah 's population ) look poised to run screaming from the Republican Party 's standard-bearer . The Y2 survey found that a whopping 94 percent of respondents were aware of Trump 's sex-bragging tape , and that McMullin\u2014a Utah native , Brigham Young University grad , and Mormon\u2014was competitive despite only 52 percent being aware enough of him to form an opinion . In addition , according to the Deseret News write-up , `` McMullin soundly beats Trump among those in the poll who identified themselves members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints . ''\nThe campaigns of both McMullin and Johnson are based in Utah , so this poll will intensify what was already a top regional priority for both . The Johnson/Bill Weld shop started its latest fundraising pitch yesterday like so : `` A realistic analysis of polling data across the country shows that Governors Johnson and Weld can win 5 or more states by focusing resources in these key purple states . ''\nJohnson is on the ballot in all 50 states plus Washington , D.C. ; McMullin is on just 11 ( compared to Darrell Castle 's 24 and Rocky De La Feunte 's 20 ) . In most of those states , McMullin is n't making much of a measurable dent\u2014in Virginia this week , for example , he recently registered at 1 percent compared to Johnson 's 7 . But it 's also true that his name does n't always appear on polls , and that many of his states are underpolled to begin with . I would expect him to pull some votes in Idaho ( a safely Republican state with the second-largest concentration of Mormons ) , plus Colorado and New Mexico , each of which feature 2 percent Mormon populations and are easily reachable from the Salt Lake media market .\nGary Johnson , meanwhile , looks to be most competitive in his home base of New Mexico , where a recent poll had him at 24 percent ; plus third-party-friendly Alaska , where a recent pre-Trump-tape poll had him at 18 percent . He was also beating the spread between Clinton and Trump in 18 states , last time I ran the numbers .\nIf either Johnson or McMullin win a state outright , it would mark the first such success by a third-party presidential candidate since George Wallace won five in 1968 . With Clinton 's lead widening over Trump of late , the drama of such a milestone would lessen . But it would be a huge deal either for a Libertarian Party attempting to cement its status as the third alternative in American politics , or for # NeverTrump conservatives looking to build from the wreckage of a self-damaging election . There is no doubt that the LP will win the overall bronze in the popular vote , but will the conservative alternative sneak past in the Electoral College ? The answer to that question will give us some interesting clues about what post-Trump politics will look like in America .",
