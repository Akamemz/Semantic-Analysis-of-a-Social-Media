    "content": "Politics , we \u2019 re sometimes told is a war of ideas . Unfortunately , those ideas , at least on one side of the aisle , seem to be that Brett Kavanaugh is a rapist and Donald Trump is a spy for the Kremlin . Instead of reading Plato \u2019 s Republic or Aristotle \u2019 s Politics , the aspiring Democratic Capitol Hill staffer might be better advised to study the movies I Was a Teenage Werewolf ( 1957 , with Michael Landon cast as Brett Kavanaugh ) and I Married a Communist ( 1949 , with Robert Ryan playing the Donald Trump role and Laraine Day as the unsuspecting Melania ) .\nDon \u2019 t get me wrong , ideas in politics can be wonderful things , but they can also be irrelevant . If you tell a political pro your age , sex , race , marital status , religious affiliation , education , and hometown , he can probably predict your vote with ninety percent certainty . Your political beliefs are settled long before you cast a ballot and are moved only marginally by policy discussions .\nThat \u2019 s why elections are about turnout , and it \u2019 s why Democrats inevitably try to inflame their base by accusing every Republican of racism , sexism , and even Putinism .\nThey also think farther down the road than most Republicans do . Their immigration , education , and social policies are designed to make the electorate more liberal . Liberals believe the future belongs to them , because the people who vote overwhelmingly Republican ( whites , conservatives , Christians ) are losing demographic ground to people who vote overwhelmingly Democrat ( ethnic minorities , liberals , atheists ) .
