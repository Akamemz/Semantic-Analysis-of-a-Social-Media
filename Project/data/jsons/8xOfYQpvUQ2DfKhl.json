Mitt Romney was reported to have been so certain of a victory on Tuesday night that he cast aside tradition and did not draft a concession speech . But conservatives now say his misplaced confidence \u2014 and theirs \u2014 were bolstered by the predictions of many like-minded pundits , which were broadcast and posted online around the clock by sympathetic news outlets .\n`` You had this kind of mutually reinforcing phenomenon going on between the Romney campaign [ and ] some influential commentators \u2014 and then a lot of that commentary gets repeated in the media at large , '' said Byron York , chief political correspondent for the conservative Washington Examiner .\nYork said that stunned Republicans at Romney 's Boston headquarters told him they were influenced by the results of surveys conducted by the campaign 's pollster , Neil Newhouse , and by what they heard on the air and saw in print .\nSimilarly , conservative columnist John Podhoretz of the New York Post had argued before the election that many pollsters were ignoring the high turnout by Republicans in the 2010 elections that swept the GOP into control of the U.S. House . The 2012 race would be the same , proving Obama 's 2008 win to be an anomaly , Podhoretz argued \u2014 quite mistakenly , as he conceded afterward .\n`` Because I had a rooting interest in the other side , that view was strengthened and amplified by what I wanted to happen , which I freely confess , '' said Podhoretz , also the editor of the conservative Commentary magazine and a cultural critic for the conservative Weekly Standard . `` People do n't ordinarily cast a skeptical eye on data and information that supports their opinions .

Former chief George W.

And indeed , Podhoretz and other conservatives contended that liberals and their sympathizers in the press corps clicked on Nate Silver 's 538 blog in the New York Times hour after hour not because of their fascination with the mathematical probabilities but out of a desperate need for reassurance that President Obama would win re-election .\nBut in the days after Obama cruised to victory , former George W.
