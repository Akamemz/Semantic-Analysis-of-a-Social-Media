(Ryan Remiorz/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\nTORONTO (AP) \u2014 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won a second term in Canada\u2019s national elections Monday, losing the majority but delivering unexpectedly strong results despite having been weakened by a series of scandals that tarnished his image as a liberal icon.\n\nTrudeau\u2019s Liberal party took the most seats in Parliament, giving it the best chance to form a government. However, falling short of a majority meant the Liberals would have to rely on an opposition party to pass legislation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not quite the same as 2015.

While Trudeau certainly deserves credit for what has happened he\u2019s really going to have to demonstrate qualities that he hasn\u2019t yet shown.\u201d\n\nStill, the results were a victory for Trudeau, whose clean-cut image took a hit after old photos of him in blackface and brownface surfaced last month.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised at how well Trudeau has done,\u201d said Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody expected Trudeau to get a majority but they are not that far off.\u201d\n\nWith results still trickling in early Tuesday, the Liberals had 156 seats \u2014 14 short of the 170 needed for a majority in the 338-seat House of Commons.\n\n\u201cTonight Canadians rejected division and negativity. They rejected cuts and austerity. They elected a progressive agenda and strong action on climate change,\u201d Trudeau said early Tuesday.\n\nHis address to supporters came, unusually, as his Conservative rival, Andrew Scheer, had just begun speaking to his own supporters, forcing networks to tear away from Scheer\u2019s speech. But the prime minister struck a conciliatory note: \u201cTo those who did not vote for us, know that we will work every single day for you, we will govern for everyone,\u201d Trudeau said.\n\nThe Canadian vote came down to what was essentially a choice between the handsome and charismatic Trudeau and Scheer, the Conservatives\u2019 unassuming leader who was seen as the perfect antidote to Trudeau\u2019s flash and celebrity.\n\nTrudeau reasserted liberalism in 2015 after almost 10 years of Conservative Party government in Canada, but scandals combined with high expectations damaged his prospects.\n\nPerhaps sensing Trudeau was in trouble, Barack Obama made an unprecedented endorsement by a former American president in urging Canadians to re-elect Trudeau and saying the world needs his progressive leadership now.\n\nTrudeau, son of the liberal icon and late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, is one of the few remaining progressive world leaders in the Trump era and even appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine under the headline \u201cWhy Can\u2019t He Be Our President?\u201d\n\nScheer, 40, is a career politician who was seen as a possible antidote to Trudeau\u2019s flash.
