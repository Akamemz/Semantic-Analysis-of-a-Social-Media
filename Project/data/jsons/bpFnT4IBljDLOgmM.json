    "content": "The way the wind whipped on the other end of the line , the State Department \u2019 s special representative for Iran knew the man he \u2019 d called was at sea .\n\u201c This is Brian Hook , \u201d the American official said , his voice stern and direct . The connection wasn \u2019 t great , and the swirling gusts made it hard for the Mediterranean shipping executive on the other end to hear him clearly .\n\u201c This is Brian Hook from the State Department , \u201d the Iran envoy repeated , hoping his words would cut through the noise . With a hint of resignation in his voice , the shipping executive responded after a long pause , \u201c I know who you are . \u201d\nThen came the thrust of the conversation : Ensure your ships don \u2019 t carry Iranian crude , said Hook , or that would defy the Trump administration \u2019 s maximum pressure campaign against the Islamic Republic .\nBut to understand just why a high-ranking State Department official would jump on the phone with a shipping magnate , it helps to know a bit more about oil . In particular , Iranian oil .\nAccording to the latest estimates , Iran boasts the third- or fourth-largest oil reserves in the world . Even with obsolete extraction and refining technology , it \u2019 s bursting with black gold . A find announced just this November added an estimated 53 billion barrels to what are called \u201c recoverable \u201d reserves \u2014 this one just 180 feet underground . Compared to , say , the complexity and challenge of pulling crude from deepwater drilling rigs in the North Sea or hydraulic fracking in North Dakota , this is basically like scooping oil from a sandbox .\nIt \u2019 s not surprising , then , that Iran \u2019 s economy relies heavily upon crude exports . The problem is that exporting oil has been increasingly hard of late \u2014 and Iran \u2019 s economy is in a parlous way .\nThe US government \u2014 under Hook \u2019 s direction \u2014 has imposed a heavy toll of sanctions on Tehran , limiting the state \u2019 s ability to conduct financial transactions , import goods , and sell its voluminous reserves of oil on the global market . But the Iranian government hasn \u2019 t taken this lying down .\nSometimes tankers \u201c go dark \u201d as they near Iranian ports , with captains disregarding international rules that require they divulge the ship \u2019 s position and course . Sometimes Iran employs ship-to-ship transfers \u2014 transferring cargo to another seagoing vessel \u2014 to make the goods harder to track . And other times the Islamic Republic , or others doing business with it , will forge paperwork to hide what \u2019 s being exported .\nBut when Hook gets a tip , he likes to know other important players have the same information . And recently , the envoy has been busy , reaching out directly to a handful of high-powered maritime leaders and at least a dozen ship captains to convince them \u2014 through a mixture of threats and financial incentives \u2014 not to do business with Iran . \u201c We are trying to dry up their labor pool to move illicit oil , \u201d a US official told the Financial Times of the outreach .\nThe shipping world , then , knows about the bookish lawyer-turned-diplomat . But you \u2019 d be forgiven if you \u2019 ve never heard of him . Until recently , most people hadn \u2019 t .\nOne of the most important foreign policy officials in the Trump administration , the 51-year-old Iowa native has helped design the administration \u2019 s new strategy toward Asia and North Korea . He has a hand in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process . And he \u2019 s close to Trump \u2019 s inner circle , especially senior White House adviser and presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner .\nAnd for over a year now , he \u2019 s been serving as the US special representative for Iran , spearheading the president \u2019 s campaign against the country \u2014 placing crushing sanctions on the Islamic Republic \u2019 s economy to compel it to negotiate a new nuclear deal with America and thoroughly change its behavior .\n\ufeffTrump and Pompeo may be the faces of US foreign policy , then , but Hook is the one working behind the scenes to turn the president \u2019 s scattershot impulses into a meaningful strategy toward the country .\n\u201c He \u2019 s the translator , \u201d said R.C . Hammond , a former top Trump State Department official and Hook friend .\nOnce a Trump critic , Hook served as a senior official in the George W. Bush administration , a top adviser to Mitt Romney \u2019 s presidential campaign , and a confidante of former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson . That he worked his way from the heart of the Republican establishment to lead a nontraditional Republican \u2019 s signature foreign policy remains stunning to many .\n\u201c He \u2019 s a survivor , \u201d said a State Department official who , like others interviewed for this story , requested anonymity to speak freely about a colleague .\nHis survival , though , is now under threat . Current and former State employees \u2014 many of whom worked with or for Hook \u2014 complain the top diplomat ignores them or shuts them out completely . A State Department report detailed how Hook pushed out a staffer over outside conservative pressure for bigoted and partisan reasons , a conclusion he fiercely denies .\nIt all adds fodder for his many critics in Congress who say his grasp of Iran policy is rudimentary and overly aggressive . \u201c I \u2019 m not a fan of his , \u201d Sen. Tim Kaine ( D-VA ) , a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees , told me . \u201c He is like a John Bolton type : bellicose first , analyze later , if at all , then justify the bellicose actions we take as necessary . I don \u2019 t think his assessment of the Iran situation shows much real-world connection . \u201d\nEven certain congressional Republicans agree , telling me Hook \u2019 s personnel problems make it impossible for him to testify in front of Congress again . \u201c He \u2019 ll get eaten alive , \u201d said a senior aide to a Republican senator , noting many top GOP lawmakers and Trump allies still support the envoy .\nIf things in Washington aren \u2019 t all warm and fuzzy for Hook , it \u2019 s not all roses out in the world , either . Hook organized a disastrous international conference that isolated America more than Iran , critics say . Europeans didn \u2019 t accede to his demands to reform the nuclear deal as the administration initially wanted . Despite the strain on the regime , Tehran lashed out violently to America \u2019 s withdrawal of the Iran deal by bombing oil fields in Saudi Arabia and restarting its nuclear program . In recent weeks , the government has cracked down on protesters demanding new leadership , killing at least 180 people and perhaps hundreds more .\nTehran \u2019 s actions , some fear , could set it on a collision course with Washington that could turn into a disastrous war .\nThrough it all , Hook has stayed out of the limelight , instead finding a place steps from the secretary of state \u2019 s office and in the heart of the Trump administration . \u201c We \u2019 re putting Iran at the center of everything , \u201d a State Department official told me , \u201c which puts Hook at the center of everything. \u201d That makes understanding Hook vital to understanding Trump \u2019 s foreign policy today \u2014 and what it could mean for Iran heading into a critical year .\nThis account of Hook \u2019 s career , including his three years at the top of President Trump \u2019 s foreign policy team , is based on interviews with nearly 20 current and former US officials , congressional members and staff , experts , and people close to him .\nThe son of a banker , Hook grew up a staunch Catholic with an eye for politics . As a teenager , he watched The McLaughlin Group every Sunday and was dazzled by conservative icon William F. Buckley Jr. Once in college , he called Buckley \u2019 s agent to express admiration and received an invite to watch the firebrand speak in Bemidji , Minnesota , after which Hook got to eat dinner with the commentator .\nThey became quick friends , going on sailing trips and holding deep conversations about their Catholic faith , the music of Bach , and books \u2014 anything besides politics . Buckley left those conversations for his op-eds and television appearances . Hook admired that Buckley \u2019 s life was larger than politics , and it \u2019 s a code the husband and father of three tries to live by in his personal life , those close to him say .\nBut Hook still pined for politics . He got his first chance in the 1990s , when he worked as a legislative aide to both Iowa Rep. James Leach and Iowa Gov . Terry Branstad ( now the US ambassador to China ) while attending law school . Those who knew him then said he showed an aptitude for public service . After graduating from law school at the University of Iowa in 1999 , Hook moved to Washington \u2014 but to practice corporate law at the private firm of Hogan and Hartson .\nWorking in the nation \u2019 s capital , Hook increasingly immersed in the political world , and in 2003 joined the Department of Justice under President Bush . He quickly climbed the ladder , serving as a special adviser to the president on policy , where Hook learned the high-stakes and quick tempo operations of the White House . At the United Nations as a special adviser to the ambassador , he gained familiarity with the intricacies of diplomacy , sanctions policy , human rights , and Iran .\nHe then became the acting assistant secretary of state for international organizations in June 2008 , receiving an official confirmation by the Senate that October \u2014 four months before Barack Obama was sworn in as president . \u201c The fact that he got confirmed so late in the Bush administration shows the strong bipartisan relationships he has , \u201d Kristen Silverberg , Hook \u2019 s immediate predecessor in that role , told me .\nThose close to Hook attribute that to his outwardly warm , affable demeanor . \u201c He \u2019 s political , but not partisan , \u201d a person close to Hook told me .\nHis thirst for politics didn \u2019 t end when he left government at the end of the Bush administration in 2009 . He got to work as the foreign policy adviser for Minnesota Gov . Tim Pawlenty \u2019 s presidential run . When Pawlenty \u2019 s campaign ended , Hook moved over to become a senior adviser on Mitt Romney \u2019 s team , helping him shape the eventual Republican nominee \u2019 s worldview .\nThat campaign cycle had an unusual focus on foreign policy . Romney repeatedly assailed Obama \u2019 s record with the usual Republican talking points : He was weak on terrorism , Russia , North Korea , and Iran ; he embraced dictators instead of allies ; and he shied away from using US military power abroad \u2014 particularly in the Middle East \u2014 over fears of embroiling the US in another war .\nThose arguments , though , weren \u2019 t quite enough to convince voters to dislodge the incumbent . After Romney lost , Hook , along with his campaign colleagues Eliot Cohen and Eric Edelman , felt they should stick together to keep Romney \u2019 s internationalism alive and groom the next generation of Republican foreign policy leaders .\nThey founded the John Hay Initiative , a think tank and advisory group promoting that internationalist vision , in 2013 . \u201c We \u2019 re trying to build the bench \u201d of new Republican foreign policy leaders , Hook told the Wall Street Journal in 2015 .\nPeter Feaver , a former Bush administration official who worked for Hook at John Hay , described him as \u201c charming \u201d and \u201c serious , \u201d adding that Hook \u201c isn \u2019 t the kind of sharp-elbowed , sharp-tongued player you encounter in Washington. \u201d That served Hook well when handling the political side of the group \u2019 s operations , some said , as he worked contacts in Congress and attracted donors . He managed to do all that while also running his own international consulting firm , Latitude , and engaging in humanitarian projects like improving refugee housing conditions and women \u2019 s health in sub-Saharan Africa .\nThen came candidate Trump and his \u201c America First \u201d foreign policy . It was anathema to much of what the initiative stood for . Cohen , Hook \u2019 s co-lead at John Hay , orchestrated the March 2016 release of a letter signed by 122 GOP foreign policy experts , all agreeing they were \u201c united in our opposition to a Donald Trump presidency. \u201d It was one of multiple statements made by so-called \u201c Never Trumpers \u201d who argued the candidate \u2019 s stances were dangerous for the country .\nHook seemingly felt the same way : \u201c Even if you say you support him as the nominee , \u201d he told Politico in 2016 , \u201c you go down the list of his positions and you see you disagree on every one . \u201d\nBut Hook didn \u2019 t sign Cohen \u2019 s Never Trump letter \u2014 or any other public declaration against candidate Trump . The reason , according to those familiar with his thinking , was a mix of patriotism and worry about his future prospects . \u201c He \u2019 s not a letter signer , \u201d a person close to him told me . \u201c He wants people to serve their country . \u201d\nThat reticence , or patriotism , allowed Hook \u2019 s friend Chris Christie , the former governor of New Jersey and one-time presidential candidate , to pull Hook into the Trump transition team . His name was floated for a top administration job , but it was unclear what exactly it might be .\nHook \u201c isn \u2019 t the kind of sharp-elbowed , sharp-tongued player you encounter in Washington . \u201d\nIt became more apparent the day before Trump \u2019 s inauguration . On January 19 , 2017 , the president \u2019 s pick for secretary of state , then-Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson , held a one-hour meeting with Hook in which they discussed how the administration might run foreign policy . The two men didn \u2019 t know each other , but by the end , Hook was offered the job as director of policy planning in the State Department and Tillerson \u2019 s chief foreign policy adviser .\nHook asked his soon-to-be boss what , exactly , would be expected of him in the role . Tillerson , according to a senior department official , simply replied , \u201c Let \u2019 s figure it out when you get in . \u201d\nHook was integral to \u201c how the building ran \u201d early in Trump \u2019 s presidency\nThe policy planning office ( known internally as S/P ) is akin to the State Department \u2019 s in-house think tank . Filled with career staffers that span multiple administrations , it \u2019 s an office for long-term thinking on nearly every challenge facing the country . Whoever leads this team helps set the course of US foreign policy for years , and previous officeholders include prominent figures like George Kennan , Anne-Marie Slaughter , and Richard Haass .\nHook \u2019 s arrival as director was encouraging for many in the policy office . \u201c There was a lot of optimism on the team when he joined , \u201d a former State Department official who worked with Hook told me . \u201c We thought he \u2019 d be very helpful since he was at State before , knew how the building worked , and would respect career staff in a way the administration hadn \u2019 t . \u201d\nCurrent and former staffers told me that Hook didn \u2019 t hold a staff meeting for at least his first six weeks in the building . Employees reporting directly to him , many working on top issues like Iran and North Korea , didn \u2019 t know what their new boss wanted from them . \u201c There was no direction , no blueprint in terms of how he wanted things to run and what he expected , \u201d one former staffer told me . \u201c Colleagues were fighting for work and spent most of their time in the cafeteria with nothing to do . \u201d\nThat , in large part , was a function of the broader chaos inside the State Department . While most incoming administrations have teams of people lined up to hit the ground running on Inauguration Day , the Trump administration spent months without top diplomats in place . Other than Tillerson and his deputy , John Sullivan , no other Senate-confirmed appointee at the undersecretary or assistant secretary level came into office for many months , meaning Hook had to spend days and weeks away from his team to travel with Tillerson or brief the White House on policy .\nHook prefers to work in tight teams , State Department officials told me , and he frequently held small-group meetings in his office on North Korea , Iran , China , and ISIS . Those who worked on topics not on the president \u2019 s priority list didn \u2019 t get much face time with the boss . Hook likes \u201c go-getters , \u201d said a senior department official , and it was up to someone leading a non-priority portfolio to make the case for why they should pay more attention to their issue .\nStaffers who got to interact often with Hook , though , came away with a good impression . \u201c All those willing to offer ideas , written products , and support the process were given meaningful and substantive roles , \u201d said a current department official in an email . \u201c This was a meritocracy : excellent written products , fresh ideas , and energy were rewarded. \u201d Hook \u201c connected with the secretary and started building a staff process appropriate to his and the interagency \u2019 s needs . \u201d\nFurther , the official offered a theory for why so much ire was reserved for Hook . \u201c Those folks were not inclined toward constructive and receptive team-building with the incoming secretary and key secretary assistants . This created in S/P a sort of professionally neutral group ready to build bridges with incoming leadership and row hard in a new direction , and a defend-existing-policy/resist change group . \u201d\nThat would reflect a general sentiment inside the State Department . There was widespread disillusionment among the ranks \u2014 people were suspicious of Trump and his pick , Tillerson . But even among the Trump believers , the highest-level officials didn \u2019 t have the necessary political support to do their jobs .\nTillerson , for example , was an outsider who hadn \u2019 t met Trump before being tapped to lead the building . He only came to Trump \u2019 s attention after top Bush administration officials , like former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and former National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley \u2014 both of whom had ties to ExxonMobil \u2014 pushed for his appointment .\nBetween the vacancies and general chaos , Hook quickly rose to the top of the administration \u2019 s foreign policy team . \u201c Tillerson , [ State Department Chief of Staff Margaret ] Peterlin , and Hook \u2014 that \u2019 s how the building ran \u201d early on , a State Department official told me .\nHook \u2019 s biggest assignment , a directive from the president and the secretary of state , was to convince America \u2019 s European allies to reform the Iran deal , known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action , or JCPOA .\nThe negotiated 2015 accord \u2014 signed by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council , plus Germany , the EU , and of course , Iran \u2014 lifted sanctions on Tehran in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear program and invasive monitoring of facilities . It was one of Obama \u2019 s signature foreign policy achievements , heralded by Democrats as a historic diplomatic moment and lambasted by Republicans as naive capitulation .\nOn the campaign trail , Trump called it \u201c the stupidest deal of all time , \u201d seemingly because it didn \u2019 t do anything to address Iran \u2019 s ballistic missile program or support for terrorism in the region , and because it included a time limit for when the restrictions on its nuclear program would end . He vowed to get the US out of the deal on his first day as president .\nBut in office , Trump administration officials \u2014 many of whom believed the US should remain in the deal , flawed though it may have been \u2014 set out to try to negotiate a new side agreement that would address those concerns and keep America in the Iran deal . To do so , the US would first need to get the Europeans on board .\nHook spent months criss-crossing the Atlantic trying to negotiate an enhanced agreement , knowing that Trump \u2019 s patience with the endeavor was limited .\n\u201c In the event we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies , then the agreement will be terminated , \u201d Trump said in an October 2017 speech on Iran strategy . \u201c It is under continuous review , and our participation can be canceled by me , as president , at any time . \u201d\nThe Europeans wouldn \u2019 t budge , State Department officials told me , because they wanted to stay true to the already-signed agreement and they had business interests in Iran . Whenever Hook would send documents to his European counterparts with language about removing end dates on the nuclear restrictions , they would come back with bright red lines straight through them , a senior department official told me .\nToughening the deal remained administration policy through at least February 2018 , when Hook spoke at a Duke University event moderated by Feaver , a professor there and his former colleague at the John Hay Initiative . \u201c I know the logic that he was pursuing , and I genuinely believe he was trying to get a deal and to get the Europeans to toughen and sweeten their part to get better leverage on Iran , \u201d Feaver confided . \u201c The approach was clearly \u2018 Let \u2019 s fix the Iran deal from inside . \u2019 \u201d\nIt didn \u2019 t work . During an April 2018 Oval Office meeting , French President Emmanuel Macron tried to convince Trump that Europe was close to agreeing to a Hook-brokered deal in an effort to keep the Obama-era agreement in place \u2014 which some US officials suspected was a ruse to placate Trump .\nTrump , however , didn \u2019 t seem to know his own administration \u2019 s foreign policy was to revamp the Iran deal or even who was leading that effort . Trump \u2019 s first reaction to Macron \u2019 s plea for a bit more time was : \u201c Who \u2019 s Brian Hook ? \u201d He pulled the US out of the Iran deal the following month .\nHook still had his admirers in the White House , though , even if he wasn \u2019 t a household name in the Oval Office . The White House requested his presence often to brief advisers , mainly Stephen Miller and Jared Kushner , on policy , as well as to attend other normal foreign policy meetings .\n\u201c He was at the White House all the time , \u201d a State Department official told me . \u201c The White House would call and tell him to come over , and he would oblige. \u201d Kushner , Miller , and Hook grew close during those many briefings , giving the department leader allies close to the president .\nHook \u2019 s defenders say his deference to the White House is defensible . Few knew if they were valued by a mercurial president , and the actions of many top officials could be explained \u2014 if not forgiven \u2014 mostly by their will to survive in the administration . When the president \u2019 s team calls , you come running , and Hook \u2019 s phone rang often due to the State Department \u2019 s many vacancies . He was \u201c the guy \u201d because he was the only guy around .\nOthers , though , claim Hook enjoyed his proximity to power . \u201c He got excited when he got to go to Mar-a-Lago for a weekend , \u201d another former State Department employee told me . \u201c He was really diving in as much as he could with the new team , and that was his only focus . \u201d\nAs Hook grew closer to the White House , some career officials in his team suffered . When a high-level Western European delegation came to meet with Hook in February 2017 , no one in the State Department knew about the gathering until that country \u2019 s embassy called the relevant desk officer hours before they got to the building . That staffer then contacted the policy planning office to ask if they could send someone to take notes .\n\u201c We kind of scrambled and asked Brian if someone other than him could be in the meeting . He agreed , but the sense was he did it to placate us , \u201d a former department official told me . \u201c I don \u2019 t think he trusted his staff . There was a feeling that he was trying to shut us out . \u201d\nFor some , that sense of alienation became clearer when Hook assigned two Pentagon detailees to run a project on how to redesign policymaking inside the State Department . Hook entrusted the military officers with the task due to their previous management and planning experience , but it still felt odd to long-time State Department employees to ask military officials to remake years of department operations . They \u2019 d already been affronted by the bevy of consulting firms brought in by Tillerson to revamp the building \u2019 s processes .\n\u201c It was a like a civilian going into a war room and telling people how to invade . \u201d\nThe final proposal , per five people familiar with the situation , was that Hook \u2019 s team would lead all policy generation on everything \u2014 not just Iran . Afterward , Hook would bring options to Tillerson and his top lieutenants for their approval . The accepted plans would then \u201c trickle down , \u201d in the words of one person , from leadership \u2014 including the policy planning office \u2014 to the rest of the bureaus for implementation .\nThat idea wasn \u2019 t overly radical , though . Policy planning directors in the past , including during the Obama administration , wielded immense influence over crafting and executing foreign policy . And despite the extensive expertise throughout the State Department offices in Washington and embassies around the world , it \u2019 s not unheard of for the secretary to set policy without much input and have staffers execute it .\nTillerson also wanted a bigger say in how his building created policy proposals in top-level administration discussions , especially since he was surrounded by Cabinet officials , like then-Defense Secretary James Mattis , who had immense experience and early influence on the president . Trump constantly boasted about having \u201c his generals \u201d by his side ; Tillerson , by contrast , was kept at arm \u2019 s length . So Hook , according to multiple officials , wanted to give the boss a proposal to satisfy his strong preference for greater influence in US foreign policy .\nMany on Hook \u2019 s team agreed there was ( and remains ) room to streamline and improve the building \u2019 s processes , but what the military planners devised at Hook \u2019 s request unsettled his employees .\n\u201c What \u2019 s the point of having all these experts in your building if you have all these closed-circuit proposals ? \u201d one former official told me . A current staffer expressed incredulity in more colorful language : \u201c It was like a civilian going into a war room and telling people how to invade . Sure , trim the fat , but that was like killing ants with a sledgehammer. \u201d The proposal , like many of Tillerson \u2019 s reforms , never went into place .\nTillerson continued to entrust his top lieutenants with foreign policymaking , and much of the building felt sidelined by his leadership style . It wasn \u2019 t just bureaucratic hiccups or sour grapes that angered staffers in his charge , which could be understandable for a new boss in a tumultuous administration . Hook early on became embroiled in a scandal that has put a black mark on his time in government and possibly his future career .\nA civil service employee who handled the Iran and Gulf country portfolios for the policy planning team , Sahar Nowrouzzadeh joined the US government in 2005 during the George W. Bush administration . During the Obama years , she helped craft the nuclear deal from inside the White House , an accord that Republicans en masse despised .\n\u201c If there \u2019 s one thing that unifies Republicans , it \u2019 s that the Iran deal was not a good deal for security and non-proliferation , \u201d said Silverberg , Hook \u2019 s predecessor at the State Department \u2019 s international organizations bureau and now a top executive at the Business Roundtable .\nAs Trump came to power , his loyalists looked for any signs that \u201c deep state \u201d operatives were conspiring against the president . The paranoia grew as the administration early on suffered leaks about the president \u2019 s conduct and mishaps throughout the government . The White House was also obsessed with this notion of a bureaucratic attempt to destroy Trump \u2014 a message that fit with his stated desire to \u201c drain the swamp \u201d of entrenched , unelected officials thwarting the movement he led .\nTrump allies began to attack US officials suspected of anti-Trump sentiments . Nowrouzzadeh soon found herself directly in the crosshairs . Not only had she worked on the Iran deal in the Obama administration , but her Iranian heritage raised eyebrows \u2014 even though she was born in the United States . Articles in Breitbart and elsewhere claimed she had cried after Trump won the election and unfailingly cited her previous work for the National Iranian American Council , which some say is close to the country \u2019 s regime . Nowrouzzadeh , her backers note , was just an intern there .\nThe anti-Nowrouzzadeh campaign soon reached a high-powered audience . Newt Gingrich , the former House speaker and current Trump booster , sent to multiple State Department officials \u2014 including Peterlin , Tillerson \u2019 s chief of staff \u2014 a March 14 , 2017 , Conservative Review article claiming she had \u201c burrowed into the government under President Trump . \u201d\nA report by the State Department \u2019 s inspector general , released in November after months of investigating Hook \u2019 s conduct toward Nowrouzzadeh , provides extensive detail on what happened next .\nHook received the Conservative Review article and sent it to a career staffer and his deputy , Ed Lacey . When Hook asked Lacey about Nowrouzzadeh , Lacey said that many people working in the policy planning staff were Obama holdovers .\n\u201c Their picks \u201d \u2014 meaning who was chosen to work in the office during the Obama administration \u2014 \u201c without exception , were Obama/Clinton loyalists not at all supportive of President Trump \u2019 s foreign policy agenda , \u201d Lacey emailed , adding that \u201c all of these detailees have tried to stay on \u201d the team . \u201c Ed \u2013 This is helpful . Let \u2019 s discuss on Monday , \u201d Hook replied .\nThat was a change of tune for Lacey , who only days before Trump \u2019 s inauguration had only great things to say about Nowrouzzadeh .\n\u201c Sahar \u2019 s performance as a Member of the Secretary of State \u2019 s Policy Planning Staff ( S/P ) over the rating period [ from July 2016 to that point ] has been first rate and has exceeded by far the standards expected of a foreign affairs officer of her grade , \u201d Lacey wrote to another State Department staffer in a performance review I obtained that has not been previously reported .\n\u201c She is exceptionally well positioned to continue to excel at her position , and should be looked upon very favorably for a promotion as soon as possible so that she can make full use of her talents going forward , \u201d Lacey concluded .\nIt \u2019 s unclear why Lacey \u2019 s opinion of Nowrouzzadeh changed so sharply with Hook at the helm . What is clear , however , is that Hook \u2014 with Lacey \u2019 s help \u2014 wanted to replace her , despite no concrete evidence she did anything to stymie Hook \u2019 s policies or Trump \u2019 s Iran strategy .\nSeveral State Department officials saw Nowrouzzadeh go into Hook \u2019 s office on March 20 , 2017 , in an effort they say was to seek his help against the broadsides . It \u2019 s unclear what happened during that one-on-one session , but some told me they saw the staffer immediately afterward in her office and noticed she had been crying .\nThen in April , Lacey wrote an email to Hook in which he said another department official \u201c asked me to initiate the process of wrapping up [ Nowrouzzadeh \u2019 s ] detail . ... Unless I hear otherwise from you , I will do so today. \u201d Hook simply responded , \u201c Yes I agree , \u201d and Lacey then let Nowrouzzadeh go . She formally filed her complaint in May , detailing how unfairly she thought her reassignment was handled .\nAccording to several people familiar with the situation and the IG \u2019 s report , Lacey told Nowrouzzadeh she was being removed from her role on the Policy Planning Staff because someone else was coming in to handle Iranian affairs . However , that new person \u2014 who didn \u2019 t know Hook personally \u2014 didn \u2019 t arrive until months later , indicating that a normal staffing change wasn \u2019 t the main reason for her reassignment .\n\u201c Employee One \u2019 s [ Nowrouzzadeh \u2019 s ] detail ... ended on or about April 17 , 2017 , although it was scheduled to end on or about July 4 . Mr. McInnis , the replacement Schedule C appointee to cover S/P \u2019 s Iran work , started in September 2017 , \u201d the IG \u2019 s report reads .\nHook , I was told by two State Department officials , never said a word to Nowrouzzadeh after her dismissal .\nHook got a chance to counter the IG \u2019 s conclusion in the report . \u201c I did not \u2018 acquiesce to pressure \u2019 to use non-merit factors , \u201d he responded . \u201c My personnel decision was lawful , proper , and within the administrative standards for the Department of State. \u201d He added that once he started work as policy planning chief in February , he already \u201c intended to hire my own expert for Iran and the Gulf . \u201d\nHook is still pleading his case . According to a senior administration official , he \u2019 s telling State Department officials that the IG report was biased against him and faulty from the start . He is considering some sort of direct action against the IG office \u2019 s staff , but it \u2019 s unclear what that exactly may be .\nFurther , Hook argues he couldn \u2019 t have been biased against Nowrouzzadeh since the two of them didn \u2019 t interact until that late March meeting , going so far as to say she never sent him a substantive email . But two State Department officials \u2014 one current and one former \u2014 say that they saw \u201c multiple \u201d emails she sent to Hook featuring substantive policy issues on Iran . Many of those emails contained classified information .\nHook \u2019 s defenders also insist he did everything by the book and that he had the absolute right to form the team he wanted . Nowrouzzadeh , as a holdover from the Obama administration , just didn \u2019 t gel , they say . Hook felt he knew the Iran portfolio well enough and that Nowrouzzadeh wasn \u2019 t a \u201c go-getter , \u201d anyway . What \u2019 s more , they note , the IG report doesn \u2019 t cite a single interview or document that directly ties Hook to forcing out Nowrouzzadeh for bigoted or political reasons .\nTom Shannon , who until February 2018 served as Trump \u2019 s undersecretary of state for policy \u2014 the State Department \u2019 s third highest-ranking position \u2014 told me those arguments don \u2019 t hold water . \u201c I saw her in several instances at the White House and State , and she \u2019 s an absolute professional , \u201d he said . \u201c She completely dominates the subject matter that she works on . \u201d\n\u201c It \u2019 s offensive to hear her characterized as somehow a slouch , and I think it reflects very poorly on those who are doing this , \u201d he continued .\nNowrouzzadeh \u2019 s colleagues were alarmed by what they saw \u2014 not only because of what happened , but also because of what they feared might happen to them . \u201c Morale plummeted , \u201d said a current State Department staffer , \u201c and people started jumping ship . \u201d\nHook \u2019 s supporters tell a different story . Some people I spoke to said that spirits in the entire policy planning outfit vastly improved after those initial months . Full staff meetings resumed , communication flowed , and Hook \u2019 s high profile made the team \u2019 s work extremely important and valued . One person even said they were \u201c stoked \u201d to be in that office .\nHammond , the former top State Department official who \u2019 s close to Hook , said that Hook \u2019 s time as the policy planning chief was a triumph . His greatest achievement was \u201c aligning the State Department with a Trump agenda , which was a 180-degree turn from what they had been used to for eight years \u201d under Obama .\n\u201c Policy planning was completely reinvented under Brian , \u201d another department official told me .\nBut when I asked other current and former officials the same question \u2014 did Hook have any major successes in the policy planning role ? \u2014 all responded with the same sentiment : none .\nIf any of Hook \u2019 s early troubles bothered top administration officials , though , it never showed . Trump fired Tillerson on March 13 , 2018 . Per three people familiar with the situation , Hook that same day received a call from Kushner in which the president \u2019 s son-in-law relayed that Hook \u2019 s job was safe .\n\u201c Political savvy is what it takes to survive in any presidential administration , but especially one like this with such high turnover , \u201d a person close to the envoy told me .\nAfter former CIA chief Mike Pompeo was confirmed as secretary of state in April 2018 , he immediately took off for a trip to the Middle East and Europe . Hook was on the plane , and they quickly formed a close partnership over Iran issues .\nHook , like many other Republicans , despised the Iran deal . He called it \u201c disastrous \u201d in a Weekly Standard article that came out just four months after the Obama administration made the July 2015 agreement with Tehran . And despite Hook \u2019 s work to get the Europeans to expand and strengthen the agreement , Pompeo knew Hook was just following Trump and Tillerson \u2019 s directive , people close to the situation told me .\nThat policy changed abruptly in May 2018 . \u201c We can not prevent an Iranian bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement , \u201d Trump said in a White House address . \u201c Therefore , I am announcing today that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal. \u201d Previously lifted sanctions fell back on Iran , and more would soon come .\nWeeks later , Pompeo gave a speech at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank in which he laid out 12 ways Iran needed to change before its relations with the US could improve .\nThe most important demands were for Iran to stop its support for proxy groups , like Hezbollah in Syria and Lebanon ; halt its missile program ; end all nuclear enrichment ; quit threatening US regional allies like Israel and Saudi Arabia ; and allow for international shipping to proceed unimpeded .\nThe chances of all of those things happening are slim to none , most experts say . But Pompeo named Hook the special representative for Iran policy in August 2018 , and so it became his job to try .\n\u201c The idea of having an envoy for Iran has been talked about for a long time , \u201d Suzanne Maloney , an Iran expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington , told me . \u201c It has real value because Iran is a crisis that takes up a lot of diplomatic time and energy , and often spans functional and regional directorates in a way that makes it difficult to have a full-scope policy . \u201d\nTaking that mantle would put Hook at the center of Trump \u2019 s foreign policy and the combustible Washington debate over how to handle Iran . Opinions differ widely , but two main lines of thought persist . On one hand , some say the US should \u2019 ve remained in the nuclear deal to keep the proliferation problem at bay and open up dialogue for improved relations . On the other hand , there \u2019 s a belief Iran won \u2019 t cow unless it feels immense economic pain . The Trump administration firmly believes in the latter .\nWith a \u201c maximum pressure \u201d campaign , the administration argues it can curtail the worst parts of Tehran \u2019 s foreign policy : its funding for terrorist organizations that wreak havoc in the Middle East and around the world ; Tehran \u2019 s stranglehold control over Iraq ; and attacks on US allies like Saudi Arabia .\nThat \u2019 s what Hook , and the team of roughly 20 to 30 people in what \u2019 s known as the Iran Action Group ( IAG ) , have aimed to prove . \u201c It was our job to define the contours of what \u2018 maximum pressure \u2019 looked like , \u201d a former senior State Department official told me , \u201c and then we had to develop and fill in the details . \u201d\nFill it in they have . In conjunction with the Treasury Department , State Department officials tell me the IAG has sanctioned more than 1,000 Iranian and other individuals \u2014 including leaders in Tehran \u2014 and entities like the military and oil sector . That means no one in the US can do business with them , and Washington has made it known it will come down hard on anyone else who tries to make deals with the Islamic Republic .\nHook and his team now begin each day by looking at a dashboard of Iran \u2019 s economic fundamentals \u2014 such as the value of the riad or oil exports \u2014 to see what effect their moves have had . They seem to have had quite an effect : A year and a half ago , when Hook took on this role , Iran was exporting 2.5 millions barrels per day of oil . That number is now down to half a million .\nThat \u2019 s a huge hit to Iran \u2019 s economy , as oil is central to its economic viability . The US-led pressure campaign has starved the Islamic Republic of an estimated $ 25 billion in oil revenue , per State \u2019 s estimates I obtained , and Hook \u2019 s team believes Iran \u2019 s economy will contract by around 14 percent this year .\nTo put it mildly , those numbers mean the country is \u2014 or is about to be \u2014 in a deep depression , and it doesn \u2019 t help that the country \u2019 s currency has lost 60 percent of its value against the US dollar . A senior State Department official told me a Middle Eastern foreign minister relayed to him that Javad Zarif , Iran \u2019 s top diplomat , recently said privately , \u201c We \u2019 re dying a slow death . \u201d\nAlireza Miryousefi , the top spokesperson for Iran \u2019 s mission at the UN , disputed that quote . \u201c We will not allow them to make us die in a slow death , \u201d Zarif said , according to Miryousefi .\nIran is clearly feeling the pain . The question , though , is whether the economic downturn will force Tehran \u2019 s hand . Some in Hook \u2019 s team believe Iran could collapse by the end of 2020 , three administration officials told me , and they \u2019 re convinced Tehran will come calling for a meeting soon .\n\u201c Just by surviving as long as he has , Brian has accomplished something . \u201d\nOthers believe things will get worse before they get better . They point to Iran \u2019 s increasingly violent regional escalation to get the US to back down . Tehran has bombed oil tankers , Saudi oil fields , and restarted critical parts of their once-shuttered nuclear program . And the country has cracked down brutally on recent widespread internal protests , despite global condemnation for its actions .\nSen. Kaine , a former Democratic vice presidential candidate , believes this is proof that the Hook-led maximum pressure campaign is failing . \u201c Iran feels existentially provoked , \u201d he told me . \u201c We could easily be like the Guns of August and blunder into a war that would be foolish to be in . \u201d\nHook \u2019 s loyalists beg to differ . \u201c We think our pressure is bigger than their resistance , and they think the opposite , \u201d a senior State Department official told me .\nRecently , Hook \u2019 s escalation campaign against Iran \u2019 s most important resource has become even more pointed .\nOn August 26 , Hook directly emailed an Indian ship captain piloting an Iranian oil tanker in international waters . \u201c This is Brian Hook , \u201d he wrote to Akhilesh Kumar . \u201c I work for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and serve as the US representative for Iran . I am writing with good news . \u201d\nHook explained that if Kumar took the ship to a country that would impound the vessel on America \u2019 s behalf , he would receive millions of dollars in compensation through the State Department \u2019 s Rewards for Justice program , which gives up to $ 15 million for information desired by the US .\nKumar wasn \u2019 t special , per se : Hook has emailed or called ship captains roughly a dozen times all in an effort to stop Iran from evading US-imposed sanctions .\n\u201c Iran knows that the success of our pressure campaign depends on vigorous enforcement of oil sanctions , \u201d Hook told the Financial Times in September . \u201c We have collapsed Iran \u2019 s oil exports in a short period of time . We are working very closely with the maritime community to disrupt and deter illicit oil exports . \u201d\nThat article and word of mouth have clearly raised awareness of Hook \u2019 s efforts . According to the State Department , the Rewards for Justice program has received over 23,000 tips on Iran during this administration , all hoping to receive some financial reward for information on Iran \u2019 s sanctions-evading practices . Specific rewards , though , are classified .\nCritics of the program , mainly Iranian officials like Zarif , say the plan is nothing less than \u201c outright blackmail . \u201d\nHook \u2019 s supporters , though , say he \u2019 s done a superb job getting the entire diplomatic apparatus to fall in line with the maximum pressure plan . \u201c Brian has completely turned a freighter around regarding America \u2019 s Iran policy , both literally and figuratively , \u201d Hammond , the top official in Tillerson \u2019 s State Department , told me .\nEven critics note that those accomplishments are impressive , but say the US still hasn \u2019 t done enough to crush Tehran as hoped . \u201c They \u2019 ll survive [ the economic pressure ] and they \u2019 ll make it difficult \u201d for the US , Eurasia Group Iran expert Henry Rome told me , \u201c especially because they want to build leverage for post-2020 negotiations. \u201d The regime may be helped in the short term by European countries working hard to maintain economic and business ties with Iran .\nIran , it seems , is prepared to wait out Trump and is showing its muscle to a future administration . Others agree : The Trump administration has \u201c really painted themselves into a corner , \u201d a department official told me .\nIn February , for example , the IAG hastily organized a two-day summit in Warsaw meant to recruit more than 60 countries to isolate Tehran as part of the maximum pressure campaign . It ended in total failure as the US isolated itself instead .\nAmong other embarrassments , the leaders of Germany , France , and the European Union \u2014 all members in the Iran nuclear deal \u2014 didn \u2019 t come , despite Hook \u2019 s invitation . Meanwhile , other European and Arab nations sent low-level delegates to the sessions .\nThat left top American officials , like Vice President Mike Pence and Pompeo , in an embarrassing position . Usually they would only attend events featuring their counterparts ; in this case , they flew all the way to Poland to hobnob with foreign leaders well below their stature .\nIt also didn \u2019 t help that Pence gave a fiery speech , lecturing the Europeans about giving Iran money , even though the accord they still adhere to allows it . It \u2019 s \u201c an ill-advised step that will only strengthen Iran , weaken the EU , and create still more distance between Europe and America , \u201d Pence said . Many in the audience were stunned , officials told me .\nThat conference and other woes didn \u2019 t keep Hook out of the running to replace John Bolton as national security adviser in September . Two people familiar with the situation said that Kushner pushed for Hook to get the job , though he ultimately lost out .\nThe admiration inside the administration , however , hasn \u2019 t totally translated to Capitol Hill . During an October Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing , Hook testified on Trump \u2019 s decision to withdraw US troops from Syria , abandoning long-time Kurdish allies and leading to Turkey \u2019 s incursion to kill them .\nSen. Mitt Romney ( R-UT ) , who Hook supported and advised during the 2012 presidential campaign , asked him if Iran would benefit from a lack of American presence and further chaos in the region . Hook could only respond with a non-answer . \u201c Our military is in Syria for ISIS , our diplomacy is focused on Iran , \u201d he said , noting his work on the \u201c pressure side \u201d dovetails with his colleagues \u2019 efforts to find a diplomatic solution in the country .\nRomney was incredulous . \u201c It \u2019 s astonishing that the Administration \u2019 s top Iran expert does not believe Turkey \u2019 s attacks on Kurds in Syria are a game changer in favor of Iran , \u201d he tweeted about the exchange . \u201c Kurds are now aligned with Assad , whose regime is backed by Iran ! \u201d\nIt \u2019 s astonishing that the Administration \u2019 s top Iran expert does not believe Turkey \u2019 s attacks on Kurds in Syria are a game changer in favor of Iran . Kurds are now aligned with Assad , whose regime is backed by Iran ! pic.twitter.com/R0d4Qad7HQ \u2014 Senator Mitt Romney ( @ SenatorRomney ) October 16 , 2019\nWhile he still has many allies on the Hill who admit to being huge Hook fans , some congressional Republicans tell me that that may have been Hook \u2019 s last official appearance in front of Congress in this administration . Between Tehran \u2019 s aggressive pushback and his role in Nowrouzzadeh \u2019 s ouster , they worry Democrats will trash him on camera . Others also admit that Hook isn \u2019 t that impressive on Iran policy even in private , which makes him expendable as far as they \u2019 re concerned .\nIndeed , Hook may have climbed to the top of Mount Trump , but it \u2019 s come at the cost of getting on the wrong side of his previously like-minded Republicans . If there was ever a moment to crystalize Hook \u2019 s journey , it was his dispute with Romney : Seven years earlier , he helped Romney devise an internationalist American foreign policy . Today , he \u2019 s an emblem of the Trump administration to the world \u2014 repping a foreign policy that some say is overly brash , overly aggressive , and overly haphazard .\nWhether or not he ultimately succeeds with Iran , many will forever peg him as a Trump guy . Only Hook knows whether it \u2019 s been worth it , but those who know him understand the situation he \u2019 s in .\n\u201c This has been an exceptionally difficult administration in which to serve , especially for people of quality , \u201d Feaver , Hook \u2019 s former associate , told me . \u201c Just by surviving as long as he has , Brian has accomplished something . \u201d",
    "content_original": "The way the wind whipped on the other end of the line, the State Department\u2019s special representative for Iran knew the man he\u2019d called was at sea.\n\n\u201cThis is Brian Hook,\u201d the American official said, his voice stern and direct. The connection wasn\u2019t great, and the swirling gusts made it hard for the Mediterranean shipping executive on the other end to hear him clearly.\n\n\u201cThis is Brian Hook from the State Department,\u201d the Iran envoy repeated, hoping his words would cut through the noise. With a hint of resignation in his voice, the shipping executive responded after a long pause, \u201cI know who you are.\u201d\n\nThen came the thrust of the conversation: Ensure your ships don\u2019t carry Iranian crude, said Hook, or that would defy the Trump administration\u2019s maximum pressure campaign against the Islamic Republic.\n\nBut to understand just why a high-ranking State Department official would jump on the phone with a shipping magnate, it helps to know a bit more about oil. In particular, Iranian oil.\n\nAccording to the latest estimates, Iran boasts the third- or fourth-largest oil reserves in the world. Even with obsolete extraction and refining technology, it\u2019s bursting with black gold. A find announced just this November added an estimated 53 billion barrels to what are called \u201crecoverable\u201d reserves \u2014 this one just 180 feet underground. Compared to, say, the complexity and challenge of pulling crude from deepwater drilling rigs in the North Sea or hydraulic fracking in North Dakota, this is basically like scooping oil from a sandbox.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising, then, that Iran\u2019s economy relies heavily upon crude exports. The problem is that exporting oil has been increasingly hard of late \u2014 and Iran\u2019s economy is in a parlous way.\n\nThe US government \u2014 under Hook\u2019s direction \u2014 has imposed a heavy toll of sanctions on Tehran, limiting the state\u2019s ability to conduct financial transactions, import goods, and sell its voluminous reserves of oil on the global market. But the Iranian government hasn\u2019t taken this lying down.\n\nSometimes tankers \u201cgo dark\u201d as they near Iranian ports, with captains disregarding international rules that require they divulge the ship\u2019s position and course. Sometimes Iran employs ship-to-ship transfers \u2014 transferring cargo to another seagoing vessel \u2014 to make the goods harder to track. And other times the Islamic Republic, or others doing business with it, will forge paperwork to hide what\u2019s being exported.\n\nBut when Hook gets a tip, he likes to know other important players have the same information. And recently, the envoy has been busy, reaching out directly to a handful of high-powered maritime leaders and at least a dozen ship captains to convince them \u2014 through a mixture of threats and financial incentives \u2014 not to do business with Iran. \u201cWe are trying to dry up their labor pool to move illicit oil,\u201d a US official told the Financial Times of the outreach.\n\nThe shipping world, then, knows about the bookish lawyer-turned-diplomat. But you\u2019d be forgiven if you\u2019ve never heard of him. Until recently, most people hadn\u2019t.\n\nOne of the most important foreign policy officials in the Trump administration, the 51-year-old Iowa native has helped design the administration\u2019s new strategy toward Asia and North Korea. He has a hand in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. And he\u2019s close to Trump\u2019s inner circle, especially senior White House adviser and presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nAnd for over a year now, he\u2019s been serving as the US special representative for Iran, spearheading the president\u2019s campaign against the country \u2014 placing crushing sanctions on the Islamic Republic\u2019s economy to compel it to negotiate a new nuclear deal with America and thoroughly change its behavior.\n\n\ufeffTrump and Pompeo may be the faces of US foreign policy, then, but Hook is the one working behind the scenes to turn the president\u2019s scattershot impulses into a meaningful strategy toward the country.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the translator,\u201d said R.C. Hammond, a former top Trump State Department official and Hook friend.\n\nOnce a Trump critic, Hook served as a senior official in the George W. Bush administration, a top adviser to Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign, and a confidante of former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. That he worked his way from the heart of the Republican establishment to lead a nontraditional Republican\u2019s signature foreign policy remains stunning to many.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a survivor,\u201d said a State Department official who, like others interviewed for this story, requested anonymity to speak freely about a colleague.\n\nHis survival, though, is now under threat. Current and former State employees \u2014 many of whom worked with or for Hook \u2014 complain the top diplomat ignores them or shuts them out completely. A State Department report detailed how Hook pushed out a staffer over outside conservative pressure for bigoted and partisan reasons, a conclusion he fiercely denies.\n\nIt all adds fodder for his many critics in Congress who say his grasp of Iran policy is rudimentary and overly aggressive. \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of his,\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees, told me. \u201cHe is like a John Bolton type: bellicose first, analyze later, if at all, then justify the bellicose actions we take as necessary. I don\u2019t think his assessment of the Iran situation shows much real-world connection.\u201d\n\nEven certain congressional Republicans agree, telling me Hook\u2019s personnel problems make it impossible for him to testify in front of Congress again. \u201cHe\u2019ll get eaten alive,\u201d said a senior aide to a Republican senator, noting many top GOP lawmakers and Trump allies still support the envoy.\n\nIf things in Washington aren\u2019t all warm and fuzzy for Hook, it\u2019s not all roses out in the world, either. Hook organized a disastrous international conference that isolated America more than Iran, critics say. Europeans didn\u2019t accede to his demands to reform the nuclear deal as the administration initially wanted. Despite the strain on the regime, Tehran lashed out violently to America\u2019s withdrawal of the Iran deal by bombing oil fields in Saudi Arabia and restarting its nuclear program. In recent weeks, the government has cracked down on protesters demanding new leadership, killing at least 180 people and perhaps hundreds more.\n\nTehran\u2019s actions, some fear, could set it on a collision course with Washington that could turn into a disastrous war.\n\nThrough it all, Hook has stayed out of the limelight, instead finding a place steps from the secretary of state\u2019s office and in the heart of the Trump administration. \u201cWe\u2019re putting Iran at the center of everything,\u201d a State Department official told me, \u201cwhich puts Hook at the center of everything.\u201d That makes understanding Hook vital to understanding Trump\u2019s foreign policy today \u2014 and what it could mean for Iran heading into a critical year.\n\nThis account of Hook\u2019s career, including his three years at the top of President Trump\u2019s foreign policy team, is based on interviews with nearly 20 current and former US officials, congressional members and staff, experts, and people close to him.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s figure it out when you get in\u201d\n\nThe son of a banker, Hook grew up a staunch Catholic with an eye for politics. As a teenager, he watched The McLaughlin Group every Sunday and was dazzled by conservative icon William F. Buckley Jr. Once in college, he called Buckley\u2019s agent to express admiration and received an invite to watch the firebrand speak in Bemidji, Minnesota, after which Hook got to eat dinner with the commentator.\n\nThey became quick friends, going on sailing trips and holding deep conversations about their Catholic faith, the music of Bach, and books \u2014 anything besides politics. Buckley left those conversations for his op-eds and television appearances. Hook admired that Buckley\u2019s life was larger than politics, and it\u2019s a code the husband and father of three tries to live by in his personal life, those close to him say.\n\nBut Hook still pined for politics. He got his first chance in the 1990s, when he worked as a legislative aide to both Iowa Rep. James Leach and Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad (now the US ambassador to China) while attending law school. Those who knew him then said he showed an aptitude for public service. After graduating from law school at the University of Iowa in 1999, Hook moved to Washington \u2014 but to practice corporate law at the private firm of Hogan and Hartson.\n\nWorking in the nation\u2019s capital, Hook increasingly immersed in the political world, and in 2003 joined the Department of Justice under President Bush. He quickly climbed the ladder, serving as a special adviser to the president on policy, where Hook learned the high-stakes and quick tempo operations of the White House. At the United Nations as a special adviser to the ambassador, he gained familiarity with the intricacies of diplomacy, sanctions policy, human rights, and Iran.\n\nHe then became the acting assistant secretary of state for international organizations in June 2008, receiving an official confirmation by the Senate that October \u2014 four months before Barack Obama was sworn in as president. \u201cThe fact that he got confirmed so late in the Bush administration shows the strong bipartisan relationships he has,\u201d Kristen Silverberg, Hook\u2019s immediate predecessor in that role, told me.\n\nThose close to Hook attribute that to his outwardly warm, affable demeanor. \u201cHe\u2019s political, but not partisan,\u201d a person close to Hook told me.\n\nHis thirst for politics didn\u2019t end when he left government at the end of the Bush administration in 2009. He got to work as the foreign policy adviser for Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty\u2019s presidential run. When Pawlenty\u2019s campaign ended, Hook moved over to become a senior adviser on Mitt Romney\u2019s team, helping him shape the eventual Republican nominee\u2019s worldview.\n\nThat campaign cycle had an unusual focus on foreign policy. Romney repeatedly assailed Obama\u2019s record with the usual Republican talking points: He was weak on terrorism, Russia, North Korea, and Iran; he embraced dictators instead of allies; and he shied away from using US military power abroad \u2014 particularly in the Middle East \u2014 over fears of embroiling the US in another war.\n\nThose arguments, though, weren\u2019t quite enough to convince voters to dislodge the incumbent. After Romney lost, Hook, along with his campaign colleagues Eliot Cohen and Eric Edelman, felt they should stick together to keep Romney\u2019s internationalism alive and groom the next generation of Republican foreign policy leaders.\n\nThey founded the John Hay Initiative, a think tank and advisory group promoting that internationalist vision, in 2013. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to build the bench\u201d of new Republican foreign policy leaders, Hook told the Wall Street Journal in 2015.\n\nPeter Feaver, a former Bush administration official who worked for Hook at John Hay, described him as \u201ccharming\u201d and \u201cserious,\u201d adding that Hook \u201cisn\u2019t the kind of sharp-elbowed, sharp-tongued player you encounter in Washington.\u201d That served Hook well when handling the political side of the group\u2019s operations, some said, as he worked contacts in Congress and attracted donors. He managed to do all that while also running his own international consulting firm, Latitude, and engaging in humanitarian projects like improving refugee housing conditions and women\u2019s health in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThen came candidate Trump and his \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy. It was anathema to much of what the initiative stood for. Cohen, Hook\u2019s co-lead at John Hay, orchestrated the March 2016 release of a letter signed by 122 GOP foreign policy experts, all agreeing they were \u201cunited in our opposition to a Donald Trump presidency.\u201d It was one of multiple statements made by so-called \u201cNever Trumpers\u201d who argued the candidate\u2019s stances were dangerous for the country.\n\nHook seemingly felt the same way: \u201cEven if you say you support him as the nominee,\u201d he told Politico in 2016, \u201cyou go down the list of his positions and you see you disagree on every one.\u201d\n\nBut Hook didn\u2019t sign Cohen\u2019s Never Trump letter \u2014 or any other public declaration against candidate Trump. The reason, according to those familiar with his thinking, was a mix of patriotism and worry about his future prospects. \u201cHe\u2019s not a letter signer,\u201d a person close to him told me. \u201cHe wants people to serve their country.\u201d\n\nThat reticence, or patriotism, allowed Hook\u2019s friend Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey and one-time presidential candidate, to pull Hook into the Trump transition team. His name was floated for a top administration job, but it was unclear what exactly it might be.\n\nHook \u201cisn\u2019t the kind of sharp-elbowed, sharp-tongued player you encounter in Washington.\u201d\n\nIt became more apparent the day before Trump\u2019s inauguration. On January 19, 2017, the president\u2019s pick for secretary of state, then-Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson, held a one-hour meeting with Hook in which they discussed how the administration might run foreign policy. The two men didn\u2019t know each other, but by the end, Hook was offered the job as director of policy planning in the State Department and Tillerson\u2019s chief foreign policy adviser.\n\nHook asked his soon-to-be boss what, exactly, would be expected of him in the role. Tillerson, according to a senior department official, simply replied, \u201cLet\u2019s figure it out when you get in.\u201d\n\nHook was integral to \u201chow the building ran\u201d early in Trump\u2019s presidency\n\nThe policy planning office (known internally as S/P) is akin to the State Department\u2019s in-house think tank. Filled with career staffers that span multiple administrations, it\u2019s an office for long-term thinking on nearly every challenge facing the country. Whoever leads this team helps set the course of US foreign policy for years, and previous officeholders include prominent figures like George Kennan, Anne-Marie Slaughter, and Richard Haass.\n\nHook\u2019s arrival as director was encouraging for many in the policy office. \u201cThere was a lot of optimism on the team when he joined,\u201d a former State Department official who worked with Hook told me. \u201cWe thought he\u2019d be very helpful since he was at State before, knew how the building worked, and would respect career staff in a way the administration hadn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThat hope faded fast for many.\n\nCurrent and former staffers told me that Hook didn\u2019t hold a staff meeting for at least his first six weeks in the building. Employees reporting directly to him, many working on top issues like Iran and North Korea, didn\u2019t know what their new boss wanted from them. \u201cThere was no direction, no blueprint in terms of how he wanted things to run and what he expected,\u201d one former staffer told me. \u201cColleagues were fighting for work and spent most of their time in the cafeteria with nothing to do.\u201d\n\nThat, in large part, was a function of the broader chaos inside the State Department. While most incoming administrations have teams of people lined up to hit the ground running on Inauguration Day, the Trump administration spent months without top diplomats in place. Other than Tillerson and his deputy, John Sullivan, no other Senate-confirmed appointee at the undersecretary or assistant secretary level came into office for many months, meaning Hook had to spend days and weeks away from his team to travel with Tillerson or brief the White House on policy.\n\nHook prefers to work in tight teams, State Department officials told me, and he frequently held small-group meetings in his office on North Korea, Iran, China, and ISIS. Those who worked on topics not on the president\u2019s priority list didn\u2019t get much face time with the boss. Hook likes \u201cgo-getters,\u201d said a senior department official, and it was up to someone leading a non-priority portfolio to make the case for why they should pay more attention to their issue.\n\nStaffers who got to interact often with Hook, though, came away with a good impression. \u201cAll those willing to offer ideas, written products, and support the process were given meaningful and substantive roles,\u201d said a current department official in an email. \u201cThis was a meritocracy: excellent written products, fresh ideas, and energy were rewarded.\u201d Hook \u201cconnected with the secretary and started building a staff process appropriate to his and the interagency\u2019s needs.\u201d\n\nFurther, the official offered a theory for why so much ire was reserved for Hook. \u201cThose folks were not inclined toward constructive and receptive team-building with the incoming secretary and key secretary assistants. This created in S/P a sort of professionally neutral group ready to build bridges with incoming leadership and row hard in a new direction, and a defend-existing-policy/resist change group.\u201d\n\nThat would reflect a general sentiment inside the State Department. There was widespread disillusionment among the ranks \u2014 people were suspicious of Trump and his pick, Tillerson. But even among the Trump believers, the highest-level officials didn\u2019t have the necessary political support to do their jobs.\n\nTillerson, for example, was an outsider who hadn\u2019t met Trump before being tapped to lead the building. He only came to Trump\u2019s attention after top Bush administration officials, like former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and former National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley \u2014 both of whom had ties to ExxonMobil \u2014 pushed for his appointment.\n\nBetween the vacancies and general chaos, Hook quickly rose to the top of the administration\u2019s foreign policy team. \u201cTillerson, [State Department Chief of Staff Margaret] Peterlin, and Hook \u2014 that\u2019s how the building ran\u201d early on, a State Department official told me.\n\n\u201cKilling ants with a sledgehammer\u201d\n\nHook\u2019s biggest assignment, a directive from the president and the secretary of state, was to convince America\u2019s European allies to reform the Iran deal, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA.\n\nThe negotiated 2015 accord \u2014 signed by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, plus Germany, the EU, and of course, Iran \u2014 lifted sanctions on Tehran in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear program and invasive monitoring of facilities. It was one of Obama\u2019s signature foreign policy achievements, heralded by Democrats as a historic diplomatic moment and lambasted by Republicans as naive capitulation.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump called it \u201cthe stupidest deal of all time,\u201d seemingly because it didn\u2019t do anything to address Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program or support for terrorism in the region, and because it included a time limit for when the restrictions on its nuclear program would end. He vowed to get the US out of the deal on his first day as president.\n\nBut in office, Trump administration officials \u2014 many of whom believed the US should remain in the deal, flawed though it may have been \u2014 set out to try to negotiate a new side agreement that would address those concerns and keep America in the Iran deal. To do so, the US would first need to get the Europeans on board.\n\nHook spent months criss-crossing the Atlantic trying to negotiate an enhanced agreement, knowing that Trump\u2019s patience with the endeavor was limited.\n\n\u201cIn the event we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated,\u201d Trump said in an October 2017 speech on Iran strategy. \u201cIt is under continuous review, and our participation can be canceled by me, as president, at any time.\u201d\n\nThe Europeans wouldn\u2019t budge, State Department officials told me, because they wanted to stay true to the already-signed agreement and they had business interests in Iran. Whenever Hook would send documents to his European counterparts with language about removing end dates on the nuclear restrictions, they would come back with bright red lines straight through them, a senior department official told me.\n\nToughening the deal remained administration policy through at least February 2018, when Hook spoke at a Duke University event moderated by Feaver, a professor there and his former colleague at the John Hay Initiative. \u201cI know the logic that he was pursuing, and I genuinely believe he was trying to get a deal and to get the Europeans to toughen and sweeten their part to get better leverage on Iran,\u201d Feaver confided. \u201cThe approach was clearly \u2018Let\u2019s fix the Iran deal from inside.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t work. During an April 2018 Oval Office meeting, French President Emmanuel Macron tried to convince Trump that Europe was close to agreeing to a Hook-brokered deal in an effort to keep the Obama-era agreement in place \u2014 which some US officials suspected was a ruse to placate Trump.\n\nTrump, however, didn\u2019t seem to know his own administration\u2019s foreign policy was to revamp the Iran deal or even who was leading that effort. Trump\u2019s first reaction to Macron\u2019s plea for a bit more time was: \u201cWho\u2019s Brian Hook?\u201d He pulled the US out of the Iran deal the following month.\n\nHook still had his admirers in the White House, though, even if he wasn\u2019t a household name in the Oval Office. The White House requested his presence often to brief advisers, mainly Stephen Miller and Jared Kushner, on policy, as well as to attend other normal foreign policy meetings.\n\n\u201cHe was at the White House all the time,\u201d a State Department official told me. \u201cThe White House would call and tell him to come over, and he would oblige.\u201d Kushner, Miller, and Hook grew close during those many briefings, giving the department leader allies close to the president.\n\nHook\u2019s defenders say his deference to the White House is defensible. Few knew if they were valued by a mercurial president, and the actions of many top officials could be explained \u2014 if not forgiven \u2014 mostly by their will to survive in the administration. When the president\u2019s team calls, you come running, and Hook\u2019s phone rang often due to the State Department\u2019s many vacancies. He was \u201cthe guy\u201d because he was the only guy around.\n\nOthers, though, claim Hook enjoyed his proximity to power. \u201cHe got excited when he got to go to Mar-a-Lago for a weekend,\u201d another former State Department employee told me. \u201cHe was really diving in as much as he could with the new team, and that was his only focus.\u201d\n\nAs Hook grew closer to the White House, some career officials in his team suffered. When a high-level Western European delegation came to meet with Hook in February 2017, no one in the State Department knew about the gathering until that country\u2019s embassy called the relevant desk officer hours before they got to the building. That staffer then contacted the policy planning office to ask if they could send someone to take notes.\n\n\u201cWe kind of scrambled and asked Brian if someone other than him could be in the meeting. He agreed, but the sense was he did it to placate us,\u201d a former department official told me. \u201cI don\u2019t think he trusted his staff. There was a feeling that he was trying to shut us out.\u201d\n\nFor some, that sense of alienation became clearer when Hook assigned two Pentagon detailees to run a project on how to redesign policymaking inside the State Department. Hook entrusted the military officers with the task due to their previous management and planning experience, but it still felt odd to long-time State Department employees to ask military officials to remake years of department operations. They\u2019d already been affronted by the bevy of consulting firms brought in by Tillerson to revamp the building\u2019s processes.\n\n\u201cIt was a like a civilian going into a war room and telling people how to invade.\u201d\n\nThe final proposal, per five people familiar with the situation, was that Hook\u2019s team would lead all policy generation on everything \u2014 not just Iran. Afterward, Hook would bring options to Tillerson and his top lieutenants for their approval. The accepted plans would then \u201ctrickle down,\u201d in the words of one person, from leadership \u2014 including the policy planning office \u2014 to the rest of the bureaus for implementation.\n\nIn other words, it would give Hook more power.\n\nThat idea wasn\u2019t overly radical, though. Policy planning directors in the past, including during the Obama administration, wielded immense influence over crafting and executing foreign policy. And despite the extensive expertise throughout the State Department offices in Washington and embassies around the world, it\u2019s not unheard of for the secretary to set policy without much input and have staffers execute it.\n\nTillerson also wanted a bigger say in how his building created policy proposals in top-level administration discussions, especially since he was surrounded by Cabinet officials, like then-Defense Secretary James Mattis, who had immense experience and early influence on the president. Trump constantly boasted about having \u201chis generals\u201d by his side; Tillerson, by contrast, was kept at arm\u2019s length. So Hook, according to multiple officials, wanted to give the boss a proposal to satisfy his strong preference for greater influence in US foreign policy.\n\nMany on Hook\u2019s team agreed there was (and remains) room to streamline and improve the building\u2019s processes, but what the military planners devised at Hook\u2019s request unsettled his employees.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of having all these experts in your building if you have all these closed-circuit proposals?\u201d one former official told me. A current staffer expressed incredulity in more colorful language: \u201cIt was like a civilian going into a war room and telling people how to invade. Sure, trim the fat, but that was like killing ants with a sledgehammer.\u201d The proposal, like many of Tillerson\u2019s reforms, never went into place.\n\nTillerson continued to entrust his top lieutenants with foreign policymaking, and much of the building felt sidelined by his leadership style. It wasn\u2019t just bureaucratic hiccups or sour grapes that angered staffers in his charge, which could be understandable for a new boss in a tumultuous administration. Hook early on became embroiled in a scandal that has put a black mark on his time in government and possibly his future career.\n\nBrian Hook vs. Sahar Nowrouzzadeh\n\nA civil service employee who handled the Iran and Gulf country portfolios for the policy planning team, Sahar Nowrouzzadeh joined the US government in 2005 during the George W. Bush administration. During the Obama years, she helped craft the nuclear deal from inside the White House, an accord that Republicans en masse despised.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing that unifies Republicans, it\u2019s that the Iran deal was not a good deal for security and non-proliferation,\u201d said Silverberg, Hook\u2019s predecessor at the State Department\u2019s international organizations bureau and now a top executive at the Business Roundtable.\n\nAs Trump came to power, his loyalists looked for any signs that \u201cdeep state\u201d operatives were conspiring against the president. The paranoia grew as the administration early on suffered leaks about the president\u2019s conduct and mishaps throughout the government. The White House was also obsessed with this notion of a bureaucratic attempt to destroy Trump \u2014 a message that fit with his stated desire to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of entrenched, unelected officials thwarting the movement he led.\n\nTrump allies began to attack US officials suspected of anti-Trump sentiments. Nowrouzzadeh soon found herself directly in the crosshairs. Not only had she worked on the Iran deal in the Obama administration, but her Iranian heritage raised eyebrows \u2014 even though she was born in the United States. Articles in Breitbart and elsewhere claimed she had cried after Trump won the election and unfailingly cited her previous work for the National Iranian American Council, which some say is close to the country\u2019s regime. Nowrouzzadeh, her backers note, was just an intern there.\n\nThe anti-Nowrouzzadeh campaign soon reached a high-powered audience. Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and current Trump booster, sent to multiple State Department officials \u2014 including Peterlin, Tillerson\u2019s chief of staff \u2014 a March 14, 2017, Conservative Review article claiming she had \u201cburrowed into the government under President Trump.\u201d\n\nA report by the State Department\u2019s inspector general, released in November after months of investigating Hook\u2019s conduct toward Nowrouzzadeh, provides extensive detail on what happened next.\n\nHook received the Conservative Review article and sent it to a career staffer and his deputy, Ed Lacey. When Hook asked Lacey about Nowrouzzadeh, Lacey said that many people working in the policy planning staff were Obama holdovers.\n\n\u201cTheir picks\u201d \u2014 meaning who was chosen to work in the office during the Obama administration \u2014 \u201cwithout exception, were Obama/Clinton loyalists not at all supportive of President Trump\u2019s foreign policy agenda,\u201d Lacey emailed, adding that \u201call of these detailees have tried to stay on\u201d the team. \u201cEd \u2013 This is helpful. Let\u2019s discuss on Monday,\u201d Hook replied.\n\nThat was a change of tune for Lacey, who only days before Trump\u2019s inauguration had only great things to say about Nowrouzzadeh.\n\n\u201cSahar\u2019s performance as a Member of the Secretary of State\u2019s Policy Planning Staff (S/P) over the rating period [from July 2016 to that point] has been first rate and has exceeded by far the standards expected of a foreign affairs officer of her grade,\u201d Lacey wrote to another State Department staffer in a performance review I obtained that has not been previously reported.\n\n\u201cShe is exceptionally well positioned to continue to excel at her position, and should be looked upon very favorably for a promotion as soon as possible so that she can make full use of her talents going forward,\u201d Lacey concluded.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why Lacey\u2019s opinion of Nowrouzzadeh changed so sharply with Hook at the helm. What is clear, however, is that Hook \u2014 with Lacey\u2019s help \u2014 wanted to replace her, despite no concrete evidence she did anything to stymie Hook\u2019s policies or Trump\u2019s Iran strategy.\n\nSeveral State Department officials saw Nowrouzzadeh go into Hook\u2019s office on March 20, 2017, in an effort they say was to seek his help against the broadsides. It\u2019s unclear what happened during that one-on-one session, but some told me they saw the staffer immediately afterward in her office and noticed she had been crying.\n\nThen in April, Lacey wrote an email to Hook in which he said another department official \u201casked me to initiate the process of wrapping up [Nowrouzzadeh\u2019s] detail. ... Unless I hear otherwise from you, I will do so today.\u201d Hook simply responded, \u201cYes I agree,\u201d and Lacey then let Nowrouzzadeh go. She formally filed her complaint in May, detailing how unfairly she thought her reassignment was handled.\n\nAccording to several people familiar with the situation and the IG\u2019s report, Lacey told Nowrouzzadeh she was being removed from her role on the Policy Planning Staff because someone else was coming in to handle Iranian affairs. However, that new person \u2014 who didn\u2019t know Hook personally \u2014 didn\u2019t arrive until months later, indicating that a normal staffing change wasn\u2019t the main reason for her reassignment.\n\n\u201cEmployee One\u2019s [Nowrouzzadeh\u2019s] detail ... ended on or about April 17, 2017, although it was scheduled to end on or about July 4. Mr. McInnis, the replacement Schedule C appointee to cover S/P\u2019s Iran work, started in September 2017,\u201d the IG\u2019s report reads.\n\nHook, I was told by two State Department officials, never said a word to Nowrouzzadeh after her dismissal.\n\nHook got a chance to counter the IG\u2019s conclusion in the report. \u201cI did not \u2018acquiesce to pressure\u2019 to use non-merit factors,\u201d he responded. \u201cMy personnel decision was lawful, proper, and within the administrative standards for the Department of State.\u201d He added that once he started work as policy planning chief in February, he already \u201cintended to hire my own expert for Iran and the Gulf.\u201d\n\nHook is still pleading his case. According to a senior administration official, he\u2019s telling State Department officials that the IG report was biased against him and faulty from the start. He is considering some sort of direct action against the IG office\u2019s staff, but it\u2019s unclear what that exactly may be.\n\nFurther, Hook argues he couldn\u2019t have been biased against Nowrouzzadeh since the two of them didn\u2019t interact until that late March meeting, going so far as to say she never sent him a substantive email. But two State Department officials \u2014 one current and one former \u2014 say that they saw \u201cmultiple\u201d emails she sent to Hook featuring substantive policy issues on Iran. Many of those emails contained classified information.\n\nHook\u2019s defenders also insist he did everything by the book and that he had the absolute right to form the team he wanted. Nowrouzzadeh, as a holdover from the Obama administration, just didn\u2019t gel, they say. Hook felt he knew the Iran portfolio well enough and that Nowrouzzadeh wasn\u2019t a \u201cgo-getter,\u201d anyway. What\u2019s more, they note, the IG report doesn\u2019t cite a single interview or document that directly ties Hook to forcing out Nowrouzzadeh for bigoted or political reasons.\n\nTom Shannon, who until February 2018 served as Trump\u2019s undersecretary of state for policy \u2014 the State Department\u2019s third highest-ranking position \u2014 told me those arguments don\u2019t hold water. \u201cI saw her in several instances at the White House and State, and she\u2019s an absolute professional,\u201d he said. \u201cShe completely dominates the subject matter that she works on.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s offensive to hear her characterized as somehow a slouch, and I think it reflects very poorly on those who are doing this,\u201d he continued.\n\nNowrouzzadeh\u2019s colleagues were alarmed by what they saw \u2014 not only because of what happened, but also because of what they feared might happen to them. \u201cMorale plummeted,\u201d said a current State Department staffer, \u201cand people started jumping ship.\u201d\n\nHook\u2019s supporters tell a different story. Some people I spoke to said that spirits in the entire policy planning outfit vastly improved after those initial months. Full staff meetings resumed, communication flowed, and Hook\u2019s high profile made the team\u2019s work extremely important and valued. One person even said they were \u201cstoked\u201d to be in that office.\n\nHammond, the former top State Department official who\u2019s close to Hook, said that Hook\u2019s time as the policy planning chief was a triumph. His greatest achievement was \u201caligning the State Department with a Trump agenda, which was a 180-degree turn from what they had been used to for eight years\u201d under Obama.\n\n\u201cPolicy planning was completely reinvented under Brian,\u201d another department official told me.\n\nBut when I asked other current and former officials the same question \u2014 did Hook have any major successes in the policy planning role? \u2014 all responded with the same sentiment: none.\n\nIf any of Hook\u2019s early troubles bothered top administration officials, though, it never showed. Trump fired Tillerson on March 13, 2018. Per three people familiar with the situation, Hook that same day received a call from Kushner in which the president\u2019s son-in-law relayed that Hook\u2019s job was safe.\n\n\u201cPolitical savvy is what it takes to survive in any presidential administration, but especially one like this with such high turnover,\u201d a person close to the envoy told me.\n\nHook takes over as Trump\u2019s Iran envoy\n\nAfter former CIA chief Mike Pompeo was confirmed as secretary of state in April 2018, he immediately took off for a trip to the Middle East and Europe. Hook was on the plane, and they quickly formed a close partnership over Iran issues.\n\nHook, like many other Republicans, despised the Iran deal. He called it \u201cdisastrous\u201d in a Weekly Standard article that came out just four months after the Obama administration made the July 2015 agreement with Tehran. And despite Hook\u2019s work to get the Europeans to expand and strengthen the agreement, Pompeo knew Hook was just following Trump and Tillerson\u2019s directive, people close to the situation told me.\n\nThat policy changed abruptly in May 2018. \u201cWe cannot prevent an Iranian bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement,\u201d Trump said in a White House address. \u201cTherefore, I am announcing today that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.\u201d Previously lifted sanctions fell back on Iran, and more would soon come.\n\nWeeks later, Pompeo gave a speech at the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank in which he laid out 12 ways Iran needed to change before its relations with the US could improve.\n\nThe most important demands were for Iran to stop its support for proxy groups, like Hezbollah in Syria and Lebanon; halt its missile program; end all nuclear enrichment; quit threatening US regional allies like Israel and Saudi Arabia; and allow for international shipping to proceed unimpeded.\n\nThe chances of all of those things happening are slim to none, most experts say. But Pompeo named Hook the special representative for Iran policy in August 2018, and so it became his job to try.\n\n\u201cThe idea of having an envoy for Iran has been talked about for a long time,\u201d Suzanne Maloney, an Iran expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington, told me. \u201cIt has real value because Iran is a crisis that takes up a lot of diplomatic time and energy, and often spans functional and regional directorates in a way that makes it difficult to have a full-scope policy.\u201d\n\nTaking that mantle would put Hook at the center of Trump\u2019s foreign policy and the combustible Washington debate over how to handle Iran. Opinions differ widely, but two main lines of thought persist. On one hand, some say the US should\u2019ve remained in the nuclear deal to keep the proliferation problem at bay and open up dialogue for improved relations. On the other hand, there\u2019s a belief Iran won\u2019t cow unless it feels immense economic pain. The Trump administration firmly believes in the latter.\n\nWith a \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign, the administration argues it can curtail the worst parts of Tehran\u2019s foreign policy: its funding for terrorist organizations that wreak havoc in the Middle East and around the world; Tehran\u2019s stranglehold control over Iraq; and attacks on US allies like Saudi Arabia.\n\nThat\u2019s what Hook, and the team of roughly 20 to 30 people in what\u2019s known as the Iran Action Group (IAG), have aimed to prove. \u201cIt was our job to define the contours of what \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 looked like,\u201d a former senior State Department official told me, \u201cand then we had to develop and fill in the details.\u201d\n\nFill it in they have. In conjunction with the Treasury Department, State Department officials tell me the IAG has sanctioned more than 1,000 Iranian and other individuals \u2014 including leaders in Tehran \u2014 and entities like the military and oil sector. That means no one in the US can do business with them, and Washington has made it known it will come down hard on anyone else who tries to make deals with the Islamic Republic.\n\nHook and his team now begin each day by looking at a dashboard of Iran\u2019s economic fundamentals \u2014 such as the value of the riad or oil exports \u2014 to see what effect their moves have had. They seem to have had quite an effect: A year and a half ago, when Hook took on this role, Iran was exporting 2.5 millions barrels per day of oil. That number is now down to half a million.\n\nThat\u2019s a huge hit to Iran\u2019s economy, as oil is central to its economic viability. The US-led pressure campaign has starved the Islamic Republic of an estimated $25 billion in oil revenue, per State\u2019s estimates I obtained, and Hook\u2019s team believes Iran\u2019s economy will contract by around 14 percent this year.\n\nTo put it mildly, those numbers mean the country is \u2014 or is about to be \u2014 in a deep depression, and it doesn\u2019t help that the country\u2019s currency has lost 60 percent of its value against the US dollar. A senior State Department official told me a Middle Eastern foreign minister relayed to him that Javad Zarif, Iran\u2019s top diplomat, recently said privately, \u201cWe\u2019re dying a slow death.\u201d\n\nAlireza Miryousefi, the top spokesperson for Iran\u2019s mission at the UN, disputed that quote. \u201cWe will not allow them to make us die in a slow death,\u201d Zarif said, according to Miryousefi.\n\nIran is clearly feeling the pain. The question, though, is whether the economic downturn will force Tehran\u2019s hand. Some in Hook\u2019s team believe Iran could collapse by the end of 2020, three administration officials told me, and they\u2019re convinced Tehran will come calling for a meeting soon.\n\n\u201cJust by surviving as long as he has, Brian has accomplished something.\u201d\n\nOthers believe things will get worse before they get better. They point to Iran\u2019s increasingly violent regional escalation to get the US to back down. Tehran has bombed oil tankers, Saudi oil fields, and restarted critical parts of their once-shuttered nuclear program. And the country has cracked down brutally on recent widespread internal protests, despite global condemnation for its actions.\n\nSen. Kaine, a former Democratic vice presidential candidate, believes this is proof that the Hook-led maximum pressure campaign is failing. \u201cIran feels existentially provoked,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe could easily be like the Guns of August and blunder into a war that would be foolish to be in.\u201d\n\nHook\u2019s loyalists beg to differ. \u201cWe think our pressure is bigger than their resistance, and they think the opposite,\u201d a senior State Department official told me.\n\nRecently, Hook\u2019s escalation campaign against Iran\u2019s most important resource has become even more pointed.\n\n\u201cI am writing with good news\u201d\n\nOn August 26, Hook directly emailed an Indian ship captain piloting an Iranian oil tanker in international waters. \u201cThis is Brian Hook ,\u201d he wrote to Akhilesh Kumar. \u201cI work for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and serve as the US representative for Iran. I am writing with good news.\u201d\n\nHook explained that if Kumar took the ship to a country that would impound the vessel on America\u2019s behalf, he would receive millions of dollars in compensation through the State Department\u2019s Rewards for Justice program, which gives up to $15 million for information desired by the US.\n\nKumar wasn\u2019t special, per se: Hook has emailed or called ship captains roughly a dozen times all in an effort to stop Iran from evading US-imposed sanctions.\n\n\u201cIran knows that the success of our pressure campaign depends on vigorous enforcement of oil sanctions,\u201d Hook told the Financial Times in September. \u201cWe have collapsed Iran\u2019s oil exports in a short period of time. We are working very closely with the maritime community to disrupt and deter illicit oil exports.\u201d\n\nThat article and word of mouth have clearly raised awareness of Hook\u2019s efforts. According to the State Department, the Rewards for Justice program has received over 23,000 tips on Iran during this administration, all hoping to receive some financial reward for information on Iran\u2019s sanctions-evading practices. Specific rewards, though, are classified.\n\nCritics of the program, mainly Iranian officials like Zarif, say the plan is nothing less than \u201coutright blackmail.\u201d\n\nHook\u2019s supporters, though, say he\u2019s done a superb job getting the entire diplomatic apparatus to fall in line with the maximum pressure plan. \u201cBrian has completely turned a freighter around regarding America\u2019s Iran policy, both literally and figuratively,\u201d Hammond, the top official in Tillerson\u2019s State Department, told me.\n\nEven critics note that those accomplishments are impressive, but say the US still hasn\u2019t done enough to crush Tehran as hoped. \u201cThey\u2019ll survive [the economic pressure] and they\u2019ll make it difficult\u201d for the US, Eurasia Group Iran expert Henry Rome told me, \u201cespecially because they want to build leverage for post-2020 negotiations.\u201d The regime may be helped in the short term by European countries working hard to maintain economic and business ties with Iran.\n\nIran, it seems, is prepared to wait out Trump and is showing its muscle to a future administration. Others agree: The Trump administration has \u201creally painted themselves into a corner,\u201d a department official told me.\n\nIn February, for example, the IAG hastily organized a two-day summit in Warsaw meant to recruit more than 60 countries to isolate Tehran as part of the maximum pressure campaign. It ended in total failure as the US isolated itself instead.\n\nAmong other embarrassments, the leaders of Germany, France, and the European Union \u2014 all members in the Iran nuclear deal \u2014 didn\u2019t come, despite Hook\u2019s invitation. Meanwhile, other European and Arab nations sent low-level delegates to the sessions.\n\nThat left top American officials, like Vice President Mike Pence and Pompeo, in an embarrassing position. Usually they would only attend events featuring their counterparts; in this case, they flew all the way to Poland to hobnob with foreign leaders well below their stature.\n\nIt also didn\u2019t help that Pence gave a fiery speech, lecturing the Europeans about giving Iran money, even though the accord they still adhere to allows it. It\u2019s \u201can ill-advised step that will only strengthen Iran, weaken the EU, and create still more distance between Europe and America,\u201d Pence said. Many in the audience were stunned, officials told me.\n\nThat conference and other woes didn\u2019t keep Hook out of the running to replace John Bolton as national security adviser in September. Two people familiar with the situation said that Kushner pushed for Hook to get the job, though he ultimately lost out.\n\nThe admiration inside the administration, however, hasn\u2019t totally translated to Capitol Hill. During an October Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, Hook testified on Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw US troops from Syria, abandoning long-time Kurdish allies and leading to Turkey\u2019s incursion to kill them.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney (R-UT), who Hook supported and advised during the 2012 presidential campaign, asked him if Iran would benefit from a lack of American presence and further chaos in the region. Hook could only respond with a non-answer. \u201cOur military is in Syria for ISIS, our diplomacy is focused on Iran,\u201d he said, noting his work on the \u201cpressure side\u201d dovetails with his colleagues\u2019 efforts to find a diplomatic solution in the country.\n\nRomney was incredulous. \u201cIt\u2019s astonishing that the Administration\u2019s top Iran expert does not believe Turkey\u2019s attacks on Kurds in Syria are a game changer in favor of Iran,\u201d he tweeted about the exchange. \u201cKurds are now aligned with Assad, whose regime is backed by Iran!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s astonishing that the Administration\u2019s top Iran expert does not believe Turkey\u2019s attacks on Kurds in Syria are a game changer in favor of Iran.

Between Tehran\u2019s aggressive pushback and his role in Nowrouzzadeh\u2019s ouster, they worry Democrats will trash him on camera. Others also admit that Hook isn\u2019t that impressive on Iran policy even in private, which makes him expendable as far as they\u2019re concerned.\n\nIndeed, Hook may have climbed to the top of Mount Trump, but it\u2019s come at the cost of getting on the wrong side of his previously like-minded Republicans. If there was ever a moment to crystalize Hook\u2019s journey, it was his dispute with Romney: Seven years earlier, he helped Romney devise an internationalist American foreign policy. Today, he\u2019s an emblem of the Trump administration to the world \u2014 repping a foreign policy that some say is overly brash, overly aggressive, and overly haphazard.\n\nWhether or not he ultimately succeeds with Iran, many will forever peg him as a Trump guy. Only Hook knows whether it\u2019s been worth it, but those who know him understand the situation he\u2019s in.\n\n\u201cThis has been an exceptionally difficult administration in which to serve, especially for people of quality,\u201d Feaver, Hook\u2019s former associate, told me. \u201cJust by surviving as long as he has, Brian has accomplished something.\u201d",
