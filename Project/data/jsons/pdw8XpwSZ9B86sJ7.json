Beyond Meat and its privately held rival Impossible Foods have recently grabbed headlines and fast-food deals for their plant-based burgers that imitate the taste of beef . They 've also turned the environmental benefits of abstaining from meat into a key marketing tool for their products \u2014 drawing some skepticism from environmental researchers who say plant diets are healthier and less carbon emitting than producing processed plant-based products . Animal agriculture is responsible for 14.5 % of global greenhouse emissions , according to the United Nations ' Food and Agriculture Organization , with 65 % of those emissions coming from beef and dairy cattle . Scientists warn that climate change will trigger an international food crisis unless humans change the way they produce meat and use land . While companies producing imitation meat boast of the environmental benefits , some researchers point out that for people wanting to substantially lower their carbon footprint , having unprocessed plant-based diets instead of eating imitation products is healthier and better for the planet .

Beyond primarily works with protein from peas , while Impossible uses genetically modified soy . `` It makes sense to develop alternatives to beef , because we have to change our eating habits to more plant-based diets if we want to limit global warming to under 2 degrees Celsius .
