My feisty , tri-colored Welsh Corgi who never met a Cheez-It he didn \u2019 t like .\nOn more than one occasion , the undersized Hampton somehow wrapped a raggedy blanket around the rods of my Bowflex , managing to lug the entire apparatus from the den into the hall with his jaws \u2013 just to show off how strong he was .\nHampton lived to the ripe age of 16-and-a-half and left us a few years ago . But from time to , Hampton plunged himself into trouble . He tore something up . Devoured the mail ( including a paycheck once ) . I would stare at Hampton and admonish him . I \u2019 d present Hampton with the violated item and inquire if he \u201c did this \u201d or was responsible .\nAnd Hampton would simply look away . Stare off into the distance . Nothing to see here \u2026\nHampton thought if he didn \u2019 t look at me , then well , I wasn \u2019 t there . Like a 5-year-old , Hampton \u2019 s solution was to deny the problem and maybe , prayerfully , it would melt away .\nSuch was the case for months with many congressional Republicans and the possibility that Donald Trump might emerge as the GOP presidential nominee .\nElisabeth Kubler-Ross argued there are five stages of grief in her 1969 book \u201c On Death and Dying . \u201d\nDenial is one . So is isolation . Acceptance is the fifth stage .\nIt \u2019 s almost fashionable now to describe many congressional Republicans as ascending to the acceptance level . Some are concerned it \u2019 s a fait accompli that Trump , a billionaire businessman , will secure the Republican nomination either now or after a potentially-raucous , convention in Cleveland .\nKubler-Ross says some resist the fifth level . But resistance only prolongs the healing process .\nSelf-immolation may consume the Republican Party now . But in politics , there could well be a sixth stage of grief . It \u2019 s far more complex and especially nebulous .\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky. , may have first christened this stage , commonly referred to as the \u201c hot rock \u201d approach .\nMcConnell predicted GOPers would dispose of Trump \u201c like a hot rock \u201d if his combative , coarse rhetoric proved problematic for the GOP to maintain its Senate majority .\nAfter all , Republicans now enjoy a 54-46 edge in the Senate ( two independent senators caucus with the Democrats ) . The 2016 election map doesn \u2019 t do Republicans any favors as the GOP holds many of the most competitive Senate seats this cycle . Therefore , everyone should do whatever enables them to come to grips with this new reality -- and get re-elected .\nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich , R-Ga. , huddled recently with House Republican chiefs of staff at a retreat . Gingrich told the Capitol Hill bosses they need to brace themselves for Trump -- because they weren \u2019 t ready for the reality of his nomination .\nSome rank-and-file members wallowed even deeper into denial -- effectively practicing stage six .\nIn fact , Fox is told there are anywhere from five to 10 House Republicans who may not cast a ballot for president this year if Trump is the party nominee . That number could grow , depending on the nominee . And many Republican lawmakers might not even attend the convention in Cleveland .\nRep. Lou Barletta , R-Pa. , is part of a small contingent of congressional Republicans who openly support Trump .\nTrump \u2019 s team plans the first of multiple sessions with congressional backers on Capitol Hill next week . Barletta thinks some of his colleagues are making a mistake by not supporting Trump .\n\u201c They should be looking at why he \u2019 s so popular , \u201d he said . \u201c The fact that the party isn \u2019 t getting behind him worries me . We could have a divided party . \u201d\nBarletta said his \u201c Facebook now is blowing up \u201d in favor of his decision to get behind Trump .\n\u201c He \u2019 s someone from the outside ( who ) scares people in Washington , \u201d he said .\nRep. Scott DesJarlais , R-Tenn. , echoed Barletta , saying congressional Republicans \u201c need to get used to the idea \u201d of Trump leading the party in November .\nGOP Reps. Chris Collins , N.Y. , and Duncan Hunter Jr. , Calif. , were the first two House members to publicly get behind Trump . They \u2019 re heading outreach efforts to court fellow congressional Republicans .\nRep. Renee Ellmers , R-N.C. is the only female lawmaker behind Trump . That surprises many , considering Trump \u2019 s comments about women .\n\u201c I know he \u2019 s made some off-the-cuff-comments . I certainly don \u2019 t condone them , \u201d Ellmers said . \u201c As a Republican , we need to concentrate on things we agree with . We need to come together in a unified party . \u201d\nIt \u2019 s why some Republicans hope the \u201c Never Trump \u201d movement succeeds . Some are now behind Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz , which is remarkable considering Cruz has made few friends among his Senate colleagues and engineered the 2013 government shutdown .\nCruz called McConnell a liar on the Senate floor last summer .\nBut some Republicans are now in the Cruz camp simply because his surname isn \u2019 t Trump . Some think advocating for Cruz helps split the party , bolstering chances for a contested convention in Cleveland . That could harm Trump and maybe give someone else a shot .\n\u201c It wo n't surprise any of you to know , I \u2019 d like to elect a president and I 'm hoping this process leads to nominating somebody who can win election , \u201d McConnell said .\nAt the behest of the other GOP White House candidate , Ohio Gov . John Kasich , Sen . Rob Portman , R-Ohio , orchestrated a conclave with Republican political operatives on Capitol Hill this past week . Portman said he wasn \u2019 t there to talk about strategy . Just talk about the merits of Kasich .\n\u201c Kasich is the best choice to unify , \u201d Portman said . \u201c He has the best poll numbers against Hillary Clinton , or for that matter , ( Sen. ) Bernie Sanders , \u201d the Vermont Independent .\nAnd then , there is the geosynchronous , potential presidential orbit of House Speaker Paul Ryan , R-Wis. , -- especially at a multi-ballot convention .\nSen. Orrin Hatch , R-Utah , fueled some of the \u201c in-case-of-emergency-break-glass-and-pick-Ryan-as-the nominee \u201d talk this week . He said \u201c speculation \u201d about Ryan was \u201c natural. \u201d .\n\u201c He \u2019 s one of the great leaders here on Capitol Hill and one who brings both sides , all sides , together , \u201d Hatch said .\nRyan and his team are exhausted trying to quash this chatter . Ryan repeatedly said he \u2019 s not running for president and that the nominee should come from the current field of candidates . But multiple observers note that Ryan still hasn \u2019 t uttered a \u201c Sherman-esque \u201d rebuke .\nThere was an effort to draft Civil War General William Tecumseh Sherman to run for president in 1884 . Sherman didn \u2019 t , famously snubbing his suitors by saying , \u201c I will not accept if nominated and will not serve if elected . \u201d\nRyan has outright said no before . He assumed a Sherman-esque posture last fall moments after House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy , R-Calif. , abruptly withdrew from the speaker \u2019 s race .\n\u201c While I am grateful for the encouragement I \u2019 ve received , I will not be a candidate , \u201d Ryan said about the speaker vacancy .\nHowever , a possible white knight scenario lingers for Ryan . And the speaker \u2019 s office certainly stokes these embers with impressive videos like this one :\nThe sophisticated video is a kinetic cut of Ryan \u2019 s March speech to congressional interns in the historic House Ways and Means Committee hearing room .\nThe film only runs 39 seconds . But it entails 24 edits , cinematically hopscotching from frame to frame . Many shots don \u2019 t appear on screen for more than a second . No shot lasts more than three seconds until the camera locks on the speaker as he laments the politics of division .\nThe video speeds up b-roll of interns filing into the room . It starts with tinny , compressed audio of Ryan \u2019 s remarks that then morphs into stereo-quality sound .\nBut it \u2019 s not just how the video is edited . It \u2019 s how the video is shot . It features pans of the audience . The final shot drops down from Ryan and onto a sandwich board affixed to the lectern . It reads \u201c @ SpeakerRyan # ConfidentAmerica . \u201d\nCamera placement captures the most dramatic moment of the entire presentation . Ryan \u2019 s team positioned one camera behind the speaker , high above the Ways and Means dais .\nThat shot reveals Ryan from the back , his arms extended , revealing the enormity of the crowd -- as well as a phalanx of TV cameras and still photographers .\nThe speaker might say he \u2019 s not interested in the nomination .
