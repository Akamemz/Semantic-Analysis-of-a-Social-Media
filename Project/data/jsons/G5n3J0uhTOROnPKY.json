    "content": "The American people face an important choice in November . They will either re-elect President Barack Obama for another four-year term , or they will replace him with Governor Mitt Romney . Rather than recapitulate the case against a second term for the incumbent , let 's scrutinize eight of the top prevailing arguments against electing his Republican challenger . Each of the following anti-Romney indictments has been advanced -- explicitly , or through surrogates -- by the president 's campaign and the Democratic Party . Below you 'll find my sincere attempt to address these criticisms in a balanced and honest way , even as I openly and transparently admit my conservative leanings at the outset . I will attempt to rate each claim as as either true , fair , unfair , or false -- and will aim to offer verification of my facts through embedded links to credible , reliable , and non-partisan sources :\nCriticism # 1 - Mitt Romney seems secretive because he wo n't release more than two years of his personal tax returns . Rating : Fair and mostly true . ( SEE UPDATE ) .\nGovernor Romney is a very wealthy man , with an estimated net worth in excess of $ 200 million . Born poor , Romney 's father worked hard and ultimately became a hugely successful executive in the auto industry . He was later elected governor of Michigan , then fell short in an unsuccessful presidential bid . When George Romney died , he left a large inheritance to his children , including Mitt , who donated his share to charity . Mitt Romney earned his own sizable fortune over a lengthy and `` sterling '' private sector career in finance . Now that he is running for president , critics have questioned why Romney has n't released more than two years of tax returns , citing a precedent set by his father in 1968 . No one disputes that Romney has filed all of the legally-required financial disclosure documents for a presidential run , but he has declined to make any more tax records public . Some conservatives , including yours truly , have urged him to divulge more information . Given the feeding frenzy among his opponents over this issue , it is very unlikely that he will comply at this stage . What we do know is that Romney has n't encountered any trouble from the IRS -- suggesting legal compliance -- and that the McCain campaign Vice Presidential vetters who waded through decades of Romney 's tax documents in 2008 have stated Romney 's taxes are paid in full ( and the former governor may have even slightly overpaid in some instances ) . Romney also asserts he has n't paid a lower income tax rate than 13 percent in the last ten years , but that number can not be confirmed without further documentation . The Romney 's have donated prodigious amounts of money to charity over that period , including to his church , veterans groups , and medical research foundations .\n[ UPDATE 9/21/12 - Romney has now dealt with this issue much more comprehensively . He has complied with tax law , paid nearly double the average American 's effective rate over two decades , and has given very generously to charity . ]\nCriticism # 2 - During his tenure at Bain Capital , Mitt Romney shipped American jobs overseas , was a `` pioneer '' in the practice of outsourcing , and may have committed a felony by lying to the SEC . Rating : False .\nThe Obama campaign has spent tens of millions of dollars on negative advertisements accusing Romney of being an outsourcer of American jobs . Independent fact-checkers have exhaustively dismantled this claim ; FactCheck.org ruled that `` no evidence '' exists to support the charge , and the Washington Post awarded the ads `` Four Pinocchios . '' When the Romney campaign began to push back against the discredited allegations , a top Obama aide suggested that Romney might have committed a felony by lying to the federal government about his departure from Bain Capital . Romney left Bain in 1999 to save the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City . ( When Romney took over , the games were tainted by a bribery scandal and drowning in debt ) . In taking on this challenge , he gave up all active managing duties at the company , even as he remained its titular CEO . The Obama campaign used this leave of absence to muddy the waters about Romney 's Bain timeline , culminating in the `` felony '' line . Fact-checkers again smacked down Team Obama , accusing them of `` blowing smoke , '' without evidence . They determined that Romney left his managing role at Bain in early 1999 -- the same conclusion reached by an independent , taxpayer-funded commission in Massachusetts , which investigated the same question in 2002 when Romney was running for governor .\nCriticism # 3 - Mitt Romney seeks to ban contraception , and opposes all abortion , even in the cases of rape and incest . Rating : False .\nDuring the uproar over the Obama administration 's unprecedented birth control mandate , some Democrats suggested that Republicans were intent on `` banning '' birth control . In fact , Republicans sought to prevent religious organizations and employers from being forced to pay for other people 's contraception , in violation of their First Amendment right to freedom of religion . Conservatives simultaneously argued that contraceptives have been widely available and affordable for decades , and should remain that way . At a Republican primary debate ( prior to the mandate ) , Romney put it succinctly : Contraception is `` working just fine . Just leave it alone . '' On abortion , Romney and his running mate are both pro-life , as is a narrow majority of Americans . Romney does , however , make exceptions for the rare cases of rape and incest , and if the mother 's life is at risk . A campaign ad from Barack Obama states that Romney does not make these exceptions . Politifact , a left-leaning fact-checker , has tagged this commercial with a `` pants on fire '' score for its dishonesty . The spot is still running in swing states . A Buzzfeed article making similar false claims about Paul Ryan 's views has also been corrected .\nCriticism # 4 - Mitt Romney evaded paying taxes for a decade , and was party to the `` largest tax avoidance scheme in history . '' Rating : False .\nThe first allegation was leveled by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , a Democrat of Nevada . Reid initially peddled the rumor to reporters , then repeated it on the floor of the Senate . He offered no proof , nor any indication of who his alleged `` source '' might be . Given Romney 's good standing with the IRS and Reid 's refusal to substantiate his assertions , fact-checkers firmly rejected them . `` Four Pinocchios , '' declared the Washington Post . `` Pants on fire , '' determined left-leaning Politifact . Several Romney defenders have also noted that Reid himself steadfastly refuses to hand over his own tax returns , despite being the most powerful man in the Senate . He also voted to confirm Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner , in spite of his documented tax problems . On the `` tax avoidance scheme '' question -- raised in an Obama campaign ad -- FactCheck.org dug through the case and rendered this verdict on the Obama campaign 's charge : `` There is so much deceit here , we do n't even know where to start . ''\nCriticism # 5 - Mitt Romney 's tax plan would cut rates for the wealthy , but raise taxes on middle class families by over $ 2,000 . Rating : Unfair , despite some fair criticisms .\nPointing to a nominally non-partisan study from the Tax Policy Center , President Obama says Mitt Romney 's tax reforms are regressive . He argues they would either hit middle income Americans with higher taxes , or add to deficits . The TPC paper declares Romney 's plan `` mathematically impossible '' without crossing into at least one of these undesirable outcomes . In fact , the study admits that it does not directly score Romney 's plan because his proposals lack certain important specifics . This is a fair criticism . To compensate for this missing data , the researchers plugged in assumptions of their own ( sometimes ignoring Romney 's plainly stated positions ) , and failed to factor in other countervailing elements of Romney 's agenda . This is not fair . The American Enterprise Institute and the Wall Street Journal have described scenarios under which Romney 's plan is entirely feasible , based on the arithmetic and evidence from recent political history . Romney 's plan itself involves lowering tax rates among all income brackets by 20 percent , as well as bringing down the corporate tax rate ( the highest in the industrialized world ) . He would `` pay for '' these cuts by limiting and eliminating loopholes and deductions , particularly for higher income earners . These details have not yet been made clear -- a glaring weakness . In principle , this approach would broaden the tax base , simplify the tax code , and lower overall rates . It is a model akin to the recommendations made by the president 's fiscal commission , which Obama has chosen to ignore . President Obama has already raised taxes on lower and middle income Americans on several occasions , particularly with the 'Obamacare ' mandate tax .\nCriticism # 6 - Mitt Romney 's closure of a steel plant in Kansas City led to the death of a woman with cancer . Rating : False .\nThis charge is the most incendiary we 've seen in the current campaign cycle , bordering on outright slander . President Obama 's campaign introduced this line attack on a conference call with the press , and on its official website . The president 's formally-endorsed SuperPAC -- run by a former White House spokesman -- picked up on the charge , enshrining it in a very controversial ad . It was roundly pummeled by independent fact-checkers and media organizations . In short , the star of the ad ( steelworker Joe Soptic ) was laid off in 2001 , eight years after Mitt Romney 's Bain Capital invested in his faltering factory in a bid to save the business , and two years after Romney left Bain . Soptic was laid off by Bain 's new management , including a man named Jonathan Lavine , who is now a major Obama donor . Five years after the plant closure , in 2006 , Soptic 's wife was diagnosed with cancer and died shortly thereafter . It was later revealed that Mrs. Soptic had retained her own insurance after her husband had been laid off . Her coverage dropped when she eventually left her job , prior to being diagnosed . The insinuation that Romney had anything to do with her death is egregiously misleading and low . `` Outrageous , '' fumed CNN . `` Four Pinocchios , '' groaned the Washington Post . `` A disgrace , '' concluded Obama 's hometown newspaper , the Chicago Tribune . Obama 's SuperPAC has stood by the ad , spending millions to put it on the air in swing states . The Obama campaign and White House have refused to condemn it , eventually getting tangled up and caught in a clear lie about their knowledge of the Soptic family 's story . Time 's Mark Halperin branded the entire episode the lowest moment of the 2012 campaign in a heated MSNBC appearance .\nCriticism # 7 - Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan 's Medicare plan `` kills Medicare . '' Rating : False .\nAn email blast from a Democratic campaign committee resurrected this claim , which was ranked by left-leaning Politifact as the 2011 political `` lie of the year . '' Other Democrats have hedged slightly , modifying their accusation to say Romney and Ryan would `` end Medicare as we know it . '' The DNC Chairwoman has described the plan as a `` death trap '' for seniors , and a `` tornado '' tearing through nursing homes . This is hysteria , and bears no relation to reality . For the full facts on the dueling Medicare reform visions , read this piece . The basics : According to its own actuaries , Medicare is slated to become insolvent within 12 years . This would result in major cuts for current seniors , and the implosion of the program for future generations ( who are still paying into it , under penalty of law ) . In other words , basic math will `` end Medicare as we know it '' soon , absent reform . Everyone acknowledges this hard reality , including the president . The Romney-Ryan solution is modeled on a bipartisan proposal co-authored by Paul Ryan and liberal Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon . The plan grandfathers in all citizens 55 years old or older , guaranteeing no changes from current policy . For younger Americans , Medicare benefits would be paid out under a federal premium support program , as future seniors would choose among a menu of options . One of these options would remain the traditional fee-for-service Medicare model . The others would be private plans , competing for seniors ' business . The Obama plan is quite different . The president transferred $ 700 Billion in Medicare cuts in order to partially fund his new Affordable Care Act , or `` Obamacare . '' This maneuver is resulting in real cuts to current seniors . According to the federal Medicare accountants , it strips four million seniors out of the popular `` Medicare Advantage '' program , and cuts government reimbursements to care-givers and hospitals . Medicare 's chief actuary estimated this could result in the closure of 1 in 6 hospitals that treat seniors . As for the future , long-term solvency of the program for future generations , the president has not proposed anything that even approaches the level of a meaningful plan .\nCriticism # 8 - The Romney team is running a `` dirty '' and dishonorable campaign . Rating : Fair or unfair ( comparative `` dirtiness '' is in the eye of the beholder ) .\nIn light of many of the facts outlined above , it may seem astounding that the Obama campaign would cast themselves as the victims of a nasty campaign . Nevertheless , in pushing back against strong condemnation of the 'cancer ' ad , numerous Obama aides cited a Romney commercial on welfare reform as a counter-balancing example . In essence they 've argued , how can you heap opprobrium on us over a spot run by a SuperPAC we ca n't control ( never mind that they introduced the cancer attack ) , when the Romney campaign itself is running these welfare ads ? The spot in question focuses on a quiet executive action taken by the Obama administration 's Department of Health and Human Services in early July . The decision ignored explicit language in the 1996 Clinton-era welfare reform act by opening up the law 's federal work requirements to state-by-state waivers . This move allows states to alter or water-down the black-and-white , non-negotiable standards set forth in the statute . The meaning of the legislative language has been confirmed by the non-partisan Congressional Research Service . Romney 's ads pushed too far by drawing a direct line between Obama and potential state decisions based on the newly increased leeway . The Republican spots labeled the possible hollowing out of work requirements at the state level `` Obama 's plan . '' This is an exaggeration , but the larger issue is rooted in fact . Politifact awarded the Romney campaign a `` pants on fire '' rating for the ad , even though they accepted one of Romney 's central arguments , and chose not to address the core question of whether the administration 's action was lawful . ABC News ' fact-check was more even handed , scolding Romney for exaggerations , but acknowledging that his concerns may soon be proven justified . In any case , the Obama campaign seems to believe that this welfare ad is on par with the comprehensively debunked and sleazy 'cancer ' spot , roughly evening out to a `` tie '' of sorts . I suppose this comes down to a judgment call . It may also be useful to look at the sheer dollar amounts spent on negative advertising , the percentage of ads that are negative , and illustrative events such as Vice President Biden 's recent racially-charged `` chains '' remark .\nConclusion : As the election approaches , it is relatively apparent that President Obama will continue to hew to his campaign 's early strategy to ( figuratively ) `` kill Romney . '' His approval ratings on the biggest issues of the day -- jobs , the economy and deficits -- are upside-down , and sinking . His most well-known policies are unpopular and have failed to live up to the promises upon which they were built . Therefore , his best -- perhaps only -- path to victory entails disqualifying his opponent in the eyes of voters . His party 's attacks and negative ads against Romney have primarily , though not entirely , focused on the themes and allegations addressed in this column . I think it 's striking how many of these criticisms have been deemed to be outright falsehoods by independent news organizations and fact-checkers . Several more are at least patently unfair , even with a few genuine criticisms sprinkled in .\nQuestions : I 'll leave you with two thoughts to consider : First , what does it say about the incumbent 's job performance that his campaign is so heavily reliant on discussing subjects other than his track record in office ? Second , what does it say about the president 's challenger that so many of the high-profile attacks against him have been grossly distorted , or entirely fabricated ?",
