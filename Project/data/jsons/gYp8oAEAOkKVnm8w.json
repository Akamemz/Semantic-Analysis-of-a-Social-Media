    "content": "The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday approved a renewed assault-weapons ban , advancing the measure to the Senate floor where it will face intense resistance from Republicans and other gun-rights supporters .\nThe bill was approved by the committee on a party-line , 10-8 vote . Chief sponsor , Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D-Calif. , said she knows `` the road is uphill '' for the legislation , but sought to press her colleagues to consider the bill .\n`` Are we going to stand with the thousands of police chiefs and law enforcement officers who do support this bill ? Are we going to stand with the victims of gun violence ? '' she said , stressing that the bill does not take `` any weapons away from anybody '' but would ban future purchases .\nRepublicans , though , described the legislation -- which comes nearly a decade after the last assault-weapons ban expired -- as an ineffective response to a genuine problem .\nSen. Lindsey Graham , R-S.C. , noted that so-called assault weapons are used in a scant percentage of murders every year and said a ban would merely provide a `` false sense of safety . '' He critiqued another measure that would limit the size of magazines .\n`` I could see a situation where an individual citizen would need more than six bullets , or 10 '' for self-defense , he said . `` There are so many better ways to deal with this . ''\nThe vote comes after the Senate Judiciary Committee advanced bills earlier in the week to enact near-universal background checks and combat gun trafficking . The measure approved Thursday is the most controversial drafted since the deadly Newtown , Conn. , school shooting .\nBut once it reaches the full Senate -- probably in April -- the measure faces heavy opposition by Republicans and some moderate Democrats , as well . Feinstein acknowledged she 'd need more backing if it is to stand a chance on the floor -- even then , it 's hard to imagine a circumstance where the Republican-controlled House would allow the measure to proceed .\n`` I 'd like to see everybody doing more , '' bill sponsor Feinstein said Wednesday when asked if she 'd like more assistance from President Obama . `` Yes , absolutely , we need help . We have the 800-pound gorilla out there '' -- a reference to the potent National Rifle Association .\nObama made an assault weapons ban part of the gun curbs he proposed in January , a month after a shooter with an assault rifle killed 20 first-graders and six educators at a school in Newtown , Conn. Feinstein and others have argued that such firearms are used in a disproportionate number of mass shootings and should n't be available to civilians .\nThe prohibition has emerged as one of the most controversial of the gun restrictions being considered in Congress . Foes of barring the weapons say law-abiding citizens should not lose their Second Amendment right to own the weapons , which they say are popular for self-defense , hunting and collecting .\nFeinstein 's bill would also ban large-capacity ammunition magazines carrying more than 10 rounds , which she and her allies say allow shooters to inflict more casualties before pausing to reload , which is when they might be stopped . Adam Lanza , the Newtown gunman , was said to have had 30-round magazines .\nThe measure 's passage by the Judiciary panel has been a foregone conclusion for some time . It will be far more vulnerable in the full Senate , where Democrats are expected to need 60 votes for passage through the 100-member chamber . That is where the NRA and other pro-gun groups are working hard for the ban 's defeat .\n`` We are focused on the next step of the legislative process , '' Chris W. Cox , the NRA 's chief lobbyist , said Wednesday .\nThere are 53 Democrats plus two independents who generally side with them . Republicans seem ready to oppose the ban overwhelmingly , and Feinstein ca n't count on a half-dozen Democrats from Republican-leaning states who face re-election next year .\nThe ban also stands little chance of approval in the GOP-controlled House .\nFeinstein 's bill would ban semi-automatic weapons -- guns that fire one round and automatically reload -- that can take a detachable magazine and have at least one military feature like a pistol grip .\nIt specifically bans 157 named weapons . But in an effort to avoid antagonizing those who use them for sports , the measure allows 2,258 rifles and shotguns that are frequently used by hunters .\nIt also exempts any weapons that are lawfully owned whenever the bill is enacted .\nFeinstein was a leader in passage of a 1994 ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines . Congress failed to renew it when it expired in 2004 .\nThere are no definitive figures on assault weapons or high-capacity ammunition magazines in the U.S. , since there are no government registries of firearms and Congress has curbed federal research on guns since the late 1990s .\nWhen the previous assault weapons ban took effect in 1994 , there were an estimated 1.5 million assault weapons and at least 25 million large-capacity magazines that were privately owned in the U.S .\nProponents of banning the weapons cite studies showing that once the assault weapons ban took hold , the portion of gun crimes using those firearms dropped by up to 72 percent in six cities surveyed .
