    "content": "This is a rush transcript . Copy may not be in its final form .\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : A leading arms control organization is calling for President Obama to take U.S. nuclear missiles off high alert before President-elect Donald Trump assumes office . The Ploughshares Fund has circulated a public petition urging President Obama to place restraints on the incoming president \u2019 s ability to launch a nuclear attack .\nLast week , President-elect Trump alarmed nuclear weapons experts when he raised the prospect of a new global arms race on Twitter , saying he would increase the size of the U.S. nuclear arsenal . Trump \u2019 s tweet read , quote , \u201c The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes , \u201d end-quote . The United States and Russia account for 93 percent of the world \u2019 s nuclear arsenal . Following Trump \u2019 s tweet , his spokesman , Sean Spicer , tried to clarify Trump \u2019 s position in an interview with CNN . He was speaking to Alisyn Camerota .\nSEAN SPICER : He is going to do what it takes to protect this country . And if another country or countries want to threaten our safety or sovereignty , he \u2019 s going to do what it takes .\nALISYN CAMEROTA : Sure , but he \u2019 s not waiting until another country threatens us . He \u2019 s making these proclamations before it .\nSEAN SPICER : He \u2019 s making it very clear\u2014no , right , but he \u2019 s making it very clear that other countries and other companies\u2014you \u2019 ve seen with Carrier and other\u2014he \u2019 s going to make it clear that he will be an active president that will get things done .\nALISYN CAMEROTA : Meaning he will use nuclear weapons if need be .\nSEAN SPICER : No , no . He will\u2014he will not take anything off the table .\nAMY GOODMAN : So that \u2019 s Trump spokesperson Sean Spicer , speaking last week on CNN with Alisyn Camerota .\nWell , to talk more about Trump \u2019 s comments , we go to Washington , D.C. , to speak with Joe Cirincione , president of the Ploughshares Fund , which has circulated the petition urging President Obama to take U.S. nuclear missiles off high alert .\nAMY GOODMAN : What do you mean that President Obama , before he leaves office , should take nuclear weapons off high alert ? What does this mean ? And can Trump reverse this immediately on the first day ?\nJOSEPH CIRINCIONE : Well , Donald Trump is a policy chameleon . With the exception of a few issues , you don \u2019 t really know what he thinks . So when he tweets out that he wants to expand U.S. nuclear capability , when he tells a network correspondent that \u201c Let it be an arms race , \u201d you have to worry that he means what he says . You have to worry that a man of this temperament , of this character , might be more willing to use nuclear weapons than any previous president .\nSo there is something that President Obama can do about this to buy us some time . He can end the Cold War practice of keeping our nuclear missiles on high alert , ready to launch in a few minutes \u2019 notice . This is something that he pledged to do when he was campaigning , said he would do it when he took office , never did it . He \u2019 s got 22 days to try and correct that mistake .\nYes , President Trump could then come in and reverse it , but that is much harder to do . It would be very difficult for President Trump to put nuclear missiles on high alert . Why are you doing that ? What \u2019 s the crisis ? What \u2019 s the justification ? This is one of those policies that has survived because people haven \u2019 t looked at it , people haven \u2019 t questioned it . Why does anyone have the ability to launch nuclear weapons so quickly ? In 22 days , Donald Trump will be able to launch nuclear missiles as quickly as he now tweets . Four minutes after he gives the order , those missiles will fly . No one can stop him . No one can reverse those launches .\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Well , I \u2019 d like to go back to comments Trump made earlier this year on the risk of nuclear proliferation . During a Republican presidential town hall in Milwaukee , Trump talked about the possibility of other countries acquiring nuclear weapons . He was questioned by moderator , CNN \u2019 s Anderson Cooper .\nDONALD TRUMP : At some point , we have to say , \u201c You know what ? We \u2019 re better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea . We \u2019 re better off , frankly , if South Korea is going to start to protect itself. \u201d We have to\u2014\nANDERSON COOPER : You would be fine with them having nuclear weapons ?\nDONALD TRUMP : \u2014but they have to protect themselves , or they have to pay us . Here \u2019 s the thing : With Japan , they have to pay us , or we have to let them protect themselves .\nANDERSON COOPER : So , but if you say to Japan , \u201c Yes , it \u2019 s fine you get nuclear weapons , \u201d South Korea , \u201c You , as well , \u201d and Saudi Arabia says , \u201c We want them , too \u201d \u2014\nDONALD TRUMP : It \u2019 s going to\u2014can I be honest with you ? It \u2019 s going to happen anyway . It \u2019 s going to happen anyway . It \u2019 s only a question of time .\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : That was President-elect Trump speaking earlier this year . So , Joe Cirincione , can you respond to that , not only the question of high alert , taking the U.S. nuclear missiles off high alert , but also Trump \u2019 s position on other countries acquiring nuclear weapons ?\nJOSEPH CIRINCIONE : Yeah . He \u2019 s wrong on so many levels here . Let \u2019 s take it apart . First of all , it is not inevitable . There is nothing inevitable about nuclear proliferation . For the last 40 years , Democrats and Republicans , liberals and conservatives , have had a concerted policy to reduce nuclear weapons in the world . And guess what . It has worked . There are far fewer nuclear weapons in the world now than at the height of the Cold War . We \u2019 ve cut the global arsenals by 80 percent . More countries have given up nuclear weapons and nuclear programs over the last 30 years than have tried to acquire them . We \u2019 re down to one rogue state , so-called rogue state , North Korea . That \u2019 s it . There \u2019 s nobody else . So there \u2019 s nothing inevitable about this .\nNumber two , the idea that he would encourage other countries to get nuclear weapons flies in the face of 70 years of U.S. policy . No U.S. president has ever encouraged any country to get a nuclear weapon\u2014not the United Kingdom , not France , not Israel\u2014our allies . We didn \u2019 t want them to get nuclear weapons . Japan , South Korea , Saudi Arabia\u2014that is insane . That is starting an arms race . Can you start an arms race with a tweet ? Can you start an arms race with this unclear , rambling kind of discourse he has ? Yes , you can . President Trump will be able to do this with the stroke of a pen , with a side comment , with another tweet . That \u2019 s what worries so many people about his getting control of the most capable , the most destructive death machine on the planet\u2014the U.S. nuclear arsenal .\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Well , the U.S. and Russia , between them , have 93 percent of the world \u2019 s nuclear arsenal . So , if he does accelerate the arms race , what are the prospects for other nuclear weapon states\u2014China , India , Pakistan\u2014who , in relative terms , have virtually none ?\nJOSEPH CIRINCIONE : Yes . When you do bar graphs , you know , you see the U.S. column go way high , Russia \u2019 s column go way high . The other countries , with 100 or so nuclear weapons , barely register . But when the big guys start talking about building new weapons\u2014and the U.S. is already on a path to spend $ 1 trillion on new nuclear weapons over the next 25 years\u2014and then expand those arsenals , they \u2019 re basically telling the other countries , \u201c Start your engines. \u201d What is China going to do ? They have about 200 nuclear weapons now . Won \u2019 t they feel pressure to expand ? And then India and Pakistan ? You can see the nuclear chain reaction this kind of thing sets off . That \u2019 s why reversing this three-decades-long U.S. policy of reducing nuclear weapons is so dangerous . You shouldn \u2019 t be making nuclear policy on Twitter . It is just not a responsible way for any president , for any individual , to behave .\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to turn to comments President Obama made when he was the Democratic presidential nominee in September 2008 . The Arms Control Association asked him about his nuclear policy . Among other issues , Obama addressed specifically the risks involved with the U.S. being able to so swiftly launch a nuclear attack . He responded , quote , \u201c Keeping nuclear weapons ready to launch on a moment \u2019 s notice is a dangerous relic of the Cold War . Such policies increase the risk of catastrophic accidents or miscalculation . I believe that we must address this dangerous situation\u2014something that President Bush promised to do when he campaigned for president back in 2000 , but did not do once in office. \u201d That is what the candidate Obama said . Did President Obama do this ? And what do you think should happen right now ?\nJOSEPH CIRINCIONE : He did not , but he still has time . He \u2019 s been making significant policy changes up until this morning , either statements on , for example , Israel or executive actions to cut\u2014put Arctic drilling sites off-limits for new exploration . He can do this . If he \u2019 s protecting part of the environment , take a step to protect the entire planet . That \u2019 s why we put this petition up on Change.org to\u2014as one small step . People can go there , sign it , build public pressure . We \u2019 re privately trying to communicate to the administration to take this step .\nAnd this is because this relic of the Cold War is so totally unnecessary . There is no reason for the president of the United States to be able to push or to give an order\u2014there isn \u2019 t actually a button\u2014to be able to give an order , and , four minutes later , the nuclear weapons will fly . This was done when we were afraid of a bolt-out-of-the-blue attack from the Soviet Union , hundreds of warheads streaking over the poles\u2014an extremely unlikely scenario . And so there \u2019 s no reason to have this policy now . Even if that were to happen , we have our submarines , we have bombers , that are safe , that could retaliate . So you don \u2019 t need this for any reason . And having this kind of policy greatly exacerbates the risk of an accident . My friend and colleague Eric Schlosser has a brilliant essay in The New Yorker this week about all the accidents we had\u2014have had , how so often we came very , very close to accidentally launching our missiles because of a computer glitch , a misunderstanding , a misreading . There \u2019 s no reason to put the world in this kind of peril .\nAMY GOODMAN : Joe Cirincione , we want to thank you for being with us , president of the Ploughshares Fund , global security foundation , author of Nuclear Nightmares : Securing the World Before It is Too Late and Bomb Scare : The History and Future of Nuclear Weapons . We \u2019 ll link to your Huffington Post piece , \u201c Keep Donald Trump \u2019 s Finger Off the Nuclear Button . \u201d\nThis is \u2588\u2588\u2588 ! , democracynow.org . When we come back , a Cold War story and a request for a pardon of outgoing President Obama . We \u2019 ll talk about the Rosenbergs . Stay with us .",
