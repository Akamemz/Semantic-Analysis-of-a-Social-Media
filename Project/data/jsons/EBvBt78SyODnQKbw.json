    "content": "Two top Democratic strategists have exited the presidential campaign after explosive undercover videos showed them discussing voter fraud and their roles in planting paid agitators at campaign events for Republican candidate Donald Trump .\nRobert Creamer , founder of Democracy Advocates and the husband of Rep. Janice D. Schakowsky , Illinois Democrat , stepped down from the campaign Tuesday , a day after Scott Foval was fired from his post as national field director of Americans United for Change .\nMr. Trump , who has long complained of a \u201c rigged \u201d election system , said at a Tuesday rally in Colorado that the video released by the conservative group Project Veritas Action confirmed his suspicions of Democrat-sponsored political chicanery .\n\u201c The protesters are paid a lot of money by the [ Democratic National Committee ] , and they kept saying , \u2018 I wonder why those people are here , because they never seem to have much on their mind other than stand up and protest , \u2019 \u201d Mr. Trump told a crowd in Colorado Springs . \u201c And yesterday it came out , but it was barely covered by the media . But it \u2019 s all over the internet . They were busted . \u201d\nBrad Woodhouse , Americans United for Change president , said in a late-Monday statement that Mr. Foval \u201c is no longer associated with Americans United for Change . \u201d\nHe insisted that the Democratic political consulting firm has \u201c always operated according to the highest ethical and legal standards . \u201d\nMr. Creamer , a four-decade Democratic strategist who pleaded guilty in 2005 to charges of bank fraud and tax violations , said in a statement that he was \u201c unwilling to become a distraction to the important task of electing Hillary Clinton . \u201d\n\u201c We regret the unprofessional and careless hypothetical conversations that were captured on hidden cameras of a temporary regional contractor for our firm , and he is no longer with us , \u201d said Mr. Creamer , who is also featured in the videos .\nThe two 16-minute videos were released Monday and Tuesday after a yearlong undercover investigation headed by Project Veritas \u2019 James O \u2019 Keefe , known for his hidden-camera probes into Planned Parenthood , ACORN and voter fraud .\nMr. O \u2019 Keefe said the investigation reveals \u201c compelling evidence of a dark-money conspiracy \u201d and that he would continue to release videos as part of a series titled \u201c Rigging the Election \u201d until voters go to the polls on Nov. 8 .\nThe first video shows Democratic strategists discussing how they hire agitators \u2014 including union members , homeless people and the mentally ill \u2014 to incite violence by provoking Trump supporters on camera at campaign stops .\nProject Veritas released a second video Tuesday showing Mr. Foval brainstorming over ways to commit voter fraud , such as by busing people from one state to another , while appearing to indicate that it had already been done in Iowa .\n\u201c It \u2019 s a pretty easy thing for Republicans to say , \u2018 Well , they \u2019 re busing people in , \u2019 \u201d Mr. Foval said . \u201c Well , you know what ? We \u2019 ve been busing people in to deal with you f\u2013ing assholes for 50 years , and we \u2019 re not going to stop now . We \u2019 re just going to find a different way to do it . So , I mean I grew up with that idea . They used to bus people out to Iowa . If they needed people , there we \u2019 d bus people out to Iowa . \u201d\nThe same video shows Mr. Creamer discussing a proposal by a Project Veritas investigator to register people to vote illegally by setting up a shell corporation .\n\u201c I \u2019 m going to write down these options , \u201d Mr. Creamer said . \u201c Let me see if I can chat with the people who are most involved in Hispanic voter registration . \u201d\nMr. Foval , who has worked for the George Soros-funded People for the American Way , said his paid agitators fueled a Chicago protest in March that forced the Trump campaign to cancel its event .\n\u201c They \u2019 re starting confrontations in the line , right ? \u201d said Mr. Foval . \u201c They \u2019 re not starting confrontations in the rally . Because once they \u2019 re inside the rally , they \u2019 re under Secret Service \u2019 s control . When they \u2019 re outside the rally , the media will cover it no matter where it happens . The key is initiating the conflict by having leading conversations with people who are naturally psychotic . \u201d\n\u201c I mean , honestly , it \u2019 s not hard to get some of these assholes to pop off , \u201d Mr. Foval said . \u201c It \u2019 s a matter of showing up , to want to get into the rally , in a Planned Parenthood T-shirt . Or , \u2018 Trump is a Nazi , \u2019 you know . You can message to draw them out and draw them to punch you . \u201d\nAnother operative , Aaron Black , who identified himself as \u201c deputy rapid response director for the DNC for all things Trump on the ground , \u201d said he was with Mr. Creamer \u2019 s group Democracy Partners but that his work was supposed to be a secret .\n\u201c Nobody \u2019 s really supposed to know about me , \u201d Mr. Black said . \u201c So the Chicago protest , when they shut all that , that was us . It was more [ Mr. Creamer ] than me , but none of this is supposed to come back to us because we want it coming from people . We don \u2019 t want it to come from the party . \u201d\nHe said the idea is for the protests to appear spontaneous , not orchestrated by the DNC .\n\u201c So if we do a protest and if it \u2019 s branded a DNC protest , right away the press is going to say , \u2018 partisan , \u2019 \u201d said Mr. Black , also known as \u201c Aaron Minter , \u201d according to the video .\n\u201c But if I \u2019 m in there coordinating with all the groups on the ground and sort of playing field general but they are the ones talking to the cameras , then it \u2019 s actually people , but if we send out press advisories with DNC on them and Clinton campaign , it just doesn \u2019 t have the same effect , \u201d he said .\nThe same day the video was released , Mr. Black posted a photo on Twitter showing protesters outside Trump Tower holding signs with messages such as , \u201c Trump Demeans Women . \u201d\nKeeping the protesters \u2019 connection to the DNC hidden from the press was a priority , Mr. Foval said .\n\u201c We have to be really careful because what we don \u2019 t need is for it to show up on CNN that the DNC paid for X people to \u2014 that \u2019 s not going to happen , \u201d he said .\nMr. O \u2019 Keefe said the first video raises questions about whether the Clinton campaign is coordinating with super PACs and independent expenditure committees in violation of campaign finance rules .\nThe Clinton campaign , DNC , Americans United for Change and Democracy Partners did not return requests for comment Tuesday .\nThe only public criticism of the videos has come from foes of Mr. O \u2019 Keefe \u2019 s past work such as Salon \u2019 s Brendan Gauthier , who said Project Veritas has been criticized for \u201c strategically editing footage to make false accusations . \u201d\nIn the video , Mr. Foval made clear his connections to the DNC and the Clinton campaign .\n\u201c We are contracted directly with the DNC and the campaign both . I am contracted to [ Mr. Creamer ] . But I answer to the head of special events for the DNC and the head of special events and political for the campaign , \u201d said Mr. Foval .\nHe goes on to say , \u201c The campaign pays DNC , DNC pays Democracy Partners , Democracy Partners pays the Foval Group , the Foval Group goes and executes the sh\u2014 on the ground . \u201d\nMr. Creamer indicated that he was in close contact with the Clinton campaign , saying , \u201c We have a call with the campaign every day to go over the focuses that need to be undertaken . \u201d\n\u201c Wherever Trump and Pence are going to be , we have events , \u201d Mr. Creamer said . \u201c And we have a whole team across the country that does that . Both consultants and people from the Democratic Party and the Democratic Party apparatus and people from the campaign , the Clinton campaign . And my role in the campaign is to manage all that . \u201d\nAnother activist , Zulema Rodriguez , told the Project Veritas investigators , \u201c I just had a call today with the campaign and the DNC .
