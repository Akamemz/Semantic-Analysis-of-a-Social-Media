And , as I predicted here in \u2588\u2588\u2588 , it definitely leaned to one side of the aisle . In fact , if you were a conservative Republican , Thursday morning in the Congress was not your finest moment , as Pope Francis laid bare all the ways that the Republican agenda counters Catholic social teaching , from its harsh treatment of immigrants to its fossil fuel-burning disdain for the natural world .\nAnd Francis \u2019 call for politicians to work for the common good was an implicit rebuke to the do-nothing , obstructionist GOP agenda that \u2019 s in service to their corporatist , Chamber of Commerce overlords . \u201c Your own responsibility as members of Congress is to enable this country , by your legislative activity , to grow as a nation . \u2026You are called to defend and preserve the dignity of your fellow citizens in the tireless and demanding pursuit of the common good , for this is the chief aim of all politics , \u201d he said .\nHere are the five key moments in Francis \u2019 speech that made conservatives squirm more than any others :\nThe shout-out to Dorothy Day . Francis commended four Americans in particular , whom he held up as examples of pursuing the common good : Abraham Lincoln , for his pursuit of liberty ; Martin Luther King Jr. , for his commitment to nonviolence and pluralism ; Trappist monk Thomas Merton , for his commitment to dialogue and peace ; and Dorothy Day , for her \u201c social activism , her passion for justice and for the cause of the oppressed . \u201d\nNone of them are exactly conservative , but Day in particular is noted as a radical social activist . She founded the Catholic Worker Movement , which took root during the Great Depression , and urged Catholics to form small , autonomous communities to lead simple lives devoted to the gospel and serving the poor . In addition to being a socialist , Day was outspoken in her support of pacifism and labor rights . \u201c I think it was extraordinary that he cited her as one of the most important people in recent American history . This would be one of the very , very few times that somebody as radical as Dorothy Day was mentioned , '' Sen. Bernie Sander told the Washington Post .\nThe abortion switcheroo . In defiance of the specific guidance not to try to score political points by clapping at partisan applause lines in Francis \u2019 speech , congressional conservatives leapt to their feet the moment Francis delivered the Vatican \u2019 s standard coded language about abortion , mentioning \u201c our responsibility to protect and defend human life at every stage of its development. \u201d Imagine their shock when he immediately followed that with , \u201c This conviction had led me , from the beginning of my ministry , to advocate at different levels for the global abolition of the death penalty. \u201d Psych .\nCatholic social teaching has long put opposition to the death penalty on the same plane as opposition to abortion , most famously with Chicago Archbishop Joseph Bernardin \u2019 s \u201c seamless garment \u201d doctrine , which held sway in the mid-1980s as progressive bishops reminded Catholics that opposition to the death penalty and nuclear war was just as important as abortion\nCalling arms deals \u201c money drenched in blood. \u201d Speaking of death , what about all those arms deals the Republicans are so fond of ? Francis wanted to know who is selling the bad guys all these weapons and why : \u201c Why are deadly weapons being sold to those who plan to inflict untold suffering on individuals and society ? \u201d The answer , according to the pontiff , is \u201c money : money that is drenched in blood , often innocent blood . In the face of this shameful and culpable silence , it is our duty to confront the problem and to stop the arms trade. \u201d I \u2019 m sure the GOP and all the defense contractors who give them money will get right on that .\nReminding the GOP we \u2019 re all foreigners .
