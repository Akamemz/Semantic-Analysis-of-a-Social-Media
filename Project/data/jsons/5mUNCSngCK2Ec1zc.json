Those two groups make up 55 percent of respondents , while people who said abortion should be legal in all and most circumstances amount to 42 percent . These numbers are actually an improvement for the pro-life side from a June 2013 Huffington Post poll that painted a similar picture : 47 percent of respondents said abortion should either always be illegal or generally illegal , except in certain circumstances and 42 percent said abortion should always be legal or generally legal with some restrictions .\nAmericans are misidentifying themselves when it comes to the matter of abortion since a majority clearly support significant restrictions on abortion . That same Huffington Post poll found that 59 percent of Americans either strongly or somewhat favor a ban on abortions after 20 weeks . Other polls yield similar results .\nStudents for Life of America hosted a national display this past semester that polled students on when human rights should begin . Students placed a Post-It Note to indicate what they thought on a board with pictures of preborn children from conception all the way through the ninth month of pregnancy .

It \u2019 s undeniable . Our organization has grown by leaps and bounds since our inception nine years ago , when we had less than 200 pro-life groups nationally . We now have almost 900 .
