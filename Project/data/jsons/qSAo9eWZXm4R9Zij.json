MGM Resorts owns Mandalay Bay .\nThe suit , which was filed in court last Friday , claims that suits against MGM relating to the massacre `` must be dismissed '' because MGM has `` no liability of any kind to defendants , '' the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported . The newspaper explained :\nThe company cites a 2002 federal act that extends liability protection to any company that uses \u201c anti-terrorism \u201d technology or services that can \u201c help prevent and respond to mass violence. \u201d In this case , the company argues , the security vendor MGM hired for Route 91 , Contemporary Services Corp. , was protected from liability because its services had been certified by the Department of Homeland Security for \u201c protecting against and responding to acts of mass injury and destruction . \u201d\nBecause MGM hired the security company for the Route 91 country music festival , the protection extends to MGM , the lawsuit argues .\nMGM does not seek damages against the massacre victims .
