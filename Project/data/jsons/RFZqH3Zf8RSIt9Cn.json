It was presented to the bloc \u2019 s expert group on media literacy and has been shared among member states .\nThe exercises include examining claims found in YouTube videos and social media posts , comparing media bias in an array of different \u201c clickbait \u201d articles , probing how misinformation preys on readers \u2019 emotions , and even getting students to try their hand at writing fake news stories themselves .\n\u201c What we want our students to do is \u2026 before they like or share in the social media they think twice \u2013 who has written this ? Where has it been published ? Can I find the same information from another source ? \u201d Kari Kivinen , director of Helsinki French-Finnish School and former secretary-general of the European Schools , told CNN .\nHe cautioned that it is a balancing act trying to make sure skepticism doesn \u2019 t give way to cynicism in students .\n\u201c It \u2019 s very annoying having to fact check everything , not being able to trust anything \u2026 or anyone on the internet , \u201d said 15-year-old Tatu Tukiainen , one of the students in Uitto \u2019 s class . \u201c I think we should try to put a stop to that . \u201d\nGabrielle Bagula ( left ) , 18 , and Alexander Shemeikka ( right ) , 17 , in the Helsinki French-Finnish School library .\nIn the school library , Alexander Shemeikka , 17 , and Gabrielle Bagula , 18 , are watching YouTube videos together on an iPhone and chatting about other social platforms where they get their news : Instagram , Snapchat , Reddit and Twitter but , notably , not Facebook \u2013 \u201c that \u2019 s for old people . \u201d\n\u201c The word \u2018 fake news \u2019 is thrown around very often , \u201d Shemeikka said , explaining that when their friends share dubious memes or far-fetched articles online he always asks for the source . \u201c You can never be too sure , \u201d Bagula agreed .\nThat \u2019 s exactly the type of conversation that Kivinen hopes to cultivate outside of the classroom .\nStudents aged 5 to 8 gather in the library to read paperbacks and scroll through social media feeds .\n\u201c What we have been developing here \u2013 combining fact-checking with the critical thinking and voter literacy \u2013 is something we have seen that there is an interest in outside Finland , \u201d Kivinen said .\nBut Kivinen isn \u2019 t sure that this approach could serve as a template for schools elsewhere . \u201c In the end \u2026 it \u2019 s difficult to export democracy , \u201d he added .\nIt may be difficult to export democracy , but it is easy to import experts , which is precisely what Finland did in 2016 to combat what it saw as a rise in disinformation emanating from accounts linked to its neighbor to the east .\n\u201c They knew that the Kremlin was messing with Finnish politics , but they didn \u2019 t have a context with which to interpret that . They were wondering if this meant they [ Russia ] would invade , was this war ? \u201d Jed Willard , director of the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Center for Global Engagement at Harvard University , who was hired by Finland to train state officials to spot and then hit back at fake news , told CNN .\nRussia maintains that it has not and does not interfere in the domestic politics of other countries .\nBehind closed doors , Willard \u2019 s workshops largely focused on one thing : developing a strong national narrative , rather than trying to debunk false claims .\n\u201c The Finns have a very unique and special strength in that they know who they are . And who they are is directly rooted in human rights and the rule of law , in a lot of things that Russia , right now , is not , \u201d Willard said . \u201c There is a strong sense of what it means to be Finnish \u2026 that is a super power . \u201d\nNot all nations have the type of narrative to fall back on that Finland does .\nTop marks for Finland Press Freedom Happiness 1 .

According to the Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2018 , Finland tops the charts for media trust , which means its citizens are less likely to turn to alternative sources for news .\nBut some argue that simply teaching media literacy and critical thinking isn \u2019 t enough \u2014 more must be done on the part of social media companies to stop the spread of disinformation .\n\u201c Facebook , Twitter , Google/YouTube \u2026 who are enablers of Russian trolls \u2026 they really should be regulated , \u201d said Jessikka Aro , a journalist with Finland \u2019 s public broadcaster YLE , who has faced a barrage of abuse for her work investigating Russian interference , long before it was linked to the 2016 US elections .\n\u201c Just like any polluting companies or factories should be and are already regulated , for polluting the air and the forests , the waters , these companies are polluting the minds of people . So , they also have to pay for it and take responsibility for it . \u201d\nFacebook , Twitter and Google , which are all signatories to the European Commission \u2019 s code of practice against disinformation , told CNN that they have taken steps ahead of the EU elections to increase transparency on their platforms , including making EU-specific political advertisement libraries publicly available , working with third-party fact-checkers to identify misleading election-related content , and cracking down on fake accounts .\nJessikka Aro scrolls through her Twitter mentions , pointing out the type of trolling and abuse she has faced online as a result of her investigations .\nAro \u2019 s first open-source investigation back in 2014 looked at how Russia-linked disinformation campaigns impacted Finns .\n\u201c Many Finns told me that they have witnessed these activities , but that it was only merely new digital technology for the old fashioned , old school Soviet Union propaganda , which has always existed and that Finns have been aware of , \u201d Aro said . \u201c So , they could avoid the trolls . \u201d\nThe probe also made her the target of a relentless smear campaign , accused of being a CIA operative , a secret assistant to NATO , a drug dealer and deranged Russophobe .\nAro received some respite when , last year , the Helsinki District Court handed harsh sentences to two pro-Putin activists on charges of defamation \u2013 Ilja Janitskin , a Finn of Russian descent who ran the anti-immigrant , pro-Russia website MV-Lehti , and Johan Backman , a self-declared \u201c human rights activist \u201d and frequent guest on the Russian state-run news outlet RT .\nIt was the first time that an EU country had convicted those responsible for disinformation campaigns , drawing a line in the sand between extreme hate speech and the pretense of free speech .\nPerhaps the biggest sign that Finland is winning the war on fake news is the fact that other countries are seeking to copy its blueprint . Representatives from a slew of EU states , along with Singapore , have come to learn from Finland \u2019 s approach to the problem .\nThe scene outside the Prime Minister \u2019 s Office in Helsinki . Since 2016 , government officials have trained over 10,000 Finns how to spot fake news .\nThe race is on to figure out a fix after authorities linked Russian groups to misinformation campaigns targeting Catalonia \u2019 s independence referendum and Brexit , as well as recent votes in France and Germany . Germany has already put a law in place to fine tech platforms that fail to remove \u201c obviously illegal \u201d hate speech , while France passed a law last year that bans fake news on the internet during election campaigns . Some critics have argued that both pieces of legislation jeopardize free speech . Russia denied interference in all of these instances .\nFinland \u2019 s strategy was on public display ahead of last month \u2019 s national elections , in an advertising campaign that ran under the slogan \u201c Finland has the world \u2019 s best elections \u2013 think about why \u201d and encouraged citizens to think about fake news .\nOfficials didn \u2019 t see any evidence of Russian interference in the vote , which Toivanen says may be a sign that trolls have stopped thinking of the Finnish electorate as a soft target .\nJussi Toivanen , who has traveled the country to train Finns , at his office in Helsinki .\n\u201c A couple of years ago , one of my colleagues said that he thought Finland has won the first round countering foreign-led hostile information activities . But even though Finland has been quite successful , I don \u2019 t think that there are any first , second or third rounds , instead , this is an ongoing game , \u201d Toivanen said .",

It was presented to the bloc\u2019s expert group on media literacy and has been shared among member states.\n\nThe exercises include examining claims found in YouTube videos and social media posts, comparing media bias in an array of different \u201cclickbait\u201d articles, probing how misinformation preys on readers\u2019 emotions, and even getting students to try their hand at writing fake news stories themselves.\n\n\u201cWhat we want our students to do is \u2026 before they like or share in the social media they think twice \u2013 who has written this? Where has it been published?

They were wondering if this meant they [Russia] would invade, was this war?\u201d Jed Willard, director of the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Center for Global Engagement at Harvard University, who was hired by Finland to train state officials to spot and then hit back at fake news, told CNN.\n\nRussia maintains that it has not and does not interfere in the domestic politics of other countries.\n\nBehind closed doors, Willard\u2019s workshops largely focused on one thing: developing a strong national narrative, rather than trying to debunk false claims.\n\n\u201cThe Finns have a very unique and special strength in that they know who they are. And who they are is directly rooted in human rights and the rule of law, in a lot of things that Russia, right now, is not,\u201d Willard said. \u201cThere is a strong sense of what it means to be Finnish \u2026 that is a super power.\u201d\n\nNot all nations have the type of narrative to fall back on that Finland does.\n\nTop marks for Finland Press Freedom Happiness 1.

Nicaragua Global Gender Gap Report 2018, 2019 World Press Freedom Index, Corruption Perceptions Index EU Social Justice Index 2017, Reporters Without Borders 2018, Transparency International Bertelsmann Stiftung World Economic Forum World Happiness Report 2019\n\nThe small and largely homogenous country consistently ranks at or near the top of almost every index \u2013 happiness, press freedom, gender equality, social justice, transparency and education \u2013 making it difficult for external actors to find fissures within society to crowbar open and exploit.\n\nFinland also has long tradition of reading \u2013 its 5.5 million people borrow close to 68 million books a year and it just spent $110 million on a state-of-the-art library, referred to lovingly as \u201cHelsinki\u2019s living room.\u201d Finland has the highest PISA score for reading performance in the EU.\n\nOn the Oodi library\u2019s ethereal third-floor, Finns browse the internet and leaf through national daily newspaper Helsingin Sanomat.\n\nAnd as trust in the media has flagged in other parts of the globe, Finland has maintained a strong regional press and public broadcaster. According to the Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2018, Finland tops the charts for media trust, which means its citizens are less likely to turn to alternative sources for news.\n\nPolluting the internet?\n\nBut some argue that simply teaching media literacy and critical thinking isn\u2019t enough \u2014 more must be done on the part of social media companies to stop the spread of disinformation.\n\n\u201cFacebook, Twitter, Google/YouTube \u2026 who are enablers of Russian trolls \u2026 they really should be regulated,\u201d said Jessikka Aro, a journalist with Finland\u2019s public broadcaster YLE, who has faced a barrage of abuse for her work investigating Russian interference, long before it was linked to the 2016 US elections.\n\n\u201cJust like any polluting companies or factories should be and are already regulated, for polluting the air and the forests, the waters, these companies are polluting the minds of people. So, they also have to pay for it and take responsibility for it.\u201d\n\nFacebook, Twitter and Google, which are all signatories to the European Commission\u2019s code of practice against disinformation, told CNN that they have taken steps ahead of the EU elections to increase transparency on their platforms, including making EU-specific political advertisement libraries publicly available, working with third-party fact-checkers to identify misleading election-related content, and cracking down on fake accounts.\n\nJessikka Aro scrolls through her Twitter mentions, pointing out the type of trolling and abuse she has faced online as a result of her investigations.\n\nAro\u2019s first open-source investigation back in 2014 looked at how Russia-linked disinformation campaigns impacted Finns.\n\n\u201cMany Finns told me that they have witnessed these activities, but that it was only merely new digital technology for the old fashioned, old school Soviet Union propaganda, which has always existed and that Finns have been aware of,\u201d Aro said. \u201cSo, they could avoid the trolls.\u201d\n\nThe probe also made her the target of a relentless smear campaign, accused of being a CIA operative, a secret assistant to NATO, a drug dealer and deranged Russophobe.\n\nAro received some respite when, last year, the Helsinki District Court handed harsh sentences to two pro-Putin activists on charges of defamation \u2013 Ilja Janitskin, a Finn of Russian descent who ran the anti-immigrant, pro-Russia website MV-Lehti, and Johan Backman, a self-declared \u201chuman rights activist\u201d and frequent guest on the Russian state-run news outlet RT.\n\nIt was the first time that an EU country had convicted those responsible for disinformation campaigns, drawing a line in the sand between extreme hate speech and the pretense of free speech.\n\nA never-ending game\n\nPerhaps the biggest sign that Finland is winning the war on fake news is the fact that other countries are seeking to copy its blueprint. Representatives from a slew of EU states, along with Singapore, have come to learn from Finland\u2019s approach to the problem.\n\nThe scene outside the Prime Minister\u2019s Office in Helsinki. Since 2016, government officials have trained over 10,000 Finns how to spot fake news.\n\nThe race is on to figure out a fix after authorities linked Russian groups to misinformation campaigns targeting Catalonia\u2019s independence referendum and Brexit, as well as recent votes in France and Germany. Germany has already put a law in place to fine tech platforms that fail to remove \u201cobviously illegal\u201d hate speech, while France passed a law last year that bans fake news on the internet during election campaigns. Some critics have argued that both pieces of legislation jeopardize free speech. Russia denied interference in all of these instances.\n\nFinland\u2019s strategy was on public display ahead of last month\u2019s national elections, in an advertising campaign that ran under the slogan \u201cFinland has the world\u2019s best elections \u2013 think about why\u201d and encouraged citizens to think about fake news.\n\nOfficials didn\u2019t see any evidence of Russian interference in the vote, which Toivanen says may be a sign that trolls have stopped thinking of the Finnish electorate as a soft target.\n\nJussi Toivanen, who has traveled the country to train Finns, at his office in Helsinki.\n\n\u201cA couple of years ago, one of my colleagues said that he thought Finland has won the first round countering foreign-led hostile information activities. But even though Finland has been quite successful, I don\u2019t think that there are any first, second or third rounds, instead, this is an ongoing game,\u201d Toivanen said.",
