But what happens if President Trump calls for a revolt on the international agreement and corporate America doesn \u2019 t show up ?\nIncreasingly , US businesses have been coming to the conclusion that they \u2019 re better off if the United States sticks with the Paris accord . Although it may seem counterintuitive , oil and gas companies ranging from ExxonMobil to Royal Dutch Shell , and even coal company Cloud Peak Energy , are pressing the Trump administration not to withdraw from the accord . The dearth of corporate support for a pullout makes it less likely the president will carry through on his campaign promise to \u201c cancel \u201d the agreement , although top administration officials are still reportedly leaning that way .\nThe corporate resistance also suggests that US companies are looking beyond the Trump administration and seeing more strategic advantage in helping to shape regulation , rather than trying to stop it cold .\n\u201c Companies are looking at the Trump administration policies and they \u2019 ve seen this before in the Reagan years , \u201d says Andrew Hoffman , a professor of sustainable enterprise at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor . \u201c And they say : \u2018 We 've seen the blowback \u2019 \u201d when President Reagan backtracked and replaced highly controversial appointments at the Interior Department and the Environmental Protection Administration with more mainstream figures .\nBusinesses support the Paris accord for a range of reasons \u2013 from the altruistic to the less-than-noble . For oil companies , instead of backing out of the accord , \u201c a smarter course would be to stay in Paris and weaken it from within , \u201d says Professor Hoffman .\nThat may sound cynical , but it \u2019 s actually a business axiom that may prove key in helping to garner support from other businesses for climate-friendly policies , sustainability experts say .\n\u201c My definition of sustainable is doing the right thing for the environment and making money \u2013 and it 's not always in that order , \u201d says Steve Hellem , president of Navista , a Washington-based public affairs group that helps companies and other entities meet their sustainability objectives . \u201c It 's the recognition that business will always do what is in its own best interest . \u201d\nMore and more businesses are concluding that action to address climate change is in their interests , according to a report released last week by World Wildlife Fund , Ceres , Calvert Research and Management , and CDP ( formerly , the Carbon Disclosure Project ) . Among Fortune 100 companies , 63 percent have set one or more clean energy targets ; among Fortune 500 companies , 48 percent have at least one climate or clean energy target , up 5 percent since a 2014 report . And the plans are increasingly ambitious , according to the report . IBM , Microsoft , and some 190 other Fortune 500 companies report saving nearly $ 3.7 billion in 2016 on energy efforts that reduced emissions by the equivalent of 45 coal-fired power plants .\nBeing climate-friendly is especially important to consumer-facing companies , which may explain why 72 percent of consumer staples firms in the Fortune 500 have set clean-energy goals . By contrast , the report finds that only 11 percent in the energy sector \u2013 where profits and carbon emissions often go hand-in-hand \u2013 have done the same .\nSome business leaders conclude it 's simply the right thing to do .
