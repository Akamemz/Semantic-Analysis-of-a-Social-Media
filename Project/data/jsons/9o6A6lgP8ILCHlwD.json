Only 14 % think policy decisions are often or always fact-based , or that Americans \u2019 voting decisions are rooted in facts .\nReporting by journalists scores slightly better with the public , but not by much : the survey found that only about 2 in 10 Americans believe media reporting is often or always based on facts . Roughly half of Americans think reporting is sometimes based on fact , while about a third say journalists never rely on facts .\nCoupled with a finding from the same survey that found many Americans have trouble verifying for themselves whether information is true , the poll paints a picture of a country deeply insecure about separating truth from falsehood .\n\u201c Lately , it seems like there \u2019 s been a war versus facts and reality , \u201d said Skye Hamm-Oliver , a 44-year-old Democrat in Lewiston , Idaho .\nWill Barger , a 32-year-old police officer in rural Missouri , has become increasingly skeptical of the media and voters alike in the past few years . A Republican and former regular viewer of Fox News who voted for President Donald Trump in 2016 , he \u2019 s become disillusioned with the president and the conservative cable channel and now trusts only local media .\nHe \u2019 s even less trusting in government and policy decisions , keeping his faith mainly in law-enforcement agencies . And he \u2019 s skeptical most voters are fact-driven .\n\u201c It \u2019 s more of a gut decision based on personal belief on a candidate , \u201d Barger said . What matters to most , he said , is \u201c if there \u2019 s an R in front of the name or a D in front of the name . \u201d\nOverall , 53 % of the public thinks voters sometimes cast ballots based on facts , while 32 % say they rarely or never do . Hamm-Oliver said voters in her home state of Idaho did so when they voted to approve a ballot measure last year that forced the state to accept the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act , which had previously been rejected by the state \u2019 s Republican-controlled legislature .\n\u201c But I have friends who \u2019 ve gone to vote and said \u2018 just because that \u2019 s a fact , that isn \u2019 t all there is , \u2019 \u201d she said .\nJoan McKee , a 65-year-old insurance broker who lives on the southern New Jersey shore and leans Democratic , said she thinks most decisions involving policy and elections rely only slightly more \u2014 at best \u2014 on fact than opinion .
