The experience was pretty much what you \u2019 d expect \u2013 paid temporary workers trying to remember their training , to varying degrees of success , in a community center \u2019 s gym with a bunch of other people looking to check the \u201c civic duty \u201d box . But something struck me this year that made me wonder what the point of citizenship is anymore .\nMy ballot in Maryland was in both English and Spanish . Maybe it \u2019 s been that way for years , I honestly don \u2019 t remember . On the way out the door , as always happens , someone tried to give me and my older daughter , a whole 17 months , an \u201c I voted \u201d sticker . I passed because I think they \u2019 re stupid and obnoxious \u2013 you shouldn \u2019 t celebrate doing what you \u2019 re supposed to do \u2013 but my wife , who took longer to vote because she skipped every race where there was only one person on the ballot , took one . It read , \u201c I voted , yo vote. \u201d It was then it occurred to me that the benefits of citizenship are either going away or pretty much gone .\nDon \u2019 t get me wrong , I still have pride in the country , but the country is changing significantly , or more correctly it \u2019 s being changed , in a dramatic way I \u2019 m not sure people are aware of .\nWhy would a ballot need to be written in English and Spanish when , by law , you \u2019 re expected to be proficient in English in order to become a citizen and , therefore , be eligible to vote ?\nWhat makes people \u201c Americans \u201d is being diluted and destroyed by Democrats willing to do anything to obtain power , except listen to the people they seek to represent .\nThere was a time , believe it or not , when immigrants came to this country with the desire to become an American , not a hyphenated American . There were always ethnic enclaves in major cities \u2013 a Little Italy , a Chinatown etc . \u2013 and immigrants moved there upon their arrivals . It made sense , they had limited to no English skills , so being able to communicate in their native tongue was understandable . But these enclaves were not their landing strips , it was their launching pads .\nImmigrants stayed in those enclaves only as long as they had to in order to learn the language , learn what it took to assimilate . Then they moved on .\nNow the opposite happens \u2013 immigrants are encouraged by Democrats to maintain their allegiance to their native land , to reject assimilation and maintain the cultures they , in many cases , fled . That leads to a nation of people with nothing in common and limited ability to communicate with each other . We never looked alike , but we could talk . It \u2019 s getting so we can \u2019 t anymore , and liberals love that .\nIf you never speak to anyone different from you , you get a perverted impression of the world . Just look at CNN and MSNBC . There is no debate there , only slight disagreements . They truly believe Donald Trump is lowering the discourse in this country and spreading hate while calling him Hitler , his supporters Nazis , and fantasizing about horrible things happening to the president , up to and including his assassination .\nThese same people insist encouraging assimilation into America by people seeking to become Americans is racist . \u201c Celebrate diversity , \u201d they scream , leaving off the implied \u201c or else . \u201d\nDiversity based on pigment is the least relevant and interesting thing human beings can be , let alone \u201c celebrate. \u201d Skin color has always been an obsession of racists , and it still is . It \u2019 s what we have in common that makes us a nation . But having things in common leads to getting along , and getting along isn \u2019 t in the Democrats \u2019 playbook . So they seek to divide so they can manipulate . As I explain in my book , if you can convince people \u201c the system is rigged against them , \u201d and they suffer the setbacks , disappointments , and jerks everyone encounters in life , those setbacks become discouragements from trying in the future . Why try when you believe you literally can \u2019 t win ?\nThis creates a mass of people convinced a political party acting on their behalf is the only way to get ahead , to make life \u201c fair. \u201d But life isn \u2019 t fair , life is what you make of it . And you don \u2019 t make anything of your life waiting for someone else , some political party , to run blocker for you or do your heavy lifting .\nDemocrats are removing what it means to be an American from actually being an American for their own political gain .\nNow the left is actively favoring illegal aliens over Americans and legal immigrants . Liberal jurisdictions across the country are spending untold millions of our tax dollars to defend people here illegally , granting in-state tuition , various forms of welfare benefits ( free meals as schools , picking up the tab for their health care , etc . ) , and voting rights in some areas for local elections ( for now ) .\nThey tell us illegal aliens are a boon to the economy , which is laughable . Some areas have gone so far as to plea down crimes by illegal aliens to avoid them getting on the radar of Immigration and Customs Enforcement . Would an American get that deal ? Of course not .\nFor an illegal alien to work in this country and \u201c pay taxes , \u201d as we \u2019 re told they do , they \u2019 d have to steal someone \u2019 s identity , someone \u2019 s Social Security number . That \u2019 s a serious crime with real victims , American victims of all backgrounds , and something for which American citizens would do real time for committing , but illegal aliens committing it is ignored .\nSo what \u2019 s the point of citizenship ? We aren \u2019 t granted special protections by government officials , we \u2019 re subject to our laws . People who break our laws to come here have a political party willing to bend over backwards to make sure they aren \u2019 t . Immigrants who come here legally aren \u2019 t encouraged to assimilate , they get ballots in their native tongue . How can you fully invest in a country if you can \u2019 t communicate in the common language ?\nI want everyone with something to offer to come here , legally , and become an American . Democrats want anyone to come here , as long as they \u2019 re likely to vote for Democrats .\nIf Democrats regain power next week , what it means to be an American will be diluted even further . We just have to decide if we want to be a nation where it 's more advantageous to be here illegally than to be a citizen .
