He has purposefully skirted Congress for the better part of seven years , instead pushing ahead on his mostly unpopular agenda through regulations and executive orders . As a result , the Court is being asked to act as referee , ruling on the legality of Obama \u2019 s \u201c my way or the highway \u201d presidency . You don \u2019 t change a referee in the middle of a contest .\nThis isn \u2019 t about Judge Robert Bork , or the \u201c Biden Rule \u201d -- this is a fight about President Obama undermining the checks and balances established in the Constitution .\nFor instance , President Obama has tried to essentially shut down our coal industry through new EPA regulations limiting carbon emissions . These rules would create a massive dislocation to our economy , which has long benefited from cheap energy , including abundant coal .

As reported in the New York Times , \u201c The plan could transform the nation \u2019 s electricity system , cutting emissions from existing power plants by a third by 2030 , from a 2005 baseline , by closing hundreds of heavily polluting coal-fired plants and increasing production of wind and solar power . \u201d\nBecause of the sizeable cost to the economy , lower courts have ruled against the president \u2019 s anti-coal regulatory blitz . The Supreme Court , in an unprecedented move , issued a stay requested by 29 states and numerous other groups which prevents implementation of the carbon rule while a lower court assesses its legality . In effect , the courts will rule on whether the White House is allowed to unilaterally punish one of our heritage industries and tens of thousands of workers .\nAnother important issue before the Supreme Court is President Obama \u2019 s executive action allowing some 6 million people living in the country illegally to be protected against deportation . This unilateral effort to rewrite our immigration laws is opposed by a majority of Americans ; but , it is a politically useful policy for Democrats hoping to win Latino votes .
