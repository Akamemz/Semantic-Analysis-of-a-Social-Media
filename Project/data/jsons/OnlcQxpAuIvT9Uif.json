    "content": "Immigration is the most-heated domestic policy topic today . Leave aside questions about whether members of MS-13 , a violent gang started in Los Angeles , are `` animals '' or not and you still have Donald Trump dismissing migrants from `` shithole countries '' , members of Congress such as Rep. Steve King ( R-Iowa ) railing against `` somebody else 's baby '' , and Republicans pushing to reduce legal immigration by 50 percent . Democrats these days are mostly welcoming to `` dreamers '' but we 're just a few years removed from the policies of Barack Obama , who was arguably the `` most anti-immigrant president since Eisenhower '' and had no trouble deporting millions of Latinos and raiding workplaces suspected of employing undocumented workers .\nOpponents of immigrants and immigration take their cues from President Trump , who opened his campaign for the Republican nomination by denouncing illegals entering from Mexico as nothing less than a criminal horde :\nWhen Mexico sends its people , they 're not sending their best . They 're not sending you . They 're not sending you . They 're sending people that have lots of problems , and they 're bringing those problems with us . They 're bringing drugs . They 're bringing crime . They 're rapists . And some , I assume , are good people .\nOpponents advance a host of other , sometimes contradictory arguments to make their case . Immigrants , they say , are lazy and soak up massive amounts of welfare even while they are willing to work harder and for less money than natives ( a paradox known as `` Schrodinger 's Immigrant '' ) . The litany also includes : Immigrants bring down wages , illegals make a joke of the rule of law , newcomers do n't learn English , they vote Democratic , they destroy common culture , they are hotbeds of terrorism and crime , and on and on .\nSupporters of current or expanded levels of immigration ( I 'm one ) dutifully rebut all these arguments and more by pointing to relevant data , economic theory , and history . We also underscore American ideals of inclusion and a history of immigrant entrepreneurship , among other things .\nNeedless to say , the two sides rarely convince one another , or even come to a common understanding of what facts are true and relevant .\nWhich makes a column appearing in today 's Wall Street Journal all the more interesting . Gerald F. Seib lays out a series of facts that I think everyone can agree on . They provide an excellent starting point for a different discussion about immigration , one that foregrounds the very sort of economic issues that both diehard Trump supporters and proponents of immigration can agree on . Among them :\nUnemployment is at 3.9 percent , the lowest it has been in 17 years .\n`` There are 6.6 million job openings in the U.S. , which means that , for the first time in history , there are enough openings to provide a job for every unemployed person in the country . ''\nEmployers all over the country\u2014Seib mentions Maryland crab processors , Alaskan fisheries , farmers in the heartland , and New Hampshire restaurants\u2014 '' all say they are critically short of workers . ''\nThe relatively few slots for annual H-1B and H-2B visas ( for skilled and unskilled workers , respectively ) have been filled at record paces this year already .\n`` The [ National Federation of Independent Business ] says that 22 % of small-business owners say finding qualified workers is their single most important business problem , more than those who cite taxes or regulations . ''\nThat 's a portrait of an economy that is stuck in second gear , unable to expand to meet increasing demand and grow . Given the general listlessness of the American economy for virtually the entirety of the 21st century , in which annual economic growth has averaged under 2 percent ( compared to about 3 percent from 1950 to 2000 ) , we may not be immediately capable of recognizing the opportunity in front of us .\nThe long-term prospects for a healthy economy face real problems , reports Seib , including :\n`` The fertility rate for women aged 15 to 44 was 60.2 births per 1,000 women , the lowest since the government began tracking that rate more than a century ago . ''\nOver the next three decades , the percentage of Americans over the age of 65 will become larger than the percentage under the age of 18 , `` a historic crossing of demographic lines . ''\nOther sources underscore that immigration and births to immigrants , who tend to have more children than native-born women , are the only reasons why America 's population is growing slightly . Unless it is supplemented by immigration , the decline in birth rates will disastrously sink the labor market in years to come . To get a sense of what happens when a country ages dramatically and does n't replenish its population with younger residents , look to ultra-restrictionist Japan , which is the prime example of a First World `` demographic disaster . '' Japan , which has fewer people than it did in 2000 , is suffering a slow-motion economic collapse characterized by weak-to-nonexistent economic growth and an erosion of quality of life . As The Weekly Standard 's Jonathan V. Last wrote in What to Expect When No One 's Expecting : America 's Coming Demographic Disaster , Japan 's `` continuously falling birthrates '' has given rise to `` a subculture that dresses dogs like babies and pushes them around in carriages , and a booming market in hyper-realistic-looking robot babies .
