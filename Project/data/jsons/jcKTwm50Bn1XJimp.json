    "content": "President Obama , assuming again the role of war-time president , used a United Nations address on Wednesday to urge broad international support in confronting the Islamic State and other terror groups -- while repeating his 2009 pledge that the U.S. is not `` at war with Islam . ''\nSpeaking as the U.S. launches an expanded military campaign against the Islamic State , Obama said nations are staring into the `` heart of darkness '' with the violence in Iraq and Syria driven by the terror group . He urged nations to `` reject the cancer of violent extremism , '' and said defeating the Islamic State , or ISIS , is the first step .\n`` The only language understood by killers like this is the language of force . So the United States of America will work with a broad coalition to dismantle this network of death , '' Obama declared . The president said over 40 nations have offered to join the coalition and added : `` Today , I ask the world to join in this effort . ''\nAt the same time , Obama stressed the important role that Muslim communities can play in rejecting extremist ideology . Regarding Syria 's civil war , he again said the only solution to that country 's bloodshed is a `` political '' one .\nAnd , repeating a line he delivered during a 2009 address in Turkey shortly after taking office , he said America is not `` at war with Islam . ''\n`` When it comes to America and Islam , there is no us and them -- there is only us , '' Obama said , while stressing that `` America will not base our entire foreign policy on reacting to terrorism . ''\nThe tone of the address underscored the complicated situation Obama finds himself in , after running for office six years ago in part on staunch opposition to the Iraq war and as the foreign policy antithesis of George W. Bush . The president has since committed the nation to a fight against the Islamic State that military advisers say could last years -- but , stressing the differences in this war , Obama is vowing not to `` occupy '' other countries and to leave fighting on the ground to U.S.-trained foreign forces .\nObama spoke two days after the U.S. and Arab allies launched a barrage of airstrikes in Syria against Islamic State and other targets .\nThe strikes continued on Wednesday , with the Pentagon reporting the U.S. conducted two more airstrikes on an Islamic State staging area in eastern Syria . Rear Adm. John Kirby said the target was an area used by the militants to move equipment across the border into Iraq .\nIn the Syria operation , Bahrain , Saudi Arabia , Jordan and the United Arab Emirates joined the U.S. earlier this week in carrying out airstrikes , while Qatar played a supporting role .\nThe airstrikes were not only aimed at ISIS , but also an Al Qaeda-linked terror cell called The Khorasan Group , which the Pentagon said was nearing the `` execution phase '' of a direct attack on the U.S. or Europe .\nObama addressed a range of topics beyond Middle East terrorism in his speech to the U.N. General Assembly . He touched on the Ebola crisis in West Africa and also repeatedly condemned Russia 's actions in the conflict in eastern Ukraine .\n`` We will impose a cost on Russia , '' Obama said . So far , those costs largely have come in the form of sanctions , and the Obama administration has not agreed to Ukrainian pleas for military aid .\nMeanwhile , the British parliament is expected to be recalled Friday to discuss a possible role for the U.K. in airstrikes against ISIS . The BBC reported that Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi will formally request that Britain join in the campaign . Both al-Abadi and his British counterpart , David Cameron , are in New York this week for the U.N. General Assembly .\nCameron told NBC News Tuesday evening that the fight against ISIS was a battle `` you can not opt out of .\n`` It has oil , it has money , it has territory , it has weapons , and there 's no doubt in my mind it has already undertaken and is planning further plots in Europe and elsewhere , '' Cameron said .\nThe BBC reported that any British involvement against ISIS would be limited to Iraq , but not Syria due to concerns raised by the opposition Labour Party . That party 's leader , Ed Miliband , told the BBC that any proposed airstrikes against ISIS in Syria would need to be backed by a U.N. Security Council resolution . Such a prospect is unlikely due to the influence of Russia , which holds a veto on the council and has roundly criticized this week 's U.S.-led airstrikes .\nObama was scheduled to meet with al-Abadi following his General Assembly speech .\nOn Wednesday afternoon , Obama also convened an unusual meeting of the U.N. Security Council , during which members unanimously adopted a resolution that would require all countries to prevent the recruitment and transport of would-be foreign fighters preparing to join terrorist groups such as the Islamic State group .\nHowever , Obama administration officials have acknowledged that U.N. resolutions can be notoriously difficult to enforce .\nWhile Obama faces pressure from some Democratic lawmakers to limit U.S. involvement in the new fight , others are pressuring him to keep the door open to using U.S. ground troops . `` We and our partners will ultimately need a limited presence of troops on the ground-not to invade and occupy Syria or Iraq , but to advise local forces , direct air strikes , gather intelligence , and conduct special forces operations , among other related missions , '' Sens .
