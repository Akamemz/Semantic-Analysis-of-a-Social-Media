As I explained in a previous column at Forbes , in both systems a third-party payer pays a good portion of the bill , leaving consumers and producers with perverse incentives to take advantage of it . The financing of both systems is dysfunctional . There is much waste and inefficiency . And low-income families are the least well served .\nWe spend about twice as much as other developed countries as a fraction of national output . Yet our results are mediocre . Public and private spending is growing much faster than our income ? putting us on a course that is clearly unsustainable . It appears we are buying quantity instead of value .
