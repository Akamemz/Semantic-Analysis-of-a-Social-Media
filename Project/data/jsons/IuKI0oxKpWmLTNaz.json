But a \u2588\u2588\u2588 analysis of public opinion over the last four years suggests that Trump \u2019 s brand of white identity politics may be less effective in the 2020 election campaign .\nThe analysis comes amid widespread criticism of Trump \u2019 s racially charged comments about four minority women lawmakers and the fallout from a mass shooting of Hispanics in El Paso , Texas , that many Democratic presidential candidates swiftly blamed on the president \u2019 s rhetoric .\n\u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos polling of 4,436 U.S. adults in July showed that people who rejected racial stereotypes were more interested in voting in the 2020 general election than those who expressed stronger levels of anti-black or anti-Hispanic biases .\nIn 2016 , it was the reverse . The \u2588\u2588\u2588 analysis shows that Trump \u2019 s narrow win came at a time when Americans with strong anti-black opinions were the more politically engaged group . While \u2588\u2588\u2588 did not measure anti-Hispanic biases in 2016 , political scientists say that people who express them closely overlap with those who are biased against other racial minorities .\nThis year \u2019 s poll found that among Americans who feel that blacks and whites are equal , or that blacks are superior to whites , 82 % expressed a strong interest in voting in 2020 . That was 7 percentage points higher than people who feel strongly that whites are superior to blacks .\n\u201c There is some indication that racial liberals are more energized than the racially intolerant , \u201d said University of Michigan political scientist Vincent Hutchings , who reviewed \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 findings . \u201c That would seem to be good news for the Democrats and bad news for the Republicans . \u201d\nThe July poll did have a silver lining for Trump . Most white Republicans approve of his performance in office . And over the past four years they have become increasingly supportive of his signature issue : expanding the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border . Some 82 % now support it compared to 75 % last year .\nTrump is clearly still as popular as ever with conservatives who dominate the predominantly white , working-class communities that helped him win in 2016 , said Duke University political scientist Ashley Jardina , who also reviewed the poll findings .\nIn his 2016 campaign , Trump focused on the grievances of white voters who feared the global economy was leaving them behind and who wanted more restrictions on immigration . He employed put-downs of Latino immigrants and inner-city , typically black , residents .\nHe said then that Mexicans were \u201c murderers \u201d and \u201c rapists , \u201d and as recently as last year , Trump labeled illegal immigration to the United States an \u201c invasion . \u201d\nTrump has asserted repeatedly that his words are not meant to be racially divisive . \u201c I think my rhetoric ... brings people together , \u201d he said earlier this month .\nResponding to the \u2588\u2588\u2588 polling analysis , a spokesman for Trump \u2019 s reelection campaign , Daniel Bucheli , said the president \u201c enjoys broad support from diverse groups of Americans , and this coalition of supporters , to include minorities and first time voters , continues to grow daily . \u201d\n\u201c If there is something we \u2019 ve come to learn about President Trump is that he calls it like it is , \u201d Bucheli said , when asked about Trump \u2019 s recent comments about the lawmakers and others .\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment on the poll findings .\nThe \u2588\u2588\u2588 analysis also found that Americans were less likely to express feelings of racial anxiety this year , and they were more likely to empathize with African Americans . This was also true for white Americans and whites without a college degree , who largely backed Trump in 2016 .\nWhite Americans are also 19 percentage points more supportive of a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants and 4 points less supportive of increased deportations , when their responses from the July poll were compared with a \u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos poll in January 2015 .\nThe July 17-22 poll also found that 29 % of whites agreed that \u201c America must protect and preserve its White European heritage , \u201d down 7 points from a \u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos poll conducted in August 2017 and 9 points down from another \u2588\u2588\u2588/Ipsos poll in August 2018 .\nThe poll also found that 17 % of whites and 26 % of white Republicans said they strongly agree that \u201c white people are currently under attack in this country , a drop of about 6 points and 8 points respectively from 2017 .\nPaula Ioanide , an expert in American race relations at Ithaca College , said the poll findings were consistent with her research that racial anxieties among whites peaked during the presidency of Barack Obama .\nSome white Americans \u201c are not feeling as under attack as they did in 2016 , \u201d Ioanide said .
