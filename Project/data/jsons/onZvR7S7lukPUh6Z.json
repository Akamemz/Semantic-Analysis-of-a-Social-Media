    "content": "So let \u2019 s imagine that on Saturday night , the news had emerged not that Bowe Bergdahl was being freed but that he \u2019 d been murdered by his Taliban captors . What do you suppose we \u2019 d be hearing from Republican legislators ? You know exactly what : Barack Obama is the weakest president ever , this is unconscionable . Which , of course , is exactly what we \u2019 re hearing from them now that the U.S. Army sergeant , held by the Taliban since 2009 , has been freed . And it \u2019 s going to get worse . I \u2019 m even tempted to say forget Benghazi\u2014Bergdahl may well end up being the flimsy excuse for the impeachment hearings they \u2019 ve been dreaming of before all this is over .\nThe Republicans \u2019 audacity here is a bit beyond the usual . Let \u2019 s face it : There is no question that if President George W. Bush or a President McCain or President Romney had secured Bergdahl \u2019 s release in exchange for five Taliban prisoners at Gitmo , Republicans would be defending the move all the way . That business about notifying Congress ? They \u2019 d have a dozen excuses for it . We got our prisoner of war home , they \u2019 d all be saying . That \u2019 s what matters .\nBut Obama does it , and Bergdahl \u2019 s freedom isn \u2019 t what matters at all . It \u2019 s that we negotiated with terrorists . Well , yes . We \u2019 ve been negotiating with the Taliban for a long time now , trying to end the war . See , they \u2019 re the people leading the fighting on the other side . When you \u2019 re trying to end a war , that \u2019 s generally who you negotiate with .\nThe five guys we returned to the Taliban are really bad guys , as Eli Lake and Josh Rogin wrote this weekend , and it \u2019 s fair to ask whether the price was too high .
