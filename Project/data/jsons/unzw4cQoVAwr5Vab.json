    "content": "By all accounts , Vladimir Putin won \u2019 t be having any substantive meetings this weekend with President Trump in Paris at a ceremony marking the end of World War I . But that \u2019 s not for lack of interest . Mr. Putin appears keen to do so , despite what many Russian foreign policy experts say has been a relationship largely toxic to the Kremlin . Their meeting in Helsinki in July set off a storm of recriminations in the US media that painted the US president as a Kremlin stooge , and Congress ramped up sanctions on Moscow . Later the White House announced that it will pull out of the landmark INF treaty , which ended the cold war . And the US midterm results , which brought the Democrats back into control of the House , will only make it more difficult for Putin to negotiate with Mr. Trump . \u201c Putin and Trump have met twice , in Hamburg and Helsinki , and it \u2019 s hard to find any reason to believe that the Russian investment in those meetings brought any benefits at all , \u201d says Fyodor Lukyanov , editor of Russia in Global Affairs . \u201c I am baffled why the Russian side continues to initiate any dialogue with Trump or see it as a desirable thing to do . The sad fact is that Russia has become a meme in US politics , and as a meme you can \u2019 t change much . \u201d\nDonald Trump and Vladimir Putin will most likely meet in some fashion this Sunday at a World War I memorial event in Paris . It will probably be brief and light on substance \u2013 perhaps no more than a handshake and a greeting .\nBut all eyes will be on the chemistry between the two leaders whose oft-stated joint goal \u2013 to improve relations between their countries \u2013 has been so profoundly frustrated at every turn in the past two years .\nA lot has changed since they last met in Helsinki in July \u2013 and not in Russia \u2019 s favor , according to much of Russia \u2019 s foreign policy community .\nThey have come to regard contact with Mr. Trump as toxic for Mr. Putin , after a storm of post-Helsinki recriminations in the US media painted the US president as a Kremlin stooge and Congress ramped up sanctions on Moscow .\nLater , the White House announced that it will pull out of the landmark INF treaty , the deal that ended the old cold war . Then , the US midterm elections brought Trump \u2019 s Democratic opponents roaring back into control of the House , where they appear almost certain to raise the heat still further on Russia .\nRussian analysts familiar with the US political process say that is not because Democrats are significantly more anti-Russian than their Republican counterparts \u2013 punishing Russia is one of the few areas of strong bipartisan consensus . Rather , they will be in a more effective position to challenge any Moscow-friendly initiatives made by the White House . Trump , the analysts point out , is almost unique among US politicians in advocating better relations with Russia , and he will now be under far more pressure to abandon that position .\n\u201c Most Russian observers think the split in the US leadership will only deepen .
