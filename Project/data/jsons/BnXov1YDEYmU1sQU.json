Egypt painfully familiar for Obama\n\nPresident Barack Obama insisted Monday that he isn\u2019t taking sides in the standoff between Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi and millions of protesters who\u2019ve taken to the streets to protest his policies.\n\nBut that\u2019s not likely to be enough for many in those angry crowds, who seem firmly convinced that the White House has bolstered the Muslim Brotherhood leader, even as ordinary Egyptians \u2014 and some in his own Cabinet \u2014 have grown increasingly dissatisfied with his rule.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAs the Egyptian military issued what appeared to be an ultimatum Monday for Morsi and the opposition to sort out their differences within 48 hours, Obama found himself in a painfully familiar place \u2014 facing questions about whether the United States has, once again, invested too much in a helpful but flawed Middle Eastern leader while paying insufficient attention to burgeoning popular discontent.\n\n( PHOTOS: Scenes from Egypt)\n\nIt\u2019s the same set of questions that dogged Obama throughout the Arab Spring, when he wrestled with the dilemma of precisely when to ditch a string of besieged leaders, from Libya\u2019s Muammar Qadhafi to Egypt\u2019s previous president, Hosni Mubarak.\n\n\u201cOur commitment to Egypt has never been around any particular individual or party,\u201d Obama said Monday in Tanzania, the final leg of his week-long Africa trip. \u201cOur commitment has been to a process.\u201d\n\nThe president acknowledged that the United States had worked with Morsi. But, he suggested, that shouldn\u2019t be mistaken for enthusiasm about his rule.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. government\u2019s attitude has been we would deal with a democratically elected government,\u201d said Obama. \u201cDemocracy is not just about elections \u2014 it\u2019s also about how are you working with an opposition?\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Obama on Egypt: Commitment to a process, not individual)\n\nObama\u2019s comments about Morsi seemed decidedly less effusive than the praise the Egyptian president won from the White House last November, when an official statement credited him for his \u201cpersonal leadership\u201d in helping to broker a halt to fighting between Israel and the Hamas-led government in the Gaza Strip.\n\nJust a day after Obama publicly thanked Morsi and \u201creaffirmed the close partnership between the United States and Egypt,\u201d the Egyptian leader triggered another round of widespread protests by announcing a decree that granted himself virtually unlimited power.\n\nNow, some analysts believe the administration may have had too much faith in Morsi as a \u201cpractical\u201d leader who could satisfy Islamist elements in Egypt while managing both the opposition and the economy.\n\n( PHOTOS: Elections in Egypt)\n\nObama administration officials \u201cwere more inclined to give [Morsi] and his movement the great benefit of the doubt and also to see that there was no practical alternative to keep Egypt at least stable,\u201d said David Pollock of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.",
