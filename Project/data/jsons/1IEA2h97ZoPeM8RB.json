    "content": "Human remains recovered from the crash site of EgyptAir Flight 804 showed burn marks and were `` very tiny , '' suggesting an explosion brought down the plane , a senior Egyptian forensics official told the Associated Press Tuesday .\nMeanwhile , a U.S. official briefed on the latest intelligence told Fox News , `` All signs continue to point to terrorism . ''\nThe official who spoke to the AP claimed he personally examined the remains of some of the plane 's 66 passengers and crew at a Cairo morgue . He said all 80 pieces brought to Cairo so far are small and that `` there is n't even a whole body part , like an arm or a head . ''\nHe added that at least one part of an arm had signs of burns -- an indication it might have `` belonged to a passenger sitting next to the explosion . ''\nThe U.S. official speaking to Fox News said American satellites could have missed a potential explosion over the eastern Mediterranean . `` Contrary to popular belief , we can not see every part of the earth all the time . ''\nThe official said most U.S. satellites would be trained to positons on land and known areas of interest and not focused over an empty part of the sea , particularly the eastern Mediterranean .\nThe official would not rule out an explosion took place . To date , no terrorist group has claimed responsibility for the EgyptAir disaster .\nThe Airbus A320 crashed early Thursday morning near the end of a fight from Paris to Cairo .\nAn independent Cairo newspaper , al-Watan , quoted an unnamed forensics official Tuesday as saying the plane blew up in midair , but that it was unclear whether the blast was caused by the an explosive device or something else . The official also said the remains retrieved so far are `` no larger than the size of a hand . ''\nBut Egypt \u2019 s head of forensics denied the statements Tuesday , Reuters reported , citing state news agency MENA .\n`` Everything published about this matter is completely false , and mere assumptions that did not come from the Forensics Authority , '' MENA quoted Hesham Abdelhamid as saying .\nAnalysts who spoke to Fox News also said the body parts could have been broken up in a similar way upon impact with water .\nFamily members of the victims arrived Tuesday at a Cairo morgue \u2019 s forensics department to give DNA samples to help identify the remains of their kin , a security official said . The official also spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters .\nAn international effort to hunt for the plane 's cockpit voice and data recorder resumed Tuesday , with ships and planes from Britain , Cyprus , France , Greece and the United States taking part in the search .\nThe search area is roughly halfway between Egypt 's coastal city of Alexandria and the Greek island of Crete , where the water is 8,000 to 10,000 feet deep .\nThe head of Egypt 's state-run provider of air navigation services , Ehab Azmy , told The Associated Press Monday that the plane did not swerve or lose altitude before it disappeared off radar , challenging an earlier account by Greece 's defense minister .\nAzmy , head of the National Air Navigation Services Company , said that in the minutes before the plane disappeared , it was flying at its normal altitude of 37,000 feet , according to the radar reading . `` That fact degrades what the Greeks are saying about the aircraft suddenly losing altitude before it vanished from radar , '' he added .\n`` There was no turning to the right or left , and it was fine when it entered Egypt 's FIR ( flight information region ) , which took nearly a minute or two before it disappeared , '' Azmy said .\nGreece 's defense minister , Panos Kammenos , had said the plane swerved wildly and dropped to 10,000 feet before it fell off radar .\nGreek civil aviation authorities said the flight appeared normal until air traffic controllers were to hand it over to their Egyptian counterparts .
