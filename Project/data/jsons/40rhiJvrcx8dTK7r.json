    "content": "As voters head to the polls in the 2018 midterm elections Tuesday , a string of East Coast races could be early indicators on which party will win the battle for control of the U.S. House , while the fight for the U.S. Senate runs through a slate of tossup states that are in later time zones . Here \u2019 s your guide to watching the results roll in on Election Day , based on East Coast times .\nThe first polls begin closing at 6 p.m. Eastern in Kentucky and Indiana .\nKentucky and Indiana : Indiana has some polls closing at 6 p.m. Eastern . But the key race to watch is in Kentucky : the state \u2019 s sixth congressional district in Lexington . The seat is currently held by Republican Rep. Andy Barr , who represents an area where the GOP typically does well , but he is facing a well-financed opponent in retired Marine pilot Amy McGrath , a Democrat .\nPolls start to close in four key states : Virginia , Georgia , Florida and also Indiana , where a last batch of polls close in a state that is in two time zones . Polls also close in South Carolina .\nFlorida : Democrat Andrew Gillum , the mayor of Tallahassee , has attracted a grassroots following of young people and minorities . The party hopes Mr. Gillum \u2019 s campaign for governor against the GOP \u2019 s Ron DeSantis can bring more Democrats to the polls , all the while lifting the fortunes of incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson , who is being challenged for his Senate seat by outgoing Republican Gov . Rick Scott .\nOn the House side , the four most competitive races to watch are all prime pick opportunities for the Democrats : FL-26 and FL-27 , two GOP-held districts that encompass part of the Miami-Dade region ; FL-15 outside Tampa ; and FL-16 in Sarasota County .\nIndiana : Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly , one of the party \u2019 s most vulnerable incumbents , is being challenged by businessman Mike Braun . Republicans are looking to capture this seat to expand their 51-49 Senate majority or to create a buffer to offset loses elsewhere .\nGeorgia : The governor \u2019 s race between progressive former state lawmaker Stacey Abrams and Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp , a Republican , is one of the most watched in the country . She could make history by becoming the first black female governor in the U.S .\nVirginia : There are several opportunities for House Democrats to pick up seats . Rep. Barbara Comstock , an incumbent in the Washington , D.C. , suburbs , is considered among the most vulnerable Republicans as she squares off against Democrat Jennifer Wexton .\nA more significant bellwether could be in Virginia \u2019 s second congressional district , where GOP Rep. Scott Taylor faces a stiff challenge from Democratic businesswoman Elaine Luria . And Republican Rep. Dave Brat , who ousted Majority Leader Eric Cantor in a 2014 primary , is now in danger of losing his seat to Democrat Abigail Spanberger .\nPolls start to close in three states : North Carolina , Ohio and West Virginia .\nOhio : The governor \u2019 s race in Ohio is nationally watched because 2016 GOP presidential candidate John Kasich is leaving the governor \u2019 s mansion due to term limits . Republican Mike DeWine faces Democrat Richard Cordray in the race to follow Mr. Kasich .\nA rematch in Ohio \u2019 s 12th congressional district in suburban Columbus could also be telling . Rep . Troy Balderson won a special election there this year\u2014but just barely beating Democrat Danny O \u2019 Connor\u2014signaling the GOP \u2019 s weakening grip in suburbia .\nWest Virginia : Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin \u2019 s state voted for President Trump in 2016 by 42 percentage points . Yet , Mr. Manchin is leading attorney general Patrick Morrisey in public polling , and a victory would demonstrate that a candidate \u2019 s personal brand can outweigh party affiliation .\nAt 8 p.m. Eastern , the largest set of states will close , including eight states with competitive Senate races . Statewide competitive races 8 p.m. : Senate S TN MI PA MO MS TX ND IL CT NJ G Governor KS OK MD RI SD Other states closing : DE AL MA ME AR Competitive House races closing Democrat-held Republican-held Tossup Likely Democrat Lean Republican Likely Republican Lean Democrat\nPolls start to close in Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Kansas , Maine , Massachusetts , Maryland , Michigan , Mississippi , Missouri , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , South Dakota , Tennessee and Texas .\nKansas : The governor \u2019 s race is a tossup between Republican Kris Kobach and Democrat Laura Kelly , and there are two potential House upsets . GOP Rep. Kevin Yoder \u2019 s seat in the third House district is at risk of falling into the Democratic column , as the race now leans in favor of challenger Sharice Davids . There is also a tossup race for an open seat in the state \u2019 s second congressional district , where Rep. Lynn Jenkins , a Republican , is retiring .\nMichigan : GOP Rep. Mike Bishop , whose eighth district includes a swath of the Detroit suburbs , faces a tough challenger in Elissa Slotkin , a former CIA case officer , creating a key pick-up opportunity for Democrats .\nMississippi : There are two Senate races in the state , but one of them is unlikely to be decided Tuesday night . That \u2019 s because GOP Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith isn \u2019 t the only Republican vying for the seat : Republican Chris McDaniel is running against her , as is Democrat Mike Espy , creating a three-way race . The top two vote-getters advance to a Nov. 27 runoff if none of them can claim an outright majority of the vote on Election Day , under Mississippi election rules .\nMissouri : Sen. Claire McCaskill is another endangered Democrat in the Senate . She faces state Attorney General Josh Hawley . President Trump made two trips to the state in the final days to try to knock off Ms. McCaskill .\nNew Jersey : Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez , plagued by questions over his ethics despite escaping conviction in a corruption trial last year , is unpopular in a state that leans Democratic . He faces GOP businessman Bob Hugin . If Republicans can defeat Mr. Menendez , it would bode well for their ability to maintain control of the Senate .\nPennsylvania : There are four competitive U.S. House races in Pennsylvania , all of them pick-up opportunities for the Democrats , and they are looking here to make a strong down payment on their path toward a majority . Republicans have called this \u201c ground zero \u201d in the battle for House control . Several districts moved further out of reach for Republicans due to court-issued redistricting in the state .\nTennessee : The open Senate seat in Tennessee\u2014Republican Sen. Bob Corker is retiring\u2014is critical to Democrats if they have any hope of gaining ground in the chamber . Former Gov . Phil Bredesen , who was endorsed by singer Taylor Swift , is challenging Rep. Marsha Blackburn , who benefited from a Trump endorsement .\nTexas : Can Democratic Rep. Beto O \u2019 Rourke topple GOP Sen. Ted Cruz in a deep-red state ? It would be one of the biggest political upsets in the history of the Senate , and a signal that the Lone Star state could be in play during the 2020 presidential race .\nAlso in Texas , Democrats are targeting Republican Reps. Pete Sessions in a district outside Dallas and John Culberson of Houston , both in tossup races . A defeat of Rep. Will Hurd , who is facing Democrat Gina Ortiz-Jones , would signal a difficult night for Republicans .\nAt 9 p.m. , polls start closing in Minnesota , which includes the only toss up and lean Republican seats held by Democrats . Statewide competitive races 9 p.m. : Senate S AZ MN CO WI G Governor Other states closing : NY NM NE WY LA Competitive House races closing Republican-held Democrat-held Lean Democrat Likely Republican Lean Republican Likely Democrat Tossup\nOfficials start counting ballots in Arizona , Colorado , Minnesota , Nebraska , New Mexico , New York and Wisconsin .\nArizona : An open Senate seat creates a rare opening for Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema to gain a seat for her party , but her fight against Rep. Martha McSally has been extremely tight . The seat is open because Sen. Jeff Flake , a Republican , is retiring .\nMinnesota : Four races in Minnesota are a bellwether for control of the House . Both parties agree that if Democrats win in three of these four districts , it would be a bad sign for the GOP elsewhere in the country . The four races are :\nMN-01 : Democrats currently hold this seat in rural Minnesota . If they can hang on , it may mean they are faring better in rural areas than they often get credit for . Democrat Dan Feehan faces Republican Jim Hagedorn in that open-seat race .\nMN-02 : GOP Rep. Jason Lewis faces a stiff challenge from Democrat Angie Craig in outskirts of the Twin Cities .\nMN-03 : Republican Rep. Erik Paulsen faces Democrat Dean Phillips , presenting another test for the GOP in the suburbs .\nMN-08 : This is a seat the GOP is supposed to flip and create a small buffer against any other losses . Republican Pete Stauber is matched up with Democrat Joe Radinovich .\nThe last 10 states start closing polls at 10 p.m. Eastern . Alaska runs the latest , keeping polls open until at least midnight on the East Coast .

Democratic Sens . Jon Tester of Montana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota are hoping to win in states President Trump took in 2016 .

The other is Georgia\u2019s seventh congressional district, where GOP Rep. Rob Woodall faces a tight race with Democratic challenger Carolyn Bourdeaux.\n\nVirginia: There are several opportunities for House Democrats to pick up seats. Rep.
