With FAIR , Kobach helped write Arizona \u2019 s highly discriminatory immigration law , which required police to demand proof of citizenship from anyone they suspected of being in the country illegally and advised other states , including Alabama , that have passed similar legislation . He also filed suit to prevent Kansas , Nebraska , and California from offering in-state college tuition to the children of undocumented immigrants , and he has defended laws in Nebraska , Texas , and Pennsylvania that would make it illegal to rent to undocumented immigrants .\nIn his 2010 campaign for secretary of state , he promised to stamp out voter fraud .

These had to include many people ( including a 92-year-old woman who appealed her denial ) who for one reason or another didn \u2019 t have passports or birth certificates on hand . Kobach \u2019 s ruling created a weird two-tier system , where Kansans who had national voter registration , which only requires a registrant to swear that he or she is a citizen , could vote in congressional or senate selections , but unless they had a Kansas voter registration , which requires proof of citizenship , could not vote in a state or local race .\nThere are , of course , anti-immigration nuts who don \u2019 t care about any other issues or about politics in general , but Kobach is also an avid partisan who was chairman of the Kansas Republican Party . His rulings on voter registration appear equally designed to help Republicans and to eliminate an alien presence in American life . His attempt to keep Taylor on the ballot\u2014and his subsequent threat to force the Democrats to replace him on the ballot\u2014reflects a diehard partisanship that shows little concern for legal niceties . In 2012 , he even justified an attempt to keep Obama off the Kansas ballot on the grounds he had not proved his citizenship . And he is also a hardline rightwinger on the welfare state ( he wants to remove Kansas entirely from the purview of the Affordable Care Act ) and on guns , championing a law that has made guns produced in Kansas not subject to federal regulation .
