Besides Indiana , 19 states have adopted such laws , but the laws in the other states apply to disputes between individuals and the government ; Indiana \u2019 s law also applies to disputes between private citizens .\nThe Supreme Court helped the cause of Christian conservatives with its 2014 Hobby Lobby decision , which held that family-owned corporations may invoke the federal religious-freedom law in refusing to comply with a law requiring employer-paid health plans to cover contraception benefits . The wording in Indiana \u2019 s religious-freedom law tracks that ruling in protecting corporations .\nIf Mr. Pence is genuinely concerned about why people may be misunderstanding the law , he could start by looking in the mirror . Under persistent questioning on ABC News \u2019 s \u201c This Week \u201d on Sunday morning , Mr. Pence insisted that the law \u201c is not about discrimination , \u201d but about \u201c empowering people . \u201d\nThat claim is impossible to square with his refusal to consider a statewide law protecting gays and lesbians from discrimination ( about a dozen Indiana cities , including most of the largest ones , already have such laws ) .
