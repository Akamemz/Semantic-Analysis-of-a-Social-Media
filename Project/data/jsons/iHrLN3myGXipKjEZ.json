The group also has local chapters that are planning marches in cities around the country this year , though other local marches are not affiliated with Women \u2019 s March Inc .\nThe controversy has contributed to the cancellation of at least one city march , and a number of progressive groups , including the Southern Poverty Law Center , have dropped their partnerships with the Women \u2019 s March , according to the Jewish News Syndicate .\nMeanwhile , the Democratic National Committee appears to have been removed from a list of partners on the Women \u2019 s March website .\nWomen \u2019 s March Inc. co-chairs Tamika Mallory and Bob Bland denied allegations of anti-Semitism in an appearance on The View on Monday . Asked by co-host Meghan McCain why she would publicly associate with Farrakhan , given his anti-Semitic remarks , Mallory said , \u201c I don \u2019 t agree with many of Minister Farrakhan \u2019 s statements . \u201d\nShe also resisted calls to step down . \u201c I am willing to lead until my term at Women \u2019 s March is up , \u201d she said .\n\u201c Women \u2019 s March exists to fight all forms of oppression and bigotry , including anti-Semitism , misogyny , homophobia , transphobia , racism , white supremacy , ableism , xenophobia , Islamophobia , classism , and ageism , \u201d Women \u2019 s March Inc. said in a statement to \u2588\u2588\u2588 , in response to a question about groups dropping partnerships . \u201c That work continues with the release of our Women \u2019 s Agenda and lobby day this week in Washington , and our anniversary Marches happening all over the country this Saturday . \u201d\nNo matter what happens at those marches , the influence of the Women \u2019 s March on American feminism \u2014 and on the left more broadly \u2014 is undeniable .

But the impact of the Women \u2019 s March as a broader movement on American politics endures .\nThe controversies have caused some to distance themselves from the Women \u2019 s March\nWomen \u2019 s March Inc. is no stranger to controversy , having weathered debates over representation of women of color and the inclusion ( or exclusion ) of a variety of groups from its official platform . But criticism of the group intensified in March 2018 when Mallory attended a Nation of Islam event at which Farrakhan made anti-Semitic remarks . In November , as controversy grew over the issue , Teresa Shook , whose 2016 Facebook post kicked off the first march , called on Mallory and the other co-chairs of Women \u2019 s March Inc. to step down .\nThen in December , Leah McSweeney and Jacob Siegel at Tablet reported that , according to others involved in planning the march , Mallory and fellow Women \u2019 s March Inc. co-chair Carmen Perez had made anti-Semitic comments themselves . At a meeting to plan the first Women \u2019 s March , Mallory and Perez \u201c asserted that Jewish people bore a special collective responsibility as exploiters of black and brown people , \u201d sources told Tablet .\nMallory and the Women \u2019 s March have denied these allegations . But the Tablet report , as well as Mallory \u2019 s association with Farrakhan , has led some groups to drop their affiliation with Women \u2019 s March Inc .\nIn December , the Washington state chapter of the Women \u2019 s March announced that it would disband and affiliate with a different progressive group , Smart Politics . Organizers in Spokane , Washington , still plan to hold a march .\nMeanwhile , earlier this month , organizers of the New Orleans Women \u2019 s March announced they were canceling this Saturday \u2019 s event .\n\u201c Many of the sister marches have asked the leaders of Women \u2019 s March Inc. to resign but as of today , they have yet to do so , \u201d said the National Organization for Women \u2019 s Baton Rouge chapter , which organized the New Orleans march . \u201c The controversy is dampening efforts of sister marches to fundraise , enlist involvement , [ and ] find sponsors , and attendee numbers have drastically declined this year . New Orleans is no exception . \u201d\nA number of progressive organizations , from the SPLC to Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense , have dropped their affiliations with Women \u2019 s March Inc. over concerns about anti-Semitism , according to the Jewish News Syndicate .\n\u201c Moms Demand Action isn \u2019 t an official sponsor of the Women \u2019 s March , but plenty of chapters have chosen to participate in the locally organized events , \u201d Taylor Maxwell , a spokesperson for Moms Demand Action , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 .

According to the Washington Post , since anti-Semitism charges were first leveled at the organization , it has added three Jewish women to its steering committee and updated its platform to include a message of support for Jewish women .\nIt remains to be seen whether this will be enough to convince those concerned about the anti-Semitism allegations to turn out to march on Saturday . Sociology professor Dana R. Fisher , who studies protest movements , told the Post that turnout in Washington , DC , will probably number in the tens of thousands , far fewer than the estimated 470,000 people who attended the first Women \u2019 s March following the inauguration of President Trump in 2017 .\nBut those who marched in 2017 may also be engaging in other forms of activism . Instead of a march on Saturday , Women \u2019 s March Chicago has organized Operation Activation , which encourages women and their allies to participate in community actions like neighborhood cleanups and postcard-writing campaigns advocating for progressive legislation . The decision to hold a day of action instead of a march wasn \u2019 t inspired by controversy around Women \u2019 s March Inc. , according to a Women \u2019 s March Chicago fact sheet provided to \u2588\u2588\u2588 . Rather , the Chicago group chose to hold a march in October 2018 to mobilize voters for the midterm elections , and decided not to host two marches back to back . The group plans to march again in 2020 .\nAnd in addition to the march on Saturday , Women \u2019 s March Inc. is releasing a federal policy platform called the Women \u2019 s Agenda and organizing a day of lobbying on Capitol Hill on Friday in support of Medicare-for-all .\nThrough their platform , their marches , and their Women \u2019 s Convention in October 2017 in Detroit , the Women \u2019 s March organizers changed the mainstream conversation around feminism and left-wing politics in America , prompting a wider swath of women than ever before to think about women \u2019 s rights as part of a larger set of civil rights , including racial and economic justice .\nThat conversation will no doubt continue at marches on Saturday . But it will also continue at community actions and other events throughout the year \u2014 and in the halls of Congress , where more women than ever before now have the opportunity to craft legislation that affects all Americans .\nWhatever happens in the streets on Saturday , the legacy of the women who marched all over the world in 2017 will persist for a long time to come .",
