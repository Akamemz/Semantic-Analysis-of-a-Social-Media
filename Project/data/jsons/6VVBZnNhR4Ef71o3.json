    "content": "President Obama has spent the past few days in the Philippines and Malaysia , working to strengthen alliances in Asia and help build the multilateral organizations that are writing the rules in that dynamic part of the world .\nAt a time when the American public is focused on national security and the Middle East , it might be surprising for the President to be thinking so much about trade across the Pacific . But the reality is that trade is one of our most crucial ways to guarantee security -- and the Pacific Rim trade deal Congress is now considering will be a linchpin of the effort .\nThe economic centerpiece to America \u2019 s Asia policy is the Trans Pacific Partnership , a comprehensive trade and investment pact among 12 countries representing 40 percent of the global GDP and 30 percent of global trade .
