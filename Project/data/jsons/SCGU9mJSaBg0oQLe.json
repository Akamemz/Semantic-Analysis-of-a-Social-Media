Do n't get discouraged . It 's worth the struggle .\nSounding like a motivational speaker , President Barack Obama asked young supporters on Wednesday to encourage their peers to sign up for health coverage under his embattled reforms known both affectionately and derisively as Obamacare .\nAt a White House Youth Summit , Obama used the opportunity to rally a key demographic for the success of the 2010 Affordable Care Act now that the system 's problem-plagued website appeared to working smoothly for most users .\nHe compared the never-ending political fight over the health care reforms to struggles that surrounded social progress milestones of the past century .\n`` I hope you have n't been discouraged by how hard it 's been because stuff that 's worth it is always hard , '' Obama said . `` The civil rights movement was hard . Getting women the right to vote -- that was hard . Making sure that workers had the right to organize -- that was hard . It 's never been easy for us to change how we do business in this country . ''\nJoking he had more gray hair because of relentless attacks on the reforms led by conservative Republicans , Obama added it was worth it and told the laughing summit participants to `` be persistent '' in spreading information about new benefits and helping others enroll .\nJUST WATCHED Obama kicks off Obamacare PR offensive Replay More Videos ...
