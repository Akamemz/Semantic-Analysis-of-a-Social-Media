    "content": "PHILADELPHIA \u2014 The leader of the world 's 1.2 billion Catholics brought his message of religious freedom and compassionate immigration to historic Independence Hall on Saturday , speaking in his native Spanish to a wildly receptive audience .\nMore than 40,000 people gathered to hear Pope Francis speak at the site where colonists declared their freedom from British rule .\n`` Society is weakened wherever and whenever injustice prevails , '' he told the crowd to applause . He said recent immigrants to the U.S. should not be discouraged by the challenges they face .\n`` I ask you not to forget that like those who came before you , you bring many gifts to this great nation , '' he said . The pope concluded by leading the crowd , in English , in the Lord 's Prayer .\n`` God bless you all , '' he said before stepping away from the podium .\nMinutes before Francis spoke , he paused multiple times to bless several babies along Market Street . The crowd , which had gathered hours before the speech , was enthusiastic all day .\nFrancis also blessed a `` cruz de los encuentros , '' a 5-foot-tall cross symbolizing the journey of faith of Latino Catholics . He spoke from the same lectern that was used by Abraham Lincoln to deliver the Gettysburg Address .\nOmar Navarro , 34 , from Clifton , N.J. , was excited to get a glimpse of the pope . Navarro said the pontiff 's message sharply contrasts with much of the rhetoric coming from Donald Trump , the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination .\n`` The pope with not too many words will touch so many people , '' said Navarro , who is Mexican . `` Donald Trump was trying to divide immigrants from the rest of the community , but the pope is going to put them together . ''\n`` I 'm hopeful that people will listen to Pope Francis and hear what he has to say about the dignity of people , immigrant or not , and reflect on that , '' said Josefa Lopez , 63 , an Argentinean immigrant who lives in West Orange , N.J. `` I think his words can change minds . ''\nEarlier Saturday , Francis arrived at Philadelphia International Airport to musical selections ranging from Ode to Joy to the theme from the movie Rocky .
