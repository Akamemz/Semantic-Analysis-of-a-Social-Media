With the national debt at $ 16.1 trillion and growing , it 's not realistic to exempt such a large portion of taxpayers from making a greater contribution , budget experts say .\nIf they do , they 'll have to lean almost exclusively on the top 2 % , who reported adjusted gross income over $ 250,000 . That group paid 46 % of income taxes in 2010 .\nSuch a limited proposition will be hard to pull off .\nRomney : He wants to cut everyone 's tax rates by 20 % , which is a key feature of his $ 5 trillion tax reform plan . Romney also says he will pay for his plan through a combination of economic growth and curbs on tax breaks that high-income filers enjoy .\nAt the same time , he promises to offer tax relief to the middle class and to not raise investment tax rates on high-income households , despite the fact that investment tax rates are among the most costly tax breaks to federal coffers .\nAlso topping Romney 's fiscal to-do list : balance the budget in eight years . He would do so by cutting spending , but spare defense , which accounts for about 20 % of the federal budget . Indeed , he would increase defense spending by roughly $ 1.34 trillion over a decade relative to the Congressional Budget Office 's projections of defense spending , and pay for the increase with yet more cuts to other parts of the budget . ( See correction below . )\nRomney 's proposals to reform Medicare and Social Security potentially could help in this effort . But savings from his proposals are unlikely to kick in quickly since he has said he would protect those near retirement from any changes .\nBottom line : Romney is promising to pay for $ 6.34 trillion of new tax cuts and spending increases , then eliminate deficits within a decade . And he 's promising to do that while increasing defense spending and giving tax relief to the middle class . If he somehow manages to avoid raising taxes on them , the steep spending cuts he has called for are likely to hurt programs they rely on .\nObama : For the president , tax cuts are the biggest reason why his budget proposal would add to deficits in the next decade .\nObama wants to spare 98 % of Americans from any tax increases by extending their Bush-era tax cuts . He also wants to make permanent expanded tax breaks for low- and middle-income Americans .\nTo help pay for that , Obama explicitly favors raising taxes on the top 2 % . He wants to raise the top two income tax rates , as well as investment tax rates paid by high-income households . In addition , he would limit the value of their itemized deductions and other tax breaks .\nBut doing so only offsets $ 523 billion of his roughly $ 3 trillion in individual tax cuts , according to CBO estimates .\nIn terms of tax reform , he wants the `` Buffett Rule '' to replace the Alternative Minimum Tax . The rule would require those making more than $ 1 million to pay a minimum of 30 % of their income in income taxes . Problem is , such a rule wo n't raise nearly the revenue that the AMT can .\nIndeed , the broad problem with relying exclusively on the top 2 % is that there are n't enough people at that level to pay for everything the country wants to do , at least not in an economically smart way . And their incomes tend to be volatile , which means they can be an unreliable revenue source , especially when the economy is n't booming .\nCorrection : An earlier version of this article stated that Romney would increase defense spending by $ 2 trillion ; that is the estimated increase relative to Obama 's proposals .",
