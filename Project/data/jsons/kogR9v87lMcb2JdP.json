    "content": "President Obama , in the first of potentially many executive actions tied to his State of the Union address , will unilaterally increase the minimum wage for workers under new federal contracts to $ 10.10 an hour , from $ 7.25 , in an effort to build momentum for a minimum wage hike for all Americans .\nThe executive order , which had been pushed by progressive Democratic lawmakers , applies to all contractors performing services for the federal government and would affect more than 2 million employees , according to an administration official .\nThe president will then use Tuesday night 's address to press Congress to pass a Democratic plan to increase the overall federal wage to $ 10.10 over three years , then indexing it to inflation , while also raising the minimum wage for tipped workers , the official said .\nCritics of the minimum wage push claim that raising the rate could have an adverse effect , discouraging businesses from hiring more workers at a time when the government is trying to spur job growth .\n`` The minimum wage is mostly an entry level wage for young people , '' Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell told `` Fox News Sunday .
