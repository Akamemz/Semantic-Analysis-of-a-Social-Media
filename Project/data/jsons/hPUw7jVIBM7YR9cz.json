This is how long the line is . pic.twitter.com/bilpnGsrzl \u2014 Saahil Desai ( @ Saahil_Desai ) November 6 , 2016\nBut as bad as this looks , Ohioans and North Carolinians are lucky in one way : At least they can vote early . In 13 states , you either need an excuse to vote early \u2014 such as a business trip conflicting with Election Day \u2014 or you simply can \u2019 t vote early at all .\nThis is just one of the many ways America \u2019 s voting system is antiquated . From holding Election Day on a Tuesday to requiring that people file extra paperwork just to register to vote , there is a lot in American elections that feels outdated .\nIt doesn \u2019 t have to be this way . Here are nine changes that could make voting easier or otherwise better on Election Day or before :\nChange Election Day : Election Day was officially set in 1845 , back when a Tuesday in early November was a convenient time for farmers to vote . Since then , a lot has changed \u2014 most importantly , Tuesday is now in the middle of the workweek for the typical 9-to-5 employee . Changing Election Day to a weekend or even extending it to an entire week could help make voting easier for people . Make Election Day a holiday : Short of actually changing Election Day , the US could make Election Day a national holiday so it doesn \u2019 t conflict with work responsibilities . The research is mixed on whether this and other changes to Election Day would affect voter turnout , but it \u2019 s worth considering . Allow or expand early voting : 34 states already allow no-excuse early voting , although some limit it to one or two weeks , weekdays , and , worse , 9-to-5 office hours . But a few states have proven that it \u2019 s possible to offer much more expansive voting windows \u2014 Minnesota , for example , allows early voting 46 days before Election Day . Others , like Maine and Iowa , allow voting as soon as ballots are available \u2014 which can be as early as up to 45 days before Election Day . The research is conflicted on whether this would increase voter turnout , but it would at least open up more chances for people to vote . Move some or all voting to mail : Colorado , Oregon , and Washington only vote by mail , setting up systems that let people pick up or print out ballots and simply mail them in to their local voting office . There are some concerns to only allowing mail-in voting , including ballots getting lost in the mail and potentially making it easier for family members or peers to coerce a person into voting a certain way . But mail-in voting is one way that states can potentially expand voting time on the cheap , since they no longer need to hire staff to supervise polling booths . Automatically register people to vote , or register everyone : To this day , all but one state ( North Dakota ) require people to register to vote . This just adds another hurdle to voting . States could take steps to automatically register people to vote , as Oregon did . Or maybe they could do away with registration , like North Dakota has \u2014 allowing people to instead prove on Election Day that they live in the state with a state-issued ID or other identification documents . Relax strict voter ID laws : Over the past few years , more states have adopted strict laws that limit what IDs someone needs to show on Election Day to vote . For example , they might allow a government-issued photo ID as proof to vote , but ban a student ID or bank statement . This is supposedly to combat voter impersonation , but this kind of voter fraud is very rare anyway \u2014 between 2000 and 2014 , there were only 35 credible allegations of voter impersonation , while more than 1 billion ballots were cast . So maybe these laws can be relaxed to allow more forms of ID or not require an ID at all . Make voting easier for people with disabilities : People with disabilities can face huge challenges when they head to the voting booth , from difficulty reading a ballot to a lack of wheelchair-accessible ramps . According to a 2013 study by Rutgers University associate professor Lisa Schur , 3 million more people would turn out to vote if Americans with disabilities voted at the same rate as otherwise similar people without disabilities . But Schur reported that previous research has found that only 27 percent of polling places in 2008 posed no potential impediments to people with disabilities . ( Liz Plank made a great video for \u2588\u2588\u2588 covering all of these issues . ) Make voting compulsory : This wouldn \u2019 t necessarily make voting easier , but it could drive a lot more people to the polls . As Dylan Matthews wrote for \u2588\u2588\u2588 , making voting compulsory is one of the few ideas that really is proven to increase voter turnout . And that would make American government more representative of all the people that it \u2019 s supposed to work for . Online voting : This would be the most convenient form of voting possible for anyone with a computer , tablet , or phone connected to the internet . But there are enormous security risks : At a time when hackers are managing to break into all sorts of places \u2014 and even shutting down the internet for huge swaths of the country \u2014 it \u2019 s extremely risky . Before online voting is ever implemented , these risks will need to be figured out . ( And maybe it \u2019 ll never be possible \u2014 Suzanne Mello-Stark argued for \u2588\u2588\u2588 that elections will likely continue to need a paper trail to remain credible . )\nBeyond possibly improving the voting experience , these changes could help address a serious problem : The US has relatively low voter turnout for a wealthy nation \u2014 meaning much of the population isn \u2019 t having its voice heard . About 53.6 percent of the US voting-age population turned out to vote in 2012 , according to the Pew Research Center . Other countries reported much higher shares of their voting-age population turning out to vote in recent elections : 87.2 percent in Belgium , 66 percent in Germany , and 61.1 percent in the UK .\nSome of the difference is explained by differences in policies . Unlike most wealthy countries , the US doesn \u2019 t automatically register voters ( as Germany and Sweden do ) , and it doesn \u2019 t seek them out aggressively to push them to register ( as the UK does ) . And the US definitely doesn \u2019 t go as far as Belgium or Australia , which make voting compulsory .\nAll of that , of course , falls on top of more typical voting issues , such as a lack of access to transportation to get to a polling place on Election Day or being unable to take time away from work or family life to vote .\nThe policy changes listed above could alleviate these issues . Some of them , particularly the expansion of voting days , cost more money . It \u2019 s going to be up to lawmakers and their constituents in different jurisdictions to decide what the right balance of costs and access to voting is .\nBut whatever they decide , it \u2019 s clear that voting doesn \u2019 t have to be as difficult as it is today .",
