So much so , they warn , that the system could begin to resemble Medicaid , the health care program for low-income Americans .\n`` Indeed , I think this will eventually be like Medicaid , '' said Merrill Matthews , director of the Council for Affordable Health Insurance .\nMatthews said the only way many insurers are going to be able to control costs is by `` simply clamping down on the amount they are willing to pay . ''\nJust as with Medicaid , analysts warn that if payments get too low , many doctors might start refusing to see patients . That will leave more and more patients jockeying to see fewer and fewer doctors .\nThey emphasize , then , that having health insurance wo n't necessarily translate into access to health care .\n`` About half of the physicians in many communities refuse to take Medicaid patients because the payment system is just too low , '' said James Capretta , of the Ethics and Public Policy Center .\nDoug Holtz-Eakin , former director of the Congressional Budget Office , suggested some of the plans on the exchanges are going in the same direction .\n`` If you look at something where you get a dollar by treating a private payer , you get about 70 cents out of Medicare for that same treatment , you get about 55 cents out of Medicaid for that , '' he said .\nHe added : `` You know , ObamCare started to look like Medicaid of the future , and in the Medicaid in the present , you can have the insurance but a doctor wo n't see you . ''\nBy the end of March , the Obama administration hopes to increase the number of people on Medicaid by 9 million , and the number in private plans by 7 million . New Medicaid enrollments so far have far outpaced enrollments in private plans on the exchanges .\nBut since Medicaid patients already have access to relatively few doctors , expanding that population while opening the door to lower payments for private insurance raises the prospect of rationing , as too many people chase too few doctors .\n`` These networks are going to be jammed with people , '' Robert Laszewski , president of Health Policy and Strategy Associates , said . `` Far more than they 're treating now , and I do n't doubt that we 're going to have problems with access to these doctors .
