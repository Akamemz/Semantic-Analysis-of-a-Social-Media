Saxby Chambliss and Lindsey Graham to the growing list , along with Reps. Peter King , Steve LaTourette and Scott Rigell .\nChambliss kicked off the most recent outbreak of common sense by telling a Georgia TV station , `` I care more about my country than I do about a 20-year-old pledge . '' He added , `` If we do it ( Norquist 's ) way , then we 'll continue in debt . ''\nOn ABC 's `` This Week , '' Graham doubled down by saying , `` I agree with Grover , we should n't raise rates , but I think Grover is wrong when it comes to we ca n't cap deductions and buy down debt . ... I will violate the pledge , long story short , for the good of the country , only if Democrats will do entitlement reform . ''\nKing agreed with Chambliss on NBC 's `` Meet the Press , '' saying , `` A pledge you signed 20 years ago , 18 years ago , is for that Congress . ... For instance , if I were in Congress in 1941 , I would have signed a declaration of war against Japan . I 'm not going to attack Japan today . The world has changed , and the economic situation is different . ''\nAnd on CNN last weekend , LaTourette and Rigell told Ali Velshi that they thought the straitjacket pledge was an impediment to dealing with the deficit and the debt .\nThis post-election outbreak of pragmatism is welcome and needed . These senators and congressmen are profiles in courage for speaking out against the stranglehold that one self-appointed activist and lobbyist has had on bipartisan governing .\nNorquist , who leads the conservative activist group Americans for Tax Reform , is both a colorful character and committed ideologue , infamous for sound bites like this : `` I do n't want to abolish government . I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub . ''\nThe signature item for Americans for Tax Reform is a pledge that commits signers to oppose any tax increases at all , for all time -- not just tax rate increases , but any increases in tax revenue .\nThis distinction makes a real difference in the current deficit and debt deal negotiations . Going back to the Bowles-Simpson Commission , the obvious common ground for negotiations has been for Democrats to compromise on spending cuts and entitlement reform and Republicans to compromise on increased tax revenue . This can be done -- as the Bowles-Simpson Commission demonstrated -- by potentially even lowering some tax rates but closing loopholes to raise revenue . This is what 's known as a win-win .\nThe biggest stumbling block for tea party conservatives has been Norquist , who says any new revenue violates the pledge and promises to invite a primary challenge to any member of Congress who puts revenues on the table . Given the number of safe seats carved up in the rigged system of redistricting , a primary challenge from the wings is what most members of Congress fear most . The result is gridlock : an inability to reason together and make a long-term deal for the good of the country .\nIt is an ironic problem in some ways : Tea party congressmen rose to power on a promise to deal with deficits and debt .
