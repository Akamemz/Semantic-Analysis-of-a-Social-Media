No , seriously .\n\u2022 Cancer patient \u2019 s ObamaCare heartbreak goes big in Senate ad\nFor a second straight week , Democrats find themselves explaining why it \u2019 s a good thing for fewer Americans to be employed . Last week , it was a Congressional Budget Office report that said millions would leave the U.S. workforce in order to obtain ObamaCare benefits . This week , the CBO says that the centerpiece of the Obama Democrats midterm campaign pitch , a call to increase the federal minimum wage by 40 percent , will cost as many as 1 million jobs . Democrats aren \u2019 t much disputing the finding from the nonpartisan green-eyeshade brigade , but are instead trying to explain why less work is a good thing . Again .

Unable to continue to effectively blame Republican practices from the previous decade for the unhappy condition of the economy or health sector , Democrats have decided to get proactive . Big mistake . Unfortunately , what Democrats propose fits too neatly into Republican talking points honed over the last four years , namely that President Obama \u2019 s policies mean big government and more dependency . While Dems will be torturing the forecast tables of economic reports to explain why lost insurance , higher premiums , lost jobs and more debt are necessary for building a sustainable economy , Republicans will simply say \u201c Obama isn \u2019 t working . \u201d\n[ A Pennsylvania small-business association says its members are getting walloped by ObamaCare insurance cost increases , with hikes ranging from 49 percent to almost 300 percent . ]\nDaily Caller : \u201c Obamacare \u2019 s medical device tax has already created a job loss of 33,000 in the medical device industry and 132,000 more job losses are expected , according to a new report from the industry trade group the Advanced Medical Technology Association ( AdvaMed ) ... \u201d\n[ LAT shares how one high-end California restaurant is adding a 3 percent fee to customer \u2019 s bills to pay for its employee \u2019 s insurance under ObamaCare ]\nDaily Caller : \u201c The fourth Georgia hospital in two years is closing its doors due to severe financial difficulties caused by Obamacare \u2019 s payment cuts for emergency services .

Treasury \u2019 s inspector general for tax administration found that the expenses for nine IRS executives \u2014 out of 31 whose travel was examined \u2014 were wrongly deemed to be nontaxable , on average reimbursements of $ 51,420\u2026 The tax administration inspector general looked into the matter after finding last year that IRS executives spent $ 9.5 million in travel expenses in 2011 and 2012 , with several claiming more than $ 100,000 a year . The inspector general released that report just weeks after it outlined the extra scrutiny the agency gave to Tea Party groups . \u201d\nDecadent chic - Peggy Noonan considers Our Decadent Elites : \u201c \u2018 House of Cards \u2019 very famously does nothing to enhance Washington \u2019 s reputation . It reinforces the idea that the capital has no room for clean people . The earnest , the diligent , the idealistic , they have no place there . Why would powerful members of Congress align themselves with this message ? Why do they become part of it ? I guess they think they \u2019 re showing they \u2019 re in on the joke and hip to the culture . I guess they think they \u2019 re impressing people with their surprising groovelocity . Or maybe they \u2019 re just stupid . \u201d\n\u201c International estimates now have the number of dead in the three-year Syrian civil war at more than 150,000 with no end in sight . Much was made of a Russian-brokered deal last year to end the fighting and eliminate the country \u2019 s chemical weapons arsenal . But the Syrian government has missed deadline after deadline for removing chemical weapons stockpiles and components . Now , according to the Washington Post , \u201c Syria \u2019 s rebels are launching a new push to persuade the Obama administration to provide them with advanced weapons. \u201d Rebels who felt abandoned by the administration the first time around are giving it another shot . We \u2019 ll see what the reception is this time . It 's doubtful that President Obama is ready to seriously consider another strike option ... But stranger things have happened. \u201d \u2013 Bret Baier\nEconomist Thomas Sowell considers the lessons of the Afghan war : \u201c F.A . Hayek said , \u2018 We shall not grow wiser until we learn that much that we have done was very foolish. \u2019 Nothing is more foolish \u2013 and immoral \u2013 than sending men into battle to risk their lives winning victories that are later lost by politicians for political reasons . \u201d\nObama Job Approval : Approve \u2013 43.2 percent//Disapprove \u2013 52.8 percent\nDirection of Country : Right Direction \u2013 29.6 percent//Wrong Track \u2013 63.6 percent\nGeneric Congressional Ballot : Democrats \u2013 41.7 percent// Republicans 41.7 percent\n\u201c The Democratic Party is not going to lose the Senate \u201d \u2014White House Press Secretary Jay Carney during Tuesday \u2019 s press briefing\nAmericans for Prosperity is putting $ 750,000 behind a heart-wrenching ad that uses the story of a Michigan leukemia patient who lost her health policy because of ObamaCare . The spot targets Democratic Senate candidate Rep. Gary Peters , D-Mich. , for his continued support of ObamaCare . From the group : \u201c The ad shares the story of Julie Boonstra , who was diagnosed with leukemia five years ago . Despite the President \u2019 s promises that \u201c if you like your health care plan , you can keep it , \u201d Julie \u2019 s existing health insurance was cancelled due to ObamaCare . Now , under her new health care plan , Julie \u2019 s out-of-pocket expenses are so high that she struggles to afford the medication she needs to treat her illness . \u201d\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee is using the latest ObamaCare enrollment figures to take vulnerable Democrats to task over more cancellations than signups under the troubled health law . The NRSC will be hitting Sens . Kay Hagan , D-N.C. , Mary Landrieu , D-La. , Jeff Merkley , D-Oreg. , Jeanne Shaheen , D-N.H. , Mark Udall , D-Colo. , and Rep. Gary Peters , D-Mich. From the group \u2019 s attack on Udall , \u201c As of February 1st , 68,454 Coloradans have signed up for ObamaCare . However , 335,484 Coloradans received cancellation notices - about 86,000 more than previously known\u2026No matter how hard Mark Udall tries to convince voters otherwise , he knew many would lose health insurance plans and doctors that they liked as they are forced into the ObamaCare exchanges .

Mark Pryor ( D-Ark . ) , Mary Landrieu ( D-La . ) and Mark Begich ( D-Ak . ) \u2026 The GOP has sought to make cuts to Medicare Advantage an election-year issue\u2026 ObamaCare enacted $ 200 billion in cuts to Medicare Advantage over 10 years . The administration is expected to announce 2015 rates for the alternative to government health insurance later this week . Insurers have mounted an intense lobbying campaign to head off expected cuts to the popular program . The issue is particularly sensitive during an election year as both parties court senior voters , who make up a disproportionate percentage of the voting population . \u201d\nA big relief for North Carolina GOP Senate frontrunner state House Speaker Thom Tillis as his primary pursuer suffers a huge setback in court .

They \u2019 re going to lose all of their income , and they \u2019 re going to lose the first step on the ladder into employment , which is the hope for the future . So it \u2019 s a high price .

Treasury\u2019s inspector general for tax administration found that the expenses for nine IRS executives \u2014 out of 31 whose travel was examined \u2014 were wrongly deemed to be nontaxable, on average reimbursements of $51,420\u2026 The tax administration inspector general looked into the matter after finding last year that IRS executives spent $9.5 million in travel expenses in 2011 and 2012, with several claiming more than $100,000 a year. The inspector general released that report just weeks after it outlined the extra scrutiny the agency gave to Tea Party groups.\u201d\n\nDecadent chic - Peggy Noonan considers Our Decadent Elites: \u201c\u2018House of Cards\u2019 very famously does nothing to enhance Washington\u2019s reputation. It reinforces the idea that the capital has no room for clean people. The earnest, the diligent, the idealistic, they have no place there. Why would powerful members of Congress align themselves with this message? Why do they become part of it? I guess they think they\u2019re showing they\u2019re in on the joke and hip to the culture. I guess they think they\u2019re impressing people with their surprising groovelocity. Or maybe they\u2019re just stupid.\u201d\n\nBAIER TRACKS: WHAT WILL BECOME OF SYRIA?\n\n\u201cInternational estimates now have the number of dead in the three-year Syrian civil war at more than 150,000 with no end in sight. Much was made of a Russian-brokered deal last year to end the fighting and eliminate the country\u2019s chemical weapons arsenal. But the Syrian government has missed deadline after deadline for removing chemical weapons stockpiles and components. Now, according to the Washington Post, \u201cSyria\u2019s rebels are launching a new push to persuade the Obama administration to provide them with advanced weapons.\u201d Rebels who felt abandoned by the administration the first time around are giving it another shot.

The spot targets Democratic Senate candidate Rep. Gary Peters, D-Mich., for his continued support of ObamaCare. From the group: \u201cThe ad shares the story of Julie Boonstra, who was diagnosed with leukemia five years ago. Despite the President\u2019s promises that \u201cif you like your health care plan, you can keep it,\u201d Julie\u2019s existing health insurance was cancelled due to ObamaCare. Now, under her new health care plan, Julie\u2019s out-of-pocket expenses are so high that she struggles to afford the medication she needs to treat her illness.\u201d\n\nNRSC NAILS DEMS OVER OBAMACARE CANCELLATIONS\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee is using the latest ObamaCare enrollment figures to take vulnerable Democrats to task over more cancellations than signups under the troubled health law. The NRSC will be hitting Sens. Kay Hagan, D-N.C., Mary Landrieu, D-La., Jeff Merkley, D-Oreg., Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., Mark Udall, D-Colo., and Rep. Gary Peters, D-Mich. From the group\u2019s attack on Udall, \u201cAs of February 1st, 68,454 Coloradans have signed up for ObamaCare. However, 335,484 Coloradans received cancellation notices - about 86,000 more than previously known\u2026No matter how hard Mark Udall tries to convince voters otherwise, he knew many would lose health insurance plans and doctors that they liked as they are forced into the ObamaCare exchanges.

The letter was signed by party heavyweights, including Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), as well as vulnerable Democrats facing reelection, such as Sens. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.), Mary Landrieu (D-La.) and Mark Begich (D-Ak.)\u2026 The GOP has sought to make cuts to Medicare Advantage an election-year issue\u2026 ObamaCare enacted $200 billion in cuts to Medicare Advantage over 10 years. The administration is expected to announce 2015 rates for the alternative to government health insurance later this week. Insurers have mounted an intense lobbying campaign to head off expected cuts to the popular program. The issue is particularly sensitive during an election year as both parties court senior voters, who make up a disproportionate percentage of the voting population.\u201d\n\nTEA PARTY SENATE HOPEFUL SUFFERS LEGAL SETBACK\n\nA big relief for North Carolina GOP Senate frontrunner state House Speaker Thom Tillis as his primary pursuer suffers a huge setback in court. WRAL: \u201cA Wake County [North Carolina] jury found Tuesday that Republican U.S. Senate candidate Dr. Greg Brannon misled investors in a technology start-up. As a result of the civil judgment, Brannon will be personally liable for repaying $250,000. If the judgment is upheld on appeal, he will also have to pay 8 percent interest from the time each of the aggrieved investors wrote their checks and could be required to pay their attorneys\u2019 fees in the case\u2026 The judgment comes less than three months before Republican voters will make their selection in the May primary.

Democratic groups have spent nearly $1.5 million doing the opposite\u2026 The biggest spenders on the GOP side have been the National Republican Congressional Committee ($1.3 million), the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ($800,000) and American Action Network ($439,000).

IT\u2019S ARTISTIC NUDITY!\n\nWhen Judy Cox, a mom shopping with her teenage son at an Orem, Utah mall happened upon PacSun\u2019s window display of \u201cVisual\u201d T-shirts (really, really visual) , she was incensed. She asked that the shirts, which feature lingerie-clad women in provocative poses, be removed from the window. \u201cI had a conversation with the store manager,\u201d Cox told the Provo Daily Herald. \u201cShe said she did refuse to put the accompanying banner up with the display because it was much worse, but that she couldn\u2019t take down the T-shirts without talking to her corporate office, but the promo was over Wednesday anyway.\u2019 Cox had a solution: she purchased all the shirts, including the displays from the store.

They\u2019re going to lose all of their income, and they\u2019re going to lose the first step on the ladder into employment, which is the hope for the future. So it\u2019s a high price. You can make your choice, but there isn\u2019t a free lunch. They are running ads saying give America a raise, as if it\u2019s no cost. It is a cost, and it\u2019s other low income people who will be the ones who pay it.\u201d \u2013 Charles Krauthammer on \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier.\u201d\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
