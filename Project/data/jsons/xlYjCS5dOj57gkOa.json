And those were just the two top headlines in a day that contained a string of dismal news for Donald Trump .\nWill any of this matter ? The president - at least among his base - has appeared politically bulletproof . Bulletproof for now , however , does n't necessarily mean bulletproof forever . At some point , the projectiles - perhaps after the mid-terms , when Republican control of Congress and power to set the political agenda may be blunted - may start finding the mark .\nHere 's a look at just how bad a day this was for the president .\nThe president 's former personal lawyer did n't just stand in court on Tuesday and accuse the president of lying - although he did do that .\nBy saying that Mr Trump - `` individual-1 '' in the plea agreement - directed him to make or oversee payments in 2016 to secure the silence of women poised to accuse the president of having adulterous affairs with them , he effectively implicated the president in the commission of a crime .\nCohen admitted that his payments constituted campaign contributions that either were directed from an illegal corporate source or in excess of allowable amounts for an individual . Both acts carry a five-year maximum prison sentence .\nThe president in the past has denied having any knowledge of the payments . His legal team has since walked that back and asserted that he only had general knowledge after the fact . Now , however , Cohen is saying Mr Trump knew about them from the start .\nAnd it 's not just Cohen 's word against the president 's . In the case of the payment to Karen MacDougal - `` woman-1 '' in the plea agreement - his lawyer has already released an audio recording in which Cohen and then-candidate Mr Trump discussed the issue .\nAdd to this the fact that `` woman-2 '' , adult film actress Stormy Daniels , is now poised to resume her lawsuit against Mr Trump to get out of her non-disclosure agreement brokered by Cohen . A judge put the suit on hold pending the criminal investigation into Cohen , which now appears to be resolved . That suit could turn up more evidence of Mr Trump 's involvement in the illegal $ 130,000 hush-money payment Cohen has now confessed to making to her on the eve of the 2016 election .\nIt 's heavy seas ahead for the president any way you look at it .\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller was under considerable pressure to get a conviction in his case against former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort . Even though the charges did not directly relate to the central thrust of his investigation into possible Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election , it was the first time his team had to face a jury .\nIf they had walked away without a conviction , either through a hung jury or an outright acquittal , the accusations from Trump loyalists that the investigation was a waste of resources and time would have reached a fevered pitch .\nIt was n't an across-the-board victory for Mr Mueller , given that the jury could n't reach a verdict on 10 of the 18 counts , but convictions on tax fraud , failing to disclose foreign bank accounts and bank fraud are points on the board .\nAdd that to the numerous indictments of Russian individuals and companies and plea agreements already reached with Trump campaign officials George Papadopolous , Michael Flynn and Rick Gates , as well as with London lawyer Alex van der Zwaan and computer programmer Richard Pinedo , and the special counsel team is producing a growing list of accomplishments .\nAfter the verdicts were announced , Manafort 's lawyer told the press that his client was `` disappointed '' .
