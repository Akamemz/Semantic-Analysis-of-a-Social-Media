It is hard to believe that a new Republican Senate and emboldened Republican majority in the House are likely to pass a bill that would pass muster with immigration activists .\nJUST WATCHED Obama immigration remarks 'declaration of war ' Replay More Videos ...

They hope he 'll keep his word .\nAfter promising on June 30 to announce the so-called executive actions he would take by summer 's end , the White House delayed the move until after the mid-term election . Activists say they are tired of waiting and are planning a series of rallies , marches , conferences and other events to urge the president not to allow politics to delay action .\n`` Details matter and promises have been made before , '' said Cristina Jimenez , managing director for immigrants ' rights group United We Dream . `` Our campaign to protect our communities will continue until the policy is changed in a way that includes our parents , families and neighbors . ''\nAt risk is not just the president 's standing with the Latino community . Activists say this is an issue for all Democrats -- including potential 2016 candidates -- who some believe have taken Latino voters for granted . In a November poll by Latino Decisions , two-thirds of Latino voters said immigration was either the most important or one of the most important issues driving their vote this year and 60 percent of Latino registered voters who were not planning to vote said the delay in executive action made them less enthusiastic about the president and the Democratic Party . An October survey by Pew Research found that 55 percent of Latino registered voters disapproved of the way the Obama administration has handled the issue of deportations .\n`` The president 's legacy is at stake , '' said Marielena Hincapie , executive director of the National Immigration Law Center .\nHispanic members of Congress who support reform point to the 2 million people deported during the Obama administration as they make their case for swift , expansive action . The president -- who has frequently been called the `` Deporter in Chief '' by immigrant groups -- used a Congressional Hispanic Caucus gala in September to repeat his promise to act before year 's end . He again reiterated that promise at a post election press conference on Wednesday , just moments after incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell warned that doing so would poison the well with the new Republican controlled Congress .\nJUST WATCHED Grassroots immigration anger Replay More Videos ...
