Clapper described the targeting of foreign leaders , including American allies , as a \u201c fundamental \u201d aspect of intelligence gathering , and said neither the CIA nor the National Security Agency can tap into a given leader \u2019 s private communications without White House oversight .\nHis testimony , made during a series of tacit exchanges Tuesday with members of the House Select Committee on Intelligence , came as all sides in Congress have begun seriously examining legislative proposals that would rein in the legal framework surrounding the NSA \u2019 s snooping programs .\nTwo lawmakers introduced a bill Tuesday that would end the agency \u2019 s legal ability to collect and store massive amounts of private , albeit basic , telephone metadata , while a separate Senate proposal would allow the data gathering to continue under new oversight requirements .\nDespite his broad characterizations about the program and the White House \u2019 s knowledge of it , Mr. Clapper sought also to defend Mr. Obama during the intelligence hearing , saying that while the president is briefed \u201c quite frequently \u201d on the scope of surveillance operations , it would be \u201c unrealistic \u201d to think his staff regularly goes over specific details , such as explicitly how or when the intelligence is being gleaned .\nTestifying alongside Army Gen.
