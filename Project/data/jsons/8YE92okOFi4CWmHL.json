    "content": "Even Donald Trump ca n't tell us what `` Obamagate '' is \u2014 other than his newest obsession , designed to distract from his total failure to handle the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting economic catastrophe . But with a news media still and always eager to prove it 's equally tough on `` both sides , '' it 's conceivable that Trump can make Obamagate a thing .\nEager to pretend that the rising death tolls and skyrocketing unemployment rates do n't exist , Trump has pivoted back to what he always planned on doing in the 2020 campaign : Pump out a bunch of conspiracy theories about former Vice President Joe Biden and other leading Democrats . His plan has always been to get the mainstream media to elevate these baseless smears until they dominate the 2020 election cycle , sucking attention away from Trump 's extensive history of failures , scandals , lies and outright crimes .\nAnd why not ? With the help of WikiLeaks and the Russian government \u2014 along with the the spinelessness of FBI Director James Comey \u2014 Trump was able to trick the media into turning a total non-scandal about Hillary Clinton using a private email account to do government business ( something that Trump 's people have done on a much larger scale ) into a five-alarm fire that lost her the election . Even though diligent journalists discovered that Trump had been accused of numerous sexual assaults , had defrauded countless people , and had run multiple businesses into the ground , voters in exit polls still thought `` but her emails '' was the bigger scandal .\nTrump is trying to do it again , repeating the word `` Obamagate '' like a wind-up toy monkey , in hopes that the media will take the hint and start to populate this empty word with details that make it sound like a real scandal . But there 's no scandal there , as Trump himself proved on Monday during an amazing exchange with the Washington Post 's Philip Rucker outside the White House .\nRucker noted that Trump kept saying `` Obamagate '' was `` the biggest political crime in American history , '' and asked Trump directly : `` What crime exactly are you accusing President Obama of committing ? ''\nTrump , shocked that the press was n't doing his dirty work for him ( for once ) , was flabbergasted .\n`` Uh , Obamagate . It 's been going on for a long time , '' Trump said , rambling on without answering the question before concluding , `` Some terrible things happened , and it should never be allowed to happen in our country again , '' without saying what those `` terrible things '' were .\nTrump replied , `` You know what the crime is . The crime is very obvious to everybody . ''\nThis was hilarious but telling . Trump did n't think he needed to come up with an actual accusation , which is understandable . He 'd never had to before ! Insinuation and a pretense of outrage had worked well enough to send the press on a wild goose chase to generate fake scandals in the past . Consider the 2016 campaign , with story after story about Clinton 's `` emails , '' which were always seen as `` damaging , '' even though no one could say what damage her emails had done to whom , or even what alleged crime had been committed . ( The FBI declined to prosecute her , since there was literally nothing to prosecute . )\nIn 2011 , when Trump 's multi-month project of `` just asking questions '' about Barack Obama 's birth certificate generated enough of a media frenzy that Obama was forced to release his long-form Hawaii birth certificate , something no white president has ever felt compelled to do .\nTrump 's assumption that he does n't have to say what `` Obamagate '' is , exactly , for the media to run with it is sadly proving correct . As Greg Sargent of the Washington Post detailed Thursday , journalists , with help from Republican senators , are starting to color in the boxes of `` Obamagate '' with enough detail to make it seem substantive . But even the most cursory of glances makes clear there 's no there there .\nSome in the mainstream press are struggling to circle in on a notion that the Obama administration acted improperly by investigating incoming national security adviser Michael Flynn 's shady conduct toward Russia during the presidential transition . But Obama did n't do anything wrong . Trump did .\nWhat actually happened is simple : Obama issued sanctions against Russian leaders in 2016 for interfering with the election . After that , Flynn , before taking office with the Trump administration , had a private conversation with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak , in which he assured Kislyak not to worry about the sanctions because Trump would get rid of them . Intelligence officials recorded this conversation , since they had Kislyak under surveillance . Obama officials were understandably concerned about what American was making such assurances to Kislyak and wanted to know who it was . That was their legal right and , more importantly , their patriotic duty .\nRepublicans , with great fanfare , have announced their `` discovery '' that Flynn 's identity was shared with a number of top Obama officials , including Biden .\nThis is not a scandal of any kind . Obama 's White House was in charge of maintaining the integrity of American elections . The fact that a prominent figure in the incoming administration was secretly assuring Russian leaders that their interference in 2016 was A-OK was important information . The real scandal would have been if the Obama administration had ignored the fact that Flynn was behaving in a potentially treasonous manner .\nThis story is complicated , and I imagine readers ' eyes are starting to cross right about now , with simply trying to figure out what the hell is going on . That 's what Trump is counting on \u2014 the details are confusing , so voters simply back away with a vague sense that maybe the Obama team did something nefarious , without exactly knowing what that was . That 's precisely what happened with `` her emails . ''\nUnfortunately , as Sargent notes , it 's working . Headlines declaring that the Republicans have released a list of who heard what about Flynn 's underhanded behavior are seen as somehow `` boosting '' Trump 's narrative or helping to `` discredit '' the Russia investigation .\n`` The new information actually does not 'boost ' Trump 's claims about the Russia investigation or 'discredit ' it , '' Sargent writes . `` And if there is 'no evidence of wrongdoing , ' then it can not legitimately be 'turned into an election issue . ' ''\nRemember , this is story where a high-ranking Trump official \u2014 Flynn \u2014 delivered a backstage high-five to the Russians for interfering with our election , and then lied to the FBI about it . Now the Trump administration , in a blatantly corrupt move , has tried to force the Department of Justice to drop the charges against Flynn , even though he pled guilty to the original charges . ( A federal judge has temporarily put that effort on hold . )\nWhat Trump is currently doing is far worse than anything Richard Nixon ever did with Watergate . Yet a gullible media is working overtime to inflate the narrative that somehow it was Obama who did something wrong , because his administration followed the law and tried to stop Michael Flynn from rewarding a foreign government for interfering with our presidential election .\nWhy is this happening ? There are a few journalists out there who are in the tank for Trump and ready to sell whatever nutty conspiracy theory he throws out . But mostly it 's because so much of the mainstream media , terrified of being accused of having a `` liberal bias , '' will go out of its way to minimize real Republican scandals while blowing up often-imaginary Democratic scandals , all in a bid to appear `` balanced . ''\nThere is no balance here . Obama was a lawful and diligent president who was trying to protect our country 's democratic institutions . Trump is a grifting , cheating sleazeball who is weaponizing the DOJ to try to steal an election and who openly invites foreign interference . Any story that does n't offer clarity on this contrast is misleading the public and can not be considered legitimate journalism .\nThis kind of distorted coverage and journalistic water-carrying can work all too well , unfortunately . In 2016 , I had dinner with a friend who is n't in politics or journalism , but is generally plugged in and follows the news far more closely than most people . Somehow the topic of Clinton 's emails came up and I asked my friend what she thought was in them . She replied that Clinton had accidentally mentioned important state secrets in unsecured emails .\nShe was shocked to hear , from me , apparently for the first time , that that was n't true . As Fred Kaplan of Slate , and apparently no one else , carefully laid out at the time , there was nothing in Clinton 's emails that even slightly resembled a threat to national security . Out of 30,000 emails , exactly eight contained information that was legally classified as `` top secret . '' Seven of those eight discussed information that had already been covered extensively in the press , even if the U.S. government still considered it classified . The other email discussed an inconsequential conversation with the president of Malawi , a nation no Republican could identify on a world map with 25 guesses . If any foreign spy had gotten to it \u2014 and none did , remember ? \u2014 they would have walked away empty-handed .\nMy friend is smart . She reads the news voraciously . She understand politics better than half of political journalists , probably more . She did n't know that Clinton 's emails had nothing of interest in them . If she did n't know , who could ? This was a massive failure on the part of the news media .\nSo the sad truth is that Donald Trump is n't wrong to believe that he can keep saying `` Obamagate '' over and over and the news media will do the dirty work of creating a scandal where none exists . It 's always worked before . It is starting to work again . The only hope of saving our democracy is that the press finally stops letting its bizarre theology of `` balance '' lead once again to the promotion of conspiracy theories over facts . As Sargent 's article shows , the Washington Post is doing a good job . But will the rest of the media choose to pursue the facts over Trump 's invented scandals , or are we doomed to repeat 2016 all over again ?",
