''\nPreviously , satellite data has provided indirect geological evidence of liquid water \u2014 and we have good reason to believe lots of water existed on Mars in the past \u2014 but this new finding changes our understanding of the planet 's hydrologic cycle . It 's still extremely unlikely any life could possibly live in such cold conditions \u2014 but the finding could perhaps make it easier for humans to live on Mars in the very distant future .\nHow liquid water can form on Mars \u2014 even in freezing temperatures\nNormally , Mars would be far too cold for water to form in a liquid state . So even though scientists detected hints of water vapor being absorbed from the Martian atmosphere into the soil as far back as the 1970s Viking program , they did n't seriously consider that it 'd condense in a liquid form .\n`` We were thinking of the exchange as water vapor going into the surface and being absorbed , or freezing as ice , '' says Richard Zurek , a NASA scientist who worked on the Viking program .\nHowever , those scientists did n't take into account the heavy amounts of perchlorate salts that are have since been found in Martian soil . These salts can dramatically lower the freezing point of water \u2014 enough for the water vapor that gets absorbed into the soil nightly to pool in a liquid state . `` This transient liquid water forms within the uppermost five centimeters of the soil overnight , and dries out at sunrise , '' Mart\u00edn-Torres says .\nMart\u00edn-Torres and other scientists determined this was occurring by analyzing data collected by Curiosity on humidity , air pressure , and temperature levels above and below the soil surface . At night , during Mars 's spring and winter months , they saw water vapor getting squeezed out of the air and condensing in the soil \u2014 because cold air ca n't hold as much moisture \u2014 and in the morning , they saw water vapor rising up from the ground .\n`` They 've got a direct measurement of the relative humidity , and they know there are these salts in the ground , '' says Zurek , who was n't involved in the research . `` Together , these things tell us that there 's liquid water . ''\nIt was already known that water exists in all sorts of non-liquid forms on Mars : as ice ( both in the ice caps and in glacier belts that encircle both hemispheres ) , as water molecules bonded to minerals in the planet \u2019 s soil , and as water vapor in the atmosphere . The traces of water spotted here by Curiosity are very little , by volume , compared with what we already knew about .\nBut the finding suggests there might be much more water in the soil than we previously imagined . That 's because Curiosity collected this data in Gale Crater \u2014 a low-altitude , relatively warm location that has less atmospheric water vapor than most other parts of Mars , so should be least likely to have this sort of condensation .\n`` The fact that it happens here means it is likely more abundant elsewhere , '' says Alfred McEwan , a planetary scientist who worked on the new paper .\nThis phenomenon might be responsible for the dark streaks in Mars ' soil that McEwan and other scientists have previously spotted with satellites . These have formed seasonally , and it 's been hypothesized that they 're evidence of water melting and running downhill over the soil .\n`` These landslides occur seasonally , in warmer periods , on the slopes of Mars , '' Mart\u00edn-Torres says . `` One possible explanation for this detachment of material could be changes in state of brines present in the soil . ''\nIf these streaks are indeed formed by flowing water , it would mean there 's way more liquid water on Mars than we previously imagined . Curiosity has n't detected similar streaks itself , but it 's confirmed a mechanism through which liquid water can form at such cold temperatures : perchlorates .\nUpon hearing about liquid water , it 's tempting to imagine Martian microbes swimming around . But in reality , this finding does n't make the remote possibility of current life on Mars any more likely .\n`` We found that the conditions for the formation of liquid water are extremely cold \u2014 lower than the threshold needed for the cellular metabolism of life as we know it , '' says Mart\u00edn-Torres .\nHowever , many scientists believe Mars was much warmer and wetter billions of years ago , when it may have had a thicker atmosphere to help trap heat . The presence of perchlorates mean it would n't have had to be quite as warm for large amounts of liquid water to form , perhaps explaining the geologic evidence of ancient lake beds and other water-related features Curiosity has found so far .
