Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez. \u201d He is listed in this and most of his other court cases by that name and in others as Juan Jose Dominguez-De La Parra .

He had also been sentenced to an added 21 months for violating the terms of his supervised release after a 1998 conviction for a previous illegal reentry .\nHe wrote to the court that it was his understanding the 51 months and the 21 months were to be served concurrently . But prison officials were now trying to tell him the sentences were supposed to be consecutive .\n\u201c The defendant\u2026thanks the court for the correction , \u201d he said in the letter .\nThe court found that since the two terms had been imposed at different times , they were presumed to be consecutive .\nLopez-Sanchez served the combined 72 months . He had already served 63 months in a previous case , being in a category where immigration violations translate to heavy time thanks to some relatively minor drug busts .\nHe had spent 135 months in American federal prisons when he was returned to Mexico in late June 2009 .\nJust three months later , this man who had written of his desire to return to his own country was arrested in Eagle Pass , Texas , for once again leaving it to slip into the United States .\nHe was sentenced to another 46 months , to be followed by 21 months of supervised release , as before .

The letter\u2014first reported by the San Francisco Chronicle\u2014said Lopez-Sanchez was wanted on an outstanding $ 5,000 bench warrant arising from a 1995 bust for selling $ 20 of marijuana to an undercover cop in that city .
