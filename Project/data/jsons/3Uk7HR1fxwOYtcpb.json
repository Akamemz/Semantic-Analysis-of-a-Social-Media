The retired Texas senator \u2019 s opposition to Hillary Clinton \u2019 s health-care plan in the early 1990s inspired his political career , says the man with the second-best odds of running against Mr. Gramm \u2019 s old nemesis this fall .\n\u201c Republicans \u2019 initial response to HillaryCare was to come up with a watered-down version , partially socialized medicine , \u201d Mr. Cruz says , during a visit to the Journal this week . A law student at the time , \u201c I was yelling at the television set basically saying the heck with you , I \u2019 m just gon na go live on an island and fish , because nobody believes nothing . \u201d\nThen Mr. Gramm emerged to declare that the bill \u201c will pass over my cold , dead political body. \u201d It was his labors against \u201c what everyone said was inevitable , that both infused spinal fortitude in other members of the Senate but also began impacting the public debate , \u201d Mr. Cruz says . \u201c Victory ultimately depended on convincing the American people .

After his New York massacre on Tuesday , the morning he dropped by , Mr. Cruz says the GOP is \u201c likely headed \u201d to a contested convention , where he thinks he can defeat Donald Trump .\nThis turn is somewhat awkward too . Mr. Cruz , the populist who exalts participatory democracy , will need to convince the delegates that choosing the runner-up is not disenfranchisement . He must also , after running a campaign that targeted the most conservative and religious segments of the electorate , win the support of people who identify as somewhat conservative or moderate , as well as the so-called establishment . And after working so adeptly for years to polarize true believers and their backstabbing elected officials , he must now try to put the party back together .\nMr. Cruz seems to appreciate at least a few of these ironies , and he \u2019 s more reflective and off-script than normal . With pitiless logic , he rattles off a proof for his candidacy :\nThis election is one of those \u201c inflection points in history that change the direction of nations. \u201d A Clinton presidency could leave the U.S. economically irreparable when \u201c we are perilously , perilously close to that point. \u201d Her Supreme Court appointments would leave the Constitution \u201c unrecognizable. \u201d National-security threats would \u201c continue to metastasize . \u201d\nThere is , he suggests , a single choice . \u201c Where we are right now , if Donald Trump is the nominee , Hillary wins . I think , looking at the numbers , that is all but indisputable , \u201d Mr. Cruz says . \u201c And the only candidate who can beat Donald Trump is me . I recognize there are probably some folks around the table who , in a perfect world , would prefer a John Kasich , would prefer a Paul Ryan , would prefer a long list of other individuals , none of whom I believe have any possibility of defeating Donald Trump . \u201d\nIf the businessman closes the deal by June , Mr. Cruz says , \u201c the election is lost and I don \u2019 t think there \u2019 s a thing that can be done to save it at that point. \u201d Ergo , for anyone who isn \u2019 t ready for Hillary , he \u2019 s the only option . Q.E.D .\nAs Mr. Cruz sees it , he is \u201c effectively the last man standing \u201d out of 17 GOP candidates because of his appeal among \u201c the Reagan Democrats , union members , working class . Trump has connected powerfully with them . That has been the heart of his base . Our campaign has connected powerfully with them as well , and the reason why I believe I \u2019 ve survived where other candidates didn \u2019 t is because we could compete head-to-head with Trump for those voters . \u201d\nYet Mr. Cruz concedes that \u201c to win , we \u2019 ve got to stitch together a broad coalition , \u201d and so his campaign is now brought to you by the word unity . \u201c My central focus is unity , \u201d he says . \u201c If the non-Trump votes unifies , we beat him . \u201d\nMr. Cruz did consolidate such a coalition when he won two weeks ago in Wisconsin , which he calls \u201c across the board a broad and unifying victory \u201d among all political , income and demographic groups . Obviously there was not a similar amount of anti-Trump sentiment in New York , where Mr. Trump won three of five voters\u2014and Mr. Cruz trailed Mr. Kasich in 25 of 27 districts . The Texan may run no better in the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states that vote on Tuesday .\nIt \u2019 s true that his New York loss doesn \u2019 t justify the media \u2019 s instant somersault from Trump-is-toast to Trump-is-unstoppable stories , and that Mr. Cruz could make progress as the race moves to Indiana , Nebraska and the West Coast . But his problem on the Eastern Seaboard shows that many center-right voters continue to view a Trump-Cruz choice as a Morton \u2019 s fork . So how does he extend the Wisconsin unity formula ?\nOne new theme is what Mr. Cruz calls his \u201c tunnel vision \u201d on \u201c a positive pro-growth message focused on jobs , on raising wages , on expanding opportunity for young people\u2014that is a potent message ; it \u2019 s broad-cutting \u201d he says .\n\u201c Tone matters a lot , \u201d Mr. Cruz adds . \u201c Nobody is going to vote for a puritanical scold . I \u2019 m not running to be preacher in chief , \u201d says the candidate who appointed a \u201c national prayer team \u201d and told Iowa volunteers in December they should \u201c strap on the full armor of God . \u201d\nAs for the substance , he talks fluidly about tax reform , and in far more detail than his rival \u2019 s ballcap-based policy . Rather than the Reagan-era formula of lowering marginal rates and broadening the tax base , Mr. Cruz would create a 10 % flat rate on all individual income and swap payroll and corporate taxes for a 16 % tax on business receipts\u2014a form of value-added tax .\n\u201c From the beginning , \u201d Mr. Cruz explains , \u201c my top priority has been economic growth . I think the only way to turn around the challenges we \u2019 re facing is getting back to historic levels of growth , 3 % , 4 % , 5 % , and indeed I think we should be aggressively targeting 5 % GDP growth . \u201d\nMr. Cruz also says that he wants his tax plan to \u201c credibly \u201d speak to the economic worries of average Americans . He explains that \u201c the distributional component was quite important , and that \u2019 s a complicated thing to do. \u201d His team worked through a lot of permutations , \u201c but the problem is every time you ran those numbers , your distributional tables were garbage . Basically , you were preparing a tax plan that , with predictable certitude , everyone would scream is a massive giveaway for the rich and does nothing for the middle class and for the people who are struggling . \u201d\nSome conservatives have been skeptical of a VAT because it is such a money machine for government . \u201c It is very efficient in raising revenue , \u201d Mr. Cruz grants , \u201c although I think an economist would say you want a tax to be efficient. \u201d In particular , he says , his plan would eliminate the payroll tax , which \u201c dwarfs the income tax in terms of what people are paying . And so by eliminating the payroll tax , we \u2019 re able to have a plan that generates real after-tax income gains at every income level . \u201d\nHe continues : \u201c One of the potent virtues of the simple flat tax is its simplicity and universality. \u201d Eliminating progressive taxation , that is , handcuffs the political class , because a tax hike for the rich would be linked to a tax hike on the poor .\n\u201c Everything is 10 % . You know , one debate we had , some conservatives zero out capital gains and dividends . Going back to the world of plausibly selling this , standing on a debate stage with Hillary Clinton , I don \u2019 t believe I could with a straight face say I want Warren Buffett \u2019 s tax to be zero and everyone else to pay taxes , \u201d Mr. Cruz says . \u201c If you \u2019 re going to convince the people to adopt this , I think the fairness and uniformity was a plus . \u201d\nMr. Cruz often says Ronald Reagan overcame the same \u201c Washington cartel \u201d that is also his opposition , but he usually elides George W. Bush . Did the most recent Republican president defeat the cartel or was he a member ? \u201c That \u2019 s a complicated question , \u201d Mr. Cruz replies . \u201c I remain a big fan of President Bush \u2019 s . I \u2019 m proud to have been on that campaign . I think he \u2019 s a good man . \u201d\nBut Mr. Bush \u201c did not run as small-government conservative and I \u2019 ll give him points for candor . He did not pretend to be something he was not . . . . The energy of the administration got swept into keeping this country safe in the wake of 9/11 . And I wish more had been done facilitating the rise on the economic ladder on the domestic side . \u201d\nMr. Cruz , a Bush-Cheney 2000 alum , says there were \u201c a handful of us that dubbed ourselves the Reagan-Goldwater wing of the campaign and we periodically argued perhaps we could limit government spending , although that was a cry that did not fall on fertile ground . I remember at the end of the Bush presidency being at an election-night party with a number of the old campaign staffers . And there was a sense of lost opportunity , that so much more could have accomplished . \u201d\nIn a 2004 anthology called \u201c Thank You , President Bush , \u201d Mr. Cruz contributed an essay on what he called \u201c opportunity conservatism , \u201d meaning \u201c a single-minded focus of easing the means of ascent for those on the bottom of the economic ladder. \u201d Conservative policies and this message of upward mobility , he wrote , \u201c will resonate with the many \u2018 swing \u2019 voters in the middle. \u201d As recently as 2013 , in an op-ed in the Washington Post , Mr. Cruz argued that Republicans lost the 2012 election because they did not \u201c assess policy with a Rawlsian lens , asking how it affects those least well-off among us . We should champion the 47 % . \u201d\nThis style of self-criticism is thoughtful and sophisticated and maybe even true\u2014and yet opportunity conservatism may be its own lost political opportunity . Mr. Cruz came to a strategic conclusion that he could win the White House by running against the establishment , but the division and fury he and his allies have helped stoke has left the GOP less grand , definitely older and more importantly less of a cohesive party . Thus unity is harder to achieve , even against the threat of Mr. Trump , who a world-historical 65 % of the public views negatively , according to the most recent WSJ/NBC News poll .\nIf a Trump nomination would be \u201c catastrophic , \u201d as Mr. Cruz puts it , the best that can be said about his own 49 % negative image is that it isn \u2019 t as high as Mrs. Clinton \u2019 s , at 56 % . Perhaps he could improve his reputation by recovering some of his opportunity-conservative optimism and with an appeal to history as the first Hispanic president . Mr. Cruz also thinks he can win a general election by exposing the \u201c false but incredibly powerful narrative \u201d Democrats usually spin , namely , that \u201c Republicans are rich , out-of-touch aristocrats who don \u2019 t care about working men and women . \u201d\n\u201c We now have an election , \u201d he continues , \u201c where Hillary Clinton has made hundreds of millions of dollars exploiting her government service .
