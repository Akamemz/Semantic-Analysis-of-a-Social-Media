The Steele dossier was not just spurious in its wild claims about Carter Page eyeing billion-dollar payoffs or a bumbling Michael Cohen in Prague on a secret Trump collusionary mission , it was also so salacious that it served as lurid pornography that supercharged its odyssey throughout the bowels of the Obama government and the media .\nThe \u2018 All-Stars \u2019 and \u2018 Dream Team \u2019 Were Flawed from the Beginning\nRobert Mueller spent over $ 30 million and 674 days in vain ferreting out \u201c collusion \u201d not because it was necessarily difficult to prove such a charge either true or false . After all , the basis for the allegation , the veracity of the Steele dossier , could have been easily and quickly adjudicated .\nIndeed , already by May 2017 and the beginning of Mueller \u2019 s investigation , the dossier was roundly denounced as fraudulent . FISA transcripts of surveilled conversations had already apprised officials that there was no direct evidence of collusion , which is why Peter Strzok , well before Mueller began , had privately warned his paramour and soon to be fellow Mueller team member , Lisa Page , that \u201c there \u2019 s no big there there \u201d to the collusion charge .\nWhat explains the cost and length of the Mueller investigation ? It \u2019 s not the ( relatively easy ) challenge of adjudicating collusion . It \u2019 s the politicized make-up of his team , which relentlessly and expansively drove on to tag any Trump aide with almost any crime imaginable .\nMueller could have saved the nation a great deal of national angst and division had he only insisted on a brief series of special requisites in his personnel selections : 1 ) None of his lawyers and investigators should have donated either to the Trump or Clinton campaign ; 2 ) there should have been some numerical parity between Democratic and Republican members ; 3 ) attorneys should not in the past have directly defended either the Trump or Clinton Foundation or any aides who had previously worked for Trump or Clinton ; 4 ) they should not have transmitted on government devices any prior hyper-partisan praise or invective concerning either Trump or Clinton .\nYet Mueller could not fulfill even those minimal requirements . And the result was twofold : Mueller never escaped the charge that his team was biased ; and , because it was stocked with progressives , in its zeal to get Trump , the investigation started out with the Soviet assumption that to convict the guilty criminal Trump , they needed only enough time and money to find the right crime .\nMembers including Page , Strozk , and Weissman had either in email or in texts on their government phones or computers earlier expressed hyper-partisan , anti-Trump views .\nAnother working for Mueller , Jeannie Rhee , a prosecutor on the team , had been employed as \u201c outside counsel \u201d at one point by the Clinton Foundation . Rhee also had represented Obama official Ben Rhodes in the Benghazi controversy ; Rhodes , remember , after the election , was outspoken in his efforts to resist the Trump administration \u2019 s initiatives .\nAnother prominent Mueller team member , Aaron Zebley , had once defended Hillary Clinton \u2019 s staffer Justin Cooper . Cooper infamously had set up the private and illegal email server in the basement of the Clintons \u2019 home .\nMueller attorneys such as former federal officials Andrew Weissmann and Zainab Ahmad had also both previously communicated with , and been briefed by , Bruce Ohr , who allegedly had warned them of the unverified nature of the Steele dossier .\nMueller team member Strzok had long been directly involved in Clinton-Trump investigations . He had previously interviewed Michael Flynn ( Jan. 24 , 2017 ) to learn about possible Trump-Russian collusion . Earlier , Strozk had interrogated Clinton aides Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills in connection with the Clinton email scandal ; both had clearly lied to the FBI and both had been given de facto immunity . In short , Peter Strozk had no business posing as a disinterested investigator of Trump .\nAnother lead attorney on Robert Mueller \u2019 s team had also previously been assigned to the investigation of the Clinton emails . After the election , the unnamed Mueller team member , later revealed to be Kevin Clinesmith , had bragged in a text to an FBI attorney acquaintance of his opposition to Trump : \u201c Viva le [ sic ] resistance . \u201d\nOther than Mueller himself , a registered Republican , there was no known member of the Republican party , or Republican donor , on his legal team .\nThe point is not that Mueller deliberately selected a biased team . It \u2019 s that he did not exercise proper caution in order to avoid even the appearance of bias in such a high-profile investigation . That is why liberal activists and the media were understandably giddy on hearing of the make-up of the team , and they gushed approbation of their newly adopted \u201c army , \u201d \u201c untouchables , \u201d \u201c all-stars , \u201d and \u201c dream team \u201d \u2014 or what Max Boot praised as a \u201c hunter-killer team of crack investigators and lawyers . \u201d\nIt did not help appearances that the appointed Mueller was a longtime friend and associate of fired FBI director James Comey , who had bragged that he had sought to prompt a special-counsel investigation by deliberately leaking to the press confidential ( if not in one case classified ) memos of private conversations with the president .\nWorse still , Acting Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , who oversaw the Mueller investigation , signed off on a misleading FISA writ after the start of the Mueller investigation . Rosenstein also had provided the official rationale for firing James Comey , and he had been knee-deep in prior investigations involving both Trump and Clinton . Rosenstein allegedly had agreed to wear a wire , shortly before Mueller was appointed , to capture enough supposedly treasonous or unhinged Trump dialogue to invoke the 25th Amendment . Remember , in surreal fashion , Rosenstein stepped up to oversee Mueller \u2019 s work because , unlike Attorney General Jeff Sessions , he posed as someone who had no such conflicts of interest .\nIn the end , to justify the absence of any proof of collusion , Mueller \u2019 s progressive attorneys and investigators descended to dogging small-time wannabes and a few shady operators on charges that had nothing to do with Russian collusion \u2014 before they finally ended up ignominiously going after minor nobodies such the braggart and provocateur Roger Stone and Infowars \u2019 Jerome Corsi .\nDoes anyone doubt that a comparable conservative team of lawyers including a few Trump donors , with $ 30 million of government money , a 90 percent favorable press , and 22 months \u2019 time , while investigating Team Clinton and its hangers-on , couldn \u2019 t find scads of extraneous felonies , apart from its purported mission of investigating the collusionary Steele dossier ?\nThe bias and the wasted resources and time of the stymied Mueller investigation will not matter to progressives .
