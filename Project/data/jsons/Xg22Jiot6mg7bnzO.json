    "content": "GOP nominee Donald Trump has continued to strongly deny any connections with Russia or its leader , President Vladimir Putin , but The Guardian , a major British newspaper , on Saturday raised questions about an increasingly tangled web of connections he and key players in his campaign , namely chairman Paul Manafort , have had over the years with the country.Trump himself added fuel to the growing fire this week when he urged Russia to find and turn over more than 30,000 emails missing from Hillary Clinton 's private email server , and then by insisting in a Fox News interview that he was being sarcastic , reports The Guardian.However , a law enforcement official has told The New York Times that the `` same adversary '' that hacked the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee 's emails has also hacked Clinton 's campaign computer system . `` These are sophisticated actors , '' the official told the Times . `` We ca n't say 100 % that Mr. Putin had a hand in any of this but this kind of meddling in other countries \u2019 affairs is part of Russia \u2019 s toolkit , '' agreed Alina Polyakova , deputy director of the Dinu Patriciu Eurasia Center at the Atlantic Council , told The Guardian . `` It \u2019 s a kind of asymmetric warfare . To me , this looks like something straight from the Russian Secret Service playbook , but I \u2019 m surprised at how brazen they \u2019 ve been . `` Trump foreign policy adviser Joseph Schmitz , though , denied a connection between Trump and Putin , but noted it 's important to remember that `` we had to negotiate with Joseph Stalin when we had a common enemy called Hitler .

Firtash is under U.S indictment , while Deripaska is banned from entering the United States because of his connection with organized crime , reports The Guardian.The FBI is investigating who was behind leaking the DNC 's documents , which showed just before the party 's convention that the committee was pushing for Clinton over Bernie Sanders for the nomination.Moscow denies the connection , insisting that the United States not involve the Kremlin with its issues , but experts say Putin has been behind several attempted election cyberattack interruptions in France , Greece , Italy , and Latvia .
