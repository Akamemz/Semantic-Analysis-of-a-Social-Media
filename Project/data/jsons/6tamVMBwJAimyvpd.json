    "content": "Two pivotal dossier players , Christopher Steele and David Kramer , have provided strikingly different versions of how eight Washington news outlets were provided with the document \u2019 s anti-Trump charges during the presidential transition .\nMr. Steele , the dossier \u2019 s creator , said in a written , signed declaration in a London libel case that he instructed Mr. Kramer to jealously guard the document except for national security purposes tied to Sen. John McCain .\nMr. Kramer , a McCain associate , contradicts this account . He has testified that Mr. Steele told him to freely pass the information to media , specifically to CNN and BuzzFeed , which were the first to report the dossier \u2019 s existence in January 2017 .\nRepublicans have challenged Mr. Steele \u2019 s credibility , using words such as \u201c hoax \u201d and \u201c disinformation \u201d to describe allegations that he obtained from Kremlin intelligence and injected into Washington \u2019 s political system .\nNow , Mr. Steele \u2019 s and Mr. Kramer \u2019 s conflicting accounts add to questions about the credibility of the former British spy .\nThe dossier emerged as one of the most important opposition research papers in modern U.S. politics . Its purpose was to destroy the Trump candidacy and presidency .

Both Fusion and Mr. Steele were paid by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee .\nMr. Steele asserted in court declarations in London that he instructed Mr. Kramer to use dossier information only in an official national security capacity tied to McCain , then chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee . McCain provided a dossier copy to then-FBI Director James B. Comey , although the bureau received the same document by December 2016 .\nMr. Kramer , in a deposition in a second libel case in Florida , tells a different story .\nMr. Steele accused President Trump of being in the middle of an \u201c extensive conspiracy \u201d with the Kremlin to interfere in the election . Special counsel Robert Mueller reported March 22 that his 22-month investigation failed to establish such a conspiracy . No Trump person was charged with collusion .\nIn his final memo in December 2016 , Mr. Steele accused Russian entrepreneur Aleksej Gubarev of hacking Democratic Party computers under pressure from Russian intelligence . Mr. Gubarev , a Cyprus-based developer of web hosting services , filed a defamation lawsuit against Mr. Steele in London . A trial is expected this fall .\nIt was in the London case that Mr. Steele , who collects intelligence for clients in secret , filed his first on-the-record statements in April and May 2017 about how he created his infamous dossier .\nHe depicted his actions as cautious when it came to dealing with Mr. Kramer , who was dispatched by McCain to Britain after a Steele associate briefed the senator .\nFor example , Mr. Steele \u2019 s attorneys made this court declaration on his behalf : \u201c The Defendants [ Mr. Steele and his private business ] understood that the contents of the memoranda would be treated in the strictest confidence and would only be used by Senator McCain in his official capacity for the sole purpose of analyzing , investigating and verifying their contents to enable such action to be taken as necessary for the purposes of protecting U.S. national security .
