    "content": "Wow , think about that . The only president elected to follow a member of his own party without creating some sort of cosmic disaster was George H.W . Bush . No wonder he always looks so cheerful .\nThese factoids refer only to elections between Republicans and Democrats . Even with nearly two years to go ( but seven months until the Iowa straw poll ! ) , we don \u2019 t have enough time to deal with the Whigs . Our two current parties began duking it out in \u2014 yes ! \u2014 1856 , when Buchanan ran against the first Republican presidential candidate , John Charles Fr\u00e9mont . Fr\u00e9mont was an explorer whose political enemies claimed had resorted to cannibalism during one unfortunate Western expedition . I am just telling you this to make it clear how interesting American history can be .\nAnyhow , Buchanan won and went on triumphantly to become possibly the worst president ever . Almost every chief executive in American history has his defenders . I had a very nice time last year talking with people who feel Warren Harding hasn \u2019 t been given his due . But you very seldom run into fans of Buchanan , the man who cozied up to slaveholders and failed to stop Southern secession .\n\u201c He was terrible , \u201d said Jean Baker , a professor of history at Goucher College and Buchanan biographer . This despite arriving in office with one of the best r\u00e9sum\u00e9s in the history of presidential candidates : Buchanan had been a congressman , envoy to Russia , senator , secretary of state and minister to Britain . \u201c He was sitting around waiting and waiting with the best C.V. of any president we \u2019 ve ever had . That \u2019 s what \u2019 s so ironic , \u201d said Baker .\nDid I mention that Buchanan was also the last former secretary of state elected president ?\nI don \u2019 t think Clinton-Buchanan commonalities are likely to be a big concern . Liberals worry that Hillary might be overly aggressive when it comes to foreign policy ; I don \u2019 t think anybody thinks she \u2019 d sit on her hands and let any states secede .
