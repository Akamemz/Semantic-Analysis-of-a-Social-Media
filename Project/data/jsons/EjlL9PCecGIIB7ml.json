Now what happens ?\nChief of staff to President Donald Trump was seen by many as the job that no one wanted , a thankless post with an impossible mission . But when Trump soured on his former chief , John Kelly , Mick Mulvaney did n't see a quagmire \u2014 he saw his next gig .\nMulvaney , the president \u2019 s budget director , who has also moonlighted as the head of a consumer protection agency conservatives hate , had angled for the job for months .

A former congressman who has steered clear of scandal and remained a favorite of the president , he was tapped for the job at a time when Trump will need a politically minded partner who understands Congress . Mulvaney has maintained relationships with influential members on Capitol Hill and may be able to help him deal with the Democratic House takeover in January .\nThe position has proved challenging for others , first Reince Priebus , the consummate insider and connected former party chairman , and then John Kelly , the retired Marine general who made futile attempts to impose discipline in the West Wing .\nThe failures of his predecessors and the daunting year ahead did not deter Mulvaney , who , according to several current and former White House officials , has spent several months openly lobbying for the job . Reports that he was uninterested in the job , these people said , were in fact an effort to increase his chances of landing it by playing hard to get .\nMulvaney didn \u2019 t initially have a natural rapport with Trump \u2014 Priebus and House Speaker Paul Ryan , the sort of Republicans against whom Trump had campaigned , and about whom he remains skeptical , pushed him for budget director . But Mulvaney developed a relationship with Trump on the golf course , often staying in Washington over weekends rather than returning to his native South Carolina , to hit the links with Trump at his Virginia country club .\nMulvaney has developed a good relationship with the Trump over time \u2014 enough so that the president named him acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau when the post became vacant . White House aides say he is unlikely to attempt to reform the president \u2019 s habits of spending much of his time watching television and tweeting , or to curtail the influence of Trump \u2019 s daughter and son-in-law , Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner , on the policymaking process .\nInstead , Mulvaney is expected to get Trump on the road as much as possible heading into his reelection campaign , capitalizing on the president \u2019 s love of campaign rallies while trying to sprinkle into the events as much policy talk on taxes and regulation as he can .\nDespite his experience on Capitol Hill , both Republicans and Democrats questioned how effective Mulvaney would be as a liaison between the White House and his former colleagues .\nMulvaney , 51 , made a name for himself on Capitol Hill in 2013 as a founder of the House Freedom Caucus . He was a perpetual thorn in the side of the Republican leadership , opposing government funding measures , debt limit increases and bipartisan budget agreements . He hounded speakers John Boehner and Ryan to shut down the government in order to secure conservative victories , even urging Republican leaders to risk a credit default in order to force Democrats to accept spending cuts .\nBut everything seemed to change for Mulvaney when Trump won . While he was always a reluctant Trump supporter \u2014 once calling candidate Trump \u201c a terrible human being \u201d \u2014 Mulvaney saw Trump 's victory as an opportunity to rise in Republican ranks and advocate for his positions from a more prominent perch . With few Republicans willing to work in a Trump administration , Mulvaney made an aggressive bid for Office of Management and Budget director , striking an uncharacteristic d\u00e9tente with Ryan just as his Freedom Caucus friends were planning to boot him from the speaker \u2019 s chair .\nRyan recommended Mulvaney to top Trump officials for OMB , giving his candidacy added heft . Mulvaney in turn nominated Ryan to return to the speakership , a conservative endorsement that infuriated the Freedom Caucus .\nRepublicans sent mixed messages over the weekend about whether they think Mulvaney will be able to tame the president \u2019 s impulses , keep spending in check and improve the White House 's relations with Capitol Hill . The self-described \u201c right-wing nutjob \u201d who helped chase Boehner out of his job has shown over the past two years that he is willing to put his personal ideology aside to secure Trump wins or help other officials advance their agendas . Indeed , some conservatives on the Hill see him as a sellout , a ladder climber who puts career advancement over principle .\nMulvaney allies argue that he has done the best he can , given the president he serves , and has advanced conservative priorities where he could .\nThey point in particular to his yearlong stewardship of the the CFPB , where he curtailed funding and imposed a six-month freeze on data collection , the lifeblood of nearly all the organization \u2019 s operations .\nNo aspect of the bureau , the brainchild of Trump nemesis Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( D-Mass . ) , was too small for Mulvaney \u2019 s attention . He even required employees to call it the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection and rearranged the letters in the agency \u2019 s front office , insisting he was merely following the statute as he worked to undo years of Democratic branding .\nBut Trump has never pretended to be an ideological conservative interested in reducing the national debt or overhauling entitlements , even though Mulvaney has tried to convince him on the merits .\n\u201c He has taken the shape of the offices he \u2019 s held , but I think you have to do that when you take an administration job , and he \u2019 s been a voice for conservative priorities internally . This could \u2019 ve been much worse for conservatives , \u201d said Yuval Levin , editor of National Affairs , the leading conservative policy journal .\n\u201c What he always says is , as long as he \u2019 s comfortable that the president has been presented all the options and all the arguments , then he \u2019 s comfortable with whatever decision the president makes , \u201d said one person who worked closely with Mulvaney at the budget office . \u201c If a member wants to call him a hypocrite for that , fine , but he \u2019 s not the president . \u201d\nThe former South Carolina congressman will take the reins at a challenging time . The coming year will bring a Democratic takeover of the House , a potentially damaging report from special counsel Robert Mueller , and a plethora of additional investigations into Trump \u2019 s businesses and practices .\nMulvaney \u2019 s first test comes next week , when Trump will have to decide whether to shutter the government to get the funding he wants for his border wall with Mexico . Hill conservatives , including Freedom Caucus leaders Mark Meadows ( R-N.C. ) and Jim Jordan ( R-Ohio ) , Mulvaney \u2019 s old Hill pals , have urged Trump to embrace the fight . But while Mulvaney used to cheerlead shutdown showdowns as well , he was already urging Trump to kick the deadline into January .\nJordan praised Mulvaney \u2019 s promotion in an interview Saturday , calling the move an \u201c ideal selection \u201d for conservatives .\n\u201c I think he \u2019 s a great pick \u2014 and , oh , by the way , he happens to be one of the founding members of the Freedom Caucus . ... He also happens to be conservative . \u2026 I think that \u2019 s good for the country and good for the president . \u201d\nMulvaney \u2019 s history as a member of the Trump administration is , in part , why some conservatives may be worried . On his watch , the budget deficit grew by $ 113 billion in fiscal year 2018 due to the Republican tax bill and increased federal spending on defense , Medicaid and Social Security , which Trump has refused to cut .\nSome , however , are pleased to see Mulvaney has displayed a willingness to compromise . And he has quietly maintained tight relationships with top Republicans such as Kevin McCarthy , the incoming House minority leader ; Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina ; outgoing Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina and Sen. Tim Scott , also of South Carolina .\nMick Mulvaney is seen in Congress in 2016 . \u201c Everyone respects him , \u201d Rep.
