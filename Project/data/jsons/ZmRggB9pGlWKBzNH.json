He could expand because bigger machinery and improved soil-conditioning techniques allowed him to farm more land more efficiently .\n\u201c We started with a four-row harvester and now we \u2019 re running a 12-row one , \u201d he says .\nThe farming cycle is now turning against farmers . Net cash farm income is expected to fall for the fourth year in a row this year . Midwestern farmland prices have fallen sharply from record highs . Nevertheless , by expanding and becoming more efficient , Mr. Dawson is joining the ranks of superfarmers \u2013 a longterm trend that is putting farm production and wealth into fewer and fewer hands .\nThe level of concentration varies by crop and by region .\nA quarter-century ago , the South 's big cotton farmers ( with at least 1,000 acres planted ) were already producing 30 percent of the nation 's crop ; by 2007 , it was half , according to the United States Department of Agriculture . Midwestern corn and soybean farmers \u2013 once the backbone of a rural middle class \u2013 are moving in the same direction . By 2007 , big farmers produced nearly a third of the corn crop ( up from 9 percent in 1992 ) .\n\u201c What most people think of as family farms don \u2019 t exist in large numbers anymore , but what exists are large family businesses \u2026 in the $ 3 to $ 5 million range , \u201d says Mr. Peters , the Iowa State sociologist .\nAnd the bigger the farm , the bigger its average profit margin . By 2011 , as crop prices were rising , the average midsize family farm was worth $ 2.6 million and earned $ 156,000 a year \u2013 two-thirds of that from farming . Large family farms were worth $ 4.8 million and earning $ 413,000 ; very large farms , just under $ 10 million and earning $ 1.7 million .\nAs this wealth accumulates , it is being spread to fewer and fewer people . The midsize to very large operations represent less than 8 percent of the 2.1 million farm households in the United States , most of which rely on income outside agriculture for their livelihood . And as the big operations become more mechanized and efficient , they 're not hiring droves of new farmhands . Mr. Dawson has reduced his permanent crew from dozens in the 1970s to about nine today .\n\u201c A typical [ large ] farmer is not going to admit that they \u2019 re making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year , in part because nowadays \u2026 those who have traditionally performed jobs on the farm are left out of any sort of share in the wealth that \u2019 s being produced , \u201d says Jonathan Bryant , a history professor at Georgia Southern University in Statesboro , who studies small-town life in the South . \u201c That \u2019 s become a difficult situation for a lot of folks , and many just leave .
