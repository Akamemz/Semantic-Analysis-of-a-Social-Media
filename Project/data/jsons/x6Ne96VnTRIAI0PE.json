But the wall of establishment opposition to Trump \u2019 s candidacy had begun cracking days before New Jersey \u2019 s governor barreled right through it .\nFrom Rep. Duncan Hunter and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy , who have signaled an openness to working with Trump , to Mike Huckabee \u2019 s daughter and adviser Sarah Huckabee Sanders , who officially joined Trump 's campaign this week , Republican officials and operatives are coming to grips with the reality that this anti-establishment hero is now the presumptive GOP nominee .\n\u201c Folks are now going through the stages of grief , \u201d said one high-ranking Republican operative . \u201c Some are already at acceptance . \u201d\nFor Christie , the endorsement was his only path to national relevance after quitting the presidential contest . For Trump , it was much more . Not only did it allow him to change the news cycle after getting roughed up by the establishment \u2019 s last hope , Marco Rubio , but it lent credence to Trump \u2019 s charge that Washington is full of easily maneuvered politicians .\nHere are five takeaways from the Republican primary \u2019 s Friday shake-up .\nAfter Trump \u2019 s blowout win in Nevada Tuesday night , his phone apparently rang off the hook .\nOn Wednesday , Trump won his first endorsements from members of Congress : Hunter and Rep. Chris Collins ( R-N.Y. ) . On Monday , the day before his romp in the Nevada caucuses , McCarthy , a California Republican , said he believed Trump will be his party \u2019 s nominee and that he \u2019 d be able to work with him .\nMeanwhile , several Capitol Hill staffers , including a congressional chief of staff , and a number of state GOP staffers , have begun peddling their resumes to Trump \u2019 s campaign , according to a source involved in those back-channel conversations . \u201c Everybody wants on the bus before it leaves the station , \u201d he said .\nHistory has shown that the political establishment always wins . Amidst this strange election cycle in which establishment candidates have fallen by the wayside , some establishment Republicans appear willing to win just by switching teams .\nTrump wants to act like the frontrunner that he is . On the debate stage Thursday night , his tempered responses about Planned Parenthood and Obamacare were those of a candidate already starting to think about the general election .\nIn his closing statement , Trump distinguished himself from his rival \u201c politicians. \u201d But Trump \u2019 s sense of timing is that of a savvy politician , not a clueless neophyte .\nAfter Rubio tripped him up , Trump wasted no time finding a way out of a Friday morning news cycle that was being dominated by coverage of Rubio on a post-debate victory lap , savagely mocking Trump by reading his tweets aloud\u2014gleefully pointing out his typos\u2014to the crowd at his rally in Dallas .\nBut where Trump has sold himself as a businessman with a history of buying influence with corrupt politicians on both sides , his acceptance of his former political rival \u2019 s support on Friday now raises questions about the terms of the deal struck between the two .\nRival campaigns drew reporters \u2019 attention to a story about Trump \u2019 s son-in-law , Jared Kushner , getting $ 93 million in tax breaks from Christie \u2019 s state government to build a high-rise in Jersey City . \u201c I know a lot of people thought he was going after Marco on behalf of Jeb , \u201d one Rubio backer said privately about Christie \u2019 s attack on Rubio two debates ago . \u201c But I said even then , the Jersey connection made me think he was doing Trump \u2019 s dirty work . \u201d\nIn 2012 , Chris Christie was tapped to give the keynote address at the Republican National Convention .

He questioned Trump \u2019 s \u201c thin-skinned \u201d temperament and asserted that he is not \u201c the kind of person you want to stand on the stage next September against Hillary . \u201d\nThat makes his sudden break with the majority of his party \u2019 s official figures , most of whom are still horrified by the prospect of a Trump presidency , so remarkable .\nBut viewed in the context of 2016 , it \u2019 s less surprising .\nChristie won just 449 votes more than Ben Carson in the two states where they went head-to-head .

The establishment\u2019s opposition to Trump is crumbling.\n\nAfter Trump\u2019s blowout win in Nevada Tuesday night, his phone apparently rang off the hook.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump won his first endorsements from members of Congress: Hunter and Rep.

Amidst this strange election cycle in which establishment candidates have fallen by the wayside, some establishment Republicans appear willing to win just by switching teams.\n\n2. Trump is actually...a savvy politician!\n\nTrump wants to act like the frontrunner that he is. On the debate stage Thursday night, his tempered responses about Planned Parenthood and Obamacare were those of a candidate already starting to think about the general election.\n\nIn his closing statement, Trump distinguished himself from his rival \u201cpoliticians.\u201d But Trump\u2019s sense of timing is that of a savvy politician, not a clueless neophyte.\n\nAfter Rubio tripped him up, Trump wasted no time finding a way out of a Friday morning news cycle that was being dominated by coverage of Rubio on a post-debate victory lap, savagely mocking Trump by reading his tweets aloud\u2014gleefully pointing out his typos\u2014to the crowd at his rally in Dallas.\n\nBut where Trump has sold himself as a businessman with a history of buying influence with corrupt politicians on both sides, his acceptance of his former political rival\u2019s support on Friday now raises questions about the terms of the deal struck between the two.\n\nRival campaigns drew reporters\u2019 attention to a story about Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, getting $93 million in tax breaks from Christie\u2019s state government to build a high-rise in Jersey City. \u201cI know a lot of people thought he was going after Marco on behalf of Jeb,\u201d one Rubio backer said privately about Christie\u2019s attack on Rubio two debates ago. \u201cBut I said even then, the Jersey connection made me think he was doing Trump\u2019s dirty work.\u201d\n\n3. Christie had no other play\n\nIn 2012, Chris Christie was tapped to give the keynote address at the Republican National Convention. In 2014, he led the Republican Governors Association, serving as the party\u2019s main emissary to donors on behalf of GOP governors. And it wasn\u2019t so long ago that this establishment figure was a vocal Trump critic. He questioned Trump\u2019s \u201cthin-skinned\u201d temperament and asserted that he is not \u201cthe kind of person you want to stand on the stage next September against Hillary.\u201d\n\nThat makes his sudden break with the majority of his party\u2019s official figures, most of whom are still horrified by the prospect of a Trump presidency, so remarkable.\n\nBut viewed in the context of 2016, it\u2019s less surprising.\n\nChristie won just 449 votes more than Ben Carson in the two states where they went head-to-head.

Jeb Bush is gone and John Kasich a long shot. That left Trump, Christie\u2019s long-time friend who just happens to be sitting 20 points ahead of everyone else in the polls.\n\nSo for a politician who doesn\u2019t like being out of the limelight and is facing the prospect of his career coming to an end, Friday\u2019s endorsement wasn\u2019t a profile in courage. It was the last, best option.\n\n4. Rubio\u2019s now in the fight of his life.\n\nAfter mostly staying out of Trump\u2019s direct line of sight and refusing to attack him up until now, Rubio has gone from zero to 100 miles an hour when it comes to finally taking aim at the current GOP frontrunner. And he\u2019s alighted on the same tactic that President Obama showed five years earlier to be an effective approach to making Trump look small: savage mockery.\n\nNot only did he make fun of Trump misspelling \u201cchocker\u201d and \u201choner\u201d in his tweets, Rubio told his crowd Friday morning that Trump was sweating profusely during the commercial breaks Thursday night and even suggested that he\u2019d wet his pants.\n\nRubio is hoping to bury Trump in an avalanche of opposition research about his business failures and apparent hypocrisy of hiring undocumented foreign workers to build Trump Tower.

But this is altogether different now, with two of the biggest backyard brawlers in politics coming at him.\n\nChristie will serve as a reminder of Rubio\u2019s worst moment in the campaign and continue to lambast him for not showing up to work in the Senate. A political performance artist par excellence, Trump mocked Rubio\u2019s penchant for thirst-quenching Friday by splashing bottled water on his supporters. \u201cThe fight of Marco Rubio\u2019s life is here, and it\u2019ll either energize his campaign or it\u2019ll end it,\u201d one Rubio supporter said Friday. \u201cBut you have to slay the dragon at some point, and if he does, he\u2019ll be more than ready for Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\n5. Cruz has been completely marginalized on the eve of Super Tuesday.\n\nIf Rubio saw his dream news cycle snatched away by Trump, he can at least take solace in knowing that he is, at least for the moment, Trump\u2019s top target\u2014not essentially forgotten like Ted Cruz. The Texas senator, whose path to the nomination hinges on steamrolling across the South on Tuesday\u2019s SEC primary, has been relegated to an afterthought just days ahead of those critical contests.\n\nFor more than a week, Cruz\u2019s campaign has been trying to reverse a negative narrative about its \u201cdirty tricks\u201d that resulted in a disappointing third place finish in South Carolina. After another embarrassing flap earlier this week that led Cruz to fire his communications director, Rubio overshadowed Cruz in Thursday night\u2019s debate as the Florida senator attacked Trump with more vigor and success.\n\nOn Friday, cable news coverage of the primary, which will have an even greater impact as the race broadens out into more of an air war across more than a dozen states, reflected the race as the Rubio campaign wants voters to see it: a two-man fight between their man and Trump.",
