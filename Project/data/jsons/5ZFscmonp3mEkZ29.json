We know what Trump is doing and resent him for doing it , and we respond as he wants . When Trump decided last month to launch an attack against football players who take a knee during the national anthem , supporters and foes alike ran to the the trenches to pick up a rifle for their side . They couldn \u2019 t resist .\nWhy does Trump do it ? The most widely accepted explanation , one I \u2019 ve bought into myself , is that it \u2019 s a distraction from his failures and awful policies . Many of Trump \u2019 s \u201c deplorables \u201d also fear something more : that it \u2019 s a cover as he prepares to sell them out . But Trump has a habit of tiptoeing to the brink of displeasing his base and then pulling back . He has murmured about considering restrictions on \u201c bump stocks \u201d for guns , after the deaths of nearly 60 people in Las Vegas , but so far that \u2019 s it . He has hinted that he \u2019 d be on board with any legislation to legalize the \u201c Dreamers , \u201d but the White House then released a list of conditions much tougher than Democrats had been led to expect .\nFurthermore , if the recent victory of Roy Moore over Luther Strange in the Republican primary in Alabama underscored anything , it was that voters care about Trumpism more than Trump . No amount of culture-war flame fanning will lead Trump \u2019 s base to give the White House a pass on the issues about which it cares most deeply , such as immigration and the Second Amendment . On the latter , Steve Bannon has warned that any move to the left on guns would \u201c be the end of everything , \u201d even more consequential than a move on immigration . Trump hears that , and he respects his base far more than Trump \u2019 s enemies think he does .\nDistraction is helpful , of course , and Trump likes to control the conversation , especially when things are going poorly . But we should also entertain a different theory for why Trump is fighting the culture war : he wants to win it .\nThis naturally raises the preliminary question of how to define the culture war . It has been raging for at least 50 years , but whatever it was back in 1992 , when Pat Buchanan used the term in a speech to the Republican National Convention , bears only partial resemblance to what it has become today . Back then , sexual morality was more central to the culture war . Today , though , it has grown into something different , perhaps bigger . Scholar Michael Lind argues that we \u2019 ve moved on to a \u201c border war , \u201d meaning fights over multicultural globalism and immigration . All of this is arguably part of an even larger identity war over heritage and nationhood that rages within much of the western world as well as Russia .\nAs the international right sees it , much of the west , especially its intellectual class , has come to despise its own roots , seeing the past of western nations as a story of plunder and oppression . The inevitable byproducts of such demoralization are a receptivity to foreign ideas and a disinclination toward self-defense . After all , if your kingdom consists of ill-gotten gains , it \u2019 s hard to justify keeping it for yourself .
