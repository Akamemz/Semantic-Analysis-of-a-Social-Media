District court Judge James Boasberg , an Obama appointee , came down in favor of the plaintiffs , led by the National Health Law Program and Kentucky Equal Justice Center , who sought to block the work requirements from taking effect on July 1 as planned .\nThe federal government is obligated under federal law to consider whether a Medicaid proposal advances the program \u2019 s objectives , the judge wrote , and the Trump administration failed to meet that standard before approving Kentucky \u2019 s plan .\n\u201c The Secretary never adequately considered whether Kentucky HEALTH would in fact help the state furnish medical assistance to its citizens , a central objective of Medicaid , Boasberg said in his decision . \u201c This signal omission renders his determination arbitrary and capricious . \u201d\nThe ruling puts the future of Medicaid work requirements in doubt . The Trump administration has made them a priority , encouraging states to put forward proposals that require many nondisabled , nonelderly adults to work or look for employment . If they fail to meet these requirements , they could lose their health insurance .\nFour states \u2014 Kentucky , Indiana , Arkansas , and New Hampshire \u2014 have had their work requirements approved by the administration .

But at the very least , it should delay the implementation of work requirements in Kentucky .\nThe underlying case hinges on a pretty simple argument : Does requiring Medicaid recipients to work to receive benefits further the program \u2019 s goals ? Many advocates , who argue that Medicaid is first and foremost a health insurance program , believe that work requirements are contrary to Medicaid \u2019 s purpose if they cut people \u2019 s access to health care .\nThe state of Kentucky and the Trump administration obviously feel differently . They argue that requiring work should improve Medicaid recipients \u2019 economic station and therefore their health \u2014 in spite of evidence that most Medicaid recipients already work or would not be expected to work . And those who do work could still lose their coverage because the work requirements are not structured in a way that reflects the realities of low-income work , like irregular or seasonal hours .\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation has estimated that 1.4 million to 4 million Americans \u2014 out of about 70 million covered by Medicaid \u2014 could lose their coverage if work requirements were imposed nationwide . The vast majority of the coverage losses would result from enrollees failing to report their compliance to the state , not because they were failing to fulfill the work or job search criteria .\nIn his ruling , Boasberg specifically chastised the Trump administration for failing to consider Kentucky \u2019 s own internal estimate that as many as 95,000 people could lose their Medicaid coverage within the first five years after Medicaid work requirements took effect .\n\u201c At bottom , the record shows that 95,000 people would lose Medicaid coverage , and yet the Secretary paid no attention to that deprivation .
