    "content": "( CNN ) When the engine on the left wing broke in mid-flight , the pilots of Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 had to deal with a 737 that suddenly banked left on its own , well past any angle they would use .\nThe plane was pitched at an angle of more than 40 degrees for a few unnerving seconds before it leveled out and began an emergency descent , National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Robert Sumwalt told reporters Wednesday in Philadelphia .\nThe plane was ascending past 32,500 feet Tuesday morning and 144 passengers were settled in for a three-hour flight when a fan blade in the No . 1 engine apparently broke . A window next to a passenger in row 14 shattered and she was sucked into the hole while other passengers struggled to pull her back into the cabin .\nThe woman -- identified as Jennifer Riordan of Albuquerque , New Mexico -- died at a hospital . Seven other people had minor injuries .\nRiordan died from blunt impact trauma of the head , neck and torso , a spokesman for the Philadelphia Department of Public Health said .\nSumwalt said investigators do not know how the window broke . There was no acrylic found in the plane , he added .\nHe said the plane rolled to 41 degrees , when pilots rarely go to 25 degrees .\nCaptain Tammie Jo Shults and First Officer Darren Ellisor shrugged off praise for their actions in landing the plane without further loss of life .\n`` We all feel we were simply doing our jobs , '' Shults and Ellisor said in a statement posted on the airline 's social media pages . `` Our hearts are heavy . On behalf of the entire crew , we appreciate the outpouring of support from the public and our coworkers as we all reflect on one family 's profound loss . ''\nThe pilots said they would not be doing any media interviews .\nThe flight was 20 minutes into its trip from New York to Dallas .\nSuddenly , alarms blared in the cockpit as what passengers said sounded like an explosion boomed from the left side of the plane . Oxygen masks swiftly dropped from the ceiling .\nWhat followed was a terrifying sequence of events that left Riordan dead , seven others injured and precipitated an emergency landing . The plane 's engine had undergone a visual inspection just two days before .\nSouthwest said in an email that on Sunday workers had looked at the inlet , exhaust , cowlings , and fairings .\n`` The next scheduled blade lube , and the first ultrasonic inspection on the No . 1 engine of aircraft 772 , was scheduled to be accomplished in December of this year , '' Southwest said .\nSouthwest Airlines Flight 1380 took off from LaGuardia Airport at 10:27 a.m. and landed in Philadelphia about 11:23 a.m .\nThe Boeing 737 was headed to Dallas with 144 passengers and five crew members . For about 20 minutes , everything seemed calm . Then `` a loud boom '' suddenly jolted the plane , passenger Marty Martinez said .\n`` About five seconds later , all the oxygen masks deployed , '' he said . `` I immediately knew something was wrong . It just did n't register what could have been . ''\nSomething in the engine broke apart midair and burst through the window , passengers said . A woman was sucked toward the hole where the window once had been as passengers struggled to pull her back in .\n`` Everybody was going crazy , and yelling and screaming , '' Martinez said . `` As the plane is going down , I am literally purchasing internet just so I can get some kind of communication to the outside world . ''\nAs the plane quickly descended and passengers continued scrambling to pull the woman away from the window , other passengers stuffed clothes and jackets into the hole , said Martinez , who was sitting two rows away from the woman . Those items got sucked out of the plane , too , he said .\n`` We could feel the air from the outside coming in , and then we had smoke kind of coming in the window , '' Martinez said .\nIn the chaos , it was hard to hear anyone . Flight tracking website Flightradar24 estimated the plane descended from 31,684 feet to 10,000 feet in about five minutes .\nJUST WATCHED Southwest passenger : I feel lucky to be alive Replay More Videos ...
