But as the 2016 GOP campaign for the White House gets underway , the South finds itself yet again without a native son in a leading role .\nAs party leaders gathered here for the Southern Republican Leadership Conference , a traditional candidate cattle call that draws many of the party \u2019 s presidential hopefuls and attracted around 2,000 activists this year , there was no shortage of reminders about the South \u2019 s importance , both financially and electorally , to the party \u2019 s political fortunes .\nYet the three Republicans who lead the field are a governor from Wisconsin , Scott Walker , and Sen. Marco Rubio and former Gov .

Two other candidates with tenuous claims to the Southern candidate mantle \u2014 Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Canada-born Texas Sen. Ted Cruz \u2014 are faring better but still have a ways to go in expanding their voter bases .
