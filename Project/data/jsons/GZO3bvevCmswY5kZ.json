The staff at the White House has been depleted , \u2019 \u2019 he says . \u201c This situation is a big-time challenge . \u201d\nBeyond confusion about Washington 's strategic direction , there are serious Israeli misgivings about the machinery of U.S. policy . Given the turnover among the Trump administration \u2019 s senior ranks and attrition among career policymakers in executive branch bureaucracies , there are questions about whether the Trump administration can manage a serious crisis , such as the current clash with Iran .\nWas the killing a regional game changer that will curtail the reach of Tehran , or just a one-off assassination of a man Israelis consider an arch terrorist ? And could the attack trigger a U.S. withdrawal from Iraq that , some fear , would create a domino effect ?\nThe U.S. killing of Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani was broadly welcomed in Israel . But for all their initial elation , Israeli national security experts are still struggling to figure out the administration \u2019 s strategy in the Middle East .\nIn the hours after the killing of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli opposition leaders alike were quick to praise the Trump administration .\nThe U.S. drone strike had eliminated a hardened foe of Israel who sought , effectively , to encircle the country \u2019 s borders with hostile and well-armed proxies .\nBut for all their initial elation , Israeli national security experts have been left with a nagging hangover : Like Saudi Arabia and other key players in the region , they are still struggling to figure out the administration \u2019 s strategy in the Middle East .\nWas the killing of General Soleimani a regional game changer that will curtail the reach of Tehran , or just the one-off assassination of a man they consider an archterrorist ?\nMoreover , many voice concerns about whether President Donald Trump and his administration have sufficient expert staffing and best practices to manage a military conflict against Iran , Israel \u2019 s most powerful regional foe .\nAt the core of the uncertainty is whether the surprise killing of General Soleimani signals a reversal by the United States , Israel \u2019 s most important ally , of a recent trend of disengagement from the Middle East .\nA rising cycle of direct confrontation with Iran would be at odds with the U.S. reluctance to become embroiled in the Syrian civil war and to retaliate for attacks on regional allies like Saudi Arabia , as well as with the pullback from its northern Syria alliance with Syrian Kurds .\n\u201c I hear many , many questions about U.S. strategy in our [ national security ] system , \u2019 \u2019 says Michael Herzog , a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and a retired Israeli brigadier general whose late father , Chaim Herzog , was Israel \u2019 s sixth president . \u201c To what extent this signals a real change of course , or [ conversely ] is kind of an eruption given the fact that the Iranians crossed an American red line . \u201d\nIn the latter case , he says the Israelis surmise that \u201c the U.S. will revert to its previous course , which strategically is more about retreating from the region rather than increasing its footprint . \u201d\nPresident Trump enjoys overwhelming popularity in Israel for recognizing Jerusalem as Israel \u2019 s capital and taking a hard line on Iran , and for his support for Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights , the strategic plateau seized from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war . His decision to take out General Soleimani , who for decades cultivated a network of allied militias in Lebanon , the Gaza Strip , and Syria to form a forward ring of pressure around Israel , figures as another notch in his belt here .\n\u201c Israelis feel satisfaction in the elimination of Soleimani , considering all the blood on his hands , and his leadership of the regional campaign to marshal Shia forces against Israel , \u2019 \u2019 says Daniel Shapiro , a former U.S. ambassador to Israel and a senior fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies ( INSS ) at Tel Aviv University . \u201c It \u2019 s consistent with an Israeli ethos of striking first at terrorist leaders . \u201d\nMr. Trump \u2019 s public popularity and his close ties with Mr. Netanyahu make Israeli politicians and experts cautious about airing public criticism of the leader of Israel \u2019 s main ally .\nStill , policy hands are more focused on Mr. Trump \u2019 s repeated declaration of his desire to be done with the \u201c endless wars \u201d in the region and on the actions that signaled a declining commitment . And only a few months ago , the president was flirting with the idea of negotiating with Iran .\nIn late December , the Israeli military chief of staff , Lt. Gen. Aviv Kochavi , complained that it would be better if Israelis weren \u2019 t the \u201c only ones \u201d acting against Iran .\nDespite the surprise assassination , the U.S. military \u2019 s leak of a letter purporting to announce plans to withdraw from Iraq \u00ad\u2013 later denied by U.S. Defense Secretary Mike Esper \u2013 only fueled those concerns .\nFormer Prime Minister Ehud Barak , who led an aggressive Israeli policy toward Iran as defense minister under Mr. Netanyahu , says the leaked letter represents the deeper desires of an unpredictable commander in chief .\n\u201c It \u2019 s not completely far-fetched to think that Trump would exchange blows with the Iranians \u2013 this is the main worry of allies in the region \u2013 and at a certain stage , when the blows become more serious , you wake up one day , and it turns out that Trump has ordered U.S. forces to leave , \u201d Mr. Barak said in an interview with Israel Army Radio .\nImmediately after the attack on Mr. Soleimani , Iraq \u2019 s parliament voted to order the U.S. military to leave its soil . If the U.S. were to exit Iraq in the aftermath of the killing , it would mark a backfiring of extraordinary strategic consequences , says Ambassador Shapiro and others .\n\u201c I don \u2019 t rule out that , paradoxically , [ the attack ] will result in the U.S. retreating from Iraq , \u201d says Mr. Herzog . \u201c The president could say , \u2018 We targeted Soleimani , [ so ] we can leave. \u2019 If the U.S. government decides to leave Iraq ... there \u2019 s going to be a domino effect . \u201d\nBeyond confusion about the strategic direction of Washington in the Middle East , there are serious Israeli misgivings about the machinery of U.S. policy .\nGiven the turnover among the Trump administration \u2019 s senior ranks and attrition among career policymakers in executive branch bureaucracies , there are questions about whether the administration has the ability to handle a serious crisis .\n\u201c On the face of it , it doesn \u2019 t seem to be an ideal administration to deal with such a problem , \u2019 \u2019 says Ephraim Halevy , a former director of the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad .\n\u201c The decision-making process is problematic .
