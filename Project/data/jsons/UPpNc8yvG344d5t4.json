    "content": "Washington ( CNN ) President Donald Trump is showing what happens when the United States abandons its decades-long role as a guarantor of stability and instead chooses to act as an agent of global disruption .\nA series of economic and political shocks are fomenting disorder across the planet and straining an international political system that Trump deliberately set out to undermine .\nTrump did not cause all these crises . But his actions or unwillingness to temper them did deepen the discord in many cases . And his refusal to play the kind of stabilizing leadership role expected of a US president is fomenting power vacuums and may convince key protagonists in each drama that they may not face the kinds of consequences they might normally expect from Washington .\nThe President 's worldview is rooted in his enduring belief that the world has been ripping America off for generations and that strength and unilateral US action are the only way to restore respect . He believes engagement abroad inevitably leads to costly commitments and bloody disasters like the Iraq War .\nBut Trump 's foreign policy achievements -- apart from piling up glowing flattery by leaders intent on exploiting his craving for praise -- are questionable at best . He can claim to have finished an operation started in the Obama administration to stamp out ISIS . And there is a recognition in Washington that China 's economic policies needed to be challenged . But the US and the rest of the world are learning the price of an improvisational approach shaped largely to satisfy Trump 's domestic political requirements that often seems strategized only in the time it takes to commit it to Twitter .\nWednesday 's grim economic news made the risks of such an approach clearer than ever , raising the possibility that Trump 's mission to turn the world upside down could blow up in his face .\nJUST WATCHED Why you 'll feel the latest round of tariffs Replay More Videos ...
