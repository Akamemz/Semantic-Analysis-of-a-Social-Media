    "content": "Facebook detailed a new plan Thursday to target the rapid spread of fake news across its site , a phenomenon that received renewed attention in the weeks following the 2016 election , with accusations that it may have influenced the behavior of voters .\nThe problem reached a breaking point two weeks ago when a gunman entered a pizza restaurant in Washington , D.C. , to investigate an internet-based conspiracy theory about a child-sex ring that does not exist .\nNow the move from the internet \u2019 s largest social-media platform has some intentional fake-news writers , who created their websites to \u201c satirize \u201d right-wing conspiracies or exploit Facebook \u2019 s algorithm , believing they \u2019 ll soon be out of business .\nBut the new program also has conspiracy theorists , ones who believe Hillary Clinton \u2019 s fictitious ties to the occult are the \u201c real news , \u201d excitedly drawing battle lines over the future of the news on social media .\nShould Facebook \u2019 s fact-check initiative take off and result in censorship of propagandist sites , editors at websites like Infowars and alt-right leaders insist it will only reinforce the belief that certain ideas are being suppressed in favor of facts from mainstream outlets . One editor told The \u2588\u2588\u2588 the Facebook plan proves that now the \u201c \u2018 Infowar \u2019 isn \u2019 t a clich\u00e9 , it \u2019 s perfectly apt . \u201d\nIf Facebook \u2019 s experiment is applied correctly , authors of intentionally fake news face a potential hurdle for generating advertising revenue for their sites , if not the banning of their stories from the social network outright .\nMarco Chacon , the creator of the intentional fake news website RealTrueNews.org , says Facebook is finally taking a positive step toward making sure websites like his no longer go viral on the social network .
