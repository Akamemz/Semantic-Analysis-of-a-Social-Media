    "content": "For months , FBI agent Peter Strzok has had a starring role in President Donald Trump \u2019 s preferred narrative that the Russia investigation is a deep-state witch hunt that \u2019 s biased against him .\nBut on Thursday , Strzok testified for hours at a congressional hearing and gave his side of the story for the first time \u2014 and what a hearing it was . ( Actually , as of press time it \u2019 s still going on , over nine hours after it started . )\nIn a raucous , partisan , circus-like atmosphere , Strzok repeatedly claimed that his personal political views \u2014 expressed in thousands of texts sent to his coworker and lover , Lisa Page \u2014 never affected any of his decisions in either the Hillary Clinton email investigation or the Trump-Russia probe ( until special counsel Robert Mueller removed him from it last summer ) .\nStrzok insisted that if he really wanted to stop Trump from winning , he could have leaked information about the Russia probe to the press \u2014 but that he didn \u2019 t . He also emphasized that there were \u201c multiple layers \u201d of officials above and below him at every key moment , who would not have tolerated bias . And he maintained that no one has pointed out any one action that he took as part of his job that was driven by bias .\nHe also defended the investigation as serious and important . \u201c The information we had which was alleging a Russian offer of assistance to a member of the Trump campaign was of extraordinary significance , \u201d he said . \u201c It was credible . It was from an extraordinarily sensitive and credible source . \u201d\nMeanwhile , Republicans contemptuously scorned Strzok \u2019 s claims to professionalism , repeatedly quoting from his more inflammatory text messages in an attempt to impugn the investigation . Democrats , meanwhile , became Strzok \u2019 s defenders \u2014 even though he was sharply criticized in an inspector general report last month , and removed from Mueller \u2019 s team . \u201c If I could give you a Purple Heart , I would . You deserve one , \u201d Rep. Steve Cohen ( D-TN ) said .\nThe hearing was a remarkable spectacle , devolving several times into dueling partisan choruses of shouts . One Republican brought up Strzok \u2019 s extramarital affair , while Democratic staffers held up posters showing Michael Flynn and others who have pleaded guilty in Mueller \u2019 s probe .\nWhat the hearing didn \u2019 t do , though , was reveal much new about that Russia probe . Even though Strzok left Mueller \u2019 s team nearly a year ago , he repeatedly refused to answer questions about the specifics of the still-ongoing investigation , because the FBI \u2019 s lawyers had urged him not to . Instead , Strzok \u2019 s goal was to rehabilitate his own reputation \u2014 while Republicans \u2019 goal was to rake him over the coals .\nAfter an FBI career of over two decades , Strzok became the lead agent on the bureau \u2019 s counterespionage team . It was there that he had a major role in , first , the Hillary Clinton email investigation , and second , the counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign \u2019 s ties to Russia . After special counsel Robert Mueller \u2019 s took over the Russia probe in May 2017 , Strzok served on his team too .\nStrzok was a highly regarded agent with a very good reputation \u2014 but he had a secret . Through much of this time , he \u2019 d been having an affair with a co-worker : Lisa Page , who worked for then-deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe , and was briefly assigned to Mueller \u2019 s probe too . ( Both Strzok and Page are married to other people . )\nOn their work devices , Strzok and Page exchanged thousands of texts in which they frequently discussed investigations they were both involved in \u2014 and also shared their views on politics in general . And it turns out that neither were fans of Trump \u2014 in fact , they were appalled by him , and repeatedly said so . ( You can read the publicly released texts here . )\nFBI officials are of course allowed to have their own opinions about politics , though writing them out on work devices and intermingling them with discussions of the sensitive investigations involving those political figures doesn \u2019 t really look great .\nYet some of Strzok \u2019 s texts arguably have more troubling implications . Particularly , in one late-night exchange from early August 2016 , Page expresses fear that Trump will win the presidency , and Strzok answers \u201c No . No he won \u2019 t . We \u2019 ll stop it. \u201d If by \u201c we \u201d Strzok meant the FBI \u2014 which had opened its investigation into the Trump campaign \u2019 s Russia ties just over a week earlier \u2014 that poses the question of whether Strzok hoped to impact the election through his work .\nAll this became a problem for Strzok last summer , when Justice Department inspector general Michael Horowitz , who was reviewing FBI leaks and the bureau \u2019 s handling of the Clinton email probe , discovered the texts . Horowitz informed Mueller of what they said \u2014 and Mueller was sufficiently disturbed that he removed Strzok from his team immediately . ( Page had already left Mueller \u2019 s team at that point . )\nSo in a punishment worthy of The Wire , the agent who \u2019 d worked on some of the most important investigations in the country was transferred to the human resources division of the FBI . There he worked for a quiet few months \u2014 until word of the texting FBI lovers and his removal from Mueller \u2019 s team leaked out in December 2017 , and the story became a media sensation .\nWhat do Strzok \u2019 s texts say about Trump , Clinton , and politics ?\nLike much of the rest of America , Strzok and Page closely followed the 2016 presidential campaign . Late at night , they exchanged texts about debates , conventions , and whatever the latest political events happened to be .\nAnd they weren \u2019 t pure partisans . They expressed their contempt for many political figures from both parties , including Bernie Sanders , Eric Holder , Chelsea Clinton , and various members of Congress . More rarely , they praised some politicians , like Joe Biden and John Kasich . At one point Strzok wrote that he was \u201c a conservative Dem. \u201d About Obama , he wrote , \u201c I like him . Just not a fan of the weakness globally . \u201d\nBut it \u2019 s inarguable that Strzok and Page were particularly appalled by Trump and his candidacy . Strzok wrote that Trump was a \u201c douche , \u201d a \u201c loathsome human , \u201d and that the prospect of Trump winning was \u201c F * CKING TERRIFYING. \u201d Opinions like these , it should be noted , were shared by much of even the Republican establishment at the time .\nHowever , in August 2016 , shortly after the FBI opened its counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign \u2019 s Russia ties , there are a few exchanges that Republicans say raise red flags about whether Strzok and Page \u2019 s political views affected their work \u2014 two in particular .\nOn August 9 , Page wrote , \u201c He \u2019 s not ever going to become president , right ? \u201d Strzok answered : \u201c No . No he won \u2019 t . We \u2019 ll stop it. \u201d On August 15 , Strzok wrote , \u201c I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy \u2019 s office - that there \u2019 s no way he gets elected - but I \u2019 m afraid we can \u2019 t take that risk . It \u2019 s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you \u2019 re 40\u2026 \u201d\nHowever , Strzok has suggested that both exchanges are being misinterpreted . Strzok suggested Thursday that \u201c we \u2019 ll stop \u201d meant that the American electorate ( not the FBI ) would stop Trump from winning , by voting against him .\nAs for the \u201c insurance policy \u201d text , Strzok said that there was an internal FBI debate over whether to move forward with the Trump-Russia probe even if that could jeopardize \u201c an extraordinarily sensitive source , \u201d or whether to slow-walk the investigation under the assumption that Trump was sure to lose , so it wouldn \u2019 t mean much . He says the \u201c insurance policy \u201d simply meant proceeding with the investigation just in case Trump won \u2014 not trying to affirmatively stop Trump from winning .\nDo Strzok \u2019 s texts mean the FBI was biased against Trump ?\nEven before the story of the texting FBI lovers leaked out , Trump and his allies ( who include key GOP congressional committee chairs ) were engaged in a larger effort to discredit the Russia investigation\u2014 by alleging supposed wrongdoing by the Justice Department , FBI , or Obama administration officials .\nThis effort included , among other things , Trump \u2019 s phony allegation that President Obama \u201c tapped \u201d his phones ( which Rep. Devin Nunes tried to turn into the \u201c unmasking \u201d pseudo-scandal ) , as well as months of inquiries about how the FBI used the explosive Steele dossier that alleged Trump-Russia ties .\nSo naturally , Trump has for months tried to use the Strzok-Page texts to discredit the whole Mueller probe , accusing it of being tainted by Strzok \u2019 s bias :\nIn one of the biggest stories in a long time , the FBI now says it is missing five months worth of lovers Strzok-Page texts , perhaps 50,000 , and all in prime time . Wow ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) January 23 , 2018\nWhy was the FBI \u2019 s sick loser , Peter Strzok , working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats , when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover , lawyer Lisa Page , that \u201c we \u2019 ll stop \u201d Trump from becoming President ? Witch Hunt ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) June 18 , 2018\nHow can the Rigged Witch Hunt proceed when it was started , influenced and worked on , for an extended period of time , by former FBI Agent/Lover Peter Strzok ? Read his hate filled and totally biased Emails and the answer is clear ! \u2014 Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) July 11 , 2018\nThat was the context for the performance of most House Republicans at Thursday \u2019 s hearing . They argued that Strzok \u2019 s political views meant he would have pushed to let Hillary Clinton off easy on the email investigation in early 2016 , while trying to \u201c get \u201d Trump with the Russia investigation .\nHere \u2019 s the problem \u2014 at least so far , no one can point to anything specific Strzok actually did to try to help Clinton win or hurt Trump , either in the Clinton probe or the Russia investigation .\nNow , many of the key Russia probe decisions from this time period still remain secret , and the FBI told Strzok not to answer questions about them at Thursday \u2019 s hearing . However , a fuller read of the texts do make clear that Strzok really did take the threat of Russian interference in the election seriously , and wasn \u2019 t just contriving it to hurt Trump ( \u201c f * cking conniving cheating savages . At statecraft , athletics , you name it , \u201d he wrote ) .\nWhen it comes to the Clinton probe , DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz published his extensive review of the FBI \u2019 s handling of that controversial investigation last month . He wrote that , though he was concerned about Strzok \u2019 s potential bias and thought he hurt the FBI \u2019 s reputation , he couldn \u2019 t actually find evidence of bias affecting his actual investigative decisions .\nHorowitz wrote that \u201c Strzok was not the sole decisionmaker \u201d for the key Clinton email probe decisions he reviewed and that in fact Strzok and Page sometimes \u201c advocated for more aggressive investigative measures . \u201d\nHorowitz did write that he didn \u2019 t \u201c have confidence \u201d that one Strzok decision \u2014 to prioritize the Trump-Russia probe over reviewing new Clinton emails on Anthony Weiner \u2019 s laptop \u2014 \u201c was free from bias. \u201d But he also couldn \u2019 t show that there was bias there . ( After all , there are legitimate arguments that pursuing active Russian interference in the final weeks of the election was the right call , and the new Clinton emails turned out to be unimportant when they were reviewed . )\nMore broadly , we should keep in mind that Strzok was being supervised all along by FBI counterintelligence chief Bill Priestap ( \u201c for whom , \u201d Horowitz wrote , \u201c we found no evidence of bias \u201d ) . Meanwhile , the FBI was run by James Comey , who \u2019 d been a registered Republican for many years , and whose high-profile actions in 2016 were accused of damaging Hillary Clinton \u2019 s chances .\nThursday \u2019 s joint hearing of the House Oversight Committee and House Judiciary Committee was notable for two main reasons \u2014 first , because Strzok defended himself publicly for the first time , and second , because of the over-the-top nasty partisan theatrics that took place .\nStrzok was an articulate witness , arguing that he was a consummate professional who would never let his political views impact his work , and that his FBI colleagues were similarly professional .\n\u201c At no time in any of these texts did those personal beliefs ever enter into the realm of any action I took , \u201d he said . \u201c You don \u2019 t have to take my word for it . At every step , at every investigative decision , there were multiple layers of people above me ... and multiple layers of people below me . \u201d\nHe pointed out that he could have leaked information to hurt Trump \u2019 s chances of winning , but said that possibility \u201c never crossed my mind. \u201d Sometimes , he suggested that even though the FBI wouldn \u2019 t let him answer certain questions ( for instance , about the Steele dossier ) , those answers wouldn \u2019 t be as scandalous as Republicans were hoping for \u2014 \u201c I would very much love to answer that , \u201d he said .\nAs for the \u201c we \u2019 ll stop it \u201d text , Strzok said that it was sent in the days after controversy over Trump \u2019 s attacks on Khizr Khan , the Democratic Convention speaker and the father of an army captain who was killed in Iraq \u2014 and Strzok even reiterated that Trump \u2019 s behavior there was \u201c horrible and disgusting . \u201d\nIn terms of the texts that \u201c we will stop \u201d it , you need to understand that that was written late at night off the cuff and it was in response to a series of events that included then-candidate Trump insulting the immigrant family of a fallen war hero and my presumption , based on that horrible , disgusting behavior , that the American population would not elect someone demonstrating that behavior to be president of the United States . It was in no way unequivocally any suggestion that me , the FBI , would take any action whatsoever to improperly impact the electoral process for any candidate ...\nAgain and again , Strzok returned to the argument that no one has demonstrated that any one of his investigative actions was biased .\nThursday \u2019 s hearing came just two weeks after the same members of Congress interviewed Strzok for nearly 11 hours in private \u2014 so for them , it wasn \u2019 t really about finding new information . Instead , it was a carnival for public consumption .\nWhile Rep. Elijah Cummings ( D-MD ) gave his opening statement , Democratic staff members held up large pictures of all five people who had pleaded guilty in Mueller \u2019 s probe so far , with the word \u201c GUILTY \u201d emblazoned on each .\nRep. Trey Gowdy ( R-SC ) opened the questioning by asking Strzok how many witnesses he \u2019 d interviewed in the early days of the Russia probe . But the FBI had advised Strzok not to answer questions about that investigation , so Strzok said he wouldn \u2019 t answer .\nAfter a lengthy back-and-forth in which Republicans threatened to hold Strzok in contempt of Congress and outraged Democrats objected and tried to disrupt the proceedings , Gowdy said he already knew the answer the question anyway ( zero ) . So the whole thing just seemed designed to put Strzok in an impossible position , toward no particular end .\nThen , Democrats complained that when former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon was interviewed by the committee , he had similarly stonewalled questions because he said the White House didn \u2019 t want him to answer \u2014 but Republicans seem not to care about that . They briefly postponed the hearing to hold a recorded vote on the matter , which went down on party lines .\nThe proceedings hit a nadir when Rep. Louie Gohmert ( R-TX ) asked Strzok , \u201c How many times did you look so innocent into your wife \u2019 s eye and lie to her ? \u201d Democrats shouted to interrupt him , with one yelling , \u201c You need your medication ! \u201d\nThursday \u2019 s circus of a hearing comes amid increasing attacks from Trump and leading House Republicans on the investigation and the Department of Justice .\nKey GOP House committee chairs \u2014 Devin Nunes , Bob Goodlatte , and Trey Gowdy \u2014 have for months been sending subpoenas flying , trying to get a hold of documents related to the probe .\nPublicly , they say all this is about oversight , and making sure the executive branch didn \u2019 t abuse its power in investigating the Trump campaign . But Democratic critics argue that they are merely trying to do the president \u2019 s bidding , by digging for information Trump can use to publicly attack the investigation .\nIndeed , despite the occasional chatter that Trump might fire Mueller or Rosenstein , for the time being he \u2019 s preferred to attack them in the court of public opinion . And it \u2019 s been a relatively effective strategy so far . Polls show Mueller \u2019 s favorability has been dropping , with Republicans increasingly disapproving of the investigation .\nBut all the while , Mueller has remained in place , with his team continuing to do its work .",

(After all, there are legitimate arguments that pursuing active Russian interference in the final weeks of the election was the right call, and the new Clinton emails turned out to be unimportant when they were reviewed.)\n\nMore broadly, we should keep in mind that Strzok was being supervised all along by FBI counterintelligence chief Bill Priestap (\u201cfor whom,\u201d Horowitz wrote, \u201cwe found no evidence of bias\u201d). Meanwhile, the FBI was run by James Comey, who\u2019d been a registered Republican for many years, and whose high-profile actions in 2016 were accused of damaging Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances.\n\nWhat did Strzok say at the hearing?\n\nThursday\u2019s joint hearing of the House Oversight Committee and House Judiciary Committee was notable for two main reasons \u2014 first, because Strzok defended himself publicly for the first time, and second, because of the over-the-top nasty partisan theatrics that took place.\n\nStrzok was an articulate witness, arguing that he was a consummate professional who would never let his political views impact his work, and that his FBI colleagues were similarly professional.\n\n\u201cAt no time in any of these texts did those personal beliefs ever enter into the realm of any action I took,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to take my word for it. At every step, at every investigative decision, there were multiple layers of people above me ... and multiple layers of people below me.\u201d\n\nHe pointed out that he could have leaked information to hurt Trump\u2019s chances of winning, but said that possibility \u201cnever crossed my mind.\u201d Sometimes, he suggested that even though the FBI wouldn\u2019t let him answer certain questions (for instance, about the Steele dossier), those answers wouldn\u2019t be as scandalous as Republicans were hoping for \u2014 \u201cI would very much love to answer that,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for the \u201cwe\u2019ll stop it\u201d text, Strzok said that it was sent in the days after controversy over Trump\u2019s attacks on Khizr Khan, the Democratic Convention speaker and the father of an army captain who was killed in Iraq \u2014 and Strzok even reiterated that Trump\u2019s behavior there was \u201chorrible and disgusting.\u201d\n\nIn terms of the texts that \u201cwe will stop\u201d it, you need to understand that that was written late at night off the cuff and it was in response to a series of events that included then-candidate Trump insulting the immigrant family of a fallen war hero and my presumption, based on that horrible, disgusting behavior, that the American population would not elect someone demonstrating that behavior to be president of the United States. It was in no way unequivocally any suggestion that me, the FBI, would take any action whatsoever to improperly impact the electoral process for any candidate ...\n\nAgain and again, Strzok returned to the argument that no one has demonstrated that any one of his investigative actions was biased.\n\nWhy was the hearing so out of control?\n\nThursday\u2019s hearing came just two weeks after the same members of Congress interviewed Strzok for nearly 11 hours in private \u2014 so for them, it wasn\u2019t really about finding new information. Instead, it was a carnival for public consumption.\n\nWhile Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) gave his opening statement, Democratic staff members held up large pictures of all five people who had pleaded guilty in Mueller\u2019s probe so far, with the word \u201cGUILTY\u201d emblazoned on each.\n\nRep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) opened the questioning by asking Strzok how many witnesses he\u2019d interviewed in the early days of the Russia probe. But the FBI had advised Strzok not to answer questions about that investigation, so Strzok said he wouldn\u2019t answer.\n\nAfter a lengthy back-and-forth in which Republicans threatened to hold Strzok in contempt of Congress and outraged Democrats objected and tried to disrupt the proceedings, Gowdy said he already knew the answer the question anyway (zero). So the whole thing just seemed designed to put Strzok in an impossible position, toward no particular end.\n\nThen, Democrats complained that when former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon was interviewed by the committee, he had similarly stonewalled questions because he said the White House didn\u2019t want him to answer \u2014 but Republicans seem not to care about that. They briefly postponed the hearing to hold a recorded vote on the matter, which went down on party lines.\n\nThe proceedings hit a nadir when Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) asked Strzok, \u201cHow many times did you look so innocent into your wife\u2019s eye and lie to her?\u201d Democrats shouted to interrupt him, with one yelling, \u201cYou need your medication!\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nThursday\u2019s circus of a hearing comes amid increasing attacks from Trump and leading House Republicans on the investigation and the Department of Justice.\n\nKey GOP House committee chairs \u2014 Devin Nunes, Bob Goodlatte, and Trey Gowdy \u2014 have for months been sending subpoenas flying, trying to get a hold of documents related to the probe.\n\nPublicly, they say all this is about oversight, and making sure the executive branch didn\u2019t abuse its power in investigating the Trump campaign. But Democratic critics argue that they are merely trying to do the president\u2019s bidding, by digging for information Trump can use to publicly attack the investigation.\n\nIndeed, despite the occasional chatter that Trump might fire Mueller or Rosenstein, for the time being he\u2019s preferred to attack them in the court of public opinion. And it\u2019s been a relatively effective strategy so far. Polls show Mueller\u2019s favorability has been dropping, with Republicans increasingly disapproving of the investigation.\n\nBut all the while, Mueller has remained in place, with his team continuing to do its work.",
