    "content": "( CNN Business ) Earlier this spring , as some Americans increasingly tired of stay-at-home orders during the pandemic , groups began cropping up on Facebook demanding that state officials reopen the economy . Some of these groups , which researchers say total in the hundreds on Facebook , echoed rhetoric by President Donald Trump and quickly gained a massive following , in some cases adding thousands of members a day .\nBut even after all 50 states have moved to reopen their economies in recent weeks , engagement within these Facebook groups remains high .
