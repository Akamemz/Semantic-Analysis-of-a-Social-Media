Korea says it \u2019 s willing to talk to U.S. \u2018 at any time , at any format \u2019 The statement came in response to President Donald Trump \u2019 s cancellation of a historic summit with Kim Jong Un planned for next month .\nNorth Korea signaled its willingness to engage in talks with the United States \u201c at any time , at any format , \u201d just hours after President Donald Trump on Thursday canceled his planned summit with Kim Jong Un and scolded the North Korean leader in a letter for \u201c tremendous anger and open hostility \u201d while bluntly reminding Kim of the United States \u2019 nuclear prowess .\nKim Kye Gwan , first vice minister of foreign affairs , issued a statement on Friday , local time , saying the North was \u201c willing to give the U.S. time and opportunities \u201d to reconsider talks , The Associated Press reported . He added that his country \u2019 s \u201c objective and resolve to do our best for the sake of peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula and all humankind remain unchanged . \u201d\nThe conciliatory language stood in contrast to a statement , made overnight Wednesday , in which another vice minister of foreign affairs , Choe Son Hui , warned that Pyongyang could \u201c make the U.S. taste an appalling tragedy it has neither experienced nor even imagined . \u201d\nTrump wrote in his letter to Kim Jong Un : \u201c Sadly , based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement , I feel it is inappropriate , at this time , to have this long-planned meeting . \u201d\nThe scuttling of the summit , which had been scheduled for June 12 in Singapore , is a blow to U.S. efforts to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons , as well as Trump \u2019 s desire to land a legacy-making deal with the hermetic nation .\nDespite the North \u2019 s recent softer tone , the cancellation also raises the risk of conflict in East Asia and has rattled U.S. allies South Korea and Japan .\nTrump and his aides sought to pin the blame for the canceled meeting entirely on North Korea . During a televised public address midday Thursday from the White House 's Roosevelt Room , Trump directly linked the decision to recent inflammatory remarks made by North Korean officials .\nBreaking News Alerts Get breaking news when it happens \u2014 in your inbox .

Bolton had suggested that the U.S. wanted to pursue a nuclear deal with North Korea similar to the one it struck with Libyan dictator Muammar Qadhafi in the early 2000s . But North Korea took that as a negative sign because Qadhafi was ousted and killed several years after giving up his nuclear program .\nA senior White House official said the statement was simply the latest in a \u201c trail of broken promises \u201c that led Trump to abandon the talks . Last week , North Korean officials failed to show up in Singapore for a series of meetings to lay the groundwork for the presidential summit , the official said , declaring : \u201c They simply stood us up. \u201c\nIn recent days , the North Koreans have also been unresponsive to U.S. attempts to reach them . \u201c We simply couldn \u2019 t get them to pick up the phone , \u201c the official said . In addition , the North Korean government did not keep its promise to invite experts to observe what it has said was the closure of one of its nuclear test sites , casting doubt on what really happened , the official said .\nPyongyang exhibited \u201c a profound lack of good faith , \u201c said the official , who sidestepped questions on the role that Bolton \u2018 s and Pence 's comments may have played .\nResponding to the cancellation , South Korea \u2019 s president , Moon Jae-in , urged the leaders of the United States and North Korea to talk directly to each other .\n\u201c Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the establishment of permanent peace are historic tasks that can neither be abandoned nor delayed , \u201c Moon said in an emergency meeting with his top security officials at his office on Friday , according to South Korea \u2019 s Yonhap News Agency .\nTrump was briefed on North Korea \u2018 s harsh statement on Wednesday night , and slept on the matter before deciding on Thursday morning to call off the summit , according to the White House official . In his letter \u2014 which was released publicly Thursday morning and , according to a senior White House official , was dictated entirely by the president \u2014 Trump made sure to remind North Korea of the United States ' formidable nuclear arsenal , hearkening back to when the president boasted that his nuclear button was \u201c bigger and more powerful \u201c than Kim \u2018 s .\n\u201c You talk about your nuclear capabilities , but ours are so massive and powerful that I pray to God they will never have to be used , \u201c Trump wrote .\nTrump , however , also thanked Kim for the \u201c wonderful dialogue \u201d that had developed in recent weeks between the two nations while leaving the door open to a rescheduled summit in the future .\n\u201c If you change your mind having to do with this most important summit , please do not hesitate to call me or write , \u201d the president said . \u201c The world , and North Korea in particular , has lost a great opportunity for lasting peace and great prosperity and wealth . \u201d\nHe added : \u201c This missed opportunity is a truly sad moment in history . \u201d\nThe president , later delivering remarks alongside Pence and other administration officials prior to the signing of a financial reform bill , even broached the possibility of the summit resuming as originally scheduled . \u201c It \u2018 s possible that the existing summit could take place , or a summit at some later date , \u201c he said .\nThe letter \u2018 s stunning reversal came after the president suggested earlier this week that plans for the meeting might be delayed amid renewed tension with the North Korean government , which last week criticized the U.S. for engaging in joint military exercises with South Korea and appeared to back away from their pledge to discuss de-nuclearization .\nTrump on Tuesday declared that \u201c it may not work out for June 12 \u201d regarding the planned meeting in Singapore between him and Kim . The president on Wednesday said a decision would be made \u201c next week \u201c about whether the summit would go on as scheduled , amid reports that high-level U.S. and North Korean officials were set to hold a pivotal planning meeting over the weekend in Singapore .\nTestifying before lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Thursday , Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said North Korean officials had failed to respond to inquiries from the U.S. about gathering `` preparation teams '' ahead of the summit . \u201c We had received no response to our inquiries from them , \u201c he said . Pompeo , who helped launch negotiations with North Korea with a secretive visit to Pyongyang earlier this year , told legislators that he was involved in crafting the president \u2018 s letter , but that the cancellation decision ultimately fell to Trump .\nTrump has long insisted that efforts to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula be at the center of discussions with Kim , and has appeared to revel in the idea that he could receive a Nobel Peace Prize . But the North has said it has no interest in a summit if the U.S. demands \u201c unilateral nuclear abandonment . \u201d\nNorth Korea \u2018 s deputy foreign minister , Kim Kye-gwan , warned on May 16 that North Korea might pull back from talks , noting that a setback would prove deeply damaging to Trump \u2019 s legacy .\n\u201c If President Trump follows in the footsteps of his predecessors , he will be recorded as a more tragic and unsuccessful president than his predecessors , far from his initial ambition to make unprecedented success , \u201d the North Korean official said in a statement .\nThe remarks marked a return to a more combative posture toward the U.S. for North Korea , whose leader traded public taunts and threats of nuclear strikes with Trump prior to a thawing of relations earlier this year .\nA senior administration official called it a \u201c wise \u201d decision for Trump \u201c to walk away for time being , \u201d noting that \u201c the U.S. conceded nothing to the North Koreans \u201d in negotiations .\nCongressional Republicans voiced support for the president \u2019 s decision to scrap the summit . House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( R-Calif. ) told reporters Thursday that Trump was \u201c right \u201d to cancel the meeting , adding , \u201c I trust his judgment going forward . \u201d\nI have decided to terminate the planned Summit in Singapore on June 12th .

Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) May 24 , 2018\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan ( R-Wis. ) said in a statement that \u201c North Korea has long given ample reason to question its commitment to stability . \u201d\n\u201c The U.S. must not relent in this maximum pressure campaign as we continue to work with our allies toward a peaceful resolution \u201d on North Korea , Ryan added .\nBut Democratic lawmakers argued the cancellation signaled that the White House had failed to properly prepare for the summit .\n\u201c The art of diplomacy is a lot harder than the art of the deal , \u201c Sen. Bob Menendez ( D-N.J. ) , ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , wrote on Twitter . \u201c It \u2018 s amazing to me that the administration is somehow shocked the North Koreans are acting as North Koreans act. \u201c\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer tweeted in response to the development : \u201c Many of us feared that the summit between @ POTUS & Kim Jong-Un would be a great show that produced nothing enduring . If a summit is to be reconstituted , the US must show strength & achieve a concrete , verifiable , enduring elimination of Kim Jong-Un \u2019 s nuclear capabilities. \u201c\nThe cancellation is also a blow to South Korea and Japan , two U.S. allies even more exposed to the North Korean threat than the United States .\nAhead of the summit , the two countries had been nudging the United States to ensure that any agreement with Kim takes into account their security concerns , which aren \u2019 t just about North Korea \u2019 s nuclear weapons but also its conventional military abilities .\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in , in particular , had worked hard to engage Pyongyang and was especially supportive of a Trump-Kim summit . Yet the head of state appeared to be blindsided by Trump \u2019 s decision on Thursday .\n\u201c I am very perplexed , and it is very regrettable that the North Korea-U.S. summit will not be held on June 12 when it was scheduled to be held , \u201c Moon said at an emergency meeting with security officials , according to the Seoul-based Yonhap News Agency . The South Korean leader urged U.S. and North Korean officials to quickly restart talks .\nThe cancellation also drew scrutiny from other foreign officials , with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres saying Thursday that he was `` deeply concerned '' by the withdrawal . He called on Trump and Kim `` to find a path to the peaceful and verifiable denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula . ''\nVictor Cha , who was Trump \u2018 s pick to be U.S. ambassador to South Korea until his name was removed from consideration in January , told \u2588\u2588\u2588 that the summit 's cancellation is a \u201c very unfortunate outcome. \u201c\n\u201c The question is \u2014 are we now more or less secure as a nation as a result of the cancellation of this summit ? \u201c Cha said . \u201c I think Trump saw too much uncertainty with a summit for there to be worth going forward , even with his own penchant for gut instincts and winging it. \u201c",
