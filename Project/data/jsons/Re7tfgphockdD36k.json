We \u2019 re getting nothing done. \u201d It was a few days before the historic Obamacare repeal vote , and Republicans desperately needed John McCain . \u201c It was a dramatic and consequential return for John McCain to the Senate floor. \u201d \u201c What a dramatic morning this is turning out to be , with John McCain making that surprise return to Washington. \u201d \u201c And McCain \u2019 s vote is going to give leadership a lot more breathing room. \u201d But the maverick of the Senate had just been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer , and he was playing hard to get . \u201c We \u2019 ve been spinning our wheels on too many important issues , because we keep trying to find a way to win without help from across the aisle. \u201d But would he vote with his party , or would he defect ? \u201c I will not vote for this bill as it is today. \u201d This was the kind of moment that John McCain lives for . He is going to be the deciding vote , and he \u2019 s got control of a major piece of legislation in his hand . \u201c You heard John McCain . A really historic moment . Trying to set a new tone when it comes to fixing our health care system. \u201d When you go against the grain in Washington , you get a lot of attention . \u201c Shutting down the government injured the people of my state . Why ? Why would we want to do that ? \u201d John McCain had a big ego , and he liked the attention . But also , I do think that the maverick aspect to McCain was real . He saw a lot of the things that went on in Washington as semi-idiotic , or corrupt . \u201c I think the Congress of the United States \u2014 both Republicans and Democrats \u2014 should be ashamed of themselves . These may be worthy projects . They may be . Generally they aren \u2019 t . How many more lawmakers , staffers , government officials , and contractors have to go to jail before we actually fix this process ? \u201d He liked challenging authority . It may be part of that is just growing up in a military family and having all that military experience , where you \u2019 re subject to so much authority . \u201c I have trouble with this . More than two-syllable words \u2014 \u201d In the political phase of his life , he was willing to step up , take a chance , and shake up the system . \u201c Eleven million people live in the shadows , and they live here in de facto amnesty , and , by God , they are being exploited every single day. \u201d Of course , he switched back and forth when it suited his politics . \u201c We will secure the borders first when I am president of the United States . I am proud that Republicans are the party of lower taxes . I can not in good conscience vote in favor of tax cuts. \u201d There have been so many John McCains over the years . He came to Congress as this exalted war hero who \u2019 d already had a national reputation because of his time as a P.O.W . in Vietnam . McCain was shot down , held for years in terrible conditions in the Hanoi Hilton . He had a high profile because of his father . \u201c The commander in chief of our Pacific forces , Admiral John S. McCain Jr. \u201d \u201c As you know , we are living in a troubled world \u2014 \u201d They knew that they had something of a celebrity prisoner there . He was tortured , subjected to really unthinkable experiences . He resisted and resisted , but ultimately did make a confession . That really haunted him through the rest of his life . He felt that he had caved and betrayed his country . When he returned from Vietnam , to much acclaim , he was an ambitious guy , and he quickly turned to politics . \u201c John McCain , a name Arizonans are talking about. \u201d He ran for the House . Came in as a pretty conventional conservative \u2014 somebody who wanted to get on board the Reagan Revolution . \u201c Speaker , like a poor fellow who brought his horse to water but could not make it drink , Walter Mondale proposes to throw more tax money at the deficit with little chance of making it shrink. \u201d But there was a watershed moment coming for John McCain \u2014 \u201c \u2014 a major congressional scandal \u2014 \u201d The Keating Five Scandal . \u201c Charles Keating , a millionaire banker who has come to embody the savings and loan scandal \u2014 \u201d A group of senators \u2014 a bipartisan group \u2014 had interceded on behalf of a big businessman , and they tried to help him out of a regulatory problem . It was a big scandal at the moment , because the S & L crisis was huge back then . \u201c Do you swear under oath to this committee you were unaware of that at the time ? \u201d McCain was ultimately cleared of any wrongdoing . \u201c But I understand why the committee made the arrangements they did. \u201d He thought it be besmirched his honor , which is probably the most important thing to John McCain besides his family , is his honor . This was a searing experience for McCain , and it really helped shape his later image as a maverick , because he immediately became someone , I think , who wanted to shake up the system and rein in the influence of money and politics . \u201c There \u2019 s too much money washing around , and this money makes good people do bad things , and bad people do worse things. \u201d John McCain was ready to do that . His party really wasn \u2019 t . They liked the campaign system the way it was , particularly Mitch McConnell . \u201c To effectively discuss issues in this country , one must have access to money. \u201d He was the leading foe of John McCain . \u201c Who do you want to be the next president of these United States ? McCain ! That \u2019 s right. \u201d So McCain had presidential ambitions . 2000 seemed like a good opportunity for him . This was the year of the famous Straight Talk Express . He was really letting it hang out in a lot of ways . \u201c If I were a tree , I would be a \u2014 \u201d \u201c If I were a tree , I would be a root . What does that mean ? I \u2019 d be glad to tell you \u2014 \u201d But he ran into a real buzzsaw with the Bush family and Karl Rove . \u201c Let me finish . Let me finish. \u201d \u201c All right , then. \u201d The Bush campaign did some really tough negative advertising . \u201c McCain \u2019 s campaign is crawling with lobbyists. \u201d \u201c His conservative hometown paper warns \u2014 It \u2019 s time the rest of the nation learns about the McCain we know. \u201d McCain was stung when he came back to the Senate , you could tell . \u201c Gentlemen \u2014 \u201d \u201c Senator John McCain , the Republican , and Senator Barack Obama , the \u2014 \u201d In 2008 , this was really John McCain \u2019 s last opportunity .
