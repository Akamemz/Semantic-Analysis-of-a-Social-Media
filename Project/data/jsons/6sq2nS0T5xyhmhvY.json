Known as DOMA , the law bars federal benefits for legally married same-sex couples , even though those same benefits are automatically given to heterosexual married couples .\nThe second same-sex marriage case to be argued in as many days , the DOMA challenge was brought by Edith Windsor , whose marriage to Thea Spyer was legal in New York . But when Spyer died , Windsor had to pay $ 363,000 in federal estate taxes that she would not have had to pay if she had been married to a man . Windsor challenged the federal law and won in the lower courts .\nThe case , however , came to the Supreme Court with a procedural twist .\nThe Obama administration , in a rare move , declined to defend the federal law and sided with Windsor on the question of constitutionality . But the administration continued to enforce the law and appealed to the Supreme Court to rule on the issue .\nAt the same time , the House Republican leadership intervened in the case to defend the law . All of this produced a dilemma for the Supreme Court . In the first hour of arguments Wednesday , the question was whether the House had any right to defend the law , and if not , was there an actual disagreement between two parties that the court could resolve .\nChief Justice John Roberts harrumphed at President Obama 's decision to enforce the law while at the same time refusing to defend it in court .\n`` I do n't see why he does n't have the courage of his convictions and execute not only the statute , but do it consistent with his view of the Constitution , rather than saying , 'Oh , we 'll wait till the Supreme Court tells us we have no choice , ' `` remarked Roberts .\nBut Justice Elena Kagan suggested that having to pay $ 363,000 in taxes is `` a classic injury .
