'' `` Why do n't you take my place on the show ? '' Walters joked .\nShe gave a spirited speech at the annual conference of the New America Foundation , insisting on the need to diminish economic inequality and to revive the American dream that hard work should produce economic mobility . `` It 's at the heart of what I believe is the basic bargain of America : No matter who you are or where you come from if you work hard and play by the rules , you will have the opportunity to build a good life for yourself and your family . ''\nAlthough the former secretary of state has not yet thrown her name into the 2016 presidential campaign , a series of seemingly negative stories that unfolded recently have the potential to actually strengthen her case for running to become president of the United States .\nOn the surface , the good news was not obvious . Many observers logically saw the news in a different light . `` As she takes clear steps toward her political future , '' wrote Maggie Haberman of Politico , `` the echoes of the old days are making the most noise right now . ''\nThe hearings on Benghazi have excited Republicans who are seeking to investigate what mistakes or wrongdoing she might have committed while serving as secretary . Her critics have also been asking why the State Department did n't designate Boko Haram , the group responsible for the kidnapping of nearly 300 Nigerian schoolgirls , as a terrorist organization .\nSen. Marco Rubio , one of the top Republican prospects , put on his teacher 's cap and said Clinton deserved an `` F '' for her leadership at the State Department . The hearings and the questions about foreign policy will serve as a reminder to Americans of the kind of tough political attacks Clinton should expect if she runs .\nThe piece in Vanity Fair written by Monica Lewinsky has also brought up memories of the nastier side of the late 1990s , when the scandal involving her relationship to the President almost brought down the Clinton administration .
