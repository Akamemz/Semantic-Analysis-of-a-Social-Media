    "content": "The internet falls into a familiar cycle almost every time a major global crisis or natural disaster occurs : Hashtags are devised , petitions are started on Change.org , and online fundraising campaigns flood social media feeds .\nJust this year , we \u2019 ve witnessed this cycle play out with the Notre Dame Cathedral fire , the political crisis in Sudan , and most recently , the weeks-long blazes that are ravaging the Amazon rainforest . The forest has been hit with a record number of fires this year : More than 74,000 fires have been reported , an 84 percent increase over the number at the same time last year .\nWell-meaning Americans have eagerly opened their wallets to nonprofit organizations and charities . On Facebook , the top six trending fundraisers are currently related to the Amazon fires and tied to advocacy groups like Amazon Watch , Rainforest Alliance , and Rainforest Foundation Norway .\n\u201c When people are faced with a tragedy they can \u2019 t personally impact , they find ways to feel like they \u2019 re doing something , \u201d says associate professor David Karpf , a researcher on digital political advocacy at George Washington University .\n\u201c There \u2019 s not a thing that a person in Ohio can do to directly contribute to the fires in the Amazon \u201d\nThat \u2019 s been the case for decades , he adds . Before the internet , people would mention a disaster to their neighbor , or donate to a local charity and wear its t-shirt to show support for a cause .\n\u201c There \u2019 s not a thing that a person in Ohio can do to directly contribute to the fires in the Amazon , \u201d Karpf says . \u201c But when you see a story like that , you \u2019 re moved to action . \u201d\nDonors generally trust that the organizations they \u2019 re giving to will use their money to ethically further the cause , says Stanford University professor Rob Reich , who has written several books on philanthropy and civil society . Still , there \u2019 s a broad assumption perpetuated by social media hashtags like # SaveTheAmazon and # ActForTheAmazon that donations will relieve climate change or curb the fires \u2019 impact .\nAccording to advocacy groups , donated funds are typically used for longer-term projects and support for indigenous communities , like research or government lobbying .\nFor example , Leonardo DiCaprio \u2019 s environmental group , Earth Alliance , said it will distribute funds among a number of local partners that work directly with the indigenous people who live in the Amazon .\nAmazon Watch , an advocacy nonprofit that has collected money through Facebook Fundraiser , says that most of its funds will be directed toward research and backing indigenous communities \u2019 advocacy efforts in Brazil . While the Amazon fires are an imminent threat , the group is working to change the \u201c destructive environmental policies \u201d put in place by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro , according to campaign director Moira Birss . The outpouring of global support during this crisis is much needed , Birss says , but she hopes that concern for the Amazon \u2019 s lands doesn \u2019 t end after the fires die down .\nAccording to the Pew Research Center , nearly three-quarters of Americans agree that \u201c social media makes people believe they \u2019 re making a difference when they really aren \u2019 t. \u201d ( Black and Latinx social media users generally thought more positively of social media activism than their white peers . )\nThe nature of these actions , even in the pre-internet era , has always been performative and self-assuring , Karpf explains . Posting about one \u2019 s support for a cause or charity requires almost no commitment and as little effort as a signature for a petition or a few donated dollars . The difference with Instagram and Twitter is that public posts and retweets are now visible for anyone to see .\nPublic spectacle , for the most part , leads to further discussion and even conflict : The best actionable ways to help \u201c save the Amazon \u201d are currently being disputed online among regular people , activists , and celebrities alike . Celebrities \u2014 the likes of DiCaprio , Mark Ruffalo , Madonna , and Kris Jenner \u2014 are airing their concerns on social media , some encouraging their fan base to donate as much as they can to verified organizations .\nFires are raging across the Amazon . We need to act today . Let 's put our power into action and support indigenous efforts to stop the fires and protect the Amazon # Act4Amazonia \u27a1\ufe0f https : //t.co/prBhb3McV4 \u2014 Mark Ruffalo ( @ MarkRuffalo ) August 25 , 2019\nIn this era of rampant misinformation , a celebrity endorsement offers an aspect of trust that people rely on when it comes to donating , Reich says .\nBut as purveyors of information , celebrities aren \u2019 t immune to the critics in their comments sections or Twitter replies . Users called them out ( and call out each other ) for not mentioning the root causes of the fires , such as the Brazilian government \u2019 s pro-business agenda , which has spurred large-scale deforestation by loggers and cattle farmers . While donations are helpful , some activists are adamantly encouraging people to eat less meat , which theoretically would slow down Brazil \u2019 s major beef-packing industry .\nOthers argue that the problem is bigger than meat : They say the fires are the cumulative fault of big agribusiness and compliant international governments , whose policies encourage displacement of indigenous people .\nI 'm tired of these `` EAT LESS MEAT '' posts in response to the agri-business-linked arsons of the Amazon .\nThe palm oil in your favorite vegan burger is possible because entire forests in Papua New Guinea were `` cleared '' and burned for the benefit of landowners . \u2014 Arrianna M. Planey ( @ Arrianna_Planey ) August 24 , 2019\nThese impassioned arguments reveal how there \u2019 s little public consensus on the best collective course of action . Still , some people are moved to donate money \u2014 to purchase the peace of mind that their dollars , when pooled together , would be a large enough sum to enact some type of change .\n\u201c I donated because I hope people running this go fund me [ sic ] can do what I can not do alone , \u201d one person commented on their $ 15 donation to Conservation International .\n\u201c Let \u2019 s do our part to fight the fires ! \u201d another wrote with a $ 25 contribution .\nViral news allows organizations to rapidly pool together donations , Reich says . But there \u2019 s a downside : The news cycle \u2019 s hyperactive pace does little to hold them accountable for the money they \u2019 ve collected . Months or even years later , people tend to forget or move on from the $ 10 or $ 50 they \u2019 d contributed .\nAs Gaby De Valle wrote previously for \u2588\u2588\u2588 , crowdfunding is a stopgap solution to systemic issues . It offers a short-term monetary fix to a problem that is typically caused by much bigger forces , from climate change to emergency health care bills .\n\u201c The first step is retweeting , \u201d says Karpf . \u201c The next is donating to a cause . But then again , we \u2019 re a bit too late on the issue of climate change. \u201d ( Environmental advocacy efforts compose around 3 percent of Americans \u2019 charitable spending habits , according to Giving USA \u2019 s 2018 report on philanthropy in the US . )\nIn this case , the sweeping Amazon fires were aggravated by record temperatures , drought , and deforestation \u2014 risk factors made worse by human activity . No amount of money can literally stop the fires ( although Bolsanaro has deployed military aircraft and troops to fight them ) , but it can help fund advocacy efforts and employ political lobbyists in Brazil and its allying nations .\n\u201c It \u2019 s impossible to ignore politics and think that you can donate money to address climate change or save the Amazon \u201d\nBrazil had dramatically curbed deforestation in 2014 through conservation measures , international aid , and changes in its soy and beef industry . Bolsonaro \u2019 s administration cut back on these environmental efforts , and the Brazilian president is flip-flopping over whether to accept a $ 22.2 million aid package from the Group of Seven nations .\n\u201c It \u2019 s impossible to ignore politics and think that you can donate money to address climate change or save the Amazon , \u201d Reich says .\nWith nearly every viral event , there are often opportunistic bad actors who are keen to capitalize on the social media-driven fervor . A number of Instagram accounts in June , for example , falsely claimed that meals would be sent to Sudan for every repost or follow they received , thereby amassing tens of thousands of followers .\nCrowdfunding sites have cracked down on malicious or false campaigns , but people still fall for them . Donors are generally not inclined to do research on the effectiveness of the charity they \u2019 re giving to , says Reich . They \u2019 re also more likely to donate if they have a personal connection to a cause or if someone they know asks them to contribute .\nThe psychology behind personal charity is complicated , Reich adds . Some people see posting about the fires as a virtue \u2014 that they \u2019 re actively advocating for a cause on their social media .
