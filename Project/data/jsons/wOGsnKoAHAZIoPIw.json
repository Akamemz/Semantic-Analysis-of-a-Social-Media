The ABC tracking poll , which Nate Silver designates as A plus , was released on Sunday , showing Clinton with a 12-point lead over Trump . That 's a bigger lead than in most other polls but the averages across the board have her percentage up by a comfortable margin that seems to be increasing .\nSilver of FiveThirtyEight.com has laid out four possible outcomes to the race at this point , with all but one featuring a Clinton win :\nA Trump win , including cases where he loses the popular vote but wins the Electoral College . A narrow Clinton win , wherein she wins the Electoral College , but wins the popular vote by 3 percentage points or less . ( Or wins the Electoral College and loses the popular vote . ) A Clinton win in the \u201c Obama zone , \u201d wherein she wins the popular vote by 4 to 7 percentage points \u2014 the margins by which President Obama won the elections in 2012 and 2008 , respectively . Clinton is all but certain to win the Electoral College if she wins the popular vote by this amount . Finally , a Clinton blowout , wherein she wins the popular vote by 8 points or more , which would almost certainly also yield a dominant performance in the Electoral College .\nFiveThirtyEight 's model , which averages polls , shows that Clinton has an 85 percent probability of winning and is currently ahead by 6.6 points .\nFor its part , The New York Times Upshot has a 92 percent probability of a Clinton win and shows see side-by-side comparisons of all the predictions . They all have Clinton with 85 percent or higher . Using its customary metaphor , the Upshot compares the chances of Clinton losing `` to the probability that an NFL kicker misses a 29-yard field goal . '' That indeed happens ( in fact , it happened on Sunday night ) so Democrats should not get complacent .\nAnd for down ballot races ? Well , there always has been a decent possibility that the Democrats would win the Senate if they retain the White House , simply because this is a cycle when Republicans are defending more seats . Still , that outcome is anything but assured , and some analysts are insisting ( without evidence ) that this year will feature lots of ticket splitting ( that is , people who vote for Clinton but also vote for a Republican incumbent senator , for example ) .\nStill , this cycle is nothing if not unpredictable , so who knows ?\nDemocrats had written off the House from the beginning : GOP gerrymandering all over the country makes it nearly impossible for Democrats to win a majority in the House until another round of redistricting after the 2020 census . Still , the possibility , however remote , is starting to be discussed .\nI estimate that Democrats must win the national popular vote by 8 % to have any chance at taking control of the House . This large margin is driven by two major factors in equal measure : gerrymandering to pack Democrats into districts , and population patterns which they pack themselves . Therefore the magic number for House Democrats is a Clinton win by 8 % . In national polls Clinton is currently ahead by 5 % ( 7 polls starting on October 10th or later ) , and Obama outperformed his 2012 polls by 3 % , so it \u2019 s not crazy to imagine .

Most observers see the huge and growing gender gap as a result of all that grossness .\nBut something else happened as well .
