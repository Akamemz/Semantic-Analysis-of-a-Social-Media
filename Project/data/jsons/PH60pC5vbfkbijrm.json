    "content": "When the news broke last night that Iranian general and top terrorist mastermind Qassem Soleimani had been killed in a US strike , my initial reactions -- beyond waiting for confirmation -- were satisfaction and trepidation . Satisfaction , because an evil man who was responsible for many thousands of deaths ( including those of at least 600 American soldiers ) has been erased from the planet . Iran is the top state sponsor of terrorism , and Soleimani was their most senior terror exporter . His despicable crimes have been punished and the patriots whose lives he stole have been avenged . This is justice . Trepidation , because Soleimani was a towering figure within Iran and among its proxies , and his death will elicit an angry , unpredictable , and perhaps desperate response . They want revenge .\nHis killing is unlike the elimination of a non-state terrorist organization 's leader , a reality that has both positive and negative implications . On the upside of the ledger , his decapitation represents a very serious blow to Iran 's malevolent regional and global designs , as Soleimani will not be replaced easily . He was seen as an indispensable figure within the regime 's power structure . On the downside , Iran 's capacity to strike back in various capacities will likely be greater and more sophisticated than the ad hoc retaliations of a terrorist group . It 's rational to fear where a series of escalations could lead , even if one approves of the righteous decision ( preceded by lots of recent context and previous escalations ) to take Soleimani out . The strike that targeted him was not , it must be said , an `` assassination , '' as many on the Left are framing it :\nIt 's very important that Suleimani was killed in Iraq . Why ?
