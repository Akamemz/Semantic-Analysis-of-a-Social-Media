To avoid a government shutdown , lawmakers must pass something by Sept. 30 .\nProblem is the two parties ca n't agree on a level of spending going forward , and there is disagreement even among Republicans as well . Plus , there 's no consensus over whether to preserve or replace the automatic spending cuts that went into effect this year and will deepen next year .\nExperts still expect that deals can be struck by key deadlines , but that 's hardly guaranteed as no one can confidently predict the end games -- particularly on the debt ceiling .\nWhat 's the first thing lawmakers must do ? Fund the government past Sept. 30 , which marks the last day of fiscal year 2013 .\nGiven the serious differences between the House and Senate on spending , there 's no chance they will pass a real budget for fiscal year 2014 .\nSo lawmakers will at least have to pass a temporary funding bill known as a `` continuing resolution , '' or CR , before Oct. 1 .\nAnd if it 's very short term , Congress will have to pass another one -- or several -- before Dec. 31 .\nAre they likely to pass a funding bill ? Probably , but a lot could complicate the effort .\nNormally when Congress passes a CR , it does so at current spending levels . Think of it like this : We ca n't agree on what to do , so let 's keep on keepin ' on until we can agree .\nBut that would be risky this time around because the law calls for lower spending caps to take effect in fiscal year 2014 .\nSo approving temporary funding at this year 's higher level means federal agencies would need to make abrupt cuts later to stay under the caps . By law , those cuts would need to occur 15 days after Congress adjourns for 2013 in a process known as sequestration .\nRight now , Democrats and Republicans ca n't even agree on whether to keep those spending caps in place . And some conservative Republicans have threatened to vote against any funding bill that includes money for Obamacare .\nWhat happens if Congress does n't pass funding by Oct. 1 ? Much of the federal government will shut down .\nWhat does a government shutdown mean ? Hundreds of thousands of federal workers would be furloughed without pay . And most federal government offices , programs , museums and parks would be shuttered .\nEssential services that protect human life and property would continue to operate . That includes air traffic control , national security , the handling of hazardous waste , food inspections and disaster assistance .\nFederal employees needed to preserve `` essential '' elements of the money and banking systems would not be furloughed . Mail would still be delivered .\nAnd President Obama and Congress would keep coming to work .\nWhat 's more , an analysis by the Congressional Research Service concludes that the implementation of Obamacare is also likely to continue in the event of a shutdown .\nHow long would a shutdown last ? As long as it takes Congress to agree on spending levels and pass bills that fund agencies at those levels . The longest shutdown lasted 21 days starting at the end of 1995 .\nIs a shutdown the worst that can happen ? Sadly , no . The ramifications of not raising the country 's debt ceiling in time would be much worse .\nThe country 's legal borrowing limit is currently set at $ 16.699 trillion .\nThat level was reached in mid-May . And the Treasury Department began its official juggling act , employing `` extraordinary measures '' to keep the country from breaching the ceiling . But Treasury does n't expect those measures to last beyond the middle of October .\nWhy does it need to be raised at all ? Both parties in Congress have approved permanent tax cuts and spending increases over the years .\nBy doing so , they add to future deficits and increase the country 's borrowing needs . Raising the ceiling simply lets Treasury continue to pay all the country 's obligations that Congress has already approved -- whether it 's a payment to a federal contractor , a Social Security check to a senior , or interest on the debt to a bond investor .\nWhat 's more , the aging population means there will be more spending on Medicare and Social Security with each passing year .\nThat 's why raising the debt ceiling is not a `` license to spend more , '' as some Republicans assert .
