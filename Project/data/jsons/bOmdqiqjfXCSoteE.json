Bush \u2019 s video message calling for national unity during the COVID-19 crisis struck all the right notes we have learned not to expect from Donald Trump . True to his vindictive form , Trump lost no time mocking Bush , whose message quickly went viral after it was released on May 2 .\nThe exchange put the contrast between the two men \u2019 s characters in stark relief . On the one side , an unstable and irresponsible Trump , presiding over an administration that has more to do with Barnum & Bailey than Franklin D. Roosevelt or Harry S. Truman . On the other , Bush\u2014not a poseur but a wartime president who staffed his administration with deeply experienced officials who took \u2588\u2588\u2588 seriously in a way that seems alien to the grifter commune that has coalesced around Trump .\nIndeed , Bush was guided by a concept of national interest that wasn \u2019 t solely defined as his own personal political interest , even if the two are necessarily linked . Bush was capable of ethical thinking , most notably in the case of AIDS in Africa , which he directed his administration to help address . Nor was he a bigot or an open supporter of white supremacists in the way that Trump surely is . And even as he was waging war against countries whose populations were largely or almost exclusively Muslim , he urged Americans not to demonize Islam , and unhesitatingly shared the stage with Muslim clerics .\nAs president , Bush was considered stubborn , incurious , and inarticulate\u2014but capable of learning from his mistakes , especially during his second term , when he worked to repair the damage he had done to the trans-Atlantic alliance during the first . He was rigid but not always .

Richard Clarke , the White House counterterrorism advisor who had warned Bush about al Qaeda , was quietly demoted and ultimately left the administration .\nIn a pattern that would be repeated almost to the letter by Trump , the Bush administration removed its own government experts on Iraq , cast aside a detailed planning process led by deeply informed career officials , and substituted political hacks with no relevant experience , whose only qualification was loyalty to Bush . Just as Trump declared the virus beaten before it truly began to spread , Bush announced \u201c mission accomplished \u201d as soon as Saddam fell .
