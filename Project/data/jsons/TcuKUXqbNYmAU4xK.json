The full requirement will go into effect in 2015 , rather than 2014 . The change means some employers -- namely , those with more than one benefit provider -- could use plans with higher limits or no limit at all on out-of-pocket costs during that period .\nThe grace period apparently was granted earlier this year , though was buried in reams of regulatory material and was not publicly reported until now . Department of Labor guidelines published in February had addressed the delay .\nThe confirmation comes weeks after the administration announced it was delaying a key insurance mandate -- the requirement on mid-sized and large businesses to provide coverage to full-time workers . The mandate , and the cap on costs , were both delayed for one year , in a move officials claimed was meant to give businesses more time to prepare .\nAccording to the Times , the decision to delay the cap on costs was made because many employers said they needed to upgrade their computer systems . The issue was they used different systems to administer both medical coverage and drug coverage , and they were not set up to `` aggregate '' all the money an individual spends out of pocket .\nAs a consequence of the delay , some health plans in 2014 will be able to keep separate caps for both medical care and drug plans , or have no cap at all on drug costs .\nIn response to the report , an Obama administration official stressed that the cap on individual spending for `` major medical coverage '' will still be in place in 2014 , `` on time . '' It will then be expanded to cover other benefits the following year .\n`` For the first time , new historic consumer protections under the Affordable Care Act will protect consumers from the worst insurance company abuses , by banning discrimination based on a pre-existing health conditions , ending lifetime and annual limits on what an insurance company will cover , and capping out-of pocket spending to protect Americans and their families , '' the official said .\nThe decision raises concerns that , at least for next year , the health care law will not save people as much money as President Obama claimed .
