Additionally , she said \u201c I have never been inside the PAC firewall and have done no work for this PAC . \u201d\nShe did , however , serve as president of the PAC under its previous incarnation as a pro-Cruz vehicle called Keep the Promise I during the Texas senator \u2019 s bitter primary battle against Trump , but she said she `` resigned in writing from KTPI [ the pro-Cruz super PAC ] in June , having previously expressed my intention to not manage the newly forming PAC . ''\nWhile Conway , 49 , has been a well-regarded player in GOP politics since the late 1980s , her work for Trump over the last few months has catapulted her into the national spotlight in a way experienced by only a tiny fraction of career political consultants .\nHer journey to Trump \u2019 s inner circle was circuitous , but profitable .\nIt traced to some extent the path taken by the family of hedge fund tycoon Bob Mercer , a longtime Conway ally who has emerged as among the leading financiers of the anti-establishment right .\nThe Polling Company in early 2015 was paid $ 65,000 by a super PAC that laid the groundwork for Ben Carson \u2019 s bid for the GOP presidential nomination , and the retired neurosurgeon 's campaign would go on to pay $ 438,000 to a data firm owned by the Mercers .\nAfter Conway \u2019 s firm stopped working for the Carson super PAC , The Polling Company began working for a trio of PACs supporting Cruz , one of which was funded by $ 13.5 million donated by Bob Mercer , according to FEC records .\nLess than two months after Cruz dropped out of the race , essentially ceding the nomination to Trump , the Mercers and Conway switched their allegiances to the presumptive nominee .\nIn late June , the super PAC changed its name to Make America Number 1 and converted itself into a pro-Trump vehicle , installing veteran GOP operative David Bossie to run it . A few days later , on July 1 , Conway joined Trump \u2019 s campaign as an adviser .\n`` There was no overlap for me , even though that would have been legally permitted , '' Conway said of her work for the PAC and the campaign .\nBut the PAC kept paying The Polling Company , listing payments of $ 81,000 on June 24 for political strategy consulting and $ 247,000 on August 23 for survey research , according to FEC filings . The filings do not make clear when the work was performed or for which iteration of the PAC .\nConway explained that it was Bossie 's decision to hire the firm . `` I do not know the details \u2014 states , methodology , survey instruments , results \u2014 because I can not know them . '' On Friday , she said the firm \u201c performed survey research and messaging work for this PAC in late June and early July. \u201d But late Sunday night , she indicated that the work was restricted to `` surveys in late June . '' Whatever the past work , she said \u201c no further work is planned . \u201d\nIn all , the PAC , during its pro-Cruz and pro-Trump incarnations , paid $ 952,000 to Conway \u2019 s firm . The firm also reaped another $ 198,000 from the two other pro-Cruz PACs , as well as $ 41,000 from a PAC affiliated with Citizens United , a group run by Bossie with financial support from the Mercers .\nWhile Conway has known Trump for about a decade \u2014 they met when she lived in one of his buildings in Manhattan \u2014 multiple sources said she was elevated to become campaign manager in August at the encouragement of Bob Mercer \u2019 s daughter Bekah Mercer .\nA GOP strategist who is familiar with Conway \u2019 s relationship with the Mercers said that Bekah Mercer , who runs the family \u2019 s political operation and has become an influential figure in Trump \u2019 s orbit , \u201c leans heavily on Kellyanne Conway .
