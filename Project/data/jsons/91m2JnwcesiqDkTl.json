Both spent the past decade largely crippled by congressional obstruction , first from Democratic majorities and then from Republican ones . Now freed from those obstacles \u2014 at least for the moment \u2014 and operating under Democratic leadership impatient to make up for lost time , these agencies are promoting workers \u2019 and unions \u2019 rights more aggressively than Washington has witnessed in a generation .
