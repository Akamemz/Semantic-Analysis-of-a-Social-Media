Several courts have been looking into cases demanding the dissolution of the panel .\nThe Egyptian leader also decreed that all decisions he has made since taking office in June and until a new constitution is adopted and a new parliament is elected -- which is not expected before next spring -- are not subject to appeal in court or by any other authority . He also barred any court from dissolving the Islamist-led upper house of parliament , a largely toothless body that has also faced court cases .\nThe moves effectively remove any oversight on Morsi , the longtime Muslim Brotherhood figure who became Egypt 's first freely elected president last summer after the Feb. 11 , 2011 fall of autocrat Hosni Mubarak .
