That 's quite a haul for a guy about whom an Inspector General 's report ( PDF ) fretted , `` we were concerned about text messages exchanged by FBI Deputy Assistant Director Peter Strzok and Lisa Page , Special Counsel to the Deputy Director , that potentially indicated or created the appearance that investigative decisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations .
