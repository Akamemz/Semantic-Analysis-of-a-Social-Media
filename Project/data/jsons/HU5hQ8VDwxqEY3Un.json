    "content": "Not long ago , former Indiana Gov . Mitch Daniels was a sleeper pick to win the Republican presidential nomination . He was courted to run in 2012 and , as recently as this summer , was being prodded by conservative luminaries like George Will , who declared in a June column that Daniels is \u201c the president America needs . \u201d\nThere were good reasons for this . As governor of Indiana , Daniels developed a reputation as a practical and competent leader . Several prominent conservative governors have foundered in recent years ( e.g. , Bobby Jindal in Louisiana and Sam Brownback in Kansas ) , but Daniels thrived .\nAgainst the backdrop of a recession , he balanced the budget without raising taxes , left the state with a $ 500 million surplus , and created a massive school-choice program for low-income students .\nFor liberals , Daniels \u2019 s tenure was less than thrilling , but by conservative standards he was undeniably a success .\nIn the end , though , he decided against running . A big reason , according to a 2011 Politico report , was resistance from his family , his wife in particular , who did not want to deal with the media scrutiny a presidential campaign involves .\nToday , he serves as president of Purdue University , a position he has held since 2012 .\nI spoke with Daniels yesterday morning . It was a sprawling conversation about Donald Trump , the future of the Republican Party , the perils of one-party rule in Washington , the student debt crisis , and why he didn \u2019 t run for president .\nOne of the more consequential results of this election is that Republicans now have near-total control over the government , with the presidency and both chambers of Congress .\nIf you were Paul Ryan , what are two or three things you \u2019 d go all in on legislatively ?\nI do n't think I should start handing out advice to anyone , but I 'll say a couple things . At some point in these four years , I earnestly hope that people in both parties will get serious about the debt problems that we 're about to dump on future generations . There 's no argument about this \u2014 it 's basic arithmetic . These are n't matters of opinion , and the problem has grown and grown .\nThe health care bill that we have is clearly collapsing on itself , and people in both parties have acknowledged that , so a reset there is probably an early focus .\nI suppose the main thing is , and it wo n't be entirely for the legislature for the address , but this country desperately needs an economy that grows faster than 1 or 2 percent . This is one reason , I think , certainly not the only reason , for the Trump surprise .\nThis wo n't be easy , but it 's something the country badly needs .\nSpeaking of the economy , how disorienting is it to see an anti-trade protectionist become the next Republican president ?\nApparently , we were going to get one regardless of who won . This was such a strong theme in the Democratic primaries , after all . Let 's wait and see what really happens here . The issues I mentioned previously are more important to trying to get on a better growth track than which trade agreements are or are n't initial to the next couple years .\nTrump seems to have drawn a lot of white working-class voters to his side by opposing unpopular trade deals like NAFTA or the Trans-Pacific Partnership . Assuming you support those deals , how would you pitch them to rural voters in Pennsylvania or Michigan or Wisconsin ?\nI \u2019 d say there are alternative explanations . The economic concern is very real : Eight years of a lousy economy and a comparatively weak recovery from a recession will do that . People are looking for explanations , and you have to articulate a vision of change that appears promising to people .\nThe other thing I \u2019 d say that 's missing is this : Economic pessimism was clearly a driver of this , but another one is the strong sense among a lot of people that they were tired of being treated with contempt and looked down upon , and I 'm not talking about the Clinton campaign in particular , but the broader political establishment .\nPeople feel that their values and life choices are suddenly considered backward and uneducated , and there was a recoil to that . A starting point for people who were n't successful in this election is to at least consider this .\nI \u2019 ve heard this point of view , it \u2019 s the J.D . Vance position , and I understand . But here \u2019 s the thing : There \u2019 s an element of the Republican base that , while I wouldn \u2019 t use the words \u201c backward \u201d or \u201c stupid , \u201d I would say they are racist and nativist and reactionary .\nTrump empowered this element of the base , he normalized it , and I think we absolutely have to reckon with that . And I think we can do that without painting all Trump voters or Republicans as uneducated bigots .\nSure , and I think every time a party gets thumped badly , how they react is important . We ultimately need two competitive parties that can compete for the center as they once did . And if you step back from this moment , it 's clear the Democratic Party is down , and I hope that they 'll reflect a bit about that and perhaps try to empathize with some of the voters they lost .\nAs a current university president , I have to ask you about the student debt problem , and college affordability more generally . As it stands , middle-class Americans are being priced out of college , or are forced to take on mountains of debt in order to attend .\nI think it 's an urgent problem . At Purdue , we 've tried to deal with it directly . We 're in the fourth year of a five-year tuition freeze . We also cut the costs of room and board and books . It 's less expensive to go to our school than it was four years ago , and it 'll be less expensive next year .\nNo , and I 'm surprised by that . I really thought , incorrectly , that the market was about to demand more restraint on the part of universities in terms of cost increases , but it was much less than I expected .\nStudents who graduate with large amounts of debt struggle mightily . They 're less likely to start a family , they 're less likely to own a home , they 're less likely to start a business . So there are serious consequences to forcing students to go into debt .\nDo you think we have too many people in college ? By that I mean there are a lot of people who are going into debt to earn useless degrees with no applicability in the labor market . Would they be better served with job training or vocational programs ?\nSome certainly would . We do n't necessarily have too many people in college , but we do have too many people in college in exactly the setting you just described : studying things with little or no rigor , things with little or no applicability in the world of work that has evolved , and being charged too much for it .\nMany of these people could have found a better option that would better serve them after school . And there are careers emerging all the times , fulfilling and well-paying careers , that do n't require the traditional college diploma .\nThere are many technological fields like IT , for example , in which a diploma is far less important than what you know , what you can actually do , and it does n't matter where or how you learned the skills .\nLet \u2019 s circle back to politics . How surprised were you by Trump \u2019 s victory ?\nVery much so . It completed my perfect season of being wrong about almost everything all year long . I do n't think I 'm alone in that . Look , I was surprised just because while we 've all learned to be skeptical about public opinion survey methodologies , toward the end data seemed so consistent and so clear that one had to believe it .\nWhat we saw is that there 's a big swath of America that , in various ways , the elites or the political class in this country did n't know existed , and now they do .\nWhat do you make of this bipartisan revolt against the establishment ? Did you see it coming ?\nI think we all saw elements of it in the extremity of the primary seasons on both sides . In addition to Trump , a serious contender on the Democratic side who had never really been a Democrat and was always on the fringe of the party made a serious run .\nSo it was clear that there was enormous dissatisfaction , but that it would ultimately be manifested this way was very much a surprise to me .\nGive the populist mood of the country , do you think Bernie Sanders would \u2019 ve defeated Trump in a general election ?\nIt 's very hard to tell . Mr. Trump told us very little about what he thinks or what he would do . Sanders , on the other hand , told us in detail , and , honestly , it was enormously impractical and might have scared the pants off a lot of America . But I ca n't tell you how that might have turned out .\nWe certainly could not have had an outcome more surprising than this , though .\nDoes Trump \u2019 s nomination and election fundamentally change the GOP , both philosophically and politically ?\nI do n't know . It was a very successful night for the party nationally , and the vast majority of those people still believe in a set of center-right principles that we 're all familiar with . So it remains to be seen whether the obviously very different set of ideas , if you can call them that , that Mr. Trump ran on will change anyone 's mind or whether they 'll have to be assimilated .\nPresumably , he 's going to want to be a successful president , and to do that he 's going to have to work with people . And many of the people with whom he 'll have to work are not going to see things the way he does .\nEvan McMullin , the conservative candidate who challenged Trump in Utah , said after Trump \u2019 s victory that \u201c the Republican Party can no longer be considered the home for conservatives . \u201d\nI do n't think we can say that yet . Again , you have 52 senators , well over 200 congresspeople , and lots of governors who , as far as I can tell , ran on the sort of platform , such as it was , that Mr. Trump campaigned on .\nMost folks would agree that he campaigned mainly as a matter of personality and vague thematics , and so it 's not at all clear to me that those millions who came out to vote for him were voting for any specific policy .\nWell , whatever the reason , they have a considerable amount of power now . What do you think they \u2019 ll do with it ?\nI 'm not sure , but it 's certainly one of the moments that is equal parts opportunity and danger . The dangers are obvious . If they produce poor results , they 'll pay a price . They 're in a similar position to what Obama and his majorities were in years ago .\nThey 'll have to do better than that , and it depends on how Trump decides to work with these allies . Again , there are few people in Congress who stood for exactly the same things he did , but there 's every reason to work with them if he wants to accomplish anything .\nYour name was floated around as a possible candidate for president this year , especially among the Republican intelligentsia . I imagine you would have had a lot of support .\nI seriously looked at it when many people I respected urged me to do it in 2012 . Having decided not to do it , and having accepted the opportunity to work here at Purdue , it just did n't enter my mine this time .\nI will say , though , that I do n't think I would 've been a particularly effective candidate in the environment that evolved in 2016 . Maybe in 2012 I would 've been stronger , but things were much different then . But not this year , not in this atmosphere .\nI believe , and a lot of people do as well , that our process is broken . Campaigns are too long , the process is too invasive , the discourse is too frivolous . I have no idea why decent people would subject themselves to it , frankly .\nThat 's exactly right . It 's really a savage process , and most people have to think twice about subjecting themselves and their family to it .\nI remember in 2012 a friend of mine said I had a fatal flaw as a presidential candidate , and that was that I could live without it . To do it these days , you almost have to be obsessive about it in order to go through the process and endure what candidates have to endure .\nWhat would make it better ? I think what we 've seen recently has caused a lot of thoughtful people to have a whole new appreciation for the system that we tore up and left behind a few decades ago , namely a more deliberative system in which the parties had more to say about the process . I applaud the Democrats \u2019 use of superdelegates , which preserves a modicum of this .\nThe idea being that doing so would produce less polarizing candidates ?\nExactly . As we 've become more polarized , this becomes more important , because when you let primaries decide the outcome , as they now do , you empower the extremists on both sides , as these are the people who vote disproportionately in the primaries .\nTrump , for example , was nominated by a series of minorities that were n't necessarily representative of the broader Republican Party . So I think a system that restores some authority to the actual parties and conventions would be preferable .\nNo , I 've got no plans . I 've always believed in the citizen-service idea . I never expected to run for public office myself . When I did , it was a marvelous opportunity . I 'd like to think we left a much better state behind .\nBut there 's more to life than politics , and what I 'm doing now is just as rewarding as public service .",
