He signaled pretty clearly in our interview that he was done trashing his rivals , at least for now . Trump , in the hallowed tradition of front-runners , is trying to pivot toward party unity .\nIt wasn \u2019 t for lack of trying .

And he told me he expected a milder atmosphere on the debate stage .\nOf course , Trump lost control of this coming-together narrative when protestors shut down his Chicago rally the next night .
