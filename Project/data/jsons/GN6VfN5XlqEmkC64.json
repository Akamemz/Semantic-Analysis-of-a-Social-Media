    "content": "President Donald Trump \u2019 s first year in office was mired in political scandal and Republican Party infighting . But on Tuesday night , in his first State of the Union , Trump described a prosperous and harmonious nation .\nWhile it \u2019 s true his administration has had serious influence on the nation \u2019 s culture , regulatory policy , and legislative priorities , Trump took sweeping credit for massive improvements in the nation \u2019 s health care system , economy , and foreign affairs . Many of these claims were misleading , involved serious omissions , or were downright false .\n1 ) Trump tried to take credit for the black unemployment rate \u2019 s decline\nTrump cited a statistic he was \u201c very proud of \u201d in his State of the Union speech Tuesday : \u201c African-American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded . \u201d\nBut as \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2019 s Matthew Yglesias points out , \u201c a simple eyeball of the African-American unemployment rate ... makes it clear that Trump has nothing to do with this trend . \u201d\nThe African-American unemployment rate has been on the decline since 2011 , long before Trump was in the White House .\nTrump may be \u201c proud \u201d of the statistic , but African-American lawmakers in the House chamber Tuesday were less enthusiastic about Trump claiming credit . Many in the Congressional Black Caucus , group of roughly 49 African-American representatives and senators , boycotted the State of the Union .\nAfter a year in which Trump failed to immediately denounce white supremacists and started a national campaign against black NFL players protesting racial injustice , among many other instances of racism , those who did attend said they were doing so to \u201c stare racism in the face , \u201d CBC Chair Rep. Cedric Richmond ( D-LA ) said in a news conference Tuesday , adding that Trump has made the country \u201c less safe for people of color . \u201d\n2 ) Trump \u2019 s claims about repealing Obamacare \u2019 s individual mandate had a major omission\n\u201c We eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making less than $ 50,000 a year , forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they could not afford government-ordered health plans , \u201d Trump said in the House chamber during his speech . \u201c We repealed the core of disastrous Obamacare . The individual mandate is now gone . \u201d\nTrump is right on the surface , of course : The mandate is gone , and it was originally considered core to the Affordable Care Act . But these days , most experts largely believe that the tax penalty for not having insurance was actually too low to have the desired effect , even as Trump cites its \u201c tremendous \u201d nature and that the law \u2019 s markets will survive \u2014 if imperfectly \u2014 without it .\nBut on the margins , the mandate \u2019 s elimination will likely lead to some bump in premiums and fewer Americans having health coverage over the long term . The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 13 million people would lose coverage if the individual mandate were repealed , and that premiums in the individual market would rise by an additional 10 percent . The mandate \u2019 s repeal could also drive some insurers out of the market , at a time when some parts of the country have already been at risk of having no insurers to sell plans through the ACA marketplaces .\n3 ) Trump said his administration is committed to fighting the opioid crisis . They haven \u2019 t done much .\n\u201c My administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need , \u201d Trump said Tuesday . \u201c For those who have been so terribly hurt , the struggle will be long and it will be difficult . As Americans always do , in the end , we will succeed . We will prevail . \u201d\nIf you listen to his words about the opioid epidemic , he seems to understand it \u2019 s an emergency . Yet in the past year , there has been no move by Trump \u2019 s administration to actually spend more money on the opioid crisis . Key positions in the administration remain unfilled , even without nominees in the case of the White House \u2019 s drug czar office and the Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) . And although Trump \u2019 s emergency declaration was renewed this month , it has led to essentially no action since it was first signed \u2014 no significant new resources , no major new initiatives .\nTaking action on the opioid epidemic could have been an easy win . It \u2019 s an issue that crosses partisan lines , with both Democrats and Republicans angling to do something about it . There \u2019 s evidence that it \u2019 s very relevant to Trump \u2019 s own base . While experts talk about needing as much as tens of billions of dollars for the crisis over the next few years , that \u2019 s actually not much in federal budget terms \u2014 a fraction of a percent for a government that spends trillions a year .\nAnd yet the Trump administration has barely budged . Beyond declaring a public health emergency , the administration has done little to nothing to combat the crisis .\n\u201c One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs . In many other countries , these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States , \u201d Trump said . \u201c That is why I have directed my administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of our top priorities . Prices will come down . \u201d\nBut one year into Trump \u2019 s presidency , he has more or less abandoned his outspoken pledges to bring down the cost of America \u2019 s medicines , the highest in the world .\nExperts say that in the first year of Trump \u2019 s presidency , the drug industry has gained the upper hand in the lobbying campaign against its foes in the health care industry .\nUnder Trump , drug companies have undertaken a concerted campaign to shift the discussion about drug prices to a conversation about out-of-pocket costs , in which health insurers and pharmacy benefits managers are under the microscope .\nThe companies \u2019 campaign appears to have borne fruit , judging by regulatory changes being pursued by the Trump administration on Medicare . Trump has also filled the executive branch with officials closely tied to the drug industry ; his new pick to lead Health and Human Services , Alex Azar , was most recently a top executive at Eli Lilly .\n5 ) Trump took credit for defeating ISIS that he doesn \u2019 t deserve\nIn his State of the Union address , President Trump claimed a very clear policy accomplishment : the military defeat of ISIS .\n\u201c Last year , I pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish ISIS from the face of the earth , \u201d he said . \u201c One year later , I \u2019 m proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated very close to 100 percent of the territory just recently held by these killers in Iraq and in Syria . \u201d\nThere \u2019 s real truth here . The amount of territory controlled by ISIS declined by 60 percent between January and October 2017 , according to a count by IHS Markit , a strategic intelligence firm . The group lost control over both Mosul , Iraq \u2019 s second-largest city , and Raqqa , which served as the de facto capital of ISIS \u2019 s so-called caliphate ; it now no longer controls a major populated city in either country .\nYet Trump \u2019 s comment implies that nearly all of ISIS-held territory was liberated in the past year . This isn \u2019 t true . In fact , it \u2019 s not clear that Trump deserves much credit for these developments \u2014 if any . His counter-ISIS strategy has , for the most part , been a continuation of the one the Obama administration began back in 2014 , which had already been steadily chipping away at the group \u2019 s territory .\nSo while it \u2019 s true that ISIS lost a lot of territory under Trump \u2019 s watch , there \u2019 s little evidence to suggest that he can count it as his accomplishment .\nTrump has been making speeches about the need to protect America from nefarious immigrants for his entire ( extremely brief ) political career . He has never been terribly closely fettered to facts on the issue . His first State of the Union was no exception .\nTrump spent most of the immigration section of his speech attacking the Salvadoran-American street gang MS-13 \u2014 and claiming , bizarrely and with absolutely no substantiation , that his administration has put \u201c thousands and thousands and thousands \u201d of MS-13 members in prison or on deportation flights . ( There \u2019 s no data to support this claim ; in general , numbers of Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests of convicted criminals in the interior of the US are comparable to past years , though arrests of noncriminals rose sharply from the final years of the Obama administration . )\nHis attempts to show compassion were equally innumerate . Trump bragged that his White House asks Congress to create a path to citizenship for three times as many immigrants ( 1.8 million ) as President Obama did ; Obama , of course , supported a plan to legalize most of the 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the US , and the DACA program to which Trump appears to be referring ( which protected 690,000 immigrants ) had no path to citizenship .\nWhen it came to legal immigration , Trump \u2019 s failings were qualitative . He claimed falsely , again , that immigrants selected in the \u201c visa lottery \u201d are randomly given green cards with no thought to security \u2014 when in fact , after being selected in the lottery , immigrants are vetted just as much as any other immigrant to the US . And he repeated a fantasy about immigrants bringing \u201c nearly unlimited numbers of distant relatives \u201d to the US via \u201c chain migration \u201d \u2014 a fantasy that \u2019 s led many Republicans to call for a ban on sponsoring grandparents , uncles , aunts , or cousins , none of whom can be sponsored under existing law either .\n7 ) Trump claims to have ended the \u201c war on coal. \u201d There was no war to begin with .\nIn his State of the Union address on Tuesday , President Trump squeezed in a brief boast about his administration \u2019 s energy policy .\n\u201c We have ended the war on American energy \u2014 and we have ended the war on beautiful , clean coal , \u201d he said . \u201c We are now very proudly an exporter of energy to the world . \u201d\nThese statements are misleading on several counts . President Obama didn \u2019 t wage a \u201c war on coal , \u201d as Trump has often claimed . ( Read David Roberts \u2019 s in-depth explainer on this . ) Trump hasn \u2019 t made the US an energy exporter . He also doesn \u2019 t seem to have a good grasp of what \u201c clean coal \u201d is .\nThe United States has exported coal , oil , natural gas , and energy technology for decades , and in recent years , the amount of energy the country is exporting has started to catch up to the amount of energy the United States brings in .\nAs for coal , mining jobs have crashed from a high of 800,000 workers in the 1920s to about 76,000 today . Meanwhile , coal consumption is falling too .\nAutomation in coal mining and competition from other energy sources like natural gas and renewables have caused the sector \u2019 s decline ; regulations have played only a small role . Coal production and its share of the electricity mix is falling too , largely coinciding with the shale gas boom . Trump \u2019 s administration has done little to stop that decline .",
