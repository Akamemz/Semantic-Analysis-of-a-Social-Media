The survey \u2013 which was conducted after the two party conventions and the political firestorm over last week \u2019 s U.S. embassy attacks , but before Romney \u2019 s controversial comments about the 47 percent of the country \u201c who are dependent on government \u201d \u2013 shows the percentages believing that the country is headed in the right direction and thinking that the economy will improve at their highest levels since 2009 . In the presidential horse race , Obama and Vice President Joe Biden get the support of 50 percent of likely voters , while Romney and running mate Paul Ryan get 45 percent . Among a wider sample of registered voters , the president \u2019 s lead is 6 points , 50 percent to 44 percent \u2013 up from Obama \u2019 s 4-point edge last month , 48 percent to 44 percent .\n( 1 ) : The poll finds that the president \u2019 s approval rating on foreign policy ( now 49 percent ) dipped five percentage points since last August . Why ? I suspect it \u2019 s because of this , this , and this .\n( 2 ) A majority of registered voters -- 55 percent -- say the country is on the wrong track , whereas just 39 percent say it \u2019 s on the right track . This bodes well for Mitt Romney .\n( 3 ) Since The One took office , more voters today believe the country is worse off ( 41 percent ) than better off ( 38 percent ) . ( Caveat : only 36 percent believe Mitt Romney is \u201c better prepared \u201d to lead the nation over the next four years . On the other hand , a solid majority say the same thing about President Obama ) .\n( 4 ) President Obama maintains a double digit lead among women , college graduates , and especially African-Americans . However , Governor Romney leads by eight percentage points among white voters , although ( according to the pollsters ) that margin has narrowed considerably in recent months .\nIn short , I think Democratic pollster Peter Hart summed up the NBC/WSJ findings best : \u201c After a year that has looked like a two-step back-and-forth , it is clear that Barack Obama has moved a step ahead .
