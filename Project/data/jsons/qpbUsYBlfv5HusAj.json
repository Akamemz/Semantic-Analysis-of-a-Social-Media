Why would it , since in his native Jordan , the family ( of which he happens to be a member ) that controls almost all media also runs the country ?\nSo perhaps it \u2019 s understandable that the prince doesn \u2019 t understand what happens in a real democracy , where the press can attack the government all it likes and those in power and their supporters also have the right to push back against their media critics . But it is still pretty outrageous for the man tasked with speaking on behalf of human rights around the world to denounce President Trump for his non-stop attacks on any media outlet or journalist who has the temerity to criticize him . Yet as crazy as it is to hear this sort of thing from the U.N. , the problem is that it reflects the view of many of the journalists he is supporting .\nSpeaking in his official capacity as a U.N. high commissioner this week , Zeid slammed Trump for his attacks on the press . He said they were \u201c poisonous because it has consequences elsewhere. \u201d If journalists were harmed , he asked , \u201c does the president not bear responsibility for this , for having fanned this ? \u201d Other nations would be inspired to crack down on freedom of the press , he said , adding the claim that recent actions in Cambodia were inspired by Trump . The prince also accused Trump of encouraging anti-Semitism and denounced his statements about Muslims , Hispanics , and transgendered people as \u201c grossly irresponsible . \u201d\nThat a Jordanian prince ( albeit one who would be in line to inherit the throne of Iraq if the Hashemite monarchy deposed in 1958 were ever to be revived there ) \u2014 even one who works for the U.N. \u2014 has something to say about these subjects is , well , gross . Jordan is a relatively liberal Arab state compared with its neighbors , but no one in its media would dare criticize King Abdullah and hope to stay employed . Moreover , an official who represents a country that does not have any Jews is in no position to discuss anti-Semitism except to confess that it is a dominant factor in its society and media . The tiny Christian minority also faces discrimination , and transgendered people can not be said to have any rights .\nTo note this doesn \u2019 t excuse Trump . Though he is no anti-Semite or racist , the president has failed to consistently condemn right-wing hate groups , especially after Charlottesville .
