Vote Now in Urgent Poll\nTwo years ago , when the Supreme Court declared Obamacare 's penalty to be a tax , it `` doomed '' the healthcare reform act as an `` unconstitutional violation of the origination clause , '' columnist George Will says.This Thursday , the Washington , D.C. , Court of Appeals , the nation 's second-most important court , will hear arguments on whether the Affordable Care Act adheres to the Constitution 's `` origination clause , '' which declares that `` all bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives ; but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on other bills , '' Will writes in his column in The Washington Post Saturday.Will points out that the Democrat-controlled Senate passed Obamacare on a party-line vote `` without a Democratic vote to spare , after a series of unsavory transactions that purchased the assent of several shrewdly extortionate Democrats.Thursday 's arguments , said Will , will show that the act was `` indisputably a revenue measure '' that did not originate in the House , which later passed the House on yet another party-line vote.The appeals case was filed by Iowa artist and small-business owner Matt Sissell , who is being represented by the Pacific Legal Foundation , a group that litigates for limited government.Sissell does not have and does not want health insurance , saying he 'd rather invest in his business , and object to paying a penalty for rejecting service under the Obamacare `` shared responsibility payment '' mandate.But in June 2012 , Will writes , the Supreme Court said the penalty is actually a tax , and mild enough that people can choose to pay it rather than buy insurance . `` It is collected by the IRS , and the proceeds go to the Treasury for the general operations of the federal government , not to fund a particular program , '' said Will . `` This surely makes the ACA a revenue measure . `` The Senate was able to pass the bill , said Will , by calling it an amendment to a tax credit bill passed in 2009 for members of the armed forces and federal employees who were first-time home buyers , but had nothing to do with health care . `` Two months later the Senate 'amended ' this bill by obliterating it , '' said Will.It then `` renamed it and completely erased its contents , replacing them with the ACA \u2019 s contents . `` But case law says that for the Senate to amend a House-passed revenue bill , the amendment must be `` germane to the subject matter '' of that bill . `` The Senate \u2019 s shell game \u2014 gutting and replacing the House bill \u2014 created the ACA from scratch , '' said Will . `` The ACA obviously flunks the germaneness test , without which the House \u2019 s constitutional power of originating revenue bills would be nullified . `` And while there are two kinds of bills that do now fit under the origination clause , Will said , the Obamacare tax is not enforcement penalty and does not raise revenue to support only one government program , both requirements under the clause , and do not fit the criteria.Obamacare defenders say its tax is `` not quite a tax '' because it is not for raising revenue , but `` the origination clause , a judicially enforceable limit on the taxing power , would be effectively erased from the Constitution if any tax with any regulatory \u2014 behavior-changing \u2014 purpose or effect were exempt from the clause , '' insists Will .",
