That proved especially embarrassing since candidates who began the race with far lower national profiles , including businessman Andrew Yang , made it .\nOn the eve of Wednesday \u2019 s qualifying deadline , Gillibrand sat down with her family and decided that if a pair of polls set to be released the following morning didn \u2019 t help her meet the polling threshold , she \u2019 d drop out .\nTo get to the U.S. House , Gillibrand had topped an incumbent Republican in a conservative part of upstate New York in 2007 , and she was appointed to the Senate two years later , filling the seat vacated by Hillary Clinton . She later retained the seat during a 2010 special election , as well as in 2012 and 2018 .\nVocal in the Senate on curbing sexual harassment and military sexual assault , and promoting equal pay for women and family leave , Gillibrand made those and her staunch defense of abortion rights the core of her presidential bid . She stood out in the packed Democratic presidential field by becoming the first to declare she \u2019 d only appoint judges to the Supreme Court who consider the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide settled law , though most of her competitors quickly followed suit .\nGillibrand also used her run to highlight systemic racism and white privilege , speaking on the subject frequently on issues such as mass incarceration , urban gun violence and maternal mortality rates for black women .\nShe initially hoped to stay in the race in a bid to qualify for October \u2019 s debates , but her financial situation made that impossible . Gillibrand finishes with just $ 800,000 left in her campaign bank account . That means she spent well over $ 7 million , just since June 30 .\nA campaign aide said Wednesday that getting media coverage that could help boost Gillibrand \u2019 s polling and fundraising had become too difficult . Gillibrand met with staff at her campaign headquarters in Troy , New York , on Wednesday afternoon to tell them her race was over .\nAfter forming an exploratory committee in January and formally entering the race by calling President Donald Trump a \u201c coward \u201d in a March speech delivered near the New York City skyscraper bearing his name , Gillibrand began with $ 10.5-plus million left over from her landslide 2018 Senate victory in her presidential campaign coffers .\nThat seemed like more than enough for the long haul .
