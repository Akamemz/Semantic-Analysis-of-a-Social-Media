Elizabeth Warren 's announcement in the dying hours of 2018 that she is launching an exploratory committee -- the first step toward a campaign for the party 's nomination .\nThere was an ominous feel to the holidays given the dark cloud hanging over Trump because of special counsel Robert Mueller , whose findings could take the nation down the bitter road to impeachment in the year to come .\nBut the President does n't just have to worry about Mueller . Democrats are days away from taking control of the House of Representatives and inaugurating a novel challenge for Trump 's presidency -- congressional oversight .\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 265 points to close 2018 , in a sleepy session compared to the stomach-churning instability that produced the worst year for stocks in a decade and could fuel economic uncertainty that could play into the 2020 race .\nAnd as always , there are signs of instability and chaos in the White House , with confusion over Trump 's exact position on a border wall and his planned Syria troop withdrawal , while key staff vacancies were unfilled .\nTrump stayed at home , often largely alone in the White House over the Christmas and New Year 's break , tweeting at Democrats but with no real political movement evident over the shutdown . Often the aim seemed to be to talk solely to his political base -- a trend that is likely to go on all year .\n`` I 'm in the Oval Office . Democrats , come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for Border Security , including the wall . You voted yes in 2006 and 2013 . One more yes , but with me in office , I 'll get it built , and Fast ! '' Trump tweeted on Monday afternoon .\nIt 's unclear how Trump plans to get out of the partial shutdown that has hit hundreds of thousands of federal workers , since Democrats are disinclined to grant funding for his border wall .\nHe could have avoided the shutdown altogether had he agreed to sign on to a stopgap measure that passed the Senate last month and would have kept government open in the short term , but would not have funded the wall .\nBut the President backtracked under pressure from conservatives in the House and right-wing media commentators like Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh .\nSo to climb down now would risk similar condemnation and the possibility of a weakening of support among base voters on whom he depends for political viability , given his decision not to try to broaden his 2016 coalition .\nWith a weak but stable political standing -- between 40 % and 45 % approve of the job he 's doing in most polls -- the President clearly understands that he needs to engineer a series of base-pleasing fights this year to keep his political foundation intact .\nBut as Democrats take over the House , they have little incentive to bail the President out -- at least until there is evidence that his tactic of branding them weak on border security is causing them political damage .\nAfter all , Trump won election by saying Mexico , not US taxpayers , would pay for the wall . And he said he would be proud to shut down the government over the wall in a notorious Oval Office clash with Democratic leaders .\nThe next move in the saga will come later in the week , when Democrats put the ball back in the Republican court .\nThe soon-to-be Democrat-controlled House is expected to vote on six Senate spending bills and a stopgap measure to reopen the Homeland Security Department at its current funding levels until February 8 , a Democratic aide told CNN Monday .\nAlthough the temporary measure would maintain the current $ 1.3 billion in border security money , Senate GOP Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he wo n't move any legislation until Trump signs off .\nWarren took the first plunge of the front-running Democratic pack , giving her a head start on the first quarter fundraising race that will be used to assess the viability of the top contenders . She is likely to find the field crowded very soon .\nThe Massachusetts senator carved out populist economic ground with her opening message , stressing her humble roots and wholesome family background and accusing billionaires and corporations of attacking the middle class .\nWarren 's strengths include long crusades against big banks and Wall Street titans , as Democrats seek a candidate that can loosen Trump 's hold on working-class voters in the industrial Midwest in 2020 .\n`` Corruption is poisoning our democracy , '' Warren said in a web video filmed in her kitchen , and then hit out at `` bigotry and fear '' in a sidelong reference to Trump .\nPundits are already questioning , however , whether Warren has missed her moment , will be viewed as too old at 69 , or will be seen as too white at a time when a youthful and ethnic transformation is taking place in the Democratic Party .\nHer effort to defuse Trump 's attacks over her claims to Native American heritage last year with a DNA test was widely seen as botched and damaging to her candidacy by Beltway insiders .\nStill , Warren has a jump on other rivals , possibly including California Sen.
