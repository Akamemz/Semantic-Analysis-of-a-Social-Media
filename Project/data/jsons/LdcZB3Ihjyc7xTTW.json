He released the full report in April and delivered a statement on the report in May .\nWhile both hearings are expected to deliver some fireworks , it \u2019 s unclear any new information will come from them \u2014 though , of course , having Mueller read aloud a report most Americans haven \u2019 t sifted through is powerful . In his opening statement , Mueller tried to set the tone : He laid out concisely the findings of his report and indicated he doesn \u2019 t plan to stray from them in his testimony . He also emphasized the gravity of the broader matter \u2014 a foreign government interfering in US elections . \u201c I \u2019 ve seen a number of challenges to our democracy , \u201d he said . \u201c The Russian government \u2019 s effort to interfere in our election is among the most serious . \u201d\nGood morning Chairman Nadler , Ranking Member Collins , and members of the Committee .\nAs you know , in May 2017 , the Acting Attorney General asked me to serve as Special Counsel . I undertook that role because I believed that it was of paramount interest to the nation to determine whether a foreign adversary had interfered in the presidential election .\nAs the Acting Attorney General said at the time , the appointment was \u201c necessary in order for the American people to have full confidence in the outcome. \u201d My staff and I carried out this assignment with that critical objective in mind : to work quietly , thoroughly , and with integrity so that the public would have full confidence in the outcome . The order appointing me as Special Counsel directed our Office to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election . This included investigating any links or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign . It also included investigating efforts to interfere with , or obstruct , the investigation . Throughout the investigation , I continually stressed two things to the team that we had assembled .\nFirst , we needed to do our work as thoroughly as possible and as expeditiously as possible . It was in the public interest for our investigation to be complete , but not to last a day longer than necessary .\nSecond , the investigation needed to be conducted fairly and with absolute integrity . Our team would not leak or take other actions that could compromise the integrity of our work . All decisions were made based on the facts and the law . During the course of our investigation , we charged more than 30 defendants with committing federal crimes , including 12 officers of the Russian military . Seven defendants have been convicted or pled guilty . Certain of the charges we brought remain pending today . For those matters , I stress that the indictments contain allegations , and every defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty . In addition to the criminal charges we brought , as required by Justice Department regulations , we submitted a confidential report to the Attorney General at the conclusion of the investigation . The report set forth the results of our work and the reasons for our charging and declination decisions . The Attorney General later made the report largely public . As you know , I made a few limited remarks about our report when we closed the Special Counsel \u2019 s Office in May of this year .\nThird , our investigation of efforts to obstruct the investigation and lie to investigators was of critical importance . Obstruction of justice strikes at the core of the government \u2019 s effort to find the truth and to hold wrongdoers accountable .\nFinally , as described in Volume 2 of our report , we investigated a series of actions by the President towards the investigation . Based on Justice Department policy and principles of fairness , we decided we would not make a determination as to whether the President committed a crime . That was our decision then and it remains our decision today .\nLet me say a further word about my appearance today . It is unusual for a prosecutor to testify about a criminal investigation , and given my role as a prosecutor , there are reasons why my testimony will necessarily be limited .\nFirst , public testimony could affect several ongoing matters . In some of these matters , court rules or judicial orders limit the disclosure of information to protect the fairness of the proceedings . And consistent with longstanding Justice Department policy , it would be inappropriate for me to comment in any way that could affect an ongoing matter .\nSecond , the Justice Department has asserted privileges concerning investigative information and decisions , ongoing matters within the Justice Department , and deliberations within our office . These are Justice Department privileges that I will respect . The Department has released the letter discussing the restrictions on my testimony . I therefore will not be able to answer questions about certain areas that I know are of public interest . For example , I am unable to address questions about the opening of the FBI \u2019 s Russia investigation , which occurred months before my appointment , or matters related to the so-called \u201c Steele Dossier. \u201d These matters are the subject of ongoing review by the Department . Any questions on these topics should therefore be directed to the FBI or the Justice Department .\nAs I explained when we closed the Special Counsel \u2019 s Office in May , our report contains our findings and analysis and the reasons for the decisions we made . We conducted an extensive investigation over two years . In writing the report , we stated the results of our investigation with precision . We scrutinized every word . I do not intend to summarize or describe the results of our work in a different way in the course of my testimony today . As I said on May 29 : the report is my testimony . And I will stay within that text .\nAnd as I stated in May , I also will not comment on the actions of the Attorney General or of Congress . I was appointed as a prosecutor , and I intend to adhere to that role and to the Department \u2019 s standards that govern it .\nI will be joined today by the Deputy Special Counsel , Aaron Zebley . Mr. Zebley has extensive experience as a federal prosecutor and at the FBI , where he served as Chief of Staff . Mr. Zebley was responsible for the day-today oversight of the investigations conducted by our Office .\nI also want to again say thank you to the attorneys , the FBI agents , the analysts , and the professional staff who helped us conduct this investigation in a fair and independent manner .
